But most of the time the book I'm reading is a dull throb beneath my fingers, a soft hum behind my eyes, a lovely way to spend a bit of time in between things as I meander through my life. You know? It's something I adore, but softly, passively, and often forgetfully—very nice while it's happening, but flitting away quickly after I'm on to the next.And then sometimes there is a book that is more like a red hot fucking coal, a thrum nearly audible whenever I'm close to it, a magnetic pull that stops me doing anything else and zings me back so strongly that I just want to bury myself in its tinnitus at all times—five minutes in line a the bank, two minutes in the elevator, thirty seconds while my coffee date checks her email—gorging myself with sentences and paragraphs until the whole world recedes and shrivels into flat black-and-white nothing.This, this, this is one of those books. It's a book that bracingly reaffirms my faith in literature, making me endlessly astonished by its power and poise and brilliance. I know I am constantly chided for hyperbole, but this is truly one of the greatest books I've ever read. Probably it's a result of the endless march of mediocre books that plague the publishing industry these days—self-pub and traditional; I'm holding the major presses hella accountable too—but a book like this, so full and deep and flawlessly constructed, is just such a shock, such a pure clear joy. Every element is fucking perfect. Every element, truly! The plot, the characters, the pacing, the tone, all the little details, so so many tiny details, all perfectly, astonishingly slotted into place; the patois and the slang and the dialogue and the descriptions, oh my god the descriptions, from a smile to a chandelier to a mood; even the goddamn chapter epigraphs, which, who even reads those? But they're perfect, she's perfect, this book is just a knock-down, drag-out wonder. And it covers so much ground, with no shortcuts: from the Upper West Side moneyed elite to gambling addicts in the suburbs of Vegas, from a Lower East Side drug den for decadents gone to seed to the charming Christmastime streets of Amsterdam. Nothing is two-dimensional: if a characters restores furniture, you will learn so goddamn much about wood and veneers and myriad adherents; if another is a sailor, you will feel the wind in your hair and the goddamn spray of surf on your cheeks.Philosophy, art history, baccarat, heroin. Proust, childhood bullies, Russian drug-dealers. The cut of a jewel, the play of light through a crooked blind. The way a small dog remembers someone it hasn't seen in ten years. The way the very rich handle mental illness in the family. The way a teenage boy feels after taking acid for the first time. The bonds between people that last a lifetime, many lifetimes. The power of art to change a life, to change a million lives; the immortality of a work of art and the line of beauty that connects generation after generation of appreciators. How it feels to be always and ever in love with the wrong person—and how perfect and perfectly flawed she is, or he is, all the same. The way people age. The way people cling to each other at the wrongest of times, in the unlikeliest ways. The way people talk, my god, there is a Russian character (probably the best character in the book) who learned to speak English in Australia and you can really hear that fucking incomprehensible accent, the hitch of verbs mis-conjugated in just the right ways, the tossing out of slang words in four different languages, so casual and so perfectly apt. The way a life is made of recurrences, circlings back and back, openings out and out and out. What if one happens to be possessed of a heart that can't be trusted—? What if the heart, for its own unfathomable reasons, leads one willfully and in a cloud of unspeakable radiance away from health, domesticity, civic responsibility and strong social connections and all that blandly held common virtues and instead straight toward a beautiful flare of ruin, self-immolation, disaster? If your deepest self is singing and coaxing you straight toward the bonfire, is it better to run away? Ignore all the perverse glory your heart is screaming at you? Or is it better to throw yourself headfirst and laughing into the holy rage calling your name?Five stars, five hundred stars, five million. ALL THE GODDAMN STARS FOR DONNA TARTT FOREVER. "
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 3 out of 5,"Never have I been so conflicted about a book. Parts of it I loved. Parts of it I hated. Sometimes I wanted to praise it. Other times I wanted to abandon it. I'm relieved I've finally finished this novel (771 pages! Good grief!) because I can stop debating whether or not to keep reading it.It's difficult to talk about The Goldfinch without being spoiler-y, but I shall try. What I appreciated most was the lovely prose — some sections are truly beautiful. Donna Tartt can write an arresting paragraph, to be sure. Here is one that gave me pause:
""I don't care what anyone says or how often or winningly they say it: no one will ever, ever be able to persuade me that life is some awesome, rewarding treat. Because, here's the truth: life is catastrophe. The basic fact of existence -- of walking around trying to feed ourselves and find friends and whatever else we do -- is catastrophe. Forget all this ridiculous 'Our Town' nonsense everyone talks: the miracle of a newborn babe, the joy of one simple blossom, Life You Are Too Wonderful To Grasp, &c. For me -- and I'll keep repeating it doggedly till I die, till I fall over on my ungrateful nihilistic face and am too weak to say it: better never born, than born into this cesspool.""
So, yeah, this book is depressing. The story opens with a young boy, Theo, surviving a terrorist bombing in a museum, but his mother died and he feels responsible. Meanwhile, Theo steals a famous painting, one that shows a goldfinch chained to a perch, because his mother had loved the painting and he wanted to keep it safe. For the rest of the novel, the fate of the painting hangs in the balance. Theo agonizes over how and when to return it, and what crime he'll face. Eventually he ends up in the art underworld, caught in a complex scam.

The Goldfinch by Carel FabritiusSo the plot is rich and detailed, but my complaint was with the characters: I didn't like Theo, or his dad, or his dad's girlfriend, or his friend Boris, or Boris' girlfriend, etc. And Theo makes so many bad choices throughout the novel that it was difficult for me to care about what happened to him. Spending more than 700 pages without caring about the main character was a bit punishing. (And yet I kept reading! It's like I was that poor goldfinch chained to the book.)There was also too much written about repairing furniture, and WAY too much coverage of Theo's drug and alcohol abuse. I understand that he had post-traumatic stress disorder and that he was anxious and fearful, but I didn't need to read dozens of pages on how drunk and high he was. I don't think this novel had anything new to say about altered realities or making dumb decisions when you're bombed.While reading, I frequently made comparisons to Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities, a similarly long novel with an unlikable main character who gets caught in a dark web. Bonfire was considered the book that defined the '80s decade, and it seems like Goldfinch is poised to be the book that defines the post-9/11 era. I'm glad I've read it, but I'm even more glad I'm done with it.Update January 2014I finished this book about two weeks ago and when I talk about it with other readers, my most salient feeling is how anxious it made me. I was anxious about the painting. I was worried about Theo's survival. Boris and his kamikaze behavior made me jittery. The section in Amsterdam made me so uneasy I had to skim to get through it. I say this as a caution to other readers: This book is not a carefree or an easy read. You have been warned.Update February 2015It's been a year since I read The Goldfinch, and every time I see a copy of this book, I shudder. I cannot think of another novel I've read that made me feel more relieved to have finished it. I have heard friends say they had to abandon this book because it made them too anxious. Can you suffer PTSD from a book? If so, this one caused it."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 4 out of 5,"Oh, to be walking in New York on a weekday morning...on your way to an overpriced diner breakfast...stopping in at the Met...seeing a gloriously well put together exhibit of Dutch art...staring at a painting that changes your life…maybe the museum explodes, who’s to say?What I wouldn’t give for that right about now.I won’t be picky about the explosion. Reading this was a strange experience for me, one because it’s about eighty-seven thousand pages long (or 800), and two because I read it approximately a month into the stay at home order, and so even things like “having a bad trip and being injured with your friend in Las Vegas, and also you’re like twelve years old” and “suffering immense grief, but while sharing bunk beds with your pal in a gorgeous New York townhouse apartment” gave an overall effect of wow...outside...going places...with people?Divine.Plus, 800 pages gives you a lot of time to feel a variety of feelings. (Very astute of me, I know.) For the first 250 pages, this was a five star read for me. For the last 50 pages, it was also 5 stars.So generally speaking, if you pulled a book of normal length out of this gargantuan tome, that regular-sized volume would have been a perfect read for me. (#Synonyms.)However, there were 500 other pages, and those fell somewhere around 3 stars. Still, I get how they were necessary, and all the same I could spend the rest of my life only reading Donna Tartt’s writing and be content, so 4 stars seems like a more than fair compromise on my end.As with The Secret History, this was an utterly immersive reading experience for me, but in some ways even more so. In The Secret History, I felt separate from the narrator - so while I felt myself present on his campus and in his friends’ fancy New England lodgings, I was able to make up my own mind about characters at any given time.Not so with this one!I felt like I was Theo. I understand why he did everything he did. I felt his anxious protectiveness over the painting. I felt his need for love and belonging. And more to the point, I felt about all the characters who made up his life as I imagine (or know) that he did.I pine for a simple life of art and love in a Village townhouse with Pippa and Hobie (and I feel panicked to provide for Hobie, to prove myself to him, and in so doing prove that his love isn’t conditional even though I fear that it is by never ever giving him a reason not to love me). I feel dread mixed with love when Boris appears. I feel willing to resign myself to a loveless life of fulfilled expectations because I want to make someone happy, and I know that I can make Mrs. Barbour happy. Above all, I have a longing for Audrey like Theo does. I spent her absence from this narrative desperate for her to appear again.You don’t find stories like this often.Bottom line: For better or worse, this is an everyone-should-read-in-a-lifetime book.---------------currently-reading updatesday 7 update:- i finished- i miss it already- also it's day 8review to come / 4 stars---------------day 6 update:- i'm back on board---------------day 5 update:- i am LOSING STEAM---------------day 4 update:- maybe like 75 pages?- i forgot to even post this update which should tell you my mindset for this book yesterday---------------day 3 update:- about 100 pages done today- oh god am i entering a reading slump- pray for me - tell my family and my books i love them---------------day 2 update:- okay only like 50 pages today- at that rate i'll finish this book in 2029- i want very badly to go to a museum with Theo and his mom, which feels a bit on the nose in terms of my self-destructive tendencies---------------day 1 update:- 228 pages in- made a family tree for fictional characters for the first time in my life just to keep track- am ready to cancel all my plans, quit my jobs, and evolve past sleeping in order to dedicate all my time to this book---------------tbr reviewme: i want to read a book every day!!also me: i want to read this book, which is so long that picking it up is the closest i've ever come to weightlifting"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764994-rick,Rating 1 out of 5,"I have not read Tartt’s two previous, and by most accounts, superior novels. In The Goldfinch you can see that the talent is there but something is drastically off in the storytelling. The book drags and drags. It exasperates with unnecessary detail that calls annoyed attention to a critical lack of credibility throughout. The narrator is like one of those panhandlers who stop you on the street and provides too long a story about some travail: my mom and I were just mugged they took her to the hospital and I need to get to New Jersey to tell my dad who’s deaf but first I have to get to the hospital which is like a thirty minute cab ride away in Brooklyn and she needs this medication that was in her purse which got stolen but I didn’t get a chance to tell the EMTs about so I have to find a Duane Reade and get the prescription filled which costs about fifteen dollars if you could just help me out with part of it I’ll pay you back like tomorrow I have my address and phone number written down here I am really embarrassed and would never ever ask a stranger for help like this but this was our first ever trip to New York City and we never thought anything like this still happened but…. They are telling you so much because they want more than the average panhandler, not quarters or a buck but a ten or twenty. They hope the detail dazzles or distracts. However the more they tell you the more you know it’s all a lie. The extra details only betray.In The Goldfinch the betraying detail is in things large and small. Theo, the narrator, notices and remembers everything but no one else seems capable of noticing anything in the moment even when it’s their job to. As a reader you are left wondering, for example, would a teenager struggling in shock through a scene of devastation have noticed and remembered fourteen years later the names on office doors as he is trying to find his way out of a bombed building? You never believe that Theo could have left the museum without anyone noticing him, but he has to. So an immense amount of detail is added to provide a masking confusion. But if he was in the building long enough following the explosion for emergency personnel to arrive, begin rescue efforts, and then leave the building because of fear of another bomb, would there have been a door within the cordoned off perimeter that didn’t have police and emergency workers watching it?Reduced to a plot line everything in the story can be made plausible; transformed into 771 pages of excessive description and your skepticism is teased and taunted from the beginning and at every turn of the page.A book this long needs to be put down frequently: you are at your stop on the subway, it’s time to move a load of laundry from the washer to the dryer, time for a meal or bed. Only once did I put The Goldfinch down with regret that I couldn’t continue reading. Every other time I was relieved. At page 100, 200, and even at page 700 I wasn’t sure I was going to continue reading until the end. This isn't to say the Tartt can't craft a sentence, isn't well-read or a capable researcher, or smart as a whip. She can and is. But in execution this is tied for the most tedious and disappointing reading experience in 2013.The Goldfinch is the story of a stolen painting and a lost boy and the many bad decisions he makes, influenced by bad genetics and the bad example of his father, by the trauma of violence of the worst kind, and several kinds of dislocation. At no point does Tartt convince you that Theo is something other than a poorly realized grand idea and that the plot, character and actions are more than an academic exercise. The novel has been called Dickensian in its marketing campaign and by some critics. It has also made The New York Times’s list of five best works of fiction in 2013. Both facts baffle me beyond words."

5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15737072-gene-schmidt,Rating 1 out of 5,"This was a huge disappointment for me. The opening New York sections were excellent, the description of the museum bombing and the whole Mansfield Park thing Tartt has going with Theo and the Barbour family, all of this works beautifully. I was excited to keep on reading to see where it all ended up, but once things move to Las Vegas the story takes a seriously wrong turn. I seem to be a minority opinion here, but there you have it. I do remember sitting up all night in 1992 reading The Secret History. But this is something else...I have to wonder for whom Tartt thinks she's writing. Does she really imagine that intelligent adult readers are going to be enthralled with hundreds of pages detailing the antics of a pair of burned-out druggie teenagers who spend their time smoking weed, swilling vodka, and dining on packets of sugar and whatever junk food delicacies they can boost from the local supermarket? Well, perhaps they will, the book *is* on the NYT besteller list. But once all the hype and interviews die down...who knows? The comparisons to Dickens are particularly inappropriate. Dickens wrote about orphans and other unfortunates who are on the receiving end of undeserved bad luck, but his characters struggle *against* degradation and dissipation. Poor little Joe the crossing sweeper sleeps in Tom All Alone's because he has no other choice. But here Theo and Boris revel in their squalor and dissipation . (Boris is the kind of character who seems to exist only in books and movies: the burn-out loser druggie who is failing all his classes in school but is really a secret genius who reads Dostoevsky and Thoreau in his rare sober and lucid moments. Yeah...right. I've been to high school. Burn outs are burn outs).Nor is there any hint of Dickens' rollicking and life-affirming humor in the book. In fact there is no humor of any kind whatsoever (at least not as far as I read). Not a drop of wit. No one even cracks a halfway decent dirty joke.And then there is Theo's father, an inveterate gambler deep into the loan sharks, and his aging sexpot girlfriend Xandra...both potentially interesting characters, except they are presented in one-dimensional terms throughout their stay in the novel, and really exist for no other purpose than to end up the way they do (at least in the case of Theo's dad). Wasted opportunity. Too bad. I gave up halfway though the book. There is just such an incredible ugliness about all (or almost all) of the characters that I found I didn't care a damn what happened to them and certainly didn't want to spend any more time with them. The ironic part is that Tartt is an incredible writer, a master of descriptive prose, attentive to detail and able to create a truly believable world on the page. Too bad it's such a rotten world."

I'm not even half way yet and I'm wondering if I will be able to weather this ridiculously long book that keeps getting sidetracked by just about every teenage pothole you can think of. And can we talk about motherless orphans? I've lost track of how many motherless main characters are in this book. How can I be this far out of touch with other reviewers?------Halfway thru now. Spending lots of energy trying to be less harsh and trying to enjoy the ride tartt is taking me on. But I am not succeeding. This book is utter ridiculousness. Not believable at ALL. and this morning my friend informed me it was named Book of the Year. I'm speechless.---Three quarters done. Bottom line: Theo has become a very unlikeable guy. The pages and pages of minutia detail -- often building intrigue and suspense -- are pointless and often left unresolved. Reading this book reminds me of watching the tv show Lost. You think ""MAN. I wonder how they are going to explain that polar bear!"" Only to wait four more years and find out that they never do. ---Oh. My. Gosh. I just finished. The ending does not disappoint. What a diaphanous extravaganza of words. Of lists. Of never-ending stream of consciousness pompoonery. Yes. I made that word up. It's the merging of pompous and tom-foolery. Is Tartt serious? Can she really be seriously presenting up this book with a straight face? The ending is... Utterly astonishingly perfectly awful. If you are reading this and wondering if you should finish the book. Yes. Do it. Then report back here. I need the company. -----**Update on 4/1/14After 400+ comments to this review that was never meant for any purpose other than my own entertainment so that I might remember the book, I feel the need to add the following: To anyone wondering if they should still read this book, since reviewers are so divided (eg you either LOVE it or HATE it) : by all means, YES. Read it! But: if you find you are hating it within 100 pages, just put it down and walk away. Because it won't ever get better for you (Really. do as I say and not as I do: Put. It. Down.). For those who LOVE this book: Good for you! I am truly happy for you.

7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9485285-alan-wolk,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Goldfinch is a brilliant story with memorable characters and most of the book is incredibly well done and fun to read.""Most"" being the operative word.Tartt needed an editor to cut out a lot of the repetitive detail (Like several other reviewers, I too found myself page skimming -- sometimes the detail is fascinating, oftentimes it's unnecessary and just slows down the story.)There are a few other nits a good editor could have fixed, e.g. the internet makes cameo appearances but it's inconsistent - characters will make use of it in the way people do in 2013 but then later in the same scene they seem to forget it exists (and there's much more of the latter than the former-- Tartt recently did an interview with the New York Times where she admits to only using the web ""to look up phone numbers"" and her unfamiliarity is pretty evident, which is a problem in a novel whose main protagonists are 20somethings), a number of key plot points are telegraphed way in advance in a manner that feels more heavy-handed than than skillful, there are minor-but-critical unexplained plot points (e.g. why Theo's mother never considered leaving his father) whose omission seems curious in a novel that goes into such minute detail about everything else. And then of course there are the adult Theo's relationships with women, all of which seem overly chaste and prim and bloodless (especially compared to his relationship with Boris)-- even when he professes otherwise.There's a lot of Great Expectations in this novel-- I can't imagine it's coincidence that one of the main characters is called Pippa-- and Tartt frequently uses Dickens beloved device of the happy coincidence to move the plot forward. Usually Tartt makes the device work, but there are other times where the plot twists seem plucked from a forgettable TV movie of the week.The final chapter could also have used some heavier editing--"" philosophizing"" is a great way to end Theo's story, but the chapter just drags on forever, like a well meaning guest who won't stop saying goodbye.I gave it 4 stars because it's a really masterful story and the fairy tale quality makes it markedly different from so much of modern fiction. I just wish the editors would have had a heavier hand."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/296942-lisa-kelsey,Rating 2 out of 5,"As I read the reviews I am fascinated by the fact that I agree with aspects of many of them, whether they rate the book one, two, three, or even four stars. Even the positive reviews point out the very many flaws. I suppose it all comes down to what you are willing to tolerate in a novel. I found Tartt's writing to be at times quite lovely, but I got the feeling she is a little too enamored with her own skill. I am surprised to see the novel described as ""dense."" It was very, very (unnecessarily, in my opinion) long, but it was the opposite of dense. More like bloated--with lots of pretty fluff. When Theo is making his (again, long and mysteriously uninterrupted) way out of the Met in the beginning, I knew right away I was in for a severely under-edited read, and suspension of disbelief of inordinate proportions would be called upon.I am not a reader who must like or identify with the main character, or even any of them, but I do require them to at least be interesting or representative of a larger idea in some way, if not, then I at least want to be able to root for them. Here, I found the characters unlikable (except for Hobie and Pippa, but they just fade in and out) and with no real emotional resonance. Theo's mourning for his mother in particular, felt vaguely like a lovesick teenager's rendition of grief in a creative writing class. His relationships with women are so shallow and unconvincing as to suggest that he is deeply closeted. But with his lecturing at the end (pursuing what your heart desires, etc), I would think he would come clean on this point if that were the case.Even the discussion of the eponymous painting is lacking. It's as if the author didn't bother to research the piece--does she not know that Google exists? All the muddled philosophizing at the end left me unimpressed. In the end it was, in the words of Bart Simpson, ""just a bunch of stuff that happened."" A long, mostly tedious read with very little (or no) payoff.If you are like me and finish a book you start no matter what, I would seriously give the reviews here a read before committing to it."
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3587056-peggy,Rating 2 out of 5,"I, Boris, character in this book will give you honest opinion. Very honest. If you are reading this, asking yourself, should I read this book which is 771 pages? Very heavy, not that The Idiot was not 656 pages, so not length I am afraid of. If you are wondering, should I read? I answer for you already and say no! I am one of best things in book, at least not all the time moody, gloomy and so stupid I do not not even look in package. Even though I am very important character I must tell you, not worth your time to read this. (Okay to read beginning, some middle, end) but if was me, better to be having a pop than all the time reading about depressed guy who wastes so many good drugs. Bad things happen. All the time bad things. Does not mean cannot enjoy life. Does not mean should make many people spend very much money on depressing book. Not to say is not masterpiece to some people but why spend money on this misery. Cannot all own masterpiece. Potter think he is only one lose mother. In book we none of us have mother. Does not take 771 pages to figure this out. I would maybe read this if just 400 pages, as long as there would not be such long stretches without me. Potter needs me all the time. Not good without me. His one girl, Pippa, is smart not to let him make her into mother. If I was my good friend Theodore Decker and could not enjoy life at all I would do better job at killing self. Also honest opinion on how they say everyone is reading this book. If I tell you jump off cliff, you do it? Many times I drag Potter from middle of road where he claims to be waiting for car. Did I tell him lie in street? No. So I tell you. Only good thing can come from reading this book (maybe not even need to finish) is lots to talk about with people. Much discussion. Maybe if book from library or stolen worth it? But to buy own heavy copy? Could not even drop in canal without Dutch police all over you. Is better this way. ""Trust me."" "
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25375513-rick-riordan,Rating 5 out of 5,"Adult contemporary fiction. The Goldfinch was the book to read last year, so I didn't read it. Happily I corrected that over the last few weeks! It's the story of young Theo whose mother dies in a terrorist explosion at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. In the ensuing chaos, Theo escapes with his mother's favorite painting, The Goldfinch, a priceless Dutch masterpiece that becomes Theo's secret treasure and also the albatross around his neck. The story follows Theo into adulthood, through a series of tragedies and misadventures, until at last, he must face the music in regards to the missing painting. The novel is part coming-of-age story, part mystery, part rumination on the value of a human life versus the value of art. The writing is evocative yet accessible. The characters are wonderfully evoked. Tartt knows how to keep readers engaged with a compelling plot, yet the story is about much more than what happens to Theo and the painting. It's about loss and grief and loyalty. It's a remarkable read. I almost had to stop reading the book when Theo's ne'er-do-well father came on the scene because he was such an ass I wanted to strangle him, but later in the book, Tartt made even that character seem understandable, if not sympathetic. And Boris . . . what a creation! If nothing else, read this book to meet Boris."

He carries this symbol of grief and loss from early adolescence into an adulthood fraught with danger and beset by addiction. The long middle sequence, set in a housing development on the seedy, sand-blown outskirts of Las Vegas, is a standout. Tartt proves that the Dickensian novel—expansive and bursting with incident—is alive and well."

***Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction 2014. Congratulations Donna Tartt!***
”And I’m hoping there’s some larger truth about suffering here, or at least my understanding of it--although I’ve come to realize that the only truths that matter to me are the ones I don’t, and can’t, understand. What’s mysterious, ambiguous, inexplicable. What doesn’t fit into a story, what doesn’t have a story….Because--what if that particular goldfinch (and it is very particular) had never been captured or born into captivity, displayed in some household where the painter Fabritius was able to see it? It can never have understood why it was forced to live in such misery: bewildered by noise ( as I imagine), distressed by smoke, barking dogs, cooking smells, teased by drunkards and children, tethered to fly on the shortest of chains. Yet even a child can see its dignity; thimble of bravery, all fluff and brittle bone. Not timid, not even hopeless, but steady and holding its place. Refusing to pull back from the world.”

The Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius 1654This story begins with an act of terror in modern day New York, but this story could also be said to have started in 1654 when Fabritius, with deft hand, painted his masterpiece, a luminescent bird, a Goldfinch. Theo Decker is a child, with a mother obsessed with art. She frequently would skip buying lunch to have enough money to go to a museum. It is easy to give up food when one is about to nourish the soul. She in particular wants to see The Goldfinch and she wants to share that experience with Theo. ”She’d never seen a great painting in person until she was eighteen and moved to New York and she was eager to make up for lost time--’pure bliss, perfect heaven,’ she’d said, up to the neck in art books and poring over the same old slides (Manet, Vuillard) until her vision started to blur, (‘It’s crazy’, she’d said, ‘but I’d be perfectly happy if I could sit looking at the same half dozen paintings for the rest of my life. I can’t think of a better way to go insane.’)””We have art in order not to die from the truth.”----Nietzsche

In 1992 Donna Tartt had a pixie cuteness that inspired literary crushes from coast to coast.Donna Tartt is a master of language, but she really excels when she is composing people. This description of Theo’s mother manifested her before me as if she were flesh and blood in the room with me. ”She had black hair, fair skin that freckled in summer, china-blue eyes with a lot of light in them, and in the slant of her cheekbones there was such an eccentric mixture of the tribal and the Celtic Twilight that sometimes people guessed she was Icelandic. In fact she was half Irish, half Cherokee, from a town in Kansas near the Oklahoma border; and she liked to make me laugh by calling herself an Okie even though she was as glossy and nervy and stylish as a racehorse.”

The Dead Goldfinch by George Elgar HicksWhile at the museum a terrorist bomb explodes at a moment when Theo is separated from his mother. He never sees her again. Somehow in the confusion he walks out with an antique dealer’s ring that was placed in his hands by the dying owner, and the painting, The Goldfinch. Theo is placed with his friend Andy’s family for a time. They live on Park Avenue, and though they try their best to make him feel welcome it is impossible for him to ever feel like anything other than a charity case. ”Mrs. Barbour was from a society family with an old Dutch name, so cool and blonde and monotone that sometimes she seemed partially drained of blood. She was a masterpiece of composure; nothing ever ruffled her or made her upset, and though she was not beautiful her calmness had the magnetic pull of beauty--a stillness so powerful that the molecules realigned themselves around her when she came into a room.”For all Mrs. Barbour’s money and perceived social power she can not trump one thing...a blood relative. She feels guilty and relieved when Theo’s long gone, long lost, father appears. He has the scent of insurance money in his nose. He has a gambling addiction that rains money when he wins, but when he loses the vig requires a blizzard of money to fix. He sells off everything of his wife’s possessions that can be sold, and hauls Theo out to Las Vegas. NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!His father acted in a handful of bit parts in Hollywood for a few years before washing out. ”From the genial cursing, his infrequent shaving, the relaxed way he talked around the cigarette in the corner of his mouth, it was almost as if he were playing a character: some cool guy from the fifties noir or maybe Ocean’s Eleven, a lazy, sated gangster with not much to lose. Yet even in the midst of his laid-backness he still had that crazed and slightly heroic look of schoolboy insolence, all the more stirring since it was drifting toward autumn, half-ruined and careless of itself.”

I wouldn’t have thought it was possible to make Donna Tartt look like Gertrude Stein. Seriously who do I need to talk to about this?Theo’s father is not interested in parenting any more now than he was when he lived with Theo and his wife. In other words Theo is turned loose allowed to roam, and do whatever he wants to do. Theo meets Boris, a Russian kid with even less supervision than Theo, and falls into a hedonistic lifestyle of drugs and alcohol abuse that will haunt him for the rest of his life. The need to escape becomes a pattern that by necessity has to become more and more creative as he swims his way through a sea of pills and booze into adulthood. ”On the marble top of the dresser I crushed one of my hoarded old-style Oxycontins, cut it and drew it into lines with my Christie’s card and--rolling the crispest bill in my wallet--leaned to the tables, eyes damp with anticipation: ground zero, bam, bitter taste in the back of the throat and then the gust of relief, falling backward on the bed as the sweet old punch hit me square in the heart: pure pleasure, aching and bright; far from the tin-can clatter of misery.”I wonder if Tartt’s writing buddy, Bret Easton Ellis, was a consultant for the descriptions of drug use that are sprinkled throughout the novel. 

Bret Easton Ellis: drug, party, sex consultant.Meanwhile The Goldfinch follows along with Theo. Before leaving New York Theo returns the ring, that he was given at the museum, to a man named Hobie who turns out to be a business partner of the deceased man. Hobie is a furniture restoring expert. He keeps parts from unsalvageable antiques and uses those pieces to replace damaged sections on salvageable antiques. He also creates new pieces of furniture by marrying filigree to a plain piece as long as the wood dates from the same period. He is an artist. He calls these pieces of furniture his changelings. Theo soon realizes that most people are looking for a deal/steal and he has no difficulty acting the rube to play on their greed. He begins selling these changelings as real antiques. If someone complains he gives their money back and at the same time creates provenance that the antique came from their collection. He uses that provenance to sell the next person. Brilliant, illegal, but brilliant. He meets Pippa, who stays with Hobie from time to time. She was also hurt in the blast at the museum. When circumstances allow him to escape, the hell-hole called Las Vegas, he lands back on Hobie’s doorstep or should I say in much better proximity to Pippa.”Terrified she was going to catch me staring, unable to wrench my eyes away, I watched her studying my iPod with bent head: ears rosy-pink, raised line of scar tissue slightly puckered underneath the scalding-red hair. In profile her downcast eyes were long, heavy-lidded, with a tenderness that reminded me of the angels and page boys in the Northern European Masterworks book I’d checked and re-checked from the library.”Oh yeah, he’s got it bad...for life. Pippa is forever linked with his mother, not because she knew his mother, but because she entered his life at the very moment his mother left it. ”You can look at a picture for a week and never think of it again. You can also look at a picture for a second and think of it all your life.”Theo hasn’t been able to bear looking at The Goldfinch for a long time. It is an overwhelming cauldron of pain, guilt, beauty, loss, and lust on the order of Gollum’s passion for the One-Ring. If he looks at it too often he will become totally possessed. ”I thought of all the places I’d been and all the places I hadn’t, a world lost and vast and unknowable, dingy maze of cities and alleyways, far-drifting ash and hostile immensities, connections missed, things lost and never found, and my painting swept away on the powerful current and drifting out there somewhere: a tiny fragment of spirit, faint spark bobbing on a dark sea.”

Fabritius Self-PortraitSo there is a painting, stolen, carried all over the country, lost, found, stolen again, and finally found once more. So there is a boy blown up, lost, found, lost, lost, lost, and dare we to hope he is to be found once more? This book is full of beautiful, lyrical language, and a cast of characters that could have competed with a book from the Victorian era. I couldn’t help rooting for Theo in the same way that I rooted for David Copperfield and Oliver Twist. Even when he is surrounded by people, even people that would gladly offer him whatever help he could desire, he is lonely, caught in a cycle of grief that can’t be shared or unburdened. The life he was supposed to have was taken from him, and now he is chained to a bastardized life like Fabitius’s Goldfinch. A life that can never quite be understood, and a life made nearly unbearable by the memory of flight. ”For if disaster and oblivion have followed this painting down through time--so too has love. Insofar as it is immortal (and it is) I have a small, bright, immutable part in that immortality. It exists; and it keeps on existing. And I add my own love to the history of people who have loved beautiful things, and looked out for them, and pulled them from the fire, and sought them when they were lost, and tried to preserve them and save them while passing them along literally from hand to hand, singing out brilliantly from the wreck of time to the next generation of lovers, and the next.”See more of my writing at http://www.jeffreykeeten.com You can like my blog page on Facebook here.

(I have to admit that I cheated on it with some sci-fi YA releases and thrillers) Of the reason is 775 pages long journey cut my enthusiasm but at least it wasn’t bored me, I never intended to put it on my dnf list because it was a fabulous Dickensian book, so lyrically, mind-captivating-ly, memorably written. I wish I had the all the time on the earth to full concentrate on this story. Normally reading is the way for me to lose myself in words and I always act like I cannot hear the people blaring to my ears to get my attention! But for this book, I cannot have a luxury to connect with the outer world. I have to grab this one, leave on a helicopter and land on a private island bringing three things with me this book, a case of Chardonnay and my husband’s leftover meatballs( thanks God, one of us can cook and that’s not me!) In three amazing days I could end this book, get drunk, eat decent meal and get an amazing tan.  Well, I couldn’t achieve to realize this dream so I finished in 15 days and put more efforts to absorb each word because this book was like a chocolate lava cake for me, I never wanted to finish it and as I dig more I found more layers, new tastes to discover and enjoyed each second till it fully devoured!From the beginning my world rocked because MET is my sanctuary in NY. The bombing of one of the trade-marks of country is one of the effectively shocking ways of starting of a story. Theo Decker loses his mother at the attack and escapes from the explosion, unharmed, with a priceless painting named Goldfinch with him! Theo’s adventure continues at his new home as one of close friends of the family took him to Park Avenue apartment. Takes you to the journey to take a closer look to the Upper West high class elites and the elites with gambling addiction problem! Then you’re moving to Lower East Side drug circles, darkest dens and accidentally found yourself at Vegas suburbs. Then suddenly you open your eyes Amsterdam streets at Christmas.  It was depressing, heart-wrenching, hardly absorbing, sad story because every one’s ways to face with the grief and their losses were different. Some people could hardly move on from one of the stages. Denial was the most dangerous stage which resulted with self-harm. Mostly the self-guilt took the rest of strength Theo mustered mostly and forced him to self-harm.What I mostly liked is the genuinely developed characterizations which had significant resemblances with Dickens characters. This book may consist of some references of Great Expectations and I felt like I read some kind of amazing tribute to Dickens’ visualization. Of course Boris was my favorite!I enjoyed it so much but I’m not so sure the adaptation of the story to the big screen will be any good. In my opinion WORDS ARE STRONGER THAN ACTIONS AND IMAGES. Your visualization is always going to be better than what stands in front of you. And some books are not for adaption. Just like this one. So I prefer to skip the movie and later I plan to read this book again to discover different tastes, brand new perspectives and fully enjoy them!"

18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4058534-leeanne,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Goldfinchby Donna TarttThis is more than a beautifully written novel. It is a life philosophy and a love letter to great art. Life is full of struggle and hardship but the beauty we encounter along the way can make it worth living. **********************************************Three Medlars and a Butterfly by Adrian Coort“The Dutch invented the microscope,” she said. “They were jewelers, grinders of lenses. They want it all as detailed as possible because even the tiniest things mean something. Whenever you see flies or insects in a still life—a wilted petal, a black spot on the apple—the painter is giving you a secret message. He’s telling you that living things don’t last—it’s all temporary. Death in life. That’s why they’re called natures mortes. Maybe you don’t see it at first with all the beauty and bloom, the little speck of rot. But if you look closer—there it is.” The Goldfinch********************************************** One of many the joys of this novel are the visually striking and timeless descriptions of New York City. When the storyline shifts locations to the barren wasteland of suburban Las Vegas, it's a striking contrast. The visuals, characters, and stories are conveyed with such detail that they've became real people to me.Gapstow Bridge in Central Park, Manhattan, New York CityThe isolation and sprawl of tract housing in the outer suburbs of Las Vegas.********************************************** There are numerous references and allusions to classic literature woven throughout this book. The most explicit ones are to Dickens (Tartt is a huge fan) and to 19th Century Russian Literature, also known as the Golden Era of Russian literature. Theo is a modern-day Pip (Great Expectations). His artsy mother is named Audrey (Holly Golightly, Breakfast At Tiffany’s). A favorite Central Park bench Theo visits with his mom happens to be the same famous bench that Holden Caulfield visits (The Catcher in the Rye). Hobie is a modern-day Joe Gargery (Great Expectations). He's a kind, gentle man who rehabilitates furniture in a dusty antique shop (The Old Curiosity Shop). Theo's streetwise partner in crime, Boris, is a character reminiscent of The Artful Dodger (Oliver). Part of the book is named after Dostoevsky's novel, The Idiot. Boris spends several paragraphs of the book analyzing ""The Idiot"" and its dark, depressing message about life. Boris gives Theo the nickname ""Potter"" (Harry Potter) another orphan boy who lost his parents. This cute, wholesome reference is a sharp contrast to the lonely bleakness of Theo's life as an orphan. An old, wealthy Manhattan family, the Barbours, personify New York’s posh, upper-class life. They live in a richly decorated Upper West Side apartment stuffed with priceless furniture and large, dark oil paintings of naval battles. (The Age of Innocence, Great Gatsby). Art in almost every form is represented in the book: painting, music, film, cinematography, literature, even antique furniture restoration. I counted 36 works of classic literature referenced in ""The Goldfinch, 24 classic films, 20 iconic paintings, and a dozen iconic musicians and pieces of music. Characters in the book find meaning and purpose in their life through art and the creative process: Hobie through furniture restoration, Pippa through her music, Fabritius through his painting, Donna Tartt through prose. The last 10 pages of the novel pull the themes of the book to the surface. What if you do the wrong things in life, but for the right reasons? How does one differentiate the value v/s price of a work of art? What is the value of authentic work v/s a counterfeit? Life is harsh, cruel and so short; what's the point? Perhaps art gives us hope and helps make life worth living. You decide. Maybe there is no ultimate truth, no transcendent divine experience. Maybe the acts we commit out of love, are beyond good and evil. Perhaps the artist's job is, not to surrender to the emptiness of existence, but to find an antidote to counteract that feeling of emptiness. Maybe hope, even if it is just an illusion, is a reason to continue. Maybe the beauty we encounter in life is what makes it all worth living. It took ten years for Donna Tartt to finish this book. It was worth the wait."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was an exciting book and despite being nearly 900 pages long, was quite a page-turner. The characters were all drawn realistically and with all their flaws (with the possible exception of Hobie who was a lovable sweetheart!) The protagonist, Theo is also our narrator and is fairly reliable as he doesn't hold anything back - even his own many faults. The external narrative is on the fate of the painting The Goldfinch by Fabritius (about which we learn its own turbulent history and extreme genius throughout the narrative) following the explosion on page 34 and how this impacted Theo's life. The painting actually plays a very background position over most of the narrative and only comes centerstage again at the end of the book. Theo makes a lot of poor choices - unfortunately his father's sleazy girlfriend Xandra was right that he is far more like his father than he is willing to admit and yet in some of the best passages in the book, towards the end where Boris talks about Dosto's The Idiot:Maybe sometimes - the wrong way is the right way! You can take the wrong path and it still comes out where you want to be? Or, spin it another way, sometimes you can do everything wrong and it still turns out to be right.We know that despite Theo's tendency towards his dad, he is nonetheless a more genuine person and that Boris with all his external show of bravado - and of course his one big betrayal of Theo - he turns out to also to precisely the surprising but right thing in the end. It is to Tartt's credit that the book contained so much detail (and none of it boring or pedantic) about furniture, art, and literature (driving me crazy I cannot place the turning point scene in La Recherche between Swann and Odette that she refers to) which added a lot more depth and interest to the book. Personally, I think the length was fine - she had a lot of story to tell and did an excellent job telling.I love at the end also where Theo is traveling and tells us that one of the lessons he learned from Hobie was:...those images that strike the heart and set it blooming like a flower, images that open up some much, much larger beauty that you can spend your whole life looking for and never find.I found that to be a beautiful image and full of truth - like Plato's cave. Yet, another apt and thought-provoking insight from this rich and thought-provoking masterpiece. This was one time that the Pulitzer nailed it.On a side note, I made my own trek to the Mauritshuis museum in Den Haag years ago when reading Proust to see Vermeer's View of Delft and the Girl with the Pearl Earring but either the painting was traveling or I drifted right past it towards Rembrandt. Guess I need to return to the Hague!Her other two books were good, but this one was the best.I was in Den Haag at the wonderful Mauritshuis Museum and saw (again) the original Fabritius painting - absolutely stunning. Interesting tidbit: months after painting The Goldfinch, the artist and most of his work was blown up when the building his studio was in exploded.The film for this book is just coming out, hopefully, it will do the book some justice. And apparently, it was terrible. Oh well.On a second read, the book was just as awesome. Definitely one of my favorite books of the 2010s and the best Pulitzer winner of that decade!"
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek,Rating 3 out of 5,"Donna Tartt's latest novel has left this reader relatively unimpressed, especially considering the fact that she's author of The Secret History - a successful and popular novel which resulted in an entire generation of books which tried to be like it - and has reportedly spent 10 years writing The Goldfinch, which could very well be true, since she has written exactly three books in three decades. Understandably, her new novel became the object of much anticipation and when it was finally released it did so to rave reviews, with Stephen King calling it ""an extraordinary work of fiction"" and even the notoriously harsh Michiko Kakutani was charmed, and called the novel ""dazzling"". I confess to be genuinely puzzled by all the positive reviews, as the book that I've read overly long, very disjointed and overall surprisingly clumsy, considering the time it took to complete. This is a story which has all the potential of being great but is simply not told very well, and ultimately collapses under its own weight.Tartt begins The Goldfinch with what should have been a classic Hitchcock trick, but - thanks to the blurb which reveals it in advance - never even had a chance. Theo Decker - the main protagonist and narrator - is a 13 year old boy who is visiting New York's Metropolitan Art Museum with his mother, where they're viewing an exhibition of Renaissance Dutch art. Theo is charmed by a young girl who is visiting the museum with an elderly man, and wants to look at her a bit more, prompting his mother to go and take a look at her favorite paintings. Just after she disappears a bomb explodes, turning the museum and exhibition into rubble and dust. Theo miraculously survives, and notices that the elderly man he saw just minutes ago is dying - but manages to call Theo, and gives him his ring with an address. Theo sees him pointing at a painting which somehow has escaped unscathed, freed from its frame by the explosion, and understands that the man wants him to save it. The painting is a famous one - its Carel Fabritius's The Goldfinch, a favorite of his mother's. Theo decides to take it and leaves the museum, later learning that she was killed in the blast.Theo can't cope with the fact - he and his mother have been very close since his abusive father has left the family several years ago. Effectively orphaned and scared by the prospect of living with elderly and uncaring relatives which the social service agents want to impose on him, Theo manages to secure temporary residence with his friend Andy and his family - the Barbours. He suffers from survivor's guilt, blaming himself for his mother's tragic death and can't imagine having to live without her. Tartt takes her time to illustrate Theo's misery and slow recovery from grief as he lives with the Barbour family - a group stunted and odd in their own way. Until one day Theo's father unexpectedly shows up with his girlfriend, and takes Theo to live with them in their house in Las Vegas.This is the point where the novel loses its ground and never regains it. Theo's father - a gambler who walks on the thin rope hanging over the great ocean of casinos, filled with loan sharks - and his girlfriend, Xandra, who is not sure what to make of Theo. They're both interesting characters but remain woefully underused and undeveloped - there's a glimmer of a great plot involving Theo's father and his experiences with those who run the Casinos which is then literally and quite unceremoniously dropped, and remains unresolved for hundreds of pages - and when it finally is mentioned again you almost wish that it was forgotten altogether, since the way Tartt ""solved"" it is truly that lame. A total cop-out and a shame, as it essentially ended what could be a fascinating part of the book. Also, when did the setting stop being important? After being treated to minutiae descriptions of New York and its environs, Las Vegas is basically skimmed over - all we learn about it is the fact that it's in the middle of a desert and that its full of scorching sunlight.The adjective ""Dickensian"" gets used a lot in reviews of this book, but I don't think its deserved - unless a novel whose main character is an orphan somehow becomes ""Dickensian"" by association (to Tartt's credit she inserts a literal Old Curiosity Shop with a Kindly Older Guardian Figure into the book too). Since Theo can be seen as a contemporary Oliver Twist, here enters the charismatic character who will play his Artful Dodger - a Ukrainian teenager named Boris.Boris is the type of character which can only exist in fiction, and is a rather cartoonish composite of various stereotypes that Westerners have about Russians, Ukrainians and other Slavic people (at least his name isn't Ivan). Boris is a character who does not stay away from alcohol an drugs (of course), and has a rich father who unfortunately is also an abusive alcoholic (I think we've seen that before). Boris also deals with drugs and has connection to the underworld (I guess the usual poor black teenager drug dealers wouldn't be exotic enough), but in reality is a genius (when sober) who is able to converse in several languages, has seen half the planet (his homeland ranks the lowest - of course), and reads Dostoevsky and other ambitious literature in original in his spare time, when not drugged out of his mind. In the real world it simply does not happen - you'd be surprised to see how quickly irresponsibility combined with drugs can extinguish the brightest of fires. Boris's cartoonishness comes as a weird contrast to Theo, whom Tartt tried to portray realistically and convincingly.The antics of both Boris and Theo make me lose whatever sympathy I could have had for him - he was a whiny and uninteresting kid, but anyone would be a little shaken if their mom exploded. But neither he or Boris are Dickensian characters. Dickens wrote about orphaned children who struggled through life, but they struggled against the condition the world threw them into. Oliver Twist ends up with Fagin because he was swayed by the Artful Dodger, who himself knew no other life. Pip in Great Expectations strives to be a gentleman to impress Estella, whom he pursues. Contrary to that, both Theo and Boris openly embrace the squalor and disintegration, reveling in drug-fueled stupidity, antics and parties. There is no warm humor so familiar to anyone who has ever read a Dickens novel, and not even an shade of anything which could have passed for a portion of his wit.The novel then moves back to New York, and then across the seas to Amsterdam - in a sequence of events which would suggest that Tartt came up with a series of ideas for several novels and tried to connect them all into a great, big one, which didn't work out. There is even a love story here, but the love interest is nothing more but a prop used to make it happen - she's not fleshed out to be a real person, and is made to look like a forever unreachable mysterious pixie girl. The painting which Theo took from the museum - the Goldfinch - is forgotten for hundreds of pages until it is suddenly mentioned again, and what should have been a major issue in the book - will Theo ever get rid of it, and if he does - how? - gets ""solved"" in what has to be one of the most anticlimatic resolutions of contemporary literature. In her review Kakutani has admitted that Tartt's sequence of events are highly improbable, but wrote that startling coincidences and sudden reversals of fortune is just Tartt being adept at ""harnessing all the conventions of the Dickensian novel"". I call bullshit and say that this is just an excuse for lazy and incompetent plotting. A plethora of impossible coincidences shouldn't be so easily accepted - Dickens wrote his novel in installments for newspapers, prety much making the story up as he went on. Sometimes he ran himself into a corner an had to resort to an impropable chain of events - but then he had a week to publish the next chapter of his novel, while Tartt had ten years.The novel picks up the pace in the last third, which is the tightest and most frenetic part of the book...until it arrives at the conclusion, which is when I began to wonder if Tartt wrote it with a straight face and if the hundreds of pages were not a simple buildup to one giant prank. The ending of The Goldfinch is worthy of a hungover Paulo Coehlo phoning it in on a bad day, and contains the worst of pompous maudlinism disguised as revelation. It feels tacked-on as an afterthought, and makes the reader wonder if the character is consciously engaging in pseudo-intellectual posturing or is genuinely one of the biggest blockheads in contemporary literature.Ultimately, The Goldfinch is a disappointing book - especially considering the wait time and all the hype that surrounded it. I gave it an extra start for Donna Tartt's writing - she does have a talent for constructing nice sentences here and there - but it does not warrant the 800 pages that it is printed on. Like the saying goes - a picture paints a thousand words, but thousands of words couldn't paint this picture."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4593541-barry-pierce,Rating 4 out of 5,"Donna Tartt is one of America’s greatest living male writers. She has taken a form of novel - the doorstopper, the tome, the phonebook - and taken something away from it that is has often never been without: the penis. In this ritual castration of the ‘opus’ Tartt has managed to completely free it from all its ills. DeLillo, Franzen, Foster Wallace, Pynchon, Mailer, all kneel there, bloodied and shorn like Goya etchings, John Bobbitts by any other name, weak and utterly defeated. Whilst Donna, looking like what Timothée Chalamet will eventually become, stands defiant, a bouquet of dicks in hand, laughing.Carel Fabritius’ 1654 trompe-l’œil The Goldfinch is an odd little painting. Fabritius only uses about 40% of the canvas for his painting of the little bird. The rest is a sea of nothing, but it’s enjoyable nothing. Donna Tartt’s 2013 novel The Goldfinch is an odd little book. Tartt only uses about 40% of the novel for the plot and its development. The rest is a sea of nothing, but it’s enjoyable nothing.People gushed over this book when it came out. Absolutely soiled themselves. I scarcely recall any other book in the five years since The Goldfinch came out that has had anywhere near the same amount of complete domination. I mean, it was all, of course, deserved. No other writer has written anything like this since, nor has anyone even tried. It must have been like when Michelangelo did the Pietà and every other artist in Renaissance-era Italy was like ‘well fuck me right!? fuck MY still lives’.I didn’t read it at the time. I was still disillusioned by how much I did not enjoy The Secret History. I know, I know, I didn’t like The Secret History. I think it was because I actually saw too much of myself in the characters, and they’re all detestable. A similar thing happened with Eugenides’ The Marriage Plot, a fucking awful novel full of characters just like me. People often complain about never seeing themselves in books, my problem is I can’t seem to escape myself.And I found myself again in The Goldfinch. In Theo. This time it didn’t cause me to throw the book across the room however. I mean, Theo is insufferable. Everything about him just reeks, really. But god is he loveable. The broken male teen. Holden Caulfield wishes. Then there’s also Hobie. Ah Hobie. Sweet, clueless Hobie. I will do everything in my power to protect you.Plot-wise we’re a bit fast and loose here aren’t we? That Vegas bit went on didn’t it? And the entire second-half? Whew. Michi Kakutani was jumping over herself with the Dickens comparisons in the NYT. But you really couldn’t be farther from Dickens. The thing with Dickens was it was all plot. You could never say nothing happens in Dickens, if anything too many things happen. Also she compares Theo to Pip when he’s clearly David Copperfield. I’m glad she retired. Anyway this is meant to be a review of The Goldfinch isn’t it? Eh, yeah, it’s great. I really loved it. Patchy. But great. Some bits needed polishing. But great. Couple characters could’ve been cut. But great. The whole marriage thing? But great. Also I’ve decided to give The Secret History another go. I feel the problem is me. Not the book. But The Little Friend can eat my entire ass."
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22189348-adina,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. This is the second book by an American author that I gave 5 stars. I've been looking for a while to read an American masterpiece (by my tastes) and I finally found it. I believe it totally deserves the Pulitzer Prize. This book has almost everything. Beautiful prose and flow of the words and the story, Donna Tartt is wonderful. It is gripping but in an unexpected way. At the beginning of the book the action is quite static. However, I could not wait to get home everyday and read a few more pages. The pace picks up at the end, I read the last 200 pages in one go. It has suspense,adventure, love, drugs, Russian gangsters, gambling, art etc. But most of all this book is about suffering, loss and incapability ( unwillingness) of the main character to be happy. His torments, his addictions for drugs or love and his journeys out of addiction are very hauntingly presented. Anyways, even if it is not an easy read in terms of some of the subjects touched it is definitely worth it. "
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 5 out of 5,"Update again: Thoughts on the movie: (opened today in our area) >>> just saw it!If you have not read the book -- the movie might be confusing. Its VERY SLOW --VERY LONG -- It didn't transfer to the big screen well. Donna Tartt's book is brilliant -- the movie much less so. Yet--I'm still glad I saw it. A few things work!My suggest to people going to see it --KNOWING it won't be as good as the book -(its definitely not) - is to PLAN on sitting back for almost 3 hours (It feels like 3 hours anyway: but its not quite that long) -- Go into a meditative type space -- RELAX.... you can't rush the movie --It won't speed up just because you want it to. I had a cold drink to sip -- and enjoyed my lounging seat...and just surrendered into the slow moving length of the film. Theo --the main character in The Goldfinch is NOT my favorite actor in the film. His friend, Boris is.The casting for Boris was EXCELLENT....The casting for YOUNG Theo was 'off' in my opinion. Did we really need another main kid to look like Harry Potter? I think not!!! The older Theo was better.Nicole Kidman was fine in her role. The old man of the antique shop was perfect in his role. Also - the antique shop was visually great. The best visual that totally fit the way I visualized it in the book were the houses in Las Vegas. Those homes were 'exactly' as I pictured it. The movie does not move in the same chronological order as the book. It jumps around--backward- forward - young Theo - and old Theo. The clothes were good -- fitting with the times -- The bombing special effects in the museum -- (done as flashbacks) - were done well -- but I would have preferred it to have followed the chronological order of the book -- Its very effective in the book -- a little on the late side in the movie. so-- overall --not great -- but I'm glad I saw it. SLOW.....expect 'very' slow in the beginning -- We get use to the slow pace after about an hour into it....haha!Others? Your thoughts on the movie? Love to hear your take -- I LOVED the kid who played Boris!!! Absolutely my favorite actor in the film!! UPDATE.... I read this 6 years ago -- (in 4 days if my memory is correct). I remember where I sat --my feelings -- and later my local book club gathering-discussion. I read and wrote this six year old review before it won The Pulitzer Prize.I'm seeing the movie Friday afternoon. Anyone else going this Friday --or over the week-end? Maybe we can all chat about the movie?/! --- compared to the book!:)AMAZING!!! My personal FAVORITE book of the year!!! The story was delicious! The writing WONDERFUL! I've picked some of Donna Tartt's writing to share that I deeply enjoyed: 1) On page 335: ""We looked at each other and just laughed; everything was hysterically funny, even the playground slide was smiling at us, and at some point, deep in the night, when we were swinging on the jungle gym and showers of sparks were flying out of our mouths, I had an epiphany that laughter was light, and light was laughter, and that this was a secret of the universe. For hours we watched the clouds rearranging themselves into intelligent patterns; rolled in the dirt, believing it was seaweed (!); lay on our backs and sing ""Dear Prudence"" to the welcoming and appreciating stars. It was a fantastic night -- one of the great nights of my life, actually, despite what happened later."" WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!! RIGHT?????2) ""Me --well, maybe I didn't have a girlfriend or even any non-drug friends to speak of but I worked twelve hours a day, nothing stressed me out, I wore Thom Brown suits, socialized smilingly with people I could not stand, swam twice a week and played tennis on occasion, stayed away from sugar and processed foods. I was relaxed and personable, I was thin as a rail, I was an excellent salesman -- everyone said so -- and business was so good that what I spent on drugs, I scarcely missed."" I STILL LAUGH just TYPING that SENTENCE! This author --IMO ---is EXCEPTIONAL --beyond EXCEPTIONAL!!! I'm in 'aw'!!!!I wish I could thank her for the incredible experience I had with her book!"
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10620721-jo,Rating 1 out of 5,"Whaaaaat? Am I reading a different book from all of you people giving this five stars? I am halfway through this pretentious, nonsensical, self-indulgent, ridiculous THING, and I'm only forcing myself to finish because I paid $40 for this monstrosity. It is unconvincing on so many levels. Theo Decker does not ring true. He doesn't SOUND like a boy, for a start, and I'm hard-pressed to believe a thirteen-year old reads and understands the likes of Chekov, Thoreau and Emmerson. And why doesn't Theo have a cellphone? Tartt seems reluctant to accept that her book is set in the 21st century- even the laptop is locked away in his Dad's bedroom so emails are sparse- so why not set it in 1962 or somewhere more plausible? And Boris- what a ridiculous, implausible character: a polyglot who has lived all around the world in his fifteen years, had dazzling adventures, survived regular beatings from his equally unlikely father, spends a good part of his life starving and/or drunk, and has found time to read Chekov in Russian. His Soviet-flavoured lectures on the virtues of stealing only from faceless corporations make him sound like he's fifty. Every other character I've encountered so far is as flat as the paper its printed on. Mrs Barbour: aloof, icy Society Matron. Theo's dad: Bad Parent,only cares about money. Xandra (With an X, which takes about 200 words to explain):Trailer-Park Whore with a wee soft spot for furry animals.The Latino Doormen: Latino Doormen. Hobie: Dumbledore.The plot limps along. After the initial set-up (Mum dies in a bomb blast at an art museum and Theo washes up an almost-orphan, which takes forever), things just slope along with no real tension, mystery or sense of purpose to drive you from one page to the next. And EVERYTHING- each object, setting, conversation, item of clothing, facial feature, crack in the sidewalk, cloud in the sky,item of furniture,swirl of vomit in the toilet bowl - EVERYTHING thing is described in minute and tedious detail, irrespective of its relevance to anything at bloody all. I skipped whole pages I could see were going nowhere. Boris and Theo get drunk again and have a fight? Woohoo! Boris gets the bash from his dad? So what- nothing happens as a consequence, and the boys carry on like two washed up old tramps from a Beckett play - oh, but pardon me for dropping in a pretentious and pointless literary allusion to a text read by no thirteen-year-ever.Or to every orphan story every written- Harry Potter, Great Expectations, Huck Finn (who Boris is supposed to be I suppose). It's probably meant to be terribly clever but just seems obvious.And another thing. Dialogue is peppered with question marks at the end of sentences which aren't questions. I suppose it's to indicate an upward vocal inflection? Like how teens speak? It's silly and irritating. Sigh. I suppose there is some symbolic MEANING to the painting of the goldfinch and I suppose the girl with the red hair will reappear sometime to break Theo's heart (if he's not gay, which it sort of sounds like he is)- but there is no urgency, no ticking clock, nothing to make me care one way or another. 300 pages to go. Wish me luck.*UPDATE*I finished it. Tempted to increase the rating to two stars because it does improve a little halfway through- at least the plot picks up. There is a PROBLEM all of a sudden (the missing element in the first half), which makes things a little interesting, if no more believable. I was right about the girl (so too predictable) and almost right about the other thing. But (Spoiler Alert)- how is it remotely possible that Theo would not have heard of the death of Andy and (silly name) Chase? Did he not read a paper or watch the news for eight years? They were New York Society, so their sudden demise would hardly go unremarked. And Boris's reappearance is just too coincidental. And the relationship issue: again, not at all believable. Surely Kitsey /Cutesy can make up her own mind about a man and not choose one just to please Mummy, especially knowing he is a total stoner. The endless drug-taking is really tedious too. But back to the Problem; here's the problem with the Problem. The solution to the Problem is so simple, so easy, so obvious and so anti-climactic that it should have occurred to everyone two hundred pages earlier and saved me several hours of my life I'll never get back. And the ending- oh spare me- fifty-something pages that go on, and on, and on about Beauty and Art and Meaning. Which is all very noble and true I guess but so many others have said the same thing so much better, in fewer words. Still one star."

You get the picture. There were moments when I was so choked with emotion that the boyfriend would pass me tissues as soon as he heard a sniffle. The loss of Theo's mother, his love of Hobie and Pippa, the comfort of the Goldfinch, the restrained desire for Boris and a few other emotional moments. These moments were poignant, heavy with gorgeousness and clearly unforgettable.50% was like watching an art house film by Gregg Araki mixed with reruns of Melrose Place. I know this sounds strange but this is exactly what this was like for me. Truly entertained but rather numbing and in the end extraneous.20% was gently trying to cajole Ms. Tartt (telepathically) to please cut out huge sections of the book that were superfluous, exhausting and unnecessary.15% siliently and sometimes not so silently cursing Ms. Tartt for the written diarrhea that one has to go through until you get to another one of those absolutely stunning sections that were written about above.Ms. Tartt when you are ""on"" you are ""bang on"" but please please please find another editor."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi,Rating 5 out of 5,"""—if a painting really works down in your heart and changes the way you see, and think, and feel, you don’t think, ‘oh, I love this picture because it’s universal.’ ‘I love this painting because it speaks to all mankind.’ That’s not the reason anyone loves a piece of art. It’s a secret whisper from an alleyway. Psst, you. Hey kid. Yes you.""Finally!! This book! I put off reading Donna Tartt for far too long. This book in particular was on and off my list for quite some time. I can’t say why really. Call me capricious, I guess. Then in November 2019, I read The Secret History and kicked myself for not having read Tartt sooner. On finishing that superb work of literature, I knew I’d pick this one up at long last. For once my dawdling paid off though. I couldn’t have picked a more perfect time to read this most excellent novel!Last week, I was supposed to be in New York City for the first time in ages, having last been there on a field trip with a bunch of fellow teens. This was a vacation I was so highly anticipating. There would be trips to the theater, the Met, and Central Park. I was going to stuff myself with as much ethnic cuisine as I could possibly handle without making myself sick. AND… I would be visiting the Strand Book Store for the very first time!! Well, as they say, the best-laid plans… How very sorry I was to have to cancel this trip; how even more heartsick I was to hear of the devastation in that vibrant city as the result of something virtually invisible yet so deadly as this damn virus that has shut down the entire world. One consolation until this evil is eradicated – The Goldfinch. It was a life saver for me, as books so often are. Plus, I got to indirectly spend a good chunk of time in NYC immersed in these pages.There are plenty of other fabulous reviews out there if you are interested in gleaning a bit more about the plot. I’m just going to say that this book has it all, really. First and foremost, the prose is exceptional. I’m all about the writing these days. Secondly, these are wholly believable characters, full of imperfections just like real people. Even when I didn’t agree with many of their actions, I never felt that Tartt was asking us to judge them. I never felt the need to judge them; I rooted for them no matter those flaws. I can see where Theo Decker might be a bit of a turnoff to some readers. For me, however, there was something about him that just crushed me and drew me to him. I guess you could say, I understood him, despite our superficial differences. There was something at the core of him that gnawed away at my heart. ""I’d felt drowned and extinguished by vastness—not just the predictable vastness of time, and space, but the impassable distances between people even when they were within arm’s reach of each other, and with a swell of vertigo I thought of all the places I’d been and all the places I hadn’t, a world lost and vast and unknowable, dingy maze of cities and alleyways, far-drifting ash and hostile immensities, connections missed, things lost and never found…""And then there was Theo’s best friend, Boris. This guy! Sometimes I wanted Theo to get as far away as possible from him and other times I was wishing him right back with us. Mostly, he made me smile. Wise Hobie and the lovely Pippa definitely won me over. The settings are brilliantly illustrated – from the vitality of New York City to the dust and depravity of Las Vegas to the charm of Amsterdam. Of course, there is a cleverly plotted storyline that made this another step up from just your everyday ‘good’ book. Despite its length coming in at over 775 pages, I was captivated in its entirety. There’s too much to say about this masterpiece - more things I could say about the meaning of art, about the choices we make, about love and death. About life. I was completely consumed by the ending pages. I couldn’t help but think of this novel in terms of our current situation. For this reason, I believe it will forever hold an extra special place in my heart. I have one more full-length Tartt novel to delight in. It will take a lot of willpower not to rush to it right away! The Goldfinch is headed to my favorites shelf.""That life—whatever else it is—is short. That fate is cruel but maybe not random. That Nature (meaning Death) always wins but that doesn’t mean we have to bow and grovel to it. That maybe even if we’re not always so glad to be here, it’s our task to immerse ourselves anyway: wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open. And in the midst of our dying, as we rise from the organic and sink back ignominiously into the organic, it is a glory and a privilege to love what Death doesn’t touch."" "
27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi,Rating 5 out of 5,"Winner of the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Congratulations, Ms. Tartt on such a stunning return. The Goldfinch is a doorstopper, weighing in at over 700 densely written pages. Yet, I found myself tearing through it as if I couldn't read it fast enough. I don't know what the secret is to Ms. Tartt's prose, but I dig it. I dig it a lot. Maybe it's due to sheer deprivation (absence making the heart grow fonder and all that jazz), because this lady, while her talent goes undisputed, has only managed to pen three novels in three decades -- the very antithesis of James Patterson (whom I wish would just go away -- how many trees have to die for you, Jim? HOW MANY?) I can be a real sucker for a sense of place. Tartt writes New York in such a way that I was able to feel the thrum of traffic and smell the bakeries (and the sewers). Taxis, doormen, park benches, museums, lunch counters -- all swirling together in a portrait that's as carefully rendered as any artist's painting. When she transplants readers to the parched and desolate Las Vegas suburbs, I became just as enthralled by the startling contrast between bustling city and dry desert. There's really not much to say here other than I became totally immersed in this book while I was reading it. It's a character-driven piece in the sense that it's without an intricate plot, or Big Reveals. But oh, what characters! All the feels! It was just such a heartening experience to get to know them all and watch them hurl through life together, for better and for worse. It's the characters from which we draw the tension and the pace of the story and it's all so deftly handled by Ms. Tartt that I'm actually left floundering for ways to adequately describe it. So I won't. Let her take you on this journey and I'll get the hell out of the way. "
28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2386804-mj-nicholls,No Rating,"“Pithy and irrelevant quote from philosopher to make this review sound important.” — Bobby McFerrinLong out-of-context passage from the novel in italics unrelated to the stuff I am about to discuss in the review that sort of hangs there seeking an explanation and that also sounds somewhat profound and rubs off some cred on me for picking out such a seemingly perfect and deep-sounding line to whet your appetite even though you have probably skimmed the whole thing because you fail to see the relevance. (p679) Big hyperbolic opening. I have been to the Himalayas, Easter Island, Neptune, and Dundee, and never have I encountered words on the page that have rocked me to the core of my deep deep soul as this. I have kissed Cardinal Ratzinger’s mitre, Warren Zevon’s left pinkie, and Liam Neeson’s elbows, had five marriages and nine divorces, but nothing in my whole entire life compares to when I sat down and read this big-because-the-font-is-huge doorstop that everyone else loves and W.H. Smith agrees is a masterpiece. Now for the strange, shrink-ready “personal” response. Emotions can be emotional. We can gaze into our souls and find dark things there, like old bananas or burnt toast. Sometimes overcoming struggle can be a struggle and we need the love of loved ones to help us overcome the emotional struggles with our loved ones. Out hearts beat like metronomes alongside the hearts of everyone else on the planet’s hearts, which beat similarly, unless they have stopped. Those people are dead. Our families can be terrible and drive us to do crazy things, like burn down the house and run off with a My Chemical Romance groupie who leaves us penniless in the pub toilets after taking our virginity. It is reassuring to know that there are always people there for us, if we have enough mobile credit and remember the hotline to the Samaritans. Further exaggeration as to how this book changed my life, without ever getting into the specifics. The characters. The plot. The words. The pages. These have reshaped the entire structure of my life and will sit deep inside my heart forever, until the next book comes along that does the same thing and offers me the same reaction and I write the same review but with different swooning self-important waffle that is really about ME and MY LIFE and not really about the book at all, and shows that these books are never really appreciated for their artistry, but for the way they appear to touch our lives and appeal to the feelings and emotions we think we have that make us good people, when we aren’t too busy going about the everyday business of gratifying ourselves and never demonstrating one tenth of this well-deep so-called love-of-the-world by being kind to a person we haven’t allowed into our private little bubble of pre-tested and pre-approved people.Read this because I am more important than all of you. Now give me my 1,829 likes and I will ignore your comments except the ones that say how amazing I am. "

And it was so dark!At times I needed to take a break, because it was just so heavy (both physically and metaphorically) some of the themes and thoughts the main character had were so awful, I was feeling depressed just to read it!  “Even the sidewalk felt like it might break under my feet and I might drop through Fifty-Seventh Street into some pit where I never stopped falling.” Not that it was all bad, there was plenty that wasn’t as dark. But the overriding themes were just so tough. Theo’s Mum dies in a bomb explosion in the museum in New York, so he is forced to move to Las Vegas and live with his dad, a recovering alcoholic with a now severe gambling addiction. Theo’s time here, though only 15 years old is rife with alcohol and more drugs than you’ve ever seen! He and his best friend Boris were seriously messed up. Theo has been carrying with him a painting stolen from the museum where his mum died. The Goldfinch, worth so much it is actually priceless, given to him by a dying man. When Theo returns to New York he stays with the old partner of the dying man, Hobie, in the antiques shop they ran together. Theo and Hobie run the business together, all the while Theo still has The Goldfinch hidden. No one knows he has it - or do they?This is an epic tale spanning decades of Theo’s life, it covers so much ground, but I finished it not feeling overly satisfied and there were times I was really pushing myself through. Glad I’ve read it, but I definitely need something lighter now as this book was not great for my mental state.  “None of us ever find enough kindness in the world, do we?” "

E subțirică, mignonă, transparentă, imponderabilă. Te privește cu un chip angelic, ermetic, androgin.Părul tăiat scurt, împărțit în două de o cărare pe dreapta. Ochi căprui, „de culoarea mierii”, precizează o gazetă franțuzească. Ten palid de călugăriță (tot de acolo). În interviuri a fost foarte discretă cu viața personală. Nu știm dacă se plimbă pe bicicletă. Știm, în schimb, că scrie numai de mînă cu cerneluri de culori diferite, pe hîrtie de culori diferite. Nu folosește laptopul. J. K. Rowling avea un public de copii de gimnaziu. Donna Tartt i-a cucerit pe urmașii lor, adolescenții cu probleme mari, insolubile. Publicul ei se situează undeva în jurul vîrstei de 18-21 de ani. De la J. K. Rowling la Donna Tartt trecerea a fost lină, firească, într-un cuvînt: necesară. În 2013, cînd s-a publicat Sticletele (al treilea ei roman), lansările s-au urmat una după alta, într-o succesiune de evenimente atent regizată. A fost o sărbătoare continuă. Un triumf. O baie de mulțime. Mai întîi, s-a lansat traducerea olandeză (pe la începutul lui octombrie), apoi a venit originalul englezesc (pe 22 octombrie), apoi traducerea suedeză (către sfîrșitul lunii).Recenziile, în unanimitate, au consemnat entuziasmul specialiștilor. Într-o cronică din The New York Times, venerabila Michiko Kakutani (Pulitzer Prize 1998) a epuizat dintr-o singură mișcare, pe cîteva coloane de elogii, toate epitelele pozitive ale limbii engleze. Sticletele reprezintă „a Dickensian novel”, o capodoperă, o poveste genială. Alții au arătat că Donna Tartt este nu numai un mare scriitor, un incomparabil prozator, dar și „un gigant al literaturii contemporane” („a slow-burn literary giant”). În cîteva săptămîni, cartea s-a vîndut într-un milion și jumătate de exemplare (pe hîrtie sau în PDF). A fost tradusă în 32 de limbi.În 2014, Donna Tartt primește, pentru The Goldfinch, premiul Pulitzer. Devine astfel, la distanță de 16 ani, urmașa lui Philip Roth, care primise premiul pentru Pastorala americană (un roman ceva mai scurt, totuși). Gloriile se succedă: Times o include în lista femeilor celor mai influente din univers. Este fără îndoială un fenomen. Sticletele are de toate: un copil de 13 ani (Theodore „Theo"" Decker) care își pierde mama într-un atentat terorist, pe cînd vizitau Metropolitan Museum of Art. Un tată dipsoman, care își risipește banii la jocuri de noroc, în Las Vegas, și moare într-un accident de mașină. O prietenie cu un băiat, Boris, ai cărui părinți au emigrat tocmai din Ucraina. Droguri. Un protector sub figura unui bătrîn anticar înțelept (James „Hobie"" Hobart). Un salt în timp de 8 ani. O afacere cu falsuri pentru a-l salva de la faliment pe bunul Hobie. Dificultăți legate de tabloul pe care îl sustrăsese după explozie din muzeul în care se afla cu mama lui (e vorba chiar de „Goldfinch”). Traficanți veroși de opere de artă. Împușcături în noapte. O iubire neîmplinită pentru o fată (Pippa) care ezită să-și dăruiască inima unui ins dubios ca Theo, consumator îndîrjit de droguri. Revenirea tabloului lui Carel Fabritius în Muzeul de origine. Meditații despre sensul vieții și al morții... Nu-mi rămîne decît să citez cîteva fraze și să vă las să meditați asupra lor:● „Mama căzu peste mine şi mă apucă de braţ; am simţit-o jilavă şi palidă ca un peşte de baltă”. ● „[mama] avea înfăţişarea uşor şifonată a unei păsări marine abătute din drum de curenţi”.● „[tot mama] radia o lumină fermecată, ca de teatru, încît a vedea lucrurile prin ochii ei însemna a le vedea în culori mai vii decât în mod normal”.● „Ea păru surprinsă, ca şi cum ar fi uitat că mă aflam acolo. Haina albă, fluturând în vânt, îi sublinia silueta de ibis cu picioare lungi, parcă gata să-şi desfacă aripile şi să se ridice plutind deasupra parcului”.● Am păstrat pentru final acest glonte filosofic optimist și-l îndrept spre capetele voastre, dragi cititori: „Fate is cruel but maybe not random.

33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian,Rating 3 out of 5,"Only a reader not familiar with Dickens, especially ""Great Expectations,"" will find the book amusing, even good.But while the conventions are indeed laudable, I cannot help but find the ultra-cool character of Boris (an avatar of Dickens' Fagan); the tale of two cities revamped into a dull threesome of perhaps the three most exciting cities--NYC, Vegas, Amsterdam; the teenage dawdling akin to Oliver Twist's-- they are, ultimately, safe & unoriginal. Where's the innovation, 2014's Oracle? This is a marble cake novel (the parts are extremely long, but, yes, contrasting enough to be, well, readable), & something a tad... unspecial. In the grand recipe of Pulitzer recipients, the paint-it-by-numbers kind, it doesn't take a genius to understand that key ingredients MUST exist in the beloved monster. Take incidents of terrorism (""American Pastoral""), incidents with goons of the underworld (alas, not ""Goon Squad"", but most definitely ""Humboldt's Gift"") & an overlong, overcooked, just preposterous ending (""Rabbit at Rest"")--meditations on art, life, etc. etc. Gag. Gag. Gag.To keep it concise (a mercy sadly not granted to the reader of the latest Donna Tartt): It's a must to the Canon-&-Literary-Prize aficionado, and will be lauded as ""great."" But know, dear reader, that all the hype remains bafflingly undeserved."
34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’m told that mine is the deciding vote to establish this book’s place in history: masterpiece or meh. Well, I’ve given myself a week to think about it, and the fact that I did think about it skews it to the positive. But then the equivocator in me recognizes that controversial books often have strong pluses and minuses to consider. Here are the factors as I see them.A compelling plot. Plenty happens to make this more than just navel fixation. Thirteen-year-old New York City kid, Theo, had one good parent (a mom who genuinely cared for him) and one bad one (a booze hound who had abandoned them). Then, soon after Theo’s mom described what was special to her about the goldfinch painting they were looking at, a bomb went off in the museum and he lost his good one. Dazed, and before he learned of his mother’s fate, he heard the dying wishes of an antique dealer who had been there with his niece Pippa. Theo’s original optimism that he and his mom would soon be reunited gave way to the agonizing truth, and he had to scramble to avoid foster care. He ended up in the posh digs of a nerdy friend from school who had been a co-target of bullying earlier when they both skipped a grade. Theo was still reeling from his loss, but did manage to deliver an heirloom to the shop where the antique dealer had told him to go. There he met one of the kindest characters in all of litdom, a much needed ally named Hobie, along with Pippa who was recovering from the museum trauma. My rule in reviews is not to reveal more about the plot than what the inside flap does, so the only thing I’ll add is that Theo soon finds himself on the outskirts of Las Vegas, the object of indifferent (at best) child care, but able to survive when he teams up with a fellow hard luck case named Boris who could swear in multiple Eastern European languages and was wise to the ways of the world. Like any pulsating storyline, this one keeps the pages turning. (+)As bleak as any house Dickens could conjure. I googled “Tartt Goldfinch Dickensian” and came up with 62,300 hits. So yes, people have noticed the hardship. In and of itself, the gloom could be a (+) or a (-), but it tipped negative for me when the conflict, at times, felt contrived. And it was relentless. I was hoping the law of averages would give poor Theo a break every once in a while. To be fair I should mention that my misery tolerance may be compromised by the weather we’ve been having. (-) Poor decisions. The problem for me was not in Theo’s choices per se, but how inconsistent they sometimes seemed given his intellect, character and street smarts. At the same time, I have to remember how young he was when made many of them, and how leery a virtual orphan is apt to be to trust anyone in a position to help. (+/-) Resonating themes. Beauty, love, good vs. evil – as a big sprawling book, this one took its time and developed its notions well. I give extra credit, too, for the natural way philosophical conversations grew out of the story. When Hobie opined about what constitutes beauty and what its role is in our lives, his thoughts are backed by the long hours he spent restoring antique furniture. And when Boris talks about situational ethics, it’s with an insightful and accessible perspective from his own sordid past and from all the Dostoevsky he’s read. There were even moments of profundity that no doubt earn it literary plaudits. (+)Art appreciation. The Fabritius painting titled the same as the book is, not surprisingly, central to the story. It was analyzed and praised, its history was explained in detail, and Theo, as he narrated, recognized it as a metaphor, citing the small bird’s bravery to keep plugging away despite being chained to his perch. In fact, throughout the book there is a heightened artistic sensitivity. Theo went into the antiques business with a good eye for aesthetics. He also learned more than he might have liked about the art underworld. (+)Emotional honesty. Theo had issues, but he came by them in a plausible and understandable way. I felt way more empathy than antipathy for him. One of the harder things he had to deal with was a rather nasty pill habit. Given his heredity, his influences (primarily Boris) and the harshness of his early life, we don’t judge so much as relate. The book was also credible about the feelings Theo had for Pippa, whom he had idealized from a young age. (+)How many more pages anyway? It is long. And dense, too. That said, I was not so much bored as just ready to move on. Other books I got for Christmas were burning holes through the shelf. (-)Damn good writing. I guess in a way I’ve buried the lead: Donna Tartt writes really well. I heard she took a full decade to put this together, and it shows. The prose is crisp and refined; the research was first-rate; and her characters, even the minor ones, are nuanced and memorable. As a very small quibble, I sometimes felt like she would choose a slightly wrong word for a male narrator to use, but that was an increasingly rare feeling the more she drew me in to the story. The descriptions were the kind you wonder, thinking back, how such sharp pictures are etched in your mind when you never noticed any long passages that would have given them to you. I got that feeling several times, most noticeably when she described the antique shop where Hobie lived, the shell of a home in suburban Vegas, and the otherworldliness of Amsterdam (or at least of its underbelly). (+)Weighing the pluses and minuses puts this at a solid 4 stars for me. Despite wishing I could have finished it faster, the characters and great writing are likely to be the memories that last."

This critically acclaimed third masterwork from Tartt is vast enough in scope to be considered a saga in my opinion, looking at human suffering, struggle, loss and destiny, and very beautifully... the power of both, art and human bonding. Yet another great work with near perfect prose, style and tone. And as for the opening scene, it's one you'll never forget - it will blow your mind! Tartt seems unable to do any wrong when, or however she puts ink on paper! 9 out 12. and that's being extremely conservative.The momentous event at the start of this read, forever changed the life of Theo Decker at aged 13, and this masterclass tells his story as a directionless and essentially traumatised boy growing up in New York with a substitute family of sorts and how a painting 'The Goldfinch' plays a leading role in his early and young adult life. The genius, in my opinion, of this work has two main points; (1.) this is a read with a number of brain shattering all-consuming highs that are integral to the book making it un-put-downable... yet somehow there are equally as many subtle low-level reveals or supposedly minor incidents that are just as momentous and also make the book un-put-downable! (2.) on not one single occasion was I able to guess what was going to happen next, it was so refreshing to read a seemingly truly original story where the story had a life of it's own, so unpredictable yet so real, at at times unsettling.This was also my first ever 'book club' read... what a fabulous entry into the world of book clubs for me!2015 read"
39,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"The first 600 pages of this book are a gripping read. Tartt creates sympathetic protagonists that you want to root for and fast-paced adventures and predicaments in which you want to see them succeed.Tartt owes a great debt to Dickens in the story's plot, characters, and pathos. Theo Decker is shockingly and suddenly orphaned one ordinary day after a bomb rips through the Metropolitan Museum and his mother perishes while admiring her favorite paintings. Of course, she was beautiful, smart, and possessed of a heart of gold. His father, on the other hand, is a charming con artist who has abandoned them to live with another woman in Las Vegas. Theo has high and low adventures (hopscotching from a tony apartment on the Upper East Side with the blue-blooded Barbours to a seedy desert neighborhood in Las Vegas after his father shows up to reclaim him). Tartt is adept at creating vivid scenes and landscapes (her descriptions of Las Vegas' arid beauty are gorgeous), but she has a tendency to fall back on familiar (and sometimes, cliched) stereotypes. Of course, the Barbours are troubled in that particularly WASP-y, repressed way. Of course, his new Russian pal, Boris, reads Dostoevsky and cynically pontificates on life and politics while waving his arms about and drinking vodka. And of course, his eventual savior and guardian, Hobie, comes with an alluring ward who will forever haunt him and claim his love, a la Estella in Great Expectations.I really enjoyed the first 600 pages of the novel. I thought Tartt revealed a lot about modern America and what it means to be successful (or striving) in America today as she unfurled the brisk plot. However, the last 100-150 pages, with its metaphysical and existential pontificating, did little to advance the plot and ultimately caused me to become less invested in the book and its characters. That is unfortunate, since I was rooting for Theo, Boris, and Pippa right up until the very end."

Best of all is Boris... just superb. I'm missing him badly.If you've never tried audio books I'd recommend you start here, with this book.

Something that seems to happen more and more frequently lately. But watch out, here comes the knee:There's five hours of my life I'll never get back. God in heaven, can we spell overwritten? Along about page 400 I conducted an experiment--could I read a sentence a page and still understand what was going on? Yes, I could. If ever a book needed an editor with a red pencil, this book was it. If ever an author needed a remedial course in Strunk and White, Tartt is her.

There are also waaaaay too many on-the-nose observations, especially at the endAnd I keep thinking too of the more conventional wisdom: namely, that the pursuit of pure beauty is a trap, a fast track to bitterness and sorrow, that beauty has to be wedded to something more meaningful.""Hard to put things right. You don't often get that chance. Sometimes all you can do is not get caught.""Obvious much? What worries me most is that because it won the Pulitzer, it's now going to be forced on millions of high school students in lit classes, who will conclude that if The Goldfinch is what is considered good writing, they'll pass, thanks.

There is a lot to admire about the novel as the writing is excellent and the characters are very well drawn and the sense of time and place is excellent. The first 100 pages were extremely well written and I was really engrossed with the story but then it just dragged on and on for me from there. I probably would have loved this novel if it was about two/three hundred pages shorter. I really disliked constant reference to drugs in the story and I understand they belonged in the book but I got fed up of long descriptions of drug taking and types of drugs throughout the story. I was actually disappointed with how little the story was about the painting in the end. The book fell down for me on the plot, just too many pages and not enough drama.I know others have loved this book but this review is only my opinion and I would advise reading some of the 4/5 star reviews before deciding."

The story appeared to be very interesting about Theo Decker, who has loved and lost, who enters the criminal underworld, an individual who finally makes a marvellous discovery in life and then, of course, there is his talisman, the painting of “The Goldfinch"". I also love Goldfinches and often photograph them in the garden if I can be in the right place with the camera at the right time.It’s a beautifully published book and I also was taken with the additional touch of the photo of “The Goldfinch” which is loosely tacked onto the frontispiece. The glowing reviews assured me that it was a 2013 literary masterpiece. It’s very well written too. So where did it all go wrong, well for me anyway?Perhaps the contradictory comment by Albert Camus before Chapter one says it all?The absurd does not liberate; it binds.I felt oddly cynical about the first sentence of the book as similar words are so often used at the beginning in novels:While I was still in Amsterdam, I dreamed about my mother for the first time in years.I automatically thought about “Rebecca” for some obscure reason.It’s sad hearing about Theo losing his mother in tragic circumstances and to think that he admits after so many years he’s never met anyone who made him feel loved in the way she did. I always like reading about New York but still I couldn’t get into the story. I don’t know why and then I started to skim read looking for that magical literary work I was sure was there. But it wasn’t there. Individuals such as Goldie, Boris and Xandra floated by…as if in a dream.There were some magical sections such as the following, and the referrals to love, but still not enough to entice me:And as much as I’d like to believe there’s truth beyond illusion, I’ve come to believe that there’s no truth beyond illusion. Because, between ‘reality’ on the one hand, and the point where the mind strikes reality, there’s a middle zone, a rainbow edge where beauty comes into being, where two different surfaces mingle and blur to provide what life does not: and this is the space where all art exists, and all magic.I have such a sense of regret here. Perhaps this book is not right for me at this period in time. Perhaps personal reasons have subconsciously entered into the equation.I will place it next to my beloved “The Alexandria Quartet” on the bookshelf to remind me of it and I may read it in the future."

A Beautiful, Stellar Novel
“It is with the reading of books the same as with looking at pictures; one must, without doubt, without hesitations, with assurance, admire what is beautiful.” ― Vincent van GoghDonna Tartt shatters the world of an impressionable kid then shakes: forcing him to live with a ne'er do well dad, giving him a most memorable pal (one of the best drawn supporting characters in recent memory), an unrequited love, an adopted family, the symbolic Dutch painting of the chained ""Goldfinch,"" and creating significant roles in the polar opposites of the burgeoning and boisterous NYC and the desolate, belly-busted subdivision developments outside Las Vegas; and, finally, sending our hero on a suspenseful quasi-odyssey to Holland.

""Dickensian,"" said NPR, ""Dickensian,"" said the New York Times, as if two orphans and an olde curiosity shoppe plus swarthier ne'er-do-well orphan who appears in 2nd book/act, reappears in 4th book/act equals Dickens. Like calling that baton you buy in the grocery store a baguette. While it has certainly been a page turner there are still so many things that are irksome.1. The 13 year-old Theo Decker has the emotional maturity of an 8 or 9 year old. Same goes for his friend Andy van der Woodsen, I mean Barbour. For two upper East Side private school boys they seem shockingly stunted. And, my god, don't they have internet up there? Who uses the phone book? How did that child ever get into MIT?2. Both Pippa (Pip, Middleton, what have you)and Kitsey Barbour are the bifurcated versions of Camilla Macauley (see Tartt, Secret History): same trailer, different park. 3. The grown-up version of Theo is too much like the first-season Gossip Girl Dan Humphrey. Part Greenwich Village Idiot, part inside-outsider with his nose pressed up against the glass. 4. What's with all of the 6'5"" literary guardian angels whose names start with H: Hagrid, Hodor, and now Hobie. 5. By the end of the novel, it becomes a nightmarish mash-up of (more) Gossip Girl meets Quentin Tarrantino. Except that there are no black people. 6. Is it still possible to get high from sniffing glue? I thought that ended in 1972. Evidently not.7. The word ""fractal"" should not be used in a novel twice. Even if the novel runs 770 pages.8.

49,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29931457-franco-santos,Rating 5 out of 5,"Hacía mucho rato que le tenía ganas a este libro, ganador del Pulitzer en el 2014 y con cuantiosas críticas desbordantes de adoración. Cada vez que entraba alguna librería y recorría mi vista por las estanterías me encontraba con lomos de colores, que gritaban ¡mirame, mirame, mirame!, con los nombres en letras grandes de sus respectivos autores para ubicarlos con facilidad. Pero siempre, y no había excepción, me topaba con un rectángulo blanco que resaltaba por sobre todos los demás, y siempre, también sin excepción, lo sacaba para hojearlo y admirar, so fetichista, sus dimensiones. Sin embargo, a pesar de que me llamaba poderosísimamente la atención, nunca lo compraba. Yo ya conocía a la autora, y por supuesto al libro en cuestión; ya tenía leído un libro de Tartt (El secreto), y me había maravillado, en especial por su escritura tan limpia pero cargada de emoción; no obstante, me ponía excusas para no comprarlo, ya fuera por su extensión, ya fuera por su precio o ya fuera porque tenía otros libros a los que le daba más prioridad.Pero aquí estoy. Como ven, finalmente tuve el ¿valor? de comprarlo. Aquí estoy sin saber qué pensar de lo que me ha dejado y lo que ha hecho de mí este libro. Dos días y medio me bastaron para acabarlo de lo adictivo, mordaz y emocionante que fue esta aventura. Y sí, sinceramente no tengo ni la más mínima idea de lo que decir. Es un libro extraño, con muchas páginas y sin mucha historia que contar. Aburrido. Tedioso. Excesivamente descriptivo. Con páginas y más páginas usadas para no contar nada. Pero también existe algo, entre tanta paja, que hizo que siguiera leyendo, y con sólida adicción, dependiente de un relato que no lograba interesarme del todo pero que de alguna manera que sobrepasa mis capacidades de comprensión me había atrapado. Podría decir que me encantó el inicio, como también podría decir que la odié, o podría decir que la parte de Las Vegas fue insulsa y redundante, como asimismo decir que fue esencial. El final no me gustó, muy de película de acción, irreal, pidiendo a gritos ser Best-seller, pero también me gustó. No tiene sentido. No obstante hay algo...Como Theodore, quizá tengo que escribir para hallarle el sentido, quizá no. El jilguero aborda el tema de la belleza en el arte y la contemplación profana del ojo humano, algo que también es tratado en El secreto. Y creo que eso es lo esencial del libro. El jilguero empieza con una explosión en el Metropolitan Museum of Art en Nueva York, que se cobra la vida de la madre del protagonista, Theodore Decker, también presente pero resultado ileso. Este, entre tanta consternación, se roba un cuadro, el famoso Jilguero de Fabritius. A partir de allí se le da inicio a una Novela, sí, con mayúscula, que despliega las maestras habilidades narrativas de Donna Tartt. A partir de allí se le da inicio a un Coming of Age dickensiano que girará en torno a las desgracias y errores de Theo, desde su infancia hasta ya entrado en el mundo adulto, acompañado de una familia sustituta fría y distante, de un padre alcohólico, ludópata e irresponsable, de un amigo que le abrirá las puertas a los estupefacientes y a la delincuencia, de un amor no correspondido y de un tutor bondadoso. Pero lo que siempre está presente detrás de tanta desgracia e infortunio y soledad es el cuadro robado, El jilguero, admirado con pasión y cuidado irrefrenable por Theo. El cuadro es como la piedra angular de las más de mil páginas de este libro. En torno a la pintura orbita todo lo que sucede en la vida de Theodore, como una condena que lo encadena y un escape de sus calamidades personales.Y en eso mismo quiero poner un freno, y para mí este es el sentido del libro. El arte como un dios físico, como una idea materializada que debemos contemplar con el alma y no con el ojo. La obsesión de Theo por el cuadro es mucho más que una admiración meramente artística, como también es más que un enlace con su madre fallecida. Es una ventana por la cual mirar un futuro más dichoso, una evasión al desastre. Es la verdadera fuente de la eternidad, que liga a la fragilidad del ser humano con algo celestial. Esto es lo que, en mi opinión, propone Tartt: el arte como el único camino hacia lo sublime. Siguiendo esta lógica, tal vez la autodestrucción de Theo no sea otra cosa que un intento de poner a prueba la magia del arte y de la belleza, de asegurarse de que frente a la debilidad de su cuerpo y mente, siempre iba a tener su acceso, cuando quisiera, a la divinidad del arte.Es imposible ignorar el trayecto hacia la maduración personal de Theo, una maduración desenfrenada y salvaje. Theo fue despojado de su infancia y arrojado a un mundo de adultez prematura. A la deriva se adueñaba de cualquier camino que lo pudiera llevar a la independencia, mentalizado en no tener nada que perder ni por lo que vivir más que por la autosuficiencia. Cuando Theo se encuentra con Boris, la oportunidad de madurar por sí mismo se le fue presentada. La amistad entre Theo (""Potter"") y Boris es una prueba del vínculo independiente que tanto perseguía Theo, no un cariño parental, dependiente o profundo, sino una relación que lo ayudase a despegarse de lo que ya no tenía más, puesto que no había nadie que lo guiara como solo su madre podría hacerlo. Y aquí surge la influencia, la inmoralidad, la honestidad brutal de Boris y la inocencia siendo lentamente erosionada de Theo, que presenta un quiebre (lamentablemente para mal) de nuestro protagonista. Fue una suerte la aparición de Boris. Si no hubiese sido por este personaje el libro se hubiese desintegrado en la nada absoluta antes de la página 500. Boris es uno de los mejores personajes secundarios con lo que me he encontrado, y aun así ni siquiera me caía del todo bien. Esto es lo raro de El jilguero: encanta y aborrece en simultáneo. Por supuesto que esta novela tiene errores, o los que al menos yo considero errores o puntos flojos. Por ejemplo, la excesiva cantidad de coincidencias (no me pude creer la facilidad con la que Theo se encontraba con gente conocida en una ciudad tan habitada y grande como Nueva York), decisiones que ponían en evidencia a la escritora detrás de la historia de lo forzadas que eran, diálogos eternos que no llevaban a nada, Tartt tocando sus propias campanas en esas últimas páginas masturbatorias, etcétera. (Y estoy perdonando las discusiones de arte interminables porque se relacionan indirectamente con el lado filosófico del libro, como asimismo la pésima traducción, plagada de erratas infantiles). Sin embargo esto de alguna manera revitaliza la idea de que El jilguero es más que sus flaquezas y sus aciertos. Sé desde ya que me costará despegarme de este relato que no me maravilló del todo y aun así estoy escribiendo maravillas sobre él.Nihilismo descontrolado, soledad, excesos, engaños, corazones rotos y pérdidas arbitrarias, pero también bondad, amor, lealtad, amistad, culpa y arrepentimiento. Tartt enseña que desde la simpleza se puede hacer grandes construcciones literarias. La historia es poca, pero logra llegar a su cometido, que es conmover al lector. Tartt ha logrado interpelarme desde un argumento simple pero poderoso. El jilguero es una mirada pesimista y aun así esperanzadora de la naturaleza humana. Un recorrido filosófico por la vida de un personaje no del todo atractivo pero que con la habilidad de Tartt con las palabras atrapará a cualquier amante de la buena literatura. Tartt trata, desde un lado profundamente humano y cruel, la libertad de acciones y qué es lo que nos hace ser quienes somos, en nuestros errores y nuestros desperfectos y nuestra lucha incesante por conocer por qué seguimos viviendo."

I listened to the audio in double time and I am glad I did as I am not sure I would have stayed interested in this the whole time. There were slow parts that I think would have been boring if I wouldn't have been able to let them fly by on my commute. That being said, this story probably could have been told in 400 pages, but the author really fleshed it out, told extra anecdotes, focused on detail, stressed existential introspection of the main character. In the end, all these things came together for a pretty amazing experience. I give this 4 stars simply because I am amazed of the detail the author put into it - it is a work of art. The removal of the one star was because sometimes it was just a bit too much!"

53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline,Rating 4 out of 5,"""Caring too much for objects can destroy you. Only - if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn't it? And isn't the whole point of things - beautiful things - that they connect you to some larger beauty? Those first images that crack your heart wide open and you spend the rest of your life chasing, or trying to recapture, in one way or another? ...You see one painting, I see another, the art book puts it at another remove still, the lady buying the greeting card at the museum gift shop sees something else entire, and that's not even to mention the people separated from us by time - four hundred years before us, four hundred years after we're gone - it'll never strike anybody in the same way and the great majority of people it'll never strike in any deep way at all but - a really great painting is fluid enough to work its way into the mind and heart through all kinds of different angles, in ways that are unique and very particular. Yours, yours. I was painted for you.""While reading The Goldfinch, I kept thinking about that old Psych 101 question: You're in an art museum when a fire breaks out. In the room with you is an old woman, and a priceless Rembrandt. You can only save one. Which do you choose?This is the best way I can think of to describe the characters in Donna Tartt's books: they would all, without hesitation, choose to save the painting. This doesn't mean that they're evil, or even particularly bad. They just have different priorities, and a love of beautiful things that often blinds them and causes havoc in their lives. (I'm including the characters of The Secret History in that description, because the themes and characters in this book are so similar that it functions almost as an unofficial sequel - Tartt's middle book, The Little Friend, is the strange, possibly-illegitimate cousin who no one really likes and will therefore not be invited to this party)This book begins with what is essentially a real-life scenario of the question I posed above. One afternoon, thirteen-year-old Theo Decker is with his mother in an art museum, at a Dutch Masters exhibit. There is a bombing, which Theo barely survives, and when he is trying to get out of the ruined gallery he comes across an old man. The man, dying and disoriented, thinks that Theo is someone else and gives him his ring and says, ""Hobart and Blackwell. Ring the green bell."" Theo leaves the museum with two new possessions: the ring, and a small painting by Carel Fabritius called The Goldfinch.Theo eventually tracks down the antique shop and becomes friends with Hobart (Hobie) a furniture restorer. But before we can get too invested in this, real life intrudes: Theo's mother died in the bombing, and Theo's only living relative is his deadbeat, gambling-addicted father, who shows up out of nowhere and brings Theo to live with him in Las Vegas. Theo spends several years living in a situation that is, frankly, Dickensian as fuck. It also drags on a lot longer than I thought it needed to, but the section establishes two important things: first, Theo is a lot more like his father than he likes to admit; and two, he makes a friend named Boris, a petty criminal who will become very important later.Eventually Theo makes it back to New York, and throughout all of this, the painting goes with him. It becomes more than a painting: it becomes an object of comfort, a memory of his mother, and a vital part of his life.""The painting had made me feel less moral, less ordinary. It was support and vindication; it was sustenance and sum. It was the keystone that had held the whole cathedral up...all my adult life, I'd been privately sustained by that great, hidden, savage joy: the conviction that my whole life was balanced atop a secret that might at any moment blow apart.""(I wasn't joking about this being an almost-sequel to The Secret History - that last sentence could have easily been spoken by Richard Papen)I'll be honest: the best part of the plot (when someone begins to suspect that Theo was the person who stole the painting) takes way, way too long to get started, and the whole thing blows up so quickly that we almost don't have time to catch our breath. But I didn't mind, because lest we forget, this is Donna Tartt's first book in ten years, so even when the plot dragged, I was still enjoying the feeling of being immersed in her world of corrupt heroes and savage beauty. Those who haven't read The Secret History may find themselves a little adrift in this world where all the characters would choose to save a painting and let a person die instead. Those who found The Secret History melodramatic or contrived or ridiculous can fuck right off will find nothing here that interests them. They can go sit somewhere else; I'll be over here at Tartt's table with the damaged, emotionally-unavailable borderline-sociopaths, talking about art. Over here, everything is beautiful and everything hurts, and that's the way we like it.""Whenever you see flies or insects in a still life - a wilted petal, a black spot on the apple - the painter is giving you a secret message. He's telling you that living things don't last - it's all temporary. Death in life. That's why they're called natures mortes. Maybe you don't see it at first with all the beauty and bloom, the little speck of rot. But if you look closer - there it is."""

I mean the writing itself was by any definition phenomenal. I just couldn't get into the story, and I have no idea why. I have no clue why so much was happening (I mean there was a fricking terrorist attack) and I was still so bored. It was just Holden Caufield^n if n=infinity. Like Theo just didn't change. Well--spoilers below....He changed after his mom died obviously but that was early in the book. From there the rest of the book was just angst. So much angst. So much pining, so much self-loathing and so much angst. Again, it's not like this wasn't unjustified, but it was a long book, and a lot of angst. It didn't make the stakes feel any higher, it just made me dislike Theo. I don't mind disliking the protagonist, but there was just nothing to latch on to. I mean he was a pretty reactive protagonist in the end (especially during the climax). Like he killed Martin, sure, but he didn't steal the painting back, or set up the job. He just got carried around by Boris, shoved in the right place at the right time, then yeah he shot a guy at the end to give him some action but after that it was back to the angst. I was disappointed by how unimportant Las Vegas turned out to be. I mean all it did was send Theo on a life of drugs and all the important things to happen in Vegas happened to Boris after Theo left so we didn't even see it. All we saw was drug use, angst, and how pathetic his father was. I don't know. I'm talking in circles now. There's no doubt Donna Tartt can write circles around any of her contemporaries but I just struggled to get into this book."
59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles,Rating 5 out of 5,"Clear off the biggest wall in the gallery of novels about beloved paintings. You’ll need lots of space for “The Goldfinch,” Donna Tartt’s giant new masterpiece about a small masterpiece by Carel Fabritius. Don’t worry if you can’t recall that name from a dark and somnolent art-history classroom. Though he was a celebrated student of Rembrandt, the Dutch painter was almost blasted into obscurity by a gunpowder explosion in 1654, a fatal accident that made his few extant paintings even rarer than Vermeer’s. But Tartt’s novel is no delicate study of a girl with a pearl earring. She places Fabritius’s tiny bird at the center of a capacious story that soars across the United States and around the planet, lighting on themes of beauty, family and destiny.Tartt’s many fans have waited with great expectations since her previous book, “The Little Friend,” was published in 2002. While the world has been transformed over the past decade, one of the most remarkable qualities of “The Goldfinch” is that it arrives singed with 9/11 terror but redolent of a 19th-century novel. Indeed, Charles Dickens floats through these pages like Marley’s ghost. You can hear the great master in everything from the endlessly propulsive plot to the description of a minor character with a “cleft chin, doughball nose, tense slit of a mouth, all bunched tight in the center of a face which glowed a plump, inflamed, blood-pressure pink.”There’s nothing slavish, though, about Tartt’s allusions to Dickens. She’s not writing an extension of “Great Expectations” such as Peter Carey’s marvelous “Jack Maggs.” Still, anyone who’s run through the streets of London with Pip and Estella will catch glimpses of those characters and others in “The Goldfinch.” And even if Tartt can’t write with Dickens’s speed, she knows how to create the same kind of intimate voice, laced with her own brand of mordant comedy and sorrow that makes us willing captives.Although it opens on a Christmas Day, amid the festivities of the season, the story is framed by grief. Theo Decker is rotting in a hotel room in Amsterdam, sweaty with fever and narcotics, afraid to leave or even call for help. His only solace is a brief dream visit from his beloved mother, who died 14 years ago, when he was a mischievous eighth-grader.“Things would have turned out better if she had lived,” Theo begins, and immediately we’re swept back to that calamitous spring day in New York when he and his mom darted into the Metropolitan Museum. Just moments after she explains the composition of Rembrandt’s unnerving “Anatomy Lesson,” Theo finds himself lying amid dozens of bodies flayed by a terrorist’s bomb. In the chaos of flesh and rubble, Theo comforts a dying old man and then stumbles out of the smoldering museum clutching Fabritius’s “The Goldfinch,” his mother’s favorite painting —saved from the flames of fate once again.With its bloody ironies and nested coincidences, this explosive opening scene is awash with the concussive disorientation of the moment but also polished by years of regret. Amid the smoke and sirens, Theo is “gasping, half-choked with plaster dust,” already tormented by the illusion of culpability, by the endlessly rehearsed accusation that he could have placed his mother and himself somewhere else — anywhere else — that day. This is, among many other things, a novel of survivor’s guilt, of living in “the generalized miasma of shame and unworthiness and being-a-burden.”With a Dutch master’s attention to detail, Tartt has created a narrative voice that is simultaneously immediate and retrospective, filled with the boy’s adolescent anxieties and the man’s fermented despair. “How was it possible to miss someone as much as I missed my mother?” Theo says. “Sometimes, unexpectedly, grief pounded over me in waves that left me gasping; and when the waves washed back, I found myself looking out over a brackish wreck which was illuminated in a light so lucid, so heartsick and empty, that I could hardly remember that the world had ever been anything but dead.”While grief may be the novel’s bassline, Theo’s wit and intelligence provide the book’s endearing melody. Orphaned by the Met bombing, he and that stolen painting drift from one temporary family to another, all of them composed of vibrant characters that he turns over in his mind like a connoisseur of human personality. “How had I fetched up into this strange new life?” Theo wonders, as a series of elaborately developed episodes shows off the range of Tartt’s skill. In Manhattan, she conjures up a brittle Park Avenue clan with all its unconscious privilege and gold-plated dysfunction. In Las Vegas, she’s just as attentive to the tragicomedy of a gambler and his floozy girlfriend riding to ruin on inebriated fantasies of easy money.The novel reaches its greatest luster in an antique store that Theo finds by following the mysterious instructions of that dying old man in the Met. It’s a magical place “where every clock in the house said something different and time didn’t actually correspond to the standard measure but instead meandered along at its own sedate tick-tock, obeying the pace of his antique-crowded backwater, far from the factory-built, epoxy-glued version of the world.” There, under the tutelage of an absent-minded restorer, Theo enjoys a bit of restoration himself. His appreciation for beautiful old things is refined and nurtured — along with his indelible love for a wounded young woman who lives among the antiques.Tartt has created a rare treasure: a long novel that never feels long, a book worthy of our winter hibernation by the fire. In fact, toward page 500, a couple of hundred pages after most novelists would have packed up their sentences and closed the covers, she recharges the plot by introducing another complex strain of intrigue involving international gangsters. And so, at the very moment when you fear it might stall, “The Goldfinch” takes flight again.But the Victorian tenor of this thoroughly modern novel isn’t reflected only in its extended plot and vast collection of memorable characters. You can also feel that 19th-century spirit in the author’s willingness to take advantage of her enormous canvas to reflect self-consciously on moral and aesthetic concerns that so many contemporary fiction writers are too timid or too sophisticated to address directly. Free will and fate, pragmatic morality and absolute values, an authentic life and a dutiful one — those fusty old terms spring to life in an extended passage of philosophical trompe l’oeil as Theo expounds with the authority of a man who has suffered, who knows why the chained bird sings. Through years of guilt and drug-dulled pain, experience has taught him that loving something sublime can soothe “the writhing loneliness of life.” The novel ends in full-throated praise for the power of a great painting to sink into your soul, to act as a bulwark against the inevitable victory of death.Look here: A great novel can do that, too."

I planned on reading it after The Secret History but didn't pull the trigger until it went on sale for $1.99.This is one of those books I have conflicting feelings over. It's a literary novel and is a fine example of everything that entails, both the things I like and the things I don't. Donna Tartt's writing is as wonderful as ever. She's got a knack for stringing words together, painting vivid images. The various locals all seemed very real: New York, Las Vegas, Amsterdam.Little bits of philosophy were scattered throughout the text, musings on life, the universe, and everything. Theo goes from one fuck-up to the next, not really imagining any consequences down the line, and things go pretty well for him. Until they don't.While I think The Goldfinch was beautifully written and very readable, I didn't give a rat's ass about any of the characters other than Boris. Boris was the only one I felt had any real substance. The rest were caricatures, for the most part. Theo didn't show a lot in the way of personality and seemed like a collection of traits more than a character. Like a lot of modern lit, the book felt like it was trying too hard to be profound at times and wasn't terribly concerned with telling a story. This thing is a whopper at 771 pages and the story could have easily been told, flourishes and all, in half of that. I did like the twists when they happened but it was kind of like seeing a billboard along a stretch of I-70 in the middle of Kansas, something to break up the endless journey.Near the end, Amanda asked me if I was enjoying it. Enjoy wasn't the word I would use. I'm glad I experienced the book and there were parts I liked quite a bit, most featuring Boris, but there was never a time I wished the book would never end.In conclusion, I will probably never be on the board that awards the Pulitzer Prize. The Goldfinch is some fantastic writing but not a hell of a lot in the way of a story. Glad I read it, gladder still that it's over. Three out of five stars."

So many things I loved about this book - the artsy aspect to it, the mystery, the truly flawed characters that I cared so much about, the big life questions that we all ponder... I finished this book months ago and still think about it.I've heard this described as a YA novel but don't understand that, other than I suppose it could be considered a coming of age novel - but so many regular adult fiction books could be classified that way too. I found it complex, rich, yet very accessible. Beautifully written, in such a simple and nonjudgmental voice. It's super long, but that just provides more time to enjoy the story.

63,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus,Rating 4 out of 5,"Rating: 4* of fiveThe Publisher Says: It begins with a boy. Theo Decker, a thirteen-year-old New Yorker, miraculously survives an accident that kills his mother. Abandoned by his father, Theo is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. Bewildered by his strange new home on Park Avenue, disturbed by schoolmates who don't know how to talk to him, and tormented above all by his unbearable longing for his mother, he clings to one thing that reminds him of her: a small, mysteriously captivating painting that ultimately draws Theo into the underworld of art.As an adult, Theo moves silkily between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty labyrinth of an antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love-and at the center of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle.The Goldfinch is a novel of shocking narrative energy and power. It combines unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and breathtaking suspense, while plumbing with a philosopher's calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity, and art. It is a beautiful, stay-up-all-night and tell-all-your-friends triumph, an old-fashioned story of loss and obsession, survival and self-invention, and the ruthless machinations of fate.My Review: The Doubleday UK meme, a book a day for July 2014, is the goad I'm using to get through my snit-based unwritten reviews. Today's prompt is to identify the book one would take to a desert island.It was between this book and The Luminaries, a more artistically successful and more culturally enriching book; a book with grace and beauty and charm; a rich feast that says things to me even yet, months after reading it.I chose this book.I look at the blanked-out faces of the other passengers--hoisting their briefcases, their backpacks, shuffling to disembark--and I think of what Hobie said: beauty alters the grain of reality. And I keep thinking too of the more conventional wisdom: namely, that the pursuit of pure beauty is a trap, a fast track to bitterness and sorrow, that beauty has to be wedded to something more meaningful.Only what is that thing? Why am I made the way I am? Why do I care about all the wrong things, and nothing at all for the right ones? Or, to tip it another way: how can I see so clearly that everything I love or care about is illusion, and yet--for me, anyway--all that's worth living for lies in that charm?A great sorrow, and one that I am only beginning to understand: we don't get to choose our own hearts. We can't make ourselves want what's good for us or what's good for other people. We don't get to choose the people we are.It's not Art, but it's a good, solid, real moment. I bought into Theo, I cared about the dumbass, I found him the kind of kid I'd try to fix and straighten out so he wouldn't flounder so messily as he looked for the path through the thicket.Then there's traife like this: ""'When you feel homesick,' he said, ‘just look up. Because the moon is the same wherever you go.'” Gag me. That's so Disney-movie pseudoprofound I could unswallow all over the book.But then...Whatever teaches us to talk to ourselves is important: whatever teaches us to sing ourselves out of despair. But the painting has also taught me that we can speak to each other across time. And I feel I have something very serious and urgent to say to you, my non-existent reader, and I feel I should say it as urgently as if I were standing in the room with you. That life—whatever else it is—is short. That fate is cruel but maybe not random. That Nature (meaning Death) always wins but that doesn’t mean we have to bow and grovel to it. That maybe even if we’re not always so glad to be here, it’s our task to immerse ourselves anyway: wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open. And in the midst of our dying, as we rise from the organic and sink back ignominiously into the organic, it is a glory and a privilege to love what Death doesn’t touch.Sadly, it goes on after that to bury the well-made point and the well-turned phrase in verbiage.Donna Tartt won a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in recognition of this novel. I am not equipped with the information the judges of that prize use to make their decision. I can only say that, from my perspective as a reader, this is a good, solid read that should've been 600pp not 771pp, with many lovely phrases and a lot of good, well-incorporated action, but not especially prize-worthy. It's a thumping good read, as my friend Suz says.And for that reason, I'd take it to a desert island, and I'd cuss and fume and fret about its shortcomings after I finished each read wet-eyed about Theo and his travails. Sometimes Theo acts so damned clueless I wanted to give him a bloody box of chocolates and a bench and plant a Barnaby Rudgely raven called Grip on his damn shoulder. And then:You could study the connections for years and never work it out--it was all about things coming together, things falling apart, time warp, my mother standing out in front of the museum when time flickered and the light went funny, uncertainties hovering on the edge of a vast brightness, the stray chance that might, or might not, change everything.So, yeah, this is the one that makes the desert island trip. Sorry, Eleanor Catton, your gorgeous and so very deserving tome will wait for me safe on my shelf.

There are probably a lot more deserving people out there for these books. But that's the benefit of being Karen's best friend, and she does get it right most of the time since she'll take offense at not getting it right all the time, where she gets it wrong is with her dislike of Gravity's Rainbow, her almost stellar taste is marred by that one blemish, but no one can be perfectThis is not an easy book to review. If you haven't read this book yet and you look forward to reading it I would recommend treading lightly while reading other reviews. I haven't seen too many yet, and the ones I have seen are just fine, but I do imagine once this book is released there will be more than a few 'book reports' of the novel given. And seriously any book report of this is a major spoiler. Any. Unless you like reading almost eight hundred page books and not letting the author craft the story in her own wonderous way and would like some internets book reviewer to usurp the meticulous way she discloses just about every detail of the story. ..threw out some kind of weird handshake--part gang member, part fraternity boy, past International Sign Language--that I wasn't sure how to return. In confusion I withdrew my hand and--not knowing what else to do--bumped fists with him, feeling stupid.Besides the masterful manner she tells the story, what impressed me most about the book was how deftly Donna Tartt wrote from the male perspective. I'm sure that there are more than a few parts of this book where Tartt's voice comes through in place of the main character's, but even when (if?) it does, this is a long novel written in a quite authentic sounding male perspective (ok, a very particular type of male, and maybe one that I can relate to on a bunch of levels so it feels sort of like, hey she's getting it right....), which maybe isn't all that impressive, since it's a skill novelists have had in their toolboxes for quite some time now. Maybe it's just reading another book recently that was so obviously just the author rambling on about things he didn't like and then calling it a novel, and a technical one at that because he had the gumption to only hit enter and tab once to start only a second paragraph in all over a hundred and something pages that I'm feeling more in awe of the finely constructed workmanship on display in this novel. Her nailing the male voice was reminiscent to me of the way A.M. Homes got it right also in her latest novel, May We Be Forgiven. I thought about not giving this book five stars though. There were a few parts of the book that I wasn't completely fond of, and while I think that the main character was wonderfully done, I also thought that he was a bit tiresome at times, but I also think that I'm quite tiresome at times and the sort of person he is, well he should be a bit tiresome and much at times. Not that there was anything wrong with him as a character, he just didn't shine sometimes like the supporting cast of characters did. If I'd read more than one Charles Dickens novel I'd say that this is sort of like what he does, with such great secondary characters that really bring to life the story. But I might just be talking out of my ass here. It wouldn't be the first time for that. There are also certain things in the book I would have liked to have seen resolved in different ways, and I will admit to feeling frustrated that what I wanted wasn't happening, but just because a book didn't meet my exact expectations, great as they may be, doesn't mean that the book is worse for that. It's probably actually better for not doing what I wanted it to do. If I'd been steering this plot there probably would have been some serious bullshit resolutions going on.So I'll admit I was toying with giving his four stars because it didn't quite go the way I wanted, but I'm also not sure exactly what I wanted, or how everything could have been resolved in a satisfying manner if the couple of things I wanted to happen had happened. What else.There are some interesting mentions of music in the book. I think you could find worse things to do on a summer evening than look on Spotify some of the classical composers mentioned as being on Theo's and Pippa's iPods and giving them a listen. She also mentions Belle and Sebastian and Arvo Pärt, two favorites of mine for different listening moods. I thought of making a playlist of things she mentioned in the book, but I sort of forgot and I have to be passing on this ARC soon, but maybe if I get a regular trade edition I'll embark on this quest. There are actual things about the book I'd kind of like to write about, but I'll leave them be, I'm really paranoid about the whole spoiler thing, not that they are major spoilers, but just wonderful ways she handles the story that if I say much more I'll just ruin, and I have no interest in ruining this for anyone. Oh, yeah I'm supposed to mention that I got this book for free, from either Netgalley, the publisher, author or through some other way that I get books to read before they are published. Apparently it's a federal law to mention this (for reals?) and not just a cheap reason to float the shit out of my reviews. I haven't been given any monies, nor have I been coerced in anyway to write the review you just read. Huzzah!"
65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have not read Donna Tartt's other books. Even though, she has gotten much critical acclaim, the stories just didn't seem to interest me, but for some reason I was attracted to The Goldfinch. I was at first put off by the length - 775 pages in the kindle version. I will admit that there may have been a few times when I felt that it dragged on a bit, but there was never a moment that I thought that I would put it down. This is the best book I have read this year and may very well be one of my favorites ever. From the beginning I was so taken by the story of Theo Decker and I cared about what happened to him from the first page to the last. The cast of incredible characters in Theo's life, Tartt's absolutely beautiful descriptive, detailed writing were for me spell binding. It's a story of insurmountable loss, friendship, love, art, and some deeply philosophical themes that I would not presume to write about. Starting with the bombing at the Museum of Art and the death of his mother , Theo’s life if filled with sadness . The losses just continue until Theo finally loses himself to drugs, finds himself involved in the underworld of stolen art , as the result of his taking the painting of the goldfinch on that fateful day. But no matter what he does, even towards the end with the incredible and complicated series of events that lead him to the depths of despair, my heart was broken for him as he says “Because , here’s the truth: life is catastrophe. …..better never born than born into this cesspool. “ Then somehow on the last pages, Theo finds some good, some hope – “That maybe even if we’re not always so glad to be here, it’s our task to immerse ourselves anyway: wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open….For if disaster and oblivion have followed this painting down through time - so too has love.”It’s too long of a book to think about reading again now , but I might have to someday."

67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63274287-kon-r,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book does the painting justice. It was lovingly crafted over the span of 10 years and it shows. The book is sooooo long, but in order to tell the story properly and have the reader fully appreciate it it needs to be. That's why the film version flopped so bad. I can see this being a series because only that medium would allow you to fall in love with the story in the same manner. This is definitely one of those ""it's the journey not the destination"" type books. If you focus on just the painting you may feel like it drones on and on. It's not about the painting. The painting is a key part of it, but this is a coming of age story about a boy who experiences great levels of loss at an unbelievably early age. Theo is always struggling for a stable home and life, but nothing is coming to him easily. When you factor in his never-wavering sense of right and wrong, he is always battling his inner demons just to survive another day. What an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. Even the ending leaves the reader with a lot to think about. Just like real life, it's complicated and is open to interpretation."

The author Donna Tartt is a literary master.The book is long, more than 700 pages, but don't let that put you off. It doesn't feel like work, in fact, I couldn't put it down it drags you into the story of a boy who loses his mother and is burdened with a priceless painting. The description of how he loses his mother had my heart racing -- literally -- pounding in my chest. Her death takes place in New York's Metropolitan Museum, and by now you probably know as a consequence of a terrorist bomb. The scenes that follow are so real I felt like I was Theo like I was home waiting for my mother, my only care-giver. It was too real. Impossible to read. Impossible not to. The story changes gear several times and every time it kept me hanging on, gripping onto the edge of my proverbial reading chair. Theo, the narrator has no roots, is bounced around from home to home, living with a series of people -- a friend from school, his absent father, and the gay partner of the man he watched die in the bomb blast. He plunges into depression, drugs, crime, an evoking boyhood friendship, and even, for a short while, homelessness.His only stability, his secret (priceless painting, The Goldfinch) which he keeps nearby and hidden. We experience his wounds and the consequences of them and the dislocation of his life - emotional, physical, and spiritual. There are so many twists and turns in this tale of a motherless boy whose life involves dramatic changes and is peopled with a vast cast of characters, many of whose affections and intentions remain unclear, they all have their own stuff to deal with.The painting – one that actually exists in the world – is The Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius, a student of Rembrandt's, who died at the age of 32 when a gunpowder factory near his studio exploded. Almost all his work was destroyed. The Goldfinch is widely considered the finest of the paintings that survived. At the beginning of the book, Theo's mother, moments before she dies says, ""anything we manage to save from history is a miracle,"" and this theme runs deep through the veins of the novel. It should come as no surprise, that Theo's only treasure becomes an opportunity for betrayal, suspicion, double-dealing, and crime. Not all action and suspense, some of the book's most memorable moments happen in stillness. The prose is glorious. I highlighted over a hundred passages to revisit for their beautiful craft. This novel is much more than plot and characters it takes you much further. The last few pages integrate all the serious, big, complicated ideas beneath the surface and holds them up to the light. Not with clever riffs, humor or op-ed themes but to a place beyond that – to a place of meaning, or, as the author refers to it, ""a rainbow edge … where all art exists, and all magic. And … all love."""

We are rarely unanimous about the books we read but this time was an exception. We wondered how our collective opinion could differ so radically from that of the jury for the Pulitzer Prize.

71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin,Rating 3 out of 5,"My experience reading The Goldfinch was a rocky one. It started off strong with a terrorist attack on a museum, the loss of a mother, a mysterious young girl, and a stolen painting of a, you guessed it, goldfinch. The first few chapters set the stage for what I anticipated would be a long journey unfolding how Theo comes with the death of his mom, who the girl is, and how he got the painting back to the museum, if he actually did. But what ultimately happens as the book meanders on is... a lot of filler, a lot of nothing. Many of the characters felt cartoonish and unrealistic. There’s a lot of drugs and a lot of crime. Every two chapters jumps the story forward a few years, and even though the time advanced, the story never felt like it did. Theo just spends a lot of time doing drugs and talking about art or furniture. He bounces around to different locations, commits more crimes, and spends page after page thinking too much. I’ve read plenty of reviews that praise Tartt’s writing, but I just wasn’t feeling it. From the beginning I was annoyed by how lazily she described things. Rather than use adjectives or descriptive language, she just used nouns and commas. For example, and this is not an exaggeration, I will describe my morning to you in the style of Donna Tartt....“I woke up and got dressed. Shirt, pants, shoes. I made myself a cup of coffee, adding other stuff to it. Cream, sugar, cinnamon. I looked at the books on my shelf to decide what to read. The Goldfinch, Dickens, poetry. I decided to plow through The Goldfinch so I could finish it today. I had other books waiting to be read. Gilead, Blood Meridian, others. I read several chapters before making breakfast. Eggs, sausage, toast. I ate breakfast and grabbed the other stuff I needed. Keys, wallet, phone....”You get the point. Speaking of Dickens, after just finishing Great Expectations, I noticed so many similarities in this book. She was definitely inspired by him in writing The Goldfinch, and she even references him at least once, maybe twice. Three, four, five. Anyway, the story, when it was on, when things moved, it was good. It started and ended pretty well, but the book could have easily been half the size without all the bloat and it would have delivered a better result. Shorter, more concise, more enjoyable. There’s a movie coming out later this year based on the book, and maybe a movie will enhance the story more since it has less time to tell it. We’ll see. I’m not sure I understand the Pulitzer Prize anymore. I finished the book, it was engaging at times, the story was interesting, but it was very lopsided for me. The middle was a bit tedious to wade through, but there’s enough there for me to push it to three stars. Now it’s time to read some shorter books. "

73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,Rating 5 out of 5,"Low buzzing noise, inside the room. Guiltily I turned - someone coming? No: only Popchik, cotton white after his bath, nestled among the pillows of her unmade bed and snoring with a drooling, blissful, half-purring sound. And though there was something pathetic about it - taking comfort in her left-behind things like a puppy snuggled in an old coat - I crawled in under the sheets and nestled down beside him, smiling foolishly at the smell of her comforter and the silky feel of it on my cheek.This is really hard for me to rate.WHAT WAS GOOD:1.) The writing. The writing isn't just good - it's excellent. The book is a beautiful work of art. I mean, as a piece of writing, not the physical book although that's nice, too. Tartt writes wonderful, exquisite, touching, truthful passages. She also has a stunning vocabulary that had me scrambling for a dictionary more than once. Actually, probably about 100 times.2.) The physical book. It is printed (at least the hardback first edition) on some kind of silky, high-quality paper that you will find yourself absentmindedly stroking at odd times while reading. o.O3.) The book is a bit funny! This was the loveliest surprise to me. I would have been 10x more likely to pick this up if I had known it was going to make me laugh. I mean, it's not a laughfest! But at least one good laugh every fifty pages. I was chuckling out loud, even in public. Such a plus! Who wants to read something boring or sad? Or even worse, boring AND sad?4.) Excellent, fleshed-out characters that you can easily visualize. For the most part.5.) The amazing, wonderful and strange friendship between Borys and Theo that I adored. It was very intense and very..., I don't know. I just really, really liked it. I think this aspect of the book is where Tartt's being a female shows through.What do you mean by that?Okay. Do you know how we always ask and analyze if male authors have written ""good"" (meaning accurate, I guess) female characters? But this question is rarely turned around. Does this female author write ""good"" (meaning accurate) male characters?Tartt chooses to make her main character a boy. (I say 'boy' because he is 13-15 for 60% or so of the book). The friendship between Borys and Theo really threw me for a loop. I had no idea boys had friendships like this. You'd know what I mean if you read the book. The only people I've known with friendships like this one are a.) girls/women and b.) men who have been through some shit together (war, prison, concentration camps of any sort, grown up in the orphanage together... stuff like that).So it was strange to me to see the boys in this kind of friendship together. Had they been through some shit? Yes, I suppose you could argue that this is the reason they had such an intense and strong and close and telepathic friendship, but to me that argument doesn't really hold water. But I'll accept it as a theory. The shit these boys went through was separate shit, not shared shit. Which is why it was harder for me to think this was a super-realistic friendship. But okay. I adored the friendship, whether it was realistic or not.6.) Great portrayal of mourning and PTSD....WHAT WAS BAD:Sigh.1.) The first 428 pages of the book (out of 771), when Theo is aged 13-16ish were amazing and I really loved them. However, after that, when Theo is an adult (starting on page 429 when it's '8 years later' and Theo is 23ish) I hated him. I despised him. I couldn't stand him.Why?Because Adult Theo is a dirtbag. Now, granted, as a kid Theo was a dirtbag, too. However, I am forgiving of kids. I can forgive and understand 13-15-year-old Theo for doing all kinds of shit. He's a child/teen, his mom died in a horrific way, his choice of friends is... less than savory, ... all that and it's resulting events I can understand and forgive. Fine.But when it turns out he's grown and he's pulling the same shit at age 25 that he did when he was 14, well, that's where I have some problems.But aren't you compassionate towards someone who's mother died and who has PTSD?Sure. Sure I'm compassionate. But we're talking about someone who 12 years (TWELVE YEARS) after the 'accident' still cannot do basic, human things like be honest, have a healthy romantic relationship, or live a single day without heavy drugs and alcohol use and I'm like -_-Come on. PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, MAN. Stop being such a weak-ass, pathetic-ass, dumbass, sorry excuse for a human being. I can't STAND the way he just goes through life, doing whatever comes into his head: sleeping with married/partnered women, cheating on women, hiding girlfriends from one another, selling fake antiques to people for tons of money - putting not only himself but his kind, sweet, honest business-partner/adoptive-father at risk, and being a very heavy drinker and serious drug addict.The only thing I could understand and have sympathy for was the alcohol and drug addiction. I have sympathy for that, even though I really didn't like it - especially since he is completely unconcerned with it and has been doing it for over a decade.He has NO thought of his future, NO love for anyone but himself, never fucking thinks about anyone but himself, he's a selfish being who just wallows in self-pity 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. He's pathetic. Weak. Completely despicable.Oh, but he loves Pippa!Are you flippin' kidding me? No he doesn't. She's not even a real person to him, more like a teddy bear he's reaching out for or some kind of substitute for his mother. She, at least, tries to work on her shit and become a better person. She makes effort (I know it's hard!) to get back her life and she also tries hard to live in the world and be her own agent, whereas Theo just kind of sits there.And I didn't like Borys either - he's a dirtbag in his own right, striking his girlfriend and giving her a fat lip, also a druggie and an alcoholic, not to mention a thief who steals anything and everything that isn't nailed down - but at least he has a spine and some zest for life. Theo is just a sadsack who seems to think life isn't worth living. IT'S SO AGGRAVATING. I was seriously frustrated and angry to no end with Adult Theo.And he's DUMB. DUMB, DUMB, DUMB. I'm talking about when he goes with Borys to Amsterdam to get the painting back. And then he's all shocked and having second thoughts when Borys has a gun! Oh, wow, what did you THINK this was going to be like, cupcake?!!?!? Fuck. So stupid.AND THEN, he's all sitting in his hotel room, moping around, and completely ready to turn himself in and blow the whole operation AND/OR commit suicide.I WAS JUST SO ANGRY WITH HIM. CHICKENSHIT LITTLE CRYBABY SPINELESS DIRTBAG. Ugh.And then there was no end to his philosophical bullshit whining about how life has no meaning and life is shit and all this stuff. *$#$ ^%#$*. Spare me! Stand up and start acting like a man! PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER. Can't you see you're hurting the people around you, not to mention putting them in danger!?!?!?! Selfish.Okay. I'm calm. Breathe, Carmen. Breathe....The book isn't really about the Goldfinch (the painting). Instead, the painting acts as a sort of touchstone, bringing all the pieces and parts of the novel together. Which was a relief. I like art but I can't understand the way people go on about it. And there was a bit of that in this novel, but not so much ""Art is God! Worship art! Art is the meaning of life!"" stuff that I was upset. Just the right balance, in my opinion....The thing that made me most sad in this book was...Parents die.Um, no.Drug and alcohol addictions suck.No. I mean, they do, but that's not what really got me.People you love betray you.That's heartbreaking both Theo's betrayal of Hobie and Borys's betrayal of Theo, but no.You love someone in a romantic way but they don't feel the same way.No. Actually I was angry with him for mooning after Pippa for a billion years when she was clearly ""We're just friends."" Can't take a hint.No, what REALLY got to me and made me sad was the stark reality that children have no agency and are kind of foisted off on whoever is willing to care for them. It's sad and terrifying to end up with relatives who don't want you, family friends who don't love you, people who abuse you, some random foster home where no one cares if you disappear for days or not... etc. etc. etc. Stuff like this is so real and so accurate and it makes me very sad....This book strongly reminded me of The Catcher in the Rye. It has the same kind of tone to it. Take that as you will.I was also struck with similarities to A Christmas Carol, most especially in the last 50 pages or so....Tl;dr - This book is a beautifully written work of art. But do you know what is just (if not more) important than the writing? The story. And I adored the first 60% of the book when Theo is young. However, once Theo hit adulthood I found myself increasingly angry, frustrated, and infuriated with him and his complete disregard for his own life and the lives of others. The ending didn't mollify me, either.Would I recommend reading this? I would say yes. It's gorgeous. But not perfect and certainly not a book that made me happy. More like a book that made me growl. At least it had a sense of humor occasionally. Without the laughs, I would have rated this much lower.Read at your own risk."

I do not read a lot of very long books from writers I enjoy this much, and just letting myself read it in long stretches and short sips for a couple of weeks was bliss. The second time around felt very different. It turned out I only remembered the first half and had completely blanked out the second. Las Vegas didn't seem nearly so long the second time and not nearly so frustrating. Whereas the end felt both rushed and too long, the place where I did actually see places where some trimming would have been nice. I know people think it is too long, but there is so much that Tartt does when she lets us stretch out with the characters. Theo is so adept at withholding information from us and then casually dropping it so it is easily to miss how truly damaged and broken he is as he gives you the most important information in little bits here and there, never all at once. I still love the way this book is a modern version of the 19th century classics, a big fat story with themes of guilt and love and betrayal and crime and art and loyalty. I love the intricacy of its characters (I really did love Boris the second time around, I found him rather trying the first time. When you know he is not a distraction but part of the main event, an Artful Dodger type, it is much easier to relax and enjoy him. That is true for much of the book, honestly.)I still have no idea if this will actually work as a film, with it all condensed and shortened, but I'm glad I had a reread before the movie.____________Why did I decide to read ""David Copperfield"" when I was in college? Because Donna Tartt loved Dickens and was compared to Dickens and I figured I should read some Dickens. I suffered through that book. What I know now is that I should've read ""Great Expectations"" because that's where I see the similarities to Tartt. And now that I've read ""The Goldfinch"" I think the two go together beautifully. There are definitely shades and echoes of ""Great Expectations"" here. And lots of Dickensian flair... if Dickens had lived today and wrote about pill-popping and terrorist threats and such. (Which he would have, of course.)What has always impressed me about Tartt, and what she does here to an even greater extent than her previous novels, is how masterfully she pulls you through her story. I get hooked on her books as much as any suspense or mystery novel. I simply can't stop reading them. Her twists and turns are just plain brilliant and always unexpected. And that she can do all this with her prose is ridiculous. Her writing can go from sparse to lush on a dime and it never feels show-offy or indulgent. I rarely find first-person narratives wholly convincing, but she does it and I don't know how, but she does.If you're a Tartt fan, if--like me--The Secret History is basically your favorite book of all time, you won't be disappointed by The Goldfinch."
75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin,Rating 3 out of 5,"MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading ListI really hate that I didn't love this book to death like so many others :-(I would say I loved the first half or maybe a little more of the book, I felt like it was too long and some of the things I wasn't interested in toward the end. First off this painting by Carel Fabritius 1654 is so beautiful, so simple and so beautiful. It seemed like a normal day with Theo and his mom going to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. but it wasn't anywhere near normal, this was the day (at thirteen-years-old) that Theo lost his mom when a bomb went off at the museum. Theo wakes up in the rubble and makes his way out. Theo meets a man that was trapped and gives him a ring for Theo to take it to his partner. And on the way out Theo takes the Goldfinch painting as well, that followed him throughout his childhood and adult life. When the social services find out that Theo is alone, that his mom died in the bombing, and his dad was who knows where as he left when Theo was a toddler and that his grandparents were too sick to take him... they set him up with a childhood friend and his family. It took a bit for Theo to try to fit in with this family... well I mean he's still in shock!.. but the family was rich and had their own little ways. Most of the kids were brats, but his friend Andy, I thought he was cool. It seems as soon as he starts to settle in, his no good father and girlfriend show up to take him from his home in New York to Las Vegas. We all know this is not a good idea, but he's Theo's father so that's what has to be done. I mean some people don't need to be parents! We all know his father just came back to try to get money etc. So, Theo's new life in Vegas isn't that great. He meets a friend named Boris that gets him into all kinds of drugs, which sucks. But I did like Theo and Boris as friends though. And I'm glad they found each other again in the end when they were adults. Anyway, a bunch of stuff goes down and Theo heads back to New York. Oh, I forgot to mention that Theo did get the ring back to Hobie and told him about his partner's (I forget his name) last moments. Hobie and he owned an antique store, where Hobie fixed up the old things etc. Theo started hanging around Hobie and they became good friends. So later on when he came back to town he lived with Hobie and learned the trade and became a partner with Hobie. I think this is where it took the turn for me. Theo is being harassed by someone that wants the painting and other things and so forth and so on. It's a big ole mess. I felt really bad at what Theo had to go through, it's like he didn't even have time to miss his mom at all. Everything pretty much worked out. There were some other people in the book that I liked and some that were real twats of course. What a beautiful little bird is the Goldfinch, and I hope more people get to read this book. :-) "

79,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I am in the ""thank God this book is over"" camp. The premise of the story was pretty good, so I looked forward to reading it (my book group selected it based on the theme). Having often thought ""I can't go on,"" I did manage to plow through this, seemingly, never-ending quagmire of hopelessness and despair that offered me no meaningful resolution, even at the bitter end. I don't even have a good sense of how it ended, though I got to the end! In spite of his long soliloquy at the end of the book, I never got a good sense of how (or if) Theo evolved (in my mind he didn't).This might have made an interesting short-story or novella, but, instead, it was much too long, droning on and on about details and characters that had already been beaten to death. The writing style was stilted for me: too many sentences starting with ""I,""... and never finished; most of the dialogue was no more than one character monopolizing the conversation (monologues). Although I could feel some sympathy for the characters, the whole premise was so far-fetched (so many random orphans, such a total lack of happy people, such constant self-destructiveness, such boring people)that I lost interest in them and saw no redeeming qualities in any of them. If the point of this book is to feel what it's like to be in the heads of people suffering from PTSD, who are not recognized by anyone as having PTSD, who have no insight for seeking help or moving forward with their lives in constructive ways, who use it as a reason to self-destruct and destroy others with them - then maybe Ms. Tartt got the job done. It took the author 10 years to write this book; it will take me 10 minutes to forget it."

My thoughts on it are mostly positive. I have thought about this book and story A LOT since I finished it. There are definitely some parts I hated, and some things that felt icky (the number of times white characters say the N word for literally, no fucking reason) BUT, the core story did impact me, and I loved the sections following Theo and Boris, as well as the parts following Theo as an adult. The art sections were intriguing to me and kickstarted me to look more into art. And I can't lie, I wanna go to this museum and see this paining!So would I reread it? Probably not - it's too long and badly need editing and I'm not sure I want to go through it all again. but will I continue to this about this book, it's characters and it's themes almost every day of my life for the forseeable future? yesOH MY GOD I FINISHED IT ...

And I add my own love story to the history of people who have loved beautiful things, and look out for them, and pull them from the fire, and sought them when they were lost, and tried to preserve them and save them while passing them along literally from hand to hand, singing out brilliantly from the wreck of time to the next generation of lovers, and the next

Hobie said: beauty alters the grain of reality. And I keep thinking too of the more conventional wisdom: namely, that the pursuit of pure beauty is a trap, a fast track to bitterness and sorrow, that beauty has to be wedded to something more meaningful. Only what is that thing? Why am I made the way I am? Why do I care about all the wrong things, and nothing at all for the right ones""

“Caring too much for objects can destroy you. Only—if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn’t it? And isn’t the whole point of things—beautiful things—that they connect you to some larger beauty?”

Ugh. https://nowtoronto.com/movies/tiff201...***Donna Tartt's big, bold, boisterous doorstop of a novel uses a tragic accident and a priceless 17th century Dutch painting to reflect on fate, grief, beauty, friendship and mortality.At nearly 800 pages, it could use tightening, but there's such heart and wisdom packed in here that I wouldn't want to lose a word. Tartt has matured considerably since penning The Secret History.The plot, complete with a few Dickensian coincidences, is beautifully paced; the settings (New York City, Las Vegas, Amsterdam) vivid; and the characters – from a wide variety of backgrounds – simply unforgettable. It's no surprise that she can write about privileged Upper East Side types. But she shows equal skill getting inside the heads of restless Vegas dreamers or low-life European gangsters; she can make us feel what it's like to be a junkie aching for a fix; in her hands, the world of antique furniture restoring becomes thrilling.And while there's an old-fashioned feel to the narrative, with obvious nods to Dickens, the book's tone is decidedly unsentimental and modern. Bursting with life, light and energy, The Goldfinch is a modern masterpiece."
82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2352900-elaine,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Goldfinch started out a five-star plus read, the first 500 pages or so were the most compulsively readable fiction I’ve read in quite some time. (Not necessarily “the best”, mind you, whatever that is, but that wonderful immersed feeling where you look forward to getting back to your book, where a whole commute goes by in a bated breath, and bedtimes go by the wayside). But then it fell off, sharply. The last 3rd dragged for me. Even beloved Boris started to grate. Tartt has always gotten a few more balls up in the air than she can gracefully land. Secret History worked, nonetheless, The Little Friend utterly failed. This book was somewhere in between. It ended, and not incompetently, but the last few hundred pages dragged, dabbled in cliché and deus ex machina resolutions, and somehow did not satisfy. But there was a lot to love here. Starting with the gut punch of the opening sections, an almost claustrophobically gripping nightmare of an opener, especially for all of us who were here during 9/11 and have turned, at some point, in the wee hours, to the black fantasy of what if it were me, how would I get out, how would I react. But Tartt adds a particularly traumatic twist – she takes the Met, a place that is a place of refuge, solace and enchantment for so many of us, especially those of us who grew up here – and makes it her Ground Zero. Intense. I had a panicky feeling reading those chapters. Tartt effectively brings us into the world of PTSD that is the novel’s landscape.And all of Theo’s childhood was wonderful. His Holly Golightly-esque mother, the amazing Barbours (stepped out of the pages of the Preppy Handbook), timeless unworldly Hobie, barren Las Vegas and brilliant picaresque Boris. I just kept turning pages – enthralled, saddened, yes, of course, but just enjoying reading and the ride. (Time is so interesting in this novel: Hobie is timeless, but so much of the novel is just as achronistic (more than anachronistic). The opening scene and fourteen years later are both incontrovertibly “now” – but so many of the characters seem sepia toned – is Hobie and Mrs. Barbour’s New York now? Or 50 years ago? Or never – except in the fantasy of the extraurban arrival from the heartland – Theo’s mother, Truman Capote, Tartt herself?)I especially enjoyed the way the book was a love poem to New York and to literature - particularly children’s literature and New York literature. (Yes, Dickens of course – Oliver Twist, Great Expectations, David Copperfield, a great debt to the Old Curiosity Shop but also so very much Catcher in the Rye, and then so much else – from Breakfast at Tiffany’s to the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. Certainly a little Wharton and James along the way. ) Tartt plays in a world that is both satisfyingly real and satisfyingly imaginary – especially to those of us whose imagination is irretrievably deformed by literature! But then – we bog down. A few too many drugs. A few too many nightmares. A few too many raveling and unraveling plot threads. At one point, there is the perfect ending – a lovely coming full circle, and, in a book soaked in Dickens, a perfect tribute to Scrooge’s redemption in A Christmas Carol. But then the book goes on, and on. Finally concluding with a 10 page exhortatory essay that I couldn’t make sense of as coming from Theo. After all that drama, we are left with a rather adolescent Romantic poetry-esque invocation to rage against the dying of the light, while remembering that Beauty is Truth … I know some people I respect have loved that ending, but it felt cheap to me, in light of all that had come before, a sort of ""Cliff Notes key to the novel"" postscript instead of coming to terms with a proper ending. Ah well, still undoubtedly worth the candle (or kilo of candles, as the case may be). And in 10 years, when both Ms. Tartt and I have slipped irrevocably into late middle age, I shall be sure to read her next investigation of childhood and adolescence (really – have you noticed? Tartt doesn’t do grownups? But we’ll save that for another day)."

I was so desperate to love this book and at the beginning, I thought I would. The writing was beautiful, the plot intrigued me and I grew to care for the main character really quickly. But then it would take a plunge and I was bored out of my mind. And that's the main issue I had with it. It wasn't consistent and would constantly fluctuate. At times, I wanted to burst and declare my love for it and shout from the rooftops, to it leaving me feeling just completely empty! I was dreading to pick it back up and had to force myself to do so! And it's not that I have an issue with slow burning plots either - take Stoner, or A Little Life as an example. I just could not connect with this book. Too much unnecessary detail for me.

85,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541416-teresa,Rating 5 out of 5,"While I enjoyed Tartt's first two novels, The Secret History and The Little Friend (see my review), there was something missing from each that held me back from thinking they were great. I have no reservations here.Though this is not a novel of 9/11, I can't help but wonder if it is (partly) Tartt's response to it. It certainly seems to be informed by the event, as it details and describes a character (actually two characters, though the other is in the 'middle-ground' of the story) who has survived a catastrophic event in NYC and suffers from PTSD, how his life is irrevocably altered by one event, spiraling out of control and into choices that are unconscious and perhaps fated. The prevalence of drugs in the world -- and the results of their easy access -- is also a relevant, contemporary topic.When the story would become almost unbearably bleak, the subtle allusions to Dickens' works was exciting (at least, to me, a Dickens fan), causing me to smile, especially the last one when Theo wakes up in his hotel room and realizes ... well, I won't give it anyway. While grasping these literary references isn't essential, they are more than just for fun: they fit an overarching theme about the relationship of art, any kind of art, to the individual, a theme beautifully described in the last few pages, pages that brought tears to my eyes, even more so when I reread them this morning. Theo has The Goldfinch in the same way I believe Donna Tartt has Dickens."

I loved the first hundred pages, Hobe, Pippa even liked the last 80 pgs. It was the middle that did me in, it dragged, discussed every drug taken, teenage angst, so much could have been cut out of this and still kept the integrity of the story. Wished there had been more discussions of the art, at least I would have felt I learned something. Well written, yes. Entertaining form some, but was mostly a struggle for me. Maybe would have liked it more if 200 or more pages were cut from it. I think Pulitzer prize winners and I just do not relate. Did not like the Goon Squad or Tinkers either. Oh well, moving on."

Fully deserving of the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, The Goldfinch is a triumph of a novel, one that I will have a hard time reviewing (so bear with me & my ramblings).Donna Tartt seamlessly weaves together a Dickensian bildungsroman with a suspenseful and thrilling descent into the criminal underbelly of the art world (forgeries & thefts ahoy!) that boasts the same exquisite prose as her debut novel.This Odyssean coming-of-age is narrated by Theo Decker. At 13 Theo lives alone with his mother after his father, a temperamental alcoholic, decided to take up and leave New York. After Theo gets in trouble at his school he and his mother are required to attend a ‘conference’. On the way there, the two end up in a museum, for what should have been a quick gander. When a bomb explodes in the museum many die, including Theo’s mother. Once Theo awakes from the explosion he comes across a dying old man who urges him to take Carel Fabritius's ‘The Goldfinch’. Theo, probably suffering from a head concussion & shock, does as he’s bid, takes the painting.“The painting had made me feel less mortal, less ordinary. It was support and vindication; it was sustenance and sum. It was the keystone that had held the whole cathedral up.”When Theo is informed of his mother’s death he’s devastated. He has no idea where his deadbeat father is and his grandparents have made it clear that they aren’t keen on having him stay with them. Theo is temporarily placed in the custody of his childhood friend's family, the Barbours, a hideously wealthy family. Later on, his father re-emerges and whisks away from New York to Las Vegas. Here Theo is left very much to his own devices, his father—who is clearly involved in some dodgy stuff—and his girlfriend do not seem particularly fond or interested in him and his upbringing. Theo becomes friends with Boris who, like him, does not have a stable home life. Together the two experiment with alcohol and drugs and commit petty crimes.We follow Theo until his late-teens and then we encounter him again as a young(ish) adult who becomes entangled in some dangerous business that force him to fully confront the kind of person that he has become.What to say? My heart went out to Theo. Yes, later in life he’s a bit of an asshole. That doesn’t cancel out all of his other qualities and complexities. Those sections recounting his boyhood are truly heartbreaking. The despair he feels at his mother’s death, the guilt, grief, longing, self-hatred, and loneliness that seem to punctuate his days are captured with exacting precision. His meditations on life, art, the people around him are striking, and I appreciated how nuanced a person he was. His relationship with Boris was one of the highlights of his narrative. It is incredible just how good Tartt is at making you care for people who are just not that nice. The dynamic between Theo and Boris is intense and messy (possibly more than a friendship?) and despite their different temperaments their similar circumstances and self-destructive tendencies fortify their bond (they are definitely good at enabling each other).His mother’s death haunts Theo throughout his life, and we see just how his survivor’s guilt affects and influences him. To Theo, the painting of ‘The Goldfinch’ is irrevocably connected to her death, which is why he’s unable to part ways with it. He's also hopelessly enamoured with Pippa, who he first glimpsed in the museum on that fateful day. She's one of the few people who understands the guilt that plagues him so. Alas, he comes to idealise in a not so healthy way.His story is filled with stops-and-starts, addiction and suicidal ideation & tendencies punctuate his life, and as an adult, he seems already to have taken a dubious path.I loved this novel. Tartt’s writing is divine. Her prose is simultaneously elegant and exhilarating, her characterization, dialogues, descriptions, are all truly exemplary. She brings to life the people, places, and situations she writes of in a way that is almost too real, so that when forces outside of my control (the end of my lunch break or commute.) put an end to my reading time, well, it felt like a rude awakening.As I said, this novel is long. A brick some would say (the hardback edition could seriously injure someone). Yet, I breezed through this. Not because it was easy reading, quite the contrary. Tartt’s erudite references and elaborate storytelling deserve attention and consideration, one cannot just rush their way through her books. And yet, I had a hard time putting this book down. Theo’s voice won me over so that I too found myself mirroring whatever he was feeling (usually sadness and or anxiety, yay). I didn’t want to let go of him, and I was actually sad once I reached the novel’s conclusion.While Tartt doesn’t go light on her characters, I could tell just how much she cares for them. The people inhabiting her novels may not necessarily be good or kind but by the end, I always end up loving them (despite or because of their many many flaws). Even characters I want to hate with the whole of my being are not wholly unredeemable.Tartt’s incisive reflections on human nature, life, grief, love, fate, art, death, struck me for their poignancy and thoughtfulness. The rich cast of characters is just as deserving of attention as Theo himself. Regardless of the part, they play in Theo's life, whether they are a friend, acquaintance, or a complete stranger, they are depicted in such vivid detail that they do not feel like fictional characters but real people.And Theo, ragazzo mio! On the one hand, many of his feelings, states of mind, motivations, fears & desires are rendered with clarity, on the other, well, the boy is not only traumatised but incredibly repressed and prone to self-deception. So, there are many moments when we cannot trust entirely his narration. His alcohol consumption and drug use also add a murky quality to certain events or portions of his story. Theo's intentional and unintentional untrustworthiness, in many ways, added an element of ambiguity to his narration and has us relying, more often than not, on other characters in order to discern the truth about certain people/events.I was captivated by Theo's story, the many lows and few highs of his adolescence and adulthood, and by the motifs dotting his narrative. The novel is also full of juxtaposition: the classic vs modern references, the bustling streets of New York, always buzzing with activity, vs the desolate landscapes of Las Vegas, the Barbours' apartment with Theo's father house. Like TSH, one of the novel's main concerns is beauty (the power that beautiful things have on us, the way we feel about that which is beautiful to us, the things we are willing to do for beauty or to have what we think beautiful). Beautiful, moving, wonderfully chaotic, a work of art. The Goldfinch is all of these things and so much more.ps: curiously enough the first time I read it I only gave it 3 stars...and I can’t really explain why this time around I loved it so much that even days later I find myself thinking about Theo & Boris."

WHAT A TIME.There were parts I really really loved about this book and parts I didn't really enjoy. I think overall I more loved it than didn't like it.Let's talk about the bad first, shall we? For the most part I really enjoy literary fiction, but sometimes there is a lot of really unnecessary information. This book is an example of that. While I definitely think it should still be a long book because it means more that way with how the story is told, probably 100-200 pages could've been shaved off because there were so many boring parts that were rough to get through and didn't really contribute to the story. When it was good it was FANTASTIC but when it was slow it was ROUGH.Theo was a pretty interesting main character, but he had a bad case of ""nice guy"" syndrome, especially when it came to Pippa. Quite a bit of entitlement there which just rubbed me the wrong way and made me cringe a lot.NOW FOR DA GOOD STUFF.The writing and story and world building were WONDERFUL. I felt like I was immersed in the story from page one and could see everything happening and imagine it. The writing was really beautiful but still easy to understand, which is not always the case with adult or literary fiction books. LOVEEE.The characters were phenomenal and seeing their journey over the years, especially Theo, was so great.I really enjoyed the story but I don't really want to say a ton about it because I think it's better NOT to know a lot about it going in. Suffice it to say this book is really engaging and the overall plot is so so interesting.And there you have it! I've said my piece. Loved parts of it, really disliked other parts of it.

Addiction to fear and doubt and to pain and loss. The story illustrates how one big trauma can splinter off into myriad little dramas and how, finally, the act of tiring of the dervish dance of it all forces an inward journey to the bottom where a small light can guide the person through. This book won’t be read in a day, but the fascination with the protagonist’s journey is likely to be remembered for much, much longer. I recommend this to everyone who has ever wondered how “people get that way” or why “people do what they do”. An amazing read from beginning to end. Well done, Ms Tartt."

I found it overly long and full of tedious passages of prose which went no where. If I had known that so much of the story would be about two pathetic junkies and their sordid lives I would never have started it. And so many unpleasant or nonsensical characters. Enough. I have to go and find a really good book to make me feel better.
93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79765515-prerna,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read an article a few months ago on Hierocles' idea of human relationships - he suggests that they are patterned on a series of concentric circles, like a succession of Russian nesting dolls and we occupy the innermost circle. Our challenge is to draw these circles closer together and I saw this marvelously unfolding in The Goldfinch, although sometimes, the innermost circle that Theo occupied shrunk hopelessly until he was but a dot, mourning, grieving and lonely. But the link between him and reality - the painting, The Goldfinch always drew him out, expanding his own worldview and giving him a taste of an immortal life.When I looked at the painting I felt the same convergence on a single point: a flickering sun-struck instant that existed now and forever. Only occasionally did I notice the chain on the finch’s ankle, or think what a cruel life for a little living creature—fluttering briefly, forced always to land in the same hopeless place.While the book beautifully deals with several themes - love, loss, addiction, art, immortality, grief, depression and life itself, what will stay with me for years to come is what I love the most in Virginia Woolf's novels - the scope of history, the simultaneous grandeur and decay of time, the sense of it passing irretrievably, the odd, cold feeling that sometimes washes over us on lonely nights, that we try so hard to thwart - we are but helpless spectators in our own lives.Of course it’s a lot more than that too. Shock and aura. Things are stronger and brighter and I feel on the edge of something inexpressible. Coded messages in the in-flight magazines. Energy Shield. Uncompromising Care. Electricity, colors, radiance. Everything is a signpost pointing to something else. And, lying on my bed in some frigid biscuit-colored hotel room in Nice, with a balcony facing the Promenade des Anglais, I watch the clouds reflected on sliding panes and marvel how even my sadness can make me happy, how wall to wall carpet and fake Biedermeier furniture and a softly murmuring French announcer on Canal Plus can all somehow seem so necessary and right.I’d just as soon forget, but I can’t. It’s kind of the hum of a tuning fork. It’s just there. It’s here with me all the time.When I was eighteen and dealing with a fresh bout of depression in my first year of college, the poem Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats was necessary reading material for my English literature paper. ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.""These lines opened up new, shimmering vistas for my hazy, muddled mind. And yesterday, as I finished The Goldfinch, I returned to these same vistas, only to find them changed - they are now bigger and and more pellucid. Tartt's book is suffused with the idea that by participating in art, even if it is as a mere spectator, we become a part of its transcendental truth, beauty and immortality. And so we live on. "

And fascinated. And excercising my awesome eyeroll. And wanting moar of this literate toffee goodness... Her style is the next best Enigma since the original Enigma. All's well as long as Tartt has enough paper around to write her endless books about world and love and meaning and feelings and descriptions of descriptions and meandering plots and every other fanciful stuff that she absolutely has to stuff into every book of hers! I'm kidding here, mostly.As is plenty usual for the Great and Awesome Madam Tartt, this book straddles the fine line between graphomania pseudovulgaris and instaclassics of the higher style. The ones one can fall in love with and never ever part. Never again.Excellent that I adore her style, even for its hyperwordiness. I love words, her words and worlds, especially meaningful ones. Since some of the stuff she writes seems to have been written just for the hell of it and out of necessity to use some more paper. And Tartt... she manages to include pretty much every shade of anything into her books. Paradoxically, to awesome effect! I've no idea just how she manages to pull it off. Must be that quite a lot of advanced Charms went into this text. You know, to get that pesky, frisky reader spellbound, deskbound, bookbound. I can just imagine the monologue: 'You won't be allowed to get back to your life, your business, your anything untill you finish your reading! Mwa-ha-ha!'Yes, there are many points of this book that are weaker than they probably should be but who am I kidding? I looooooved this novel and I totally can slide the points that I didn't care about.Review to be continued. RTF, TBD, bye. I'll be back for more of this rereadworthy goodiness junk!"

96,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar,Rating 5 out of 5,"Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/I read The Goldfinch over six months ago, but failed to ever write a review. What can I even say? I mean the damn thing won the PULITZER for crying out loud - there's not a whole lot my shitty little review can do to either undercut or validate that kind of prestige.So, what am I left with? I guess I'll address the complaints. Yes, The Goldfinch contains about eleven billion four hundred twenty-seven pages. Ms. Tartt is most definitely a fan of words. If you don't like long books, I can't guaranty you'll like this one just because of its award-winning status. Yes, The Goldfinch is not bambambambambam when it comes to action. There are lulls in the storyline . . . but when I think about which parts should have been culled from the novel, I can't name a one. Everything that happens does so for a reason - you just have to read the whole thing to figure it out. And finally, yes the characters are really not sympathetic. If you enjoy development that makes you fall in love with the main characters, this (once again) probably will not be your bag. I, however, love a good unlikeable character and lucky for me The Goldfinch was full of them.Bottom line is, I'm not so brave as to recommend this to really any one. All I can say is that I'm glad I decided to not be intimidated either by the size or the fact that the author was unknown to me and give it a shot. I'm also EXTREMELY thankful I never dropped this one on my little toe ; )Hey, looky there. I wrote an entire review with no .gifs. I'm super legit now."

Really?So I got through this book which, as everybody knows is...quite long.It is an extraordinary read. I am always saying not to judge another person for what they may or may not like but I have to admit I broke my own rule. Many One star ratings on here? I was surprised.I loved it, all 700 pages plus..what a long read! Beautiful, amazing, and so complex.Theo is am amazingly drawn character and so complex. It is hard not to adore him. He is lonely and alone and in search of redemption and he is oh so lovable. Gold Finch was exquisite.I read A secret History shortly afterward and while it was OK I really think this is her masterpiece. I am very glad she won the Pulitzer because if any book deserves it, it is this one.I have not seen the film version yet but it is on my radar. If you have not read this yet, clear your schedule and five in. It's some beautiful stuff. Five Golden stars. "
98,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie,Rating 3 out of 5,"I hate to be a buzzkill, but I don’t understand all the buzz about this insanely long book. Theo is a kid who survives a terrorist bomb that claims his mother’s life. He acquires a famous painting that tortures him. Theo’s father is a loser from Las Vegas; his best friend is a Ukrainian named Boris. Both his father and Boris use Theo, and they are dangerous, scary, and addicted. Theo? Well, he’s a lost soul who, as he grows up, acquires more than an ounce of sleaze himself. The locales are so disparate: Theo jumps from New York City to Las Vegas and back to New York again, with a horrifying visit to Amsterdam when he’s an adult. I read Tartt’s two earlier works and loved them, but that was a long time ago. Maybe now that I’m an old lady, time is too precious and I don’t want to waste it reading an 800-pager. Is Tartt’s language beautiful? Oh yes. Are her characters interesting and complex? Yes again. Can she create a complicated and far-out plot with a lot of twists and turns at the end? For sure. And her ability to paint a picture is magnificent. She’s one smart cookie.Okay, now for the bad news. Like Erdrich in “The Round House,” Tartt takes herself way too seriously. I’d say she’s a show-off, trying to impress us with her intellect instead of keeping the characters moving and talking. And even though I don’t expect to laugh with every book, a little levity would have been nice. It’s all deadly serious. And depressing as hell.And the scenery! Descriptions go on and on, forever! Although I admired her sometimes beautiful stream-of-consciousness, I won’t remember any of it—not the rooms or the streets or the furniture or the art. I require good dialogue and action in order to stay transfixed, and here they play second fiddle to descriptions. I especially hated how she analyzed paintings at the beginning of the book—it felt like Art History 101, where you get a detailed lecture on each person and thing in a painting. Yes, I “get the picture,” but I want to move out of the museum and into a conversation. And I completely resented the lessons in philosophy, which were particularly heavy at the end of the book. Okay, so she puts forth some brilliant ideas about good and evil, but I want the characters, not the author, to show it to us—the “show us, don’t tell us” rule of good writing.Tartt manages early on to get you hooked on Theo, but he makes such horrible choices it’s hard to keep rooting for him. And then there’s the question of whether he’s even a nice guy. I almost gave up on him (and the book) more than once. For a lot of people, it doesn’t matter whether heroes are “nice” or not, but for me, they have to be nice or else I don’t want to hang out with them for hours—and in this case, weeks and weeks. This monster book took me a month to finish. I never looked forward to curling up with this book; it was more like dread. Throw in a lot of frustration (get to the point already), annoyance (why is Theo making such stupid decisions?), and a big dose of anxiety (Help! How can Theo survive this mess he’s made for himself? Will the painting get ruined or lost forever?), and you end up with one big uncomfortable read. Though tempted many times, I didn’t abandon the book. I was hooked enough to want to find out how it ended. And I suspect I’ll remember this story (but not the endless descriptions) for a long while, and for that I’ll give it a 3. Just barely."

“A great sorrow, and one that I am only beginning to understand: we don’t get to choose our own hearts. We can’t make ourselves want what’s good for us or what’s good for other people. We don’t get to choose the people we are.”
 Donna Tartt publishes a book once every decade, or that's the pattern she's followed since her first book (published in 1992) and then her second (published in 2002) and now this (published in 2013). She's said she doesn't enjoy the process of creating a book in a faster manner and if she is not enjoying it then the reader won't either. If the outcome is always like this (and I say this, not having read her previews works) then I'll patiently wait a decade, a hundred years, if that's what I have to do in order to read a book of hers.I took my time with this book. I read it slowly, I didn't want to rush into it. Instead I focused on the writing, which is mouth-watering and at times I just couldn't help myself and read more than I initially intended to. I did not want this book to finish. This entire novel, it's a swirl of emotions. Emotions, feelings I can't even name. It was witty, it was deep, it was strange, it was bleak, it made me cry, it made me think about my life hard and take notes at what I have accomplished so far in. I was savoring the prose, I'd read each sentence twice just to make sure that it was embedded in a place somewhere in my mind. Beware, don't pick this expecting to find plot twists and action. Pick this up expecting to read a book with important life lessons. It's the realest of books. Mrs. Tartt composes characters and situations come alive from real life. Realistic prose and realistic people under realistic circumstances, it's what this book is. Shall I introduce you to the plot? Theodore Decker is a normal 13-year-old boy whose father has abondoned him and his mother, so, it's just the two of them together now. Add some tragedies. And a work of art. Browse slowly throughout Theo's life until his late teens and then fast forward to his adulthood. Mix in plenty of mistakes and rush decisions. A bleak and macabre atmosphere. Life lessons. Voila. I don't want to let you onto many details. I want you guys to pick this book up with no clue whatsoever and read it and then let your feelings sink in and your mind soak in the meaning underneath this incredible piece of literature. Let the characters come alive in your mind and let the writing take you to dark places where life isn't as happy as we think it is, at least not for everyone. It's such a powerful book. I will admit I was hesitant about reading this because I hadn't heard so many great things about it and reviews were mixed but I think people got into this prejudiced against the dark nature of the book, as it is indeed dark and it ventures into really twisted paths. Let me give you an advice. Free your mind of any kind of prohibition. Go into this book with a clear head off any kind of prejudice against what you think you know and understand. Don't read this unless you are going to do it so in the book's native language, meaning English. I've read numerous books in both English and my native language and I've noticed that things get lost in translation, countless details and of course an author loses their personal touch. This book is all about the writing, if you read a translated version of it then I fear it'll only give you a headache and a bad case of diarrhea. That's it. I don't know. I may return tomorrow, or in two months or in seven years to add something about what this book instilled in me because I'll make sure to carrie it along with me for a long time. "

I did it previously for Under the Dome by Stephen King, which made the experience all the more enjoyable and cinematic, and I started doing it around halfway through with The Goldfinch because frankly, I didn't enjoy the fact that I had to keep taking long breaks from reading while I was out and about or at work. Because I mean come on, this book is a beast and a bit too heavy to lug about. So here we are, I have finally completed my last Donna Tartt book. Did I enjoy it? Hell yes. Am I looking forward to her next release (probably at some point in my 30s)? Hell yes again.The Goldfinch isn't my favourite book of Tartt's that I've read so far, but I think it's fair to say that it's her most accomplished to date. After all, this is her most recent book, and it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2014. It is sweeping in its scale, a true coming-of-age tale that fans of that kind of book will probably lap up. The novel follows Theo Decker, a young boy who after a tragic accident loses his mother, and acquires an incredibly famous painting - The Goldfinch - in the process. From here we follow him as he narrates his life many years on, seeing his damaged childhood and the man that he will eventually become.I think it's best to leave things there with regards to a plot summary, because I think this book is best enjoyed with as little knowledge of the plot as possible. Also, word of warning, don't go on the wikipedia page - the first paragraph of the whole page, never mind the plot summary, will spoil later events for you. Yes, I was annoyed. It didn't ruin my experience per sé, but I definitely would have rather not known certain things.I thought Theo Decker was a very well-rounded character, and definitely a protagonist that you could both sympathise with and thoroughly dislike. He makes some terrible decisions, he treats people badly, but at the centre of it all he has a lot of heart, and cares and loves things and people incredibly deeply. I thought the pain he experienced through losing his mother was detailed incredibly well, and I truly felt for him as he navigated a variety of troubling experiences throughout his childhood. However, I think it's fair to say that it's not Theo Decker that makes this book - it's the secondary characters, his friends and companions through life. Boris is probably my favourite character in the whole book - sarcastic, passionate, caring, and a bit of a loose canon. He is also adorably Russian/Ukrainian/Australian... yeah, it makes sense when you read it. And then there is of course Hobie - I have a soft spot for older, slightly eccentric gentlemen, and Hobie fit the bill perfectly. I wanted him to be my dad pretty much, and I loved the audiobook narrator David Pittu's portrayal of him. As a character he warms your heart and makes you smile. Also, I think Popper/Popchik deserves a mention - what a cutie.There are definitely some serious themes covered in this book - bereavement, drug and alcohol abuse, gambling, and crime. I like all those things in books, because I am a bit on the miserable side, so if you like uplifting happy books, maybe this isn't the one for you. But if you want a literary fiction novel on the grand side of things, coming-of-age stories with less than likeable protagonists, and some truly great dialogue, then I think you will enjoy The Goldfinch. I'm definitely glad I finally got round to it."

Alas, this book was a disaster. A rambling, poetically incoherent mess to be exact.First, to all you folks that get huffy about reviews on books only partially read. I don't have to eat a whole meal to know I hate it, one bite makes me want to gag. I don't have to read every page to know I hate a book either.If I had to pick a book that literary snobs would place on their shelves as prime examples of 'quality writing', this would be the book I'd pick.I don't imply that only literature snobs like this book, but I've found they come out in droves to defend this drivel with stellar retorts like ""Ugh, obviously you should just read Reader's Digest"" or ""Weak minded readers with ADD might not like this"" or, my favorite ""You just don't understand the deeper meaning, you simple-minded fool."" Nope, I don't because I'm not digging through 700 pages of nicely written nonsense to find it.Would you like to read 14 pages about the smell and feel of the back seat of a taxi?

Ahh, the cosmos, so vast, so infinite, so lonely. Like the cicadas in the moonlight of my childhood home. Ah, my home, which brings only dark memories of my father. That wretch, now living on house-boat on the Thames, selling yo-yos to passing children. The yo-yo, so symbolic of life and death, yin and yang. It reminds me of the first time I had Chinese food in a small restaurant in Brooklyn. Brooklyn, the smell of hard work and dead leaves. Dead leaves, a subtle reminder of the finite, fragile lives we lead. Everything ends, everything dies, everything is silence. Like the silence of the bridge, which I head to.

102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6341226-cinzia-dubois,Rating 4 out of 5,"It’s been over six years since I read The Secret History and fell into the cult of Donna Tartt, but after reading The Little Friend by her, I was afraid to read The Goldfinch.⠀⠀Why? Well, because The Secret History is one of the best books ever written and The Little Friend is, by far, one of THE worst books ever written. It was so jarring to have two such drastic reading experiences, and while people told me not to worry about the Goldfinch, I held back for six years.  ⠀That being said, I’m so glad I finally got around to this book. It was an incredibly easy reading experience, and even when things suddenly felt a little tedious within a big book, Tartt would suddenly throw a major plot twist your way and keep you engaged the whole time. I don’t know how Tartt’s writing manages to keep the reader continuously invested the whole time — it’s an incredibly rare talent — and The Goldfinch showcases her skill magnificently. Is it as good as The Secret History? Not by a long shot. But is it an extremely interesting and enjoyable read? Absolutely. "

Theo, the main character, survives a catastrohic event and tries to put the pieces of his life back together, making many mistakes along the way. I related to him, his loss, his search for The Goldfinch, which connected him to his past and former unbroken life. Some of the writing was laborious, but the story was moving. Theo makes amends and knows he must keep moving forward, recognizing that everyone lives imperfect lives but must hold on to joyous memories. The author tell us ""that life-whatever it is-is short... immerse ourselves anyway; wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open."" I believe Theo did that."

105,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57003346-matthew-ted,Rating 5 out of 5,"70th book of 2020.On top of the standard thrill of finishing a nearly 900 page novel, there’s a rush of a lot more here: more than could ever be put into words in this review. As for buzzword themes, this novel has: Love, friendship, unrequited love, drugs, addiction, family, suffering, guilt, grief, mourning, affairs, criminals, gambling, mortality, history, parenthood, and of course, art... And probably more. But let’s start lightly, shall we? Dear PrudenceThe Beatles are my favourite band. My mother is a Scouser. I spent a lot of holidays up in Liverpool as a child. In fact, now is a good time to say how proud I am that several months ago Spotify informed me that out of the 20 million monthly listeners, I am in the top 1% in the world, for the amount of The Beatles listened. Is that impressive or do I need to branch out? Who Knows. Boris, one of my new favourite Tartt characters loves Dear Prudence which is also one of my top Beatles tracks (I have about forty ‘top’ tracks). And now, Dear Prudence  will forever remind me of Boris. I’d say most words I use to describe The Beatles: nostalgic, melancholic, hopeful, cathartic, broken-hearted…Well, they all apply here, too. Popper/Popchik/ Popchyk/PoustyshkaHaving now read all three of her novels (The Secret History review here/The Little Friend review here), this is now a slight ode to Tartt. As a child, she had memorised poems by A.A. Milne, then Poe, and now can recite T.S. Eliot and Dante. Her novels are often likened to Dickens – yes, they are Dickensian. The Observer regards The Goldfinch as a modern epic. Of course it is also called a masterpiece and a triumph. But Tartt, despite her success, is another mysterious/reclusive writer to add to the list with the likes of Pynchon, Salinger, Ferrante. There are many websites (of course) named things like – Uncovering Tartt, The Guide to Tartt, and, this one, which I’ve just made up now, The Secret Tartt (see what I did there?). As intrigued as I am about Tartt, I’m glad she’s mysterious. The little things I do know about her are enough. She’s done interviews, of course – I watched one after reading The Secret History and was surprised by the thickness of her Southern accent – but on the whole, she is largely out of the immediate ‘limelight’. Concerning The Goldfinch, I’ve read that she lived in New York hotels whilst writing it (almost ‘method’ writing) and that, like her other books, took her around ten years to write, which she thinks is the amount of time it takes to create. In fact, she said she began writing The Goldfinch around her first novel’s press tour – twenty years earlier. Because Tartt isn’t just creating a novel, she’s creating a universe; the world inside this book is as real as the world outside of it. Every character exploded into wonderful fruition, even Popper. We also know Tartt has a dog – pictured above – Pongo, who I hope is the very inspiration for Popper. ImmortalityThis book is about Theodore Decker, but its also about the painting, The Goldfinch, and it's also about life itself, and art itself. And despite these themes, which seem to fade away in the narrative at times, because we become so immersed in the characters and the plot, are actually there the whole time - bubbling under the surface. Tartt is gifted with the ability to write both a page turner, with beautiful language, and a literary masterpiece. It has taken me just over a week to read 864 pages. And though the pages flew by, the impact did not. Finally, rushing to the end of the novel, everything building towards its peak - everything behind you, is now on your back. You live Theo's life with him, and you carry everything he has with him, too. I wish I could say more about the ending, but I won't. It's not the end of the 'story' that got me, but the revelations. I wish I could put the characters in this book into words but I can't. Only by reading this, by living with them, will you understand. The GoldfinchThere's a lot more I want to say, but won't, or can't. I am now without another Tartt book to read, which saddens me a lot. Though, by her ten year standards, it might not be long. For those who have read this and enjoyed it, I expect you look at this little bird very differently. So, not only is Dear Prudence changed, but this painting too. So, bravo Tartt, a masterpiece. It's only fitting that this review is closed with the bird who started it all - chained, looking right at you. Wonder why he exists, why he is chained, and, what it says about Fabritius? Or even, you?"

Той представлява съвсем реалистична трагична история, но същевременно по вълнуващ сюрреалистичен начин разказва за въздействието на Изкуството върху човешкия живот. То наистина е явление, което придава смисъл и помага на човек по-добре да разбира себе си и другите хора, но и има своята тъмна страна, ако любовта към него се превърне в мания по притежаване на вещи.Обожавам стила на писане на Дона Тарт! След „Тайната история“, отново съм покорен от нейните разкошни описания и изключително стойностни мисли... Тези две чудесни книги имат доста разлики помежду си, но и общото непреходно послание, че търсенето единствено на красотата би могло да бъде разрушително, ако не е свързано и със смисъл.Главният герой Тио Декър има много тежко детство, след като майка му умира в терористично покушение над музей, от което той оцелява. Обаче, преди да се измъкне от сградата, той импулсивно краде и скрива прочутата картина „Щиглецът“. След това заживява временно или при семейството на съученика си Анди Барбър, както и успява да открие Хоуби и Пипа... Един ден пристига неговият баща (който ги е изоставил преди време), като го взима да живее при него и новата му жена в Лас Вегас, където се е преместил, тъй като вече е станал заклет комарджия. Впоследствие Тио значително пропада, започвайки да употребява наркотици и краде, заедно с приятеля му Борис.

Дори бях престанал да се опитвам да чета табелките с имената на улиците и да съхраня известна представа къде се намираме. От всичко около мен — от всичко, което можех да видя — единственото, което можеше да послужи за ориентир, беше луната, плуваща високо над облаците — но и тя, макар и ярка и пълна, кой знае защо изглеждаше някак нестабилна, лишена от тежест, не чистата, сигурна луна над пустинята, а по-скоро нещо като празничен светлинен ефект, който може да изгасне с натискането на един клавиш на компютъра или пък да отплува нанякъде в мрака и да изчезне от поглед.“„Но самият Уелти казваше, че у някои вещи има нещо съдбоносно. Всеки търговец на антики, всеки специалист ги разпознава. Вещите, които се връщат отново и отново. За някой друг, някой, който не търгува с такива вещи, тази роля може да не изпълнява вещ, а някой град, някой цвят, време на деня. Гвоздеят, на който може да се закачи и заплете тъканта на съдбата ти.“„Взирам се в неразбиращите лица на останалите пътници — мъкнещи куфарчета и раници, пристъпващи бавно към изхода на самолета — и мисля за онова, което каза Хоуби: красотата променя тъканта на реалността. Постоянно си спомням и една по-традиционна мъдрост — а именно че преследването на чистата красота е капан, най-прекият път към горчивината и скръбта, че красотата трябва да се съчетае с нещо по-смислено.“"
107,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Goldfinch contains multitudes. It’s the Dickensian coming-of-age tale of a hero much like David Copperfield who’s “possessed of a heart that can’t be trusted.” It’s a realist record of criminal escapades. It’s a story of unrequited love. It’s a convincing first-hand picture of anxiety, addiction and regret. It has a great road trip, an endearing small dog, and a last line that rivals The Great Gatsby’s. It’s a meditation on time, fate and the purpose of art.It’s not perfect, and yet I – even as someone who pretty much never rereads books – can imagine reading this again in the future and gleaning more with hindsight. That makes it worthy of one of my rare 5-star recommendations.[My pristine paperback copy cost all of £1 at a used bookshop.

And Theo was perhaps the most irritating and unlikeable character to get centre stage in such a long novel for many years…But you’ve got to hand it to Donna Tartt. The writing was inspired, the support cast of characters brilliant and the story riveting. "
109,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79606570-ethan,Rating 3 out of 5,"Caring too much for objects can destroy you. Only—if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn't it? And isn't the whole point of things—beautiful things—that they connect you to some larger beauty? Those first images that crack your heart wide open and you spend the rest of your life chasing, or trying to recapture, in one way or another? In Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Goldfinch, young Theo Decker's life is thrown into disarray and changed forever when his mother is killed in a terrorist bombing at a New York Museum. Theo manages to survive, and escapes the museum with Carel Fabritius' 1654 painting, which bears the same name as the novel. The book covers the immediate aftermath of the explosion and drifts into Theo's adult years, being something of a coming-of-age story in its scope. For me, this book was a very mixed bag, but did I like it or dislike it? Let's go over the positives and negatives. First, the positives: New York, New York One thing I never expected when I started reading The Goldfinch was that it would turn out to be a quintessential New York novel, but to me it is. I've read a number of New York based books over the years: Motherless Brooklyn by Jonathan Lethem, The New York Trilogy by Paul Auster, Falling Man and Underworld by Don DeLillo, to name a few, but I don't think I've come across a book that gave me as much of the New York vibe as this book did. Tartt actually lives in New York, and displays an extensive knowledge of its streets, businesses, museums, and etc. Sometimes it felt like she was just info dumping (street name, street name, theater name, etc.), but there were moments where she'd describe something seemingly insignificant like garbage cans, or the traffic noises, or a street vendor selling hot dogs, that really put me there and gave me the city ""vibe"". Boris and Mrs. Barbour Out of all the many characters in this book, two stood out to me: Boris and Mrs. Barbour. Boris brought humour and endless energy; he is flawed, and basically a criminal, but he always gave me the feeling that everything was going to be okay, no matter how bad things got for him and Theo. He had a naive self-confidence that I personally found endearing. Mrs. Barbour, on the other hand, is a very different character, cold and calculating but with a big heart, which was revealed in her constant shielded of a young Theo from the fallout of the attack. Of the two, Boris is the stronger character, and I would argue he is the only truly great character in the entire novel (sorry Hobie). Themes The themes covered in this book are seemingly infinite and deeply thought-provoking. Love, death, beauty. How none of us ever get what we really want in life. Fate, destiny, fortune, chance, heredity and its impact on who we become. Friendship, morality, brotherhood. Grief, loss, heartbreak. Tartt explores a wide range of fascinating and powerful themes in this novel, and she's incredibly brave for doing so, as many of them are not easy ground to cover. Cultivated investment Donna Tartt made me care about and really look forward to seemingly trivial things in this book that many would find boring, like when Theo met Mrs. Barbour again after many years away from their family. I really looked forward to that conversation, and Tartt's cultivation of such an investment in the story proves that she is a great writer. That covers the good. But what about the bad? Nonsensical story points Some aspects of story simply don't make sense. The father left Theo and his mother a year ago or more, and there was mention that money was tight, and that the father wasn't paying any kind of support to them...but they can somehow afford to live in a downtown New York apartment with white gloved doormen? And there's mention that the mother has numerous bottles of ""overpriced"" shampoo in the bathroom. How can she afford them? And Kitsey, whose every action paints her as a vain, conceited, empty-headed imbecile. But Tartt later on goes to lengths in numerous different scenes of dialogue to explicitly state how intelligent Kitsey is? She sounds like a character from Keeping Up with the Kardashians to me, so how is she simultaneously this highly intelligent person? It's completely incongruous. Early on in the book, Theo also seems way too grown up, like Tartt wanted to write an adult character but her story called for a teenager because it was a coming-of-age narrative. He does really mature things that no thirteen year old would do, like buying and sending his mother flowers on her birthday. Are you kidding me? I didn't have my own money until I was sixteen and had my first job. Where did he get the money for it? He doesn't even have a job. Flowers from a florist aren't cheap. Also just the way he talks and conducts himself. He's clearly mature well beyond his years, which to me didn't make a whole lot of sense and wasn't very unrealistic. And the story Boris weaves to describe his years away from Theo, when they finally meet again in New York, is absolutely ridiculous and similarly unrealistic. Multiple kids at his high school going into rehab? What the hell...kids in high school are like fourteen? Is America really so messed up that fourteen year old kids in high school are using cocaine and going into rehab en masse? And Boris ended up working for the guy who was coming to the Vegas house with a henchman who had a baseball bat, looking for Theo's dad so he could ""extract"" the money he owes him? Seriously? That's the last person on Earth he'd end up working for in real life. It's a ridiculous, nonsensical tale, and it took me completely out of the story. And what about the henchmen, who have twenty thousand dollar watches, or how Theo, a furniture salesmen, can somehow afford to buy Pippa a thirty thousand dollar necklace. Donna Tartt is aware these are enormous sums of money, right? And that no shifty, small-time, underworld henchman from Amsterdam would ever be able to afford a watch anywhere near that valuable, right? Apparently she does not. She might as well have made it a one hundred thousand dollar watch; it would have been just as ridiculous. Enormous chapter sizes The chapters in this book are insanely large, with some actually being over 100 pages long (one, at 169 pages, was 17.5% of the book's entire length). This, to me, is cruel and unusual punishment. The weird text messaging On numerous occasions in this book, characters text message each other on their mobile phones, and this texting is incredibly strange. It's as if Tartt thinks text messages for some reason have a 30 character limit or something; characters were constantly cutting their words down and eliminating letters, substituting in numbers instead, or just cutting the letters out with no substitutions so the words were sometimes almost indecipherable. I'm fairly certain that no one on Earth texts this way, and I thought it was just bizarre. Repetition This book is unbelievably repetitive, and in numerous different ways: Everyone always talking over the other person in dialogue, it was always raining (no matter which country the story was taking place in; there were two different ones), dialogue with one word (it was often the same three or four words throughout the novel, ad nauseum) and then an emdash, for example: ""Um—""""I—""""Well—""""Because—"" Theo never eating anything or only eating a few bites of an entire meal, like he never has an appetite or has a condition or something, neverending Dickens references, hundreds (thousands?) of silences and instances of staring awkwardly at the other person in conversational dialogue between characters. Donna Tartt took over ten years to write this novel; how could she possibly not be aware the book was this repetitive, and not revise it to eliminate hundreds of instances of the above repetitions? They were glaringly obvious to me after probably less than a hundred pages, and this book is almost a thousand pages long. For someone who claims to do extensive editing herself, this is simply inexcusable on Donna Tartt's part and, quite frankly, is baffling. Theo and Pippa Theo's obsession with Pippa was endearing at first, given their unique and lifelong bond with each other, but it later became increasingly creepy and incredibly pathetic.  The sheer and utter collapse of the story The early New York section at the beginning of the book, and the Vegas section, were well done, but when Theo comes back to New York after Vegas the story goes to hell; the story slows to a crawl and depicts incredibly boring events, like carousing in bars and shopping for weddings. Long, tedious dinner and barroom conversations spanning many pages, filled with vapid, boring dialogue. It almost seemed like an entirely different author wrote the second half of the book. The protagonist This is supposed to be Theo's story, but the supporting characters left a lot bigger impact on me than Theo, who I found to be a very bland, lifeless character that I didn't care about in the slightest. The insane amount of drug and alcohol use Enough said. I can only read characters consuming copious amounts of alcohol and various types of hard drugs so many times before it starts to sicken me. And it probably happened hundreds of times in this book. The length There's no two ways about it: this book is at least 200 pages too long. Segments of 10-20 pages of Theo and Boris just drinking in a bar, 40 pages of Theo moping and worrying in his Amsterdam hotel about what happened to Boris, the 20 page philosophical rant at the very end of the book, and so much more...it just didn't need to be there. This book needed some serious editing, and never should have been published at anywhere near this length. The ending The ending was very disappointing: a dense, barely readable, over-thinking analysis of the painting and its meaning, several lazy, two-or-three sentence blurbs mentioning major characters and storylines, like the Barbours or Pippa's relationship with Theo, characters and storylines you've just spent almost a thousand pages with, only to have their stories left unresolved and underexplored by the end of the book, and a boring, self-contradicting narrative about how life sucks and it's better never to have been born, but you can be happy and enjoy life? Huh?In conclusion, Donna Tartt's The Goldfinch is sometimes hailed as an epic masterpiece of sweeping scope, but I thought it was more like Howard Hughes' plane, the Spruce Goose. It's impressive in a way, and incredibly heavy, and it can take off and briefly soar, but it's ultimately flawed, crashing back down under its immense weight (or, in this case, its length). It was enjoyable at times, but I was disappointed overall, and will likely never go back to it in the future. That being said, Donna Tartt is clearly a skilled writer, and I look forward to reading her other books, all of which I've already purchased."

I wanted to love this book, I included it in my 5-star predictions video, that's how much I thought I was going to love it. I gave this book several tries, I read 300 pages of it and I just can't do it anymore. I'm bored out of my mind. This story follows a young boy named Theo who becomes an orphan suddenly and his life gets completely thrown off it's course because of it. The book started off interesting enough, with the dramatic scenes of how Theo became an orphan. Then, after the 100 page mark this book falls into this sluggish drag and it becomes the kind of book that will take twenty pages to describe the most mundane details about everything that you don't give a shit about.Even though this book relies on you to feel something for Theo, I didn't care about his character. I don't know why, I just never connected to his character. All of the characters in this book feel that way - so distant, like you can't really connect with any of them. By page 300 with all the scenes of him and Boris in Vegas I was so bored out of my mind I decided to stop reading it. Life it too short to finish 700 page books that I am not enjoying. So there's that, I'm disappointed. I guess Donna Tartt books are just not my thing. "
111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,Rating 5 out of 5,"***NO SPOILERS***“...You must risk placing real emotion at the center of your work. Write straight into the emotional center of things. Write toward vulnerability. Risk being unliked. Tell the truth as you understand it. If you’re a writer you have a moral obligation to do this. And it is a revolutionary act—truth is always subversive.”--Anne LamottThe best fiction reveals hard truths. Readers seeking sugar-coated fiction should move along; not a grain of sugar can be found in Donna Tartt’s gutsy The Goldfinch, a shining example of literary fiction at its most resonant. Tartt’s no-holds-barred depiction is the furthest thing from sanitized, yet--a big yet--it contains hope, love, and redemption, and more than mere glimmers of those. There are numerous characters to be riveted by, love, and even laugh at. But it simply cannot be denied that hard truth overflows in this bold work: coarse, detailed descriptions of copious drug use and alcoholism; instances of physical abuse and regular cursing. In its depiction of one boy’s life of yearning, despair, and utter loneliness following his mother’s death, this almost-800 page book is as real as any book gets. The book begins when protagonist Theo is thirteen and covers the events of his life over many years, ending when he is somewhere in his mid-to-late twenties. In this way it is a kind of “pseudo-coming-of-age story.” Compelling characters, realistic and plentiful dialogue, and a sustained low-level of suspense (ratcheted higher at points) translate to a gripping page-turner. Added to that are some genuine shocks, plus at least one huge twist, that guarantee this book will be a memorable one. Theo is unmoored after his mother’s death, never truly finding his footing in life, though stumbling through worse at some times than at others. The Goldfinch is striking on countless levels, not least of which is its stunningly authentic portrayal of bereavement:How was it possible to miss someone as much as I missed my mother? I missed her so much I wanted to die: a hard, physical longing, like a craving for air underwater. Lying awake, I tried to recall all my best memories of her--to freeze her in my mind so I wouldn’t forget her--but instead of birthdays and happy times I kept remembering things like how a few days before she was killed she’d stopped me halfway out the door to pick a thread off my school jacket.[...]It kept being a shock every time I remembered it, a fresh slap: she was gone. Every new event--everything I did for the rest of my life--would only separate us more and more: days she was no longer a part of, an ever-growing distance between us. Every single day for the rest of my life, she would only be further away.Ultimately, the book is a fearless examination of what happens in the aftermath of a devastating loss. However, despite the main character’s cynical outlook and continuous struggle with depression, the book itself is not depressing. Possibly this is because enough of The Goldfinch’s other characters act as a calming counterbalance. Every character in this book rings true-to-life--distinct and dynamic, very much alive. They run the gamut; there are the gentle and virtuous to love, the villainous to hate, and the struggling to root for. One exceedingly wealthy way of life contrasts glaringly with another that is painfully down-and-out. Only the deftest of writers can infuse these portrayals with the complexity and nuance necessary for them to ring true. Tartt more than succeeded here. She has an astonishingly keen eye for detail, and her descriptive talent is nothing short of jolting:She had black hair, fair skin that freckled in summer, china-blue eyes with a lot of light in them; and in the slant of her cheekbones there was such an eccentric mixture of the tribal and the Celtic Twilight that sometimes people guessed she was Icelandic. In fact, she was half Irish, half Cherokee, from a town in Kansas near the Oklahoma border; and she liked to make me laugh by calling herself an Okie even though she was as glossy and nervy and stylish as a racehorse. That exotic character unfortunately comes out a little too stark and unforgiving in photographs—her freckles covered with makeup, her hair pulled back in a ponytail at the nape of her neck like some nobleman in The Tale of Genji--and what doesn’t come across at all is her warmth, her merry, unpredictable quality, which is what I loved about her most. It’s clear, from the stillness she emanates in pictures, how much she mistrusted the camera; she gives off a watchful, tigerish air of steeling herself against attack. But in life she wasn’t like that. She moved with a thrilling quickness, gestures sudden and light, always perched on the edge of her chair like some long elegant marsh-bird about to startle and fly away. Such striking characterization will not come as a surprise to fans of Tartt’s The Secret History, her first book and a masterpiece in its own right, though different from The Goldfinch in nearly every way.Typical for Tartt is to take several years to write one book. The Secret History took her eight years to write; The Little Friend took a bit longer--ten years, and the same is true of The Goldfinch. That slow-and-steady effort more than paid off; her exquisitely fluid prose is truly some of the best, somehow seeming even more impressive when one considers the glut of forgettable “quick-money” books jamming today’s bookstore shelves. The hardcover book even feels like a work of art itself; the font and cover art is elegant and clean, and the pages have a satin-like quality. Additionally, as with Tartt’s other books, The Goldfinch has wide appeal. Unfortunately, the story isn’t without flaw. Although it does conclude on a satisfying note, with an excellent sense of closure, its final ten or so pages are its weakest. Here Tartt veered into a rambling, sometimes overly abstract lecture that seems, more than anything, to be her personal musings on the connection between art and life. Why this section is necessary is a mystery when her story has already driven home this point. This section could have been shortened by at least half with no loss, if not removed altogether. Tartt masterfully “showed” and didn’t “tell” throughout The Goldfinch, yet here she did the exact opposite, and the result makes for some boring reading. Nevertheless, this is the one and only misstep in an otherwise supreme five-star work and hardly reason to dismiss it.

112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,Rating 4 out of 5,"Thirteen-year-old Theo Decker's life changes dramatically when he and his mother stop by the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the way to a conference at Theo's school.While browsing the gallery Theo spots an elderly gentleman (Welty) escorting a teenage girl (Pippa) with whom Theo is instantly enthralled. Shortly afterward a terrorist bomb levels part of the museum, Theo's mom is killed, and Theo - shocked and confused - makes off with a small masterpiece, Carel Fabritius's painting ""The Goldfinch"". Theo's deep mourning over the loss of his mother, his illicit possession of the beautiful masterpiece, and his infatuation with the badly injured Pippa profoundly affect his ongoing story. I don't think the next section of my review is too spoilery but I'm adding a spoiler alert in case potential readers want minimal information. Theo temporarily moves into the home of his wealthy best friend, Andy Barbour - who has eccentric parents and resentful siblings. He also makes the acquaintance of Welty's partner, James Hobart (Hobie), a furniture restorer and antique dealer who teaches Theo the trade. After a short time Theo's irresponsible, alcoholic, gambling-addicted father shows up with his girlfriend Xandra and they whisk Theo off to live in an isolated house in the Las Vegas desert. Here Theo meets his friend for life, the Ukrainian Boris - and the two boys embark on a lifestyle of stealing, drinking, taking drugs, and blowing off school. When Theo's dad dies in a car crash Theo (and Xandra's neglected dog Popper) make their way back to New York and move in with Hobie. Theo - now a drug and alcohol addict - eventually partners with Hobie in the antique shop. Needing funds for the business Theo proceeds to cheat wealthy clients by selling some of Hobie's creations as genuine antiques. In time Theo, his love for Pippa unrequited, tries to move on romantically. He also gets involved with blackmailers, gangsters, and art thieves, all of which leads to the climax of the story.  To me the very last part of the book - where the author philosophizes about art and beauty and life - was slow and somewhat incomprehensible. For the most part, though, this is an excellent book with a good story, well-rounded, engrossing characters and enough twists to keep the reader interested.You can follow my reviews at https://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot...."

All I wanted to do for the first week after finishing this book was lay around and think about The Goldfinch and its vivid settings and intricate characters. I've read several reviews where people use the word ""Dickensian"" to describe this novel. Having only read A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens in high school and absolute despising it, I'm not sure I feel comfortable tossing that word around in relation to Tartt's most recent novel. I will say, however, that while many critics found the story to be unbelievable and long-winded at times, I thought it was nothing short of riveting and wouldn't have minded another few chapters, even if they were only about Kitsey Barbour. Don't knock this one off your TBR until you've given it a good, solid go.

Donna Tartt is not out to prove a new, quirky, literary format (well, she does play with us a bit in the last chapter). The Goldfinch is solid and traditional. She unwraps a story in which one moment’s action spirals into a lifetime of anxiety and paranoia and the protagonist (Theo) embarks on a journey of self-identity. In the midst of dark, dreary, and hopeless New York and Amsterdam settings, Tartt inserts endearing moments - Boris reunites with Popchik, Theo is nicknamed Potter, Hobie schools Theo on furniture reconstruction.Tartt ends with a profound statement about the mystery of life and beautiful thoughts on art. The Goldfinch has found the “rainbow edge where beauty comes into being, where two very different surfaces mingle and blur to provide what life does not: and this is the space where all art exists, and all magic.”.I have been spoiled by Tartt’s other masterpiece, The Little Friend, but I’m still giving this a 5 star."

“You can look at a picture for a week and never think of it again. You can also look at a picture for a second and think of it all your life.”
 There is an odd beauty to Donna Tartt’s writing. Having read her debut novel The Secret History, I expected something similar in terms of poignant diction and compelling morally grey characters. While The Secret History keeps its title as one of my favourite standalone novels (and my favourite of Tartt’s) it cant be denied that I really enjoyed The Goldfinch as well.
~★~ What is this book about? ~★~
While visiting an art gallery, Theo Decker and his mother fall victim to a terrorist attack. Theo survives, and in memory of his mother steals one of her favourite paintings, The Goldfinch. As time goes by, Theo cycles through homes feeling lost and without purpose. The painting is the only thing left that connects him to his mother, and giving it up is not an option. Years later Theo discovers people he isn't willing to lose, but the threat of his crime being discovered grows closer with every day that passes by.~★~Contemplating how to start this review was a nightmare. I’ve just burned through Theo’s very lengthy life story, and my thoughts are still racing with the aftershocks. A seven-hundred-seventy page story is no small feat, especially considering that The Goldfinch contains eleven years worth of work.Something I adore about Donna Tartt as an author is her way of maintaining a slight degree of detachment between readers and the protagonist. You may be wondering, “doesn’t that take away from the story?” and I’d tell you no; for me it only enhances the impact.Despite being narrated in first person, Theo himself seems but a small detail in the grand scheme of things. His thoughts shape the story’s direction, yes, though it is the atmosphere paired with the people surrounding Theo that make things genius. These integral characters and their proceedings quickly become oh so compelling to the point where it is their lives you hope to follow. (I could read stories upon stories about Boris and Hobie, truly).
“I had the epiphany that laughter was light, and light was laughter, and that this was the secret of the universe.”
There’s something about Tartt’s writing that is unparalleled by any other author I’ve read from. This woman must be a damn magician—never in my life did I think I’d become desperately invested in the state of a little antique shop. If Donna writes about how to properly restore a chair, you’ll feel the wood scraping your palms, picking up details of the craft. If she wants to write about sailing the vast ocean, you’ll feel the breeze caressing your face and the saltwater spraying your lips. Her imagery adds an incredible atmosphere I wont even bother attempting to articulate.
“Caring too much for objects can destroy you. Only—if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn’t it? And isn’t the whole point of things—beautiful things—that they connect you to some larger beauty?""
In english class this year, our teacher allowed us to write our final essays analyzing a novel of our choice. It’s typical that when annotating is involved, I end up enjoying a story a whole lot less than I would have being if able to read freely. Somehow that wasn’t the case at all here. I’d been planning to read The Goldfinch anyways, and went in knowing Tartt’s writing style is something I’m fond of. This is a slow book, as are her others, which is important to consider before jumping into this story. Otherwise, the pulitzer prize speaks for itself; several people out there have found meaning in this story. Maybe you’ll be one of them."

Τελικά, καταλήγω, καλό είναι να χρησιμοποιούμε την εμπειρία μας - τίποτα δεν ανταπεξέρχεται σε αυτόν τον απρόβλεπτο μηχανισμό καλλιέργειας προσμονών.Κρίνοντας το βιβλίο απεκδυόμενο τις στεφάνες του, αναρωτιέμαι γιατί γράφονται τόσο μεγάλα βιβλία. Στη σύγχρονη λογοτεχνία υπάρχει μια τάση ο όγκος να συνάδει με μια παράξενη αρχιτεκτονική του συγγραφέα που δεν εξυπηρετεί μια ιστορία που δεν μπορεί να υποθεί σε λιγότερες σελίδες, αλλά αποδίδει την σύγχυση του σύγχρονου ανθρώπου. Ίσως ο σταυρός που κουβαλάει ο πολύπλοκος σύγχρονος άνθρωπος σε σχέση με τον πιο αμαθή, αρχαίο, να χρειάζεται πολλές ""γραμμές"" για να αποτυπωθεί επαρκώς. Ωστόσο, εγώ βγάζω το καπέλο στην Ταρτ, για το θάρρος της να εμφανίζεται κάθε δέκα χρόνια, με απαιτητικά έργα, που σπάνια συναντάμε στον καιρό μας. Στην αρχή η εμβρίθειά της στην εξιστόρηση φαντάζει σπαστική. Μα ουδέποτε κουράζει. Με λίγη υπομονή, το μεγάλο πλάνο μιας μεγάλη ιστορίας ξεδιπλώνεται στον αναγνώστη, ο οποίος έρχεται σε επαφή με τον καταπληκτικό ήρωα, σαρκαστικό, μα ποτέ εξυπνάκια, και τον θίασο που τον συνοδεύει, καθώς ενηλικιώνεται, στις κακουχίες του, στις περιπέτειες και τα δράματά του. Πασπαλισμένα με το απαραίτητο χιούμορ. Η γλώσσα δε -μαζί με αυτήν την εξαιρετική μετάφραση- είναι κάτι πρωτόγνωρο για εμένα. Ουδέποτε πέφτει σε λογιοτατισμούς, πολλές φορές χρησιμοποιεί σύγχρονη, σπιρτόζικη, άλλοτε προφορική προσέγγιση. Μα πάντα καταφέρνει να στέκεται σε υψηλότατο επίπεδο, βασισμένο σε ένα άκρως απαιτητικό λεξιλόγιο.Το βιβλίο είναι μεγάλο, επικό σχεδόν, πλούσιο. Και χαρίζει κάτι που σπάνια συναντώ πια: χαρακτήρες με τους οποίους δένεσαι. Σε αυτό συντελεί και η αναγνωστική διάρκεια μα και η εξαιρετική λεπτομέρεια στην σκιαγράφηση. Τελικά το όλον δένει στο τέλος. Αναπάντεχα διδακτικά, αλλά αν��πόφευκτα, με συγγραφική συνέπεια, αιτιολογώντας την ύπαρξη αυτού του γραπτού.θα αρέσει στους βιβλιόφιλους. Όχι σε όλους, μα σε αυτούς που αναπολούν μια λογοτεχνία που χάνεται. Ψήγματα αυτής βρίσκονται μέσα στις σελίδες της Καρδερίνας. Για αυτόν τον λόγο, για την εξαιρετικά λογοτεχνική του ταυτότητα θα του βάλω 5 αστέρια. Είναι 5 αστέρια δικά του. Όχι όμως των προσδοκιών, της φήμης και των θορυβωδών επαίνων."
118,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3010986-amanda-patterson,Rating 1 out of 5,"I was expecting so much from this novel. After all, Donna Tartt only writes a novel every so often.Where to start? There is so much wrong with this mess of a book. It is too long. It has a weak, reactive protagonist for whom I felt no empathy. Theo is pitiable and unlikeable, and worst of all, he does not change. None of the characters do. It was as if I were reading a reality show full of awful characters I would not want to meet in real life, and like reality television, nothing much happens for most of the 800 pages. A major problem is also Theo’s voice. I could hear the author trying to force a male viewpoint. It didn’t work.The story starts off with a bang – literally. Theo’s mother is killed in an explosion in an art gallery in New York. His alcoholic father has recently abandoned them. Theo, at the time, has been suspended from school, and is already a petty criminal. He survives the explosion and somehow manages to steal a priceless painting as he exits the building. Theo’s life, and the story, goes from bad to worse and back to bad. There are so many unnecessary characters and irrelevant situations that I would bore you senseless describing them. If you’re willing to risk reading this wad of paper to find out who they are, good luck. I read all the way to the end, desperately hoping for Theo to display some character. I was disappointed."
119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,Rating 4 out of 5,"Thirteen-year-old New Yorker, Theo Decker, lost his mother in an explosion in an art museum. He becomes a candidate for foster care since his father abandoned them a few years earlier. Thus begins his journey through the world of the wealthy and influential players in society, the middle-class dicey world of his dad, the lonely world of abandoned abused friends he finds in unlikely places. Through it all he clings to his memories of his mother and a painting of the little bird which his mother adored. The painting would become her. In protecting it, he also subconsciously protected the dreams his mother had for him. It became his direct line of communication with her. The last time a book caused such a buzz in my little world, was when Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt hit the stage. Everybody, who took reading seriously, excitedly bounced up and down urging the rest of mankind to read it. Dan Brown and J. K Rawling changed everything with their versions of best sellers after that, although I was always of the opinion that they used the unique or the shocking to attract readers. There was just something about these books that captured a much wider audience than was initially targeted. It did not matter where you were, in which country, the books were part of everyone's luggage, or visible book collections on coffee tables. Friends became foes when one loved it and the other did not. I am not sure if Tartt's book will equal anything like the above-mentioned book sales, ever, but did manage to create quite a stir in a very short time in the company of bibliophiles and became a best seller simply by word of mouth alone. It almost did not need an aggressive promotional force behind it. This book sells itself. I did not want to read this book. As in *was not interested in reading it*. Simply because I did not like the mass hysterics it created. I bought Dan Brown's books and gave it away as soon as I read the first one. First time that has ever happened. I simply refused to read any Harry Potters. I also bought other Pulitzer Prize Winners and wish I had not. There was really nothing wrong with the books at all. I simply was not the right target audience for it. Books that are based on reality, deal with the truth in some or other form, or convincingly represent humanity, are the books I feel comfortable with. It helps when some sort of character represents me in the tale as well. Someone I can relate to. And if that is impossible, I appreciate it if I can at least relate to the story. Goodreads friends convinced me with their honest reviews to give this book a shot. It really was a good read. Donna Tartt is a real storyteller. She used fairytale elements to attract a serious younger crowd to a book about their reality. Her inclusion of sights and sounds, silences and smells, as well as capturing the imagination with her descriptive prose on the ambiance of their environment, brought more than a rainbow of color to the tale. Informative, detailed, well-written indeed. The suspense and adventure enabled her to expose the challenges of the modern world without losing her readers in the process. The text is undoubtedly rich. Beautiful.What bothered me?1) I could not identify with any of the characters; 2) the milieu was toxic, yet necessary for the plot, and sadly representative of the world as we know it right now. 3) The idea was too fantastic (for my taste), quite similar to the Dan Brown books, but with way less violence and horror. It cannot be compared to Dan Brown's books, of course, simply because it was written with much more dignity and grace, in the first place. The aim of the book was quite different. It did not use controversial elements to attract attention. It did not try to shock at all. The Goldfinch addressed reality but at the same time turned it into a fairy tale without compromising the truth of society too much. 4) The length was unnecessary, it could lose at least 150 pages. The lectures and philosophical jigsaw puzzle could have been edited out, however, she made an effort to develop every single character and change perceptions of stereotypical personalities by stretching the story out over so many additional pages. It brought balance in a way, but it still could have been shortened. 5) Speaking of which: There was some philosophical, preachy word-dumping taking place, yet I found the information about the antique furniture fascinating. But I did skip too many pages in the end where 'show don't tell' lost out to passive thoughts instead of actions. It killed the ending.6) The characters did the opposite of what I wanted them to do. Drugs and alcohol abuse were just too much, repetitive, neverending. At one point I thought the book read like a soapie. Nobody dared to be happy, it will destroy the reason for continuing the tale. It took almost 800 pages to conclude the saga after all! The characters were repulsive as well as endearing. They touched me mentally and emotionally even though I did not want that to happen!There are other discrepancies, like mentioning the use of email and cell phones which did not quite fit the time frame of the story, as well as confusing routes between Las Vegas and New York which even looked suspect to me who have never been there. I just allowed it to slide for the greater good. But it does leave some question marks about the authenticity of the text though. I was also wondering what the author's own experiences with drugs were.The book did not shock. Nothing in it was new. What I did appreciate was the multi-leveled issues addressed. It was as though the author dragged a canvas over modern society, switched on the spotlight and presented our own dark inner world to ourselves. She highlighted the people behind the veneer. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Shakespeare said it well:  "" All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages."" I would not call it a favorite. But I will certainly recommend it as a good read. Donna Tartt knows how to construct as well as tell a story in well-executed prose. Minimalism was the key in sentence building. The story had an easy flow. I was surprised that I never really had the urge to constantly skip-read a lot of it, although I had to encourage myself to keep reading. But towards the end I skipped the moral lectures and headed for the goal posts. But good heavens, what happened to the ending? I felt like dropping the ball since I couldn't find the goal posts! EDIT: Another reviewer(calling her/himself 'Longhare'on GR) summed up the ending like this:
""So much of this book was messy, underdeveloped, convenient, and unlikely--and then at the end, she takes all 800 pages and starts pounding the reader over the head with it. This is why Woods compares it with children's lit. Tartt, lets too much of the hard work go (an un-Hobie-like approach to her craft) and then incredibly, falls into the trap of wanting to explain to her readers what she meant--in case they needed help figuring it out. Ouch, Donna.""
 That is exactly how I felt after closing the book. The author failed the ending by doing this!I just wanted a more structured, more 'happier' ending after all the hardship and trauma. But then it would have deceived the reality, right? Optimism. I so wanted the good to triumph! Alas, it would then not have been considered for the Pullitzer Prize. I get that. But still !The story just faded out. Who knows where the ending went!? I did not fall in love with the book, but could not stop reading it either. I was left elated as well as sad. There was just something keeping me yearning for more and more, although I constantly wanted to turn my back on it as well! And if I think back, I realized that nobody was a villain or a hero. They were all just depressingly human, like you and me. Skillfully written. Masterful prose. Certainly one of the better reads this year. I am glad I bought it. But I did close it with mix feelings reigning me in. I need to consider why. "
120,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25309949-lotte,Rating 4 out of 5,"Loved the process of half-reading my physical copy, half-listening to the unabridged audiobook version of this book. Since I'm very interested in translations, it was especially cool to read the original English version and then listen to the German translation. It definitely made for a very unique reading experience! When it comes to reviewing the actual book itself, I think I'll have to think about it for a bit longer before I can give any coherent opinions. Just know that while I did think it was a bit pretentious at times, Theo's narration and the writing style ultimately managed to suck me into the story and into this world, and I'd definitely recommend the book as a whole!"
121,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26424937-lori,Rating 4 out of 5,"A book that was maddening, but that had me on my feet (literally) at a particular section at the end where she beautifully captures the meaning of art itself. Bless Donna Tartt for undertaking a true modern epic, one that evokes Dickens (which has gotten all the attention) but even moreso, structurally and in theme and scope, Proust. Proust is so all over this novel that it was a relief when she finally mentioned him; the book is structured like a symphony in the same way ""In Search of Lost Time"" is. I applaud her scope and detail; the ten years she took to write it show. Still, there are long passages that drag, are overwritten, overly long. But the end of this book is so satisfying and beautiful it makes the journey worth it.Her prose is neither as elegant as Proust's nor as brisk as Dickens and that makes it a tough read. But the heart of the story -- the painting and the meditations on art -- is beautiful and ultimately make the sometimes uphill climb all worth it at the end. Do I wish she had written this book differently? Very much. But the book she has written is so unique and delicate of sensibility, and so respectful and loving of art itself that I love it flaws and all."
122,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34428697-joanne-harris,No Rating,"A truly marvellous book - engaging from the start, and as dark, twisted and emotionally challenging as all Donna Tartt's novels. It's very long, and some might think too long - filled with details and vignettes that seen not to contribute to the plot - but reading a book like this for the plot is mostly counter-intuitive. You read this novel, if you read it, for the whole tapestry, messy and gorgeous as it is, and its length, and the time it takes to tell, are a necessary part of the whole. There are a couple of details I jibbed at - a killer plot device near the end; a few too many co-incidences - but those things are minor details in a work of incredible richness and fluidity. The last few pages contain not only the most gorgeous passages of writing I've come across in ages, but delivers in a few pages the thematical heart of the whole book - a whammy as powerful in its way as the last page of ""Wuthering Heights"", and as redemptive. Not everyone will enjoy this one - don't look for characters to aspire to, or uplifting moral messages in here - but as an insight into the nature of bereavement, guilt, yearning and the sublime transience of beauty, this has got to be one of the greats."
123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3303083-sheila-beaumont,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow, what a brilliant, immersive page-turner this was! It took me a while to get around to reading it, but I decided to ignore the naysayers and finally read the thing. And I'm so glad I did! It's a coming-of-age story, a character-driven mystery/thriller, and a beautifully written meditation on art, fate, love, loss, and grief.There are so many vividly portrayed characters: young Theo Decker (who is telling the story), Pippa, Mrs. Barbour, Kitsey, and Hobie. And my favorite, the amazing Boris, sort of an Eastern European Artful Dodger who alone is reason enough to read this long Dickensian novel.I would give this wonderful book 10 stars if I could! "
124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39755-eb,Rating 4 out of 5,"What I like most about Tartt is her love of detail. Clothes, furniture, light, cheekbones—she describes her fictional world more clearly than I see my real one. Her pacing is desultory, to put it mildly, but she's capable of writing scenes so gripping and suspenseful that they're hard to get through (that part when Theo's on the phone with his lawyer, and his dad's listening on the extension! It's SO GOOD!).The Goldfinch reminds me of The Art of Fielding, in that it's almost completely disconnected from the real world; both novels read like fairy tales. Tartt acknowledges the existence of smart phones and Facebook, but all of her characters, including teenage American boys, talk like they just stepped out of Dickens (""We're in a bit of a tip,"" ""What shall I do?"" ""I'm all out of sorts""), and her depiction of Manhattan is so rosy and strange it reminded me of From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. If you loved the preppiness and privilege of The Secret History, you'll be happy to encounter reams of boat shoes, antiques, and brittle blondes here. If you have no patience for that world, you might like the swath of the novel set in sun-scorched, trashy Vegas. If you enjoyed the menace of TSH, you'll be pleased with the deaths that pile up in these pages. If you found TSH callow in its treatment of murder, you'll be happy to find that Tartt has grown more comfortable with real emotion. "
125,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7091879-stepheny,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have thought long and hard about this book and what I could possibly say about it that could even remotely do it justice. I finished this book weeks ago and I still find myself reflecting back on it. A true piece of literature like The Goldfinch will leave you in contemplation. I can honestly say it is one of the best books I have ever read in my life and put it in the ranks of To Kill a Mockingbird. Donna Tartt has created a masterpiece here. I cannot stress that enough. This book is both thought provoking and profound. There is a truth in her writing that spoke to me in ways other books can’t. I will admit it was extremely difficult for me to read at times because the main character loses a parent and I lost my father a mere two weeks before picking this book up. I had to put the book down several times to let the tears pass before I was able to pick it up again. I felt that someone truly knew how I felt and understood my grief in a way that no one else did. Yet another sign of a great writer is writing with emotional accuracy. “But sometimes, unexpectedly, grief pounded over me in waves that left me gasping; and when the waves washed back, I found myself looking out over a brackish wreck which was illumined in a light so lucid, so heartsick and empty, that I could hardly remember that the world had ever been anything but dead.” Tartt’s prose is a form of art all in itself. You can tell that she carefully placed each word and took her time writing this novel. It is a long book- 771 pages- but every word serves its purpose and made this book the masterpiece that it is.The characters are unforgettable and you will reflect on them often with a fondness that is unexplainable to those who do not cherish books. The storyline is heartbreaking and yes, at times, depressing beyond belief. Theo’s life is an ongoing tragedy and the content is heavy to say the least, but there seems to be an underlying glimmer of hope that shines through ever so faintly. One thing that stood out to me the most throughout this book is how the memories are portrayed. In a lot of books you get these crystal clear images of how things used to be. With this book, Theo’s recollections are hazy from drug and alcohol abuse and fogged over with the passage of time. The memories are how we remember things- where you can’t really recall what you were thinking when you did something, just that you know at the time it felt right.The actual painting- the Goldfinch- becomes a metaphor throughout the book’s entirety. I can’t get over how intricate this story really was. You understood certain aspects at different moments and then there is a huge revelation that blows the whole storyline wide open that allows you to see the whole picture. You think you know right along while you are reading, but you truly have no idea until that moment just how careful Tartt was with weaving this story. I remember lying in bed reading at well past midnight, unable to put the book down, and upon reading the aforementioned revelation, sitting straight up in bed, throwing my hand over my mouth and silently saying “oh no, oh no, oh no!”. I sat there for several minutes, rereading it over and over again, silently admiring Tartt’s deft prose. I have seen a lot of negative reviews for this book, and I personally can’t understand them. I think this is truly one of the best books of our time and one that will stand the test of time. Perhaps if you have never had tragedy strike, or had a real bout of depression in your life, you won’t see the beauty in this book. Having watched my father take his last breath, and lived with depression for years while he battled cancer, I understood this book on a much deeper level.  “That life - whatever else it is - is short. That fate is cruel but maybe not random. That Nature (meaning Death) always wins but that doesn’t mean we have to bow and grovel to it. That maybe even if we’re not always so glad to be here, it’s our task to immerse ourselves anyway: wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open. And in the midst of our dying, as we rise from the organic and sink back ignominiously into the organic, it is a glory and a privilege to love what Death doesn’t touch.”I urge people to pick this book up. It is an instant classic in my opinion and will be talked about for years to come. The Goldfinch is truly one of a kind and will impact you in ways you never knew possible. I cannot even begin to do it the justice it deserves. A solid 5 star rating. I look forward to reading more of Tartt’s works."

Only pages into a few (Leonard, Hopkinson), a few I’ve read over half (Allison, Beagle) but almost all I intend to finish. But I’m considering throwing  The Goldfinch in the DNF pile.You know me–I don’t often give up on a book. Right time, right place and all that. But despite waiting forever for a library copy, I just don’t care. I picked up The Bread We Eat in Dreams just a day ago, trying to wipe the residue of a nasty meeting away. At 1%, I have a significant portion of writing of “The Consultant” outlined, writing that is playful, erudite, and cleverly self-aware. I mention this because Tartt's much-glorified writing was painful in comparison. Full of colons and semi-colons as if it was impossible to finish a thought. By all accounts, I ought to love The Goldfinch. Elaborate passages, vivid descriptions of New York–-and The Metropolitan Museum of Art, one of my favorite places in the world–-and loads of character depth.I still don’t care.It feels pretentious and preening, self-aware in that extravagantly dismissive way New Yorkers can have, that “look-at-me” image that dismisses you as soon as you look.And Theo, the lead character… I’m not warming up to him. Self-absorbed, noticeably lacking in empathy, he is the epitome of thirteen. Of course, Tartt could take him places, so I’ll keep reading. But I’m finding him hard to like, and with many Issues that seem self-generated, I really don��t care. Pity party of one, please–I’ll be leaving now.I might be able to forgive the writing, since I do love a well-turned image, and possibly I could come to be interested in Theo, but I’ve just reached the scene of the explosion and Theo’s reaction, which seems so consciously contrived and artificial that the writing shouts Detailed Over-Explanation for Meaningful Stuff that Will Be Important Later.I’m not saying I mind obvious, or contrived, but in this case, it starts to feel like three strikes: unlikeable narrator, pretentious writing, forced plotting.I’m going to thank the library for giving me an out.************************The Goldfinch, part deux:Tackling in larger chunks is working, spurred on partly by the library. Theo remains somewhat unlikeable, although I certainly have compassion. Still, I'm hearing strange echoes of Less Than Zero, which makes absolutely no sense.The first 200 pages are NYC and it is just about exactly like a Dutch painting. Feel like I'm there, but it is dark and gloomy. Extremely realistic, but the subject matter is barely interesting."

The Goldfinch
 (1654) - Carel Fabritius (1622 - 1654)”E é por isso que decidi escrever estas páginas como as escrevi. Porque só entrando na zona intermédia, a orla policroma entre a verdade e a não verdade, é tolerável estar aqui e a escrever isto.O que quer que nos ensine a falar connosco próprios é importante: o que quer que nos ensine a cantar para sairmos do desespero. Mas a pintura também me ensinou que podemos falar uns com os outros através do tempo. E sinto que tenho algo muito sério e muito urgente para te dizer, meu leitor inexistente, e sinto que devo dizê-lo com tanta urgência como se estivesse na mesma sala contigo. Que a vida – para além do mais que possa ser – é curta. Que o destino é cruel e talvez não aleatório. Que a Natureza (ou seja, a Morte) ganha sempre, mas isso não quer dizer que tenhamos de lhe baixar a cabeça e a bajular. Que, mesmo que talvez nem sempre nos sintamos contentes por estarmos aqui, a nossa tarefa é mergulhar, de qualquer maneira: passar a vau por ela, pela cloaca, com os olhos e o coração abertos. E no meio do nosso processo de morte, enquanto nos erguemos do orgânico, é uma glória e um privilégio amar aquilo que a Morte não toca. Porque, se o desastre e o esquecimento perseguiram esta pintura ao longo dos tempos, também o amor a perseguiu. Na medida em que é imortal (e é), eu tenho um papel pequeno, brilhante e imutável nessa imortalidade. Ela existe; e continua a existir. E eu acrescento o meu amor à história de pessoas que amaram coisas belas e olharam para elas e as tiraram das chamas e as procuraram quando elas andavam perdidas e tentaram preservá-las e salvá-las passando-as literalmente de mão em mão, cantando com todo o brilho da ruína do tempo para a geração seguinte de amantes, e a seguinte.” (Pág. 892 – 893) Este é o final do fenomenal romance ”O Pintassilgo” - vencedor do Pulitzer Prize for Fiction em 2014 - da escritora norte-americana Donna Tartt (n. 1963).

Ilustração de Wesley Merritt (in ""The Telegraph"")Inesperadamente, uma explosão ocorre, um atentado terrorista provoca um rebentamento tremendo e ensurdecedor que abalou várias salas do museu; a sua mãe é uma das vítimas mortais e Theo consegue sobreviver sem ferimentos físicos graves.Ilustração de Wesley Merritt (in ""The Telegraph"")No meio dos destroços Theo encontra um homem idoso gravemente ferido - Welton ""Welty"" Blackwell – em quem anteriormente reparara, porque estava acompanhado de uma rapariga bonita – Pippa - com uma pele linda, de um branco leitoso –, que aponta para ”(…) um quadro pequeno, o mais pequeno da exposição, e o mais simples: um pintassilgo amarelo contra um fundo simples, pálido, acorrentado a um poleiro pelo seu tornozelo fino como um galho.” (Pág. 37); e lhe diz: ”Leva-o embora dali.”, ”Leva-o contigo!”, dando-lhe um anel de ouro grosso com uma pedra encastoada e, por fim, articula: ”Hobart and Blackwell” – toca à campainha verde.” Este acontecimento dramático e trágico que ocorre de uma forma imprevisível e fortuita acaba por traumatizar, física e psicologicamente Theo, num momento em fica subjugado pelo medo e pela tristeza, baralhado e deprimido por incidentes e ocorrências que não compreende na sua totalidade: por um lado, tem que encontrar um significado para a sua vida, por outro lado, tem que interiorizar a perda física da sua adorável mãe e superar o abandono e a ausência por parte do seu pai; eventos que fomentam e estimulam o seu crescimento psicológico tornando-o (ou talvez não) num adolescente cada vez mais maduro e responsável. Quando conhece Boris Pavlikovsky – que lhe dá a alcunha de Potter – tudo, mas tudo se altera… A excelência da escrita de ”O Pintassilgo” deriva da sua simplicidade, incorporando admiravelmente as dificuldades sentimentais e emotivas de Theo Decker – nem sempre é um narrador confiável -, e dos inúmeros acontecimentos que vão ocorrendo na narrativa; o que não impede o leitor de poder reflectir sobre as ideias ou os pensamentos, por vezes, filosóficos que o jovem adolescente vai narrando, muitas vezes de uma forma labiríntica. Apesar da acção, ocasionalmente, poder parecer ser absurda, há todo um mundo que descobrimos - o do roubo e comercialização de objectos de artes falsificados, e o negócio de antiguidades; numa narrativa que decorre entre, Nova Iorque, Las Vegas e Amesterdão, na Holanda; existindo, igualmente, uma abordagem peculiar e desfocada entre o bem e o mal, entre a paixão e o amor; discorrendo, também, sobre o impacto que tem um determinado evento ou um determinado incidente ocasional, no crescimento e na progressão da existência e da vivência de um jovem adolescente. ”O Pintassilgo” não é um livro consensual - terá muito a ver com as próprias experiências individuais de cada um dos leitores -, mas combina de uma forma magnífica – por vezes, divertida -, personagens inolvidáveis com uma narrativa electrizante, induzida por um suspense que aumenta gradualmente, de um jovem que procura a sua identidade e a sua sobrevivência, numa narrativa que evolui de surpresa em surpresa, um portentoso thriller e uma original história de amor e de amores.”O Pintassilgo” na edição portuguesa tem quase 900 páginas. Haverá sempre a questão da razoabilidade ou da imprescindibilidade de um romance tão extenso – na minha opinião tem o número de páginas perfeito.Donna Tartt (n. 1963)"
129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen,Rating 3 out of 5,"I'm sure we all keep a mental is-the-game-worth-the-candle tally for activities we undertake. Like if the evening meal is to be consumed only by myself and one Significant Other, probably accompanied by a run-through of tomorrow's agenda and who needs the car and damn have we missed the news already, then spending more than forty minutes preparing said meal seems disproportionate to the amount of time spent eating it. Whereas if there are to be four round the table, with chatting, anecdotes, laughter and discussion, (and wine) a pleasurable process that can fill a whole evening, then spending four or five hours in the kitchen beforehand seems perfectly justified. Or when I create garments for my little grandson: I tend to make sure they will do 'for his growth' as my Dad would say, so that he will get at least a whole winter's wear out of what I have invested some several hours' (spread over weeks) work in making.How about this then? I read somewhere that Donna Tartt took twelve years to produce this Big Book. Maybe they meant that it is twelve years since her last one, so let's be generous and assume that she took some time off, and she took some time to go over the proofs, so let's say eight, nine years of the real hard graft type work, shall we? And then I read it in three days. No, no, I'm not trying to show off, look, I read 771 pages in just three days. I happened to be in a personal paradise: on holiday in the mountains where we would go out crossing contour lines in the early part of the day, and then come back to our holiday flat in the perfect state to read for several hours in the afternoon: physically languid from the morning's efforts, but mentally refreshed and alert. Thus able to sit for several hours at a time without feeling the need to get up and do something, and yet able to concentrate, as the morning had been spent in restful (almost) silence, slowing the mind to a walking pace, invigorated by majestic vistas. And it's not that I didn't enjoy it: I stayed with it, happily indeed, I liked Theo's company, I didn't even baulk at that section in Las Vegas that even people who adore this book find, well, long. Too long? No, it was fine, it needed a change of pace, a certain stasis, to intensify the contrast with the ripping stuff still to come. But (I know, there's nearly always a but with me these days) but but it's all so straightforward. A good story, yes, it cracks along. Pretty exciting, and all the more fun for having seen the famous painting at the Mauritshuis not more than three months since. Interesting characters, a satisfying ending, all the elements are there. I just don't quite know what I got out of it, apart from those three days of enjoyable relaxation: how can that be in any way proportionate to twelve years' - or nine, or whatever - writing? I was never required to make an effort. I was never challenged, except perhaps in my over-naive concept of Las Vegas: I'd never thought of people actually living there, going to school there, making friends there. I was never taught anything amazingly new, apart from a few colloquial names of drugs that I didn't know before - and have already forgotten, as it's not knowledge that will impinge on my life at all, ever. Oh, there is a bit of philosophy at the end there, but it's limited to insights of the calibre of ""There's no truth beyond illusion"", Art is the magic place where every idea and its opposite are equally true.
To try to make some meaning out of all this seems unbelievably quaint. Maybe I only see a pattern because I've been staring too long.
 Maybe I just didn't stare long enough."
130,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91622714-rosh,Rating 3 out of 5,"Ah well! So that’s that! I read it. Phew!What I loved:•	The story.•	The title that indicates not just the painting in the story but also works as a metaphor for the lead character Theo, who seems to be stuck in place no matter how much he tries to fly. It works brilliantly for the story.•	The emotions of the various lead characters who are so flawed and yet you can’t help connecting with them. Hobie was my favourite of the lot, but even Theo, with all his murky greys and Boris with his screwed-up Russian loyalties make a mark. (Making a mark doesn’t necessarily mean you will like them.)•	The writing quality, except for the length of the scenes, was excellent. The author’s use of analogies and character musings worked very well. It’s a character-driven novel from start to end.•	All the references to art. In my real life, I can’t make head or tail of paintings but I enjoyed reading the thoughts related to all things artistic in this book.What I did not love:•	The looooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggggggg scenes. The Bombayite in me kept complaining “
Kitna paka rahi hai!
” (Sorry, my international friends, but this is a sentiment that can’t be translated to English.) At least 200 pages could have been docked off the final tally if the author were focussed more on completing what she set out to do than establishing literary merit. •	Too much of philosophising, which adds to the dragged feel. •	32 hours on audio. Oh my dear God! I could have read 3 audiobooks in this time. If I had read this a decade ago, when I was younger and had more time & patience to deal with a 700 pager, I might have rated it 4 stars. But at this stage, I can rate it a 3.5 at best. No regrets reading it, but I’m relieved it’s done and dusted. No FOMO. And no reread on my agenda for this book. ***********************Join me on the Facebook group,

En ese momento recuerda haber soñado con su madre y nos cuenta su historia, se remonta a la edad de 13 años cuando sufrió un atentado terrorista en un museo, se encontraba en la sala donde está el cuadro ""El jilguero"" una obra de arte de 1654 del pintor holandés Fabritius, discípulo de Rembrandt y maestro de Vermeer. En medio del caso, sale del museo en ruinas con el cuadro y un anillo de un misterioso hombre que también se encontraba allí.Así arranca una novela que se las prometía felices, me ha encantado la narración, la prosa, como, al igual que Dickens nos cuenta la historia de un huérfano y nos lleva por los recovecos de los bajos fondos de la sociedad y de los sentimientos, las famlias de acogida, los tonteos con el alcohol, los viajes al abismo de las drogas, la mafia, el tráfico de obras de arte y la crítica social.Me ha gustado y desencantado a partes iguales, me ha gustado mucho lo que me contaba en algunos momentos aunque no aportara nada a la trama, de ahí la extensión del libro.Lo mejor la prosa, incluso en las partes menos interesantes de la historia avanzas sin darte cuenta, lo peor el final, no por la reflexión que hace que es magnífica sino por no atar cabos, casi 1200 páginas y el final abierto me ha parecido que a la autora se le acabaron las ideas para cerrar el libro...Es maravilloso pero no me atrevo a recomendarlo."

I did not feel connected to any of the characters (except maybe the dog) and I felt there were A LOT of extraneous details.I understand why people love this book, but it was not for me. I do want to read Tartt's other books because one book does not define an author."
133,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly,Rating 4 out of 5,"“An ugliness unfurled in the moonlight and soft shadow and suffused the whole world. If I were an amoeba, he thought, with an infinitesimal body, I could defeat ugliness. A man isn’t tiny or giant enough to defeat anything.”-― Yukio Mishima, The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea So, I don’t know if I ever mentioned this, I probably didn’t, but I grew up outside New York. And by ‘outside’ New York, I mean in the Mad Men-esque Connecticut suburbs where trenchcoated men with briefcases still wave goodbye to wives and children in sedans and catch the Met North trains to what we still refer to, all these years later, as “the City,” as if there could be no other.So on 9/11, in my hometown, there was perhaps a slightly more intensified version of the panic that swept the rest of the country evident. I was in homeroom when they made the announcement. A friend and I, both of us having for some reason left our cell phones at home that day, rushed to the guidance counselor to call and ask after our dads. My dad, of course, worked minutes from Grand Central, endless blocks and a side of the island away from the Towers, and my friend’s dad worked in a similarly out-of-the way location. Still, after I was obviously unable to reach my dad that morning, I called my mother. In the bizarre surreality of that morning, she spent about five minutes laughing at me and making fun of me for not knowing the geography of New York City while I cried and got melodramatic, until of course, which had been her aim all along, I got sheepish and even smiled a little in relief by the end. The rest of the day felt only like long minutes of waiting for the intercom to buzz and ask another one of my classmates to go to the office. My best friend was called out of chemistry class a few periods later- her father was supposed to fly out of Boston that day. I still remember her horror struck face as she turned around to look at me after they called her name, and my fierce denial, “He’s fine. He’s going to be fine,” over and over again. I held her and then collapsed in tears after she left- nobody said a word to me. One kind boy, who I had a crush on for at least a year afterwards, who had never spoken to me before, reached out and hugged me for a moment. My young teacher, the one everyone had a crush on, punched the wall and then let us just listen to the radio the rest of the period. I still remember even the bizarre outfit I had on, how I had dressed that morning with some idea of being some sort of boho cool girl- some flowery skirt and ridiculous men’s shirt that was too big for me, an absurd set of leather boots. I was curled up in a ball by last period as if somehow trying to hide the shame of the full ridiculousness of my outfit, which seemed to become more and more apparent and weirdly important as the day went on.In the end, as it turned out, we only lost one father from the entire school population that I know of. He was not the only person from our town who died, and there were several victims who lived in the next town over. And still, on that particular day, given the proportion who had gotten on the train that morning, how many people had survived felt like some sort of miracle. I don’t remember much about the days afterwards except a hush in the normally chaotic hallways, half-empty classes for days. I remember feeling numb, like I hadn’t a thought in my head. I don’t think I really grasped how big the whole thing was, not even then. Or maybe I didn’t want to. In any case, life returned to normal, at least for me and those I was close with, within a few weeks- kids are resilient, guys. And life goes on. Look, I’m not trying to compare my experience with this kid’s. In this book, he’s actually in the bombing- with physical injuries, amazingly traumatic experiences and the loss of the most important person in his life. He has family problems to start with that are off the charts, and very few people to lean on. These are all disadvantages that I have come close to having. Like I said, it turned out that anyone I had known was absolutely fine.But I remember how it was that day and the days afterwards- the time when you think that perhaps you are going to be this person- you think it as dramatically as only a dramatic teenager can, and then you live through the surreal hours doing surreal things…. Well, the glimmer of that that Tartt brought alive here, it brought out some memories that I haven’t thought about in years, and brought them back much more vividly than I had expected. That’s the first reason I’m writing this review and telling you the above story- I felt it was the most fitting tribute I could give to tell the truth that this story brought back to me.Secondly, I think perhaps what I’m telling you has a lot to do with the way that I interpret this story and what I focus on. Because, you see, I think that this is a story about ugliness. I think that whatever else this is about, in the end it is a story about ugliness, about the ultimate ugliness that can be committed and the choices that we can make as we try to heal ourselves, and in the end, the only one that really works.* * *  Spoiler warning from here on in. Deal with it or stop reading.The Goldfinch begins with the agonizingly precise memories of a survivor of a bombing in New York City. He recounts each moment of the day through the prism of his own guilt as a child who somehow survived the bombing, while his mother, whom he was with that day, did not. We follow him through his post-traumatic stress of the months and years ahead as he recounts what his life becomes after the day and the various methods that he finds to deal with the unsatisfying and, really, horrifying reality at hand. We witness, as near as I can tell, nearly twenty years of his life after the events. The Dickensian comparisons are apt, though I would say that that is only true in part of the first section of the book, and I think that is there merely to set up a frame that is absolutely meant to disappoint us. I think we are meant to be deceived and then undeceived about the purpose of this book using feints of literary devices and I think the Dickensian one is just the most prominent. It does dwell quite a bit, David-Copperfield-esque, on “the story of my life,” but remains compelling throughout.…. All right, then. Summation duties taken care of.Let’s get down to what this is really about, shall we?This is not a story about an Dickensian orphan- particularly not an orphan who makes good and pulls themselves up by their bootstraps or charming-little-poppetness. Not a Jane Eyre, Oliver Twist or even adorable Little Princess waiting to be rescued with Orientalist fantasies in sight.As I say above, this is a story about ugliness and how we heal from such a suffocating, searing amount of ugliness being thrown in our face that it seems difficult to ever completely scroll through the footage, as if it will never be done. I mentioned above that this is a story about a (presumably terrorist) bombing in New York City. However, what I failed to mention above is that the target was altered slightly this time. In this version, the chosen site was not the World Trade Center, which in this universe is already gone. This time, because destroying an economic center was not enough, the target was, perhaps as literally as it could be, the content of Western civilization. That is, the art, culture, learning, the storage and display space of the beauties of millennia: the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This time it is Rembrandt and Manet and Vermeer, the light colors of the Italian Renaissance, Chinese armor and ancient sculpture that go up in flames along with countless human lives. The narrator’s mother, just before the bomb goes off, had gone back for just one more look at the paintings that inspire her to get through her presumably soul-sucking job that only hints at the real arts she loves- in advertising. The narrator has just been shown his mother’s favorite painting, the Goldfinch, which she tells him about a length and in detail, in a lecture that he can barely listen to, about the beauty that inspires her. He only has eyes for the cute girl down at the end of the gallery receiving a similar lecture from a man he takes to be her grandfather.The rest of the book is him learning what his mother was on about, slowly and painfully. And honestly? It only happens because everything else he tries first doesn’t work.Here are some notes and thoughts on what I found as he tries to work through the mess that's left behind:-Theme of the abandoned child: A child who has been constantly abandoned, fending for himself and making his own way again and again. How does a child cope and deal with things?: Usually by escapism of some sort. In this case first by the fantasy of recreating something out of your own life, then by drugs and running away. Reality is too hard to look at- you make excuses for it and get ugly with it. A child usually finds some sort of step-parent, some sort of magical person who will make it all right. He finds it and loses it constantly- no one is ever that “all being” person- Hobie comes the closest, but it doesn’t work out as it should- life and ugliness intervene.- After his mother dies, he is taken in by a rich family who slowly start to care for him and see him as a healing influence on their awkward only child- he starts to bloom in small ways and hope. He has a land of magical antiques that he learns to fix in a fairy land that is essentially time out of mind, with a sleeping princess who will surely one day awake and become his own. Everything is about to turn out quite all right for the Little Princess, for Oliver Twist, for Jane Eyre… when reality intervenes. When he learns how thin that fairy tale is and how much people will NOT step over the line to help him- even if they know that it would be best for him. It is really not their business and isn’t it better this way- even if, for a minute, they were going to become something more.-Clarity of the last “normal” you feel that you understood vs. the surreality of all that follows: At first he clings to the last normal, tries very hard not to break its china walls and to save something of what he had. He even finds a secret healing spring- you can see where it is all going. When illusion is taken from him, his adventures are almost too over the top to be true- a person living almost permanently in an altered state of consciousness. As I say, first the arrival of the bizarre father and his bizarrer girlfriend, living in a mirage of a town- created by dreamers on a pile of sand that can only exist by artificial creation with no real roots, no water (the source of all life in fairy tales), then living on alcohol and drugs with little food in the house- not even, as we find out later, much aware of what he is doing or saying in those other worlds- not aware of how much reality he is letting spill over even while he is pressing hard and fully on the escapist button. Then just trying to fly under the radar and not let people in your “real” home guess just how much of that surreality that you brought back with you- how much it has altered you.- Is Boris the evil stepmother of this novel? Forcing you out of the nest to face truths and life, however cruelly? One of my favorite things I ever read about the function of evil stepmothers- forcing you to grow up and abandon your childhood status. I don’t know if he’s really that or if he’s some sort of perverse genie, granting wishes by the score, even the awful ones- granting Theo the oblivion of drugs and alcohol and irresponsible behavior, but nonetheless the kind that comes with love and good intentions. Perhaps I’m romanticizing it and Boris is just the Guide- the one who has been in the trauma before and is making sure that Theo doesn’t stray from the path too far along the way- that is the path that he, a similarly childish and inexperienced person, knows? (The childlike nature of so much of the suffering here really is the most heartbreaking part.) A Guide in the Rumpelstiltskin making-deals sort of way, but nonetheless a generally well meaning one? His reveal of the falseness of the talisman all along suggests at the very least an ambiguous fairy tale role. I hate to just settle on the Trickster, as this seems too obvious. Does anyone have an idea?-After Theo comes back to New York, after he finagles and moves his way into some semblance of adulthood, he himself is actually the one that dirties up his fairy tale place of refuge before. It is still the place that it ever was, the same kindly grandfather with his antiquated ways and kind eyes still looks after it. It is he who sees the flaws and tries to save it- he knows it is no longer a fairy tale. The adult involved does not, which I thought was an interesting distinction. The adult leaves the preservation of the place to Theo, leaves it to him in fact from the time that he was far too young to have the possibility- even then Theo is really abandoned to the world and forced to playact a grown up before his time-  et in Arcadia ego, man.-His relationship with the other bomb survivor, the girl, was also pretty well drawn. And once again I thought Tartt resisted the temptation to hand us a Victorian redemption tale, some sort of exclusive club of two where only they can understand. I thought she tackled the much more complicated question of whether they really want to spend time in that club at all, whether that’s really the way that it would work out. This was pretty cleverly juxtaposed against Theo’s renewed relationship with that rich family that had originally taken him in- they are survivors too, of a different sort of tragedy. And he involves himself with their aftermath, just dives deeply right into the middle of it and refuses to see that that is what he is doing. The disastrous knot of obligations and sadness and memories and anger that result are predictable, and a justification of Fiona’s near non-presence in Theo’s world or even New York City in general. Survivors, in this view, should avoid each other, not band their pain together. It’s a unique take on things in a world of support groups and 1-800 numbers.And finally, on the biggest theme I found:In the end, after all this, I think the greatest lesson that the narrator learns is the difference between two kinds of healing: comfort and beauty. I think that this is a choice that most of us make each day, after any tough day: Should I go home and order a warm pizza and collapse on the couch? Or should I stand on my tired feet and force myself to make the kind of lovely meal that I could make with just a little bit of thought that I know I will feel ten times better about having made later? Should turn my roiling brain to the problems of Proust or turn off my brain with whatever nonsensical reality tv show I can find?This is starker than it needs to be- I think there are probably many of us who choose to heal ourselves with some combination of the above most of the time, and anyone who says that they choose the high road every time is either a liar or actually inhuman. I think that a lot of the time it probably goes: perhaps the pizza but also a great movie, or perhaps the well-made dinner but then also a comfort tv show. And who am I to define what is “comfort” and what is “beauty” for most? Sometimes those things can become mightly confused, especially at the end of a rough day. But in the end, at least for me, I know that what I classify as “beauty” is more powerful, for me, than anything else. I know that when I have the confidence and clear-sightedness to know that that is what I actually want that I will go to bed feeling like I’ve beaten something. Beauty, in the form of the Goldfinch, is a kind of talisman for Theo. It’s like the magic object that gets the hero through the quest- something that he draws his power from- like Samson’s hair or the One Ring. It’s a secret that he has literally kept locked away, knowing that its power is still there and potent, until he is ready to make use of it. His magical token also serves as his noble Task, given to him in the moments where it seemed like there was nothing worth living for. He saves it due to an erratically lovely, dying man that he sees in the museum who gives him a Mission. He’s the man who brought his last glimpse of a “normal” teenage development there through his presumed granddaughter. He gives him his Task and a concrete, if cryptic, next step to follow. The ring and the painting- one talisman and another. He gives him a key to another world that will heal him. “Ring the green bell,” he tells him, which, as nearly as it can do, takes him to centuries before this one- surrounded by objects that have stood the test of time and need only a little healing with a sort of dying alchemy before they go back out in the world again. As often as he can, he seeks this quiet refuge and goes about learning to heal in the way that this master knows how to. Of course we find, in the end, that you’ve always had the power to go back to Kansas- you didn’t need a talisman, it was empty. The world screwed you out of your fairy tale and your magic again- but it didn’t matter, because you drew power from it, from the beauty and meaning of it to you. It was all about being forced to move on from thinking that you had magic, to dealing with reality. Even though it turns out that the talisman itself is important to Theo and that its physical presence matters, it causes him to think about why more than he ever has. It causes him to acknowledge his possession of it in a way that he hadn’t before- he’d been constantly thinking of it as a problem rather than the healing ointment it was. In the end, it was the solution he’d actually been looking for all along. The novel had flaws, certainly. It dragged a bit in the middle, and while I appreciated the detail and realistic nature of telling us chapters about Theo’s struggle with drugs as an adult, as well as the meaning of the time he spent revisiting his almost-family, I think that the point could have been made more elegantly and simply, and probably didn’t need the almost two hundred pages that it took. (Though of course given the length of this review and my inability to focus it any more clearly than I have, who am I to talk?) I do also think that some of the writing verged on the over-the-top melodramatic even for my taste, some of the insights were a bit precious, standing out like bad eggs in the midst of otherwise lovely prose. I gently regretted the demise of the novel’s first premise, of redemption amongst old vanities and writing desks, which would have made the same point in the end- if without all the mess and dirt and realistic pain that Tartt brought to it. I understand why she didn’t, I really do, but I would have read that book as well. Perhaps that is a tribute to the recognizable nature of what she put Theo through that I just wanted it to stop so early on.I think, in the end, though, I appreciated the ending. I think that we get the sense that Theo has figured out what matters to him and how he is going to get on with his life. Like Molly Bloom, he has found a way to say  “yes I will yes,”  without compromising the gravity of his experience or his memories. I think that he ultimately finds his way around nihilism, and I think it is because he learns to choose beauty over comfort. I think that it is because he finally… well… I don’t know how to say this somewhat embarrassingly simple moral without just saying it: The young man finally listened to his mother."
134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was VERY hesitant to read this book. I am worried that my giving it three stars will say to many that it is not worth reading, and that is not the message I want to leave. I am very glad I read this book. I will explain why the reasons I didn't want to read this book were wrong, at least for me! Lastly I will explain the simple reason why I gave it three stars and not more. Remember, three stars means I liked the book and it is worth reading. Negative reviews state that the book is too long and that it needs better editing. I disagree. In this book it is the details that make the book. The characters are three dimensional. Not one of them is a cardboard figure. It takes detailed descriptions to show the nuances of a character; both the positive and negative aspects must be shown. In this book we discover the characters through their actions, through descriptions, through humor, through dialogs and through philosophical meanderings. Not just one or two, but many of the characters become real life people with good and bad attributes. All these words and pages also described the settings where the story unfolds - NYC, Amsterdam and Las Vegas. The places are palpable - through the very details that some reviewers want cut away. Not me! Art and literature and drugs and furniture restoration are all detailed. I liked the details. It is the small details about an artist or an author that make the art and the literature mean something. The same is true of a person that is addicted to drugs. To understand you need the details. The prevalence of drug usage is what many say makes the book just not nice to read. Keep in mind that it is important to look at how the author views drugs. Is it condoned? Such a message is not given in this book. You come to understand how people are drawn into its clutches, and how difficult it is to escape. At the same time people are not written off, and this is important to me.Thirdly, I thought, ""What in the world is this book going to teach me?"" Well, the end has a philosophical tone that draws all the threads together and leaves messages that are worth considering. The conclusions drawn are to my liking! Art - what is its purpose, and why is it so important? Tartt stresses art's personal significance to an individual. When you look at a painting, or a ceramic vase or a piece of beautiful furniture, what does it do to you? YOU, I mean you. Nothing else is important at all. I couldn't agree more. Another theme is the nature of people - that every single one of us has good and bad qualities. Again I agree. She takes this theme and draws on it a bit more. How does one get the most out of one's potential? By following our personal attributes or by following the guidelines prescribed by society? And what if we have qualities that draw us toward evil..... She shows us that good actions do not always result in good and bad actions in bad. It adds a whole other perspective to how we judge ourselves. There is so much one can discuss concerning these themes; I found them interesting. Finally, we have all lived through 9/11. Historically speaking, in generations to come, it will be interesting to look back at our generation and see how we changed after the event. Another central theme of the book is post-traumatic stress disorder. What I am saying is that the book covers interesting themes.  I have to mention the humor. Damn, there are funny lines! If I have to pick the character I love the most I guess it would be Boris. His is the alcoholic and a drug addict and really quite a criminal, but listen, he has good qualities too. And his English is SO bad. (He made me smile, making me think how bad my French can sometimes be!) That is just part of what makes him funny. He is sweet too. His mom was Polish and his father Russian. What a character!!!! Then there is Mrs. Barbour and Pippa and Hobie .Oh gosh, I love Hobie too. A good bunch of characters - if you are looking for a book with character portrayal. There is mystery too, related to art theft. David Pittu does an absolutely fabulous narration of the audiobook. I loved his voices for Boris, for Pippa, for Mrs. Barbour. Not many male narrators can do women this well. This has definitely been an enjoyable read, but I feel that with time it may sink into the crowd of all the many, many good books out there. That is why three stars. I feel a bit miserly, but I think this rating will stand the test of time.I keep thinking of more things I should mention. After reading the book you will need to go on internet and read about the painting “The Goldfinch” by Carel Fabritius, a student of Rembrandt’s. This was his last paining. He was killed at the age of 32 in 1654. Here you can see the painting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritshuis, to be found at the Mauritshuis Museum in The Haag, Netherlands. Here is another thing to think about – why is the book’s title The Goldfinch?! Look at the painting carefully."

Did I call it, or did I call it? ;) I submitted a hold request for the The Goldfinch at the library in early November, then shut my eyes and closed my ears to other readers' reviews for five months, until the doorstop landed on my doorstep. The librarian saw fit to remind me it was a two-week checkout only; the waiting list behind me was longer than the one I'd waited through. O ye of little faith. Four mornings later, I turned the final page. When I am compelled to devour a nearly-eight hundred page novel in my every spare moment, there's really no option but to pin five stars to my book report. Whatever flaws I might identify or frustrations I might feel are trivial in comparison to a reader's pure joy in losing herself in a narrative. When all the elements come together: an original, intriguing plot, thoughtful, profound themes, complex, troubling, hilarious, characters, and language that makes me tremble for its beauty, clarity, and confidence, I gratefully set all analysis aside and give myself up to the sheer magic of a great book. It's taken me a while to come to this review, because I've read several since finishing the book and I really have nothing original to add. Apparently, a struggle faced by many of the professional reviewers, who all rushed to be the first, or the next, to declare The Goldfinch Dickensian in style and scope. To be sure, the rollicking cast of characters is one of the very best things about this novel.But, there are so many very best things about this novel and you're wasting time reading my review, when you should be reading The Goldfinch. After all, you don't want my librarian hunting you down. Should it actually take you longer than two weeks to read it. Which I doubt very much. "

Mas irei abrir uma excepção para um livro que me parece pouco conhecido entre o publico português.O Pintassilgo (titulo em português) é a trajetória de vida de Theo Decker, desde que uma tragédia o deixou órfão de mãe aos 12 anos de idade. Theo sente-se sozinho e abandonado e com uma sensação de insegurança e de fim-de-mundo que o enchem de terror. Ele vai entretanto viver com o pai onde mais infortúnios acontecem. Conhece pessoas, lugares e em todos se sente desenraizado, nenhum é o lugar certo para ele, pois o seu lugar certo seria ao pé da mãe. Ao mesmo tempo, uma preciosa obra de arte desaparece.Não posso dizer muito mais a não ser que não entrem neste livro a pensar em mistérios e coisas por desvendar. É um romance de pessoas, de circunstancias diversas e de como num segundo tudo o que era tomado por certo se desvanece e tem que se viver com as novas premissas. Fazendo escolhas e tomando decisões - certas e erradas. É um livro com personagens densas, profundas, com falhas, com virtudes e com algumas redenções.Adorei o modo como o livro me agarrou e não largou ao longo das 864 paginas - isso não é feito pequeno. A escrita é fluida, simples mas poética ao mesmo tempo. E faz-nos sentir tudo o que os personagens estão a sentir, o que só mostra a mestria de Donna Tartt. Quero ler muito mais desta excelente autora."

138,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book has been sitting around my stacks since August 24, 2013, the day my won giveaway copy came. A great deal of my acquired literature does the same, the rate at which I come by them far exceeding the speed in which I get through them, and it's usually a comfortable backburner reassurance of ""I'm here, it's there, we'll meet each other soon."" However, mounting hype makes me wary of a piece of work like nothing else, and so I put it off and put it off and put it off until reactionary backlash to the book's success pissed me off so much I finally picked it up out of curiosity and no small amount of spite. As was the case with my reading of The Hunger Games, if I'm going to pass judgment on something, the least I should do is read it.A perfect subtitle for The Goldfinch would be 'Harry Potter for Grownups'. While the word 'Dickensian' keeps getting thrown around, I grew sick of Dickens back in high school, so the term holds very little weight in my mind. Harry Potter, however, is an obvious transplant: poor little boy traumatized by the death of a parent and eventually rescued by a combination of circumstance and upper class white people. The drugs and art and fetish for Russia are new, but that's where the US comes in with its penchant for substituting objects for communal worth and subsequent coked out disillusionment, as well as its obsession with the ""Old World"" as the source of all its ham-handed philosophical depth. As suicidal as Theo gets, both handsome and intelligent by the standards he's been born into, he still can't bear to be near those who fit the stereotype of homeless people. Imagine that.It's a mark of my own sensibilities that, for all that, I still enjoyed it, much as I loved The Secret History when I was younger. All that decrying of the US concerns traits that I, as a US citizen, was born and bred to enjoy, and I can no more pretend that I didn't love The Sorcerer's Stone back then than I can acquire a new blood type. However, what enamored me in Tartt's first tome was something far more vicious and seething, an Old Testament feel of ancient violence wedded to the cold practicality of the modern day void.
“But how,” said Charles, who was close to tears, “how can you possibly justify cold-blooded murder?’Henry lit a cigarette. “I prefer to think of it,” he had said, “as redistribution of matter.”
My high school self, made to believe that college and its esoteric thrills were my only source of redemption, swooned. My current self would not be as impressed, but would be far more satisfied by that cutting wit afforded by those who think themselves psychopaths than what The Goldfinch gave me, a sensationalized landscape populated with colonialism ideologies and people far more human and far less interesting. If you're going to make me watch people with a phenomenal standard of living dealing with the tragedies of death as if they're the first ones to do it, at least make them entertaining.The fact that this book won the awards it did says more about the world that nurtured it than I ever could. It is a cousin to The Namesake, glutted on references to brands and objects with certain pieces of Russian Literature and Other European Cultural Output as the holy grail of the main character's personal meaning. Both of them even reference Proust near the end, which makes me wonder how many degrees of separation there are between Tartt and Lahiri. For all that, as remarked previously, I liked it, Hobie and Boris and certain meanderings on the wonders of creative work and subsequent legacy having succeeded in lodging close to my heart. One last note: While Infinite Jest would tear this book apart in terms of its every critical theme and monumental message, IJ was written by a man. Rewording a statement I saw somewhere online, equality between the genders will be achieved when a woman can be rewarded for shoddy work as obscenely as a man can. In light of that, I'm glad this won instead of The Son or The Woman Who Lost Her Soul. Scream that I'm infecting the pristine puddle of the Halls of Literature with affirmative action and other leftist insipidities all you like, I know what the ratios of male to female Pulitzer Prize winners are, and so should you.I lied about the one last note part. If a US citizen out there is complaining about the dearth of workshop fiction, there's a way to give young people a chance to get published without worries of adhering to commercial stability. It's called voting, aka using the system to better the machine. As popular as it is to forgo paying attention to and participating in politics in favor of mulling over works with true 'meaning', all it means is that you like your Entertainment with a hint of know-better-than-thou flavor while ignoring the realities of living in this world of ours if you're not the 1%. Aka, you want to live in the world of The Goldfinch, and all that bemoaning of it winning the Pulitzer is pomp and circumstance. If you actually care about literature beyond your own benefit, you'll want to make it grow.P.S. If I didn't make it clear at the beginning, I won this in one of Goodreads' giveaways."

Μου άρεσε δεν το αγάπησα όμως και ούτε νομίζω ότι θα το θυμάμαι ποτέ ως ένα από τα σπουδαιότερα αναγνώσματα που έχω κάνει χωρίς αυτό βέβαια να μειώνει την αξία του βιβλίου. Δε χωράει καμία αμφιβολία ότι η καρδερίνα είναι ένα καλογραμμένο βιβλίο, εξαιρετικά καλογραμμένο θα έλεγε κανείς και δε χρήζει αμφισβήτησης ότι η συγγραφέας χειρίζεται εξαιρετικά το λόγο, Ευγλωττία και απίστευτες γνώσεις σε υπερβολικό ίσως βαθμό είναι στοιχεία διάχυτα καθ’ όλη τη διάρκεια του βιβλίου. Δε θα πρέπει επίσης να παραλείψουμε το γεγονός ότι πέρα του μεγάλου όγκου του περί τις 992 σελίδες η καρδερίνα είναι ένα βιβλίο το οποίο αποκλείεται να μη σου προκαλέσει καμία αίσθηση δεδομένου ότι είναι τέτοιο το περιεχόμενο του που αποκλείεται να σε αφήσει αδιάφορο είτε με την θετική έννοια ή με την αρνητική δεδομένου ότι πριν το ξεκινήσω διάβασα χιλιάδες κριτικές άλλες αποθεωτικές άλλα που του απέδιδαν τον όρο βαρετό, για άλλους ήταν ένα ντικενσιανό παραμύθι δεδομένης της ταυτότητας του ήρωα μας, άλλοι κατατάσσουν ήδη την ταρτ στο πάνθεον των κλασσικών συγγραφέων της νέας γενιάς ενώ άλλοι θεωρούν υπερβολική τη βράβευση της με πούλιτζερ. Η Καρδερίνα λοιπόν μας αφηγείται τη μικρή Οδύσσεια του 13χρονου Θίοντορ και το ταξίδη του προς την ενηλικίωση από τη στιγμή που χάνει ξαφνικά τη μητέρα του. Σε πρωτοπρόσωπη αφήγηση γινόμαστε μάρτυρες της ζωής του Θίο, μιας ζωής που έχει λίγο πολύ όλα από ναρκωτικά και λαθρεμπόριο, πρόσωπα που έρχονται και φεύγουν και παίζουν καταλυτικό ρόλο στη ζωή του. Κάθε ιστορία και κάθε μέρος της ζωής του και ένας συμβολισμός. Φιλίες, πάθη, μυστικά, ατμοσφαιρικές περιγραφές των πόλεων που αποτέλεσαν σταθμό του Θιοντορ εναλλάσσονται επιδέξια από την Ταρτ. Μάλιστα κάποιες περιγραφές ήταν τόσο ζωντανές και παραστατικές πχ το κομμάτι των ναρκωτικών που θα ορκιζόταν κανείς ότι η συγγραφέας της είχε βιώσει η ίδια και τις κατέγραψε στο έργο της. Όλα καλά μέχρι εδώ. Πράγματι όλα καλά οπότε και φτάνουμε στο μεγάλο αλλά. Το δικό μου μεγάλο αλλά. Η καλύτερη συμβουλή που πήρα σχετικά με την ανάγνωση της καρδερίνας ήταν από τη φίλη Λίνα και την ευχαριστώ γι αυτό ότι θα έπρεπε να σκέφτομαι ότι ακούω την ιστορία του Θίοντορ, σαν να μαστε στον ίδιο χώρο και μου εξομολογείται πλευρές της ζωής του παρά να νιώθω ότι το διαβάζω. Είχε απόλυτο δίκιο διότι η συγκεκριμένη τακτική μου εξασφάλισε αν μη τι άλλω μια πιο θετική αντιμετώπιση στην ιστορία και σίγουρα δεν ένιωσα την ανάγκη να κάνω τη ζαβολιά και να παραλείψω μερικές σελίδες από την ανάγνωση εν τούτοις όμως θεωρώ ότι σε αρκετά σημεία ο αφηγητής μας υπήρξε αρκετά φλύαρος σε σημείο εμμονικό κατά την ταπεινή μου άποψη. Αυτές οι αναλυτικές περιγραφές σε σημεία με κούρασαν αν και υπήρχαν και περιγραφές όμορφα δοσμένες αν και νομίζω ότι στην πραγματικότητα το μεγαλύτερο πρόβλημα μου ήταν ότι ακριβώς λόγω αυτής της στεγνής καταγραφής των γεγονότων θα έλεγα ότι δεν κατάφερα να συνδεθώ ιδιαίτερα με τους πρωταγωνιστές και μάλλον δεν συμπάθησα ιδιαίτερα τον Θίο δηλαδή εντάξει αγόρι μου καταλαβαίνω τα ζόρια σου αλλά θα μπορούσες να σουν πιο σύντομος στην εξιστόρηση του δράματος. Μου έλειψε το συναίσθημα ενώ το φινάλε μάλλον με άφησε με κάποια ερωτηματικά και δεν ένιωσα ακριβώς ότι ο Θίοντορ ως άλλος Οδυσσέας βρήκε την Ιθάκη του. Θα μου πείτε δεν ξέρω και αν ήταν το ζητούμενο της συγγραφέως αυτό αλλά σίγουρα θα προτιμούσα ξεκάθαρες απαντήσεις αντί φιλοσοφικών αναζητήσεων. Η καρδερίνα είναι ένα βιβλίο που σίγουρα αξίζει να διαβαστεί αλλά δεν ξέρω αν θα δικαιολογήσει για όλους την φήμη που το συνοδεύει. Ένα πραγματικά πολύ φιλόδοξο εγχείρημα που στήθηκε με τις καλύτερες προθέ��εις και από κει και πέρα είναι στο χέρι του κάθε αναγνώστη αν θα γίνει ένα με τις περιπέτειες του κατά πολλούς σύγχρονου Όλιβερ Τουιστ.

143,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1198255-madeleine,Rating 5 out of 5,"(This review was originally written for and posted at the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography's site. My own funds supplied this book.)The story that is the backbone of Donna Tartt's third novel, The Goldfinch, is one I keep seeing compared rather favorably, if not with a bit of reductive simplicity, to Dickens: An adolescent Theo Decker loses his mother in a museum explosion, leaving him first emotionally orphaned and later legally unmoored when his ne'er-do-well father meets a graciously early end (which is the only death in this book that brought me physical relief), eventually driving him to seek refuge with the avuncular Hobie, an antiques dealer to whom Theo was fatefully led in the aftermath of his mother's death. Theo carries around the untreated damage of his mother's death for as long as The Goldfinch follows him---into the early years of his adulthood---and presumably well beyond that to the point where he refers to his PTSD and its array of triggers with a familiarity usually reserved for an appendage. This gaping, fiercely protected wound draws him into some less than savory proclivities, like a nasty drug habit and selling Hobie's lovingly refurbished antiques as extant relics from earlier times, unbeknownst to the guardian who's more of a father figure than he's ever known in the only way he knows how to rescue the older man from financial ruin, but also renders Theo so bravely honest and sympathetically magnetic that it's easy to forgive his lesser qualities, especially since many of his shortcomings are born of a marriage between good intentions and limited options.In fact, among the myriad lessons this book explores regarding the dualities of human nature and life itself, the fact that goodness doesn't always come from goodness and that bad doesn't always beget bad is one of its most fervently emphasized--and it should come as no surprise that a novel so devoted to art should be so keen on the notion that the world is painted in much more than just blacks and whites. The Goldfinch borrows its title from the Carel Fabritius painting of the same name (the artist, it should be noted, also died in an explosion), a favorite painting of his mother's that Theo ""rescues"" from the museum during his dazed, frantic efforts to escape, a theft that was really executed as a testament to the hope that his mother would soon return home to both her son and the painting he liberated for her delight alone. It is the painting that propels Theo toward a life of covert misdeeds but it is also a tangible connection to the mother whose death threw the trajectory of his future regrettably off course. Theo himself is proof that something good can come from less than well-intentioned origins, as his own father lacks the integrity and heart Theo inherited from his mother. Far from harboring delusions about himself, Theo is his own worst critic, which only renders him all the more likable.Theo is the bruised, beating heart of this novel and the supporting cast does lend vibrant splashes of color and gorgeous harmonies throughout the composition, but the cities Theo finds himself ping-ponging across are just as alive as any corporeal character. The New York City Theo considers his lifelong home and the one he returns to after years of Las Vegas life reflect the city's tireless mutability as well as Theo's own internal metamorphosis. If NYC acts almost as its own foil, then the thin, flashy veneer and always encroaching desert of Vegas offers a glimpse into downright alien territory, a life of premature adulthood's self-reliance and prolonged childhood's tendency toward bad life choices under the uninterested watch of his self-absorbed father that contrasts darkly but critically against with the two-against-the-world safety and warmth his mother offered. The unceremonious and abrupt shift to Amsterdam robs the city of some of its old-world, foreign charm in Theo's alternately confused, feverish and despairing states during his relatively short but transformative stay, but Tartt still subtly weaves its essence into Theo's distracted narration. The full effect allows the unique spirits of the three cities to spring off each page with a palpable dimensionality that is wholly immersive. It is impossible to not see each dark street, feel each slap of icy wind and tiny drop of sweat, conjure each richly but unobtrusively detailed scene down to the draping of a tablecloth.The painstaking research that went into this book--foreign languages, art, literature, antiques restoration, far-flung locales, capturing low-brow banter and high-class empty chatter with equally convincing success--is as impressive as Tartt's enviable command of storytelling and word-slinging. Each detail is as necessary as it is beautifully finessed, the mark of a gifted writer who knows exactly what to highlight for maximum impact rather than an amateur's scattershot load of tacked-on trivialities to hold up a story that carries no emotional weight.A work that champions the restorative power of art, how one thing can be so beautiful in so many ways that it indiscriminately sings out to scores across the barriers of time and geography and culture to unite an audience that can't begin to know the exhaustive scope of its reach, ought to be an appropriately transformative work itself. Celebrating a masterful talent that echoes across otherwise impregnable distances because it is so rarely seen again rings trite if the tribute isn't equal to the task. The Goldfinch hits all the high notes, captures a complicated spirit in the warmest and richest of tones, and deploys an impressive literary arsenal all to such resounding success that it is, without a scrap of doubt, my only logical choice for Best Book of 2013. What else do you call a book that spans nearly 800 pages and still feels too short? That it takes a commanding self-control to write about without using five exclamation points after every caps-locked sentence? That brings with its last page the heartache of saying goodbye to an old friend?"
144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.75 stars for the book, 5 stars for the narrator Well, I do have to mention first of all the elephant in the room -- and elephant is a good word because this book is HUGE. Much too long for it to remain pleasurable. At first I was loving every single word, all the detailed descriptions of places, art, people, you name it. I really loved everything about it, thought it fun and intelligent. But by the last part, in Amsterdam, after 30 hours of my time had elapsed, I grew impatient with the descriptions and waiting for everything to be wrapped up. It was a solid 5 stars up to this point.For some reason, books about art seem to engage me. One solitary art history class in college surely could not be the reason. I guess I'm just very visual -- I like to imagine the artwork as described and the viewers' reactions to it. The Goldfinch was a small painting that Theo and his mom were enjoying in a museum, about 5 minutes before the place blew up around them. In the rubble, Theo and a dying man found the piece and the man encouraged Theo to take it for safekeeping. It gives him comfort and solace throughout his life, as life itself is in upheaval from then on. In adulthood Theo works in an antique store with a wonderful man, Hobie. A good friend Theo once had, Boris, makes a reappearance, and, well, it's hard to figure if Boris really was/is a good friend at all. Certainly not a good influence on someone as lost, lonely, and vulnerable as Theo; but the two of them make for an interesting combo which I won't soon forget. I adored Theo growing up, bad decisions and all. As an adult, I still felt sorry for him but his decisions were starting to affect other people.I look forward to the movie coming out this year! Here's a trailer:https://youtu.be/IcG06hZooHMDavid Pittu is now one of my top three favorite narrators. No problem handling women, girls, heavy smokers, young and old men, guys with NY accents, Ukrainian accents, proper British accents, Russian and French languages -- this had to have been a challenging book for one person alone to narrate, but he nailed it. Perfect choice! And after 32+ hours, he didn't sound the slightest bit hoarse!"

146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92664725-rochelle,Rating 4 out of 5,"Trigger warnings: [Parental neglect, PTSD, physical abuse, gun violence, depression, attempted suicide, alcoholism, heavy drug abuse]✿✿✿✿✿✿✿According to the New York Times, it took Tartt over ten years to finish writing The Goldfinch. More often than not, extensive effort like this fails to shine through properly in stories (I am not so innocently looking at you, V.E. Schwab), but in everything that this book is, I could tell that the author poured her heart and soul into writing it. That in itself is admirable. It allows the reader to feel reassured, in a way — every scene, every character, every emotion is so planned out and motivated that I knew from the start that it couldn't possibly be a waste of my time to read all 800+ pages.The Goldfinch is full of complex emotions. It follows 13 year old Theodore Decker from the moment he walks into an art museum with his mother. A deadly explosion kills almost everybody in the building (including Theo's mother), but Theo miraculously survives. He takes one of Carel Fabritius's paintings with him; a small piece portraying a goldfinch chained by the leg. This painting ultimately pulls Theo into the criminal universe, while it simultaneously acts as a souvenir of sorts, as it is so connected to his mother.
""It's crazy,"" she'd said, ""but I'd be perfectly happy if I could sit looking at the same half dozen paintings for the rest of my life. I can't think of a better way to go insane.""
The focus on art throughout this book, be it antique furniture or paintings, is brilliant. While there is a lot of storyline to latch on to (this is, after all, a bildungsroman), there are also more than a few good points written in about the importance and meaning of art. An example:""Caring too much for objects can destroy you. Only—if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn’t it? And isn’t the whole point of things—beautiful things—that they connect you to some larger beauty?""It was almost a learning experience, reading this book. It is about Theo's life, yes, but themes like friendship, addiction, hope and morality make it meaningful on a whole other level. Theo's constant struggle to discern right from wrong had me questioning what I would do in his situation.I can't write this review without mentioning Boris. He gets his own little paragraph here. He does not show up for the first 260 pages, and later disappears from the plot again. No matter though, because Tartt spent enough time writing about him for me to be blown AWAY. He is intricate, fearless, sensitive, and somehow a great friend to Theo while still being 100% toxic — I constantly had to question myself because it felt... wrong to love this character so much (certain scenes between Theo and Boris had me laughing out loud though, so that definitely lifted some of that heaviness). When Boris showed up again near the end of the book (at this point he is an adult), I was a bit disappointed. He lost most of his charm in the time he was gone. He still kept the good quotes coming, though:
""Because you are not mad, or wild, or grieving! You are not roaring out to choke her with your own bare hands! Which means your soul is not too mixed up with hers. And that is good. Here is my experience. Stay away from the ones you love too much. Those are the ones who will kill you.""
I liked that so much of the Dutch culture is explored. Everything Dutch feels bland to me because I live in the Netherlands, but Tartt put everything in a different perspective. It was actually fun to read about!Bottom line is: this book is great. It could have used some more editing, and I closed the book feeling slightly unsatisfied, but that Pulitzer Prize was well-earned.✿✿✿✿✿✿✿Additional Notes:- The film adaptation has Finn Wolfhard playing the part of Boris.

What if our badness and mistakes are the very thing that set our fate and bring us round to good?... Because, here's the truth: life is catastrophe.
What a marvellous storyteller Tartt is! Despite a leisurely pace akin to Victorian 3-volume novels, and almost 900 pages, this never flagged for me - and the final couple of hundred pages speed up to grip so securely that I was up till 3.00 am unable to settle to sleep till I had finished.In one way, this is the most protracted tale of PTSD and 'survivor guilt' that I've ever read; in another, it's a reworking of a Dickens bildungsroman, Great Expectations mostly, for me, with touches of David Copperfield, a humorous reference to Oliver Twist and a setting of an antique shop (The Old Curiosity Shop - mercifully with no Quilp!)The pacing is leisurely after a, literally, explosive first chapter so it's best to adjust your mindset and enjoy the journey without worrying too much about the destination - though Tartt never wavers in terms of where she's going, there are a lot of scenic stops en route. The writing is elegant with a lavishness that is itself Dickensian; and the characters, in all their eccentricities and foibles, leap off the page. Be prepared for orphans, irresponsible fathers, surrogate parents, frauds and conspiracies, drugs and alcohol as a form of self-harming, grief, guilt and unbearable loss - but also love: for a painting, for a girl who becomes a woman, for a boy who becomes a wayward but loyal friend. There is a moral journey here and part of Theo's growing up is to recognise both how similar he is to his father, and how not to be him. Through this protracted story, characters grow, age and develop - and the painting of The Goldfinch is both a symbol of possession to which Theo clings, tied to it as an emblem of his past, just as the bird is chained to its perch; and, ultimately, is an object which he has to let go in order to forge a future. Tartt ends on a note of hope but is never saccharine, and ends are left loose and free rather than tied up neatly and resolved. If you like your fiction direct and brisk, this may well frustrate - but I found this immersive (yes, like Dickens...) where the network of characters and incidents form the contours of a world which we inhabit through these pages. The idea of a literary moral education may feel old-fashioned in our postmodern world but Tartt has succeeded in writing a Victorian/Dickensian novel for our times. And can I just say, I loved Boris!"

152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matt-quann,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt is a long novel that I believe will be best served with a long review. Thus, in brief: this is one of the finest novels I've ever read in my life and I encourage you to pick it up, clear your schedule, and settle in for a long, complicated, and beautiful read.  Now for the long bit. I've been trying to reconcile how to present my complete adoration for this book in a way that would express just how much of an obsession overcame me in just the little over a week it took me to read. There is the fact that, when in contact with other humans, I waited for even the most tenuous relation to the novel to be brought up in conversation so that I could gush over it. Yet perhaps most appropriate is to imagine how I would react to someone sitting across from me, telling me that they didn't enjoy the book. I suppose that I'd completely disown this person, regardless of their relationship with me, shun them in public, and put out a cigarette on their favourite piece of furniture. I'd be forced to leave the country so as to never encounter them again in my life and suffer their deplorable opinions. Alternatively (and much more likely), I might just say ""Huh, well, different strokes, eh?""Where to begin with why I fell in love with this book? First, our narrator. Theo Decker's voice is rich, detailed, and Tartt's writing is almost lyrical in how easily it reads. There were passages rendered so vividly that I could see myself in Theo's shoes, empathize with him in the extreme, and be forced to restrain myself from pumping my fist as he succeeded. Though Theo's journey is fraught with depressing and dark events, the characters in the novel provide comic relief and a healthy contrast to Theo's bleak narration. Boris, Mrs. Barbour, Hobie, Pippa, Xandra, Andy, and all the rest of the cast are so well realized that I felt as if I were saying goodbye to friends as I closed the last pages of the book. If for nothing else, I will revisit the book to spend time with them again. For God's sake, the dog in the book is memorable. Yet as good as the characters might be, none of it would matter without a compelling story. Luckily, The Goldfinch has an exceptionally taut storyline as it bounds between examinations of life post-trauma, criminal activity, a section that is focused almost entirely on taking drugs, why art is important, and, of course, love. Without giving too much away, The Goldfinch follows Theo Decker following the death of his mother during a terrorist attack in a museum. In the ensuing panic, Theo seizes Fabritus' famous painting of The Goldfinch and his life becomes a quilt of mishaps, each square in the pattern more different than the last. See-sawing between introspective sections and periods that read almost like a thriller, this one isn't at all boring. The storyline genuinely shocked me at more than a few occasions and despite the fact that it changes direction many times, I never felt as if it were false to the story. On the contrary, in a book so large, it is refreshing to have such a shifting foundation beneath the characters so that you never know what to expect.  Despite my tirade above, I could see why some readers might not enjoy the book. Theo's narration could be taken as whiney and melancholy throughout, though I never found it to be so. To understand the depth of Theo's loss, the desperation to which he sinks, and the decisions he makes it is essential to know how he feels, what he is thinking. Though it could be seen as progressing for much longer than it should, it is also undeniable that Theo could suffer for the reverberations of the trauma he felt throughout the years, despite the mask he wears in public. With that said, the misadventures of Theo and the misfortune that finds him during the novel should keep readers engaged despite a dislike for the narrator.  Well, that's about it isn't it? There is a great deal more I could go into, but why do that when you can dig in yourself? ""The Goldfinch"" is an undertaking, there is no doubt about it, but it is easily one of the most rewarding reads I've ever had. It is easily one of my all-time favourite books, and though I don't usually re-read, I will definitely be pulling this one off the shelf in the future. The ending, though not entirely what I expected, was also fulfilling and deeply philosophical, and will keep me reflecting for weeks and weeks. I've said enough here that if it hasn't convinced you to read it, I doubt much more writing on my part will turn the tide. Pick this one up folks, it is well worth your time."
153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27528763-gary,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was another immersive, well crafted book by this author. I finished her other two books in the order they were written prior to reading this and I felt that her development as a writer was apparent. Also apparent were themes that she utilizes in each of the three books (such as a major illness attacking the protagonist and killing fueled angst) to develop mood, atmosphere, and tension. She replicates anxiety extremely well- I felt anxious along with the character as he waited to see if he would get arrested. She has an uncanny ability to bring a setting to life. While I am not personally familiar with the each place as I have not personally visited them all, she is able to create her world effectively. This novel plunges the reader into a world of stolen art, drugs and antiques that made me feel like I had visited it from a safe distance.Her real talent lies in bringing the moment to life. As with her other two novels, the overarching plot hangs in the background seemingly forgotten. Yet the moment drew me into it with her vivid descriptions of the scene, realistic and likable characters and philosophical ponderings. There are times where I felt that this book, much like the painting in the story, was a work of art. Readers that want the plot to move may well get impatient with this story, but the beauty of it is often in its digression. Part of the immersiveness of her writing style in the intricacy and attention to detail that will either seem tedious or engaging depending on reader preference.Her writing has evolved through each of these three books and this is by far the most polished of the three. Much of what is familiar is welcome rather than repetitive. The sense of irony and concept of fate symbolized in so many ways in this story leads to a somewhat surprising and completely satisfying ending.Highly recommended for patient readers with a taste for irony and philosophy."

Voy a caer en la chotez: ""El jilguero"" da para una película. De Tarantino. O mejor, de Scorsese y que dure tres horas. O mejor aún, de Scorsese con diálogos de Tarantino.Llego tarde un par de años al fenómeno que fue cuando se editó. Soy un fetichista de los premios literarios - de los que se dan a obras publicadas, aclaro, como el estadounidense Pulitzer, el británico Man Bookers y el francés Goncourt. Cuando era joven los desdeñaba con el argumento de que estos premios son conservadores por definición; nunca reconocen lo revolucionario al momento que ocurre. Sigo estando de acuerdo con eso, pero ahora entiendo que lo que premian tiene una base de calidad garantizada. Y también es verdad es que a los 40 años, con dos niños, tal vez yo mismo me haya vuelto conservador. ""El Jilguero"" ganó el Pulitzer en el 2014.

ومختلفة.ولكن أحكام الجمال تتعلق بأمور الذوق. الذي ربما ليس له أساس عقلاني، وعليه، كيف لنا أن نفسر المكانة الرفيعة للجمال في حياتنا؟ ولماذا يجب علينا أن نندب حقيقة أن الجمال يختفي من عالمنا؟ ولمحاولة فهم هذا الرواية، اعتقد أننا لابد أن نمتلك الحد الأدنى من تقدير جمال التفاصيل، تفاصيل نظرات البشر ولمساتهم، تفاصيل ذلك الوجود البشري في حياتها، لنعرف فعلا ما يحدث عند فقد أحدهم من حياتنا، وأحدهم هنا يبدأ من بواب عمارتنا إلى أقرب الأقربين لنا، إلى الأم، الأم بكل ما تعنيه الكلمة، من حضور أنثوي أول في حياتنا، نراه في كل موجات غضبه ورقته وفتنته علينا، نرى وجبة الإفطار وأن تمسك يدنا عند عبور الشارع، وجيشنا الأول عند مواجهة أي خطر، وفجأة يختفي كل ذلك، لنرى حينها عَالمًا غير العَالم المعتادين عليه.قد نجد للرواية عنوان من مخيلتنا، وبعد الانتهاء منها، كل العناوين التي ستطرق خيالنا لها علاقة بالفن الإنساني، ذلك الإبداع المقدس والذي انتجه لنا آلاف البشر عبر التاريخ، فسنجد أن لوحة صغيرة اتقن صنعها فنان ما عاش في القرن السابع عشر، لوحة صغيرة الحجم لطائر، لوحة للوهلة الأولى قد تعتبرها عادية ولا تدري أن ذلك العمل قادر على تحويل حياة شخص ما، ولا نقدر أن نتخيل حياة لتلك اللوحة ذاتها، هذا ما فعلته الكاتبة دونا تارت، صنعت حياة للوحة الحسّون المرسومة عام 1654 للرسام الهولندي كارل فابريتيوس، ومعها صنعت حياة ثيو (الصبي اليتيم)، وجمعت بين الحياتين لتنتج لنا ملحمة أدبية من الطراز الرفيع.تبدأ الرواية بزيارة أم وإبنها المُعاقَب من المدرسة إلى متحف نيويوركي استعدادًا لمقابلة أستاذه، ونكتشف حينها ذوق الأم الرفيع واستمتاعها بكل فن جميل في العالم، ونجدها تحاول زرع ذلك الجمال في نفس ابنها، فتقول له: هذة روعة خالصة ، جنة حقيقية ، هَكذا كَانت تقول وهي غارقة في كُتب الفن ، أو وهي تَنظُر من جديد إلي السلايدات القديمة نفسها "" لوحات لمونيه وفوييار "" إلي أن تزوغ عيناها ( كانت تَقول : هَذا جنون ، لَكني سأكون سَعيدة تماماً إذا أستطعت الجلوس والنظر إلي هذة اللوحات القديمة نفسها طيلة ما بقي من حياتي ، لا يُمكنني التَفكير في طريقة أفضل من أجل الأصابة بالجنون .وفي خضم استمتاعهم بالفن الرفيع يحدث انفجار مروّع تموت فيه الأم وينجو الصبي بمعجزة، وخلال ذلك تقع عينيه على فتاة يجد قلبه طريقه إليها، فتاة في مثل عمره تمسك بيد جدها، وحاول أن يتبعها ليقول لها كلمة أو اثنتين، لتكون لحظات مراقبته لها هي من أنقذت حياته، وعند مغادرته لموقع الانفجار يجد الجد العجوز يحتضر ليخوض معه نقاش صغير يقول فيه الجد ما يقوله المحتضر، ويعطيه خاتمه، ولم يكن الطفل يعلم أن ذلك النقاش سيغير حياته، ولم يشعر في ظل الكارثة بأنه خرج من المتحف بلوحة صغيرة.ثم تتابع حياته بين نقله للسكن مع أسرة صديق له، أسرة ثرية، يسودها النظام الصارم والتربية الأرستقراطية الغنية، لينتقل بين حيوية الحياة وحرارتها إلى برودة التعامل، وبين ابتسامة والدته الحانية، إلى ابتسامة والدة صديقه المتصنعة التي لا تتغير، ويعرف حينها أن فراق أمه قد ترك تفاصيلها في كل شيء، وتوقفت حياته عند ال13 من عمره، لم يمت مع أمه ولكنها بقيت حيّة بداخله تدفعه دايما، وتترآى حوله، واكتشف هذا الصبي أنه لم يهرب من الانفجار بمفرده، بل هربت معه لوحة كان مقدر له ولها، أن يقتسم حياته معها.ثم يظهر أباه السكير في الصورة فجأة، يظهر بعد أن هجر زوجته وابنه، يظهر في نفس الوقت الذي يكاد الصبي تجاوز الصدمة، وتبدأ حياته في الاستقرار الجديد مع عائلته الغنية الجديدة، ليأخذه الأب الفاسد في رحلة معه تتجدد معه آلامه وحزنه وخاصة برفقة والده وصديقته الجديدة والتي كانت سيئة معه، تشعره أكثر وأكثر بمعنى الفقد، ولا يمر كثير من الوقت حتى يموت أبو الصبي، ويرفض جده استقباله، ليعاني من خسارة كل أهله، وتبدأ دائرته من البداية، ويعود طيف لقاءه القصير مع العجوز المحتضر لينقذه من جديد.إذا فهي رواية عن الفقد، تقرأها لتعرف أن ما يفعله الحزن فينا يفوق بآلاف المرات مرأى الدمع في أعيننا، ومرأى الكآبة على وجوهنا، نعرف حينها أن الفقد يعني شيء من الروح يسافر ولا يرجع، تشرح كل ذلك بتفاصيل دقيقة، ملهمة ومستلهمة من أروع إبداعات البشر الأدبية والفنية، وضعتها الكاتبة بثقافتها الموسوعية بين سطور الأحداث والتفاصيل الروائية.تتحرك حياة بطلنا الصبي ثيو كما يتحرك الموج، تتجاذبه الحياة فتلين معه تارة وتشتد تارة أخرى، وهو يخوض غمارها كما تدفعه عاطفته وغريزته التي تطورت ونمت بفعل تجارب الحياة التي فُرضت عليه، يدمن على المخدرات�� وينصب في بيع التحف، ويبرع فيها، يحب فتاة ملكت قلبه ولم تحبه هي، يموت أعز أصدقائه دون معرفته، يموت أبيه في ظروف مأساوية مريرة، يتعامل مع رجال العصابات وأرباب السجون، ويتعامل أيضا مع صفوة المجتمع وسيداته، ويخرج من كل ذلك بحكمة جديدة وتجربة تزيده صلادة.تحتل مشاهد الموت والفراق في الرواية إتقان أدبي منقطع النظير، الكاتبة قادرة على التعبير الإنساني ومشاعر الإنسان بملكة أدبية، قادرة على أن تسطر الحزن لنراه أمامنا رؤيا العين، فنشعر به كأننا نعانيه، فتجد في وسط تدفقها البديع في وصف الحدث جملة تقع في قلوبنا وتستقر ومن هذه الجُمل: الناس يموتون. هذا صحيح، لكننا نفقد الأشياء على نحو غير ضروري، على نحو يحطم القلوب، نفقدها بفعل الإهمال الصرف، الحرائق، والحروب.وعندما تتحدث عن الحب وما يعترك بداخل أرواحنا من شوق وود للبشر نجد القراءة تهدأ وتسكن النفس مستمتعة بما تقرأه وتجد أمام عينيها: ومهما يكن سبب ذلك غبيًا، فقد كنت أجامل نفسي دائمًا بالقول إنني الشخص الوحيد في العالم الذي يقدرها حق قدرها، ستصيبها الدهشة وتتأثر كثيرًا لو عرفت كم أراها جميلة، بل يمكن حتى أن تبدأ النظر إلى نفسها بعين مختلفة، لكن هذا لم يحدث أبدا.وعندما تتحدث عن الحزن البشري، نجدها ترسم ذلك الشعور الذي ينخر فينا نخر السوس في الخشب، فتقول في وصفه : لكن كلمة اكتئاب لم تكن وصفا صالحا لتلك الحالة. كان الأمر غوصًا عميقا في بحر واسع من حزن وقرف يتجاوزان كثيرا ما هو شخصي: إحساس مريض مشبّع بالغثيان تجاه البشر وتجاه كل ما سعى إليه البشر منذ فجر الزمان. اشمئزاز عنيف من النظام البيولوجي كله. الشيخوخة، والمرض، والموت. لا مهرب لأي إنسان من هذه البشاعة كلها! وحتى من يكون جميلا، فهو ليس أكثر من ثمرة طرية ناضجة موشكة على الفساد. لكن الناس-لا أدري كيف- يواصلون المضاجعة والتوالد وإنتاج طعام جديد للقبور. ليس إنتاج المزيد والمزيد من الكائنات الجديدة حتى تعاني على هذا النحو شيئا حسنا، ولا شيئا مخلصا، ولا حتى شيئا أخلاقيا يدعو إلى الإعجاب: بل جر مزيدا من المخلوقات البريئة إلى هذه اللعبة الخاسرة أبدًا. أطفال صغار يسيرون متثاقلين مرتبكين، وأمهات راضيات عن فعلتهن وقد خدّرت الهرمونات عقولهن.وحينها نعرف أننا فقط لا نقرأ مجرد رواية جميلة، ثرية، دسمة، بل نجد أننا نقرأ أنفسنا. كل ما في الرواية جميل، شخصيات مرسومة باحترافية عالية، خُلقت من رحم الحياة ووجدت طريقها على الورق، مرسومة بعناية شديدة فلا تجد فارق بينها وبين شخصيات العالم الحقيقي الذي نعيشه، وأحداث منطقية مترابطة، وقد نجد هنا نوع من الإعجاز، فعلى الرغم من ضخامة الرواية (أكثر من 1100 صفحة بالعربية) إلا أنك تجدها محكمة، كسلسلة طويلة كاملة الحلقات، أحداثها تتدافع بفعل الشخصيات وتصرفاتهم، وعند الحديث عن وصف الكاتبة، فلابد من الوقوف كثيرا عند مقدرتها المذهلة وثقافتها المهولة في شتى المجالات، ولكنك ستجد نفسك باحثا عن كم كبير من الكتب واللوحات الفنية والأفلام السينمائية والأحداث التاريخية، بل حتى طرق تصليح الأشياء، مدفوعا بسحر الحكي والسرد اللذان امتلكتهم الكاتبة.في المطلق: هذه الرواية عمل فريد، يجمع بين الكلاسيكية الأصيلة التي تعيد لنا ذكريات أعمال عظيمة من ديكنز وحتى دستويفسكي وماركيز، وفي نفس الوقت لم تفقد عصريتها وروح عصرها، عمل يجعلك تعترف بقيمة الأدب كرسالة خالدة حيّة قادرة على إعادة التوازن لحياة البشر."
160,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11501632-boris,Rating 5 out of 5," За реализма Толстой и Достовевски? Автори на едни от най-великите литературни произведения - Ана Каренина, Идиот, Братя Карамазови, Война и Мир - все книги, които са си заслужили определението ""произведения на изкуството"". Характерни със своя стил - реализъм, те продължават да вълнуват поколенията в продължение на над сто години.Умишлено си направих труда да спомена точно тези книги, защото те за мен са вечни, непреходни и изключително убедителни в това, че животът е повече от помия и кал. Те са диаманти в короната на реализма, съвършено демонстрират как работи този жанр и какъв ефект има над индивида, и честно казано не вярвах, че ще прочета нещо, което надскача тяхната стойност.С ""Щиглецът"" Дона Тарт прави истински каламбур от жанра реализъм и тотално унищожава ефекта на всички романи, писани по правилата му и създава един нов краен реализъм.Романът ""Щиглецът""е като литературна реплика на идеята за съвършения реализъм в изобразителното изкуство, сътворена в картината Щиглецът на Фабриций. Дона съвсем съзнателно пише историята с разграничения в композицията и съдържанието й, които целят да ни разкажат не само историята сама по себе си, а и да ни покажат как е написана - подобно на техниката, с която Фабрициус е нарисувал ""Щиглецът"", Дона Тарт огледално я копира и пресътворява ефекта й в литература. Щигелцът (роман) има фабула, която от първа страница до последната се разгръща с всички смислови части на един класически сюжет, сюжета е съгласуван с темите, които дискутира; авторката има поетичен, ритмичен език и убедителни герои; във всичко това майсторски е вплела самостоятелни части, внасящи абстрактност, извън цялата кохерентност на книгата Това превръща ""Щиглецът"" не само в история, а и във връзка, нексус, между ключовите моменти в човешкия живот и всичко останалото, което просто преминава покрай нас. Четеш на едно ниво разказът на героят, а на съвсем друго ниво четеш разказа на собствените си преживявания и опити - било то с помощта на метафорични картини, образи или събития или без тяхната помощ - според зависи. Двойнственост, която за мен  премина  в основната тема на ""Щиглецът"". За двойственото""Щиглецът"" е обемен роман. И това не е никак случайно или самоцелно. Дона Тарт започва и тази своя книга с разгръщането и дискутирането на микро теми, чийто генезис се проследява до по-мащабни идеи и създава своеобразна класификация на съществуването. Загубата и притежанието еволюират в по-високия си таксон - зависимостите и независимостите, а те от своя страна водят то климакса в последните страници - двойнствеността между неприятната реалност и ключовите моменти в човешкия живот, които правят поносима помията на реалността.За абсурдите Абсурдността буташе по-голямата част от разказа на героя и щеше да бъде банално, но Дона Тарт е много по-добра от това и успя да превърне тези абсурди в едно сюрреалистично преживяване, в каквото реалността съжителства постоянно. За феминизма Каквото Набоков успява да постигне с умишленото избягване на политически алегории във времена, в които 1984 е била стандарт за литература-изкуство, Дона Тарт успява по сходен начин да избегне феминизирането на романа си, да избяга от женски глас и вместо това да предложи един универсален глас. Да, главният герой е мъж, но смятам, че както мъже, така и жени могат да се асоциират с него. За мен това е най-доброто, което жена писател може да направи за всички жени писатели. За нехаресването и харесването на ""Щиглецът"" Разбирам хората, които не харесват Щиглецът. Не виждам как можеш да харесваш тази книга, ако в своя живот нямаш своята Одри, своят Лари, своят Борис, своята Пипа, своят Хоуби, своята г-ба Барбър, своята Китси, своят Анди."

She emoted that feeling within me while reading of Theo’s survivors guilt and depression after the events at the beginning of the book. The pure feeling of devastation that Tartt described had me gripped to the story.The part that I found went on too long for my liking was the middle of the book- perhaps after 300 pages. While I still read it with some attention, the happenings of this part of the book seemed to drag for me. This section of the book also includes new high school experiences, a lot of drug use and parental abuse (as a trigger warning). The last 100 pages of this book then headed toward a crescendo of events that kept me captured.Throughout this book there is a feeling of bleakness, grief and depression- Tartt’s descriptions of this as well as the settings/places events that take place are completely atmospheric. Despite not being to any of the places or countries mentioned in the novel, a vivid picture could be painted. Her descriptions of Theo’s inner turmoils made me empathise with the character and I kept those feelings of grief and darkness churning while reading this book. Very emotive with some hope at the end left it at a rather satisfying read. "

One of the five star reviewers of this novel quoted the following as an example of the ""amazing"" writing contained within:  ”Mrs. Barbour was from a society family with an old Dutch name, so cool and blonde and monotone that sometimes she seemed partially drained of blood. She was a masterpiece of composure; nothing ever ruffled her or made her upset, and though she was not beautiful her calmness had the magnetic pull of beauty--a stillness so powerful that the molecules realigned themselves around her when she came into a room.”  If this paragraph was a horse, I would shoot it to put it out of its misery and then turn it into glue.It is all very well to reject ""elitism"" in an effort to encourage the participation of the majority, but the insurmountable fact remains that the majority of human beings are bloody idiots.

164,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri,Rating 4 out of 5,"Parts of “The Goldfinch” I loved. Parts of it I hated. At times I was overwhelmed by how disturbing it was, and more times I was overwhelmed with Donna Tartt’s lovely writing. Theo is a young boy living in NYC with his mother. His father has left the picture, so to speak, and Theo is happy enough with things the way they are, his mother is lovely, gracious and kind, a lover of the arts. His absent father, a Vegas playboy. Theo’s young, so his character goes through a lot of changes through this story, sometimes his story is sad enough to make you feel sorry for him, other times he’s just not as likeable. Many characters in “The Goldfinch” are not likeable, the majority perhaps, and Theo seems to be a beacon for them all. There are the few characters who help Theo find himself, help him find the man who he would have been had not his life taken this terrible turn. This is not a novel that you can’t put down, you should put it down. At 755 pages and more twists and turns and characters and changes in time and space it’s simply too much for one sitting. It is not an easy or fun read, and yet even during those sections I didn’t much care for, it was still compelling and, in parts, beautiful. ""I don't care what anyone says or how often or winningly they say it: no one will ever, ever be able to persuade me that life is some awesome, rewarding treat. Because, here's the truth: life is catastrophe. The basic fact of existence—of walking around trying to feed ourselves and find friends and whatever else we do—is catastrophe. Forget all this ridiculous 'Our Town' nonsense everyone talks: the miracle of a newborn babe, the joy of one simple blossom, Life You Are Too Wonderful To Grasp, &c. For me—and I'll keep repeating it doggedly till I die, till I fall over on my ungrateful nihilistic face and am too weak to say it: better never born, than born into this cesspool. Sinkhole of hospital beds, coffins, and broken hearts. No release, no appeal, no “do-overs” to employ a favorite phrase of Xandra’s, no way forward but age and loss, and no way out but death …. does it make any sense to know that it ends badly for all of us, even the happiest of us, and that we all lose everything that matters in the end—and yet to know as well, despite all this, as cruelly as the game is stacked, that it’s possible to play it with a kind of joy?"""

I had favorite sections while others left me restless and annoyed. And overall I thought it was a bit anti-climatic. And bloated (that's all you, Maciek!). But those years that Theo lived in Vegas? And Boris? Perfection. Their friendship left me heartsore. Then there is the fact that I married an Andy. Again, heartsore. The art-lover in me loved looking up all the paintings referenced: Vermeer's The Love Letter, Caravaggio's Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence, Picasso's Poverty to name a few. And I have been listening to Arvo Part since (many thanks songza). Also Belle and Sebastian. But back to the story- it is one of self-realization.

With vividly described and engaging characters; some to love and some to abhor, the beginning of the story pulled me in with a horrific act of terror, and my love for antiquities kept me glued to the pages thereafter. While reviews are all across the board for this Pulitzer Prize Winner, I for one loved it and am so glad I finally decided to read it.The emotional and memorable last paragraph of the novel will stay with me for some time, but by far my favorite quote in the book, (of which there are many to admire) was early on when Theo said: ""Very softly ---- so softly I could barely hear her ---- I heard the girl whisper: It had to live its whole life like that?"". Carel Fabritius' 1654 painting of THE GOLDFINCH breaks my heart. "

The ending was comme ci comme ca, definitely not the grand finale one might expect after trodding through this mountain of a book. Again and again, I discover that Tartt's writing, although engaging enough, is not for me, and I wholeheartedly hope that the hype around her next book will not trick me again to tackle these bricks, only to discover what I already know - my reading time could be spent much more enjoyably elsewhere."
168,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4268487-dustin,Rating 3 out of 5,"What better way that start this review with Stephen King's blurb?“The Goldfinch is a rarity that comes along perhaps half a dozen times per decade, a smartly written literary novel that connects with the heart as well as the mind."" First and foremost, I’d like to thank my good friend, Stepheny Zimmerman, whose enthusiastic review and passion for The Goldfinch helped convince me to read it. I will never regret this experience, and Theo’s journey will stick with me for a long time. I went into this expecting greatness, but partly due to some mixed reviews (more on those later,) my heart was simultaneously anxious. The fear was harboring its heathen in my gut. I was afraid of it for the same reason I’m afraid of any overtly hyped story: because the reality cannot possibly match our expectations.  Meet thirteen year old Theodore Decker, who loves his mother very much. But on that fateful day, his love for her is the last thing on his mind. Much larger things, like surviving a deadly terrorist attack, consume it instead. And delivering an age-old and priceless painting entitled, The Goldfinch.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gol... My initial impression of the novel was the abundance of detail, both small and significant. It isn’t just verbose, Tartt’s prose is shot clean through with sensory stimuli. This Mississippi native achieves this immersive juggling act like no one I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. She has a deep understanding of fiction, alongside an equally keen perception of the human condition. She also portrays memory (a recurring theme,) with a poetlike hand, expressing its genuine-often misunderstood—truth, which is thus: our memories can’t be trusted. We remember our past as we’d prefer them to be. Or in certain situations, we can’t remember them at all.   In Theo, we see memories taking on an almost monstrous form, one which he’s loathe to acknowledge. At the same time, he’s wallowing in the past, before everything changed. Before his world was turned and shaken violently. Sometimes, he even he revels in those darkest of days, in pits of despair. But he never fools himself in believing in false truths. Those awful things actually happened.  Donna Tartt pulls this off, and she does it very well. She’s able to do this by developing an intimate friendship with Theo, by spending countless hours with him and as a result, is permitted access into his mind. We see how he perceives reality and acts upon it, both of which are shown by his internal dialogue. It’s a beautiful thing. But they also inform his fight-or-flight mentality in ways that I cannot quite fathom. I can’t put into words how she wrote said scene, let alone the mastery of it. Nine months later, my mind is still reeling, to some degree or another. I’ll never forget it, nor would I want to. It’s best not to divulge many secrets, though. Instead, I’d like to skim over the intervening years, formerly called adolescence. Armed with his remembrances-both happy and depressing—Theo must learn to navigate the often perilous trenches of life in a world which has become drenched in premarital sex, drugs and complacency. He must learn the merits of genuine friendship, and the hardships that come with it. More than anything, he must learn to trust again, and learn how to foster friendships. One likeminded individual named Boris, an immigrant of Russia, may just hold the key to all of these things and more, if only he’d let him…but will he? That’s easier said than done with an obstinate past and secrets to unfold. And a particularly trying case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) doesn’t help matters, either. Distrust issues and recurring nightmares complicate matters further. But there is good, too. And there is hope. How can he possibly expect to survive such dire circumstances? Could you? Will he? Throughout The Goldfinch, Tartt seasons it liberally with the Arts. Not just Carel Fabritius’ iconic work, but with a plethora of other artists of his time, like Egbert van der Poel and Rembrandt and, taken from more modern times, Pablo Picasso. Tartt takes her obvious passion much further, with almost casual references to Great Expectations and Walden; Wind, Sand and Stars by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry; Hispanic painter and muralist, Diego Rivera; Carson McCullers' The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath. Further yet, Silas Marner by the incomparable George Eliot, a 1948 Italian film entitled, The Bicycle Thief, as well as The Misfits, starring Marilyn Monroe. Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the American poet Hart Crane infamous for his method of suicide. ”We being around thee forgot to die…”-Yone Nuguchi, Spirit Of Fuji Mountain, circa 1903The architecture of Herengracht, Amsterdam. The music of The Velvet Underground. Yet another artist, Jan Weenix, the poetry of W.B. Yeats. I could go on, but I won’t. You get the idea. Now, as elegant and compelling as this may sound, The Goldfinch is by no means an easy read. I almost gave it up on more than one occasion. I kept going for a couple reasons: 1.) I was fully invested in Theo’s character; 2.) I needed to know where the story was going, and how it would end; 3.) I had to know what all the hype was about, and why my friend, Stepheny, loves it as much as she does. During this time, I began to search online for articles for and against the novel. Some adamantly claimed its virtues, while others basically assured me that it was okay to throw in the towel. These both gave me hope and rendered me more anxious than ever before. As a result, I made a deal with myself. In it, I said that I’d persevere to five hundred pages in (out of seven hundred seventy-two,) and if it hadn’t gotten considerably better by then, I would let it go. Given that much time and effort, a typical novel should have enthrall the reader-any reader—by then. So I kept reading, day by day, hour by frustrating hour, week by week. Curiously, I made it just under the five hundred mark when the plot really started to pick up. By then, I pretty much couldn’t couldn’t stop thinking about it. How would it turn out? Would Theo survive? What about the fate of the supporting cast? How might they be effected? I had to know. It was a deep-set desire. I won’t disclose how it ends, obviously. But I will say this: I was earnestly afraid of a big-big letdown. I needn’t worry though, because Tartt didn’t disappoint me one bit. What’s more, her exposition is incredibly profound and beautiful and dang near flawless. It’s sheer mastery at its finest. For example:  ""...he used to speak of how with very great painting it's possible to know them deeply, inhabit them almost, even through copies. Even Proust—there’s a famous passage where Odette opens the door with a cold, she’s sulky, her hair is loose and undone, her skin is patchy, and Swann, who has never about her until that moment, falls in love with her because she looks like a Botticeli girl from a slightly damaged fresco. Which Proust himself only knew from a reproduction. He never saw the original, in the Sistine Chapel…”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bir...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandro_...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_... And wrapping it up:""That Nature (meaning Death) always wins but that doesn’t mean we have to bow and grovel to it. That maybe even if we’re not always so glad to be here, it’s our task to immerse ourselves anyway: wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open. And in the midst of our dying, as we rise from the organic and sink back ignominiously into the organic, it is a glory and a privilege to love what Death doesn’t touch. For if disaster and oblivion have followed this painting down through time — so too has love. Insofar as it is immortal (and it is) I have a small, bright, immutable part in that immortality. It exists; and it keeps on existing. And I add my own love to the history of people who have loved beautiful things, and looked out for them, and pulled them from the fire, and sought them when they were lost, and tried to preserve them and save them while passing them along literally from hand to hand, singing out brilliantly from the wreck of time to the next generation of lovers, and the next.” Like the pivotal scene that I touched on near the beginning, the last twenty of so pages knock me off of my feet still, and I cannot properly describe them. I doubt I even comprehend it fully, it’s so deep and touching. And the latter passages barely scratch the surface of their spellbinding greatness. For these few scenes alone, the novel deserved an additional star. I’m giving it four stars instead of three, which I’d held firmly in my mind for weeks, after much consideration. Thank you, Donna Tartt, for letting me see the world in a whole other light.UPDATE: 4.1.2017 I can't do it, folks. I thought I could, and at the time the additional star felt RIGHT in my heart, but in the intervening days, I've thought about it some more, and I must stick with a strong three stars. Despite its mixed reception, The Goldfinch was the recipient of a score of awards, including the Pulitzer for Fiction in 2014, and was shortlisted the year before for the National Book Critics Circle Award, as well as the Baileys Women’s Prize for Fiction, amongst others. And typical of most best-sellers, Hollywood is currently in the process of adapting Theo’s journey for the silver screen. This, in itself, is controversy.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/t... I’m still kind of at a loss for words, for thought, et al. Where exactly is the disparity? How do you explain the disconnect regarding the novel’s mass appeal, its laudatory reception? There’s a part of me that totally understands it, and another that quite simply does not get it all the hype. I cannot fathom its apparent precariousness which isn’t-for it can’t be—so random.  All things fall and are built again."

The sheer length…so many words used to often describe fairly mundane events. Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn’t. The first half kept me thoroughly enthralled and fighting the urge to flip the pages as fast as I could so I could slow down and savor the beauty of the writing. The second half didn’t quite live up to its earlier promise and the story became a bit of a slog at times. There were too many unlikely coincidences and improbable plot twists used solely to move the story along. Lastly, I found the pseudo-philosophical musings of our narrator at the end of the book preachy and tacked on solely to give the book “meaning”. But then there’s the good. The writing itself is simply stunning. The characters are well-developed and the settings so real I felt as if I were there on the pages with the characters. Boris is undoubtedly one of literature’s most colorful and memorable characters. Hobie…well, I absolutely loved him. Who wouldn't want a Hobie in their life?! Theo? I started out feeling a great amount of sympathy for his plight but ended up frustrated and disgusted by him. Other character, like Pippa, weren't quite so developed. But for most of the characters, it's impossible to not feel strongly about them, one way or another.It’s a rare book that can justify nearly 800 pages. I probably would have loved this book even more with a brutal editor. Ultimately, my rating reflects the fact that this is a book I simply can’t forget. Even weeks later, I find myself thinking about it often and wanting to discuss it with others who have read it. And that is a sign of a great read."

173,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,Rating 4 out of 5,"Theo Decker’s life changes forever after becoming one of the few survivors of a terrorist bombing at an art gallery. Not only does he lose his beloved mother in the attack but he rashly decides to take advantage of the unfolding chaos to steal Dutch impressionist Carel Fabritius’ painting, The Goldfinch, for reasons even he’s not sure about. Will he get away with it? And where does he go from here? As I knew I would having loved her previous two books, I really enjoyed Donna Tartt’s third novel, The Goldfinch - but then I wouldn’t have finished an 800+ page book if I hadn’t! And let’s address the length because that’s something everyone mentions about this one. The Goldfinch is a project! I think the somewhat excessive length is in large part due to Tartt’s writing style which I found quaintly anachronistic. She has to describe every detail in a scene, leaving nothing up to the reader’s imagination - she insists on making you see what she sees as accurately as possible which I can understand will be off-putting to some readers. Nor is she especially concerned with plot or pacing. Scores of pages can pass by spent entirely in Theo’s head as he goes about his daily life. And, while the loose story revolves around the stolen painting, it’s not as if there’s some wily detective hunting it down, nor is Theo trying to do anything but hold onto it, which he does with relative ease, so there’s nothing in the way of narrative tension or drive. Usually that kind of wanky naval-gazing (the technical term for this kind of novel is “Bildungsroman”) doesn’t sit well with me but Tartt is such a gifted writer that she’s able to hypnotise the reader into not caring about the trappings of modern fiction. This is largely due to her remarkable ability to craft unique and memorable characters who effortlessly capture and hold the attention so that it doesn’t matter that they’re not doing much but talk to each other. My favourite character by far was Boris, Theo’s childhood friend, a charming Russian kid who bonds with him over their shared familial situations: both have dead mothers and abusive fathers. Their adventures in Las Vegas were compelling and Tartt gives Boris a very personable and real voice. He’s a lot of fun to read about and he steals every scene he’s in - it’s easy to see why Theo likes him so much. But really all of her characters are skilfully brought to life, from the Jewish gangster Mr Silver to his mother’s lawyer friend Mr Bracegirdle, his endearingly gentle guardian Hobie, his father’s flaky girlfriend Xandra, and his tragic mother surrogate Mrs Barbour. Rarely do I read books with characters this richly realised. That style is what makes her writing seem anachronistic - specifically Dickensian. Which is appropriate, not just because Dickens wrote similarly dense and slow-moving books so acutely focused on character uber alles, but because The Goldfinch reads a lot like a modern retelling of Oliver Twist. Theo is Oliver, wrenched from his comfortable existence and thrust into a harsh life with a Fagin-esque father who tries to bilk him of his inheritance and an Artful Dodger best friend in Boris. (And, though I know they appeared in Great Expectations, Mrs Barbour and Pippa reminded me a lot of Miss Havisham and Estella. Hmm - Pippa = Pip, another nod to that novel?)That’s not to say it always works so well - some parts of the book are definitely tedious and far less engaging than others. Some of the upper class New York society scenes were dull and went on too long and I wasn’t into any aspect of the antiques trade, either reading about Hobie refurbishing furniture or Theo wheeling and dealing them. And, though the terrorist act that lights the narrative’s touchpaper was suitably exciting, a lot of the preamble up to it was uninteresting and excruciatingly sluggish. That preamble and first getting hit with Tartt’s unique way of writing and unhurried storytelling is why it’s taken me multiple attempts over the years to finally make it through the novel. But I knew it was going to be good once I eventually chose to persevere which is why I kept trying! It’s not totally a plotless book. There is the continual question of where Theo and the painting are going as well as a quietly tragic romance buried deep at the novel’s heart that’s very bittersweet. And I loved the whole Las Vegas episode which stands out as the most exciting part of the book. I can’t remember if it was this way with her other two novels (it’s been years) but Tartt really makes a hash of the ending here. She brings it around well so we get to see what happens to The Goldfinch itself and it’s all very satisfying but she spends way too many pages making Theo putz around not really doing anything. In that space she tries multiple times to give the novel various literary allusions and interpretations through the subject of the painting: a tethered bird. Which is fair as you could apply the image to numerous characters and situations here: Theo is metaphorically tethered to the painting for the entire book, as well as his doomed love Pippa, drugs, the mental scarring of the terrorist attack, his dead mother, and so on. In one line of reasoning, Tartt even posits that the novel is meaningless which it could well be but, if you accept the painting is as well, both are so well-crafted that that doesn’t make them worthless either. It just struck me as a messy and unimpressive way to end the book by artlessly lobbing one interpretation after another at the reader so obviously. But, clumsy attempts at highlighting that the book is to be considered Literature aside, it’s not hard to see why The Goldfinch won so many awards. Besides Tartt’s undeniable skill, it’s a great read with superb characters and many clever touches throughout. Carel Fabritius was killed in a gunpowder explosion much like the incident that Theo experiences at the start which connects him to Fabritius’ masterpiece. During Theo’s tortured time in Amsterdam, he walks the circular canal structure much like Dante’s circles of Hell. Besides Dickens’ Oliver Twist, there’s a case to be made for this being similar to another great writer’s famous work: F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby. Like Fitzgerald, Tartt is drawn to the upper classes and you could compare Theo and Boris to Nick Carraway and Gatsby, the inexperienced young man and the more worldly friend. Fitzgerald also implied that Nick was gay while Theo and Boris’s relationship is more expressly confirmed. There’s more I’m forgetting overall but there’s a lot of detail layered within this massive book to reward careful readers. I’m glad I finally read The Goldfinch. I found it to be a very entertaining, memorable and compelling experience in all of the ways only great books can be. I recommend it with the added note that if you’re going to read it, be patient with it - it is absolutely worth the effort! "
174,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6582211-rebbie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Note: This book won the Pulitzer Prize in 2014.And oh, boy, did she deserve it. I realize that not everyone will like this book, and of course that's to be expected. With that being said, it's important to note that she did an enormous amount of research for this novel, and it seems to be the kind of research that is a bit unusual for most novels, like antique forgery. But we'll get to that.The book begins with a 13 year old boy living in NYC with his mother, having been abandoned the previous year by his deadbeat father. Never in my life have I read a novel where two people are so incredibly mismatched as to have bumped pretties and made a child. But there you have it.Anyway, off he and his mother go to a museum, where there is a bomb that kills many people, including his mother. The writing of what happens to Theo in the minutes and hours after this attack are impeccable; it truly made me feel the emptiness, the complete loss and denial of a future that has been destroyed. Very rarely do things happen to people that are so traumatic and life altering as to shake our very foundation, but here it is and it's written like a masterpiece.So off Theo goes to live with a friend of his, Andy Barbour. Poor Andy has been severely bullied, thus retreating deep into his studies, quickly becoming one of those socially awkward people that make the rest of us uncomfortable because we know they are uncomfortable and there's absolutely nothing we can do to make them feel better. Theo had previously defended Andy from some of the worst of the bullying, yet showed enormous humility, which was quite telling when it came to showing the best side of him. I'm pointing this out because I believe that this incredibly wealthy, upper east side, old money family felt obligated to take him in because of this. So here's a little secret: Theo stole a priceless painting from the museum after the bomb. Maybe it's because of Welty, the dying man he tries to comfort immediately afterward, or maybe it's because he subconsciously knew his mother had died. For whatever the reason, psychologists could have a field day debating it.Fast forward a tiny bit, Theo befriends a long-term friend and business partner of Welty's, who repairs antiques. This man shows a loyalty and unconditional love for Theo that many of us have never been fortunate enough to receive, especially from someone not related to us by blood.Of course, a wrench is thrown into the mix when Theo's father comes back to claim the life insurance policy, err, I mean Theo. Does Mrs. Barbour really want to see him go? There are two schools of thought: either she's cold and aloof because of her old money upbringing, or she doesn't care and took him in out of obligation. I'm leaning toward the latter, because she never once asked him to write, or said anything to let him know that he was wanted in their home. Interesting note: when Theo sees her (along with the rest of the family), she behaves differently toward him. She's warm and inviting, showing a motherly side that she never did before. The cynic in me wholeheartedly believes that she had an ulterior motive for this, based on the circumstances and from reading between the lines. So when Theo's father cons to collect him, he brings along his new wife. It turns out that she's one of those flashy women, you know the type who wears neon acrylic nails, has straw-like bleached hair, a muffin top and wears cut off jeans that are far too short. And yet, I didn't find her totally unlikable. If Donna Tartt had given us more of her, I have the feeling that she might have won us over with her vulnerability.So off Theo goes to Las Vegas to live with his shady father and new stepmommy. And it's here where we meet Boris, an incredibly intelligent loner who becomes the type of best friend that most of us get once in a lifetime if we're lucky. Personally, I loved Boris. I wanted to rescue him, and hug him, and tell him that the world is not as cruel as he's always known it to be. Honestly, I could've read an entire book based on Boris alone.It's after Las Vegas where Theo learns that easy money could be made from forging antiques. Once he did that, there really was no turning back. The ball started rolling toward the climax of the book. I believe that Las Vegas was the dividing line in Theo's life; the decisions that he made during this time shaped his future. Would he have done the things he did in his twenties had it not been for Las Vegas? I don't think so. But life is complicated. Who we become and what we do is vastly different from who we believe we are when life is simple, and our foundation has yet to crack."

Mas depois de ultrapassar o tema tamanho, é um livro que vos agarra e não vos larga mais.Eu pouco sabia sobre a história, apenas que era sobre uma mãe e um filho. Theo Decker, um adolescente de 13 anos, vive em Nova Iorque com a mãe com quem partilha uma relação muito próxima, inesperadamente a mãe morre num acidente num Museu (logo no início do livro) e Theo fica praticamente sozinho, já que tem pouca família próxima.Prendeu-me logo desde as primeiras páginas, principalmente com as descrições sobre NY. É um livro que respira arte por todo o lado: quadros, esculturas, exposições, museus, antiguidades, literatura, todo o livro gira muito à volta de uma misteriosa pintura.Sobre a relação com a mãe, sobre os medos de perder uma mãe, sobre o medo de perder as pessoas de quem mais gostamos, medo de ficar sozinho no mundo, sobre o amor, sobre a sobrevivência, sobre a culpa, com algum suspense à mistura e muita arte.O Theo perdeu tudo e ficou desorientado, deslocado, esgotado, atordoado, arrasado, simplesmente a mais. A vida continua… Infelizmente o Mundo não pára só porque o nosso Mundo parou.É um livro muito muito triste, li-o sempre com o coração apertado, a história de vida do Theo é profundamente triste.Sei que o tamanho assusta mas lê-se bem. Não se lê num dia ou dois, mas vai-se lendo e com prazer.É um livro ao qual não se fica indiferente, é intenso, é pesado, é descritivo mas é impossível não dar 5🌟. "
176,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3263980-adam-dalva,Rating 4 out of 5,"Mega-addictive, genre-defying thriller. It reads like a book of half its length, and it falls into that magical category of novels that you turn the light back on for after you try to go to sleep. The language is great, and the plot is (mostly) exciting. Think Harry Potter meets Holden Caulfield w/ a fair bit of decorative arts talk thrown in.Now, disclaimer - I'm literally the ideal target audience for this book. I would go so far as to say (and I'm thinking about writing an essay) that this is a unique experience. Theo grew up in what I think is my childhood apartment building (57th and Sutton, toward the river, not quite on the corner) but could be the one across the street. Theo works in nearly the same kind of antique store (same period, but British) that I do, with a shop in the basement where he does some light woodwork and a front of house where he spends the majority of his time on customer interaction. He is exactly my age. He has the same kind of dog as me. He is aware of the same Buggins furniture scandal that I am. It's weird - all the non-dramatic elements of the book hit me like a freight-train, but I have no idea if that will be a transferable experience.But regardless, this is my de-facto Christmas present for readers this year. Incredible characters (Boris is a knockout), high stakes, some great sequences, and passages of genuine beauty. The opening action sequence is memorable. It will be a KILLER movie. It's romantic as hell when it wants to be, and pleasantly cruel to its characters. There is one twist that is jarring and outstanding and well set-up.So why 4 stars and not 5? Well: 1) I tend not to like books whose climax occurs far afield from the rest of the action, and the Amsterdam segment reads like something out of a more mediocre example of this genre. 2) The plot doesn't REALLY make sense, and it knows it, and Theo's constant rationalization can only go so far 3) it is one of those books that, save for the aforementioned twist, relies a bit too much on coincidence for its heavy lifting 4) It never 100% recovers from the eight year time jump (young Theo is more likable, and is sadly transformed.) 5) There is, at the end, no reason for it to have started with those two pages in Amsterdam before jumping back. It is chronological the rest of the way, and I didn't really like knowing where I was going. There was only one reason he would have been there, and so you spend the book waiting for an expected thing to happen once the time jump happens. It's excellent, don't get me wrong, but it's a 4.3 or so because of these issues.And I'm gonna come out and say it: the antique stuff is immaculately researched but sensationalized to the point that it's not really quite how it works. But that's definitely just a problem for me."
177,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32710668-emma,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.75/5 StarsFull review hereWow, I finally finished this book! This novel demands a lot from its readers, it’s not an easy read, it deals with a variety of themes, and it requires a devoted attention to the story. After the terrible events, in which his mother tragically dies, Theo’s life gets turned upside-down. The story then takes off from there and follows Theo throughout some of his teenage years and some of his adult life. In my opinion, there are three main narratives which take form on the first day in which we meet Theo. -The first one is obviously the one regarding his mother, and then later all that concerns his family. Theo’s mother is always present on the page, it’s always there in the back of his head, leading him to behave in a certain way and do certain things. Losing her is a very pivotal point in the story, even though it happens at the very beginning of the book. She was the only person Theo had in its life and without her he is lost.  ...still when I lost her, I lost sight of any landmark that might have led me someplace happier, to some more populated or congenial life... -I would say the second narrative revolves around the ring Welty gives Theo. It’s a very important object that sends the main character in search of something he doesn’t even realize he needs: a real home. Thanks to the ring he gets the chance to meet Hobie, and the rest is history. -The third and final narrative is about the object to which Theo aspires to for the entirety of the novel: The Goldfinch. It’s the painting that puts a lot of the book into motion, the focal point of this entire book. It is also the source of eternal admiration and reverence on Theo’s part. I think the paragraphs detailing the way he thought about this object were some of the most beautifully written. I’m going to end this review by quoting a sentence, about the beloved painting, that I think in some way sums up this novel very nicely. Only-if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn’t it? "

Of course they come in handy for judging a book quickly and I do read them for unknown authors or authors that are hit or miss. After reading a book and looking at the blurb I have often thought ""That's a bit spoilery. I could have done not knowing about that."" Why do blurbs have to contain spoilers of the first 100 pages of plot?Anyway my point is with ""The Goldfinch"" I made a concerted effort to avoid blurbs or any description of any kind before reading it. And looking back at the blurb now I have to say:DON'T READ THE BLURB!I would have been so disappointed with that knowledge. Sure sometimes I get pissed off with books with no blurb and just quotes from Bill Bryson and Stephen Hawking. But this is me this time, and this is my gushing thumbs up, and that means more than Bill Bryson's. And therefore this review is just going to amount to a huge gush of adoration with no plot details at all.Of course I can tell you all what I loved about this book apart from plot details. And the plot was great. Lots of surprises, lots of intrigue. The characters are all wonderful, both to love and to hate. The writing is just so fucking brilliant. 800 or so pages in just under 3 days. That is how good.I also loved Donna's ""The Secret History"" for a lot of the same reasons. She has definitely become one of my favorite authors, and it is good to know that she is popular. A rare overlap between what the masses love and what I love.I don't know if this is an adequate review. But I loved it. And you should read it."
179,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37640114-emma-scott,Rating 5 out of 5," Her death the dividing mark: Before and After.--Donna Tartt, The GoldfinchThere really is no good way to do justice to this book unless I write a review that's a mile long and include a mini-autobiography of my life this past year in the vain hope of trying to explain how I felt this damn book in the marrow of my bones. But that's too much. Told in first-person, it read like a memoir, which was good for me in that fiction has been giving me a hard time lately. I need real stories about real people and real human experience. Why or how I landed on this book, I don't know. I was in the bookstore and it was in my hand, and I set it back on the shelf and walked away in a moment of anti-fiction hesitation. But something drew me back and thank god it did. It was exactly what I needed to remind me how important beautiful writing is; how it's gasoline for the engine of my own writing, but also how a great story is fuel for the soul. These were things I lost and am slowly regaining. I don't do plot recaps; I like to focus on the mechanics, the blood and guts, and the world-building. And let me tell you, folks, this book didn't win the Pulitzer Prize by accident. I hate the word ""rapturous"" as it sounds kind of pretentious, but this book's prose was exactly that. I was rapt. At one point, during one of my many late-night reading binges, I actually pulled my head out of the book and realized that the world I'd been living in was actually a bunch of black typewritten symbols on white paper, I was that submerged. I came up, blinking stupidly, amazed at the power of the storytelling here. Theo Decker, our protagonist, is a complete human being moving in a brilliantly drawn world populated with amazing characters. The Goldfinch has been compared to Charles Dickens in scope and style, but I often felt like some characters, particularly the Barbours, were straight out of Fitzgerald, while Boris--OMG Boris, how do I love thee? In alll the ways--was larger than life but also heartbreakingly real. 
...she was there and she wasn't. Part of her was there, but it was invisible. The invisible part was the important part. This was something I never understood before. 
This is a book about grief, in all its various shades and facets. The grief for the life you once had and the one you were going to have, now gone. Grief from unrequited love. For the deepest of friendships separated by time and distance. Grief of betrayal. Grief of a son for his mother. Grief of a mother for her child. As someone who falls into that last category, I know what she means when she says the invisible is the most important part. That's a truth. And I knew when I read that sentence, I had that feeling that you get when you start to fall into a book and know you're not going to want to come out again. Another, overarching message of this book--wrapped as it is in a page-turning, compelling, engaging story--is almost precisely my entire philosophy on art, life, and death. That art is the proof that we are more than biology, and that how a piece of it touches us--or is created by us so that it touches others--is the proof (and hope) of something more beyond the years given to us. 
 Nature (meaning Death) always wins but that doesn't mean we have to bow and grovel to it. That maybe even if we're not always so glad to be here, it's our task to immerse ourselves anyway; wade straight through it...while keeping our eyes and hearts open.
 Since all things in my life are now viewed through the prism of Izzy's death, I can say that this is also 100% my philosophy. That we have to take it, whatever life gives us; take it and make something of it. Something beautiful, if we can. Something with grace and dignity, so that when we're done we can say we tried our best and those we lost did not leave in vain.“If a painting really works down in your heart and changes the way you see, and think, and feel, you don’t think, ‘oh I love this picture because it’s universal.’ That’s not the reason anyone loves a piece of art. It’s a secret whisper from an alleyway.  Psst. You. Hey, kid. Yes, you.... . it will never strike anybody the same way and the great majority of people it’ll never strike in any deep way at all. A really great painting is fluid enough to work its way into the mind and heart through all kinds of different angles and ways that are unique and very particular. Yours, yours. I was painted for you.”  Just as the upcoming movie can't possibly cram all this book is into two hours, I still can't describe fully what it meant to me, but when I arrived at the end of the journey-with tears streaming down my face--I came upon the words quoted above and thought ""There's your review. Just copy these words and call it a day.""Because it's exactly how I feel about this masterpiece. I know not everyone will hear what I hear in the prose, or see what I see in the story, but that's the beauty of all art. Sometimes a book or poem or painting or piece of music just speaks right to you and this one...Mine, mine, it was written for me. A Prayer for Owen Meany sits atop the highest, most untouchable bookshelf in my life as my all-time favorite book. I never thought another book would come along to unseat it. Given all that has come to pass in my own life, Owen Meany has actually taken on a whole new dimension of meaning and love for me, but I think it now has to share space with The Goldfinch. Not unseated, but sitting as an equal. One from the Before. One from the After. Thank you to the author for restoring to me one piece of something I had lost in my own grief. I will be forever grateful."

Σήμερα ολοκλήρωσα το τρίτο και τελευταίο έργο τηςΜέσα σε αυτό το χρονικό διάστημα και σε αυτά τα 3 βιβλία, κάλυψα 2.608 σελίδες..Απο κει και πέρα το θέμα donna tartt μπορω να πω ότι με πονάει. Ξεκινώντας με τη μυστική ιστορία, να ξαναπώ ότι ενθουσιαστηκα όσο δεν είχα ενθουσιαστεί εδώ και πολύ καιρό με βιβλίο. Συνεχίζοντας με τον μικρό φίλο, έπεσα απότομα από τα σύννεφα, δε μου άρεσε πάρα ελάχιστα και είχα μπερδευτεί με το τι θέλει να δείξει και να εκφράσει μέσα από το έργο της η συγγραφέας. Θεωρούσα ότι με την καρδερίνα θα πάρω την τελική απάντηση μου. Συνέβη κάτι τέτοιο τελικά? Μάλλον όχι. Ακόμη δε μπορω να πω με σιγουριά αν η Tartt ""ήταν"" η μυστική ιστορία ή τα 2 αλλά έργα της. Πάντως η καρδερίνα μου θύμισε περισσότερο τον μικρό φίλο. Ξεκίνησε πολύ δυναμικά με ένα στόρι που με ενθουσίασε και στη συνέχεια, πάλι όλο αυτό ξεφουσκώνει, χάθηκε μέσα σε άσκοπα γεγονότα και άπειρες φλυαριες σε ατελείωτες σελίδες. Ακόμη ένα στοιχείο που δε μου άρεσε ήταν ο κεντρικός χαρακτήρας, ο Θιο. Δε με συγκίνησε παρόλο που πέρασε τα πάνδεινα. Τον βρήκα, αδιάφορο, κυνικό και σε σημεία εκνευριστικό. Δηλαδή, από τη μια να κάνεις όλο αυτό τον ατελειωτο εσωτερικό μονόλογο που να καλύπτει εκατοντάδες σελίδες αλλά όταν έρχεται η ώρα να μιλήσεις σε άνθρωπο το λεξιλόγιο σου περιορίζεται σε ""εεεεε εγώωωω να αααα εεεεε δε νομιζωωωω τιιιιι"", άστο Θιο... Επισης πολλά κεντρικά στοιχεία της ιστορίας δε μου έβγαζαν νόημα... Πως ο Θιο δέθηκε τόσο με τον Χόμπι και την Πιππα?από πού κι ως πού? Το όλο θέμα με τον πίνακα? Ο Μπορις του είχε κάνει τόσα και αυτός απλά δε τα σχολιάζει καν? Δυστυχώς λίγα ήταν τα σημεία που με κράτησαν στην όλη ιστορία.. Για να μην είμαι απόλυτη και αυστηρή, η γραφή της ταρτ για μένα είναι μοναδική, ακόμη και σε σημεία αδύνατα για την πλοκή, η γραφή της ξεχωρίζει και σε τραβάει. Επίσης οι τελευταίες σελίδες του βιβλίου που όλα(?) μπαίνουν στη θέση τους κι επιτέλους ο Θιο αρχίζει να ανοίγει τις σκέψεις του και να φιλοσοφει κατά κάποιον τρόπο, ήταν απολαυστικές. Όμως δυστυχώς όλα αυτά δεν ήταν αρκετά για μένα τουλάχιστον για να μπορέσω να κρατήσω μια απόλυτα θετική γενική άποψη για την Ταρτ.. Παρόλο που οι ιδέες της και η φαντασία της είναι ξεχωριστές, όλο αυτό το ""απλωμα"" σε χιλιααααααδες σελίδες μου άφησε μια αρνητική γεύση και σαν να προσπαθούσε να δείξει κάτι που κατά τη γνώμη μου δεν είναι. “That life – whatever else it is – is short. That fate is cruel but maybe not random. That Nature (meaning Death) always wins but that doesn’t mean we have to bow and grovel to it. That maybe even if we’re not always so glad to be here, it’s our task to immerse ourselves anyway: wade straight through it, right through the cesspool, while keeping eyes and hearts open. And in the midst of our dying, as we rise from the organic and sink back ignominiously into the organic, it is a glory and a privilege to love what Death doesn’t touch.”"

Theo Decker, the protagonist of the book was making some bad choices in his life and it was entirely possible, depending on how the author saw this life given to us, whether ultimately good or ultimately bad, that I could end up getting hurt. Because I liked Theo, despite his bonehead moves. He and I had a lot in common. We both lost a parent around the same young age and in the description of that loss and the loneliness that followed I found for the first time words that described my own loss fifty or so years ago. Isn't that mark of good literature that it gives you words for what you only felt or intuited before?. So I stopped. What did I know about Donna Tartt? This was my first book of hers. Do I trust her to not unnecessarily hurt me, play with me, ask me to love a character only to destroy him? No, I wasn't asking for a happy ending, only I didn't want to encounter hopelessness, a view of life so dark that no redeeming is available. What made me decide to continue reading was the way the author cared for beautiful things. There is Theo's spiritual connection to The Goldfinch, the painting b Carel Fabriius, but also the beautiful and detailed description of the antique furniture that Theo learns to love. Someone with obvious tenderness for broken things, who sees value in protecting that which will out last us, must ultimately come out on the side of goodness. Not that the book doesn't skirt around the edges of evil and lets you peer down some terrifying and much too recognizable precipices. In the description of The Goldfinch, the author talks about the mixture of old established brush techniques that Fbritius utilizes along with some more modern techniques that anticipate modern abstract painting. This book is written with the same mixture of established narrative techniques that create suspense (For some reason Wilkie Collins comes to mind) but also this incredible portrayal, painful at times, of living in the narrator's mind at different stages of his life through various states of consciousness including a very realistic portrayal of post traumatic stress, the hungers of addiction and the utter despair of withdrawal. But there is also a glimpse of the joy found at times by those who held themselves not worthy, had given up. I am glad I kept on reading."

After living through a catastrophic event at The Met in NYC, reminiscent of 9/11, Theo, survives but also suffers great loss, so we, the reader, live through the ensuing events with him as he whirls through the events which follow as well as his traumatic reaction; his numbness, his pain, his inability to turn off the obsessive internal dialogue and questioning about life, existence, destiny, and chance. The only way Theo can escape these ruminations is through the obliterating fog of drugs and we live with him through the use of these as well. We also get to know and love him, rooting for him at every turn. We also get to know several terrific characters particularly Boris, Hobie, Pippa, brought fully to life by Donna Tartt.  Sometimes the descriptions of Theo's emotional and physical experiences can feel a bit over-written, but these passages are in keeping with the over-wrought nature of Theo's existence which is that of PTSD (Note: at one point in the book Theo discusses trying various anti-depressants none of which work and he is told that he in the 20% of depressive patients whom are resistant to anti-depressants. Theo is not, in fact suffering from Depression, or, that is not his primary diagnosis. PTSD is and PTSD he is notoriously resistant to anti-depressants, requiring completely different treatment). I fell l in love with art again and was reminded of why I love art, in all it's forms, in the first place. I am not an expert on Dickens (like some of my GR friends - Teresa and Elaine to name just two) and haven't read him since high school and college. Still, I felt like I was reading a modern version of a Dickens novel moved from London to NYC, Las Vegas and briefly Amsterdam. But this is a NYC novel. Tartt masterfully captures the essence of this city and the people who live there, particularly those of the Upper East Side vs. those who live below 14th Street. Given that I no longer live in NYC and have great nostalgia for the 20 years I spent there, I loved her references to some of my own favorite downtown haunts, like The White Horse Tavern. Tartt also does a good job bringing to life the vapidity of Las Vegas and it's inhabitants. A terrific novel with a huge scope that Tartt handles beautifully.Update: Just as powerful and engaging on the second ""read"" though this time I listened to it on audio. In some ways the story felt more powerful in audio, hearing Theo's voice as I followed him through the whirlwind of life. I picked up on some things that I'd missed or perhaps glossed over on first reading the book 6 years ago and some things, like Theo's relationships to Hobie and others came to life in a way that I did not recall. A secondary character whom I didn't remember but loved on this reading was Theo's doorman who couldn't do enough for Theo and who was devoted to him due to his appreciation of Theo's mother's. A real NYC character. I was yet again saddened by the losses that constantly befell Theo and rooted for him to get out of his constantly passive role in these events (which he eventually does). I was more moved by the ending than I had been on the first read; by his coming to terms with loss and with his life to date. These final pages were so beautifully written by Tartt that I had to rewind and listen to some of the final passages again. Still an all time favorite 5 star book that I will not forget for a long time."

I’m not sure what to make of the story, but the writing of The Goldfinch is of an exceptional category. The characters are the most multidimensional I have ever seen, more than some of the real people I have around me. It’s a strange feeling.There is something sublime in Donna Tartt’s writing that makes it hard to look away. I must have spent 6-7 hours a day reading theses 881 pages (thank you lockdown). I was exhausted, all my emotions were drained but I just could not stop. As with The Secret History, I believe it does not get its strongest intensity on the first read. It is simply too much. It almost feels like an obligation to endure, in a strange punitive way. Once you are done, its magnetism loses a bit of its grip, and you can dive back in and use your brain a little more the next time. It does 100% deserve its Pulitzer Price in my opinion. But is it enjoyable? It’s rambly, it’s sad, and reflective. It’s exhausting and leaves a lot to unpack. Also, after such a ride, you expect an adequate ending. Donna Tartt’s endings always fall in a grey area for me. They lack either a sense of hope, or absolute despair."

Only—if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn’t it? And isn’t the whole point of things—beautiful things—that they connect you to some larger beauty? — Donna Tartt, The Goldfinch..I did it! I finally read Donna Tartt’s 784-page, Pulitzer-winning novel, “The Goldfinch!!” It feels so dam good to finally read & finish it, it’s been sitting on my TBR shelf for too dam long. What an epic, incredible reading experience! I can understand why so many readers are conflicted about the novel, and it is definitely very, very long. But a lofty novel like this is inevitably going to receive much attention & mixed reviews. As for me, I throughly enjoyed & loved it. I was worried about the length of the novel, but I was spellbound from start to finish, despite lot of the dark undertones. epic, brilliant, and dramatic coming-of-age literary novel about a young New Yorker Theo who loses a mother to a terrorist bombing at a museum, and his descend into world of the crime, drug, and underworld of art & wealth..I am one of the last person to have read it and so much has already been said about the novel, so I won’t go in details about the plot, but just share few thoughts on it. There’s just so much to this novel, so much depth, so much to think about it, I can’t possibly cover everything. Although it was very long, I'm not sure if I'd prefer it any shorter because it gave me time to invest in the characters & story..I’m not an artist, visually artistic, nor have any in-depth knowledge of the art world, but I’ve always been fascinated by it. Museums are one of my favorite places to visit in Seattle, and whenever I’m traveling to a new place. I just love looking at art pieces & checking out exhibits. I don’t know how accurate Tartt’s depiction of art & art world are in the novel, but from my understanding and reading other reviews, it seems like she’s done her research and is knowledgeable about it. Plus, it took her over a decade to write this novel! The journey Tartt take readers as Theo is reflecting back on his life was well captured, and it made me wonder whether Theo did best he could given his circumstances. I find the work Theo & his business partner in antique restoration really fascinating..Ultimately, what really blew me away was Tartt’s writing — every word, every sentence were chosen & written with a purpose, it’s not an easy task to capture reader’s attention with a lengthy novel, let alone with a 300-400 page novels. Tartt is undoubtably a masterful storyteller, and I understand why this novel won the coveted Pulitzer Prize. The atmosphere, setting, characters, and the story were well developed, and the writing is just so beautiful. There’s also a philosophical aspect to the novel, and I think that’s where the conflicting views of the novel comes in. This novel made really think, think about art, beauty, and nature that surround us, and the connection that we make with it, which can have profound, lasting effects on us. I thought this was an exceptional novel, an epic story written with literary skills. Dark, philosophical, and profound exploration of art, love, and loss, what a ride! I’ll be honest, I went in with not much expectation, almost as just wanting to get it over with it and didn’t think I was going to love it as much as I did, but this is definitely one of my favorites now. I highly recommend it, but go in with a open-mind. 🤓✌️📖"

And like many others I found The Little Friend a bit of a disappointment (one Faulkner in a lifetime is quite enough thank you) so I greeted arrival this book with a certain nervousness. I'm about a third of the way through it at the moment and am pretty confident in saying you're all going to be singing it's praises come October. It's not a return to form so much as she got better. Enjoying the hell out this one. Having finished now I'll add this:I find it hard think of many books published in the last few decades of the length of The Goldfinch that wouldn't have been better at a third or even half less. Every one of the 771 pages, every word for that matter, of Donna Tartt’s new novel feels necessary.The enjoyable part of my working day is spent talking to people about what books they might want to be purchasing. I long ago got into the, possibly bad, habit of ‘if you like this book you’ll like…’ or ‘this reminded me a lot of…’ short hand to do this. So at the risk doing Ms Tartt a disservice I'm going to proceed along those lines to tell you about this book. Which I hasten to add won’t involve any spoilers.There are nods to her good friend Brett Easton Ellis, though I think those passages only serve to point up how much better a writer she is than he. There is a Dickensian range to the characters (a bit of James and Wharton in there as well) but saving them the kind of caricaturing you get in Dickens is her ability have them at once captives of their class and situation and yet at the same time larger and more importantly, self-aware. This brings Proust to mind and funnily enough he gets referenced near the end albeit in a slightly different regard. She also has the ability, and this what I remember liking about The Secret History, of making all literary allusion and theatrical licence she indulges in not only necessary for the story but also somehow the believable natural condition of her characters. The Goldfinch builds to an epiphany (a crescendo of epiphanies in fact) and I can’t help but be thinking of James Joyce’s The Dead now. Joyce achieves his in a short story and Donna Tartt takes a very long novel to do the same. This is no way a criticism, as I've said I enjoyed every word, and the end is a conformation of how art can transform and expand lives.  "
190,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne,Rating 4 out of 5,"Award-winning American author, Donna Tartt begins her third novel with her twenty-seven-year-old protagonist, Theo Decker, in December, hiding out in an Amsterdam hotel room, reflecting on his life, while scanning newspapers for any available information about a recent murder. Over the next seven hundred plus pages, these in-depth reflections form a meticulously detailed account of the Theo’s life, beginning with the circumstances, when he was just thirteen, of his mother’s death, an event of which he says: “Things would have turned out better if she had lived.” It was then that he acquired the eponymous Goldfinch, the single remaining painting by 17th century Dutch Master, Carel Fabritius. The ride that Tartt takes the reader on starts with Theo a virtual orphan in pseudo-foster care, then in the care of his negligent father, consuming copious quantities of drugs and alcohol. When fifteen-year-old Theo looks in the mirror, he notes his resemblance to his (safe-to-say) despised father, Larry, and when Larry’s girlfriend Xandra flings at him “You and your dad are a whole lot more alike than you might think. You’re his kid, through and through”, his denial is vehement. It becomes apparent from his later behaviour (drugs, alcohol, betrayal of good friends, criminal dishonesty) that she was indeed perceptive.Readers familiar with Australian author Steve Toltz’s epic debut novel, A Fraction of the Whole (2008) may notice similarities, both in the length (somewhat daunting), the careless parenting, the roller-coaster life, and the black humour (in lesser quantity), although Tartt’s work is much less far-fetched. She certainly achieves a vivid portrayal of a thirteen-year-old boy’s grief at the loss of his mother.Tartt has a talent for character description: “I found myself blinking up in the late afternoon glare at a very tall, very very tanned, very thin man, of indeterminate age. He looked partly like a rodeo guy and partly like a fucked-up lounge entertainer. His gold-rimmed aviators were tinted purple at the top; he was wearing a white sports jacket over a red cowboy shirt with pearl snaps and black jeans, but the main thing I noticed was his hair: part toupee, part transplanted or sprayed-on, with a texture like fibreglass insulation and a dark brown color like shoe polish in the tin.” A good literary read that would have benefited from some judicious editing."
191,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10278561-mary,Rating 3 out of 5,"The writing is beautiful. The characters are very ""now."" In many ways, Donna Tartt captured contemporary American city life in a way Tom Wolfe captured it in the 1980s -- with the irony but without Wolfe's gut-busting humor. Young people raising themselves. Self-absorbed adults posing as parents. The prevalence of mental illness and addiction and the relationship of the two. Terrorism. Art theft to fund drug and weapons cartels. It's all in there and then some. And that is really the problem for me. I found The Goldfinch to be a compelling story of a young man at the mercy of the system, an odyssey and a coming of age. I loved its structure and the lovely passages about art and culture, the references to all things raffinés. But then it begins to drag to a painfully drawn out conclusion. It's a nod to Tolstoy, I guess, but who hasn't wished Leo had had a great editor to pare down his superfluity. The whole chapter in Anna Karenina about threshing wheat? It's like that. As a logophile, I truly enjoyed all of the $10 words used for precision of meaning, an art unto itself not found in many current titles. But the ending struck me as self-indulgent on the author's part, in need of a good, thoughtful editor."

To be fair there were moments when I couldn't put it down. Unfortunately, after a certain point I was eager to finish it, which is a sign for me that I am not enjoying the book. It had everything. An explosion, death, theft, drugs, alcohol, black mailing, death, more drugs, more alcohol, black mailing etc etc... Don't get me wrong I know that these things keep the story interesting, but it also makes the story too much.. at least in my eyes.. It's my personal opinion after all.Then there are the characters. So unrealistic and too damaged. The only character I liked was Hobie. Again I don't have a problem with wrecked characters I have a thing with hyberboles. Lastly, the writing. Although, I liked it I also found it tiring. TMI! TMI! To sum up, I kinda enjoyed it and I was also kinda bored. I have read the secret history which I liked more and maybe that's the reason I had high expectations for it. Sadly, the book didn't meet them and I ended up feeling conflicted."

This is where balance is computed and engineered, the oneness with the wire's thread. The audience though assumes she is attached from above for safety. She does not look as the net is rolled away. It is not so much a surety of what is as a fascination of what is to come?Tarrt hands us a volume when opened, looks like it was shopped off a checkout line at a supermarket, lifted into the cart with a pack of cinnamon gum and a tabloid. The checkout boy says he had to read it for school and supposedly there is a bit of Dicken's sprinkled in. On the rack it might fit nicely with other genre offerings.On opening it at home, some of the groceries put away (An exaggeration,) the sentences read as though polished, smooth, fast, Tarrt taking the time to retool each one according to tonal and metric measure, sibilant sound. Why waste the time? Well, at least she added excruciating suspense, fierce action, fascinating intrigue, the much wanted, revered, pain-in-the-ass inability to put it down when important things need to be done, like putting away newly bought groceries which are melting and happily rotting on the kitchen table as I occasionally peek over the book's cover.It was a fifth of the way through when I began hearing voices. I checked and it was not because I missed taking my medications. There is construction going on next door. This was not the sound of gruff voiced jokes between grunts of effort and pain, the wail of power tools and the appearance out the kitchen window of stacks of red tinged wooden boards. It was more like a murmur. Something ghosted. I thought of taking the book out to the workers and see if they could hear anything. They worked in silence, the fluidity of their teamwork, cutting, leveling, bolting, something rising up from nothing.The murmuring, heard, refused any deciphering yet chanted moments of promise lingered. Supple, patient, enduring, it existed as a welcoming path to wander throughout the book but to speak personally with only later, as the book developed its own self. The worker's are gathering their tools now. Their work completed. It is a deck, plumb and angled so that between the opened wedge of trees the bay and the glistening pristine city are placed so they may be seen.Tartt waited eleven years researching and writing this book. Certainly I could patiently wait through writing I enjoyed immensely. It seemed evident to me that part of these eleven years was spent observing, polishing each sentence according to meter and tone. Strange for a suspense novel fit into a lower case genre, that I cared for each fully developed, rounded character, had to know what was going to happen to them next, cared what happened to them. Yet simmered chanting continued below, striving to move from letters of the alphabet into some deeper meaning reserved for literature.This I believe is the genius of the book, Tarrt's genius. Instead of presenting philosophical exploration of the deepest concerns beneath the flow of poetic brilliance or the prose style of great minds, she dares to plunk it beneath a vibrant suspense tale. Something associated with cheap, with easy. Who does she think she is? How dare she.Yet she did. Think of the courage and daring. How easy it would be to toss it early. How easy it would be to lean into the story and unaware no longer read in that way where we search for metaphorical meaning, hidden treasures, the small details which if one steps back and considers, opens an entire content one never expected. The details in the Goldfinch are stored within the tale of traumatic loss, the need to bury time, a life, to avoid the pain that threatens to destroy it, through the menage of alcohol and the myriad phantoms of drugs. Loving only what we know we can never have, we must ask are we simply a set of illusions we have conveniently connected? Is it worth having hope in the face of loss, its continous breath hovering?There is a bird present. A Goldfinch of all things. Its picture is placed on the cover and on an inside page. It is on the ledge of a small cabinet attached to a wall-in a dining room?- Living room? Metal-steel bars are wrapped around the front of the cabinet. Look closely. A chain attaches at one end to the upper bar and at the other end to the foot of the bird. A chosen metaphor but a preposterously obvious one. Don't insult me before I even open the book. But wait. Look closer. The Goldfinch has a stalwart, sober, spartan look, resolutely accepting of its life of deprivation. The look of the eyes, the bird's posture, its shadow, speaks to that it has tried to fly but denied. It is aware of its situation. There is no sign of whining and complaining as I would do. So what. Well, the chain is positioned where possibly the Goldfinch cannot see it or that it is attached to its foot. More so, there are two figures absent from the painting. Who did this to the Goldfinch? Why? What kind of person would take gratification in doing such a thing? They aren't there. Neither are we the viewer. We are not there within the painting viewing the bird. Yet we are viewing the bird, from outside of the painting, from a different dimension, a differing distance. Wait. If we move up real close to the actual painting, trying to squeeze into it, we see only brush strokes, blotches and textures of paint and color. The bird, its wooden perch isn't there; only strokes and points of paint. Where did it go? What happened. Back where we were standing, outside of the painting and from that distance, there existed a Goldfinch, its wooden perch and chain, an entity, a whole. But how? It is only an illusion created by our minds? Is this, could this be true of all things, our vision of our self included? Are we the master of constructs that allow us to make a comforting sense, having been placed in a world that has none? That we agree in varying extents sufficient to survive? Can we see the chain clamped to our foot. Is it all just dabs of paint, details of color and shade, waves of textured brushstrokes? Past the cover pours revelations that are jarring and penetrating.They are further enhanced by the use of the lower case genre, as risky as it is. This technique, style, was used in Secret History but to a less successful degree. Tarrt deserves a medal for bravery. She moves herself outside of the literary establishment's creed with an experiment that appears anti-experimental. She writes for writing itself. She might have published five bestsellers in the time she took to craft this fine book that didn't carry the potential for a high volume of sales. Though surprisingly art sometimes wins out. Who knew.It is recommended for those with a sensitive skin, who read with thick lensed glasses, tend to muse, are willing to be astonished where it seems least likely, and willing to be provoked after the book's covers have been closed.We have our star rating system. I hesitate to absent all stars. It can be mistaken as an oversight or a condemnation. A no star rating here would consider, that like Schwartz's, John The Posthumous, though written in a style as different as can be imagined, contains a similarity in that nothing like this has been tried before. Therefore ratings and the language used above in this review, pertain to the books we have read but not to what is new and outside of that realm. These kind of ratings and words do not and cannot yet portray the full workings of either of these works. John The Posthumous is like a bronco busting up its enclosed shed. Tarrt's is so agonizing because it looks so simple so it cannot be otherwise. That is her intent. My intent is to stay within the unspoken GR mutual agreement, as insufficient it may be in many cases, and provide a rating. 5 stars. There you go. Now I have to live with that, feel plebeian and fortressed, mundane. But as an ancient philosopher, surely someone with a mind much greater than mine, once said, It is what it is. "

Σαν χαρακτήρας μου φαινόταν πιο ενδιαφέρον αλλά και πιο ειλικρινής με τον εαυτό του, κάτι που ο Θίο, για μένα τουλάχιστον, δεν ή��αν.Και μέσα σ' όλα αυτά υπάρχει και η Καρδερίνα, με την οποία ο Θίο έχει πάθει μια εμμονή και από τη μια θέλει να την ξεφορτωθεί και από την άλλη να την κρατήσει όλη δική του.Φυσικά υπήρχαν και κάποιες καλές έως ίσως και διασκεδαστικές θα έλεγα στιγμές όπως αυτή που ο Θίο ανέλαβε το μαγαζί του Χόμπι και πουλούσε δήθεν αντίκες σε ανυποψίαστους πλούσιους πελάτες ή οι υπέροχες περιγραφές των πινάκων (έχω και μια ιδιαίτερη αδυναμία στους Ολλανδούς ζωγράφους!).Δυστυχώς όμως ούτε και το τέλος με ικανοποίησε. Για το οποίο δεν ξέρω τι να σκεφτώ είναι η αλήθεια. Ένας μονόλογος του Θίο για το πόσο άθλια είναι η ζωή και το πως δεν υπάρχουν δεύτερες ευκαιρίες και ένα σωρό άλλα απαισιόδοξα πράγματα με τα περισσότερα από τα οποία εγώ διαφωνώ οριζοντίως και καθέτως. Και ούτε μάθαμε τι απέγιναν οι υπόλοιποι χαρακτήρες......και βασικά εδώ που τα λέμε ούτε ο Θίο κατάλαβα τι απέγινε...Αυτοκτόνησε? Δεν μπόρεσα να βγάλω άκρη....Παρ' όλη την γκρίνια μου όμως, όπως είπα και παραπάνω, δεν θεωρώ ότι ήταν κακό βιβλίο. Αν θα το θυμάμαι μετά από καιρό? Δεν νομίζω. Η φλυαρία της Tartt εμφανής από τις πρώτες κιόλας σελίδες, δεν με ενόχλησε....μπορώ να πω πως μου άρεσε κιόλας ο τρόπος γραφής της. Και παρά το μεγάλο του μέγεθος, σαν βιβλίο δεν με κούρασε και το διάβασα σχετικά εύκολα και γρήγορα. Και σίγουρα θα ξαναδιαβάσω στο μέλλον και κάποιο άλλο δικό της...... Είναι σαν ένα αστείο του Φαμπρίτσιους. Στον πυρήνα της δημιουργίας του υπάρχει ένα αστείο. Κι αυτό ακριβώς κάνουν όλοι οι Μεγάλοι Δάσκαλοι. Ο Ρέμπραντ. Ο Βελάσκεθ. Ο Τιτσιάνο της τελευταίας περιόδου. Αστειεύονται. Μας κλείνουν το μάτι. Διασκεδάζουν. Στήνουν περίτεχνα την ψευδαίσθηση, το τέχνασμα, αλλά μόλις πας ένα βήμα πιο κοντά... Τα πάντα καταρρέουν σε μεμονωμένες πινελιές. Αφηρημένες, απόκοσμες."
197,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1716113-mark,Rating 1 out of 5,"For this, a Pulitzer? C'mon! Donna Tartt = slightly better than Dan Brown. Here's her tell. Most of the philosophy (the ""message"" if you will, which is how Tartt earns her ""slightly better,"" I think ...) underlying the tedious, poorly paced plot and flabby prose comes at the end of the book where the wisdom--you know, the ""message""--is (sigh, yes I have to say it this way) told and not shown. If by ""told"" we mean spraying a gusher of half-assed poetic platitudes in the general direction of this reader's numbed mind. The hero could have gotten the girl at the end. No--too fairy tale, too happily ever after. The protagonist could have killed himself (even after correcting his wrong doings, if not before)--too tragic, too pat. Instead our hero dissolves into a burgeoning mist of amoral moralities and fortune cookie sentiments Boy o boy, for this a Pulitzer? I wrote the above blurb immediately after finishing the book. Should I have been more respectful now that I've learned Tartt supposedly spent 10 years writing this? I should I just be confounded and amazed that after 10 years, this is as good as it gets?Just posted this to my Facebook account:Much respect for The New York Review of Books and Francine Prose's review of Donna Tartt's The Goldfinch in it. Some excerpts from the review that resonate with my thoughts after having finished the book:""'Time that couldn’t be called time.' 'A deep, blood-rocking harmony of rightness.' 'An invisible, bedrock rightness.' 'Arcane time zones.' The novel contains many such passages: bombastic, overwritten, marred by baffling turns of phrase, metaphors and similes that falter beneath the strain of trying to convince the reader of a likeness between two entirely unrelated things. Unable to enjoy or appreciate his early-college program, Theo reflects: 'It was as if I’d suffered a chemical change of the spirit: as if the acid balance of my psyche had shifted and leached the life out of me in aspects impossible to repair, or reverse, like a frond of living coral hardened to bone.' On finding the antiques shop to which destiny has brought him, Theo feels 'a strange thrill, as of unseen cards falling into place.' The thrill of unseen cards falling into place sounds less like any known emotion (or thrill) than like a pop version of a Zen koan.""Exactly. It's reminiscent of one of Cormac McCarthy's similes or metaphors. Sounds fancy enough for someone to remark (perhaps breathlessly), ""such good writing!"" But WTF does it convey? What image is painted in the readers' head?It is so delicious when you read a book review that so plainly says what I thought after reading the book: ""I've cited these contrasting passages to explain why I found it difficult to respond when strangers assumed I was “loving” Tartt’s novel as much as they were, and to make clear why my curiosity about Theo’s future was so often diminished by the limitations of his sensibility and by the careless and pedestrian language with which he responds to the world around him.Reading The Goldfinch, I found myself wondering, 'Doesn’t anyone care how something is written anymore?'—a question I would have been less likely to ask were I reading a detective novel. But The Goldfinch is being talked about, and read, as a work of serious literary fiction. It ends with what may be the longest sermon in literature since Father Mapple ascended to the pulpit in Moby-Dick. As if Tartt is hoping to make sure that we understand what all this means, what these hundreds of pages have amounted to, Theo ruminates at some length on the significance of his experience, a foray into metaphysics that suffers from the same murkiness, the same false emotion, the same inexactitude of language and thought that have characterized the novel ...""So the New York Times Book Review section had a glowing review of the book written by Stephen King. And The New York Review of Books had a review that, for me, approaches the truth beyond the bullshit hype. NYT's Book Review section = trade magazine for the literary/publishing power brokers' ongoing incestuous circle jerk. NYRoB = reviews for readers.Many thanks to my Goodreads friend Tom for pointing out Prose's review in NYRoB. "

Because 27 KAGRILLION hours long, but this gif will have to suffice.I went in blind so I had no clue what it was about aside from taking a wild stab that bird art would somehow be involved. #smartI will give credit where credit is due and say that this narrative went unexpected places on its long and rather meandering road. Points for the fuckery that assaulted my earballs and caused my face to do some calisthenics. Theo is at the heart of The Goldfinch and he displays his innermost self to us warts and all as he traverses loss, heartbreak, isolation and a host of ill-advised decisions from teen orphan to adulting with baggage. He takes us along on his journey from New York to Las Vegas back to New York and all the people, both remarkable and less so, he meets along the way.Literally.Theo and his band of misfits need to stumble into an Oprah giveaway show like nobody's business. For psychological help. Oprah should put that on the agenda for the needy and in denial about it set.Theo absolutely is an imperfect character but he just wasn't fascinating to me. Don't get me wrong, I empathize with him. Dude got dealt a bad hand at the life vs. loss table and I would have to be Cruella de Vil not to feel for him. However his tale is choc-a-bloc with verbose monotony that became tedious not to mention repetitive. I realize this is the nature of humanity and maybe that's the point and I missed the deeper more cerebral connection that others made, but my cup of care with Theo rapidly became bone dry.His friend Boris I liked though. Boris is a morally grey hot mess but he owns and even relishes his hotmesserdom. I respect that. Where Theo rationalizes or goes on these long, rambling, almost stream of consciousness existential tangents Boris is all...He made me chuckle which is why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of relegating it to 2 star oblivion. Also, David Pittu did an exceptional job with the voices and there are a multitude of voices. I will look for something else by him.I will hand it to Tartt; she certainly has a way with words. There were just too damn many of them imho but ymmv."

I sympathized with Theo, but I felt no connection to him, and that after spending hundreds of pages together. Tartt can obviously write, but I wonder whether she isn't a closeted short-story writer, rather than a novelist, because that's kind of how 'The Goldfinch' felt, like many vignettes featuring the same characters vaguely strung together. It wasn't that I didn't like it, it was a fine book, but after the tremendous amount of positive press and attention it has received, I was very wary to even read it, almost knowing I would be disappointed, and that has, unfortunately, been the case.The idea of the story being tied together by one small painting really intrigued me, as I'm very interested in art and art history (though actually there wasn't that much of it in the book). I also found the people Theo met (Hobie, Pippa, Boris) to be the real highlights of this book, rather than Theo himself, who, even as an adult, is entirely uncharismatic. We are told relatively late that he and Pippa still suffer from PTSD, although it is obvious, really, that Theo was quite badly damaged by his traumas. I don't know whether Tartt intended for Theo to be so distant to show his trouble in connecting to the world, or whether it is just the way I interpreted his character. In either case, it prevented me from being as drawn in as I was, for example, with Boris' story. For the most part, I felt everything was told with a strange level of detachment wildly at odds with the deeply personal themes.Tartt's style reminds me a little of Joyce Carol Oates in that there is a lot of descriptive, almost stream-of-consciousness style language. I generally find this method a little annoying and sometimes even inaccessible, so it obviously is not a plus in my eyes in relation to THE GOLDFINCH.All in all, I'm not upset that I read it (although it really felt long, where others of similar length have not). I was curious what all the fuss was about, and now at least I know for myself. In terms of elegance of prose, Tartt is very accomplished and if that is the criteria, she certainly is deserving of the Pulitzer.

The book though. We had an interesting relationship. I really liked it—the lead character's journey was very interesting to follow, the writing was beautiful, and despite the length the story never dragged for me. But I also found some things very frustrating, the biggest of them being the absurd level of Easter European stereotypes—every Eastern European is either a criminal, a drunk, or a prostitute (or some combination of these things), Slavic countries are pretty much the land of always winter populated by dickheads and criminals, Russian language thrown in for ""flavor"", sometimes incorrectly, Dostoevsky and vodka all around... *SIGH*But I did really like it overall, and I'm really looking forward to the film adaptation that's coming out later this year. Fingers crossed, they will actually make some changes to Boris because all of this stereotypical ""dressing"" his character has doesn't need to be there—he is interesting enough without it, and his friendship with Theo is something that's worth spending time on.P.S. I ended up raising my rating from 4 to 4.5 stars because as time went by I realized how much I was affected by the story and how much the themes of life after tragedy, personal identity, and human values resonated with me."

Защото само когато встъпиш в тази междинна зона, на пъстрата граница между истината и неистината, става изобщо поносимо да съществуваш и да пишеш това.Важно е онова, което ни учи да разговаряме със себе си; онова, което ни учи да си пеем от отчаяние. Но картината ме научи и на друго — че можем да разговаряме един с друг, прехвърляйки бариерата на времето. И аз чувствам, че има нещо много сериозно, много важно, което трябва да ти кажа, мой несъществуващи читателю, и чувствам, че трябва да ти го кажа така настоятелно, както ако стоях в стаята пред теб. Че животът — каквито и други качества да има — е кратък. Че съдбата е жестока, но може би не е произволна. Че Природата (с което искам да кажа Смъртта) винаги побеждава, но това не означава, че трябва да се преклоним, да коленичим пред нея. Че дори ако невинаги сме щастливи, че сме тук, нашата задача е да се потопим в живота така или иначе; да газим право напред, напряко през тази помийна яма, с отворени очи и открити сърца. И когато умираме, когато се издигаме над материалното и ког��то потъваме отново, позорно, в материалното, за нас е гордост и привилегия да обичаме онова, което смъртта не може да докосне. Защото, макар че забвението и злополучията са преследвали тази картина през вековете — по същия начин я е следвала и любовта. И доколкото тя е безсмъртна (а тя е безсмъртна), аз имам един мъничък, светъл, непроменим дял в това безсмъртие. И аз добавям своята любов към историята на хората, които са обичали красивите неща, които са ги търсили, които са ги спасявали от огъня, издирвали са ги, когато са изчезнели, опитвали са се да ги съхранят и да ги спасят, предавайки ги буквално от ръка на ръка, и сияйната им песен се издига над разрухата на времето и достига до нови и нови поколения любители на красотата."

""Η Καρδερίνα"" είναι ένα από αυτά.Η εξαιρετική, λυρική και όμορφη μες στην απλότητά της γραφή , οι ολοκληρωμένοι, αληθοφανείς αλλά και ταυτόχρονα αρχετυπικοί χαρακτήρες και η πρωτότυπη πλοκή σε συνδυασμό με τη μυστηριακή, μελαγχολική ατμόσφαιρα είναι όλα στοιχεία που με ελκύουν σε ένα βιβλίο και με κάνουν -εν δυνάμει- να το ερωτευτώ.Τι πήγε στραβά λοιπόν σε αυτή την περίπτωση; Γιατί ενώ έκλαψα και πόνεσα παρέα με τον πρωταγωνιστή, Θίο Ντέκερ, δεν κατάφερα να παρασυρθώ στη δίνη της ιστορίας του και να χαθώ στα βάθη της;Νομίζω ότι παρά τις δεκάδες στιγμές αριστουργηματικής γραφής, η Tartt παρασύρεται από την ίδια τη ροή των όμορφων λόγων της και σε κάμποσα σημεία πλατειάζει άσκοπα, βάζοντας φρένο στην κατά τ'άλλα αβίαστη ροή της ιστορίας. Υπήρχαν σκηνές που κατ εμέ δεν πρόσθεσαν τίποτα στην ιστορία παρά μόνο επιπλέον έκταση. Η αργή εξέλιξη των γεγονότων στο μεγαλύτερο μέρος του βιβλίου δεν ενοχλεί -σε ορισμένες στιγμές μάλιστα συμβάλει στο να δημιουργηθεί η αίσθηση ότι προσπαθείς αργά και επώδυνα να βγεις στην επιφάνεια αφότου έχεις πέσει σε πολύ βαθιά νερά, μια αίσθηση ταιριαστή με τις εμπειρίες του Θίο . Αυτό που με ενόχλησε είναι η άσκοπη ή επαναλαμβανόμενη φλυαρία που υπάρχει σε κάποιες -ανούσιες όπως προείπα-σκηνές και η ξαφνική αλλαγή ταχύτητας που έχουμε στο τελευταίο κομμάτι του βιβλίου που μας βγάζει απότομα από τη ράθυμη μελαγχολικότητα και μας βάζει σε ένα κόσμο γκανγκστερικών διαστάσεων και ρυθμών, που εμένα προσωπικά με ξένισε λίγο. Τολμώ να πω ότι οι σκηνές αυτές ήταν οι λιγότερο καλογραμμένες στο βιβλίο, δεν είναι το φόρτε της Tartt (βέβαια οι ""λιγότερο καλογραμμένες"" σκηνές της Tartt απέχουν παρασάγγας από πολλών άλλων συγγραφέων!).Το δεύτερο σημείο με το οποίο αντιμετώπισα κάποιο πρόβλημα είναι ο τρόπος που παρουσιάζεται η χρήση των ναρκωτικών. Ο Θίο κάνει αλόγιστη χρήση τους σε μεγάλο μέρος του βιβλίου και παρότι η συγγραφέας προσπαθεί να μας μεταδώσει την εμπειρία του, νιώθω ότι το τελικό αποτέλεσμα είναι μια εξωραϊσμένη και ανάλαφρη εκδοχή της πραγματικότητας. Ίσως στο βωμό της ατμοσφαιρικότητας και της προσπάθειας της να κρατήσει μια πιο ""ιντελεκτουελ"" εκδοχή της ζωής του Θίο, η συγγραφέας να διάλεξε να φιλτράρει την εμπειρία του με τη χρήση. Αν αυτός ήταν ο σκοπός της σίγουρα τον πέτυχε, δεν παύει όμως να είναι φύσει προβληματικό.Πέρα από τα δυο αυτά σημεία όμως, ""η Καρδερίνα"" είναι γεμάτη με μικρούς θησαυρούς. Η γλώσσα και η ατμόσφαιρα που ανέφερα είναι μόνο ένα μικρό κομμάτι αυτών. Εκεί που διέπρεψε η Tartt είναι η ψυχολογική διείσδυση στους χαρακτήρες της και δη στου πρωταγωνιστή της. Χωρίς να μας αποκαλύπτει τα πάντα για αυτόν αμέσως (κάτι πολύ δύσκολο δεδομένου ότι παρακολουθούμε όλη την ιστορία μέσα από τα μάτια του) καταφέρνει να μας γνωρίσει τον κόσμο του -εσωτερικό και εξωτερικό- και να μας κάνει κομμάτι του.Απόλαυσα ιδιαιτέρως την ""ανατροπή"" στην οπτική που μας έφερε με τη δεύτερη εμφάνιση του Μπόρις στην ενήλικη πλέον ζωή του Θίο, οπότε και μας αποκαλύπτεται ότι πολλά από όσα νομίζαμε ότι ξέραμε για αυτόν ήταν διαστρεβλωμένα, όπως διαστρεβλωμένη ήταν και η δική του εκδοχή της πραγματικότητας. Το άλλο δυνατό σημείο της Tartt είναι οι γνώσεις και η αγάπη της για τη τέχνη. Το μυθιστόρημα αυτό είναι μια ελεγεία στην αναγκαιότητα, τη ζωτική σημασία της τέχνης στη ζωή του ανθρώπου, είναι μια μελέτη για το τι μας προσφέρει η τέχνη και τι απαιτεί από μας. Δεν νομίζω ότι έχω διαβάσει άλλο βιβλίο που να με κάνει να ερωτευτώ με την ίδια τη τέχνη ως έννοια και όχι με κάποιο συγκεκριμένο κλάδο της. Συνοψίζοντας θα έλεγα πως ""η Καρδερίνα"" είναι ένα βιβλίο που πραγματικά αξίζει όλους τους επαίνους που έχει λάβει αλλά δεν παύει να είναι ένα έργο τέχνης με ψεγάδια. Για άλλους αυτά τα ψεγάδια το κάνουν ακόμα πιο αριστουργηματικό και για άλλους μειώνουν την ένταση της απόλαυσης. Σε κ��θε περίπτωση όμως αξίζει να έρθετε σε επαφή μαζί του και να δείτε σε ποια κατηγορία ανήκετε. Μόνο κερδισμένοι θα βγείτε."

Der Erzählton trifft genau diese Zeit und ich war zunehmend irritiert, wenn ein Protagonist ein Handy aus der Tasche holte oder etwas aus der Neuzeit beitrug, weil ich mich stets in der Aura eines Salinger-Romanes wieder fand. Tatsächlich spielt das Buch aber heute. Theos Mutter war unheimlich sympathisch, intelligent und kultiviert ohne abgehoben zu wirken. Sie war ruhig, introvertiert und wirkte sehr inspirierend auf mich. Donna Tartt traf mit ihren auf den Punkt genauen Beschreibung einen perfekt detailliert gezeichneten Charakter den man sich plastisch vorstellen konnte. Mir wurde zu nehmen und sehr schnell klar dass sie ein außergewöhnliches Talent dafür besitzt mit Worten und Adjektiven umzugehen und die Umgebung zu beschreiben. Es sind nicht einfache Beschreibung die sie macht, sondern sie malt mit ihren Worten umfangreiche Ölgemälde wie die alten Meister.Als Theo seine Mutter bei einem Terroranschlag verlor, bekam die Geschichte für mich einen zunehmend negativen Beigeschmack. Theo steht wie an einer Weggabelung. Durch einen Ring, den er übergeben bekommt, wird er zu einer Person geführt die sein Leben glücklicherweise bereichert. Auf der anderen Seite gibt es aber auch eine Person die ihn in den Sumpf zieht und in genau diesem Zwiespalt befindet sich Theo die ganze Geschichte über. Was für mich an der Stelle nicht zusammenpasst ist Theos Scharfsinn und Selbstreflektion und allem voran seine Intelligenz mit dem Drogenwahn, dem er stetig weiter verfällt. Er selber beschreibt die Auswirkungen von Süchten, die aber auf ihn nie zuzutreffen scheinen. Kein Junkie redet so abwechslungsreich und wortgewandt. Eine Kleinigkeit die mir auch noch bitter aufgestoßen ist, war als eine deutsche Figur ""Horst"" sprach und die Autorin ihm gleich den »nazihaften Unterton« in der Stimme und andere teuflische Eigenschaften unterstellte. Die Bösartigkeit rührte weniger aus seiner Nationalität sondern eher aus dem Business, mit dem er sich beschäftigt und aus seinem Charakter. Das empfinde ich nicht klar differenziert und mittlerweile nervt mich die Nazikeule nur noch; sobald ein deutscher ins Bild tritt. Das hatte die Autorin aufgrund des Anspruchs des Romans gar nicht nötig gehabt und ich empfand das als sehr oberflächlich.Letzt endlich wird die Handlung dominiert von Drogen und sogar actionreichen Mafia Show-downs, die mir so einfach nicht gefallen haben. Es hatte die Ernsthaftigkeit eines Tarantino Films und auch das Ende der Geschichte ließ mich etwas ratlos zurück, weil „das Leben ist eine Jauchegrube“ muss ich nicht in einen 1000 Seiten Roman verpacken...."
212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45632570-tim,Rating 4 out of 5,"The first sixty or so pages of The Goldfinch are quite dazzling in their vitality and virtuosity. It comes as no great surprise that Tartt can’t quite maintain this adrenaline rush as the novel progresses and I have to say at times I felt this novel could do with a good edit. Especially in the repetitive nature of Theo and Boris’ adventures in Los Angeles. There are times when the plot goes into a kind of lay-by and Tartt seems to go back over things we already know. There’s a lot of larger than life exaggeration in this novel – the loveable Boris is a kind of massively magnified Russian cliché but oddly he somehow works and supplies a fresh current of vitality. Theo’s alcoholic gambling father is also a little cartoonish in its excesses but he too somehow works. Hobie, the eccentric furniture restorer who becomes Theo’s guardian, has a too-good-to-be-true aura about him but he too somehow works as a custodian for the regenerating quality of beautiful things. So I’m deducting a star for the over generous withholding of the red marker pen because I can’t help feeling this might have been a brilliant 600 page novel rather than what it is which is an overly self-indulgent 800 page novel. On the whole though an exhilarating literary fantasy, where a painting replaces the ring as the sought after object of magical powers. "

While I found the opening pages so full of promise and excitement, an explosion in an art museum, a boy and his mother are trapped with only the boy making it out alive. He has taken his mothers favorite piece of artwork to save it but gets caught up in what to do next. It seems there are so many directions the author could have taken such a wonderful beginning. Instead, she spends the next 600 pages taking us into a dark world of teenage drugs, depression, you name it...it almost felt as if it had been hijacked by a whole different author. There were so many times I wanted to abandon this hunk of a book, yet I kept on because I had already invested so much time. I kept hoping for another turn, it never arrived. Oh yes, the ending was full of beautifully written language. The meaning of life and death, are we just born a certain way with no chance of change, etc. It felt like the author was trying to impress herself, and I felt it was just B.S. "

Time spent, so that the reader has truly lived with the characters and in their various environs.At the end, when all I realized I'd gasped my agreement, gulped something that meant, it's true, that's right.

The guilty party is Michael Pietsch, the CEO of the Hachette Group publishers, but who keeps his hand in by editing - or in this case failing to edit - a few novels a year by his star authors.There is a good 200 page novel (which is the longest novels should be) lurking somewhere in here but one has to wade through a lot of uninteresting prose to find it. And even within that, having created an interesting and very tangled set-up Tartt gives the book a far too convenient resolution.I'll happily wait 11 years for the next Donna Tartt book, indeed she should feel free to take longer."

218,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-canadian-jen,Rating 4 out of 5,This was one long novel. I did enjoy it - a story about a painting and the impact it had on this child to man's life. Not an uplifting novel - the thread of depression woven deep within it. Self destructive almost. Tartt's writing is disturbingly descriptive but enjoy that style of writing. But was owe soooooo long. The last 100 pages I couldn't get through fast enough. Wasn't fond of the ending either however I did like the character and the character development. Overall would rate it a high 3 (which will tip to a 4 given this scale).

But during reading it… I was falling in and out of the story. It was interesting, but then boring..and it gave me vibes that I liked, but then it became a little gangsta (which I don't like). I didn't like the end. It ended up being a different kind of book, I thought it was something completely different."
220,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5194069-jenbebookish,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. I have to admit I wasn't exactly chomping at the bits to get my hands on this one. The cover didn't really appeal to me, and neither did the blurb telling what it's about… at least not particularly so. And despite the fact that I kept hearing over and over again how great it was, how many people liked it, etc etc…I resisted. Because it won the Pulitzer, I vaguely predicted maybe one day…in the far far future when I didn't have hundreds of books I was dying to read (ya, that'll happen…NEVER!) plus the release date for the paperback got pushed back again because the hardcover kept selling so well and so with the other 300 books sitting on my shelves waiting to be read, The Goldfinch seemed like one of those that would most likely never get read.Didn't I learn my lesson with Middlesex?! Where the exact same thing happened, same hesitation, same lack of excitement, same dismissal of all the word of mouth praise and the Pulitzer Prize?! And then after some strange impulsive decision to pick it up on one random day, I ended up loving it! Which is literally the exact same thing that happened here. I came up on a copy of the book via some good friend who works for the publisher and so there it went onto my to-be-read shelf, and even tho there were about 150 other books that I was much more excited to read, when the time came for another choosing ceremony, on an impulse that can't be explained I reached for The Goldfinch. Some sort of secret book voodoo? Perhaps. (I can't say I'm surprised that there might be some book goddess whispering suggestions in my ear;) ) Because I have to say that this is absolutely the best book I have read in quite some time! What a treat! The last book that impressed me so much was…well, I think I'd have to say Middlesex!I don't even want to go into any sort of details about what the book was about, for fear of spoiling even one second of it. And anyway, nothing I could say would be an accurate summation of what this book holds in it's pages. So all I can say is this: It's a book about a boy, and a painting. And that is all.Honestly, in my opinion, it wasn't even the story that was so wonderful. It was the writing. This being my first experience with Donna Tartt (tho I do have her other books on my shelves-I just haven't gotten around to them yet. ) I didn't really know what to expect. I knew it had won this year's Pulitzer Prize, but I can't exactly say that I wholeheartedly trust the judgement of the Pulitzer panel of jurors. The Road? A Visit from the Good Squad? In my opinion, those are not books I would consider worthy of a Pulitzer. Certainly not books that are worthy of the same prize that was awarded to American Pastoral, The Old Man and the Sea and To Kill a Mockingbird. But this year, I am happy to say that the jurors chose correctly! It is absolutely the best book I've read this year-of course I haven't read every book released this year, but based on my experience with books I would say that one would be hard pressed to find much else that compares, let alone surpasses. And not only this year but any year! Donna Tartt is up there with the best of em!Tho I have to say that while I loved this book, and thought it was absolutely brilliant, and it's the best book I read this year and yadda yadda yadda, it was still just a teeny notch short of an absolute all time favorite. You know, up there with East of Eden and The Fountainhead and Tale of Two Cities and all those other amazing works of art/fiction that swept me off my feet. I loved it, and I thought it was intelligent and first rate and devastating and impressive and a thousand other glorious adjectives, but it did come up a teeny bit short in comparison. And when I ruminated on the possible reasoning for that, the thing I kept coming back to was that it was because it was the writing that dazzled me. It wasn't so much the story, which was totally great (but occasionally slow,) or the characters…(even tho Boris was absolute perfection,) but the writing. Somewhat reminiscent of Rushdie, not because of his style or manner of writing but just in the way that the writing itself is the show stealer. Either of them could be writing about a boring grey stone or a plain white wall, and they would make it sound beautiful. Now that is a gift. And Tartt has that gift! She's a writer, more than a storyteller. If that makes sense. Of course she's both, the story was fascinating and the way it was revealed was an absolute treat…but time after time I kept coming back to the writing. The words, the way they flowed, the way they came together to make sentences beautiful. THAT is what stunned me, THAT is what kept me reading. Because I do have to acknowledge that there were parts of the book that could have been otherwise considered slow, if not for the delightful flow of her words. She is a master wordsmith, queen of diction, ruler of locution. A champion of verbalism, the empress of eloquence! Am I making myself clear?! lol.The book was beautiful. Bottom line. The story was sweet, tho at times difficult to bear for anyone who has a heart, and ultimately it did touch me in more ways than one. Even down to it's physical form; the pages were these certain almost glossy kind of pages that I totally love, so it was for me a tactile experience as well as emotional and mental. Reading The Goldfinch was an experience. That's the best way I can describe it. A wholly arresting and absolutely memorable experience, and one that I highly recommend every reader have. Tartt has successfully won another fan, and I am finding it difficult to take a break before diving right into another of her books! Suffice it to say, I am more than eager to get into A Secret History!Go! Read it. Now! "
221,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84916113-daisy-mae,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is an amazing book. Wait, I know I should add: ""In my opinion"" but hey, I really want to say it just like that. This is simply an amazing book. Last year I read The Secret History and had mixed feelings about it, so when I heard people praising this book I just assumed my feelings for it would be lukewarm to say the least. Well, moral of the story, never judge a book by its author. No, really, I should never assume that just because I don't particularly like a certain book from a certain author I don't like the author per se. And it's not like The Secret History is a bad book or anything, it's just that when you start reading some 800+ pages novel, you kinda want to make sure you are not going to have the worst time of your life beforehand. Oh well, what can I say: all my preconceptions about this book (too long, too pretentious, boring, etc) were absolutely wrong. I added it to my 2020 favourites list before even finishing it. And that only happened one other time this year. There is just something about good, very long books, that attracts me like a magnet. The feeling of being submerged into an alternative world, the fact that the length allows you to grow fond of each character (man do I love Boris) and root for them, actually care for them, see them grow etc. - can only be fully achieved with this kind of long novels. I can't believe how fast I went through this. I just couldn't stop wanting more of this story. I know you guys hate the whole ""this book reminds of __ with __"", but I still like to do comparisons from time to time, just in case someone stumbles upon my review who also loved the other book mentioned and decides to give this one a try because of that. This book reminded me - in a soft, not nearly as trauma-inducing way - of another favourite ""brick"" of mine, A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara. Both catapulted me into stories of sadness, grief, friendship, coming-of-age, trauma, love and loss and, to be honest, I couldn't have enough of both, although I am aware it sounds cruel to put it this way. It's not like I enjoy reading about human suffering - or maybe I do because, in some way, isn't it a cathartic experience to know that we all suffer, we all grieve, we all die in the end? - but at the same time, the more a character goes through in his fictional life, the more I grow fond of it. I loved every single page of this book, and if I have to find only one - small - flaw, it is in the ending (last 100 pages) which, in my opinion, was longer than necessary and I thought that the story could have been wrapped up faster and more effectively in half of the pages. Anyhow, definitely one of the best books I read this year.I should add, on a side note - although it is one of the aspects of the book that had the greatest impact on me from the beginning - that the way grief is explored and treated in this book is one of the best and most realistic ones I ever read. I think this shows a lot on the talent of the writer, since this is definitely not an easy topic to write about. "

Why did this win a Pulitzer Prize? This book was torture to get through.

I loved the start... captivating, surprising and emotionally engaging. But then I found the story stalled and I struggled with how the characters developed. Page after page, waiting for improvement that I never found. Finally finished after 752 pages and did not feel a thing. I know that lots of people rave about this book but I found it tedious.

Schwer traumatisiert und ohne wirklichen Halt und vor allem ohne Gewissheiten im Leben, versucht Theo teilweise unter wirklich schwierigen Umständen erwachsen zu werden. Donna Tartt erzählt diese Geschichte auf über 1000 Seiten und trotz dieser Länge war sie mir nie langweilig. Zu Beginn des Buches war Theo kein Charakter, den ich mochte. Er machte mir den Eindruck eines besonders widerspenstigen und verdruckten pubertierend Jungen, der von seinen Hormonen so durcheinander war, dass er sowieso keinen klaren Gedanken mehr fassen konnte. Mit der Zeit aber kam ich Theo immer näher. Er war zwar immer noch kein für mich besonders liebenswerter Mensch, aber ich begann ihn zu verstehen und vor allem mit ihm zu fühlen, Dazu war es sehr hilfreich, dass die Autorin Theo als Ich-Erzähler angelegt hatte. Dadurch hat man als Leser einen intensiven Blich auf sein verwirrtes Innenleben und seine häufig nicht gerade geradlinigen Gedankengänge. Ich habe Theo zwar immer noch nicht wirklich verstanden, aber ich konnte sehr genau spüren, wie er sich fühlte. Es gibt Stellen im Buch, an denen Theo in die Obhut von Menschen kommt, die ihn wirklich mögen und ich habe Hoffnung geschöpft, dass sich nun alles zum Guten wendet. Ich habe lange darüber nachgedacht, wieso sich Theos Situation längerfristig nicht verbessert. Gut er hat etliche falsche Entscheidungen getroffen. Aber jeder Mensch trifft ab und an eine falsche Entscheidung ohne, dass ein Leben gleich den Bach runter geht. Aber Theo hat diese falschen Entscheidungen derart gehäuft getroffen, dass er sich sehr viel verbaut. Bei näherer Betrachtung habe ich jedoch festgestellt, dass Theo keine falschen Entscheidungen getroffen hat. Genau genommen hat er gar keine Entscheidungen getroffen. Entweder er war innerlich so gelähmt und betäubt, dass er einfach gar nichts gemacht oder entschieden hat, wenn es dringend notwendig gewesen wäre. Oder andere Menschen haben Entscheidungen getroffen und ihn genügend unter Druck gesetzt, um diese Entscheidungen umzusetzen. Das wesentliche Problem hierbei war, das Theo schon als 13-Jähriger und schon vor dem Tod seiner Mutter einen verhängnisvollen Zug zu den falschen Leuten hatte, die ihm nur geschadet haben. Dabei ging es gar nicht darum, dass diese Menschen Theo vorsätzlich schaden wollten, sondern sie haben ihm geschadet durch das, was sie waren. Theo hat also nie Ereignisse ausgelöst, sondern ihm sind immer nur Ereignisse zugestoßen. Er hat sich nie bewußt für Möglichkeiten entschieden, sondern immer nur zufällig verfügbare Möglichkeiten genutzt ohne über deren Sinnhaftigkeit oder Konsequenzen nachzudenken. Und natürlich geht es immer wieder um das namensgebende Gemälde, das Theo schon seit jenem verhängsnivollen Museumsbesuch begleitet. Obwohl ich nicht kunstinteressiert bin, haben mich Donna Tartts Ausführungen zu diesem Bild und zur Kunst und zum Kunsbetrieb im allgemeinen sehr fasziniert. Mir hat dieses Buch sehr gefallen und die Geschichte war für mich über die ganze lange Strecke gleichermaßen interessant. Donna Tartts Schreibstil war wie immer makellos und hat mir sehr viel Genuss bereitet. Dennoch fehlte der letzte entscheidende Kick, um dies zu einem 5-Sterne Buch zu machen. Einen Abzug gab es auch für das schon fast märchenhaft versöhnliche Ende, auch wenn ich dadurch als Leserin das Buch mit einem sehr viel besseren Gefühl zuklappen konnte. Trotzdem: Große Leseempfehlung. Und 4 glänzende Sterne von mir. -----------------------  A long but fulfilling novel  Theo Decker was 13 years old when his mother was killed in a bomb attack in a museum. Heavily traumatized and without any real support and above all without any certainties in life, Theo tries to grow up under really difficult circumstances. Donna Tartt tells this story in over 1000 pages and despite its length I was never bored. At the beginning of the book, Theo wasn't a character I liked. He gave me the impression of a particularly recalcitrant and cranky adolescent boy who was so confused by his hormones that he couldn’t think straight anyway. But over time I got closer and closer to Theo. He was still not a particularly lovable person for me, but I began to understand him and, above all, to feel for him, It was also very helpful that the author had designed Theo as a first-person narrator. This gives the reader an intense look at his confused inner workings and his often not exactly straight lines of thought. I still didn't really understand Theo, but I could feel very clearly how he felt. There are places in the book where Theo comes into the care of people who really like him and I had hope that everything would turn out for the better. I was wondering for a long time why Theo's situation didn't improve in the long term. Well, he made quite a few wrong decisions. But every person makes a wrong decision every now and then without life going down the drain. But Theo made these wrong decisions so often that he was an obstacle for himself. However, on closer inspection, I found that Theo did not make any wrong decisions. In fact, he didn't make any decisions. Either he was so paralyzed and numb inside that he simply did nothing or made a decision when it was urgently necessary. Or other people have made decisions and pressured him enough to implement those decisions. The main problem here was that Theo, as a 13-year-old and even before his mother's death, had a fateful tendency to the wrong people who only harmed him. The point was not that these people intentionally wanted to harm Theo, but that they harmed him by being themselves. So Theo never triggered events, only events always happened to him. He never consciously decided on possibilities, but always used randomly available possibilities without thinking about their meaningfulness or consequences. And of course the story is always about the eponymous painting that Theo has been with since that fateful visit to the museum. Although I am not interested in art, I was very fascinated by Donna Tartt's comments on this painting and on art and the art business in general. I liked this book very much and the story was equally interesting for me over the whole long journey. Donna Tartt's writing style was flawless as expected and has given me a lot of pleasure. Nevertheless, the last decisive kick was missing to make this a 5-star book. There was also a deduction for the almost fairytale conciliatory ending, even if it enabled me, as a reader, to close the book with a much better feeling. Nevertheless: Great reading recommendation. And 4 shiny stars from me. "
228,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18326975-puella-sole,Rating 3 out of 5,"Roman, od skoro 800 strana u prevodu, u svojoj osnovi donosi priču o odrastanju i životu junaka Teodora Dekera, trinaestogodišnjeg dječaka koji se zajedno sa majkom zatekao u muzeju u trenutku kada se u njegovim prostorijama desio bombaški napad. Teodor Deker, za raziliku od svoje majke, taj napad preživljava, ali on ostavlja neizbrisive posljedice na njegovu ličnost. Te posljedice ujedno određuju mnoštvo njegovih kasnijih postupaka i odluka, a samim tim i tok cjelokupnog romana. Prva od tih odluka jeste da iz ruševina muzeja ne izađe praznih ruku, već da, vođen molbom čovjeka koji se zatekao kraj njega u toku napada, i koji je sa sobom vodio riđokosu djevojčicu koja je privukla i zaokupila Dekerovu pažnju, a s kojom ćemo se i na narednim stranama susretatii, uzme i sa sobom ponese jednu neveliku sliku holandskog slikara Karela Fabricijusa, koja je uspjela opčiniti i njegovu majku, koja će uspjeti privuću pažnju mnogih, koja će istovremeno biti simbol nade, sjećanja na ugodnu prošlost i nezaustavljivog posrtanja u propast, i po kojoj je, na kraju kajeva, i sam roman ponio ime – „Češljugar“. Jedna slika, jedna eksplozija, jedan dječak i mnoštvo odluka i susreta koji čitaoca vode na jedan neobičan put od Njujorka, preko Las Vegasa, do Amsterdama ispod svog površinskog nivoa događajnosti kriju autorkinu namjeru da napiše roman posvećen umjetnosti i njenoj suštinskoj ulozi u životu čovjeka.Da sažmem utiske: sve vrijeme čitanja imala sam utisak da mi prosto nešto nedostaje, neki dodatni sloj koji bi dao nešto dublji smisao cijelom romanu. I tako iz strane u stranu. Takav utisak u dobroj mjeri popravio je završetak romana, koji ide u red najdirljivijih krajeva koje sam pročitala. Prvih 750 strana možda i nije ostavilo neki poseban utisak, ali ovih tridesetak posljednjih i te kako jeste.

230,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28266234-7jane,Rating 4 out of 5,"Theodore Decker reflects on his past, starting from the day when he lost his mother, Audrey, in a museum bombing, and became the owner of the painting in the cover, which ends up being like a sticker you can't shake off your hand to drop it away, into whatever place it deserves. From here starts a journey that brings him in the end to Amsterdam on a mission to get this painting back to himself, though what will he do with it afterwards is not yet decided (things will not go as planned, but a good ending is reached).He's clearly messed up from this loss, and the toll it has taken on his health (PTSD, tinnitus, slide into addiction(s)). He gets some relief from his almost-love-interest, Pippa, a fellow sufferer (of whose path I would've liked to read more). His friendship with Boris is crucial in fixing up problems, and bringing in some lightness, into the blurry, detached world of Theo.You may end up thinking of various forking paths that might've happened in each turn - at least I did. Like, of course, what would've happened if his mother hadn't died (maybe at least the eviction that the other occupants of their home building went through some years later, as Theo witnessed the change in their building while walking familiar neighborhood later on), or what would've happened if he hadn't been taken in by the Barbours. But also what would've happened if: his dad, Larry, had not reappeared, he had not met Boris, he had not met Hobie, had he decided to run away to California, had he reconnected with Andy after coming back to New York, had there been no sudden departure to Amsterdam, etc. etc.Also some of the places described were interesting to imagine: the museum, the home of the Barbour's, the shop of Hobart & Blackwell, Las Vegas (and that one Christmas there), Horst's place, the Russian restaurant, and so on.There are some timeskips, mainly the 8-year timeskip before chapter 9, and a shorter one before chapter 10. You do feel the danger Theo gets from Lucius Reeve, though he turns out to be a somewhat small threat, even becoming less so as Theo starts towards the end to travel widely to get back those fake furniture pieces. Theo's view on life, at the end, reminds me a little of the one book in the Bible, Ecclesiastes. That ""all is vanity"", yet at the same accepting that while life is short, it is still good to enjoy what is there, even if one is never going to fit into the usual life patterns of the 'normal' people. Both Theo and Pippa are forever damaged by that one event, yet they go on, sometimes stumbling, sometimes thrilled by joys to the senses they might find. Yeah, this book is about guilt, obsession, loss, yet there is also the joys of art, friendship, travel, and experiences. And so the book ends with some clearly unfinished things (Theo's love life and others), but it ends in a rush of great moods and joy."
231,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am bowing in reverence to Tartt for her talents and her insights. I want to put all my adjectives in capitals and bold letters, but I really don't want to shout, I just want to say emphatically how impressive this book truly is.I felt at times that I was not just following Theo's story but living it with him. Particularly his loss of his mother felt real and at times painful. She was a concrete character for me as well, which is quite unusual for a character who is gone from the action of the story so early on. As Theo goes through the process of surviving, I could not help thinking how disturbing it would be for his mother, who loved him so and did so much to raise him well, to know what he endured and how he coped with her loss...how totally the system failed him.And what a graceful, poignant command of language:""She was between me and whatever place she had stopped from, what landscape beyond. And it was all about the moment when our eyes touched in the glass, surprise and amusement, her beautiful blue eyes with the dark rings around the irises, pale blue eyes with a lot of light in them: Hello! Fondness, intelligence, sadness, humor. There was motion and stillness, stillness and modulation, and all the charge and magic of a great painting. Ten seconds, eternity. It was all a circle back to her. You could grasp it in an instant, you could live in it forever...""This is a lengthy novel, which seemed too short when it was over. I could have stayed in that world for several more days and not complained once. Despite its length, I never had any feeling that Tartt was telling me too much or taking too long to tell it.Beyond the story, beyond the fascinating characters and beyond the lovely use of language, are all the deeper themes being explored. Is there fate? Are we sometimes linked to one another in ways we cannot understand or even avoid? Do objects, like art, sometimes have deeper meanings that transcend time and speak to individuals in ways that are personal and intimate? Why do we sometimes find those who love us among those who have no obligation to do so, while those who should care simply do not? Can good grow out of bad, or vice versa, and to what extent are they intertwined in ways we cannot fathom or control? If the intent of literature is to stir emotions and raise an internal debate, The Goldfinch has achieved that in spades. I closed the book and then sat in silence contemplating its meaning. I will be thinking about it for quite a while, I am sure, and I expect I will revisit it again someday. If our century produces any ""classics"", this must be one of them."
232,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20625013-liz,Rating 4 out of 5,"Lately I've read a lot of 4 and 5 star books and that streak continues with The Goldfinch. I really enjoyed this book and it’s been either in my hands or very close by for the last seven days. The problem is that it left me with so many things to think about that it's tough to distill down to a few paragraphs. Therefore, I've edited. Heavily. And I don't blame you if you skim.Thirteen year old Theo Decker’s feelings of loss and guilt after the death of his mother are palpable and I can’t help but feel an affinity for him that makes me forgive him any and all missteps he takes during his life. Because let’s face it, he does make some blunders. Still, it’s clear that he has a true moral compass, probably shaped and nurtured during the early years he had with a loving mother. His rare moments of buoyancy revolve primarily around Pippa, the young girl who was with him during the traumatic event in which he lost his mother and she lost her brother. Although Theo and Pippa do not physically spend a lot of time together, she is a large presence in his thoughts and it’s with her that his connection to his dead mother and his hopes for the future are closely entwined. Reading this book is tantamount to a drive through Theo’s often wrecked, occasionally sober, but almost always tormented psyche. It’s a profoundly written first-person perspective immersing us in his mood, his sense of impending doom, and also the effect of whatever drug he may be on at the time. There are many powerful and thought-provoking moments in this book, yes. Perhaps too many. At times it was mesmerizing but too there were times I needed a break from the intense scrutiny of life, to just to step back and see the story as a whole. Maybe that’s why this particular statement, regarding the artist’s rendering of the The Goldfinch painting struck me as apropos of Theo’s life. 
“There’s a doubleness. You see the mark, you see the paint for the paint, and also the living bird.”
I like think that Theo comes to the realization as well that he can live his life without looking at the paint. Without looking for the patterns, worrying about fate vs. chance or wondering “what if.” Well, long review. I'd say say if you haven’t read this one, take a chance. It might surprise you. "

The Goldfinch
will probably stay on my mind for a long, long time as the favorite book I've read. It completely got me, and I'm sorry that I've been avoiding it for so many years.My expectations were high and justified.This is a very emotional story about obsessions, family, love, friendship, tragedies, and many other important life things in general. The writer's artistic approach was fantastic, and, as I was reading it, I had a feeling as if I'm reading something that's not set in the 21st century. Something so magical from my point of view. It took 10 years for Donna Tartt to write this beautiful, genius masterpiece that broke my heart a few times. At the very end of the book, I had a feeling that I'm reading something by Dostoevsky - which really impressed me. Theo Decker's thoughts - are so philosophical, provoking, and make you wonder after closing the book."

What we have here is the rarity of a well-written but accessible work. Dickens with a Russian twist. I agree with Stephen King's review http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/boo... with the exception that I warmed to the details of restoration.

God. If I had to pinpoint the moment I became interested in art history, this book is it; I think of it every time I'm in an art museum, closing my eyes, feeling the histories of each and every piece wash over me. I think of the art throughout the years I've seen that burrows into my core, the magic of stumbling across art that changes you, fundamentally. The Goldfinch did that to me. Because I share the same optimistic nihilist philosophy that Theo Decker offers up in the finale of this book: art makes life worth living. Art, music, literature, things that have dug me out when I've convinced myself I have one foot in the grave. The Goldfinch isn't for everyone. It's a long, winding novel, sometimes needlessly pretentious, exceedingly melancholy, with very little of a plot and an unreliable, self-absorbed main character who exhibits a lot of uncomfortable behaviours. But the book is also filled with some of the most masterfully evocative prose I've ever read--Donna Tartt's writing is breathtaking picturesque and brilliant, somehow managing to make the most mundane things seem animated and alive. For a book like this, and for a character like Theo--horrifically traumatized, grief-stricken, secrets like pills--the writing is essential. It's so easy to become immersed in Theo's head while reading The Goldfinch, which isn't a particularly pleasant experience, but Theo is so essentially real, so human. He is, after all, a child for half the book--and the reader sees how these formative experiences shape his life as an adult, how the trauma from his childhood follows him inexorably throughout the years. The characters walking in and out of his life: Boris, Kitsey, Pippa, Hobie, Xandra, are all memorable in their own ways. Boris: a highlight of the book, fearless and careless. Pippa: there on the day of the explosion, whom Theo develops an all-consuming obsession with (something I did, on this read-through, find frustrating). Despite all his faults, melancholy, depression, obsession--Theo remains sympathetic to the reader, and alarmingly easy to relate to, tugging on the strings that connect people together. An interesting point: Theo is one of the most passive characters I've seen in literature, which is endlessly fascinating to me: he's pulled along on the currents of other people's decisions, things tending to happen to him instead of Theo ever making a single decisive choice, or at least that's how it comes off: Theo riding the waves of fate. Of course, it's the one choice he makes in the beginning--taking the painting--that puts him on the path to the cohesive thread running throughout The Goldfinch. Though the book is nearly eight hundred pages long, it goes by quickly, rarely dragging: stringing the reader along on prose and art and philosophy, furniture dealings and drug dealings, the highest of highs and the lowest of lows from New York to Las Vegas to Amsterdam. Grief, ecstasy, depression, joy, being sickened and disillusioned with the world yet finding beauty in the simplest of things, the chime of a laugh, gleam of a table leg, shine of floor tiles, or a painting of a goldfinch on a cream background, chained to his perch. The Goldfinch is a novel brilliant in so many ways, a rare yet essential spark of light in literature.

241,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44824883-paul,Rating 4 out of 5,"Last year, I read Donna Tartt's The Secret History and, while I appreciated how well written it was, it failed to connect with me emotionally, largely because I really didn't like any of the characters. The Goldfinch has been recommended to me by so many people, though, that I was definitely willing to give Tartt another chance. I'm glad I did.The Goldfinch is a classic bildungsroman novel, which is very evocative of Dickens. While not quite up to Dickens' standard (by which I mean no criticism, Dickens being Dickens) I do think Tartt is to be applauded for attempting something of this nature in the modern book market. (I believe she won a couple of prizes or something, so I'm not the only one who thinks so.)Our protagonist, one Theo Decker, lives a life marked by tragedy at an early age and the novel deals with how despair follows him through the years. This is a theme close to my heart and I thought Tartt portrayed it very well. A lot of the events are of a dark nature, including drug abuse and organised crime. It's not all doom and gloom, though, and there are even some moments of humour scattered about here and there.I enjoyed this book a great deal, my only criticism being that I felt it was a tad overlong. A firmer hand at the editorial rudder may have resulted in a better book, perhaps. What do I know, though? I've never won a Pulitzer!"
242,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22207762-stacy,Rating 5 out of 5,"What does a great book do? For me, there are three primary things: (1) It makes me feel everything—whether it be pain, anxiety, happiness, etc.—right along with the characters. (2) It puts me in situations in which I’ll likely never be and creates empathy in me. (3) It surprises me. (Yes, my third point might seem trivial or even a bit odd, but I LOVE being shocked at least once in every book I read.)Tartt did this and so much more in The Goldfinch. The characters she created felt so real, perhaps because of their idiosyncrasies more than anything. Her extensive descriptions immersed me in Theo’s world. And the circumstances she had him face broke my heart. I cringed so many times, thinking Please, no. Don’t let this happen to him. OR Don’t have him make this choice. But I was there alongside him as he made each one. I was walking with him during each stage of his young life. Theo’s reflections at the end of the book, after everything he faced, were so fitting. I didn’t agree with all of them, but I agreed with some. And they were all very poignant.Other random thoughts: *Boris is crazy and often hilarious.*I love Hobie!*I hope the movie is well done. I suspect it will be because of the cast. I can’t wait to see it next year!*Finally, I am not an art aficionado, but I aspire to be one after finishing this book. And I—like many Tartt fans, I presume—hope to see this painting in person someday!"

There were points at which I could not imagine giving it anything other than a 5+ star rating. At the end some of the momentum does slow down a little bit— when things are getting wrapped up— but despite that, I really would recommend this book to any and every reader. The Goldfinch  has a little pinch of almost everything that I truly love in fiction: moral ambiguity, intellectual style (without the heavy-handedness), an unrequited love, a little russification, and an antihero-style character that you can't help but adore. (Boris!) Other reviewers were right— those Vegas years really are golden. I wish I could go back and read a thousand more pages from that epoch.All gushing aside, though, I hesitate to give it the golden 5. Because it is beautiful, funny, well-done and all the rest...but the ending is too much of a sum-up for me. Too much ""spelling it all out"" for my taste, I guess.

Влюбих се в Хоуби с неговото търпение, щедрост и доброта; влюбих се в Тио с неговата крехкост и копнежи; и не на последно място, влюбих се в Борис, особено след преживяванията в Амстердам, с неговата непринуденост, ексцентричност, отдаденост, позитивност, спонтанност и смелост да подкрепи приятел, да бъде негова упора, да следва сърцето си и да прави това, което смята за редно. Несъмнено, Тарт е майстор на словото и омайва с думи. Пише толкова изкусно и натуралистично, че няма начин да не те въвлече в сюжета, който изгражда. Мога да предположа колко титаничен труд е коствало написването на тази книга, но си заслужава цялото усилие, защото носи истинско удоволствие.

Still it's a good read for summer, it makes you remember childhood when you were reading just for the sake of finding out what happens next and the plot was everything what you needed from the book.And besides (I told myself) wasn’t it time to Move Forward, Let Go, turn from the garden that was locked to me? Live In The Present, Focus On The Now instead of grieving for what I could never have?* Was groundless, hopeless, unrequited obsession any way to waste the rest of my life?*maybe good luck was like bad luck in that it took a while to sink in. You didn’t feel anything at first. The feeling came later on.*the world is much stranger than we know or can say. *You didn’t meet many people who moved freely through the world with such a vigorous contempt for it and at the same time such oddball and unthwartable faith in what, in childhood, he had liked to call “the Planet of Earth.”*Only here’s what I really, really want someone to explain to me. What if one happens to be possessed of a heart that can’t be trusted—? What if the heart, for its own unfathomable reasons, leads one willfully and in a cloud of unspeakable radiance away from health, domesticity, civic responsibility and strong social connections and all the blandly-held common virtues and instead straight towards a beautiful flare of ruin, self-immolation, disaster? *It’s not about outward appearances but inward significance. A grandeur in the world, but not of the world, a grandeur that the world doesn’t understand. That first glimpse of pure otherness, in whose presence you bloom out and out and out.A self one does not want. A heart one cannot help.*But what does the painting say about Fabritius himself? Nothing about religious or romantic or familial devotion; nothing about civic awe or career ambition or respect for wealth and power. There’s only a tiny heartbeat and solitude, bright sunny wall and a sense of no escape. Time that doesn’t move, time that couldn’t be called time. And trapped in the heart of light: the little prisoner, unflinching. I think of something I read about Sargent: how, in portraiture, Sargent always looked for the animal in the sitter (a tendency that, once I knew to look for it, I saw everywhere in his work: in the long foxy noses and pointed ears of Sargent’s heiresses, in his rabbit-toothed intellectuals and leonine captains of industry, his plump owl-faced children). And, in this staunch little portrait, it’s hard not to see the human in the finch. Dignified, vulnerable. One prisoner looking at another.*And as terrible as this is, I get it. We can’t choose what we want and don’t want and that’s the hard lonely truth. Sometimes we want what we want even if we know it’s going to kill us. We can’t escape who we are. "
251,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5990485-mary,Rating 4 out of 5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ / 5The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt may have taken me 14.5 hours to read but I would say it was totally worth it!What it's about: After Theo's mom dies in a horrible accident that he survives, Theo bounces around from a friend's house, to his dad's home in Vegas, and back to an unexpected ally named Hobie in New York. The Goldfinch follows Theo's life from just before the accident to when he is an adult and finds himself in a world of trouble. I literally have no idea how Tartt managed to put together such a long and soulful read, but she did, and I mean wow - it is clear she is an incredibly talented writer. The Goldfinch is incredibly descriptive, philosophical, and it really makes you think. I really liked Theo as a character even when he was at his worst and I wanted to smack him across the head. The tragedy he goes through and the action he takes throughout his life shape who he is and makes for an interesting reading experience.I did think the end was drug out a little and it could have been a good 50-100 pages shorter, but overall, I was really impressed with how this 771-page book managed to keep me engaged. It would make a wonderful book club book, and I'm so glad I read it as a buddy/group read. The Goldfinch is also heavy with art and furniture details, and many things I didn't know at all. It was not only a learning experience, but an emotional ride as well. This is a book that is going to stick with me for a long time to come, and I can't wait to see it in movie form. Song/s the book brought to mind: Back to Black by Amy Winehouse & So American by Portugal. The Man.Final Thought: I recommend reading The Goldfinch in some sort of group/buddy read setting so you can discuss with others, and I also highly recommend reading other books in between. I think this is a good one to take your time with and break into sections, so it isn't as overwhelming. Almost 800 pages is no joke, and for a mood reader like me it really helped that this wasn't the only book I was reading for 4 weeks. Heavy, descriptive, and haunting, this book is not for the faint of heart, but if you are looking for a long book with substance this is definitely it! I can't wait to read more by this author and to be further amazed by her skill."

The author manages every event and turn in the characters life with such a mastery that every page turned is another hook into the story; a hook that impedes the reader from leaving the book unfinished. While having initially perceived 800+ pages as rather excessive, as I carried on reading, the number of pages seem to have been measured almost scientifically. I say this based on the successful assimilation of personality and ideas transferred from the characters to the reader. By the end of the book, although Theo’s mental process and personality are stratospherically different from mine, I knew exactly what he felt and thought. The triumph of such effect could be largely attributed to the number of pages the author decided to leave on the final draft; backing up the amount of years this book required to be written (10 years). On the other hand, the plot surrounding the painting, The Goldfinch by Fabritius, a XVII century Dutch painter, is a great amalgam between the personal endeavours of the characters and the intellectual background aimed at by the author. In addition to the painting being clearly a supporting character in the story, the description of the painting and notes on its creation, as well as the historic period in Netherlandish painting history, offer a flavour to the book that is not often found in works with similar features. In short, this novel is a highly deserver of the Pulitzer awarded to it. The author takes us through the psychological process of a man who is not afraid of diving head first into the dark alleys of the world but who also is intelligent enough to identify, and elaborate on, his motivation to jump. A great read, patience is required but highly rewarded."
253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25545124-vanessa,Rating 4 out of 5,"I was gearing for a 5 star rating for much of this book but then I reached maximum reader fatigue with it, the ending went on and on a little too much and lost me on the way to the finish line. The Goldfinch is a book worthy of much praise Donna Tartt is an accomplished author and her writing is exquisite for the most part the book just needed abit of tightening to make it a real wow read. The book is quite gloomy and depressing with themes of grief, post traumatic stress and lots of drug references with enough depressive encounters to really put you in a real cheerless mood it was a book you felt heavy lifting literally and figuratively! There was much I was impressed with, you got a real inside view of the art and antiques scene, all the wheelings and dealings and it felt like you were invited into this secret cultural and exclusive world. At least now I can watch the movie now that I’m finally done with the book. "
254,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink,Rating 4 out of 5,"Loved, loved loved. Can we not talk about how the second half of the novel didn't live up to the first. Can we stop complaining that the Vegas section is too long and that there are too many drug references. Can we forget the ending and the technological time flaws. I had issues with it, but this is a cut above most other fiction being written at the moment. In many ways superb."

If you read, don't criticize or bash me in the comments below for royally ruining you on the book. Thank you. I'm leaving a little space after my comment above, so people won't glimpse at this without having read the book. Deep breath... First off, my hearty and biggest thank yous to those who helped me survive this book, because several parts of it were extremely difficult to endure.I couldn't exactly pinpoint how to rate this book, because it surely does deserve a bajillion Pulitzer Prizes for how beautiful it was. The Star rating would be insulting Donna Tart for unraveling the magic and meaning behind my humanities classes I had taken in college. I cannot come to speak enough of the fact that this particular book is declared as my lifetime's favorite. During the times of my humanities classes, I remember writing my required research paper on ""The Geopolitics Child Watching the Birth of the New World"" by Salvador Dali. We were assigned to describe the historical significance and important symbolism portrayed in our chosen piece and submit it. I learned a lot about the value of many paintings during my research, but never as much as I have reading The Goldfinch.It's not worth rewriting the story in the review, which I think is foolish, because it destroys a book's value; but what a novel!! Donna Tart, your research of the arts was so pronounced, it reminded me so very well of my humanities paper. I appreciated the valeur and elegance of your writing style. I have to admit I was a little apprehensive starting out, because of the book's size, but I found myself flipping pages and coming back to read it in an addict's manner to his pursuit of drugs.Your book was a learning experience. Donna Tart, the beautiful words you can rightfully use to describe something beautiful are not enough to describe your particular Goldfinch. It would never be enough. It would also never be enough to compile all my feelings and emotions to experience your piece. I hope and pray from my heart's depths that this book is willfully read to one day be declared a modern classic of its time, as it very well deserves the title. I loved the book and all of its aspects. It was an enveloping novel, as if a mother cuddling her new baby. I'm in such an awe to have learned that humanities classes are worth their continued toil, because reading the book and your intricate descriptions and fine details made me thoroughly appreciate the arts on so many different levels.I loved reading your flawless writing style with its built-in richness. Impeccable, amazing, beautiful and all the other words I can say are mere descriptions of my experience with your novel. Your cast of characters was extremely emotional, especially at the time I was reading it with everything I'm going through at the moment.I have never in my lifetime read a book and learned from real, voiced out life lessons as I just did. Your book is an experience whole encompassing of its own worth. I was delusional over the happenings of the story that I would read incessantly, I wished it was a bajillion pages. I would never in my life see it as a movie production, because of the intricacies of your details make it itself a theatrical as you read. I will describe further below, but I was so attached to the novel through the eloquence of your writing, I could see and especially hear those characters. How special, because you really make it so difficult for me to pick out words. Your novel will be the first one where I will describe my feelings over the characters, as they have a special place in my heart.First up, let's talk about the beauty of myself reading about the ""older"" Theo in the beginning. I couldn't ever have come to read a person's love and interest in his mother's life as I did with Theo. You created an amazing main character who I was so in tune with, ravenously coming back to read as he narrates the story of his thirteen year old self with his experience of his mother's loss.Welty's death was a particular shock I didn't expect. In the beginning, I thought Welty was this old man walking around the museum, like any other person in the gallery, fantasizing over the art, until I realized his truth and importance throughout the novel, but especially near the end. Pippa was a very important character, as she first had appeared with Welty in the beginning. So young, she appeared as an attractive little redhead to Theo. Tart's descriptions of the arts and music in her were emotional to me, as I'm a fan of the classical music genre as I play them myself. She beautified the novel. Every time I closed the book, she immediately came to mind first thing. Theo's first love untold and unexpressed. She most importantly is the one person who shared Theo's feelings as they came to understand each other perfectly.Hobie. He was the grandpa I never saw and wanted for myself. I could hear him as I read with his love to Theo spilling out like water in an unconditional flow. A true father in his right, and an antiques connoisseur, who truly shook my senses with his kindness. I have got to say, he taught me how to be nicer, when nice is not enough. I was overwhelmed by his graceful humility and elegance. His agility at work is a true example to apply throughout my life and career. I learned from Hobie. His character was engraved in my head with all his wisdom.Larry (Theo's father) and Xandra were the characters I truly hated. I could hear them loud and clear scolding Theo for his minute actions upon his arrival to their fancy Vegas home. Their reluctance and carelessness to Theo were so pronounced, I was pushing him to find refuge somewhere else in my thoughts. Their alcoholism and drug dealing habits were clear as daylight with a very harmful effect on Popper, until Theo had come to decide his own route. His father's death had a significance toward the very end of the novel, as Theo sat depressed and reminiscing the people in his life and their significances. The feelings bounced so intimately strong then.BORIS- Boris Always Elating (YES HE IS BAE), my ideal love. Not only did his story crack my heart to pieces, but taught me to discover an inner and innate love for travel and my love to learning languages as well. I can see and hear him cursing and speaking Russian and Polish, as well the Russian accented English. He is such a pleasure. He was Theo's main sidekick, the one who made him feel better in the form of the hilarity of incessant drug use and alcohol addictions. I loved him!!! His disappearances rendered me exhausted with worry and anxiety. His comebacks throughout the novel were my reasons to keep reading, blushing myself stupid with an inner sense of peace. He saved Theo from his constant nightmares about his hometown back in New York. A master planner, a true friend so addictively inseparable, I heard the intonations of his voice within me so loudly to the point of my heart erratically beating. At the end, I thought he was going to die on his mission, but he stood so strong, and fought along with Theo. He's the reason for Theo's maturity and personal growth. I was crying so very endlessly when he was describing Larry's importance to him to Theo at the end of the book. Tart, how did you come up with him so dirty and careless; yet loving and so caring, full of memorable instances with all his troubles so thrashing and pronounced?? You made me feel his troubles with his father after being beaten, and be jealous of every girlfriend he had, I wanted to be her. Such an addictive, fun loving personality!!! I cannot forget his sudden, crashing visit to Theo on Christmas morning with all the lessons and values that spilled like gold out of his mouth. I never could have guessed, but I was telling myself that he would be the only person to doctor Theo's depressed and suicidal moods, emotions, and thoughts. His first farewell to Theo killed me with Theo admitting his regret of not telling him ""I love you"" after that fiercely expressed heated embrace. His personality is so jubilant and elating, refreshing on a sunny drunk high morning. My all time favorite. His Russian expressions were a song, even though I don't speak it. WOW Tart, the daze and tangible sensations of myself screaming at his return were episodes of bouts of tears and emotional cackling and loud laughter to witness. Thank you for this beautiful and enlivening treat! He's true treatment to the depressed and encouragement to those in need of it. If I were to have a sidekick, he would be the only one I would choose.The Barbours:I thought they were all annoying in the beginning of the story. Andy was Theo's friend, powerfully described as a nerd taking AP classes and striving for academic growth. He was a good friend, until I further learned about his family. A father with a passion and obsession and personal love to wild and uneasy seas with crashing waves that came later to kill them both. Mrs. Barbour was a strict mom with elegance so obvious, along with a love for antique collecting. She didn't like or care for Theo in the beginning, which was sad. He had just lost his mother, and she came in barging as a truly cruel stepmother. Kitsey was the angel of the house so young, also the only girl, spoiled rotten with things she wanted, extremely pesty with Toddy and a follower of Platt's schemes against Andy and Theo.All this changed when Mr. Barbour and Andy passed away at sea. Mrs. Barbour was ultimately depressed with an infinite amount of affection for Theo, so much to almost make him encompass an idea of a love for Kitsey. Kitsey was a downright bitch and spoiled brat cheating on Theo, as her fiancé and refusing many of his willed givings and generosities only to provide her with exactly what she wanted and particularly asked for in anticipation of their premium wedding. She was annoying and aggravating throughout her life in the book. I didn't appreciate her unnecessary grandeur and self conscious habits around Theo. Popchyk, I must say that he was the happiness of this novel, especially at Boris' first reappearance. The life and happiness of Hobie's home was centered around him. Theo's mother is a mother who withstood so much through her experience with a vicious alcoholic and drug addict for a husband, prancing off the walls so ridiculous and careless for his child. A lack of interest or a will to care about Theo's life as his child that led to the eventual hatred and vindictive and revengeful nature almost that was pent up within Theo's being.The painting and the ring were the symbols of the novel, Theo's primary form of comfort and rescue. His sources of anxiety yet relief. Donna Tart's descriptions of both were my fondness of emotional attachments to the arts. So much life and memories in those two items alone, I came to realize the important connections involved with both towards the very end of the novel.Thank you very much Donna Tart for writing this masterpiece. Phenomenal and astoundingly amazing are mere words to only describe the importance of your writing style with me following Theo on his specifically grueling journey back to New York for 60 hours on a bus, panicking in his stomach for being kicked out for the discovery of Popchyk in his brown bag.This novel is my lifetime's favorite. I have never read kindness so properly felt, love so lively expressed, and sorrow so thoroughly portrayed in a book so humbly experienced. I'm so grateful to have read this particularly before Christmas as a reminder of purity, gratitude, and true feelings as they are seriously engraved in everyone of the characters, I came upon through reading. I was swept up in love with all the charisma of Tart's writing that has the experience and meaning and value that will live a lifetime. I learned from Theo something so tangible and important. Life is indeed short. It servers me well to enjoy, especially the moments of toil and hard work with a personality so passionate as Boris' to uncover life's expanse with all of its hidden meanings. This book had so many tears to flow with it touching my soul and my cordial membranes so eloquently. I'm truly touched with a different readiness for a celebratory Christmas. I can't believe I have come to write this much, I never imagined that I would ever take breaks through my writing of reviews; however, for this one, breaks of memory and thought were very much needed and very well deserved. I can't wait for you, Donna Tart to surprise me with more of this breathtakingly beautiful skill of yours. Your novel, I hope will be reread as a tradition. Grand merci!! :)"

На годиннику була 3:44 ночі, коли я нарешті дочитала, відклала книжку і почала ходити колами по кімнатці, намагаючись вкласти в голові все, що щойно буквально залпом проковтнула. Вірите чи ні, але ""Щигля"" Тарт я прочитала за неповних вісім годин. Як від нього узагалі можна відірватися?Вдруге ""Щиголь"" пішов важче, але вражен��я залишилися такими ж - це абсолютно шедеврально, неймовірно і прекрасно. Мої епітети ніякі, але повірте на слово - недарма Донна Тарт писала цю книжку десять років; кожен витрачений нею день на створення цієї історії вартує тисячі звичайних, а події в книжці захоплюють так, що під кінець вам захочеться розтягнути все ще на двадцять років, аби лиш не розлучатися з героями.Отже, це сповідь. Як і в ""Моє каяття"" Жауме Кабре (іншої аналогії в голову не приходить), головний герой - тут у нас Теодор Деккер - у холодному номері готелю у затишному закутку Амстердаму розмірковує про події, які привели його сюди. Про себе дванадцтирічного, чия успішність в школі впала до нуля, тому його відсторонили та викликали в кабінет директора разом з мамою, про відвідини музею перед лякаючим візитом, про руду дівчинку, яка, здається, прийшла глянути на картини разом зі своїм дідусем, про метушню в сусідніх залах, про маму, яка відійшла у магазин музею, щоб придбати подарунок співробітниці, про ту саму дівчинку, яку Тео сподівався побачити ще раз і чекав її біля ""Щигля"", маленької і до неможливості красивої й зворушливої картини Фабриціуса і, зрештою, про вибух, який розколов життя цього дванадцятилітки навпіл.Зважаючи на те, що це спогади-зізнання Тео у старшому віці, а ще Тео-під-впливом-чорт-зна-яких-наркотиків-і-почуття-вини, книжка сповнена рефлексій на різні теми - від мистецтва до Смерті, від добра до зла, від дружби і до ненависті, помсти, байдужості. Донна Тарт зачарувала мене монологом Бориса, змусила на якусь часточку душі запрагнути стати реставратором як Гобі, показала виворіт складних родинних стосунків Барбурів, змусивши перестати їх засуджувати, що я лише й те робила, незважаючи на друге прочитання, нагадавши при цьому всьому, що є щось значно важливіше в кожній історії - емоції простих людських стосунків, філософія й мистецтво складних людських душ.Я заздрю всім і кожному, хто лише братиметься за цю книжку. Я чекаю, щоб минуло ще два, три, п'ять або десять років, коли різні події, люди, ситуації та книжки змусять мене забути хоч часточку сюжету, щоб я могла взятися за ""Щигля"" знову. Хоча не вірю в це ані на мить:""Ви можете дивитися на картину цілий тиждень і потім жодного разу не згадати про неї. А можете дивитися на картину секунду й потім думати про неї все своє життя"".""Якщо картина справді запала тобі в душу, змінила твій світогляд, примусила тебе думати й відчувати інакше, аніж ти досі думав і відчу��ав, то ти не думаєш ""о, мені подобається ця картина, бо вона універсальна"" або ""мені подобається ця картина, бо вона озивається до всього людства"", це не причина, щоб любити витвір мистецтва. Його люблять за таємний шепіт, що звертається до тебе: ""Псс, ти. Гей, хлопче. Атож, ти"". - Це стискання кожного конкретного серця. Твоя мрія. Мрія Велті, мрія Вермеєра. Ти бачиш одну картину, я бачу іншу, книжка з мистецтва подає її під іншим кутом зору, леді, яка купує в сувенірній крамниці картку з її зображенням, бачить у ній абсолютно щось своє, і я ще не згадую про людей, відокремлених від нас часом, - людей, які жили чотириста років тому й житимуть через чотириста років після того, як ми попрощаємося з життям, - ця картина ніколи не вплине на різних людей однаково, а більшість узагалі не зверне на неї уваги, але справді велика картина достатньо плинна, щоб проникнути у свідомість і серце під багатьма різними кутами унікальними й найрізномантнішими способами. Твоя, твоя. Мене намалювали для тебе""."
259,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52500467-whatireallyread,Rating 5 out of 5,"THIS BOOK IS BLOODY BRILLIANT!!!!!!!! Okay, so I didn't love it as much for maybe the first half of the book. But then.... well, let's start at the beginning. (spoiler-free)On the first pages of The Goldfinch we find a bunch of disjointed info, including the fact that the main character's mom died in some strange accident. Then Theo decides to tell the whole story and backs up. He tells us what happened when he was 13, the accident, the things that led up to it, the days afterward, and it's all relayed in a very detailed manner. The space of a couple of days takes about a 100 pages. For a while Theo doesn't know what happened to his Mom, he keeps waiting and fretting and hoping, not knowing if she's okay. And I would have shared that nervousness if I didn't already know from the first page of the book that she died. As it was, I felt like the whole thing was way too dragged out. The other issue that kept me less-than-ecstatic for the first half of the book - I didn't know where any of it was going. For a person who spends so much time groaning about tropes on Goodreads, I felt surprisingly out of my element without them. I kept trying to figure out ""what kind of book it was"", ""what it was trying to say"", and failing. It was unsettling. Apparently, I read so much genre fiction, the more ""serious"" literary fiction in all of its tropeless glory made me uncomfortable. I was very happy when Boris' character was introduced. Though, I kept trying not to get too attached, because I didn't believe a Ukrainian character would be featured for more than one chapter. But, luckily for me, he turned out to be an important figure, so all my love was not wasted. I was surprised at how alive and realistic and relatable he felt! Most Eastern European characters I've seen in American literature felt like caricatures, but Boris was 100% real. I don't know how Donna Tartt did it, but the cultural context and thoughts and spirit - something unnamable - had me recognizing Boris, nodding along to what he was saying, even though our lives are in no way similar. But then, all of the characters were full-fledged human beings. They were so versatile and complex and imperfect and alive... I can't even.And the writing... the writing... Oh, God the writing was just exquisite, beautiful, absolutely delicious! (You see, can't help but ramble) The author has such a brilliant grasp for detail, an uncanny insight into building a life so real it feels like your own. Everything - the dialogue, the thoughts and feelings, the places and circumstances she described contributed to my firm belief that Donna Tartt is a genius.Until about the last quarter of the book, The Goldfinch was not particularly plot-driven, and even though I enjoyed reading it, it was not light reading, and I wasn't compelled to rush towards the end. So I sailed peacefully along the pages, until SHIT HIT THE FAN and than I gobbled down the rest of it and had MY MIND BLOWN.After finishing it, there I sat, speechless. With my brains smeared all over the wall behind me, the blood of my wrenched-out heart dripping on the carpet. It took me over a month to read, and it's been over a month since I finished it, and still I CAN'T EVEN. The quotes, the thoughts and characters still haunt me in feverish dreams. So I recommend it to absolutely everyone."

However, the novel is overly long in places and probably should have been edited more closely for length. I found myself skimming near the end. The end itself is worth reading for the culmination of philosophical musings by the narrator. Overall, an interesting read, but I can’t say I care where these characters go next or feel any hint of remorse at finishing the text. "

262,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149694522-karen,Rating 2 out of 5,"I read and discussed this awhile ago with our library book group and I am now bringing my review to Goodreads. This is a Pulitzer Prize winner. Does it mean it is a good or a great book? I will be blunt with my personal opinion. My answer: No. Premise: This is the story of a teenager. Theo Decker. He survives a terrorist bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art while losing his mother in the attack. He walks off with the real-life 1654 masterpiece, The Goldfinch. And off we go with this story.This is a 784 page book. Another one of those books where the author feels they have a lot of story to tell. It is sprawling. It has larger-than-life characters. There are dark deeds. Surprising twists. And in the end, an emotional kick in the gut. Stephen King called this book, ""a smartly written library novel that connects with the heart as well as the mind."" Readers around the world agreed with him. Except this reader. Me. Maybe a few in my library group, too. I kept wondering if I was reading the same book he was? I remember sitting around the table with fellow book enthusiasts and we asked the question, what makes a work literature, and who gets to decide - especially whether it is worthy of a Pulitzer? We shook our heads and decided we really couldn't answer these simple questions - especially as it applied to The Goldfinch. Our complaint: the book seems to represent itself as serious fiction - but in our experience, we weren't feeling it. Some of the characters were more like caricatures. As far as the story, how will Theo get out of his situation? How will he grow up? Why did we have more questions than answers. It just seemed like the plot kept going on and on and on - but to where? And the characters - were any of them even likable? Most importantly...Is this a book that stands the test of time? You know like Steinbeck, or Jane Austen, or the Bronte sisters, or Wallace Stegner. You tell me. "

Because the moon is the same wherever you go."" i had written a review before, but i'm re-writing it due to incoherence. i don't think the goldfinch is a bad book, but i think it has too many flaws and i fail to understand why people enjoy it. it took me ten days to read this book, and it was a grueling ten days. to this day it's still the longest book i've ever read. from the beginning, i loved this book. i loved how tartt described the museum, and theo, and boris. how they met, their interactions, relationships, all of it. i was totally and utterly obsessed. the way she wrote theo and boris' dynamic was incredible and i hadn't read anything like it before. it felt like a real glimpse into a coming-of-age story. for the most part.once i got to the halfway point, it went downhill for me. so downhill that it might as well have exploded and died. boris becomes violently racist. obviously you can write racist characters, you can write them and then acknowledge their faults and why they're wrong, but tartt... doesn't do that? when people talk about their love for this book i always notice that they tend to glaze over the racist aspects. there are so many stereotypes and slurs and vile caricatures of other races that tartt uses. i got to a certain point and was genuinely in shock because of how disgusting the language was. most of the time it was tartt herself describing people, it wasn't even like it was written through the eyes of uneducated white teenagers. it was just donna tartt. it's hard to give this book any sort of praise whatsoever. the language in this book is it's greatness and downfall. almost 900 pages of liquid gold descriptions of buildings and settings, but also vile racist language. the amount of sheer bigotry wrapped up into this single novel is bizarre. "
264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14453898-sofia,Rating 4 out of 5,"One of the questions that raised their heads whilst I was reading this is Why is beauty/art important in our lives?  Why do we cling to the line of beauty as a beacon in our lives, medicore as they may be. Maybe it is hope, joy, the better, a window into what could be or much more closer to my own philosophy, a perspective. Because if we are able to see the beautiful bits in whatever situation we are in, we are able to bring joy in our lives, joy we can use to climb out of whatever pit we are in.
And isn't the whole point of things - beautiful things - that they connect you to some larger beauty? Those first images that crack your heart wide open and you spend the rest of your life chasing, or trying to recapture, in one way or another?.
Is The Goldfinch only the little yellow bird chained to it's perch or is it also Theo, chained to the disasters that changed the course of his life and that blinded him to the little joys around him.  And yes here you can see me nodding at Hobie's place, I love that workshop. Maybe the beauty of the The Goldfinch and letting that beauty out into the open is what allowed Theo to see the sunshine.This is one of those books that merrily wrecks havoc on your reading challenge numbers which you've not checked since you started the book because you'd rather stay and read some more or think some more, whatever......"
265,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14773738-julie,Rating 1 out of 5,"My generosity overfloweth today, in granting this absurd waste of time 1 full star. In my defence for having read 370 pages of this 800+ page tome (tomb?) I need to admit I was convalescing post-surgery and was tied to a bed, so I couldn't get up and throw it out the window ... or into the blaze of a wood stove. More's the pity. Absurdly at one particular 2 a.m. reading, I thought I could just eat the pages and thus destroy at least one copy of this waste of good paper. It made me wonder of the new kinds of torture that they devise for post-op patients to hurry their recovery out of hospital. This almost backfired on them, as I found myself slipping into a coma every 15 pages, then every 10, ... every 9 ... Soon, it became apparent that if I did not rid myself of this weight, I would succumb utterly. Dickensian? Perhaps, if Dickens had indulged in opium 24/7 and had delved into the pock-marked minutiae of pimply-faced, pimply-minded adolescents, ranging in ages from 13 to 113. Dickens was never so blind, so lazy, so immensely uninformed and unaware of his society as Ms. Tartt is of hers. Poor old Dickens, to be compared to Donna Tartt. I bemoan the state, and fate, of literature if readers think Ms Tartt evokes Dickensian art. The book is lazily written, and tired to the extreme. I re-invent words for sleep when I think of this work. Dull and interminable also come to mind. Overburdened with millions of little nothings. I think I'm in full blown PTSD.

This book is the account of Theo's life after this event, how he tries to deal with loss and how he seeks comfort in a painting - a piece of beauty that death cannot touch.There are some wonderful characters in this story, I loved the character of Pippa, Boris and Hobie. I loved the way despite their awful, neglected lives the boys cared about Poppchyk when they left. I desperately wanted things to be different and wanted the boys to make different choices. Both boys so badly affected by the loss of their mothers, although their relationship with each other was destructive it was also touching and suprisingly it is Boris that makes a sensible decision eventually. This book is sad and very emotional. I would like to see another book continuing Theo's life from where this book finishes."

273,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair,Rating 4 out of 5,"Originally published as a blog post: Disjointed thoughts on Donna Tartt's The Goldfinch.First line: While I was still in Amsterdam, I dreamed about my mother for the first time in years.A few months ago, a very generous and lovely Goodreads friend (Karen) gave me the opportunity to read Donna Tartt's much-anticipated new novel, The Goldfinch. I read it as soon as my copy arrived, in mid-August. Then I sat down to write a review and couldn't think of what to say. I told myself there was no rush - after all, as the ARC wasn't strictly mine, I wasn't sure about the rules regarding writing about it online, and I guessed I probably shouldn't publish a review until nearer its official release date. Now, however, the publication date is almost upon us - it's released in the UK on the 22nd of October - and I still haven't written anything. This is such a hard book to write about, and as such, the following paragraphs are more a collection of thoughts than a structured review.It is very difficult, in fact virtually impossible, for me to talk about my thoughts on The Goldfinch without referring to my feelings about 
The Secret History
. As far as books are concerned, The Secret History is the love of my life. I fell for it when I was still an impressionable reader: I was starting to get into literary fiction, but hadn't read enough to have an established canon of very-favourites. In the intervening years, I have read much, much more, and I recognise that The Secret History cannot truly be said to be the best book ever in a technical sense, but it is still the one I love the most. I feel angry and defensive when people criticise it; I urge everyone I know to read it; I am forever searching for similar stories (I even have a shelf dedicated to them on Goodreads) in the hope that they will inspire and excite me even half as much. These days, even when I find books I really love, I feel that they are less special partly because I read so much. The Secret History came into my life at a time when reading for pleasure wasn't so much of an integral part of my identity, and I put it on a pedestal, where it has remained ever since: the perfect, untouchable novel, the one amazing hit I'll spent a lifetime trying to recreate.Anyway, back to The Goldfinch, it is a story about the life of a boy called Theo Decker. I say boy because although the book spans Theo's progression from child to adult, he is a somewhat immature character, and never really seems to grow up. Not that he doesn't have any justification for being emotionally stunted: he is only thirteen years old when his beloved mother is killed in a freak accident, when an art gallery, of all things, is bombed. Theo blames himself - the two of them were only visiting the gallery because he had been excluded from school, where they were later due to attend a meeting with his principal. After a period living with a friend's family and then some time spent in Las Vegas with his formerly estranged father, he returns to the city and seeks out an art dealer who also has connections with the accident. Throughout all of this, though, Theo has been keeping a secret: he took a painting from the gallery in the aftermath of the blast, a valuable miniature of a goldfinch. Despite feeling guilty and paranoid about his illegitimate ownership of the artwork, he is unable to part with it, feeling it is the only remaining connection he has to his mother's life. It is the goldfinch painting which will draw him into the dark underworld of art forgery, and will ultimately bring about his downfall.There's not a lot more I can say about the plot of this novel, partly because it's a sprawling epic and I don't want to spoil how it develops for anyone else, partly because I didn't actually find it all that memorable. That sounds like a criticism and is one of the reasons I found it so hard to write up my thoughts on The Goldfinch: I didn't actually like Theo very much and that made it quite difficult to care about the various predicaments he found himself in. What I loved about the book was its scope, its detail and its realism. It is a more fully realised, mature and well-written work than The Secret History - it grows, evolves and constantly re-shapes itself rather than sticking to a small group of characters or a neat series of events. Tartt's prose is near-perfect and the narrative is full of small, magical details and descriptions. The result is a book I loved for the details rather than the whole. I can't honestly say I was particularly bothered about the main story arc involving the painting and the possibility of Theo being ruined - I was more concerned with the development of Theo's character, the introduction and lasting impact of his high school best friend Boris, the smallest incidental scenes and passing moments, the language Tartt chose to use, the quality and authenticity of the world of The Goldfinch.If I was truly disappointed in anything about this book, it was the relationships. I found the whole idea of Theo being in love with Pippa a bit hackneyed and predictable - I never bought it, although at least Tartt did highlight, within Theo's own narrative, the idea that he'd 'imprinted' on Pippa and his feelings for her were tied up with his love for his mother, guilt over her death, etc. I also felt there were some issues around the way Theo constantly described Pippa as plain and unattractive, as if to highlight how very REAL his feelings for her must be since she wasn't anything to look at. Maybe this was deliberate - maybe he was trying to convince himself rather than Tartt trying to convince the reader - but I'd have been more likely to believe in this dubious 'love' if she had been stereotypically beautiful. For me, this book was so much more about the love story that was Theo and Boris's friendship, and some part of me was so disappointed that this thread wasn't developed further, and in a different way. My favourite scene in The Goldfinch, the part that moved me the most, was the end of part xix of Chapter 6: I think a lot of people will instantly know what I mean and will wholeheartedly agree once they've read it. For my part, I was by this point very much in love with Boris myself, and couldn't help feeling that his character was too memorable and scene-stealing for the rest of the book's own good.Despite my love for The Secret History, I've never got round to reading Tartt's second novel 
The Little Friend
, so this is just a guess, but I feel certain The Goldfinch has a lot more in common with the latter than the former. If you adore The Secret History as I do (and I know a lot of people do), you're going to have to accept that this new book can't be expected to recreate its unique magic, but it is powerful and incredibly impressive in its own right. It is the sort of book you should read slowly, savour, and then flick through and re-read in dribs and drabs for years afterwards. While it won't be sitting alongside its cult-classic predecessor on my personal list of all-time favourite books, it is technically better than The Secret History and most of the books I've rated five stars this year. I can't wait to hear what the rest of the world (and my fellow Secret History obsessives) think of The Goldfinch, and it's a treat that's worth the lengthy wait."

Her prose is stunning and the way the book starts, with the scene in the museum, pulls you in so fast that before you know it, you're emotionally involved with the protagonist and swept up in the story. Bravo. Full recommendation!!!!!"
275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3260895-stuart,No Rating,"2013 was a good year for books for me, and this one is at the top of the fiction list. A writer can aim for five elements in a novel: ideas, characterization, language, story, and scope. Most writers, even the best, can't do five of these well in one book. It's a daunting task and few even try. It's the domain of lasting works of fiction. That's what Tartt aims for with The Goldfinch.The Goldfinch is a big, fat book (I kind of wish I had an electronic version or more to the point my cat probably wished that I had an electronic version when occasionally this tome would bonk her on the head while she was sitting on my lap), the kind that is so rich with imagination that you can live inside it for a couple of weeks at least. It took over my life. I've heard and read the criticisms of this book. It could be a lot shorter. The ideas here are not the stuff of Dostoevsky or Mann or any of the old greats. I can agree with those criticisms, but I still love this book. The Goldfinch is like a big old house that you bought because of its curb appeal. Yes, it's a bit of a money pit and it has so many rooms that your heating bill is astronomical, but when you sit in the living room or your study with your scotch, look around, and notice the fabulous detail on the woodwork you can't help but think, ""You know they don't make houses like this anymore.""Everyone mentions Dickens when they talk about this book. I'll do it, too. Dickens, Dickens, Dickens, Dickens, Dickens. There, I got that out of the way. Yes, every face in this novel gets a capsule of a description. Yes, by contemporary standards this book is wildly overwritten. As they say where I live, this is just the way the book (and Tartt) rolls. It's Tartt's world and you're just living in it for a while. You could rent a room in a Motel 6 (I won't mention Motel 6 type writers here, but there are plenty of them), but why would you want to do that?The Goldfinch tells a corker of a story about a young teen, Theo Decker, permanently scarred by the loss of his mother during a terrorist bombing at the Metropolitan Museum. He manages by luck to escape the bombing not only with his life, but with a ring that a dying man asks him to deliver to a house and a world famous Dutch painting, The Goldfinch. For the next decade or so, three lifetimes worth of tragedy happen to Theo in New York, Las Vegas and Amsterdam. Along the way he finds a lifetime friend, Boris, who is both colorful and a bit of a Soviet cliche, and a lifetime unrequited love. The painting marks and scars Theo nearly as much as the real losses of loved ones that he endures, which is the major idea pursued in this novel.Donna Tartt knows like you-know-who (rhymes with thickens) how to create a page turner, how to use foreshadowing, and how to twist at just the right time. I could complain that Theo is tied to the tracks one too many times to hold interest, but the worst offense - a love gone bad - is thankfully a brief (by Tartt standards) part of the novel. I don't mean to dwell on flaws because, all in all, this is a masterful telling of an engaging story placed on a humongous canvas. The Goldfinch is a first rate, world class achievement that fully deserves the praise it has received."
276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2604014-carol,Rating 5 out of 5,"Excellent writing, honestly I couldn't put this book down. This is my first book by Donna Tartt and what a way to begin! First I went to the Frick to see the masterpieces of Dutch paintings from the Mauritshuis, just amazing! This is it's last stop in its 2 year tour. The Goldfinch (1654) below was painted by one of Rembrandt's most gifted pupils, Carel Fabritius. Fabritius was the only one to develop his own artistic style. A typical Rembrandt portrait would have a plain dark background with the subject defined by spotlighting. In contrast, Fabritius' portraits feature delicately lit subjects against light-coloured, textured backgrounds.- The Goldfinch, 1654, oil on panel, 13 inches tall by 9 inches wide.The Goldfinch was a popular pet during this time period. Some scholars believe that the delicate chain hanging from the top perch is keeping the bird from flying away. It may have suggested to have a moralized message about domesticity and flight.Highly naturalistic paintings like this are known as ""trompe l'oeil"", a popular genre meant to fool the eye and highlight the artist's painterly skills. The wooden box behind the bird is a mystery. Goldfinches were known for performing a special trick, of fetching their own drinking water by pulling up a chain, attached to a tiny cup inside a water filled container. Fabritius was one of the most brilliant artists to emerge in 17th century Holland. Unfortunately he died young, when a explosion next to his Delft studio erupted the very year that this painting was made. (Audio text from Frick Museum.)I think that there is something here regarding a ""moralizing message about domesticity and flight"" with regards to Theo. He and his mom visit the MET when a sudden explosion erupts and everything in his life changes. Theo emerges from the nightmare with a ring from a dying man and The Goldfinch painting. Throughout the book, Theo goes from family to family (alcoholic step dad to his childhood friend's wealthy family, The Barbours and Hobie, antique restorer, and Pippa, the girl Theo loves.) Theo moves to Las Vegas with his alcoholic step dad living in an empty McMansion, in a half-finished Las Vegas housing development. Only in Vegas can you meet fakes, copies and illusions. This is where Theo makes friends with Boris, a worldly Ukrainian teenager who introduces him to all kinds of drugs. Theo has the painting with him but can't look at it, as he puts it into storage for safe keeping. Theo takes ""flight"" from NYC to Las Vegas back to NYC and to Amsterdam. It seems that Theo has many ""families""but he is cautious. Hobie's takes Theo under his wing to mentor him in furniture restoration. Hobie's viewpoint is 
""beauty alters the grain of reality""
; but then again, so do drugs. Boris masterminds their daily shoplifting sprees, as Theo hides his stolen painting. Later in Amsterdam, Theo will later be part of the murky underworld of art felony, leading to a showdown."

First off - Tartt is a master of her craft, and her characters are just interesting as hell. She’s also sneaky with her twists, and it keeps her stories fresh and moving at a good pace. Particularly, the twist at the end of the book does an excellent job - not only catching you by surprise - but moving the story into a very different, much better direction.Near the beginning of the book, Theo’s only parent - his beloved mother - is killed in a bombing while they’re enjoying a day at the art museum.This isn’t a spoiler or a twist - it’s in the blurb...And the way Tartt has Theo deal with this loss by preserving something beautiful - the painting - The Goldfinch... that’s mostly what this story is about. And although this is beautiful in a reflective-sort of way - there’s obviously a lot more to this 900 page book.There’s the family dynamics of Theo dealing with his mother’s death, and how much he loved her, and that leading to self-destruction, and him turning into his father.He briefly lives with a girl, Kitsy, who has something similar happen - and Theo and Kitsy eventually end up in an emotionally-devoid, yet-somehow-functional relationship - mostly bonding over all the loss in their life.There’s Pippa - who also lost someone dear to her in the bombing - the same day as Theo, and Theo’s obsession with her. And there’s Hobbie, Pippa's caretaker - whom Theo ends up working for, getting into antiques repair and sales (and a bit of antiques fraud). This sort of explores the whole preservation of art theme at the same time as Theo's family dynamic and self-destructive cycle. Brilliant!But my big problem is… This book is 900 pages, and although that all sounds great… Doesn’t that sound exactly like a family drama play to you? I mean, yes, this story takes place over 20 years… But… still. And MOST importantly, the book is so introspective and so spread out that Theo is the ONLY major character. Everyone else is so minor since they only spend time with Theo for short periods.Take Kitsy for example - you don't really meet her until the 3rd act. You never even hear about her in the 2nd act. And sure, she might've existed in the first act - and Tartt does develop Kitsy's character through hints at who she was through conversations with Theo in the 3rd act... But... That's not enough.Even Boris, who is definitely the next major character... Theo doesn't meet him until the second act, which is fine... EXCEPT he's gone for most of the third act, too!Theo's story meanders too much for anyone else to shine enough.And so, although I see what people LOVE about this book in the All the Light We Cannot See sort of way… And although many parts of this book I did really enjoy myself - given the length - I needed a lot more from this story."

El elemento principal y que llamó más mi atención una vez empecé esta lectura fue la manera en que está escrito. Las descripciones de lugares, sentimientos y del arte en sÍ mismo es perfecto. Nos cuenta con tanto detalle y cuidado cada uno de los pensamientos de Theo, que me dio la sensación de estar leyendo algo intimo y en especial sincero. Se nota que la autora le puso todo su corazón a la historia y simplemente me conquistó de principio a fin. Es la narrativa lo que hace que la novela no se sienta extensa, pesada o aburrida. De hecho es todo lo contrario; Theo nos va a contar todo con tanta emoción, crudeza y realidad que va a ser imposible soltar la lectura y eso es impresionante. La forma en que está escrita es tan buena, que me atrevería a decir que este ha sido uno de los mejores narradores que he leído en mucho tiempo.•Personajes. Característica que me hizo cuestionarme muchísimo por qué estaba amando este libro a pesar de que ningún personaje fuera bueno del todo, incluido el protagonista; y la realidad es que la magia de leer esta novela es profundizar en cada uno de los personajes y ver sus principios, qué les remueve, cómo se desmoronan y siguen adelante. Leer sus altas y bajas, llegar a conocer su lado brillante y también el oscuro. Es este tipo de historia, llena de matices y situaciones duras, la que me hace ver lo importante que es tener la literatura en nuestra vida. Leer estas historias, que a lo mejor están muy alejadas de nuestra realidad, son el día a día de otros, y leerlas es esencial.•Final. Fue el final lo que me convenció de darle cinco estrellas, ya que es maravilloso. Se corresponde perfecto con la trama y desarrollo del libro, es realista y me hizo profundamente feliz. No esperaba cerca este libro y sentirme realizada y al final así fue. No pudo haber terminado mejor y sé que Theo, esté dónde esté, es feliz, por lo que yo también lo soy. 🎨 c o n c l u s i ó n 🎨Tienen que leer este libro porque fue perfecto, de principio a fin. No hay nada que le cambiaría y vale la pena leer cada una de las 1142 páginas que lo conforman. Es la mejor lectura que he hecho este año y no podré olvidarla en mucho tiempo.~Alaska🍃"

La scena dell’attentato per esempio è un lunghissimo e lentissimo piano sequenza ed è roba buona per davvero. Bello soprattutto l’ingresso del quadro, Il cardellino, appunto, nella storia. E per tutto il racconto, quando appare la scena si illumina. Compresa la parte finale.Le successive duecento fanno accendere sul cruscotto la spia ""cheppalle!"". Prima gialla, a intermittenza. Passate quelle la spia diventa rossa e poi fissa. Ad un certo punto ti accorgi che la lentezza che rendeva così bene nella prima parte diventa pedanteria. La voce narrante evolve, cambia registro, ma il vizio di dettagliare e scrivere come ascoltasse l’eco che fa, resta. Ogni passaggio di trama, ogni ambiente, ogni concetto ne esce gonfiato, ingigantito; con l’effetto di banalizzare anche quel che banale non sarebbe. Molti dicono che è troppo lungo. A me è venuto da pensare che, frattagliando, prolissando e prolassando sarebbe potuto anche essere lungo il doppio o il triplo o il quadruplo o non finire mai.A parte il girare troppo a vuoto (che non è poca cosa) per stile e contenuto, non è un best-seller spazzatura. La sensazione è stata piuttosto quella di una cosa “di plastica”. Come le persone “di plastica” esistono anche i romanzi “di plastica”. Più o meno le caratteristiche sono le stesse e qui ci sono tutte: l’approccio brillante, uno stile curato, sono perfettini e trasgressivi quanto basta, hanno la giusta dose di tuttumpò, qualche bella pagina (di vita o di racconto, è lo stesso), qualche buona battuta, un'ideuzza niente male qua e là, una lezioncina finale. Sostanza poca e non di pregio. Li metti via senza troppo piangerci sopra. Che pure una virtù è. In questo target, nel suo genere, questo libro fa la sua figura. Ma ti lascia la sensazione di artificiale, di “molto costruito” e poco più. Plastica, appunto."

It was one of those absorbing stories that infiltrated my waking and sleeping hours long after I was done. I didn’t attempt The Little Friend because I got the impression I would have found it disappointing. But when I saw the reviews of The Goldfinch on GR from people who had read advanced copies (I didn’t even know there was such a thing as advanced copies for mere non-publishing-industry mortals!), and that same week realized that I knew someone who had regular access to advanced copies, I knew I had to try to get a copy. Days later, it was in my sweaty little hands. An excerpt from the back of the book: “The Goldfinch is a novel of striking energy and power. It combines unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language, and breath-taking suspense while plumbing with a philosopher’s calm the deepest mysteries of love, identity and art.” I couldn’t put it much better than that. I don’t share the world view of Theo Decker or, I suspect, of Donna Tartt. I felt that Theo’s voice was awfully similar to the main character, Richard, in The Secret History. But the story of Theo’s life is told in such a gorgeous and mesmerizing manner, I again had that feeling that there was only a gauzy barrier between my life and his.

It took me 2.5 hours to read the first chapter, I enjoy literacy fiction however I found the descriptions way too detailed and while it wasn't a slog it wasn't enjoyable either. Then I hit chapter two and I'm not sure if it got less descriptive and more readable or I had gotten use to the language style but from that point I was well on the way to enjoying the journey. And this book is a journey, we meet Theo as a teen and we go through a lot. This has a lot of A Little Life vibes, its bleak, desperate, raw and I couldn't stop reading. I was fully invested in Theo and his Goldfinch. I really enjoyed the character of Boris, while he is also on the same path of despair as Theo i felt his personality and life outlook eased some of the tension and he has some brilliant one liners that made me laugh out loud. And then the ending,  the last 5% I reverted back to how I felt in chapter one, it felt long winded, over descriptive again. The last 50 pages could have been cut in half easily. All in all I really was absorbed in this story, I felt like i was watching a car crash of my best friends, I cared and watching their paths was painful at times but I couldn't look away. I'm definitely going to read more from this author. 4 stars."

It tells the story of Theo Decker, a young boy whose mother dies and whose life suddenly comes apart as a result. It is a story about art and life, trauma, friendship, and morality. I found much of the book fascinating and I especially enjoyed the ending. However, I also felt many parts dragged and I wished the book had been a little more heavily edited.On the whole, though, The Goldfinch is an extremely satisfying read, both emotionally and intellectually."

288,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,Rating 5 out of 5,"**** Update: **** Apparently, this is one of those novels in which with further contemplation and deeper absorption of the reading, one can feel differently about it. For me, or was the further and deeper appreciation of the concluding chapter. This is where Donna Tartt's talent truly lights up a reader's world. First through Hobie's words regarding art: how it affects each of us differently; how true art is interpreted differently by every individual, how it transcends time, age, worlds, lifetimes; how loving inanimate objects rather than living beings might be atypical but necessary for some. Then through Theodore's exaltations, one understands life in so many new ways. I say this about so few books, but this was truly astonishing in its quality. --------------------- Much has already been said regarding this Pulitzer Prize Winner, so I shall leave this relatively short. Quite the tome of a novel @ 771 pages, Donna Tartt pulled it off well. For me, it started off as a Three Star, gradually became a Five Star, but tapered off a little with the concluding chapters, ending with Four Stars. The aspect I appreciated the most was the fact that the entire narrative centers around the painting. The novel itself was about so much more. It was about Theodore Decker's lifelong struggle with dealing with his mother's death when he was only thirteen. It was about his experience dealing with a transcendent experience, taking to Welty during the last moments is his life as the museum wake came down around them, the debris clouding his vision, his thoughts, his mind. It was about Welty's encouragement that he takes the painting from the wall, the painting that happened to be his mother's very favorite. It was about this one decision that set the pace for the rest of his life. It was about his questionable relationship with his gambling father, his friendship (more than?) with the German Boris, the boy that fatally introduced him to a life of alcohol, drugs, and crime. It was about his methods of coping with not only his mother's death, but also his father's, and his childhood friend Andy's (it was quite indicative to see how his coping mechanisms differed but also stayed the same with each). It was about his lifelong friendship with Welty's partner in the antiques/upholstery trade, Hobie; his lifelong pursuit of what he could never have, Welty's beautiful redheaded daughter Pippa (although she cared for him deeply, she did not love him in that way). Yet, the narrative always would circle back to the painting, right when the reader might have forgotten about it. Throughout his life, sometimes indirectly, sometimes directly, the painting changed his life, determined the course of events, saved his life, almost cost him his life. Random notes on other characters. Pippa I never felt like I knew; I could only see her from a removed vantage point, like how Theo saw her. Especially when the chance Everette was introduced. Hobie was ever so dear since day one. His kindness, sweetness, loyalty, integrity. He was probably my favorite from the full cast of characters. Mrs. Barbour was one I had trouble really getting to know. I could empathize with some of her needs to making up appearances, knew she really lined Theo deals her resistance to actually showing it, but I still saw her in shadow. I did empathize with Mr. Barbour's mental institution experiences. Platt I did not like, but he did redeem himself later. Andy I really liked and therefore grieved. Kitsey? Loved her as a child, how happy she made Theo, but after they were engaged and the infedelity, the conning, the marriage of convenience, the truth was revealed? Could not forgive her. That leads me to Boris. Maybe my most disputed opinion, but I really disliked him, maybe even hated him. The only positive influence he has as far as The was concerned was pulling him out of depression a few times. Even that should be considered negative, however, as barely ever was it fun that did not involve alcohol, drugs, crime; almost always all three. I take that back. It never did not involve one of those three vices. And never in moderation. Boris saved Theo's life a few times, but always from things caused by Boris. On the other hand, Theo saved Boris's life at least once from things still caused by Boris. The worst thing Boris did to him that Theo inexplicably forgave for the most part? Trading Theo's most precious thing in life, that which gave him a reason to live, for a Civics Book. How could he? The loss of loyalty! Everything a friendship stands for! And for what? Greed, of course! The f*cking b@%#@rd! Almost nothing he could have done could have made it up to Theo. But what did he do? Barely apologize, take him right into danger, yet again, force Theo to shoot a man for the first time in his life, then expect money to make everything alright again. No, Boris, we do not pay off our loved ones. Love cannot be bought. At least the painting was returned to the proper care of the museum. Alas, an epic story, a life narrative of a brave boy. With all the heartache Theo Decker had to endure, it was those whom he was fortunate enough to have enter his life, letting in much needed sunshine, that made it all worth it."

Neke druge isto pročitamo, pomalo zastanemo i zapitamo se nad njima, ali ne u nekoj značajnijoj meri. Postoje i knjige koje čitamo iznova i iznova, i za koje već na njihovim prvim stranicama znamo da će potpasti u onu najređu grupu knjiga – knjige koje ne čitamo, već koje osećamo. Iskreno, nakon što sam sada već odavno pročitao ''Ljubavnika'' Margerit Diras, nisam mislio da će mi se tako nešto ponovo desiti, a onda se pojavila Dona Tart sa svojom zlatnom pticom.Pre nego što prodrem dublje u analizu samog dela, želim javno da se zahvalim mojom mami (nije nimalo slučajno što je majčinska ljubav jedan od lajtmotiva ovog romana) kupila izdanje ovog romana, u fenomenalnom prevodu Vesne Stojković, jer ga sam ne bih kupio, a teško da bih se u neko skorije vreme naterao da sednem i pročitam izdanje na engleskom (a sad iskreno jedva čekam da pročitam ovaj roman i u originalu).Bojim se da će moj prikaz biti dosta zbrkan, jer nije prošlo mnogo kako sam zaklopio korice romana, i celo telo mi drhti od uzbuđenja, ali braniću se time da je jedino tako ispravno kad su ,,prave’’ knjige u pitanju, a takođe je i u duhu Done Tart i njenih nepouzdanih naratora.Počeću od toga da je od 600+ knjiga koliko sam pročitao u životu, ovo ubedljivo najbolje napisana knjiga koja mi je dopala šaka. U ''Tajnoj istoriji'' sam dobio nagoveštaj Donine savršene veštine kombinovanja reči i rečenica, ali ''Češljugar''prikazuje jednog prekaljenog majstora pisane reči kome nema ravnog. ''Češljugar'' je jedina knjiga kojoj uspeva da, i kada govori o apsolutno ničemu, govori o apsolutno svemu. Čitaocu pažnje i koncentracije ne nestaje, već svim čulima uživa u svakoj sceni, ma koliko naizgled kratkoj i nebitnoj, i svakom toku misli glavnog junaka. Ni u jednom trenutku tokom čitanja 777 stranica (simboličan broj srpskog izdanja ove knjige) nisam osetio prezasićenje, niti bilo kakvu vrstu ,,umora’’. Pre nego što sam počeo da čitam, čitao sam i gledao razne prikaze, i malo me je uplašila činjenica da više od polovine ljudi nikada ne završi ''Češljugara'', a da ga mnogi od onih koji ga pak završe, čitaju mesecima. To sa mnom nije bio slučaj. Sve je teklo potpuno lagano i neopterećeno, i mogu da kažem da sam prijatno iznenađen i brojnim dijalozima u knjizi.Da li je ovo delo dikensovsko, kako mnogi vole da kažu? Ne znam, jer nisam neki stručnjak za Dikensa, niti sam ga toliko čitao. Međutim, ono što mogu da kažem jeste da, ma koliko dugački Dikensovi romani bili, svaka stranica će biti nabijena radnjom, te je to jedan od razloga zašto ''Velika očekivanja'' volim da nazivam pretečom telenovela (i to u pozitivnom smislu). Kod Done Tart to nije slučaj. ''Češljugar'' nije roman radnje, već roman pojedinca i njegovog unutrašnjeg života, kao i sukoba tog unutrašnjeg života sa spoljašnjim svetom.Tradicija bildungromana je vrlo bogata, i neki od najvećih romana svetske književnosti su upravo bildungromani, a ''Češljugar'' stoji rame uz rame sa njima. Ova ''coming-of-age'' priča nosi univerzalne istine i vrednosti, ali najzahvalnija je i najbogatija zapravo kada se gleda kroz prizmu ne samo književnosti, već i samog postojanja u XXI veku. Put Teodora Dekera neverovatan je od prve do poslednje stranice, i način na koji se on razvija, i koje životne stavove počinje da zastupa usled onoga što mu se događa i sa kim mu se događa, ispričan je perfektno. Jasno je da je moja fasciniranost ovim delom velika, ali zaista mi nije jasno kako neko može da ne saoseća i ne voli Tea, jer je svaki njegov izbor jasno predstavljen, kao možda ne logičan, ali nužan produkt korelacije sa ljudima i svetom koji u datom trenutku reaguju sa njim i protiv njega, a taj upliv naturalizma vrlo je taktičan, i na prvi pogled čak i neosetan.Naravno, tu je i ono zbog čega mi se ''Češljugar'' najviše svideo, a to je simbolika same slike Karela Fabricijusa iz 1654, koja predstavlja epicentar svake eksplozije (sasvim nameran odabir reči) u romanu i lajtmotiv koji održava Tea u životu na više nivoa. Ideja da je život kratak, a umetnost večna starija je i od latinske izreke iz naslova, ali je u ''Češljugaru'' ona predstavljena tako tanano, tako čisto i jasno, da će i najveći ,,nevernik’’ zaista poverovati u floskulu da će umetnost spasiti svet, i da i kad naizgled nema ničeg drugog, čovek uvek može da se raduje umetnosti, i da u njoj traži i pronalazi smisao života.U duhu filozofije poslednjih dvadesetak stranica romana, koje su me i pored svega pogodile novom jačinom, želim da svoju ljubav prema ovom (modernom) klasiku uporedim sa Teovom ljubavlju prema slici koja mu je promenila život, i završim sledećim citatom: ,,...čast je i privilegija voleti ono što Smrt ne dotiče.’’"

Aconteceu-me exatamente o mesmo com Murakami, e os seus “1Q84” (2010) e “Kafka à Beira-mar” (2002). Bons escritores, mas que parecem ter apenas um mundo a oferecer. Talvez o problema nem seja deles, talvez eu espere demasiado, talvez espere algo que a literatura, enquanto arte, não pode dar. Poderá um escritor dar-nos múltiplos mundos distintos? Foi exatamente sobre isto, e por causa deste livro que acabei a escrever, há dias, “Aprender, esquecer e memorizar os cânones culturais”.[image]Capa da versão americana, e o quadro ""The Goldfinch"" (1654) de Carel Fabritius que serve de móbil à trama do livro.Donna Tartt tem um estilo próprio, tem uma voz própria, escreve de forma fluída e lúcida. Fala das emoções sentidas num mundo contemporâneo carregado de deveres morais para com a sociedade. A sua primeira pessoa é instigante, mantém-nos agarrados ao pensar e sentir dos seus personagens, como se estivéssemos todo o tempo dentro das suas cabeças. Mas no final existe um certo vazio, por mais que tudo pareça rebuscar erudição. De certa forma, acontece-me exatamente o mesmo com as obras de Murakami.Veja-se o mundo de Tartt. Em termos temáticos, temos um jovem que se procura, perdido no mundo, sozinho, tentando tornar-se adulto. Sim, também temos a arte, o quadro que está todo o tempo lá, como está a mãe, são ambos aquilo que mantém o jovem ligado ao mundo. A arte surge, ou parece surgir, como o elo que nos pode manter vivos, a beleza que torna o real suportável, e impede de marchar desta vida. Por outro lado, temos droga a rodos, é ela que acaba por verdadeiramente, em ""O Pintassilgo"" nos manter à tona. Em certos momentos questionei-me mesmo se Tartt não percebia mais de farmácia do que de arte. Mas é claramente o mundo particular de Tartt, em que cabe à droga funcionar como motor das pequenas tensões morais, já que simplesmente não existe sexo, como se os seus personagens fossem todos abstinentes. Como Tartt precisa do Yin e do Yang no desenho dos seus personagens, ao criar personagens puros na carne, impurifica-os pela droga. Muito anos 1990, e um claro sinal de falta de evolução no traço da escritora, que se agrava mais, quando em muitos momentos a ""voz"" do personagem principal ecoa completamente o personagem principal de ""A História Secreta"".Julgo que a espécie de vazio que sinto com “O Pintassilgo” advém do facto de já não me encontrar no público alvo. É um livro sobre um jovem que se torna adulto, mas é um adulto contemporâneo, como tal, o seu mundo aos 25 anos, é o típico mundo dos 17. E é para esses que Tartt escreve, mesmo pensando que não o faz. O uso das técnicas de thriller envolvem muito bem o romance psicológico, sustentam e mantêm o leitor agarrado, mas tudo o que vai sendo desvelado sabe a pouco, porque na verdade não existe muito para dar dentro da cabeça de uma criança que sofre um grande trauma e passa o resto dos seus dias a tentar sobreviver emocionalmente. É uma viagem existencial, com todos os dramas da incompreensão, da perda, do amor não correspondido, do só contra todos, que por vezes roça o puro niilismo.Para elevar o discurso, Tartt traz para o centro da discussão três autores e suas obras — Rembrandt, Dostoiévski e Proust — e consegue desta forma levar-nos a submergir, a aceitar muito do que tem para dizer sobre o Belo, a Arte e a Vida. Mas não chega. Não chega construir uma tese e colá-la nas últimas 30 páginas do livro, quando todo o livro parece tão pouco preocupado com essa tese. Acredito que teria sido inebriante, tivesse eu outra idade, aquelas últimas páginas em que tudo parece cozer-se, tudo parece ter sentido, tudo tem um desígnio, mesmo que tudo não o tenha, nem possa ter. Acaba sendo uma fuga existencialista, capaz de criar momentos de leitura apaixonantes, em que as páginas se vão virando sozinhas, criando horas bem preenchidas, mas que no final se arruma na prateleira, para esquecer.Esta leitura serviu-me ainda para colocar em perspetiva o prémio Pulitzer. Cada vez me convenço mais que se deveria ter ficado pela área de eleição do seu fundador, o jornalismo, onde tem servido bastante melhor a sua função.Análise publicada no blog VI: http://virtual-illusion.blogspot.pt/2...."

This was a big book in every sense of the word—big in size (nearly 800 pages), big in adventure and characterization, and big in ideas—about life, love, art, and destiny. While it times it moved a bit slower than I would have liked, it felt smaller (in a good way) and much more accessible than many novels of this size do.Thirteen-year-old Theo Decker had his life change instantly when he survived an accident that killed his mother. With his father's whereabouts unknown and no other family to be found, Theo moves into the palatial Park Avenue apartment home of a distant friend. As he navigates the interesting dynamics of this family, and tries to deal with his overwhelming grief, the one thing he has that makes him continue to feel connected to his mother is her favorite painting, a small, affecting painting by a lesser-known Dutch master.""But sometimes, unexpectedly, grief pounded over me in waves that left me gasping; and when the waves washed back, I found myself looking out over a brackish wreck so illumined in a light so lucid, so heartsick and empty, that I could hardly remember that the world had ever been anything but dead.""In addition to his friend, Andy, Theo's closest companions during his time in New York are antiques expert James ""Hobie"" Hobart, who takes him under his wing and teaches Theo everything he knows about furniture restoration and the appreciation of antiques, and Pippa, a young girl with whom Theo has a powerful and tragic connection. And when Theo's father shows up in New York and moves him to Las Vegas to live with him and his cocktail waitress girlfriend, Xandra, Theo's life changes again.While in Las Vegas, Theo befriends Boris, a troubled underachiever with a passion for money and drugs. Their friendship is intense, and Boris' influence changes Theo in many ways. Both see the other as a refuge from the chaos of their own lives, and as Theo realizes that his father's life isn't as perfect as he's made it seem, Boris helps him cope—mostly with the help of illegal substances.The Goldfinch follows Theo's life into adulthood, with his return to New York, and finding himself constantly facing challenges. He is never truly far away from his grief over his mother's death, or his obsession with the painting, which leads him into the art underworld.""Caring too much for objects can destroy you. Only—if you care for a thing enough, it takes on a life of its own, doesn't it? And isn't the whole point of things—beautiful things—that they connect you to some larger beauty?""Even though his character was tremendously flawed, I loved Theo and was completely immersed in his story. I also found Hobie and Pippa's characters tremendously fascinating, and developed a warmth for the Barbour family as well. Sadly, I wasn't as enamored with Boris' character—I felt that every time he spoke in the book, he spoke for far too long, and Donna Tartt's portrayal of his accent made much of what he said a little hard to follow. I found myself imagining what it might be like to get to know Hobie and Pippa, that's how fascinating I found them.This book tackles some important questions about art and beauty, loss and living up to one's destiny. But beyond that it is about how powerful an anchor grief and guilt can be, and how dramatically the two can change the outcome of one's life. Donna Tartt—author of one of my most favorite books, The Secret History—is a wonderfully enigmatic and captivating storyteller, but I felt as if she crammed a little too much into this book. I honestly could have done without the whole art underworld thread of the plot, and I don't believe it would have affected the book.You may think to yourself, almost 800 pages? Is it worth it? Will I be able to get into the story? I'd say unequivocally, yes, to both of those questions. While not a perfect book, The Goldfinch is one that will leave you thinking long after you've finished it. "

The thing is, I did really enjoy this book. I found the writing to be beautiful but there was just something that held this back from a 5 star rating and I'm gonna spend this review trying to explain what that was. Honestly the writing in this book was amazing and, although I've never read a Pulitzer Prize winner before and have no idea what the criteria for winning is, I can see how deserving The Goldfinch is. There were some amazingly written passages about love, life and grief:""But sometimes, unexpectedly, grief pounded over me in waves that left me gasping; and when the waves washed back, I found myself looking over a brackish wreck which was illumined in a light so lucid, so heartsick and empty, that I could hardly remember that the world had ever been anything but dead.""""...and at some point, deep in the night, when we were climbing on the jungle gym and showers of sparks were flying out of our mouths, I had the epiphany that laughter was light, and light was laughter, and that this was the secret of the universe.""The writing always so perfectly encapsulated what life was like without feeling overly wordy which is the downfall of a lot of other books and honestly quite an achievement. The first half of the book felt very readable; it flowed really well and there was never a part where I was bored. Reading about Theo was so interesting, especially seeing him grieve at such a young age and struggling with such mature issues. These were the parts I enjoyed the most. I liked when he was younger and carefree. I liked when he was mucking around with Boris because I don't care if a bored sixteen year old does drugs with his Russian friend. It was fun to read and provided some really great insight into the characters of the story. However, as the story progressed I found myself disliking Theo more and more. I didn't like that he thought he was better than others and insisted that he wasn't a bad guy despite very obviously doing bad things. I lost patience with him when he was always doing drugs and seedy art dealings without Hobie knowing. I think his crush on Pippa was really odd and inappropriate and felt like creepy infatuation more than anything. These things are probably what dragged this book down to 4 stars for me. I find it very hard to enjoy a book with a protagonist that I find really unlikable. I liked Boris because he was always honest about his intentions.In a similar way to many other people, I found the ending a little disappointing. It kind of just ends. Everything else in the book has been so wonderfully built and the reader gets such an understanding of Theo and his mind and the ending is comparatively brief. I enjoyed some of the 'soul searching' passages towards the end but still believe that more could have been done with the conclusion of such an epic story. If you haven't read this book I still highly recommend it because it is a real feat in fiction and, despite the negative things I have said in this review, I really REALLY enjoyed it. Go pick it up and see what you think!"
293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,Rating 4 out of 5,"I ran across a description of this book that called it a ""literary thriller,"" and I think that is the best description of The Goldfinch. That definitely isn't what I expected when I read the description and learned the book was about an obscure painting! The action starts right away, when Theo is in a museum that is bombed with his mother, and the story revolves around that event and the painting they were examining, following Theo through decades of his life. The Goldfinch is a very readable book, and 771 pages flew by, but I don't think I would ever read it again. It has a similar feeling to The DaVinci Code - short chapters, just enough art detail to get you looking up details, fast paced with a mystery of sorts. The author tries to save it from being pure fluff by having her characters ruminate on love and decision making, but I ended up feeling that those parts were the least successful, kind of crammed in there to get to call the book literary and not just thriller. They are almost poetic, but also out of place. Here's an example - it's beautiful but I still felt like it didn't belong:""That I was so haunted... suggested - ominously- a love more binding than physical affection, some tar-pit of the soul where I might flop around and malinger for years.""The character of Theo is complex - Tartt writes him to be very sympathetic, but he is also a thief, a drug addict, and a liar. I appreciate when an author can make you root for someone who isn't obviously good. There are secondary characters who are equally nuanced, and Tartt doesn't reveal everything about them when you first meet them. This elevated the book to me, better than the soliloquies on life and love.But maybe the author just believes in ""throwing yourself head first and laughing into the holy rage calling your name."" It's all in here!One more comment - I started a Donna Tartt book, The Little Friend, in one of my speed-dating piles last year. I haven't gone back to it yet but if it's anything like The Goldfinch, I should be able to get through it in no time.

This book reminds me of a “Life, Interrupted” story. Thirteen-year-old Theo Decker survives a bombing that kills his mother. Up until then he had lived a normal life with a loving mother, but then his life was derailed. This story is about so many things, love, loss, friendship, making choices, forgiveness, art, antiques, etc. I could go on and on and the author discusses all of them in great length.I own both the print and audio version of this book. I put off reading it for quite some time, not because it is a big book but because I had read the reviews and I was scared. Scared because this type of novel was out of my comfort zone. Scared that this was going to be too dark and gritty for me. Scared that because although I’m smart, I’m not intellectual enough to truly appreciate the uniqueness of what I sensed this story was going to be. I chose the audiobook which was the right choice for me because I could just sit back and soak in the eloquent writing of the author.I won’t mention any more of the plot, you can read the book description or other reviews. I will tell you that this is a big book, but I love big books. I never felt the story dragged, there was always something interesting to ponder. Many times, I couldn’t decide if I wanted to hug Theo or slap him. His choices and inability to speak up made me crazy. Emotionally, I was drained by the time this mad ride was over, but I didn’t want it to end. That’s the sign of a great story!"

Maledetta..! Ogni volta mi faccio un idea sbagliata e solo alla fine capisco quanto sia brava e mi sorprende sempre, quindi che dire? Dopo 892 pagine mi sento un po' travolta, mi sorprende come nessuno lo abbia paragonato al Ritratto di Doria Gray di Wilde, entrambi girano attorno agli stessi due protagonisti: uno bello e dannato, perduto e amante della bellezza e l'altro un quadro, che sarà ""il cardine del destino"" in entrambe le storie. Ecco, volendo essere pignoli la trama c'è, lo stile c'è, il significato c'è...però 892 pagine?veramente? Era proprio necessario...? Qualche taglietto in più non guastava secondo me.Alla fin fine voglio consigliarlo a tutti, perché merita, anche solo per leggere le ultime pagine di una bellezza disarmante, questo libro vi farà riflettere..sulla vita e sulla morte, sul destino, sul bene e sul male, sull'amore, sulla magia e sulla bellezza. E tanto per stare in tema con il libro..forse il fatto che sia stato proprio lui ad accompagnarmi alla fine dell'anno ormai vecchio e all'inizio di quello nuovo non sia stato casuale?

Personal opinion: good book, interesting story, not surprised someone made it into a film with the highly visual descriptions and many made-for-screen scenes, but WAY too much talk about drugs and addiction for my taste, therefore making the book excessively long. Yes, Donna Tartt can write, no doubt about it, but by the time I got to the end, I was ready to move on to something less angst-ridden. Interesting that the artist Fabritius and his Goldfinch painting were real. And after checking out online who was cast in what parts for the movie, I’m further intrigued. Glad it’s finally off my TBR list.*Note: Saw the movie version last night. As expected, given the book’s length and the need to edit it down for a 2-hour film, it was a bit of a mess, with a lot of background and character development sacrificed. If I hadn’t read the unabridged version first, it might have been difficult to follow, or at least to appreciate what all the hoopla about the book was about."

September, die Verzweiflung des Waisenkindes an Dickens (auch der Dickens-beeinflusste Harry Potter dient als Spitzname für die Hauptfigur); der schwierige Umgang mit dem Tod eines Elternteils an Jonathan Safran Foers „Extrem laut und unglaublich nah“. Wunderbar auch die Schilderungen in der Werkstatt des Antiquitätenladens und eindrücklich die Alkohol- und Drogenkarierre von Theo Decker. Es kommt gerade im letzten Teil des Romans zunehmend zu unerwarteten Wendungen und am Ende zieht die Hauptfigur eine düstere Sicht auf das Leben, die Unmöglichkeit zwischen Gut und Böse zu unterscheiden und die Folgen des eigenen Tuns abzuschätzen, aber er liefert auch eine Liebeserklärung an die Kunst, deren Schönheit, deren Fähigkeit Menschen über die Zeiten hinweg zu verbinden."

His wealthy friend's family accommodate him for a while but then it was time for him to leave. And then begins Theo's story, of art, history, philosophy, heroin, drug dealers, thugs and what not.Since the time this book came out, it has been dominating for more than 5 years and no book has come close to that, and I have absolutely no idea why. Donna Tartt fans, don't hate me for it, but this is the second time I am disappointed, first being The Secret History. If I am reading a book that has 771 pages or more, I do not expect overwriting, over explaining every damn thing and pretentiousness, I want a character that is not so self absorbed and vain, i want likeable characters, and a plot that is not scattered everywhere."

I do have to say that at first I was not liking the book at all, there were some points where I was like “am I reading about a painting or how to make a wood desk?”. There was one point where I really thought I couldn’t finish it, but thankfully I did. The ending was what I think surprised me the most, how beautifully it is written (I underlined probably almost every single sentence) and how amazing Donna describes such important aspects of life in a really simple way but you can still feel those words deep inside of you. Overall it was a life-changing book, at least for me, but as I said once before: be patient, the more you read, the better it gets."

Η Καρδερίνα είναι το πιο πρόσφατο της και η κινηματογραφική μεταφορά του βρίσκεται στις οθόνες του σινεμά. Ήθελα χρόνια να πιάσω κάτι δικό της χωρίς όμως να καίγομαι γιαυτό ιδιαίτερα, μέχρι που μια μέρα έπεσα πάνω στο τρέιλερ της ταινία. Που ήταν τόσο καλαίσθητο και ατμοσφαιρικό που με μάγεψε και κατευθείαν το βιβλίο ανέβηκε από το πάτο της λίστας στην κορυφή.Τώρα η ιστορία ακολουθεί τον δεκατριάχρονο Θίο που ζει με την μητέρα του στην πανέμορφη Νέα Υόρκη. Μια μέρα σε μια συνηθισμένη τους βόλτα επισκέπτονται το μητροπολιτικό μουσείο της πόλης όπου μετά από μια έκρηξη βόμβας πολλές ζωές θα χαθούν και μέσα σε αυτές, η πολύ αγαπημένη του μητέρα. Μετά το τραγικό αυτό γεγονός ο Θίο θα αναγκαστεί να μείνει στο σπίτι ενός παλιού και πλούσιο φίλου του σε μια οικογένεια που νιώθει ότι προσπαθεί να τον αγκαλιάσει χωρίς κατά βάθος να μπορεί και τότε θα εμφανιστεί ο αλκοολικός και εξαφανισμένος του πατέρας για να τον πάρει μαζί του στο Λας Βέγκας, σε μια ζωή που θα είναι η αρχή της καταστροφή του. Σε όλα αυτά έχει κάτι που του δίνει δύναμη και παρηγοριά και του θυμίζει την ζωή πριν το συμβάν είναι ένας πίνακας με το τίτλο ""Η Καρδερίνα"" που έκλεψε από το μουσείο μετά την καταστροφή. Η καρδερίνα είναι ένα βιβλίο που μιλάει για την απώλεια και το πως την αντιμετωπίζει ο κάθε άνθρωπος διαφορετικά. Αν και μεγάλο σε έκταση κοντά στις 1.000 σελίδες, και δεν σας κρύβω ότι στην αρχή ένιωσα ότι οδεύω προς μια απογοητευτική ανάγνωση. Οι πρώτες 200 σελίδες ήταν υπερβολικά περιγραφικές (Παράδειγμα: Υπάρχουν ολόκληρες σελίδες γεμάτες όπου ο Θίο μας μιλάει για το μουσείο και στην κυριολεξία περιγράφει κάθε μικρή σπιθαμή του) Και ενώ το γράψιμο ήταν μαγικό και σε έκανε να νιώθεις ότι τα βλέπεις όλα αυτά μπροστά σου, ταυτόχρονα με κούραζε. Όσο όμως προχωρούσα και ίσως συνήθιζα την λεπτομερή πένα της Donna Tartt, ή ίσως ότι μπαίναμε πιο βαθιά στην ιστορία και ζούσαμε πιο έντονα τα συναισθήματα του πρωταγωνιστή μας, όλο και περισσότερο το αγαπούσα. Το κομμάτι του Λας Βέγκας και η φιλία του Θίο με τον Μπόρις είναι με μεγάλη διαφορά το αγαπημένο μου. Το διάβασα μέσα σε μια μέρα μονορούφι! Για τον χαρακτήρα του Θίο τώρα, είχα διαβάσει χίλια δυο άσχημα σχόλια. Προσωπικά θεωρώ πως είναι αδικημένος και αυτό γιατί του συμβαίνουν σοβαρά πράγματα σε μια πολύ τρυφερή ηλικία. Μας αρέσει δεν μας αρέσει, ακριβώς τότε διαμορφώνουμε ένα πιο καθοριστικό χαρακτήρα. Ναι μεν μεγαλώνοντας ωριμάζουμε, μαθαίνουμε, αλλά έχουμε ήδη φτιάξει την βάση μας. Μπορούσα να καταλάβω γιατί τον είχε πάρει από κάτω και του πήρε 900 σελίδες να σηκωθεί, γιατί ζούσε σε ένα μόνιμο άγχος και την απόλυτη μιζέρια, γιατί δεν είχε πίστη στον εαυτό του. Και εκεί ήταν που ερχόταν ο απόλυτος συνδυασμός και έκαναν ένα τέλειο δίδυμο με τον Μπόρις, που πιθανότατα θα είχε πολύ περισσότερο ενδιαφέρον αν το βιβλίο ήταν γραμμένο από την πλευρά του μιας και ήταν το άκρως αντίθετο του Θίο. Ναι μεν ήταν αυτό που λέμε σε απλή γλώσσα ""κωλόπαιδο"", αλλά ήταν και δυναμικός και ειλικρινής με τον εαυτό του, ήξερε ποιος ήταν και μέχρι που μπορούσε να φτάσει. Από τους υπόλοιπους χαρακτήρες ξεχώρισα τον Χόμπι φυσικά, που έδινε μια νότα πιο ευαίσθητη και λογική! Γενικά όμως η Donna Tartt δεν προσπαθεί να φτιάξει συμπαθητικούς χαρακτήρες! Ειδικά ο Θίο και ο Μπόρις είναι ο ορισμός του αντι-ήρωα και στο τέλος αυτήν είναι η μαγεία όλου του βιβλίου. Δεν θα μπω σε περισσότερες λεπτομέρειες. Πιστεύω πως όσο λιγότερα ξέρεις τόσο πιο πολύ θα το απολαύσεις. Οι περιγραφές θα σας κάνουν να νιώσετε ότι είστε και οι ίδιοι στα στενά σοκάκια της Νέας Υόρκης ή στο καυτό χαώδης Λας Βέγκας. Οι χαρακτήρες θα ζωντανέψουν και θα σας μεταφέρουν στα σκοτεινά μέρη του μυαλού. Μην φοβηθείτε τον όγκο του (που σίγουρα υπάρχουν σημεία που ίσως σας κουράσουν) αλλά κυλάει πολύ πιο εύκολα και όμορφα από όσο θα φανταστείτε ποτέ. Η Καρδερίνα είναι από αυτά τα βιβλία που ακόμα και αν δεν το αγαπήσετε θα σας χαρίσει κάτι με την ανάγνωση του. Προσωπικά θα μου λείψει η τόσο όμορφη γραφή της Donna Tartt και η παρέα του Θίο. Οπότε επόμενος σταθμός το σινεμά για να δω την ταινία! Καποιες φορές θέλουμε αυτό που θέλουμε ακόμα κι αν ξέρουμε ότι θα μας σκοτώσει. Δεν μπορούμε να ξεφύγουμε από αυτό που είμαστε."

За мене ће то увек бити врло необично и задивиљујуће, јер заиста треба имати посебан таленат и уложити огроман труд како би се поставили у кожу супротног пола. Овакве књиге управо потврђују ту теорију да свако ко пише, свако ко жели да пише квалитетно, мора у себи да садржи и мушке и женске црте личности, изражене у подједнакој мери или са сменом доминације.Друга ствар која ме је освојила је дужина ове књиге и њена непрекидна пуноћа кроз све 864 стране. Многи се жале да је непотребно дугачка, да треба избацити неке делове, али мени је управо таква савршена. Да је мршавија, осећала бих се ускраћено, не бих имала прилику да упијам те прелепе описе и реченице које саме по себи представљају једно мини уметничко дело. Осим што су дивни, описи су и врло реални - комбинација која се тешко постиже. Безбројне ситуације у којима су ликови конзумирали опојна средства су једне од тих, толико су стварно описане да осећај мамурности, мучнине, депресије и погубљености прелази и на читаоца.Колико сам мрзела ликове у ,,Тајној историји"", код ових овде не могу а да их не волим и поред свих њихових мана и грехова. Најразнобојнији ми је Борис, ходајућа невоља, забава и дубина коју не знате да ли да држите крај себе или побегнете што даље од ње. Свакако, сви остали (осим господина и госпође из Вегаса) су ми много драги и свако од њих зрачи неком топлином и ушушканошћу.Када би ме неко питао да му објасним о чему је ова књига, рекла бих му/јој да је о свему, али буквално о свему - о уметности, љубави, пријатељству, лажи, истини, надахнућу, зависности, менталним болестима, породици, времену, историји, храбрости, слабости, променама, опсесији, (не)моралности, криминалу, издаји, туги, срећи, покајању, свету, смрти, животу и што је најважније: о бесмртности."

Повествованието е увлекателно, темата, свързана с изчезнало произведение на изкувството от Нидерландския златен век е перфектно представена и ми беше безкрайно интересна, а и по-голяма част от действието се развива в любимия ми Ню Йорк. Прозата на Дона Тарт е добре опитомена, за тези почти 1000 страници не усетих миг досада или отегчение, дори напротив, прехвърлях страниците все по-увълчено. Харесаха ми амплитудите в характера на главния персонаж и контрастът на преживяванията му в различните социални обстановки, в които беше поставен — непрекъснатото разпиляване и събиране на душевните му терзания. Напоследък все по-привлекателни ми се струват литературни герои с очертани в детайли несъвършенства, затова останах много доволна, че Тио Декър е точно такъв.

Knygoje sutelpa tiek daug visko - nuostabi kalba (išties meistriškas Andriaus Patiomkino vertimas), veikėjai, kuriems spėji pajausti pilną spektrą emocijų ir istorija, laviruojanti tarp dienoraščio, detektyvo, meilės romano, komedijos ir tragedijos. Skaitant beveik 900 puslapių ilgio knygą, Donnai Tartt meistriškai užliūliuojant pasakiško grožio kalba, retkarčiais pamiršti, kad didžiąją laiko dalį laiko iš tiesų mažai kas vyksta, o kai jau vyksta, autorė, rodos, bando atsigriebti už visą laikotarpį, kuomet vyko per mažai ar nevyko visai. Veiksmo pliūpsnius seka apmąstymų ir filosofavimų lavinos, su stiproku grafomanijos prieskoniu, nekantresniam galinčios sukelti savaime suprantamą nepasitenkinimą, kurio neišvengiau ir pati. Istorija seka Teodorą Dekerį nuo jo gyvenimą pakeitusios katastrofos, kuomet trylikametis praranda mamą siaubingomis aplinkybėmis ir lieka Pasaulyje bene vienas, įsikibęs tik mėgstamiausio mamos paveikslo, kurį įvykių sūkuryje neapgalvotai pasisavina ir kuris jam atstoja gelbėjimosi liemenę gyvenimo vandenyne. Sunkiomis akimirkomis, Teodorui mėtantis iš vienų namų į kitus, išgyvenant vieną sudėtingesnių paauglystės variantų, suvokiant kad jokie ""tikri"" jo giminaičiai iš tiesų nedega noru jo auginti, iš sudėtingo paauglio virstant dar sudėtingesniu suaugusiuoju, ""Dagilio"" paveikslas tampa didžiausia Teodoro kankyne ir maloniausia paslaptimi, kurią turėdama jaučiasi kiek ypatingesnis nei visi kiti ir, rodos, tik dėl to sugeba išlaikyti galvą virš vandens. Knyga turi gausybę privalumų. Ji parašyta su tokia meile ir talentu, joje telpa tiek daug visko - įdomi istorija, pluoštas socialinių problemų ir neįkyri jų analizė, spalvingi, skirtingi veikėjai. Vis dėlto, didžiąją dalį veikėjų mėgti velniškai sudėtinga, o jų priimami sprendimai kamuoja visos knygos metu. Kamuoja juos ir aplinkinius, o kartu kamuoja ir skaitantįjį - knyga persmelkta nerimu ir skausmu, baime ir nusivylimais. Nors vietomis autorė sugeba prajuokinti, net ir juokas nervingas, greitas, laukiant to, kas išnirs iš už kampo, nes patirtis rodo, kad nesvarbu, kas ten slepiasi - malonu nebus. Siužeto posūkiai retkarčiais atrodo nuleisti iš dangaus, o nepaisant knygos apimties, labai daug klausimų apie veikėjų motyvacijas, gana svarbias siužeto tėkmei, lieka kabėti ore - neatsakyti ir retkarčiais, rodos, net neapsvarstyti, kas erzina, turint omenyje tai, jog Tartt bent pusšimtį puslapių paskiria baldų restauracijos niuansams. Ir nors galiu teigti, kad pirmąja pažintimi su D.Tartt ir laiku su ""Dagiliu"" ran..

I could say a bit more about this turn of events but I won't now, except to note that in a desperate bid for social contact with other mothers I've decided to join a book club, despite the fact that I've always hated book clubs and everything they connote, up to and including talking about books.Anyway, the book I'm supposed to read for this book club is The Goldfinch, and so far I FUCKING HATE IT. I'm about a hundred pages in and my jaw's just dropping progressively lower with each word as I continue reminding myself not just that this thing won the Pulitzer, but that -- far more important -- pretty much all of my booksters who read it liked, or even loved it, at least up to the end. But I just find the whole thing so incredibly dull that it really does hurt me to read. The main character is just as boring and cardboard as all the other boring cardboard characters, the language is predictable and uninteresting and everything takes at least five times longer than it should, which I actually like normally -- I love bloated, endless books! -- except that I'm so bored by all the filler that it's very frustrating to plough through. There is also just all this completely stupid stuff, like a parenthetical aside about how much their housekeeper loved them so she offered to work for free when they couldn't afford to pay her, where I'm just like, ""What?"" I mean, is this dreck setting up for something interesting and Gone-Girly later, and if it is will I need to wade through three hundred pages to get there? (""Trying to stop thinking about it was like trying to stop thinking of a purple cow. The purple cow was all you could think of."" Ugh!) It reminds me of a lot of kids' chapter books in having such a bland narrator that he could really be anyone, which would be okay if this were plot-driven fiction that didn't take thirty pages for anything at all to advance in the plot.All this is to say: if I can't stand this book so far, is it going to get better? If you read this and liked it, did you feel it took awhile to get going, or would you say if I hate it now I might as well just give up? My lonely desperation is the only thing driving me at this point. It's hard to find other people in Miami who like to read, but on the other hand I myself am liking to read less and less the more time I spend with The Goldfinch... ButI know that most people loved this book and I want to love it too! It does make me nervous though that a lot of reviewers say they liked it up until the end. If I hate the beginning should I bother with the rest?Signed,Stay-at-home Mom in Miami"

314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/808994-doug-bradshaw,Rating 4 out of 5,"Rip into the book and read through it quickly, slowing down sometimes to enjoy the gold nuggets of wisdom and insight that are buried here and there. It must be partially Donna’s philosophy of life, existentialistic views of how bad things happen to good people and occasionally, good things happen to bad folk and wonder if there is or isn’t a God making or allowing all of these things to happen. Look carefully at the 450 year old masterpiece, the beloved Goldfinch, its beauty speaking to us through the centuries, and then take another look at it to realize it is also a symbol of despair and how difficult life is. During the romp, watch a 14 year old boy, Theo, floundering and experimenting with love and friendship, drugs and alcohol, sometimes suicidal, trying to bond with his alcoholic, gambling father and shallow Vegas working step mother, at the same time learning about friendship and some of life’s seedier things from an intelligent and lost Russian friend, Boris, who is a 15 year old mini adult. All the while, Theo is secretly hiding the priceless masterpiece, a freak occurrence having put the work of art illegally into his hands. Will Theo become a functioning adult, does he get through the drug and alcohol phase of his youth and move successfully into adulthood, will he have any kind of meaningful moral code, successful relationships with women, a meaningful career, a good life? The story is fast paced, generally exciting, sometimes lugubrious, but it is worth the read. I think it could be edited into a five star read. When I say edited, I'm referring to cutting out some of the detailed long passages about minutia that didn't always add much for me. The core story is very interesting and thought provoking and it has a very relevant and interesting message"

It's hard to say all the good things I want to about this book. The raw emotion in the sentences is so powerful. The characters are etched in my mind very powerfully. By reading it during my Karakoram-Himalaya's trip, I can more feel some long-unwonted sense of beauty and tranquillity, some softening influence awakened by its peace. And they moved faintly in my mind.There are some books that influence you along the way and enrich your understanding of the human race. These kind of books are the one where the readers evolve along with the protagonist and find themselves changing with every page they turn. The Goldfinch is one of these books.

Това лят�� препрочитах ""Война и мир"" и потвърждавам: Дона Тарт се чете като класика. Това разточително отношение към детайла - на душевни състояния, на вещи, на истории, което съвременните писатели вече не си позволяват. Дона си го позволява и й се получават едни пищни, спиращи дъха описания, усещането, че надничаш право в нечия душа, че влизаш в кожата на човек, когото не си могъл да разбереш. Рядко, но ми се случваше да усетя по-голяма бъбривост, точно както ми се случва и при класиците. Като цяло, много силна книга. Книга, която ще остане."

Eso sí, la cantidad de detalle que tiene hace que no sea recomendable para todo el mundo. Sin embargo, para mí, la definición del arte que presenta y la relación permanente de esta con el protagonista son oro puro.

325,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26480778-phee,Rating 4 out of 5,"Okay so I've now read all three of Donna Tartt's novels. I'm sure that some of you would be interested to know what I think after reading all three. As per popular opinion, I absolutely love The Secret History and I think that if you were going to try any of her work, then that's the one to go for. As for the Little Friend... I really disliked it. In fact I'm still stewing over it now. Nothing wrong with the style, plot or writing. What I don't like is the lack of resolution. It's not imperative for me to have a book that gives me all the answers and I like obscure. But it didn't work for that book, not for me anyway. So where does this massive book fall in terms of her other work? Well, slap bang in the middle actually. Having read all her books, I can safely say that Donna Tartt's writing is superb. Each of her novels are very different and yet she makes an impressive show of her talents with each turn of the page. I will say that I think that her writing is also very accessible and easy to read, whilst still containing layer upon layer of intrigue and wonder. Honestly I'm quite smitten with it. The only drawback that I find with her writing is that it's slow pace and high page count often mean that book feels like it's dragging you along. I also wish that there were a clear way to see the passage of time. We spend ages with Theo at certain stages of his life but there are some sections of the book where it took me while to realise that sometimes years had passed. I think that this confusion really wasn't necessary and it wouldn't have been difficult to add a few dates in here and there. Not a big issue really but definitely something that bugged me. So this is a very character driven story. Ultimately it felt to me that the plot was only really present when Theo impacted on it. It was sort of lurking in the background all the time, like smoke in the air after a fire. It was always Theo's actions or inactions that made the story progress. All the other time in the novel was exploring a lot of different battles going on in Theo's life. Right off the bat he is a troubled soul. Suffering major trauma early in his life with the museum incident. This book is a perfect example of how one event can shape and change your entire life. I love these kinds of stories. Theo often questions whether if he had acted differently on that fateful day, the outcome could have been different. The thought is pointless because he can't do anything to change it now. But consuming and fascinating nonetheless. It's also a representation of how debilitating PTSD is and can be on someone's life.The supporting cast of side characters were fascinating. Every character stood out as unique and different. I had no trouble imagining the variety of class and culture on display. Everyone felt real. They could be stood right in front of me and I would recognise them. The locales were also very well written. Though I didn't like the segment set in Vegas, it was important to the story and I can see why it was written. Theo's life kind of goes a bit stale there I feel. Obviously Boris adds some life and colour to it, but I couldn't help but feel claustrophobic during the time in the desert. Odd because of how open and empty the residential location was. New York was my favourite location. But I have a strange fondness of city life. I want to address something that featured in one of my progress updates for this book. I mentioned that there was a lot of drug taking and boy was there. I'm not one for trigger warnings or things like that. But the descriptions and sheer number of times that drugs are taken or spoken about is verging on the ridiculous if I'm quite honest. Now I'm no prude, nor am I particularly sensitive to the darker side of things. I don't expect characters to all be goody two shoes (in fact the damaged, broken ones are my favourite). But I did feel like all too often the drugs were the forefront. I mean I get that Theo is very unwell. He's an addict in so many different ways. Not just to drugs and alcohol but to certain people, certain moods and thoughts. He's addicted to pain and he is addicted to dire situations. But I do think that the drug taking scenes were on the side of too many. His addiction was a more important plot point to me than the actual consumption of the drugs. Does that make sense?The art descriptions and the discussions on the worth of material things was so interesting. I'm not an avid lover of art as such. Not in a paintings sense anyway. But I can appreciate it and I have been to quite a few museums and art galleries. The furniture shop was fascinating to me though. What I'd give to go into Hobie's workshop! It made me very reminiscent of The Recognitions by William Gaddis. A book about art, forgery and the worth of it all. I hope that all made sense. I hope Donna Tartt brings out more books in the future. She definitely a must buy author for me now and I'm so happy I've gotten to experience her books. I'm glad that I enjoyed this one as The Little Friend made me waver over this for some time. I was hesitant to pick it up after loving one book but disliking another. It just shows you can still love an author's work without enjoying every piece."
326,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47736596-massimiliano,Rating 5 out of 5,"Uno dei libri più lunghi letti nell'anno, ma ne è valsa decisamente la pena.La facilità di lettura e la scorrevolezza sono quelli di un thriller, e ciononostante questo è un romanzo a pieno titolo contenente di tutto.Le peripezie di Theo Decker - per essere realistiche ci sono forse troppi morti, ma vabbè, d'altra parte parliamo di fiction - lo portano a vagabondare per New York, Las Vegas ed Amsterdam, sempre in cerca della propria identità.Donna Tartt scrive benissimo ed è in grado di alternare momenti estremamente tristi ad altri incredibilmente felici, il tutto con una prosa ed una liricità che a stento si trovano altrove.Se a tutto ciò aggiungiamo un bagaglio culturale ricchissimo tra arte, letteratura e storia, credo ci si possa avvicinare senza dubbi al titolo di ""uno dei migliori romanzi degli anni '10""."
327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7734134-nastassja,Rating 4 out of 5,"Actual rating: 4.5 stars“You can look at a picture for a week and never think of it again. You can also look at a picture for a second and think of it all your life.” The Goldfinch is that picture for me. I looked at it only once and it birthed a swarm of emotions and thoughts inside of me. Donna Tartt is akin to modern Dostoevsky to me. Her philosophy is brutal but honest. Every time I go into her book I expect something fictional, having little to do with real life, something of a more ephemeral quality, and every time she hits me with realism by pushing me out of my comfort zone. Tartt's characters are always morally ambiguous, always searching for the higher purpose, but often faced with self-deceit of great expectations. Unlike The Secret History that deals with the question of morality under the lens of privilege and permissiveness, The Goldfinch is more subtle when it comes to showing its face. It is as if Donna Tartt wanted her readers to get attached to the book and then suffer as victims of Stockholm Syndrome. She deliberately makes us doubt our belief in good and evil, counterpointing that good does not always results in good, and bad actions could lead to a good outcome. A rather daring statement. But Tartt goes further and proves her point by showing her readers what exactly she means by her thesis. And I must confess it's a fascinating game to watch. I found myself torn between loving and hating Tartt's characters, but at the end of the day, I was surprised to admit I related with them more than I could've imagined at first. I believe it's the magic of the Goldfinch - the closeness readers have with the narrative, unlike The Secret History's one, where I was just a passerby witnessing a demoralization of the characters. Plus the alluring part of the Goldfinch is the ending that gives more hope in people, unlike The Secret History which practically condemns its characters.What if all your actions and choices, good or bad, make no difference to God? What if the pattern is pre-set? No no—hang on—this is a question worth struggling with. What if our badness and mistakes are the very thing that set our fate and bring us round to good? What if, for some of us, we can’t get there any other way?”  The Goldfinch is the story of a young boy Theodor Decker who faces tragedy at a rather young age and finds himself adrift in the world of adults - a rather cruel and unprincipled world. His only consolation is the picture of a famous 16th-century painter - The Goldfinch. Only with that picture, Theo finds himself grounded, but it is also the trigger that leads Theo into the world of underground art. Even at the beginning of the book, Donna Tartt plays her cards by foreshadowing future events with a kind of doom: the readers are informed that something bad had happened and we are here to understand how it had happened and why. This method is similar to the one Daphne du Maurier uses in her Rebecca, but it is in no way diminishes the efficiency of that literary device. For a blasé reader like myself, it works as a good start-push of my senses: I am alert and ready. Symbolism also plays a great part in the book: The Goldfinch is the symbol of Theo's mother's love whom he lost at a young age. The picture of the chained but defiant little bird who also, in a way, reminds us of Theo. Theo who, in a way, chained to the memory the picture gives him. The memory and chains that consequently lead Theo to ruin. It's a circle with no beginning and no end. “A great sorrow, and one that I am only beginning to understand: we don’t get to choose our own hearts. We can’t make ourselves want what’s good for us or what’s good for other people. We don’t get to choose the people we are.” The versatility of Tartt's talent is astonishing: she can easily write about Greek literature and then, with the same ease, turn to the topic of art. I always find it a great deal of delight (even though a torturous one) to read her books, opening new topics and boundaries for me to explore. I honestly could write ten more essay pages about the Goldfinch, its symbolism, its characters, its culture ect. It's a vast field of literary genius to explore. But I am afraid it will turn this review into a very boring essay, which we don't want to happen if only for the reason that reading The Goldfinch is an experience worthy of its 700 pages, and every reader will definitely find a lot of meanings for themselves. I am sure the Goldfinch is a new classic that once you've looked at, you will remember forever."
