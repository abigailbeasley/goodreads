The Written Review
ah. ifinally understand.it's not the wordsthat matter,but the spacesbetween.
-a slightly sarcastic review - 
I'm not normally a poetry person and this book did nothing to convince me otherwise.This whole book felt like those instagram quotes minus the inspirational photograph. Does that even count? I admit I'm no expert, but the words seemed more poetical than poem. Like the author took a really pretty sentence and then hit enter a lot.Also, maybe I'm a hypocrite here (just based on the sheer amount of books in my house) but I kind of felt bad for all the unused page space in this book. There's barely a handful of words per page and just vast amounts of white paper. It just felt a bit wasteful.Overall - it was...an experience. Not the best experience, but an experience nonetheless.
- a final poem -
the above reviewwas far moresarcastic than myearlier poem.but this oneis more vulgar.poop.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson,Rating 2 out of 5,"2/7/2017I get likes on this review daily and for a long time i've felt like a 3-star review was too generous so I lowered it to 2 today, which is more accurate in hindsight.7/11/2016If I could sum up my thoughts about this book, it would just be, ""Oh.""Honestly, very underwhelming. I'm not sure why people go crazy about this book and say it's gorgeous and it's their favorite book, because honestly, it's very plain. Some poems are just basic sentences with random skips that have no real point, they aren't too lyrical, and it's literally just like reading a normal sentence. I expected I would love every page of this, but I only marked 4 poems. This just was nothing new. The concepts in this poem, especially when it rolled around to the feminism aspects, just didn't wow me. An entire poem just about ""you don't NEED a man you WANT a man"" was just a repeat of things I've been hearing for years. It wasn't interesting, and a lot of the poems just sounded so pretentious because it was just plain text with no punctuation and random skips in the lines being fed to the reader as art. Someone mentioned this was a little too ""Tumblr,"" and I agree. It was a quick read, but just a little bit frustrating because it was too simple, too familiar. The art was nice and a few of the poems were well-written, but for the most part, it seems like very little effort was put into this, which makes me sad because that's such a mean criticism for an artist who puts so much emotion into her work."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114413220-sofia,Rating 1 out of 5,"*laughs awkwardly* That just happened. If I had known I could write a bestselling book of poetry by putting random thoughts on blank paper and making them look ~pretty,~ I would be a millionaire by now. i don't understandthe point of breaking sentencesup like thisfor the sakeof wasting paperand my timeThere. Was that poetry? Apparently. Milk and Honey is supposed to be inspiring and feminist. At least, that's what I read in the synopsis. I picked it up because of the memes, but whatever. It wasn't inspiring, and it wasn't meme-worthy either. _i brought you ice creambut you werelactose intolerant -sofia_I think the most intriguing part of this book was actually the art, not the poetry. But the drawings by themselves are just fine, and the poetry by itself is just okay, and together they're pretty mediocre. But still. It's food for thought, I guess. _you gave mean appleand i threw itat your face- sofia_Overall, I thought this was a really gimmicky book of poems. It was just an ""artistic way"" of scribbling that I felt was contrived instead of beautiful. _i stayed at a bed and breakfastthe room had no bedbut they stillbrought me an egg- sofia"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19285053-jessie,Rating 1 out of 5,"I read this in a bookshop. I wanted to give it zero stars. It's not poetry. It's shamefully derivitive and doesn't employ any poetic devices except for the most cliched - and not to positive effect. Random line breaks and sentence fragments are used because it is what is expected of a poem, but the author doesn't seem to understand that in poetry, these serve a purpose and must contribute to the poem's larger meaning. The allusions and metaphors are misplaced and nonsensical. ""Milk and honey"" is a phrase that has been used for hundreds if not thousands of years: there is nothing new or interesting or creative or poetic in this book. It reads like a 13 year old's diary. This book is for people who have never read poetry outside of school, and that's too bad. I feel sorry for them because they are missing out. "
4,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"While Rupi Kaur seems very passionate and while I agree with her politics, content, and message, that doesn't make this writing very good. Some of the poems are excellent and will draw you in, but mainly, they are very overrated in terms of pure quality. I see why her poems are popular, but not why she's considered a 'great' or 'brilliant' writer. She's addressing universal themes, but she doesn't do so in an especially artful/skilled way. I'd say if you aren't a big fan of poetry, this book could get you interested in it, but if you're expecting just plain good old-fashioned literary talent, you won't find it here."

9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6536286-ariel,Rating 4 out of 5,"2016 was a year of poetry for me. I read more poetry than I ever have before, I wrote more poetry than I knew I was capable of, and I even started performing poetry. Milk and Honey was one of the catalysts for this, written by an author from a town near me, of very similar age to me, powerful and raw, I enjoyed flipping through this and connecting to the poems and illustrations. I like that she shares her poetry online, that a huge part of why they're successful is because of how sharable they are. I like that they were about abuse and healing, but also about love and self love. I see this book as a great inspiration, I see Rupi Kaur as a great inspiration, and I'm glad it was a big part of my thoughts in 2016.This was me after performing at an event in Brampton, Ontario on April 11th, 2016 with Rupi Kaur!"
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,Rating 5 out of 5,"milk and honey tore through my analytical mind and burrowed deep into my ultra-sensitive soul. It slayed all my emotions, my feminist desires, and my love for vulnerable writing. I may not know a lot about poetry, but I do know a decent amount about feelings, and Rupi Kaur brought all my feelings tumbling out with this gorgeous collection of poems. She writes about love and loss, trauma, and femininity - subjects that I so happen to adore. In spare yet thorough language, she addresses what it feels like to be broken, to be loved, and to be stronger on one's own. This collection, while in many ways simple, addresses some of the darkest and most hopeful matters of the human heart. If you enjoy marinating in your feelings or if you often ponder topics like female empowerment, getting over heartbreak, or what it means to love, I would recommend you check out milk and honey asap. Now I will include three of my favorite poems, though I wish I could include them all.On calling women pretty:""i want to apologize to all the womeni have called prettybefore i've called them intelligent or bravei am sorry i made it sound as thoughsomething as simple as what you're born withis the most you have to be proud of when yourspirit has crushed mountainsfrom now on i will say things likeyou are resilient or you are extraordinarynot because i don't think you're prettybut because you are so much more than that""On co-dependency:""you are in the habitof co-dependingon people tomake up for whatyou think you lackwho tricked youinto believinganother personwas meant to complete youwhen the most they can do is complement""On what is most important:""most importantly lovelike it's the only thing you know howat the end of the day all thismeans nothingthis pagewhere you're sittingyour degreeyour jobthe moneynothing even mattersexcept love and human connectionwho you lovedand how deeply you loved themhow you touched the people around youand how much you gave them"""
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23381142-natalie,Rating 4 out of 5,"milk and honey is a collection of poetry and prose about survival. About the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. It is split into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. It’s difficult trying to review this because every poem is extremely personal, tender and exquisite in its own way.So I decided to feature some of my favorite ones:“you tell me to quiet down causemy opinions make me less beautifulbut i was not made with a fire in my bellyso i could be put outi was not made with a lightness on my tongueso i could be easy to swallowi was made heavyhalf blade and half silkdifficult to forget and not easyfor the mind to follow���“i struggle so deeplyto understandhow someone canpour their entire soulblood and energyinto someonewithout wantinganything inreturn- i will have to wait till i’m a mother”“when my mother says i deserve betteri snap to your defense out of habithe still loves me i shoutshe looks at me with defeated eyesthe way a parent looks at their childwhen they know this is the type of paineven they can’t fixand saysit means nothing to me if he loves youif he can’t do a single wretched thing about it”“he only whispers i love youas he slips his handsdown the waistbandof your pantsthis is where you mustunderstand the differencebetween want and needyou may want that boybut you certainlydon’t need him”“i am a museum full of artbut you had your eyes shut”“people gobut howthey leftalways stays”“what i miss most is how you loved me. but what i didn’t know was how you loved me had so much to do with the person i was. it was a reflection of everything i gave to you. coming back to me. how did i not see that. how. did i sit here soaking in the idea that no one else would love me that way. when it was i that taught you. when it was i that showed you how to fill. the way i needed to be filled. how cruel i was to myself. giving you credit for my warmth simply because you had felt it. thinking it was you who gave me strength. wit. beauty. simply because you recognized it. as if i was already not these things before i met you. as if i did not remain all these once you left.”“loneliness is a sign you are in desperate need of yourself”“you tell mei am not like most girlsand learn to kiss me with your eyes closedsomething about the phrase—something abouthow i have to be unlike the womeni call sisters in order to be wantedmakes me want to spit your tongue outlike i am supposed to be proud you picked meas if i should be relieved you thinki am better than them”“other women’s bodiesare not our battlegrounds”“you were a dragon long beforehe came around and saidyou could flyyou will remain a dragonlong after he’s left”“you look at me and cryeverything hurtsi hold you and whisperbut everything can heal”“how you love yourself ishow you teach othersto love you”“what terrifies me most is how wefoam at the mouth with envywhen others succeedbut sigh in reliefwhen they are failingour struggle tocelebrate each other iswhat’s proven most difficultin being human”(Most of my favorite quotes were from the healing section, and it was pretty though trying to narrow it down to my preferred quotes.)It also featured some pretty amazing illustrations, which I’m always up for in books:



























































Overall, this collection was exquisite and exactly what I needed right now. milk and honey is definitely going to stay on my mind for a while, and I hope to come back to it time and again.4.5 stars*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22104588-drew,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is total tumblr porn. Milk and Honey is pretty much a dream come true for emo fourteen-year-old girls who spend their spare time browsing deep, meaningful quotes written in pretty fonts like this one:Also: I am going to argue that this is not poetry. Poetry is Robert Frost and Edgar Allan Poe and Emily Dickinson. I know poetry covers a wide range of styles, and I'm not saying free verse isn't poetry. I've read some excellent books by Ellen Hopkins written in free verse, expressing the lives of troubled teens better than most authors could. The writing in this book is barely even free verse. It's a collection of short sentences, words really, broken into segments.i could writea sentencein small-capsand keep hitting enterso it looks coolbut that does not make it poetryIt really concerns me that this is a New York Times bestseller. Is this what people think of poetry nowadays? Granted, Milk and Honey did tackle a lot of tough subjects like abuse, heartbreak, and self-healing, but the poor quality of writing distracted from the message.Some of the verses were outright laughable:
when i am sadi don’t cry i pourwhen i am happyi don’t smile i glowwhen i am angryi don’t yell i burn
And this one is just too good:
the goddess between your legsmakes mouths water
Did you really just call women's reproductive organs a ""goddess""? I'm still cracking up.Also, why is this book so against women shaving? It acts like men hate hairy women but do you really think the average man sits around thinking, ""I would totally date her, but she has leg hair."" And don't feed me that ""beauty standards are oppressing women"" lie. No one is forcing women to go to the store, buy a razor, and shave. I shave because I like my legs to feel smooth. If you feel like your body hair empowers you, go you. If you feel like smooth skin empowers you, go you. I don't want to hear about it either way.The truly sad thing about Milk and Honey is the author actually made some good points. Take this verse about women putting other women down:
other women’s bodiesare not our battleground
This is a serious issue that could have inspired a beautiful poem with a powerful message, but instead, the author wrote two lines that once again made me feel like I was browsing a teen girl's tumblr page. If you loved this book, cool beans. But I'd much rather read poetry where the writing doesn't retract from every point the author is trying to make."

14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69603149-teodora,Rating 4 out of 5,"4/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog: The Dacian She-Wolf 🐺This collection of poems is so deeply honest. It says the words so many of us thought of, but never spoke. You can feel every single drop of feeling that ever ran through the veins and pens of the poet. Yet, not just a poet, but a human being. A woman."
15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788524-kai-spellmeier,Rating 4 out of 5,"“i am a museum full of artbut you had your eyes shut”Wow. Rupi Kaur really touched me deeply with this incredibly work of art. Her words of truth and honesty are so powerful and so full of emotion, I can't imagine anyone's eyes staying dry while reading it.A few times, though, I was a little confused, I couldn't comprehend the meaning of her words. The again came a poem about independence, how she was healing from her boyfriend's loss, closely followed by one that showed her hopeless and lost once again.Anyway, this was so much more complex than The Princess Saves Herself in this One, but however different these two books are, they both have their own power and strength.Here is one more poem taken from Milk and Honey that I can't stop thinking about:“i want to apologize to all the women i have called pretty before i’ve called them intelligent or brave i am sorry i made it sound as though something as simple as what you’re born with is the most you have to be proud of when your spirit has crushed mountains from now on i will say things like you are resilient or you are extraordinary not because i don’t think you’re pretty but because you are so much more than that”Find more of my books on Instagram"

20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50105236-ellie,Rating 5 out of 5,"To be simply put, this isn't a book meant to be loved or raved about. It is just meant to be read.I feel as if the people giving it three stars or so went in expecting it to ravish them, thrill them but it was not meant for that. Why on earth would you seek something so much more from a book that was written so truthfully, with feelings so raw that the hurt and the bitterness and the sorrows behind the words will never dull? This was her story. She isn't asking for you to judge if it's ""exciting"" enough because it's not a fiction meant to be critiqued. Life isn't always ""okay and then what?"" Sometimes you can get stuck before you even try to move on.if you were born withthe weakness to fallyou were born withthe strength to riseI am so moved by this. These were words she had woven out for herself and now we are allowed to read them and take them to our hearts, too.you tell me to quiet down causemy opinions make me less beautifulbut i was not made with a fire in my bellyso i could be put outi was not made with a lightness on my tongueso i could be easy to swallowi was made heavyhalf blade and half silkdifficult to forget and not easyfor the mind to followHonestly, I am a young woman, a college student, surrounded by women who dumb themselves down and go out of their way to impress boys-because they think that'll give them happiness, in the end, and it may, but it will be what they think happiness is rather than what it actually is. But I've never felt more alive than when I was happy with myself, even if it was a small thing. And this poetry encourages self love beyond anything. It normalizes it. You can't get anywhere in life if you're holding yourself back. The doodles were so wonderful! Sincerely, they made me want to rip out the pages and put them up on my walls so I can look at them and remind myself of what is and what isn't and how I should grow, too."

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterest***UNPOPULAR OPINION TIME LOL*** I'm honestly surprised by how popular this book is because not only is it over-hyped, it's just not a very good book at all, in my opinion. The poetry is so cloying and pretentious - just enough ""unique"" enough to be ""special"" but vague enough to be relatable. If I had to describe the style, I'd say it's a cross between fortune cookie messages & those weird 3AM posts that one weird friend you have on Facebook loves to post that are always a) calling someone out, b) posting about personal drama, or c) writing weird inspirational stuff inspired by their mood board on Pinterest.(YOU KNOW WHICH FRIEND I'M TALKING ABOUT. WE ALL HAVE THAT WEIRD 3AM POST FRIEND.)THE PRINCESS SAVES HERSELF IN THIS ONE is written in a very similar style to this, and I reluctantly gave that book 3 stars because it felt genuine, and maybe even authentic, even if it was written in a style that I didn't like and felt juvenile. MILK AND HONEY, I'm sure, comes from authentic emotions and experiences as well, and while I can appreciate someone wanting to share those experiences and use poetry to heal, I, as a reader, am in no way obligated to like said poetry just because the intent behind it was important. If ""intent"" was enough to get five stars, the star rating system would be pointless, because I'm pretty sure most writers publish their books with the intent of success and acclaim.MILK AND HONEY comes across as pretentious and unpolished - a dichotomy that should not be possible, and yet, in MILK AND HONEY, it is. The book also features some incredibly gross metaphors like ""the goddess between your legs / makes mouths water"" and ""the very thought of you / has my legs spread apart / like an easel with a canvas / begging for art."" Ughhhh, noooo. I can only imagine that the popularity from this poetry comes from accessibility and the format that seems so easy to copy that any young aspiring poet probably takes one look and goes, ""oh, if this dreck can be published, maybe my dreck can be published, too!"" The drawings are no better, ugly even, and look like napkin scribbles rather than actual art.I didn't like this at all. Everything in it has been said before. I could write a longer review ranting more about taste, expectations, and Shel Silverstein, but I'm trying to cut back on swearing and brusqueness in reviews, so I don't think any more negativity is necessary. This author apparently has a pretty devoted following on social media, so I guess if you're into Tumblr feminism and line-break poetry (which seems to be the new trend), you'll probably enjoy this.1 to 1.5 stars"

For one thing - this small book feels like a graphic poetry novel. Many of the pages had a familiar 'looking-style' which short poems have....but with the delicate, simple, drawings, I forgot I was reading poetry. The drawings tell a story --we feel the emotions from the them before we even read the words. In essence, capturing bruises women have experienced. The book is divided into four sections: hurting, loving, breaking, healing.This book honors women.....addressing chaos with compassion....love, loss, trauma, abuse, healing, and femininity.It's real.

Poetry is often hit or miss with me—I totally appreciate it as an art form but sometimes I just don't get it.

Milk and Honey
 is about happiness and despair, hurt and joy, love and sadness, and finding the strength to overcome your struggles. It is at times erotic, poignant, empowering, harrowing, and a celebration of all of the amazing qualities of women. Divided into four chapters—the hurting, the loving, the breaking, and the healing—each deals with a different step in relationships, both with someone else and with yourself.most importantly lovelike it's the only thing you know howat the end of the day all thismeans nothingthis pagewhere you're sittingyour degreeyour jobthe moneynothing even mattersexcept love and human connectionwho you lovedand how deeply you loved themhow you touched the people around youand how much you gave themSome of the poems are accompanied by small illustrations. I'd imagine that the print version of this book would make a beautiful gift for someone; I'm not sure if I missed out on something reading it on my Kindle, because I'm not 100 percent sure if each separate page is a separate poem or if the book is just laid out strangely. (I am also not quite sure if only some of the poems have titles or if each poem has its title at the end, meaning the stanzas between titled pages represent one poem.)Kaur is an absolutely dazzling writer. Her words evoke emotion, sexuality, femininity, anger, and hope. While perhaps some of this resonates more for women than for men, I still found this incredibly touching, incredibly moving, incredibly motivating, and at times simply breathtaking.you might not have been my first lovebut you were the love that madeall the other lovesirrelevantThis collection won't be for everyone. You need to be willing to put aside conventional notions of punctuation, capitalization, and the way sentences are divided. But more than that, you need to be willing to be vulnerable, to listen to Kaur's messages, and feel the feelings she is trying to convey. If you can do that, you will be richly rewarded by the beauty of

27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani,Rating 4 out of 5,"Milk and Honey, Rupi KaurMilk and Honey was published on November 4, 2014. The book is divided into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. Deals with a different pain. Heals a different heartache. Milk and Honey takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look. The first chapter, ""The Hurting"" is about the author's experience and struggles of family issues. The next chapter, ""The Loving"", has a more positive feeling. The poems have been described as sweet, and they are supposed to remind couples of the good things in a relationship. ""The Breaking"" brings the reader back to a dark place in the author's life.

It is simply not that enjoyable to me. But I picked this up after seeing it on my Instagram feed a couple hundred times. I expected to be easily bored by it, but I read it in one sitting. Not that hard since the book is quite short and has lot of drawings, but still. I was surprised!Milk and honey may be poetry (for the most part), but it tells a very cohesive story. A very powerful and moving story too. It is ultimately a book about hardships and empowerment and in my humble opinion, although obviously directed towards women, the message of self loving can apply to anyone, woman or man.The drawings were simple and gorgeous. Actually, the book felt a lot like going through a writer's Instagram feed if that makes any sense. All in all, a really nice read.***P.S.- On the funny side of things, this line ('the goddess between your legs makes mouths water') made me laugh so hard because it reminded me of Fifty Shades of Grey :))"

Actually, that's a lie. I know exactly how to review this book. I'm just not sure why I read it in the first place.There's a lot of hype surrounding this book, namely that it's feminist, eye-opening, beautiful, amazing, emotional, and meaningful. And while I'm sure that's exactly what some may have felt while reading this, I was widely annoyed and trying to figure out why I was wasting an hour of my life I would never be getting back.I probably should never have read this book in the first place. There are two reasons why:1. I hate poetry. I always have, and I know that part of it is because the only exposure I've had to poetry is either in school, where we had to read, annotate, and think about the hIdDeN mEaNiNgS for days on end, or the depressed Tumblr kind.2. I hate honey. I mean, it's in the title. It was basically a giant red flag I Naruto ran towards at high speed.Not to mention all the bad things I had heard about this book, in general, which was probably why I was so drawn to it in the first place, but yeah. The odds were basically stacked against this book, and things ended up exactly how I had expected them to be.I actually started out by listening to this, but not even three minutes in, decided that I also needed the visual copy to understand what the fook was being said. The audiobook was narrated by Rupi Kaur herself, and while I didn't particularly hate her style of narration, there is something to be said about her dramatic inflection which had me cringing at my screen at times. (At this point, I'm starting to think that I should probably just be grateful that the narrator had a voice that wasn't the auditory embodiment of ""dead inside"", but in all honesty, I didn't sign up for a soap opera either, now did I?)*ahem* Moving on.Now, the fact of the matter is that 90% of these poems read like depressed Tumblr egirl poems, namely:or something of the like. I'm sorry, but it is very difficult to take you seriously if a) none of your poems make sense, because of how filled they are with pretentious writing and white space, and b) you sound like you spend your time on r/poems. (No shade if you like to spend your time typing poems over noir backgrounds of rain on windows, because to each their own, I suppose.)Honestly though?These poems seemed more like something the author wrote in her spare time, as a form of self-therapy, or something. And then, to be able to publish them, a bunch of 'feminist' stuff was crammed in at the very end. Which, by the way, did not feel, at all, like the author had learned because of her experiences and what she had detailed in the previous sections, but more to be able to sell something.So yeah. I wasted part of my life reading a book I knew I wouldn't enjoy because I'm weird like that. Nothing else is new. That's it from me, but until next time, here's another poem from yours truly:write some thoughts(vaguely inspirational)in all lowercasebut make sureto includethe void of white space.- how to become a famous poet, apparently"

love is not cruel we are cruellove is not a gamewe have made a gameout of love
 I can't believe it took me so long to finally read this poetry collection, after shivering over so much of Rupi's online poetry snippets over the years, but here we are, and it was... captivating? Painful? Beautiful? Perfect?
what i miss most is how you loved me. but what i didn't know was how you loved me had so much to do with the person i was. it was a reflection of everything i gave to you.how cruel i was to myself. giving you credit for my warmth simply because you had felt it.
I feel that this is a poetry collection that will be different things for different people, but for me, it was a love story written for those of us who have survived abusive relationships, who have moved on and learned to love ourselves despite the lies we were fed. If you've ever left a toxic relationship, friendship, situation, whatever - do you remember the first time you realized things weren't your fault? How it felt like the first breath of air after far too long underwater? That's what this collection felt like for me. It reminded me of how far I've come, and how strong I really am.

Even better, this collection is so shamelessly, wholly feminist in nature and I cannot imagine not feeling empowered by the words Rupi writes. She is so proud of her womanhood and it's a contagious feeling.

It fills you with peace, acceptance and joy. You know that moment when you read something and you think „I needed years and a lot of pain to come to the same conclusion, if only I would have read this book earlier, it tells everything with such clarity”. I will recommend it to anyone who’s sad, depressed, down, heartbroken or lost. Basically the message is  accept your flaws, move on, life is flux, don’t let anyone make you feel unworthy. Be a shark. A nice, feminine, gentle shark. But a shark. * You are every hope I’ve ever had in human form. ** Love knows life has been hard enough already **** You said, if it is meant to be, fate will bring us back together. [...] It’s us you fool. We’re the only ones that can bring us together.[...] Isn’t it such a tragic thing. When you can see it so clearly but the other person doesn’t. ***** Don’t mistake salt for sugar if he wants to be with you he will it’s that simple ****** You’d rather have the darkest parts of him than have nothing ******* You whisper I love you What you mean is I don’t want you to leave ******** Like I am supposed to be proud you picked me ******* But I swear you will get through the hurt will pass as it always does ****** Nothing even matters except love and human connection ***** You have to stop searching for why at some point you have to leave it alone **** If you are not enough for yourself you will never be enough for someone else *** terrifies me most is how we foam at the mouth with envy when others succeed but sigh in relief when they are failing **I’ve heard THE PRINCESS SAVE HERSELF IN THIS ONE and FORTY RULES OF LOVE are similar to milk and honey.*"

I would start in the center and by the end of the semester my door would be a work of art. I thought it an intense, dramatic representation of my feelings about love, beauty, and being defined by men (they were boys but I was too young to realize this then). This book reminds me of that. The cover is soft and black. It is a collection of thoughts that are not capitalized or punctuated. It is fragmented. It is honest. It is passionate. The author is in her early twenties. I admire her passion and I absolutely remember feeling this way: broken by boys, devastated by breakups, dreaming of real love, questioning what it all means. I remember feeling everything intensely. This book would've been my Bible had it been published in 1988. To this middle-aged, long-married mom, it feels a little idealistic. Still, I enjoyed reading it and feel it is a beautiful and brave representation of the author's heart. 3 stars."

It is split into 4 parts (the hurting, the loving, the breaking & the healing)The hurting section was great. There was a lot about negative fatherly figures that was easy for me to relate to. I didn't really enjoy the loving section. I don't get much out of poems about falling in love so this part was just meh. The breaking was underwhelming. A lot of repeating the same basic thought ""you don't need a man"" I think I get it. The last section again was underwhelming. I just wasn't overly impressed by any of the poems. Even the ones I saved were just okay and would not have made an impression on me had they been in a poetry book that I love. It's a quick read but I think this collection is better for beginners to poetry who are looking for something more straightforward and easy to understand."

I read this as catharsis, as transformative journalling, as wisdom sharing and as fierce testimonial. Ms. Kaur writes of incest and sexual abuse, patriarchy and loss of innocence. She writes of feminist sisterhood, sexual bliss and obsessive love. She writes of the body and spirit from a place of chaotic emotion. I did not read this as poetry but rather as personal manifesto, an ode to self-love and a fight for both innate beauty and search for serenity. This will stay with me and help me reflect on my male privilege and utilizing it in a way that will make the world safer for both my sisters and my brothers.

I savoured them. Took as much time as I could with them. They're genuinely hard-hitting, raw, full of emotion and so meaningful. 'milk and honey' is split into four parts, taking the reader on a journey about love and all the forms it manifests into. It speaks about family, absentee parents, cultural standards that are called out for its bullshit, but also leading you into a direction that makes you come to terms with why it exists. Empathy. It speaks of the healthy, passionate type of good love, and the one where you cannot distinguish what's healthy anymore, damaging your soul in the process, but then ultimately you rising to establish and recognising your self-worth. Healing. This collection is strong. Daring. It's empowering. For me it gives a whole new meaning to being selfish: damn fuckin' right, I'll focus on me. I'll prioritise me.

1. the saddening
I had high hopes. As with other few works, again, the title wasn’t tempting at all but still, after reading two poems, I thought it could work. It turns out I liked those two poems and maybe two more and that was it. High hopes...i had high hopesbut now they’re fallingstill fallingthrough an abysssoon enoughyou’ll hear the thud.I just wrote that and it could easily be poetry. Because that’s what some like-minded people will find in this book: barely poetic clichés, some drawings and prose. It definitely brought some bad Lang Leav’s memories to mind, but the main difference is that this book covers some themes that are usually difficult to discuss. Fortunately, feminism has opened a door and it allowed more and more women to express themselves. However, I was left with the impression that whereas passion was there, the writing seemed slightly lackluster in comparison to other lyrical works I’ve read. All right, I’m prevaricating – the writing just wasn’t good. In other words, we have emotion but a very poor execution. my heart woke me crying last night how can i help i begged my heart said write the bookFrom that moment, I had a bad feeling. It’s a touching statement that oozes authenticity; an understandable need, a clearly unfeigned emotion: to empty your mind (heart, as Kaur says) and write. But that poetic introduction was written in such a trite, forgettable way that I took it as the first warning. My intuition wasn’t mistaken; again. Milk and honey was not for me. I felt like I had to find out more about the writer. In the end, reading about her life was more interesting to me than this collection.love is not cruel we are cruel love is not a game we have made a game out of love*he isn’t coming backwhispered my head he has to sobbed my heart - wiltingThey take your breath away, don’t they?The book is divided into four chapters: ""the hurting"", ""the loving"", ""the breaking"" and ""the healing"". It deals with themes not easy to approach: violence, rape, family issues, loss. I appreciate Kaur’s courage when discussing so openly the complexity of such topics, but talking about painful situations no woman would like to experience in her life and adding breaksto overused sentencesisn’t exactly poetry, in my humbleopinion.This is a book about survival, but that alone can’t turn this into poetic writing.i’ve had sex she said but i don’t know what making love feels likeThese kinds of poems carry some depth, but the language is utterly uninspiring. I don't expect Proustian sophistication, but simplicity has been taken too literally. The poem I quoted above is an entire page. If I’m going to read such verse, it’d better be as gorgeous and meaningful as Alejandra Pizarnik or Juan Gelman’s poetry, for instance, people who used the same minimalist technique. One thing is to discuss certain themes using a straightforward, unadorned verse whose austerity perhaps tries to reinforce their genuine, raw nature. This is not the case, especially when one reads ""the loving"" section: honeyed lines that somehow reached a new level of insipidity but could still put the life of a diabetic at risk.Not everything is poetry, there are pages in prose that were rather painful to finish. Suddenly I was longing for more 4-line hackneyed gems.
2. the encouraging
Now, there’s an interesting thing in a poem like... don’t mistake salt for sugar if he wants to be with you he will it’s that simple...which can be found in ""the breaking"" - an inconsistent chapter but passable considering the rest. As I keep saying, the writing is not great but the last four lines explain the very essence of relationships. I’m a big fan of the “don’t waste time” philosophy; if people want to be with you, they will. The rest are ordinary excuses. That might be the strength of this book and the reason for the connection many have felt: it may help empower girls and women. I didn’t find many poems capable of doing that but that’s my experience. I would still encourage people to read this, especially women, if only to help them gain confidence to speak their minds, draw the line, claim their rights. Women's empowerment can come from the most diverse sources. Kaur's feminist views are much needed.Amidst the repetitive nature of several poems, I also found a passage worth reading. The emotional depth, the clarity with which Kaur dissected that confusing aspect of our humanity was reflected in very intimate and heartfelt paragraphs (with its ebbs and flows).
i will tell you about selfish people. even when they know they will hurt you they walk into your life to taste you because you are the type of being they don’t want to miss out on. you are too much shine to not be felt. so when they have gotten a good look at everything you have to offer. when they have taken your skin your hair your secrets with them. when they realize how real this is. how much of a storm you are and it hits them. that is when the cowardice sets in. that is when the person you thought they were is replaced by the sad reality of what they are. […]the idea that they were so engulfed by your existence they had to risk breaking it for the sake of knowing they weren’t the one missing out. your existence meant that little next to their curiosity of you. that is the thing about selfish people. they gamble entire beings. entire souls to please their own. one second they are holding you like the world in their lap and the next they have belittled you to a mere picture. a moment. something of the past. one second. they swallow you up and whisper they want to spend the rest of their life with you. but the moment they sense fear. they are already halfway out the door. without having the nerve to let you go with grace. as if the human heart means that little to them. [...]
After that passage, there’s a list with 16 tips to get over someone. Stereotypes like crying, eating ice cream and starting new projects were also included. My connection went to hell after that. The transient state of things.you might not have been my first love but you were the love that made all the other loves irrelevantHaving read many poets – women and men – from different backgrounds and periods in world history, I’m afraid I can’t call this poetry. As for aesthetic qualities, they have made this book irrelevant. In relation to the message this one conveys, you may want to give it a try.Feb 18, 18* Also on my blog."

maybe i will just neverunderstand poetry unlessit is written in longer phrases and verses one brief line is neverenough for meno matter how muchi respect the ideas
Really, though, I have no idea how I felt about this. Milk and Honey is a collection full of emotion and meaning, but all the poems felt, to me, like unfinished pieces. Each little section of words could have been an amazing, cathartic experience... and yet, it just didn't go to that place for me. My favorite poems were the extended ones. For example, the poem on pages 140-141 was absolutely fantastic. I could read it over and over again. The rest, though? Nope. One good note, though: section four, the healing, was by far my favorite. I enjoyed section one as well, though it got repetitive. Two and three were worse, though; repeating the same words on love over and over got old fast.
neither of us is happybut neither of us wants to leaveso we keep breaking each otherand calling it love
Perhaps the unfinished nature of the poems is the point. Maybe Rupi Kaur wanted them to feel missing, to feel unfinished; they're all just little phrases and verses of her life. But it didn't work for me. I craved more out of these little poems and this little book.
i will not have youbuild me into your lifewhen what i want is tobuild a life with you
I also think it's fair to point out the accusations of plagiarism placed on Kaur in the Here are some sources on the matter that I think are relevant. Honestly, I don't see the poetry her as being that similar to Nayyirah Waheed's, and that a lot of the concerns are simply about the fact that Kaur is bestselling while other poets are not, which isn't something she, personally, can control. I'd like to bring it to people's minds, but I don't particularly think any of this is direct plagiarism. If I'm missing something, please let me know. Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube"

Although I didn't really feel that way with this, some of them were still beautiful. I liked how the collection was split up into sections about hurting, loving, breaking, and healing but I felt that there was a little bit of a disconnect in terms of the flow of things. Like, a poem would end and another would begin and it kind of felt like I was putting together a puzzle and forcing the pieces to fit? I don't know how else to describe it. It's really hard to rate these types of books because they are someone's feelings on paper, and who am I to say that a person hasn't articulated them effectively enough for me?

Unfortunately, I was let down and find myself looking forward to quality poetry collections to read next year. Just because this collection was not necessarily geared toward me, I did glean some positives from my reading experience.-Kaur urges women to treat their bodies like a temple. She explains what she views as the difference between sexual abuse, rape, not consensual sex, and actually making love. I view this as important for younger readers as they are learning to discover their bodies, especially if they are in a difficult situation in terms of be ready or not to have sexual relations with a boyfriend. Kaur's words might not be geared toward me, but I could see where a teenager could benefit from them.-For those who do not find the words powerful enough, or in my case, unpolished writing, each page is accompanied by a picture. I am not a fan of graphic novels, liking to leave things to my over reactive imagination. Yet, just as Kaur's words are not necessarily geared toward me, these sketches depicting lovers at various stages of their relationships are not geared toward me either. They do help express her feelings of love and grief, especially to those readers who are moved by this poetry, and by default enhance her writing.-Throughout this raunchy collection, Kaur points out that as a woman of color that she must take ownership of her body. She says she is everyone who has come before her in her culture and she should be proud of this. This is important for all women, not just women of color, and she points out that women's natural body occurrences are still considered taboo by society as a whole and should be celebrated, not made to seem dirty or impure or embarrassed by them. Again, this is most likely geared toward young adult readers and I hope that they glean much from this message.-Finally, Kaur tells women and girls to take care of themselves, to treat themselves once in a while, to make them feel good about themselves. Whether this is in the form of ice cream, new bed sheets, or singing loudly in one's home, all these ways of self pampering go a long way toward boosting one's self esteem.Even though the writing in Milk and Honey was not written with my age bracket in mind, I took a lot from this poetry collection. My main drawback was the unpolished work that was self published in many editions as well as the sketches that accompanied this basic work. Perhaps, Kaur's next work will be more mature in language usage and sentence structure. She has a powerful message to tell to teenaged girls and it would be a shame if her poetry remained largely raw and unpolished in the future. I look forward to seeing if she matures as a writer.2 stars"

the thing about writing isi can’t tell if it’s healingor destroying me
before i start this review, i want to please encourage you to check the trigger warnings for this one. this book was split up into four different chapters, and they each discussed a different topic and different part of the story. if you decide to read this, it talks about the emotion behind sensitive topics and is explicit in the writing. i am not one to typically read poetry, but i decided to give it a try and i am so glad i did. the way these poems were able to describe how i felt while reading this book and relate to my life at the same time was crazy. it truly has everything, and it was just what i needed. this was like my own form of therapy and it really made me think. i love that sometimes bc i tend to avoid my thoughts. it also gave me a new perspective on life and made me look at it in another light. this book was so raw and the prose along with the topics it discussed were woven together beautifully.

i don’t read a lot of poetry but i read this in one sitting and it put me through a roller coaster of emotions. this book told a story through collections of poetry and i found it incredibly beautiful. i couldn’t relate to every story the poem was telling but i did try to understand what it was describing. i still felt for the story that it was telling. this book spoke in the second and first person which made me feel more disconnected to the story at times. however i do acknowledge that i loved the perspective when i read poems that i could relate to. the way this story is split up and the different topics it discussed blew me away. pls feel free to give me more poetry recs

Not that all of them seemed 'taken' or 'inspired', there were a few that were just basic lines placed on top of each other to seem like poetry. Now I haven't read too many poems, I've read some, but this book just doesn't see to have any as it just doesn't sound like any form of poetry! I agree not all poems need rhyming and the use of enjambment can definitely be used, however, adding super short sentences that hold no significant meaning together do NOT make a poem.I did like the images however as the art style is very appealing. It’s really the only good thing I found about this book."

However, I can see why it would resonate so much with women, especially young women. I think it all depends on what you've gone through, and what you're currently going through.

I will be keeping this book around, and may reflect back on it from time to time as I go through life. "
57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29390149-faith-trust-pixiedust,Rating 2 out of 5,"i read this in onesittingand. i have to say.i was not impressed.—repeating the exact same sentiment for 200 pages doesn't make it more profound.I know my way around free verse poetry. My mom is a free verse poet that has been recognized internationally. She usually has me read her work before she posts it and we read the work of other poets together all the time. So I know what I'm talking about when I say that judging poetry is a tricky business, but honestly, this just wasn't anything special. It felt less like I was reading poetry and more like I was reading the notes app on her phone. I've heard the sentiment that was repeated over and over again a million times before this, so honestly, this had nothing to say to me that I didn't already know. If this is the first work of poetry someone has read, I can understand it being their favorite, and I do appreciate Kaur for pouring her heart and soul into this, but for me, it just did absolutely nothing.The majority of the book is one sentence long and is just a paraphrase of all the previous poems. They almost exclusively have to do with sex, which is fine, but when a book is presented to me as a collection about love and family and independence, I don't know, I expect more platonic or familial love than the 2, maybe 3 poems I got, especially when the vast majority are about how sexy some guy is. The first section was promising, but then it sort of devolved from there.And the ""loving"" section greatly confused and concerned me, especially that last poem. Am I supposed to see the whole ""making up"" thing as romantic? Because it made me want to call the police. Maybe it's a precursor for ""breaking"", but then why wasn't it in that section instead, when it so obviously belonged there? I don't know about you guys, but having sex isn't a good way to end a fight in which you both scream so loudly, the neighbors bang on your door because they're pretty sure one of you is being murdered."

What an amazing sad little book.Milk and honey is a collection of poems about different subjects. The author zooms in on love, in particular, heartbreak, for most of the book, but other subjects, such as abuse and femininity, are also discussed. Rupi Kaur can write poetry like no other. She makes everything personal and sad and her words are for her. I notice her anger, her dissatisfaction, but most of all, her love. Her prose is addictive and so well-thought.  ""You have sadness living in places sadness shouldn't live."" The story was not different than other poetry novels, but due to being so relating to my personal life, I was hooked. A lot situations reminded me of certain moments, feelings, in my life and I think a lot of readers experienced this. That made this novel very easy to read and very emotional. ""Sometimes I stay up thinking of all the places you are hurting which you'll never care to mention. I come from the same aching blood. From the same bone so desperate for attention I collapse in myself. I am your daughter.I know the small talk is the only way you know how to tell me you love me, cause it is the only way I know how to tell you."" This is sublime writing. This is writing I wish I saw in every book.So compelling and heart-breaking that you cannot not feel the emotions bleeding behind the pages. Overall, Milk and Honey is literally words dripped in honey and served in sugar-coated sadness.4 stars.  "
59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12794867-michael-arnold,Rating 1 out of 5,"Thankfully I didn't pay good money to read this. Could not finish it.I've heard it said that if you can't say anything something nice then you should not say it at all. Well, I'm not going to say a lot nice about this collection (of what? Of words?). I don't want to suggest, though, that this is not bad poetry, I want to suggest it is not poetry. It honestly feels like unstructured thoughts with random line breaks to give it the appearance of poetry, when it isn't. There is not more to say as an overview - it feels like something I myself might have wrote as an undergraduate and thought profound in my pretentious naivety. That is not to say this is simply waste paper. Some entire poems are actually quite interesting, and would have made good lines in real poems. Like:''i've had sex' she said,but i don't know what making lovefeels like'Which deserves to be a part of something more complex. The fact that all together there are 15 syllables in this poem means it could have been an interesting section, a line and a bit, of a larger blank verse narrative poem, like something out of 'Death of the Hired Man' by Robert Frost. It feels like it deserves better, but judging from the rest of the collection entire poems are made up of the occasional interesting observation like this - the poet knew she had something there, but did not expand or develop the thought into a poem, but instead put line breaks in and threw it into the manuscript. It's hard to lose the feeling that this was the writing process, another interesting observation is:'she was musicbut he had his ears cut off'The obvious complaint about anatomy aside (you can actually hear things with your ears cut off, just not as well) there is something here that has some kind of merit. What she is getting at here is good, but the execution is completely lacking. Other pieces (I don't want to call them poems) are just trash:'the idea that we areso capable of lovebut still chooseto be toxic'This is just nonsense, overly simplistic at best. Another example:'loneliness is a signyou are in desperate need of yourself'Again, this is at best overly simplistic, and there is nothing more to this piece - so it is a general statement made about the concept of loneliness. The point this is trying to make is that if you are comfortable and in tune with yourself you can never be lonely, but I can't say I think that is very true. Nietzsche's emotional isolation comes readily to mind as a counter-argument to this piece. I am using the word 'piece' instead of 'poem' partly as sarcasm, but few of these poems are titled - seemingly following some sort of Imagist modernist like William Carlos Williams or e.e. cummings (even refusing to use capital letters - I don't like e.e. cummings very much). When they are given titles they add nothing to the content. I know that is not a rule, and not necessary, I'm not saying it is, but if there is an attempt to be profound then the asinine titles just makes it harder to see this as anything other than the work of a poetic amateur who has not put much thought into her output. If we are to treat this book as a collection of poems, there is not (aside from line breaks) any use of poetic technique at all. And the use of line breaks seem arbitrary, neither keeping a consistent metric or playing with the structure of word sounds - like in William Carlos Williams poem 'The Red Wheelbarrow' for example. Between chaotic free verse and short prose essay-things, I could not find any attempt at variation of style and form. The free verse does reflect the chaotic, troubled theme of some of the poems, but I suspect this was not a deliberate reflection and instead the poet is using free verse because that's what she thinks is what makes it a poem. The utter lack of even attempting a clever use of poetic techniques again just screams that this was written by an amateur. Or worse, someone who does not care very much about poetry.To this book's credit, it does deal with some very troubled subjects, alcoholic parents, relationships, abuse, the differences between men and women, and as an emotional catharsis then I suppose others might find this book very comforting. But. Such subjects alone do not justify this book content-wise - as a collection of what are called poems. This can not even be classed as confessional poetry, like say Sylvia Plath or Robert Lowell, because there the emphasis was on the 'I', the personal which had something of the universal - and while that is here, it is not done in the same way. Here the focus was not on the experience, from which the universal might be found through investigation but the experience is still the subject, instead the focus is on on a vague attempt at profundity. Often in a simple, aphoristic way; it reads like very bad motivational posters.I said at the beginning of this review that I could not finish this book, and I don't think I'm missing out on anything by not finishing it. It's rare to find a book so blisteringly bad in almost every aspect."

66,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17025129-trish,Rating 2 out of 5,"*Actual rating is more like 2.5 stars.*Let me preface this by saying that I don't read a lot of poetry collections, be it modern or classic. This is new territory for me and perhaps I should have begun with the classics and eased my way into a collection like this. Nonetheless, I do think my unpopular opinion of this book would have remained unchanged. I know that 2 stars on goodreads has slight negative connotation but in all honesty, I do think that, for a debut collection, this was ""okay"". So let me get my criticisms out of the way. Out of some 194 pages, I bookmarked 12 that stood out to me. There's no denying that there are some beautifully arranged words in this collection, but a lot of the time, that's all it appeared to be - a few arranged words on a page. Too many of the poems in this collection have twenty words or less and, this is just my preference, but I like to read a poem that has depth and divulges something about the author or myself - not 10 words that sound like a statement or a summary of a text post I've read on tumblr. I know a lot of people praise her simplicity, but I just thought it was a little too simple for my tastes. The only other thing that I personally don't 100% agree with is the idea that one must love and appreciate themselves before anyone else can love them. There are a few poems in this collection that encompass this message, for example:""if you are not enough for yourselfyou will never be enoughfor someone else""Personally, the best friends I've made and relationships I've been in were with people who believed in me and saw the best in me when I couldn't. Self-love is a never-ending process. Just because I'm internally struggling with my insecurities doesn't mean that I can't be in a healthy relationship or that a friend, mentor, or significant other can't help point out my strengths to me. It's just a popular concept that I don't really agree with and there are a number of poems in this collection that seem to reiterate it. It is nearly impossible to overcome things like depression, anxiety, addiction and stress without support. To imply that people who aren't happy with themselves or who aren't the best versions of themselves will never be ""enough"" for someone else is silly to me. We all have the ability to inspire someone to love us, even if we don't think we deserve it at the time. Honestly, those were my qualms with the collection. Like I mentioned, there are twelve lovely poems that felt dear to my heart and I appreciate them very much. At the end of the day, though it has stellar reviews on tumblr and goodreads I can't say I was overly impressed by this. It was beautiful but didn't say anything I hadn't heard or read before. "

71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34622220-seemita,Rating 4 out of 5,"When a collection of poems begins with a subtle declaration that it was the only lullaby to a crying heart, you end up looking at a work that has gnawing rough edges.  This book has four distinct parts: ‘the hurting’, ‘the loving’, ‘the breaking’ and ‘the healing’. Resembling diary entries of a growing, sensitive girl, the poems hold in their bosoms, sharp jabs and delicate dreams, perplexed emotions and fragile hopes, redeeming realizations and mature homecomings. Kaur is unrestrained in her language as she goes about revealing her innermost responses to abuse, sex, indifference, friendship, love, heartbreak, complexes, abandonment, depression, pain, beauty, self-esteem, recovery, contentment and optimism. And her assertions are, on more occasions than less, startlingly percipient. On a father’s treatment of her daughter, she says, 
""every time youtell your daughteryou yell at herout of loveyou teach her to confuseanger with kindnesswhich seems like a good ideatill she grows up totrust men who hurt hercause they look so muchlike you.""
 Gurgling like a train on rampage, her thoughts find a free flow sans the hindrance of commas or punctuation. They are, albeit, accentuated by intermittent pencil sketches which speak a loud, powerful language of their own.  Her memoirs are likely to find home in score of young women as a voice which is searching yet serene, capable of sending many slivers of invigorating energy into a febrile mind. Because she embraces innocent love and doesn’t wail its vulnerability. Because she neither glamorizes pain nor does she strip it to its ugliest pores; what she does instead, is understand its inevitability and in time, its ephemerality too. 
""your body is a museum of natural disasters can you grasp how stunning that is""
 It may be pertinent to note that the chapters are equally divided into two distressing phases and two uplifting phases. And this structuring of the themes adds a certain sense of full circle to life; a palpable high that is attainable. It leaves a reader to appreciate the significance of arriving at the healing point, irrespective of the point she started from, and the sanctity of staying there. Her core belief, that emerges from these etchings, is that while atrocities cannot be predicted, they can be fought, and while blessings cannot be foreseen, they can be counted.  Written in no sparkling rhymes or heavy words, Kaur’s verses are refreshing and inspiring in their raw and unvarnished form. And perhaps that is why, hold a formidable promise of being a dependable friend."

I can see where maybe others would, but it wasn't for me. Let's start by saying that it's marketed as a collection of poetry and prose. Fair enough, I suppose it fits those well enough. But if you're someone who enjoys poetry as a fine art...well, you might find yourself wondering what you're reading once you dive in. One of the things I personally love about poetry is it's vast and variable interpretations - so this isn't a knock on this work as poetry, but rather a warning of it's variability and sometimes seeming disorganization. If you want my honest opinion, it felt like I was reading angsty teen Tumblr posts for 200 pages. Again, I loved Tumblr years ago but feel that I've aged out of it a bit - so maybe that's my problem here with Milk and Honey too, that I'm simply not in the target demographic. Again, this is totally fine! This book's contents are heartfelt, relatable, and seem to be genuine. There are multitudes of people who love and pour over every word of this collection. Simply though, it wasn't for me. What did I think?: This wasn't one that I personally loved but I can see why so many people consider it to be one of the most beautiful things they've ever read. Just because I didn't enjoy it doesn't mean that it can't be your favorite collection ever. Who should read it?: Anyone who's interested in knowing what all of the hype is about, anyone who enjoys heartfelt stories that are painful and genuine, and anyone who wants to experience a different look at prose. It's not that I don't recommend this book, not at all. If you're interested, I encourage you to pick it up. "

My head aches and my heart cries for a first love that was not meant to be. Two kids just trying to live life on the run of the American dream. Discovering love and themselves.every once in a lifetimedreams can come true,now and then when the stars shineyou meet somebody like you.In Milk and Honey, Rupi Kaur has a way with words, reaching out to a generation living in a vintage era. Summer road trips, Tumblr, and the peak of dark, sad indie music. This was the perfect fit to it all.If we talk about the content, we're going to find ourselves surrounded with basic poetry that actually has the ability to make you feel something. Yes, I do acknowledge that this isn't Sylvia Plath or Nietzsche that we're talking about, but it's one of those reads that -as ""bad"" as it is- can truly move something inside of you.But why? This collection of poetry isn't only about the heartbreak you go through whenever there's a breakup. Kaur also goes into strong topics like abuse, low self-esteem and toxic relationships with verses that are powerful enough to raise awareness.Besides its unoriginal writing and worn-out format, I find this book to be cute and important. Also enjoyable, since it's a pretty fast read that you can devour in one sitting. ""do not bother holding on tothat thing that does not want you-you cannot make it stay"""

They say ""And her playing is strange, like a mood that passes into you."" That reminds of this. Rupi has created a mood that has passed into me at such a deep level. I heard the hype about this and so I checked it out and I get it. This is the fire of life, primordial fire. This is the spark. She has written the fire and light that passes into us and we are all searching to connect with. This is a book of passion. To read this book is to reconnect with our passion in life. I feel like I am 20 again. I am reminded the gift this life is. Rupi uses words, so how is it that words cannot express how deeply this book has touched me. This is a work of genius in my opinion. Poem after poem opened my heart and my heart began to SING once more. The honey drips from these words. This is a book of power and it radiates power.Listen:""I have what I have and I am happy. I've lost what I've lost and I am happy still"" OR""How you love yourself is how you teach other to love you""I can't say I know much about poetry. I love Shakespeare and I don't spend much time in poetry. This, this sang to my heart and I get this. This zings at me and awakens something in me.

Perhaps I shouldn't have assumed (forever dangerous) that it'd be more individual poems and less of a somewhat repetitive journey? Occasionally a poem will knock you out.I bought it because Kaur wrote my favorite poem from the last few years.

Such an intimate collection of poems ☺️ I absolutely adore it.my heart woke me crying last night how can i help i beggedmy heart saidwrite the bookand write a beautiful book of poetry Rupi Kaur did. I devoured this in one sitting. The writing in this book was simply gorgeous!you were so afraid of my voicei decided to beafraid of it tooThe delightful thing about these poems is that they go straight to the heart, to the brain and can leave you shocked. You do not need to spend time analysing ambiguity for a deeper meaning, the meaning is there on face value.This poetry was hard-hitting, raw, powerful, honest, full of emotion and meaning. The writing was engaging and heart-aching, covering topics of femininity, absent parents, violence, love, loss and abuse. It deals with female sexuality and pleasure, the writing erotic at times, Kaur also declares her love for female body hair... both of these topics which are usually rather taboo and topics which women still carry shame about, Rupi Kaur brings empowerment to them, to the female body.This book is split into four parts: the hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing. Each one dealing with a different topic. All of these exploring some form of love, whether this is familial, self-love or relationship love. Rupi Kaur describes the pain and the beauty of each love, creating a strong force of empathy. I was surprised to learn through reading 'the healing', that Rupi Kaur had trouble writing these poems, and what she did write stemmed from her heartbreak. Rupi Kaur shows us her bitter moments and how sweetness can be found within each one. She is brave for sharing her story, laid out before us. The simplicity of these poems was genius and I absolutely loved the illustrations accompanying them. This is a book that I have picked up, post-it noted, underlined and will continuously reread my favourite poems ( such as -the art of being empty). I have also looked at her other work online and it is brilliant. Especially when she garnered attention for her 'period' piece, a series of photos showing menstruation which caused online outrage. She is just utterly honest about a topic that is hushed up and she normalises it and brings empowerment and knowledge. Her work is remarkable and I definitely need to read more poetry like this!"
79,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2947323-dianne,Rating 5 out of 5,"I admit I went into this with a healthy dose of skepticism - the snippets I saw of the poetry in this book seemed ridiculously simplistic. You know how you think sometimes, ""That piece of art / piece of poetry / piece of whatever is SO childish, I could have done it.""Um. No.This slim book of poetry is remarkable - the genius IS its simplicity and spare but powerful prose. I am going to buy this to keep and read and reflect on. The artwork complements the writing, so if you do read this, be sure to do so on a format that supports the artwork.I truly loved it. This book of poetry is completely worthy of all the hype. Well done, Ms. Kaur! (I note that I am accidentally but happily posting this review on International Women's Day - this is a great book for all women to read.)"

Ok I’m fed up with teeny boppers and entitled young women shooting down this woman’s poetry. I’ve been holding my tongue for years and I’ve had it. What I said in my original review still stands, but perhaps I didn’t make myself clear. THIS BOOK AND POETESS ARE FOR WOMEN (and I’m counting those in the lgbt+ community) who have lived through crises that have changed the wiring in our brains, who have been raped, who have suffered abusive relationships, who have contemplated suicide just throw life away because what has life done for us, who were blessed with false reputations and are too weak to fight the fight anymore, WHO NO LONGER HAVE A SOUL THAT WILL ALLOW US TO LOVE OURSELVES. unless you can point to some similar event that you have fought through and can stand back up covered in emotional sludge only to YAUP I SURVIVED without you! then I don’t want to hear one god damned word from any of you anymore. Get back to me after you have grown up and suffered. Amazingly relatableEvery female from ages 14-94 should have a copy of this tearjerker in her poetry collection.

Broken into four sections,  Milk and Honey  is the story of hurt, love, pain, and healing. The poems are exquisite thought sometimes they seem  too tumblry  but they really do drive the point home. What I enjoyed most about this book was that it was able to transform the thoughts we all have in our head into beautiful, free-flowing words. It shares such strong emotions in such short words and allows the reader to think and ponder and feel each word. The cute little doodles that mark the pages were so refreshing and really helped imprint the message. Thought I was not a fan of the first book (a little too dark for me) the three following books were filled with uplifting messages of femininity and grace and beauty and acceptance and hardship and perseverance. A lovely collection of free-form poems indeed.  “my heart woke me crying last nighthow can i help i beggedmy heart saidwrite the book” 3.75 stars!!"

Κάποια από αυτά ήταν στίχοι, κάποια τα είχε πει τάχα ο τάδε ποιητής/συγγραφέας/παπάς της ενορίας, κανείς δεν ήξερε ποιος είχε πει τι στην τελική, στο ίντερνετ είμαστε εξάλλου. Μετά, θυμάμαι να έρχεται η φάση του Λιβαδείτη. Κάπου εκεί θαρρώ πως ήταν και τα graffiti με τα άθλια βιαστικά γράμματα που υποτίθεται πως έλεγαν κάτι βαθύ και ψαγμένο. Εάν όλα αυτά τα θυμάστε κι εσείς να σκάνε μύτη στα κοινωνικά δίκτυα, τότε μάλλον μπορούμε να μιλήσουμε για μια τάση.Γιατί τα λέω όλα αυτά σε μια κριτική βιβλίου ποίησης ονόματι “Γάλα και μέλι”; Γιατί έχει σημασία να δούμε πώς αυτό το βιβλίο κατάφερε να σκαρφαλώσει στην πρώτη θέση των best sellers των NYT και αγαπήθηκε από εκατοντάδες χιλιάδες αναγνώστες; Και τι ρόλο έχει παίξει τελικά το ίντερνετ -και η αναγνωρισιμότητα της Rupi Kaur σ’ αυτό- στην έκδοση αυτού του βιβλίου;Τώρα πατήστε μία παύση σε όσα λέγαμε στην εισαγωγή και ελάτε να δούμε τι έχει να μας πει αυτή η ποιητική συλλογή από μόνη της.Η συλλογή χωρίζεται σε τέσσερα άνισα μέρη. Το πρώτο μέρος της συλλογής λέγεται “το τραύμα” και αφορά ζητήματα όπως η συναισθηματική και σωματική κακοποίηση, τα τραύματα (duh), η έλλειψη τρυφερότητας και λοιπά. Η Rupi Kaur μιλάει για ζητήματα που σπάνια θα δεις να αναφέρει κάποιος σε ποίημα, όπως ο βιασμός. Νομίζω πως αυτό το κομμάτι μου άρεσε πιο πολύ απ’ όλα – για να μην πω ότι ήταν το μόνο που μου άρεσε.Στο δεύτερο μέρος που λέγεται “αγάπη” παρουσιάζεται ο έρωτας, αυτός ο έρωτας που ζεις στα early 20s και νομίζεις πως κανένας άλλος δεν έχει ζήσει αυτό που ζεις, πως αυτός είναι ο μεγάλος έρωτας της ζωής σου, κλπ, κλπ (been there, done that). Έχουμε και μερικά ποιήματα λίγο πιο τολμηρά, γι’ αυτήν την ανελέητη κάψα που σε διακατέχει όταν ανακαλύπτεις το (καλό) σεξ. Τίποτα το ιδιαίτερο όμως.Στο τρίτο μέρος, ονόματι “συντριβή”, όπως καλά φαντάζεστε, η Rupi μιλάει για χωρισμό, απώλεια, συναισθήματα πένθους και δε συμμαζεύεται. Η μετεφηβική κλάψα χτυπάει ταβάνι με κάτι ποιήματα όπως “ήμουν ένα μουσείο γεμάτο έργα τέχνης, αλλά είχες τα μάτια σου κλειστά” και “αυτό που αξίζει να το κρατήσεις, δεν το αφήνεις να φύγει”.Και στο τελευταίο μέρος έχουμε την “ίαση”, όπου υποτίθεται πως έρχεται η αποδοχή, η ωριμότητα και όλα αυτά τα ωραία.Για να είμαι ειλικρινής, μοιάζει περισσότερο με τα συναισθηματικά στάδια που περνάει κάποιος στα 20 του σε μορφή σημειώσεων από το προσωπικό του ημερολόγιο. Τι το ιδιαίτερο υπάρχει σ’ αυτό; Γιατί έχει γίνει τόσος χαμός;Ε λοιπόν, η απάντηση είναι πολύ απλή: η Rupi Kaur δεν ξεφύτρωσε μια μέρα από το πουθενά και είπε “γεια σας, αυτά είναι τα ποιήματά μου”, δίνοντάς τα σε κάποιον εκδότη κι αυτός ενθουσιάστηκε μεμιάς. Η Rupi ήταν internet famous προτού καν γίνουν όλα αυτά. Δε χρειαζόταν να ανησυχεί για το αν θα ήθελε κάποιος να διαβάσει τα ποιήματά της, αφού αυτά είχαν αγαπηθεί ήδη από χιλιάδες χρήστες του tumblr που τα έκαναν συνεχώς reblog.Από το λήμμα στη Wikipedia με το όνομά της διαβάζουμε:Throughout high school, Kaur shared her writing anonymously. In 2013, she began sharing her work under her own name on Tumblr. She took her writing to Instagram in 2014 and began adding simple illustrations. She went from having several followers to gaining over a million on Instagram, helping her reach audiences outside of the United States. This led to her book Milk and Honey to be translated in to 25 languages.Και το μυστήριο μόλις λύθηκε.Με αφορμή την Rupi Kaur, μπορούμε κάλλιστα να μιλήσουμε για την γενικότερη τάση της εποχής που διανύουμε, δηλαδή για τα στιχάκια που είναι αυθόρμητα και απλά γραμμένα, χωρίς στην πραγματικότητα να κρύβουν κάποιο ιδιαίτερο “βάθος” πέρα από τα γνωστά πάθη του ανθρώπου περί σχέσεων, ανασφάλειας και μοναξιάς. Σας πληροφορώ ότι αυτά τα στιχάκια πουλάνε ΣΑΝ ΤΡΕΛΑ στα κοινωνικά δίκτυα. Κι ενώ έχουμε πλήθος γραφής χωρίς υπογραφή, όταν αυτή αρχίζει να έχει απήχηση (likes), οι δημιουργοί τους τελικά αποφασίζουν να κοτσάρουν και το όνομά τους -ή κάποιο ψευδώνυμο- από κάτω, όπως ακριβώς η Rupi Kaur. Δεν πιστεύετε ότι αυτό συμβαίνει στην Ελλάδα; Θα σας παραπέμψω σε Δεγαμινιώτη και Ρενέ. Αυτός ο συναισθηματικός εγωκεντρισμός και η αίσθηση του “μου χρωστάει η ζωή” κατάφερε να αποτυπωθεί και σε πεζά κείμενα, με ελαφριά ποιητική διάσταση και να γίνει ολόκληρο σάιτ. Ναι, για το πίλοου φάιτς λέω. Ο κόσμος που προωθεί τα στιχάκια των παραπάνω δημιουργών ταυτίζεται σε τεράστιο βαθμό με αυτά και τα παίρνει στα σοβαρά – έχω πετύχει ακόμη και σκηνικό όπου κάποιος τα χρησιμοποιεί στις συζητήσεις του σαν επιχείρημα-συμβουλή. Και οι δημιουργοί φυσικά το ξέρουν, γι’ αυτό μην παραξενευτείτε εάν δείτε αύριο – μεθαύριο στα ευπώλητα κάποια δική τους συλλογή.Θα ήθελα να πω πολλά περισσότερα γι’ αυτό το θέμα, αλλά θαρρώ πως υπάρχει κόσμος με μεγαλύτερη υπομονή που μπορεί να κάνει εξονυχιστική ανάλυση. Εγώ θα αρκεστώ μόνο σε κάποιους προβληματισμούς που έχω ως αναγνώστρια:Μπορούμε να πούμε ότι επαναπροσδιορίζεται η ποίηση; Είναι αυτό το νέο κύμα των viral ποιητών το ρεύμα της εποχής; Και μήπως όλοι εμείς που δεν εντυπωσιαζόμαστε ιδιαίτερα είμαστε τίποτα γεροξεκούτηδες παρελθοντολάγνοι που δεν κοιτάνε μπροστά; Ή τελικά πρόκειται για μια φούσκα που θα σκάσει και θα την ξεχάσουμε, όπως ξεχάσαμε χιλιάδες άλλα πράγματα που πήραν τα “15 λεπτά δημοσιότητας” που τους αναλογούσαν;"

**2.5 stars**you might not have been my first lovebut you were the love that madeall the other loves irrelevant
It feels sort of ironic when you discover an author from your native land quite after the rest of the world already had, while asking you to read it, to which you obviously turned a deaf year. And the fact that I started reading her three simultaneously, whether I will like them or not, I am indebted to “Tonight’s Show Starring Jimmy Fallon”. It was in there that I found Ms. Kaur is of a Punjab origin (as many of my favorite regional authors), who made it to Toronto with her family at 5. Actually, it was pretty much her story along with her inspiring persona that told me to take up her works.Alas, if only it was what it promised to be! In a world of Instagram poets, I expected more from someone whose all three books have made it to the NYT Bestsellers’ List… and then I figured it out. In a world where anything which is even slightly unfathomable is ofttimes regarded as pseudo-intellectual, maybe it was “astute” to play safe with words everyone can understand. And in no ways are her words ineffective, on the contrary, quite sedulously straightforward:
sex takes the consent of twoif one person is lying there not doing anything cause they are not readyor not in the mood or simply don’t want toyet the other is having sexwith their body it’s not loveit is rape
I can’t remember when I read it this empirically, the last time. Still. Well, I know that gender inequality is still very much in prevalence, and women are being oppressed all over the world psychologically and physically(actually, more in third-world countries like ours, I feel), just as they were since the dawn of our so-called civilization. But that doesn’t necessitate to be told the same thing over and over, when there’s pretty much no change of language too. You can reiterate the truth as many times as you want, but that’s not going to make it authentic. The book has importance only because it doesn’t feel like mollycoddling the morals that comes from the scrapbook of a pseudo-feminist.I’m glad really that Ms. Kaur made it to the top, everyone has the right to give voice to his or her thoughts and endeavors. And she does it quite well, but not as exceptionally as you would expect from such a charismatic and believed-to-be-capable poet…for you are bound to come across dozens of equivalent quotes if you are addicted to social media anyway. These are just a bit more burnished, and the poet’s prowess is clearly evident in her lackluster yet eloquent sketches. I won’t suggest you to read it, for it’s more probable that you have already read it. Even without moving to the second page, if you know what I mean.(I actually remember seeing all of these quotes even before I read the book…sometimes I even spoke some myself. It’s not creditable even for folks like us.) Take this:
you whisper i love you what you mean is i don’t want you to leave

After reading the book, I had to take a break to regain my knowledge of English grammar even if it isn't excellent. I knew my record of reading four good books consequently was going to be jinxed. I know I'm not fan of poetry but the book goes beyond my limit to tolerate crap and I'm in minorities once again.I can't say that the poetry is filled with craziness because it's not. It's about the pain that women around the world endure, about which I think more awareness is spreading day-by-day. Now, the main question lies why I didn't like the book at all. Firstly, it's badly written. The grammatical errors and the arrangement of sentences makes it look as if a kid has written it. Sometimes, I couldn't understand the poems at all. (No, I'm not dumb if you have doubt). Secondly, it's exaggerated and obnoxious. I know you want to make us understand your pain but demeaning someone else in the process is not the way. Like there's one poem where it's literally written that a person is not treating his current gf properly because he misses his ex. It's fine that he misses his ex but the comparison made between his ex and current gf is full of crap. The poem is written in such a way that his ex is perfect goddess whereas his current gf is nowhere near her. That's bullshit. No one is perfect and no one will be because humans were never meant to be fit into the standards of others. It's awkward to mention but I'll try to sum it up in a better way. The poems don't have a proper line between love and lust. Sometimes, it gave narcissism vibes. I really appreciate the works done for feminism but sometimes people don't get it. No matter how much one tries, none can experience what victims go through. This is one of the books which tries to show pain but miserably fails. It lacks the maturity and rawness of the pain and healing. Not to mention that the sexualised images actually lessens the quality of the book. Thanks for taking trouble to read the review. Happy Reading!"

What is it about, you might ask? Everything important, I’d respond. Especially to girls who are still growing—essentially, all of us women.This collection of poems concerns trauma, loss, healing, and femininity. Much like it’s cover and title, the whole aesthetic of the book was very minimalist. Each page hosted a different story, and each story was short-spoken yet carried such a imperative reminder. I believe anyone who has gone through pain will be able to relate to Kaur, no matter the gender, age, or scenario. I found myself reading through this book just for the pretty diction. I didn't think I’d get so nostalgic over old wounds. It’s rare to find a piece of writing that truly grips your heart, as if to say look how similar we are! One of my favorite poems is on page 95:i didn't leave becausei stopped loving youi left because the longeri stayed the lessi loved myselfI recently broke up with an amazing boy for the sole purpose of needing to recollect myself before I could give my mind, body, and essence to someone else. This book couldn't have landed in my hands at any better moment. It is broken up into four parts, taking us through a journey with Kaur as our narrator. Each chapter tells a different tale of sorrow, but like most awful things there tends to be a self-revolution towards the end. That section (Healing) worked better than any therapy, medicine, or tear stained pillows ever could. Literature has proven once more to be the best remedy for heartache."

97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44463467-nina,Rating 4 out of 5," “people go but how  they left always stays” I usually never read poetry and I think my school is responsible for that. I hated writing poem analyses because I was extremely bad at it; I just always interpreted the poems different from how my teacher interpreted them. And I was also, and still am, really bad at writing poems myself which is why every time I heard the word poem in class, I was about to just leave the room. Due to that I never really even thought about trying to just read some poems at home without having to analyze them or continue writing them in the style of the poet. By now, my time in school is over though and at the beginning of this year I wrote down some ‘reading goals’ I want to achieve this year because I want to challenge myself and want to stop always reading the same kind of books. One of the points on this list is “read a poetry book”, so when my sister came home with a copy of ‘Milk and Honey’ a couple of weeks ago, I just knew that I would have to read it.Before I started reading ‘Milk and Honey’, I absolutely didn’t have any idea what it was about. I didn’t look up any information about it on the internet and so I just went straight into it. To be honest, I thought it would take me some time to get into this book and it wouldn’t immediately made me feel something. But after the first couple of poems, I was already hooked. I wasn’t touched by all the texts (poems and prose) in this book but there were a couple that really, really touched me and were quite thought-provoking. There were some poems in here that were only a few words long but still touched me so much that I had to put the book down for a couple of minutes to just think about them. ‘Milk and Honey’ is truly a great book and it deserves 4 out of 5 stars. I never thought I would actually enjoy it that much but I’m really glad my sister brought this one home with her."

Rupi Kaur writes about love and loss, healing and hurting with clarity and insight. And her illustrations magnify the punch of the words. The sections on sexual abuse and the breakup of a relationship were especially powerful. I don't expect all readers to love this book, and I can understand why some reviewers dismissed it as juvenile. But I appreciated the rawness of emotion Rupi shared.

Case in point: I downloaded this book of poetry from the library, on a lark, never having heard of either the book or the author before. Then I come to find out that Rupi Kaur’s Milk and Honey (2014) was on the NYT Best Seller List for 77 weeks, has sold over 2.5 million copies and been translated into at least 25 languages! Alas! The book is not really very good. So how do we explain Rupi Kaur’s success? Well, let’s just say that Rupi is a genius at self-promotion. She was a relatively successful “InstaPoet”—that is, a writer of poetry who achieves a following on Instagram—when, in March of 2015, she posted a photo of herself menstruating: lying down, viewed from the back, with a large spot of blood on her pj’s and a small spot of blood on the sheets. Instagram took down the photo, she protested; her followers reacted with outrage, Instagram put the photo back up.Here is Ms. Kaur’s original statement of protest, which no doubt contributed to the outrage:
 i will not apologize for not feeding the ego and pride of misogynist society that will have my body in an underwear but not be okay with a small leak. when your pages are filled with countless photos/accounts where women (so many who are underage) are objectified. pornified. and treated less than human. thank you.
 And thus a star—if not a poet—was born.I didn’t hate the book. It has its moments. It is composed of four sections--”the hurting,” “the loving,” “the breaking,” “the healing”--and more than a handful of poems—almost all in the first and fourth sections—aren’t half bad. Ms. Kaur is a Sikh whose family immigrated to Canada from India, and she is at her best when she either 1) describes the plight of women dominated by men who are distant and violent, or 2) celebrates her own particular ethnic beauty, glorying in her dark skin and bountiful body hair. (Kaur’s illustrations, which accompany these poems, are often good too: my favorite is of a woman whose luxuriant leg hair forms a literal garden—of mushrooms, of leaves, of flowers, etc.)Still, not all of the first and fourth section are good, and almost all the free verse in the second and third sections is bad: sappy love poetry followed by cliché break-up poetry that could be produced by any intelligent sixteen-year-old girl. And the prose pieces? Even worse. Nothing but the unedited diary entries of a semi-intelligent teenage girl.But let’s end on a high note. First, three effective short poems about women and men:
every time youtell your daughteryou yell at herout of loveyou teach her to confuseanger with kindnesswhich seems like a good ideatill she grows upto trust men who hurt hercause they look so muchlike you*you pinned my legs tothe groundwith your feetand demandedI stand up*our kneespried openby cousinsand unclesand menour bodies touchedby all the wrong peoplethat even in a bed of safetywe are afraid
And one longer poem (called “women of color”) about a new definition of female beauty:
my issue with what they consider beautifulis their concept of beautycenters around excluding peopleI find hair beautifulwhen a woman wears itlike a garden on her skinthat is the definition of beautybig hooked nosespointing upward to the skylike they’re risingto the occasionskin the color of the earthmy ancestors planted crops onto fed a lineage of women withthighs thick as tree trunkseyes like almondsdeep hooded with convictionthe rivers of punjabflow through my bloodstream sodon’t tell me my womenaren’t as beautiful asthe ones in your countryour backstell storiesno bookshave the spine to carry

Much more social media savvy people have termed it 'tumblr thoughts' or even 'tumblr porn'...make of that what you will. The language is bold and breezy like you might hear at an in-your-face poetry slam. Fine. But the bold and the slam is pretty much all it has to offer. Rather like a well done advertising slogan, not like a literary work that makes you think. And when reviewers can do parody versions of the poems that are just as good as the originals, something's not right. These two from GR reviewer Sofia were particularly good...i brought youice creambut you werelactose intolerant-sofiai stayed ata bed and breakfastthe room had no bedbut they stillbrought me an egg- sofiaThat's exactly what the poems in this collection are like.

106,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23051860-yashfa,Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5 stars Let's just start with I agree with all of the overall themes book gave out, and perhaps because I'm prone being picky when it comes to how sentimentally ""deep"" a book is, this book was not for me. I love poetry, and perhaps this book is nice and fresh for some, but this felt like beginner's level poetry for me. I did however LOVE the illustrations in this book, and if they were a separate book I would have given them five stars alone. To me, most of these poems were just a collection of scattered words and random metaphors. The pattern of the few poems I did enjoy were a bit longer than the rest of the poem, and I realize if Kaur had developed some of her messages I might have actually enjoyed more of her poems. I really appreciated the messages Kaur attempted to spread, but when a poem had six words, and three word breaks, it just felt more in the format of a poem rather than being an actual poem. There were some poems like:“youare your ownsoul mate.”Again, great message, but if I knew this is the poetry that has been such highly praised, I would not have picked up this book in the first place.And then rare poems like this, which was probably my most enjoyed poem (If only the novel included more of these):“you tell mei am not like most girlsand learn to kiss me with your eyes closedsomething about the phrase—something abouthow i have to be unlike the womeni call sisters in order to be wantedmakes me want to spit your tongue outlike i am supposed to be proud you picked meas if i should be relieved you thinki am better than them”The message of this one was not only so clearly conveyed, but it was well developed, unlike many of the other poems. “butfor some overrated poetrythere is boundto beunpopular opinionsand maybe because i have themit makes me different from the restbut in all fairnessi will not apologizefor being different”— meHuh, maybe I should write a poetry book.*also wanted to add something to this review. I've read many comments saying that this book doesn't deserve a low rating because the author poured her raw feelings into this book, and so it shouldn't be judged. Most authors do that. If you were to rate a book based on how well you think the author put their feelings into a book when they wrote it, I would give all the books I read five stars, because I'm aware on how hard each author works when they write.

A quick look at other reviews and ratings shows lots of people talking about how so un-poetry like this collection is, but I'd venture to say that comes from a rather narrow or limited view of poetry. Is this very flowery and lyrical? Not at all. However, it's impact comes in capturing incredibly complex moments and topics in just a few lines. Perhaps the most impressive thing about this collection is in fact the way Kaur budgets her words. (Also, line breaks in poems are significant and create rhythm and flow. Lots of these reviews think they are being funny about line breaks, but they are a pretty big thing in poetry...? Like...?)I loved reading about Kaur's decision to write all in lowercase and only with periods, trying to capture a language she couldn't quiet express herself in. That feeling of having a language so close to your life but so far from mastery is one I *know* and for her to capture that and then create an entire collection in that style was lovely. It also contributed to this fluid way the collection read. Milk and Honey is an apt title for more reasons than one, but it also captures the way small poems flow into others, sometimes slowing the overall rhythm with a thicker poem. While I loved the simplicity and more than once felt choked up by the themes, my one critique would be that perhaps it could've been tightened just a bit to save some of the shorter poems from feeling repetitive. Overall, though, super simple and thus impressive in its impact and loveliness. our backstell storiesno books havethe spine tocarry--women of color"

The recreational use of this body is seen as beautiful while it's nature is seen as ugly.""That piece of poetry from Kaur is probably one of my favourites from this particular collection, and let's be honest here, it knocked me out. It couldn't ring any more true for me. It's like when a woman mentions her period in public, some see it like it is a taboo subject, and we should all be embarrassed by it. But sex, well, apparently that is a different kettle of fish. While I enjoyed this collection, I didn't love all of it. There were some poems that I definitely didn't rate at all, and was unable to take away anything from them. However, I do see why this book was so hyped, and I believe that this book speaks in particular to young women, but really, I think it mostly depends on what you have been through in life.I liked the part about ""Healing"" where it's all about loving yourself before anyone else. It's about loving your body, your stretch marks, the hairs on your body etc. I just think it's important, especially in todays society that we live in, and today's unrealistic expectations of women's appearances.I found these poems honest, and thoughtful, and I certainly may refer back to this book, at some point down the line."

113,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45198798-leynes,Rating 2 out of 5,"I don't really know how I feel abut this ... underwhelmed and a little confused, maybe. A little disclaimer at the beginning: This poetry collection is impossible to rate because it's about Rupi's experiences, her love life, her hurting and healing. Writing those poems is what got her through a hard time and who am I to judge that? It's none of my business how she deals with break-ups and therefore my rating is based off two things: 1. the language quality of the poems and 2. the feelings the poems evoked in me (the latter being quite irrelevant because it's just my very unimportant opinion).With that being said, let's jump straight into the review.I read this poetry collection at my local bookstore in about an hour which means I havn't spend much time analyzing the poems whilst reading because a) I found them to be very straight forward (contemporary language, easy to understand, no hidden messages) and b) quite repetitive (same use of words, several poems which at their core tell the same thing). I definetly plan on re-reading this poetry collection because there were a few poems or just simple one-liners that really resonated with me and which I like to write in my little book of quotes. So this collection is split into 4 chapters: the hurting, the loving, the breaking and the healing. Whereas the first chapter deals a lot with Rupi's problematic relation to her dad (which resulted into her mistrust in men and sexuality/ femininity etc.) the latter three about her first love, the good, the bad, the ugly and how she managed to get over her first break up.I'm not a romantic person, not at all. Not one bit. I get easily annoyed by cheesy romance, I found myself rolling my eyes a lot at those poems in the ""the loving""-chapter but let's analyze this in a chronological order.The HurtingI had a lot of problems with this. It was just a weird start to the journey Rupi planned on taking me, the reader. She blames her father a lot, how he put her mother down and embodied that men are better than woman and woman are only there for the pleasure of men. In the same breath we have a poem about a little girl who was raped by her uncle and demonstrates on a doll where he touched her in a therapeutic session. This just confused me. Is Rupi the little girl? Why are those poems there? The LovingSo, Rupi falls in love, leaving her bad childhood experiences behind and finally trusting a male. She is head over heels. She loves exploring her sexual and feminine side. Good for her, awesome. I just didn't necessarily need 15 similar poems which had a strong Tumblr-feel to them. Like I could just picture my 16-year-old Tumblr-Indie-self slamming the reblog button for one of those poems without having the poem leaving any impact on me or being of importance whatsoever. The poems felt a little pretentious. But as I said before, I am not the romantic type. The BreakingThings get ugly and they split. Rupi, a known embassador for woman's rights and equality and vocal about not shaving and no period-shaming (all [to me] obvious things of course but great that she is trying to be another voice for that movement), incorporates a lot of poems about her now ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend and how this girlfriend isn't as good as she (Rupi) is and how the new girl can't satisfy her boy as much as she could in the past. Competition much? How stupid and against the belief of women supporting each other instead of putting one another down is that? Those poems were just cringe-worthy.The HealingSuddenly Rupi has the realization that all women are equal and awesome and that she is better off alone and doesn't need male appreciation to be a full woman. Along the lines of the sterotypical ""I need to love myself first before a man can love me"". Not something I needed to hear again and definitely not 15 times in a row. Nonetheless, there were some pretty remarkable poems in this collection which I will carry dear to my heart. My favorite (by far) goes at follows:“Our backs tell storiesno books have the spine to carry”― women of color As I said in the beginning I will re-read this, mark some brilliant quotes and if my thoughts change, I will let you know."

I’d been meaning to try this one, though, since it’s been selling like the proverbial hot cakes — presumably also to people who aren’t really usually into poetry. When I was browsing at Green Apple Books in San Francisco, it jumped out at me, and I sat in the hipster café down the road and started reading. The poetry collection is in four parts — the hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing — and I expected to just read one of the parts, but once I’d started I couldn’t stop. Some of these poems, often the shortest ones, which are just two or three lines long, blew me away and put words to feelings I’m always trying to write about. I’m excited to see what Rupi Kaur does next.Claire Handscombefrom The Best Books We Read In January 2017: http://bookriot.com/2017/02/01/riot-r... "

I did not include any of those poems in this review. Despite the average rating I thoroughly enjoyed this book, particularly chapters two and four since they did not depress me like her first and third chapter. I do recommend that instead of starting with this book, listen to her recite her poems on Youtube, which I have linked at the end of the review, because they are much better, and my favourite. (and one of the short poems here is actually a part of her poem ""liberation"")This collection has many themes, sexuality, abuse, femininity, violence, lost love, forgotten memories, and feminism. I did not even try to look for it, it popped up on the previous image.The chapters were:the hurting: this one shows all abuse and the effects it has on the victims. Rape, verbal abuse and physical abuse form partners or family members. This chapter might make you sick to the stomach once you read how some ""people""will hurt others for their own sake, without a care in the world for the damage it will cause their victims, I read short snippets at a time, it was too much to read in one sitting. the loving: learning to love yourself and others after what has happened. This is the first step to recovery, loving oneself and realizing it is not one's fault for what happened, and with that trying to move on. Such a beautiful part that also dealt with love and feminism, and hoe degrading others will not make one feel better, but will drive them further into themselves. the breaking: basically it is almost as if regressing on all the progress, remembering those bad things, but there is no stop in the fighting, this is the part where one becomes stronger. the healing: the final step, finally saving oneself. A happy ending after all endured. I was not the biggest fan of the writing, nor the length since I prefer longer poems, but some of these together, would form a brilliant slam poem. Her writing is simple and to the point. Per example, the poem below is about how if we are not the ones succeeding we will not approve nor cheer for someone else succeeding in our stead. If she publishes other works, I will most definitely read them. She is not W.B. Yeats, nor Jose Marti, but in her writing, I find a truth that makes me want to come for more. It is her raw honesty, she will not hide what she means, she will not use metaphors or allegory to make u find various interpretations, no, she will show us what she means and what she thinks of it. And there is nothing more perfect than honesty told through poetry. This is her performing her poetry on Youtube. All beautiful. broken english. About immigrant life and their sacrifices. milk and honey: the official songliberation. Triggers for sexual assault. "

Few simple words can move your heart, it can pull you apart and at the same time put you together. For such a long time I did not know I needed to read this book. This was not words for my soul but rather a balm. A balm not to stop the aches but a balm to soothe the burns that I have been carrying for so long. I do not know how long we will be waiting like this. Pushed to the ground, expected to be crawling on their knees expecting us to bow down. You think I am talking of a time passed but in certain manner we still are. The simplicity in the manner in which Kaur has worded everything is the true beauty of the book. This is what that captured the audience. Also every scene is relatable for every single one of us. At one point we all have gone through such instances. Many times I paused while my felling were running on overdrive. This was fuel that was needed for my heart. The spark to jump start my passion. At points in love I stopped for a while. Is this possible? For me now it is something of stories and movies. Not what would happen to me. So much has happened that I now longer believe in a thing called eternal love. I do not expect anyone to love me that long. I am not saying this regrettably. This is what I have grown up to believe. Do not feel sad for me if you read this. It is the belief that I have been inbred with. I am not apologetic for who I am and I do not expect anyone to fully understand it either. This book is not to be read and set aside but to be read over and over again. A reminder that we are women and we are all worth it."

Por lo que se me hizo una obra linda por momentos pero generalmente intrascendente y poco original.Aun así admito que aprecio los dibujos que acompañan el texto, son simples, apenas esbozos, pero funcionan divinamente con la estética de los poemas.Una buena opción, tal vez, para quien quiera iniciarse con la poesía pero poco recomendado para los veteranos de los poemarios."

Only thing I'll say is it romanticized rape and I'm not okay with that. I also guess I have a different type of depression and anxiety because I didn't like or connect to the way it was handled/poetrized (is that even a word? Well it is now.)
124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7477266-sarah,Rating 2 out of 5,"This was just an okay read for me. Poetry is a tricky one for me because I either have to really relate to the poetry or I have to think that it's wonderfully written to really like it. A book can get by without being relatable or without being wonderfully written so I feel like poetry is harder for me to like. Which brings me on to this book. I felt like it was just meh apart from the first part. The illustrations were alright, I did like most of them. All in all, I highlighted four poems that I really liked. These were midweek sessions, the idea of shrinking is hereditary, if you want to know the type of man he is & the alcoholic parent one. I liked quotes from a few others but a lot of what I liked was regurgitated stuff I have seen elsewhere or things that have just been phrased differently. I could really relate to the first part -The Hurting. The poetry itself wasn't very profound but it was extremely relatable. The second part -The Loving was mostly meh for me. When I was reading it, I didn't see real love in the poems. I saw something quite passionate but not something that screamed ""true love"". I've been in love before but I couldn't really relate to it. The Breaking, part three was probably my least favourite section. This was the part that had tumblr poetry written all over it. When I was reading the section, I just could 100% imagine it as a dramatic text post or like text on a random picture. Exhibit a: “i am a museum full of artbut you had your eyes shut” Exhibit b:“i was musicbut you had your ears cut off”Plus it had all this negative stuff about how he would never find someone as good as her sexually. Some of it was really bitter and just mean. I know that's what I signed up for - the good and the bad but I didn't like it. The last part -The Healing was the most generic section. While I was reading it, I couldn't help but feel like I had read this all before. It wasn't profound like I don't have to shave my legs for a man? Really?? And if you don't love yourself, nobody else will, etc etc. Sure, it's positive and it's true but it's something that has been written much more eloquently in other places. The writing was okay in some parts, meh in others. I did feel like Kaur hit enter just for the sake of making it look like poetry. There were a few things that were quite snappy and smart but most of it was average. I will put the bits I liked (even if they've been said before) at the bottom of this review. To conclude, I think this book of poems is extremely overrated. I wouldn't recommend this and I probably wouldn't read something else by Rupi Kaur. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~“he was the first boyto teach me my body wasfor giving to those that wanted”“you have sadnessliving in placessadness shouldn’t live”“you are a warthe border between two countriesthe collateral damagethe paradox that joins the twobut also splits them apart” (re parents) “i can’t tell if my mother isterrified or in love withmy father it alllooks the same”“love will play no gamescause love knows lifehas been hard enough already”“you give and give tillthey pull everything out of youand leave you empty”“love is not cruelwe are cruellove is not a gamewe have made a gameout of love”“other women’s bodiesare not our battlegrounds”“how you love yourself ishow you teach othersto love you”“if you are not enough for yourselfyou will never be enoughfor someone else”“there is sweetness everywhereif you are just willing to look”"

If you google anything about poetry, an image of the cover of Milk and Honey is going to pop up often. You’re going to find over 100,000 ratings on this very site, and you’re going to be intrigued. You will then find a copy of the book, sit down and read it, unaware of the content, and you will cringe at times, laugh at the silliness of some of it, but also find some poetry hidden within its pages as well. I didn’t know anything about this author until yesterday, and it appears that she and her “poetry” are pretty polarizing. And as much as I would love to pick a side and proclaim to you all how right I am about that side, I can’t do it. I’m landing right here in the middle of “this is ridiculous and not poetry” and “this is actual pretty good at times and sure it’s poetry whatever”. It would be too easy for me to write a review in her style of randomly breaking lines or just putting one word on a line by itself. It would be too easy to write that way and just poke fun at the whole thing, but the internet has already done that. I’m late to the party, and I also get it but don’t completely agree. A lot of thing feels like back in the day when I had AOL Instant Messenger and a Live Journal account and fired out angsty teenage heartbreak song lyrics or my own verses about how hard everything feels like it is. When I read about “instapoets” it kind of made more sense. This is some new type of poetry where you use social media to bust out fresh one-liners or short stories broken into long strands of verse. I can see how this could easily rub people the wrong way, and I can also see how it could speak deeply to others who can relate to the many hard topics presented in Milk and Honey. I don’t think it’s fair to completely dismiss this stuff or laugh it off, but I also don’t think it should be elevated too high in the poetry world. I’m a complete novice when it comes to poetry, but there has to be better writing out there than this. So I’m landing solidly right in the middle. I enjoyed my quick read through this, it didn’t take up much of my life, and it gave me a unique perspective into the life of someone completely different than me. That’s a good thing. Who cares of it’s not really poetry or if it doesn’t live up to some standard. It’s fine. Some of it is good. It’s easy to read. Just get out there and give it a shot. "

4 Kind in cruel situations STARS


Saben que la poesía no es lo mío, aun así últimamente me he sentido más atraída a darle una oportunidad, especialmente a la contemporánea.El libro inicio muy bien, dándonos crueles y crudas verdades sobre todo tipo de abuso. Algunos poemas eran realmente desgarradores, obviamente unos me pegaron más que otros, ya que la poesía refleja nuestras propias experiencias y como tal unos nos acomodan más que otros.Mi favorito fue este:El poema que me hizo llorar fue este, fuck como me identifique con él.

""father. you always call to say nothing in particular. you ask what i’m doing or where i am and when the silence stretches like a lifetime between us i scramble to find questions to keep the conversation going. what i long to say most is. i understand this world broke you. it has been so hard on your feet. i don’t blame you for not knowing how to remain soft with me. sometimes i stay up thinking of all the places you are hurting which you’ll never care to mention. i come from the same aching blood. from the same bone so desperate for attention i collapse in on myself. i am your daughter. i know the small talk is the only way you know how to tell me you love me. cause it is the only way i know how to tell you.""

En la segunda parte del libro, se empieza a enfocar más en el desamor y sentí que bajo la intensidad de este. O quizá es porque ese tema no me hace sentir nada, pero si sentí que el libro se desinflo.Al final retoma un poco el camino y nos da mensajes d esperanza, superación y solo seguir intentándolo.Me gustaron mucho las ilustraciones, son simplistas y encajan a la perfección cada uno de los mensajes. Léanlo, sin duda es uno de los mejores libros de poesía contemporánea que he leído (no que haya leído muchos). "

In actuality, it was much more personal to Kaur's own story than I had anticipated. I can't say I enjoyed it, as that is the wrong word to use when there is so much pain involved, but I appreciated Kaur sharing her story. I also found so many of her lines to resonate with me personally and this confirmed what I already knew - that Rupi Kaur is a master wordsmith who writes of pain with an extraordinary fearlessness and grace.Updated ThoughtsMy second reading introduced me to a side of these poems that did not initially reveal itself to me. I saw myself, and not their author, in the words and bonded with their magic more entirely than I had previously done so."

Bu tarz anlatı minimal şiir olarak yer ediyor, hatta bizde bunun benzeri olarak ""katt"", ""kat'ı"" ya da ""kesiş"" sanatı derler, anlamı güçlü kılmak için kelimeyi/cümleyi bölmek=kesmektir. Ama buradaki gibi kelime kelime pek ayrılmaz. Bu tarz çok okudum ben, tumblrda özellikle yüzlerce blog vardı takip ettiğim, hala okur ve takip ederim. Bizde de popüler, ünlülerimiz fln bile böyle kitaplar bastırıyor. Nys. Üslubuna diyecek lafım yok, çok önceden de kullanılmış bir tarz, ben de karaladım böyle şeyler zamanında. Ancak benim eleştirmek istediğim nokta şu: şiirsel değil. Bunu liriklik, uyak, ritim, ses ve söz oyunları, mecaz veya sembolizm gibi arayışlarla çok genel bi değerlendirme yapıyorum, şiirsel bir yan göremiyorum. Şiir duygu işidir hissedemiyorum o duygusallığı; estetik, sanatsallık yok. ki konuları itibariyle çok müsait. İngilizce olduğu için olabilir belki ama bu tarzda Nayyirah Waheed var, Button Poetry vb toplulukların arasında genç pek çok şair, sanal platformlarda sesini böyle duyuranlar var çok daha 'şiirsel' yazan, manyak gibi kendi hesaplarımda paylaşıp durduğum (demek istediğimi ifade eden kelimeyi doğru seçtiğimi düşünmüyorum şu an ama olsun).Bu tarzı aforoz edenlerin aksine, kadın bunlara şiir diyorsa şiirdir. Ki kesinlikle şiirlerinin içeriği, yani şiirlerini hafife almadım, 'ay', 'ah', 'ağ' dediğim, highlightladığım dolu yer oldu. Ancak dediğim gibi ben şiirsel ve duygulu (ya da duygusal...) bulamadım. Bildiğiniz motivasyon, kişisel gelişim, ilham verici, ve other püsürüklerden oluşan cümleler bunlar, fb ya ig ya da tt'da paylaştığınız. Bu yüzden şiir diyosa doğrudur, da, bence değildir (31.03.2021) Bunun yanında -minimalizm açısından- ki Kaur kendi 'minimal line illustration'larını kullanmış, çok güzeller fakat yine de ben bazıları için 'niye burada kullanmış şuraya iliştirseydi bunu' dediğim sayfalar oldu. Ancak bomboş sayfalarda yüzen o kısacık fakat vurucu kelimelerin arasında süzülen çizimler çok hoştu. Tabii bu tamamen yazarın içselleştirmesiyle alakalı olduğu için bir şey diyemeyeceğim, ben her sanatın, sanat için sanat diye bağıranın bile kendisi için sanat yaptığını düşündüğüm için ve siz de sanatçı olamayacağınız için onun gibi bakamazsınız o size söylese bile nasıl bakacağınızı.4 bölüme ayırmış, dördünde de ayrı bi temayı işlemiş. Kadın, aşk, ayrılık, taciz ve şiddet, travma ve iyileşme, aile ise kullandığı taşlar. Çağımızın lale çılgınlığı olan feminist bir kadın zaten.Bizde Pegasus çıkarttı, gördüğüm alıntılara göre güzel çevirisi (zaten ne kadar zor olabilir ki). Ben öncesinde yine tumblrda (twitter da olabilir) görmüştüm bi kaç kez, bi kaç ay öncesinde de indirip bi kaç sayfa okumuştum ama unuttum gitti.

129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40739358-shay,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 stars.Disclaimer : I do not read a lot of poetry and so take my review with a grain of salt.This collection was a deeply personal & introspective journal of a young woman's heart printed on the pages of a book ; her experiences with heartbreak & the tenderness of youth. The poems are about pricking yourself on the thorns of society. I found myself lamenting my own pain & regrets as I read. This book was successful in bringing out a plethora of emotions within myself ;  pain, anger, frustration but most of a sense of pride at how well the author(& I) has been dealing with this beast called Life.The gorgeous single-line drawings were so captivating & amplified the message by a thousand times. I might have enjoyed the drawings more than the poems (courtesy of my inner artist). Saying that I enjoyed this poem collection would be the wrong word because my heart was overflowing was a mixing pot of not-very-pleasant emotions as I read it, but it definitely is a bookI would recommend to someone who is looking for a reflective & introspective read.Note : I think poems are a very tender thing to review because they are so personal & what is 5 stars for one may be 1 star for another. I would argue that this has a very specific target audience that would find that they resonate very strongly with the themes covered in this poem ; violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity, while others may even find it vulgar or too general to be personal. All I know is the beauty of poetry comes from it's art ; the quality of being so open for interpretation and the different ways in which people perceive or resonate with it.〖 Follow me on Instagram (@shashaybooks)! 〗"

Kaur's poetic writing was mind-blowing, truthful and descriptive to the point where i was physically wrought with pain, burning with anger, drowning in helplessness, and falling into depths of despair. following Kaur's journey into healing, i rebuilt myself, and found happiness where it had always been: inside myself. the lessons in this book, the strength behind Kaur's words and the passion for justice in society made this read a breath-taking experience! the feminist stance and the slamming of body-image ideals being sponsored by society fuelled my delight, and made this a pleasure to read. the struggles of some people were very confronting, and gave me some perspective into the 'bigger picture', which has been, for embarrassingly quite a while, an unclear concept for me. i loved this book so much, the devastation i felt when i finished it was overwhelming, though the way it finished was perfect. the letter to the reader brought me to tears, and i truly felt as though i connected with Kaur in those final moments. is it weird that i feel so attached and bonded with someone i do not know? correction: i do know Rupi Kaur, after all. reading about her journey made me realise that she and i are one and the same. and there is no better feeling in the world than knowing you are loved and supported and never alone, even if that love and support comes from a stranger. a life-changing and perception-altering work of art.

I don't enjoy it. This book, however, read like a collection of posts from Tumblr (a comparison I saw made by Rose). I did, however, find a few I did enjoy and I'll list them: 
“don’t mistakesalt for sugarif he wants tobe with youhe willit’s that simple”

“i am a museum full of artbut you had your eyes shut”
This book (is it really a book?) handles topics such as rape, abuse and healing. It is an interesting set of events that occur, but I just couldn't enjoy the format in which they were presented in. Overall, cute pictures and good content but the poetry lacked the depth and thinking power I prefer to have when I endure poetry - not often. I do, however, see the feminism elements in this story and if you are more interested in learning more about feminism this may be for you!If you want a more positive opinion definitely check out Caitlin's review.

The author bared her soul for everyone which I always appreciate in any writing.Having said all this however, I’m unsure if this classes as poetry in my eyes.

I had seen it mentioned here and there, but it never caught my attention until my friend Caitlin started reading it and shared some of the most powerful poems. Not only were they powerful, but they also caught my attention on an emotional level. That's when I got the ebook myself and started reading it.milk and honey is divided in four parts (""chapters""): the hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing.Personally, I could emotionally relate to the hurting and the healing the most, and that's where I also found some of the most powerful poems.
it is your bloodin my veinstell me how i’msupposed to forget
Particularly I feel this one deep in my bones:
you were so afraidof my voicei decided to beafraid of it too
A couple more from the last part:
do not look for healingat the feet of thosewho broke you
And this one:
what terrifies me most is how wefoam at the mouth with envywhen others succeedbut sigh in reliefwhen they are failingour struggle tocelebrate each other iswhat's proven most difficultin being human
I could still see the value of the remaining two parts, but I also thought some of the poems in them were a bit...not really poems? What I'm trying to say is that some were just called ""poems"" becausethe author decidedto press enterbut they justfelt like plain common sense to me. While I still agreed 100% on the things said in them, I also felt slightly uncomfortable at the format of some of them. Regardless, there are real pearls here as well:
ifhe can’t help butdegrade other womenwhen they’re not lookingif toxicity is centralto his languagehe could hold youin his lap and be softhoneythat man could feed you sugar anddouse you in rose waterbut that still could notmake him sweet

You’ve likely either read them yourself, read multiple reviews already or at least have enough of an idea of its content. I kept hearing about this book and figured I’d catch up to the bandwagon and see what all of the fuss was about.I appreciate the openness of this poet and the rawness of her work. A lot of the poems in the first of the four sections resonated with me and I liked some of the positivity of the final section, although some of the final section read like pop psychology to me. The middle sections didn’t speak to me at all but I expect that’s partly because I don’t do relationships and don’t particularly want to spend my time hearing about the drama of them or about people having sex. A lot of people love stuff like that but I’m just not one of them.I really didn’t like most of the illustrations, probably because I didn’t like that one of the early ones featured a poem between a naked woman’s spread legs and wondered whether the poet considered this necessary to make their point. I also really, really don’t like it when people don’t use capital letters, especially for I and I’m. The lack of capitalisation bugged the hell out of me.The ratings for this book clearly show that I’m in the minority here and that’s okay with me. I love that people experience the same book differently and I love reading reviews that show perspectives that I don’t share or wouldn’t have thought of myself. While I really connected to the poems that spoke to me of my own experiences there weren’t enough of them to make this book one I’d want to reread. I hope you get more out of it than I did."

One of my pet peeves is writing ""I"" as ""i"" and that was all over the book. I don't know the reason behind this, but it made me cringe every time I came across it. Also,most of the poems are very brief sentences, I tried to recite this ""poetry"" but it was awkward. I couldn't connect to this book emotionally- I understood the point of it, don't get me wrong, but I didn't feel it.

Milk and honey by Rupi Kaur was a compilation of poems of hurting, loving, losing and healing. Each chapter gives so many beautiful poems that surely hit through the bones.At first, I thought that this would be another poem with the same concept as like the others. Yes, it still the same, but the difference was - it hit me each and every chapter.From start to finish, it was really mesmerizing and really inspiring that I almost highlighted all the parts of it.I am so in love with it.And I also love the part that it doesn’t not only tell about love, it also articulates that we women must love ourselves first no matter what. And I am very grateful to this author for such wonderful words and tips.I am really inspired.

I have a feeling, due to the hype surrounding it and the raving reviews flooding social media, my exceptions were set a little too high and it ended up not meeting them! There were a number of poems I adored but also a number I didn't. It was probably a 40/60 split between the poems I did and didn't love! With that being said, I'm certain I will reread it in the future and I feel as though, with a few more years and life experiences, I may be able to connect to a wider range of poems within this collection! I'm looking forward to seeing what Rupi Kaur comes out with next, as I'm definitely very intrigued by her poetry and as someone who's very much a poetry newbie, this was a really interesting reading experience!

From trauma to healing, violence to love and femininity, and loss to wholeness. • the hurting • the loving • the breaking • the healing Each chapter, specifically each page, contains a poem related to the chapter’s name; which is followed by a graffiti drawing in a failed attempt to look relevant —yet awfully sexual. The book tries to show a strong passion for independency and bravery for female individuals but most of the poems have no depth more than just a slogan. In the last chapter, though, it seems like the writer has got tired and just tried to bring anything that crosses her mind on the paper; however pell-mell it may sound like.Nevertheless, it is worth taking a look at, as you can read it in less than an hour; maybe on a quick trip on the train or in the doctor's waiting room!

162,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76439836-migl,Rating 1 out of 5,"TL;DR:Tokių lyg ir Demotyvacijų rinkinys, kurių herojė fantazuoja, kaip kiti apie ją fantazuoja.Patys tekstai tai mėšlas su medum, daug medaus.---Išsamiau:Nemėginkite man įrodyti, kad tai nėra Demotyvacijos, nepavyks – yra net paveiksliukai! Dažno teksto struktūra yra maždaug tokia:„tai / ko būtų verta laikytis / nebūtų pasprukę“ (čia pilna citata, ne ištrauka) Norėtųsi kažkaip paspekuliuoti apie jų turinį. Nenoriu įžeisti žmonių, pripaišydama jiems savo nesveikas fantazijas, tai iš anksto sakau, kad mano spekuliacijos – ne apie autorę ar jos skaitytojus, o apie tai, koks pasaulis kuriamas šiuose tekstuose ir koks žmogus juose kalba. Galų gale, autorei turbūt tiek pat rūpi mano nuomonė, kiek koks nors, em, akmenukas, o ji yra kalnas, nesuvaldomas kalnas, nuo kurio teka... krioklys!!! Žodžiu, supratot. Įdomu, kad šituose tekstuose kuriamas absoliučiai stereotipinis pasaulis. Jei reikėtų kondensuoti dabartinės popkultūros žinutes, (tariamas) įtampas ir reakcijas, kurių iš tavęs tikimasi tipinėse situacijose, šie tekstai tai daro itin gerai. Turiu omenyje būtent dabartinę popkultūrą, nes, kiek susidariau įspūdį, prieš 100 metų jaunimo rašyta poezija buvo panašiai prasta, bet temos ar požiūriai – kitokie.---Viena iš temų šioje knygoje – moteriškumas, kurio reprezentacija čia mane, kaip seną feministę, natūraliai erzina. „Šitaip mano šeimos moterys / išmoko gyventi užsičiaupusios“, „bet juk su ugnimi pilve buvau sukurta ne tam / kad būčiau užgesinta“, „pasakė, kad šioje žemėje į dievą panašiausias dalykas / yra moters kūnas nes iš jo ateina gyvybė“, „pripažįstame kokios atsparios / ir pribloškiančios yra moterys“, „man plaukai gražūs / kai moteris juos nešioja / kaip sodą ant savo odos“, „pašalinti visus plaukus / nuo kūno nieko bloga / jei pati to nori“Žodžiu, pristatoma kažkokia itin sukarikatūrinta versija stereotipų apie moteris, kurie neva egzistavo „anksčiau“, ir tada ji neva griaunama, sukuriant šiaip jau visiškai tokį pat esencialistinį ir buką moters stereotipą. Bet tai atrodo progresyviau, nes... seserystė? Gali skustis plaukus arba nesiskusti plaukų, yay!? Bet tie plaukai kažkodėl pavaizduoti kaip gėlės? O vyrai nejautrūs ir bando mus užčiaupti, bet mes neužsičiaupsim, mes rašysim poeziją apie tai, kaip mes mokam mylėti! Yay..?Vėl, aš rimtai džiaugiuosi, kad feminizmas tapo populiariu dalyku, bet populiarumas dažnai turi ir tamsiąją pusę (tai bent palyginimas, šios knygos minčių skurdumas ima persiduoti man pačiai), ir ta pusė gana gerai matosi šioje knygoje.---Bet kas ypač glumina ir gąsdina šioje knygoje (ir ką, kita vertus, galima kažkiek atleisti, nes ją parašė labai jaunas žmogus), tai begalinis narcisizmas. (nežinau, ar teisingai vartoju šitą žodį, jei kas išmanote, pasakykite, pataisysiu) Rašoma tarsi apie meilę ir išsiskyrimą, apie kažkokį vaikiną / vaikinus. DAUG rašoma. Bet to vaikino visai nesimato, jis reikalingas tik kaip būdas tekstų herojei stebėti save jo akimis. Net ne priimant jo nuomonę, o tiesiog stovėti priešais ir įsivaizduoti, kaip jis tave įsivaizduoja. „jis uždėjo rankas / man ant proto / tada siekė / mano liemens“, „labiau už viską / noriu apsaugoti tave / nuo savęs“, „tikriausiai skaudu suprasti / kad aš pats gražiausias / tavo apgailestavimas“, „esu muziejus pilnas paveikslų / bet tu buvai užsimerkęs“, „papasakosiu apie savanaudžius žmones. net kai žino kad tave įskaudins jie įeina į tavo gyvenimą tavęs ragauti nes tu esi tokia būtybė kokios jie nenori praleisti. tu per daug švyti, kad būtų galima nepačiupinėti. <...> kai supranta kaip tai tikra. kokia audra tu esi tada ji juos užklumpa. tada ir apima bailumas.“Kaip jūs galvojat apie savo buvusius partnerius? Ar galvojat kažkaip taip „Ji(s) buvo miško gaisras, o aš tebuvau šaltinis.“ Ne! Niekas taip negalvoja apie kitus, tik apie save! Ir tai tik tada, kai yra labai didelis poreikis save mitologizuoti, redukuojant kitą į kažkokį palydovą, kuris sukasi aplink tave ir tikriausiai į tave žiūri, nes ką jam daugiau veikti. Tokiu atveju ir tas buvimas kartu turėtų būti nelengvas, nes kiek tu gali prigalvoti, ką kitas žmogus apie tave galvoja, kažkuriuo metu jis ims ir pats šnekėti, kas gali būti nemalonu.Jei nesat įtikinti narcisizmo (jei tai iš tikrųjų taip vadinasi) teorijos, behold this: “net kai ją nurengi / ieškai manes / atsiprašau kad aš / tokia gardi”. Herojė fantazuoja apie tai, kaip (buvęs) vaikinas apie ją fantazuoja, kai mylisi su kitu žmogumi.But wait, there’s more:“moteris kurią sutiksi po manes bus blanki mano kopija. ji stengsis rašyti tau eiles kad ištrintų tas kurias mintinai kartoja tavo lūpos <…> tada ji mėgins mylėtis su tavo kūnu. bet niekada nelaižys neglostys ir nečiulps kaip aš. ji bus liūdnas pakaitalas moters, kuriai leidai išslysti <…> ji pažins mane tavo akių vokuose su gailesčiu žvelgiančią į ją”Ta prasme, that’s some next level shit! Herojei neužtenka fantazuoti apie vaikiną, kuris apie ją fantazuoja. Jinai įsivaizduoja dar ir merginą, kuri MATO, kaip vaikinas apie ją fantazuoja. Galėjo pridėti dar paštininką, kuris eina pro šalį ir pro langą mato, kaip mergina mato, kaip vaikinas galvoja apie šios knygos heroję.---Gerai, čia baigsiu šios gąsdinančios knygos apžvalgą. Manau (ir tikiuosi), kad autorė nesutampa su knygos heroje, bet jei netyčia taip būtų, rimtai linkiu, kad autorei kada nors pasisektų užmegzti tokį žmogišką ryšį (kas tai bebūtų – meilė, draugystė, banko apiplėšimas kartu), kuris būtų pagrįstas ne tik jos fantazijų apie save projekcija į tą kitą žmogų ir jo artimuosius."

I literally finished this in one sitting.This book has opposing reviews. Some people loved it but on the other hand some people found it cliché or didn't like the writing.Whereas I agree that this may sound a bit cliché at times, needless to say looking at my rating you might have guessed that I really enjoyed this book. A snippet of the poetry below..

""i don’t know what living a balanced life feels like when i am sad i don’t cry i pour when i am happy i don’t smile i glow when i am angry i don’t yell i burn the good thing about feeling in extremes is when i love i give them wings but perhaps that isn’t such a good thing cause they always tend to leave and you should see me when my heart is broken i don’t grieve i shatter""

So if you do not like the above snippet, then this book may not be for you but if you enjoyed it then pick this one up. It makes for an easy and quick read."

The four parts are:- The hurting, dealing with abuse of women in society- The loving, dealing with relationships- The breaking, dealing with breakups- The healing, the fourth phase of recuperation The book is filled with some interesting musings, some quite well-worded. The writing isn't properly punctuated or capitalized, making the reading experience difficult. The writings are awfully random and sound like edgy captions for Instagram posts. Some are just rants. And then there is the oddball that catches your attention and makes you feel differently and then you're bombarded with more of the underwhelming musings.I'm not saying I'm anti-feminist. I respect her advocacy for menstrual cycle awareness. I also liked some of the pieces in the ""hurting"" collection but most of these are just bad writing. Moreover, the lack of punctuation and capitalization makes it difficult to read, although I believe this was done to provide some originality to her text but then....Either I just don't get poetry or I'm too old-fashioned for this."

I wouldn't have know it existed if it hadn't shown up on my Instagram but when it did show up on my social media, it didn't stop and it still hasn't to the day. This book is either loved or shunned by people. Some people believe that it is an insult to call this poetry and others believe that this is the most beautiful poetry they have ever read. Then there are people like me who believe something in between. I believe the writing is beautiful and it gives words to so many emotions that we feel everyday and the illustrations are even more praise-worthy. But what I don't believe is that it is poetry. It is sold as poetry or to be specific modern poetry but I don't believe it is either. Everything that is written is very motivational and soul-soothing but I just don't think it is poetry. Because it is marketed as poetry and I do think that Rupi Kaur brought poetry back to life and so many people who never used to read poetry, they started to read poetry books after they read this and liked it even though I don't believe it is technically poetry (I know I keep repeating this). 3 stars"

However, she has miserably failed in fusing universal ideas and ideals in her works. She writes about issues which we generally talk in our day-to-day life. And then, what is the need of poetry when we can talk shit in the open? Poetry should be something that inspires or something that comforts or something that instigates. However, this poetry is some poetry that brings repetition and makes the verse of this poetess mundane... "

Lo leí en dos sentadas (1: the hurting y the loving, y 2: the breaking y the healing, que son las cuatro partes en las que se divide), porque la mayor parte de los poemas tienen cinco líneas y puede pasarse por ellos con la misma facilidad con la que se baja en la página de inicio de Twitter.No es sólo porque sean cortos.También porque su recurso más usual es tomar frases hechas, adecuarlas a la extensión según una partición de versos libres, y dotar al comentario-poema de un ""algo"" de ingenio. Muy como Twitter. O Tumblr. Y eso, según he visto en otras reseñas, da resultado: se adecua a cierto tipo de recepción, no es para nada difícil de leer, el mensaje va clarísimo y directo (el lenguaje no es sencillo, es simplista), los temas pertenecen a una agenda feminista (sólo superficialmente*, la idea no es crear polémica). Mezclamos y hay éxito editorial. Luego, para blindar, decimos que la poeta es sincera, que hay mucha honestidad en los poemas de Rupi Kaur, y que habla de lo que no se habla.Bien: no es suficiente ser honestos, ni abordar temas tabú. No es suficiente hablar desde el fondo del alma. La literatura no está hecha de buenas intenciones. Hay que poder ir más allá, más dentro que el fondo.No quiero ese ingenio fácil en la poesía. No quiero versos tipo:don't mistakesalt for sugarif he wants tobe with youhe willit's that simple. (81)Frente a ellos sólo puedo reiterar ese comentario de Monsivais con el que abro la reseña.No quiero autoayuda en la poesía, no quiero consejos para vivir, no quiero certezas zen de sabiduría bajada de internet. Quiero vértigo, y hielo puro, y dolor, y estridencia, y llamarada. No quiero un arte que me arrope y me trate con la condescendencia de los que creen que triunfaron (""-Ya, ya, tranquilo, yo también sufrí, lo que tienes que hacer para dejar de hacerlo es...""). Quiero la compañía de los otros que se descubren derrotados, que están perdidos, que no comprenden.Llegué a esta autora entusiasmado**, mi decepción fue mayúscula.No, gracias pero no. Me quedo con Plath, con Dickinson, y con el deber de revisar la poesía norteamericana actual para levantarme el ánimo.----------------------------------------Ahora, los asteriscos:El primero *, tiene que ver con el llamado feminismo que enuncian varias críticas. Kaur habla del abuso sexual, de la menstruación, de su ser mujer en el mundo. Cuando no es claramente panfletaria (ya he hablado antes de mis dudas al aproximarse a los textos con un prejuicio frente a esto: no está mal, de entrada, ser panfleto), como en el poema de la menstruación, se diría que trabaja para visibilizar lo femenino desde la escritura, haciéndolo en una doble construcción: la mujer que se adueña de sus problemas, de su cuerpo, de sus sentimientos, y consigue emancipación desde su autodefinición (Kaur, por supuesto, da las claves para hacerlo); y el reconocimiento del papel de la sororidad en el proyecto feminista (el poema ""you tell me"" (163) siendo su mención más evidente).Sin embargo, encontré en la lectura muchos poemas apuntando a lo contrario. El que pongo a continuación me parece terrible, y no sólo porque lo considero una línea mediocre de conquista (la he oído con variaciones en varios bares):you talk too muchhe whispers into my eari can think of better ways to use that mouth (65)Como parte del sistema de paradojas que sostiene el interés del mundo, ese es el poema que escogió la editorial Espasa para cambiarle el título al libro en español (""Miel y leche"" les sonaba a colección de recetas para dormir bien), que, traducido por Elvira Sastre se llamó Otras maneras de usar la boca.Tal vez a Sastre le saltó la misma alarma que a mí al leerlo, y por eso se concedió licencia de cambiar el ""better"" del original por el ""otras"" de la traducción. Pero no es ""otras"" lo que dice él, susurrado en su oído; no es una invitación de intercambio equivalente. Él dice ""mejores"".Luego, el esfuerzo de sororidad de Kaur en ""you tell me"" (163) tiene vigencia mientras no esté despechada. En ese poema, la autora insiste en desmontar el cliché de ""no eres como las demás"", haciendo notar lo negativo de la expresión: para ser elogiada debe considerar inferiores a las demás mujeres. Bien. Pero en poemas previos de desamor no dudará en mencionar su superioridad femenina, y en cómo, mientras él esté con la otra estará pensando en ella, porque es inolvidable, y única, y diferente.Al escribir se le pueden prender velas a dios y al diablo, no hay problemas con esto, en absoluto. Parte de la habilidad de los escritores está en decir, con igual gracia, lo uno y lo opuesto. Mi lío aquí no es con la autora, sino con el ejercicio de los lectores, con el uso del feminismo como comodín.El año pasado leí Yo también soy Frida Slaw, valdría la pena leerlo, en esa clave, comparándolo con Milk and Honey.El segundo asterisco (se me fue muy largo esto), tiene que ver con el entusiasmo**: llegué a Kaur luego de ver una charla TED donde recita un poema titulado ""Regular tuesday"" (creo). Me gustó... Luego descubrí que no está en este libro. Luego descubrí que era muy similar a uno de los monólogos de Ensler en The Vagina Monologues... Y me gustó más el de Ensler."

""if you were born with the weakness to fall you were born with the strength to rise.""
I'm clearly just in a poetry mood tonight. I've been wanting to read Milk & Honey for the longest time because a lot of people consider this their favorite book and rave about it constantly, and to be honest I'm a little underwhelmed by this unfortunately. This poetry collection is divided into four sections: the hurting, the loving, the breaking, and the healing. 
""I am a museum full of art but you had your eyes shut.""
Don't get me wrong, some poems were really gorgeous and thought provoking but the majority of the poems in this story felt very simplistic and read more like tweets or tumblr posts than actual poems. Some of the ""poems"" were just so basic and unoriginal. For example: ""Your voice alone drives me to tears."" Or: ""i don't want to be friends i want all of you"" To me those don't feel like poems but just random thoughts that the author was having while writing this. All of the poems in the beginning were extremely depressing and very focused on this very personal experience I'm sure, for the author. Then the second part was all centered on a break up, and the poems were a little too dramatic and over the top for me, I didn't connect with any of it. I know it's nitpicking but I really hated how the 'i' is always lowercase it would drive me crazy. I also didn't like how some poems were so short, only one single thought and so simple and then some were so long, paragraph after paragraph - it all just felt so sloppy and inconsistent. 
""Our backs tell stories no books have the spine to carry.""
The best thing about this collection of poems is the positive message it has about feminism and rape culture. Those poems were so so so important and beautifully-worded. I think 'the healing' section was my favorite part of all of them. It had the most inspirational poems and quotes. I love the poem about wanting to apologize to women for calling them pretty when they are so much more than that - we should be calling women things like 'resilient' or 'extraordinary' instead of just 'pretty'. I also love the poem talking about how it's inappropriate to talk about your period in public, but it's ok to sell what's between a woman's legs, but the nature of our body is too ugly for the world to handle. Really powerful, amazing feminist shit that I love. I think my favorite poem is about having a balanced life, so I will end this review here:
“i don’t know what living a balanced life feels likewhen i am sadi don’t cry i pourwhen i am happyi don’t smile i glowwhen i am angryi don’t yell i burnthe good thing about feeling in extremes is when i love i give them wings but perhaps that isn't such a good thing cause they always tend to leave and you should see me when my heart is broken i don't grievei shatter”

“How you love yourself ishow you teach othersto love you”― Rupi Kaur, Milk and Honey
I try to express only my most honest opinion in a spoiler free way. If you feel anything in my review is a spoiler and is not already hidden in spoiler brackets please let me know. Thank you.This is a collection of poems about love and loss and being a woman.It was short. Thats the first thing I think when I think of this book. Honestly, I don't think poetry is really my thing. But I gave it a shot. It wasn't bad, and some of it was even uplifting. But I don't see myself persuing much poetry in the future.
How I choose my rating:1* Did not finish, or hated it but forced myself to finish.2** Didn't really like it. Didn't hate it but not sure why I finished it other then for some closure.3*** I liked it. I had some issues with it, but as a whole it was good. I probably won't reread again ever, but there is a chance I might finish the series. (If part of one) But if not it's not a huge loss.4**** I really liked this book. Maybe not a work of genius, but highly entertaining. I might reread this again, and I will finish the series. (If part of one) I would recommend to those I know hold interest in this books content.5***** I loved this book. I found little to no issues with it at all. I will definitely be rereading this and probably more than once. I will finish the series and reread it multiple times. (If part of one) I will recommend this book to EVERYONE!!!!

Tiene demasiado y poco al mismo tiempo, y esto me lleva a decir que me encantó pero que le falta mucho. Rupi Kaur es una autora que escribe con los pies en la tierra, con demasiada realidad en cada una de sus palabras, con poder y confianza en sus letras. Pero, se queda en querer demostrar mucho con poco. El libro cuenta con poemas que te dicen cosas que quieres y necesitas escuchar, con tragedias que te mueven e incluso pueden impactarte. Sin embargo, su lenguaje es tan sencillo que no logra lo que muchos otros poemas pueden lograr. Te hace sentir, sí, pero no tiene esa magia que te lleva a tener epifanías y milagros literarios. Le di 5 estrellas por el momento en el que estoy pasando, porque leer esto ayuda, hace que te identifiques y que te sientas en su piel, pero acepto que poner mis sentimientos hace que no sea objetivo, pues estos pueden cambiar en cualquier momento y con ello la forma en la que ves el libro. Advierto qué tal vez esta calificación pueda cambiar en una re-lectura.Es un libro que te hace abrir los ojos, te enseña otras maneras de usar la boca Y TE DA PODER CUANDO TIENES EL CORAZÓN ROTO. "

I don’t know what living a balanced life feels like when I am sad I don’t cry I pour when I am happy U don’t smile i glow when I am angry I don’t yell I burn
Hands down the best poetry I've ever read. I can't believe it took me tbis long to read it, I admit I was skeptical, I thought it would be long and boring but it was far from that. Reading this was glorious, it made me accept lots of things about myself also made me realize I'm not the only one that feels the way I do.This book focuses on four topics or sectionsFeminism LoveHeartbreak And moving onI'll just let these quotes from the book show how amazing this book is.
Every time you tell your daughter you yell at her out of love you teach her to confuse anger with kindness which seems like a good idea till she grows up to trust men who hurt her cause they look so much like you- to fathers with daughtersYou might not have been my first love but you were the love that made all the other loves irrelevantWhen you are broken and he has left you do not question whether you were enough the problem was you were so enough he was not able to carry itWhat terrifies me most is how we foam at the mouth with envy when others succeed but sigh in relief when they are failing. Our struggle to celebrate each other is what’s proven most difficult in being human.You must enter a relationship with yourself before anyone else.

Era obvio que la traducción no le haría justicia, ya que es poesía y cada palabra fue perfectamente acomodada por la autora para expresar sus sentimientos, y al cambiar el lenguaje todo eso se pierde. Aun, así como lo dije al principio, creo que la traductora hizo un trabajo decente. Pero por favor si pueden, o aunque no puedan intenten leerlo en inglés."

This book is for the broken, the lost, the love that comes and go, the struggle, the hardships, the victims of abused, just everyone. I believe everyone's broken in their own way. We can't see and we barely feel but it's there. We might never face each others hardships but all we need is each other. We mend each other. Comfort each other. Being there for one another is just enough. That understanding very much needed. I hardly read poetry. I even can count by fingers on how many of those I have read. Somehow something pulls me to read this book. Immersed myself in it. I do believe broken people will attract to someone or thing that is broken. And it lead me to this book. Of course poetry is not for everyone but feelings is, compassion does. And also there are some simple and meaningful arts. It's a great poetry books. Full of humans struggle. Simple use of words yet strong with emotions."

I'm so glad this exists and I'm even happier that I had the chance to read it. Feminism is so important and every time a woman speaks up about the inequality in our society, she changes something for all of us, not only for herself. Rupi Kaur's writing is very emotional, beautiful and flowing, I loved how her poems were not only about self-sufficiency, feminism, but also about being better people, all of us, men and women, being kinder with each other and rooting for each other to win because life is bad anyway without us adding to others' struggles.""you tell mei am not like most girlsand learn to kiss me with your eyes closedsomething about the phrase—something abouthow i have to be unlike the womeni call sisters in order to be wantedmakes me want to spit your tongue outlike i am supposed to be proud you picked meas if i should be relieved you thinki am better than them"""

Some poems are only about four lines long, others take up a whole page of blocked text. There are beautiful illustrations by Kaur throughout to accompany her words, and her poems are surprisingly raw and ragged at times. Quite a few times in the last section I had to tell myself to take note of the things Kaur was saying, as they rang incredibly true and were somewhat inspiring. This is a great collection for people who don't read much poetry (such as myself), and I can see myself reading this again and again."

So much of the themes, ideas, poetic language used in this book has been regurgitated in that one. I liked book 2 much better than this. There's an overall sense of thematic cohesion and organization in The Sun that's missing from Milk and Honey. This book was just all over the place with the poems bleeding into one another till they all just sounded like the reiteration of the same damm thing. There's only so much you can read about breakups and losing your one true love and how that made you sad till you want to stab yourself in the eye. Unhealthy relationships? Crying over a good for nothing boyfriend who cheated on you? Feeling insecure or worthless because a guy left you? Yeah, can't relate. 1 star. "

I was not sold on reading this book, until I read her amazing review and then I just had to read it for myself. Also, thank you to my amazing friend that bought me the book for my birthday. #ThanksChicas!I'm so glad I saw Tori's review because Milk and Honey is a new favorite book for me! This small book of poetry really packs a big punch. There is so much emotion, heartache, and hope in here. It's unbelievable. I love everything about this book. The honesty. The pain. The openness. The femininity. The healing. The hope. Wow, just wow. Milk and Honey accurately portrays what it FEELS like to be a woman. I hope Rupi Kaur comes out with another book similar to this and SOON. #Man!IFeelLikeAWoman!I fully believe that this is a book every woman needs to read. If my autistic daughter were a typical child I would give her this book to read. I would give her this book and tell her that she is beautiful, be true to herself, support other women, and to never accept anything less than she deserves. This is something that all women need to be told anyway, but these poems really hit the mark. #YouAreBeautifulInEverySingleWayThis little book of poetry really moved me and I like the simplistic drawings that go along with them as well. They fit so perfectly with the poetry. #DrawingsGetPropsTooOverall Milk and Honey is a heartbreaking and beautiful book of poetry and similar in style to e.e. cummings, as far as format goes. I don't think that I can accurately describe just how much these poems resonated with me. I read this in one sitting and I already can't wait to read it again. This is a breathtaking book that I will cherish and read often. #IWantToReadItAgainI recommend Milk and Honey to every living, breathing female on the planet. Well maybe only for ages 12+, depends on the parent. #MenYouShouldReadItToo"

211,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5558460-caterina,Rating 2 out of 5,"Rupi Kaur's own fresh, fluid, and abundant line drawings are visual poetry in themselves - they were my favorite part of this well-presented, cohesive book. The written words narrate a young woman's intimate journey through the newness of love, love gone bad, bitter breakup and healing, in a series of simple, direct, short and very short soul-baring poems, bits of narrative or advice to the reader. I see that Kaur's approach speaks to many, and I don't want to take away from that achievement. At the same time I was disappointed to find only a few strong poems and many on the insipid side, lacking freshness or originality in language or viewpoint. I think these might work better as performance poetry, when vocal intonations and facial expressions and body language could juice them up. Would love to see Rupi Kaur take the next step and sit the feet of a master of confessional and erotic poetry like Sharon Olds (a very good and sensitive teacher) who might be able to help her take her poetry game to the next level without losing the audience she has already gained at a young age. I will take a look at her second book, though, to see where she is going so far, and hope for the best."

Dieser Gedichtsband hat mir insgesamt gut gefallen, obwohl ich zu Kaurs Herangehensweise an bestimmte Themen/ ihrer Meinung zu gewissen Themen oftmals keinen persönlichen Bezug gefunden habe. Ich fand ihre Worte stark und mit Bedacht gewählt, aber sie konnten mich emotional in vielen Fällen nicht so erreichen, wie ich es mir erhofft hätte. Einzelne Texte überzeugten mich, doch im Vergleich gab es zu viele Seiten, mit denen ich persönlich wenig anfangen konnte. Anders war das beim letzten Kapitel, „das heilen“, was mich gefühlsmäßig und thematisch begeisterte.Als Fazit würde ich formulieren, dass es mich definitiv berühren, aber nicht ganz bewegen konnte."

Von Sex über Feminismus über Gewalt bis hin zu den dunkelsten Erinnerungen bilden diese Texte so ziemlich alles ab und üben eine gewisse Faszination auf mich auf.

The book itself it split into 4 chapters, the first chapter explores abuse, the second looks at falling in love, the third deals with loss and the fourth is about healing. This collection of poems is a stunning look into life, love and loss.you were a dragon long beforehe came around and saidyou could flyyou will remain a dragonlong after he's leftOkay, first of all, I have to open this review by saying I LOVED this book, but I completely understand why people may evoke the completely opposite reaction. It's a love or hate kinda thing, I get it, but I find beauty in simplicity - look at my bookstagram photos for crying out loud! From the very first page, I felt myself connecting with these poems and with Kaur's experiences. I myself may not have been a victim of abuse, but as a woman I can understand where such feelings would come from - the suggestion that your body exists merely to please someone else. I may not have resonated as strongly with the first chapter, ""the hurting"", but the rest of the chapters felt as though they were written for me, and that is how I feel poetry should be. You either connect with it or you don't.The second chapter ""the loving"" explores those heady days of new relationships and falling in love. You would expect these poems to be more romantic, and while a lot of them were, some just weren't. You can see how some of the hurting and the abuse have been carried forward into her new relationship. The third chapter ""the breaking"" quickly contrasts the previous with heart-wrenching descriptions of what it feels like to go through a breakup and the loneliness that follows.""the healing"" chapter was my favourite, just full of uplifting, inspiring, thoughtful pieces.The poems are so powerful and full of emotion and they really touched me. It's a book I can't wait to revisit and read more slowly, as initially I feel like I just devoured it. I did re-read certain passages at the time, but overall, I'd like to immerse myself in it again. It's just deep, honest, raw, beautiful, heartbreaking, passionate...I love knowing how writing this book helped heal her after her experiences, because simply reading it helped heal some of mine.I'll leave you with one of my favourites...i want to apologise to all the womeni have called pretty.before i've called them intelligent or brave.i am sorry i made it sound as thoughsomething as simple as what you're born withis the most you have to be proud ofwhen your spirit has crushed mountainsfrom now on i will say things like, you are resilientor, you are extraordinary.not because i don't think you're pretty.but because you are so much more than that"
224,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120198641-la-crosse-county-library,Rating 4 out of 5,"Milk and Honey is the first book of poetry I've read by Rupi Kaur. I really enjoyed this one, even if it dealt with difficult subjects, such as abuse, trauma, and recovery. Whatever form of writing you engage in, you are making yourself vulnerable to the reader. It is very clear that Kaur is putting herself out there in this poignant and beautiful volume. All of the poems really resonated with me, featuring messages of hope after suffering trauma and learning to love yourself in all your imperfections. I think the one that resonated the most with me is:


I don't know what living a balanced life feels likeWhen I am sadI don't cry I pourWhen I am happyI don't smile I glowWhen I am angryI don't yell I burnThe good thing about feeling in extremes isWhen I love I give them wingsBut perhaps that isn'tSuch a good thing causeThey always tend to leaveAnd you should see meWhen my heart is brokenI don't grieveI shatter


Why those lines resonated the most with me I think is that we all experience powerful emotions as human beings, and we aren't always able to optimally regulate our expression of them, whether we're dealing with mental illness or grief. Or stress or just having a bad day. Moreover, I think some people see expressions of valid emotions as overbearing and improper, which can be frustrating for the person feeling them. Additionally, I have been told that I am a very sensitive person. I tend to feel things deeply, and this poem gave voice to the very real double-edged sword that can be when trying to be yourself and interacting with the rest of the world. The amazing thing about poetry is that so few words can evoke such powerful feelings in readers. For example, emptiness on a page can evoke feelings of sadness and hollowness. That the writer only has the strength to pen these few words, but still want to get their voice out there and heard. (Well, at least for me. I'm not sure how others interpret poetry--how many words on the page, how they are arranged, etc.)In my opinion, Milk and Honey makes accessible to readers complex themes and ideas animating much larger novels in so much fewer words. And that kind of conciseness of language is just as beautiful as detailed or flowery prose. -CoraFind this book and other titles within our catalog."
225,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18333933-klinta,Rating 2 out of 5,"Full Review.A friend of mine wrote an excellent review, go read it here.I had heard so much about this book that I simply had to read it and now am battling myself about writing a proper review, but will see, I might update this one later. Poetry is not just a sentence divided into random places, so it would look good on paper or look like poetry. And these 'poems' seem just like a big scam where people are tricked into believing that they understand it, while in reality there's nothing to not understand, because there's no mystery, everything's spelt out. Which is unlike any other poems I have read. It seems a bit like basically a smart, deep thought or aphorism was just scattered in few lines and called poetry. Some things in this book mattered to me, things I liked and could relate to. Some things that touched topics, I've pushed deep in my memory, but most things I just frowned upon.I believe that if the parts would have been scattered differently in this book, I would have liked it more because the feminism part was shit. Obviously the author has problems with people telling her to shave (cause it was mentioned three times), which might be a problem is some culture's, with different rights for women, but I somehow think that even with that argument in mind, there are some more noble rights to fight about, like I don't know... choosing who you should marry and stuff? No matter what I say though, I know that people 'who generally don't like poetry' will admit that they like this book because it's just deep sentences with no hidden meanings, and no need to interpret anything put together. The thing is though that I generally like poetry and this wasn't it.It's like the author wanted to put her soul into a novel, but didn't really know how to write it, so she just wrote core sentences and parts and scattered them inside of novel sized and shaped object."

227,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151834275-evoli,Rating 1 out of 5,"The topics being raised in this book were (and still are) of major importance. The words are chosen wisely and the layout is simple, yet really neat and elegant. One can observe that the concept has been thought through carefully.The disturbing part was the writing style. This whole book felt like going through a collection of pretty quotes and meaningful sentences, separated with an enter key into different lines to turn the quotes into poetry. Just beautifully composed sentences being split up into many short rows/lines to stretch the quote (instead of just writing it short manner, in normal and typical or usual lines).Additionally, the lack of punctuation conveyed a certain feeling of the text being “unfinished”, which I personally did not find convincing or logical. If the author’s intent was to make us see these texts as her “streams of thoughts”, just sharing what crosses one’s mind, or as some sort of brainstorming, the sophisticated and elaborate language of the philosophical and linguistically refined texts makes one realise that these, in fact, were rather time-consuming to formulate. I am not going to say that it felt like skimming through “inspirational” Instagram or Tumblr quotes, since I do think that “Milk and Honey” raises important general themes, illustrates more insightful thoughts and the afore mentioned overall concept is evident. However, it did feel like a collection of pretty quotes or sentences and not like poetry. To sum up, I do think that such a style is a matter of taste and preferences of each reader. Some will adore it and some won’t."

I finished it yesterday before bed... I got to say, the author is very brave, she shares with us very intimate details about her childhood, parents, rape, therapy, love affairs, falling in love, sexual encounters, and dealing with breakups. I salute her honesty!Though it had some great quotes, I found her unabashedly honest voice at times shameless and insolent, not too poetic at all, especially of how conservative her life previously was.

230,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38672507-caroline,Rating 4 out of 5,"MODERN poetry isn't for everyone. A lot of the time I love it but it can easily be hit and miss. My main reason for loving Milk and Honey is that I believe there is a lot of power in saying something big with very few words. There were some poems in here that hit really hard, they packed the punch that modern poetry should. Actually there is one poem in here that I found weirdly empowering and beautiful... I think it might be one of my new favourites which is always nice.I enjoyed reading this. It was a nice experience. I do have to say though that some of the poems felt a little... same same. It was as though a number of the poems were saying the same thing and instead of hammering a message home or making it more powerful I just found it annoyingly repetitive. Overall I really liked it. Some great poems in here! Highly recommend if you enjoy modern poetry :)"

Lo primero que tengo que decir es que no soy nada fan de la poesía actual, puede que no sepa apreciarla, pero lo siento, no es lo mío. Pero había oído cosas increíbles de este poemario así que, me adentré en él para ver si este si llegaba a conquistarme... y ya os adelanto que no. Si ha aprobado es por los temas que trata, y porque la última parte me ha gustado mucho, pero el resto de ""poemas"" (cómo me duele llamarlos así, para mí NO LO SON. El verso libre para mí no es poesía. ¿Prosa poética? Es que no. Es prosa escrita en verso y ya), no me han llegado, ni me han dolido, ni conmovido, ni me han producido el más mínimo sentimiento... que sin duda es lo que buscaba la autora al escribirlo. También he de decir que soy partidaria de leer este tipo de escritos en su idioma original, y yo lo he leído traducido... así que estoy segura de que cierta magia se ha perdido por el camino. ¿Lo recomiendo? Sí. Puede que os guste mil veces más que a mí. ¿Es lo mejor que vais a leer? No. Pero tampoco está tan mal como lo pinto yo. Trata temas feministas, temas peliguados que pueden interesaros, pero para mí, no ha sido la mejor manera de contarlos. "

(funny, because my mother has gushing over how amazing rupi kaur is for the past few years.) this final portion was what fulfilled the feeling of wary ""something-seems-a-bit-off-here"" i had been experiencing throughout this read, which brings us to... THE BAD i may be contradicting myself a bit here, but the ending made cringe a little internally. whether intentionally or not, it felt a bit empty and preachy. if i wanted to be showered upon with aesthetically decorated words of hollow encouragement left softened for the wide appeal and disguised under a facade of depth and internalism, i could just open instagram, where i would inevitably be greeted by hordes of 7th-graders reposting slides with vaguely feministic words - 10 of these words, max -embossed on a minimalistic background to seem cultured and wise beyond their years. (and then they turn around and blabber about how ugly trisha in their science class is.)yes, thank you for sharing this, ""hannah mchaley, class of 26', figure skater, capricorn, @hannahbanana24."" you've totally educated all the incel soccer boys in your class that you seem admittedly quite fond of with this cute lil drawing. what a great effort to provide valid insight and research - oh, wait, you don't really care about feminism and just don't want backlash from those of us who actually do, so you reshare unhelpful things to feel woke! wow. A++!! now go back to your sharing of ""hello kitty says acab uwu"" posts from last summer.NOTE: there's nothing wrong with sharing this stuff if you're doing it with genuine intentions. i reshare that stuff too. it's pretty obvious whether one is being woke or whether one is actually wanting to advocate for these issues. and just like these self-assured 7th graders, many teen girls desperately seeking validation and wokeism flaunt their copy of this novel by carrying it in their arm like a shoulder parrot as they strut through their hallways. feminism isn't always cute and aesthetic - and the first half of this book strongly tackled the dark, ugly side of a woman's life and her drive to feel valued in a world which imposes quite the opposite notion on us. however, you can tell that through her process of writing this, she was seeking a bit of widespread appeal in the end by using statements which she knew would be seen as revolutionary and empowering. i'm not suggesting in the slightest that she's diminishing feminism to an aesthetic, and because of what she's endured in her life, she's been victimized directly by the patriarchy. however, the ending portion of this book felt very cliche and overdone, and whether intentional or not, it was destined to be used as a cute little portion of performative moral advancement by much of the audience consuming it. i'm not blaming the author for how her audience consumes her work, but the generalization in itself made the book fall flat of what it could be and the message it could have brought to the table. the performative use of this novel has soured my taste in it and i felt that all of the aestheticization was blatantly unnecessary.approaching the end, the only poem i really related to was that one about her last name.only because we happen to share the same last name.as for the rating, this book gets 2.75/5 stars from me. knowing my criteria for rating based off of memorability, i frankly forgot what messages were revealed in the book because they were scattered everywhere  through the vast expanse of e m p t i n e s s  and diminished down into an overuse of the enter key and an attempt to be 'aesthetic' final takeaway:  ""my 2021 reading challengeleft me feeling challengedand to fill the empty void of my lacking amount of books herei had to submit to the empty voidof the pages of ""milk and honey""-  the regrets of yet another impulsive libby borrower.   seriously. i made a libby account because i desperately needed to get my numbers up, and what better way to do that than with a short poetry book i can just breeze through in an hour, tops?

Well, what do I say? This book was wildly underwhelming! I had such expectations at the time of picking it up. I thought I was in for a treat but was I wrong. Let’s just say that this is so underwhelming that I wasn’t even bothered to write a decent review for quite a while. But now I am finally getting around to it but honestly speaking, I’d rather pass if not for my OCD!!So, the book is actually divided into multiple sections but there isn’t really a theme to it for doing so. The poems and pieces about anything are placed just about anywhere. And a lot of them are stated in a very questionable way and are debate worthy bcz they are pretty open to interpretation. I found myself not agreeing to a few of the pieces.While reading this book I found another problem that isn’t just limited to this book but is applicable to a lot of such poetry books. The problem is that none of these books have even a single negative poem. You know how they are all loving and pure and full of insight and teaching? I wonder why none of them deal with any of the more human emotions like anger or hate or vengefulness or jealousy or anything like that for the matter. Why are they all so shiny white? Why aren’t they about how a real person hurts? Where is the black? The grey? In these terms, I think The road of us was much better, although AFTER publishing my review for that book I realized what a phony, lousy and shallow person the author is in real life which kinda ruined the book for me completely. Every poetry book I have ever read till date talks about “loving yourself first before anyone else” in one way or the other and they all shun the idea of someone completing another person. How and why is that wrong? Why are the authors trying to sell us the idea that nobody is capable of loving us apart from ourselves? Where did all the notions of love and soulmate go to? How come self love is the only thing left? And why do none of these books talk about a person who is incapable of loving themselves? Oh sure, they preach that yeah girl, love yourself but why do none of them talk about a person who just can’t do that? Is the idea of a person who can never truly love themselves so impossible? Is the idea of someone coming in your life and giving you a love that you couldn’t give to yourself so abhorrent? Most of all, why do these books sound like they are preaching? I mean let me ask, all these authors being as young as they are (most in their mid to late twenties), how come they have seen most everything in life? And alright fine they might have the knowledge but how and why do all these authors sound like the angels descended to the Earth to write these books bcz dammit why do they have no negative emotions? And why do the essence of all these insta-poetry books is limited to ""YASS QUEEN""?? Building up only women? Where is the raw & real side of everything that poetry is supposed bring?Yeah, I find it EXTREMELY phoney, the way these authors write and it doesn’t sit well with me.

I saw some reviews which were pretty fitting so maybe you can just read other 3-4* reviews because they also didn't give her 5* because the ""what the effing is she try to tell us"".Yeah, she has some powerful things in here but also some things which didn't feel correct to me as a person. Like fighting with your lover and then having sex and everything is fine is not how it should work.Oh and just hitting the enter button doesn't make it a poem.Some of those where actually nice and I enjoyed reading this book and some of the doodles too. She's honest but you can also see that she is, in my opinion, not stable when it comes to relationships and I mean that's okay, it's her book and her heart she offered us and I think she didn't expect that her book will make it to New York's #1 and she will have this impact on so many people.Kaur has some pretty strong, emotional and mostly honest things in here and I have to admit that some of them touched me personally and well I think this is great enough! :)Read from August 3 2018 till August 7 but not added to my reading year since I don't count this as a whole book."
260,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35274710-n-a,Rating 2 out of 5,"To begin with, I would like to point out that this was a beneath the average book. It wasn't even unconventional poetry but rather bits of scribbling and illustrations on some pages. The idea was present there but it was scattered and fragmented all over the book. The author doesn't explore those ideas and hence, they remain underdeveloped! The book has a potential but in my opinion that potential hasn't been stretched to its highest. I've watched Rupi performing slang poems and she is absolutely amazing at that. I suggest you to watch Rupi's Ted Talks. The few longest paragraphs in this book would make a beautiful and heart-touching slang poem if Rupi was to perform it on stage. However, she could have worked more on this book and make her ideas more concrete. If you want to read this book, I encourage you to do so even if I gave it a 2 stars because the author presents some beautiful ideas. To end with, I would like to leave you with this beautiful quote from the book: ""how is it so easy for you to be kind to people he asked milk and honey dripped from my lips as i answered cause people have not been kind to me."""

“if you were born with the weakness to fallyou were born with the strength to rise”

Milk and Honey es un libro muy especial. Generalmente no suelo leer poesía, pero me llamó mucho la atención la popularidad que tiene esta novela. Ahora lo entiendo porque también me ha encantado. Es una obra con una escritura muy hermosa. Es un libro muy hermoso y emotivo con temas muy reales como: el trauma, el desamor, la infelicidad, la soledad o la incapacidad de aceptarse a uno mismo. 

“the idea that we are so capable of love but still choose to be toxic”

La autora divide la obra en cuatro partes, aunque más bien son como etapas de la vida. Y a través de cada una de ellas te guía por pequeñas historias que te rompen el corazón. A mí me sucedió. Me sentí muy conectada desde el inicio, y no porque haya experimentado un corazón roto o algún trauma, sino porque creo que Rupi Kaur hizo un trabajo fantástico para plasmar palabras que nos hicieran sentir. Hay muchos pasajes que me ame. Creo que cada poema tiene poder, incluso, el más corto. 

“i am hopelessly a lover anda dreamer andthat will be thedeath of me”

Al leer la obra, pude sentir que estaba viviendo cada una de las etapas y fue como un golpe. Creo que si me hubiera sentido identificada, hubiera sido realmente devastador. Porque sí, estamos hablando de un libro tan devastador como hermoso. Al final, casi se podría decir que con un final feliz, pero creo que eso depende más de cada persona que lo lea. 

“if you are not enoughfor yourself you will never be enough for someone else”

Por otro lado, el arte de las ilustraciones me pareció muy adecuado. Es real, simple y directo, aunque no es perfecto ni el más bonito. Y no necesita ser perfecto o bonito porque de eso no se trata la obra. Me gusto mucho porque sentí que combinaba con la historia que Kaur estaba construyendo. 

“how you love yourself ishow you teach othersto love you”

En conclusión, me alegro de haber leído este pequeño libro. Me parece una de esas ocasiones en las que no sabes que necesitabas algo pero, cuando lees algo maravilloso, lo encuentras. "

picture to urlHer passion and her love for poems tears me. I actually connected with them and went with the flow. It may not exactly seem like poetry to some. Maybe it’s not exactly poetry but they do the work of what poems exist for. I really love this book. It brings out the wonderful sexist side and vulgarity of the humans. And omg the pictures!!! They express a whole new different type of emotions.I can’t really write much about this book because some things you have to find out yourself. Some things speak out only to you not the others. And to that, you must read and find out. You have to figure it out yourself. That’s what healing is. Figure yourself out!"

Auch wenn einige Gedichte sehr stark waren, war der Großteil leider eher fad und schwach. Ein Großteil der Gedichte handelt von Missbrauch und Schmerz; vor allem war ich nicht darauf vorbereitet direkt in den ersten Seiten auf Missbrauch/Vergewaltigung zu stoßen. Der letzte Kapitel stellt eine Sammlung von Texten dar, die das Heilungsprozess beschreiben, allerdings fand ich diese zu simpel im Gegensatz zu den anderen Teilen des Buches. (...) ich bin gegangen weil ichje länger ich bei dir bliebdesto weniger mich selbst liebteIch denke, dass jeder, der von der Liebe enttäuscht wurde oder sich in einer Beziehung trennen musste, sich hier irgendwo wieder finden wird. Ich gehe davon aus, dass das Buch auch auf Frauen abgezielt ist. Trotz der einfachen Sprache und der freien Form fand ich die meisten Gedichte ansprechend formuliert, aber manche waren dann doch zu einfach. Da hätte man die schwächeren Gedichte aussortieren sollen. Ich persönlich fand auch, dass die Illustrationen in den ersten Seiten nicht so gut waren wie zum Ende.

I am unable to read books that talk about that and I wish people would have told me before I started it. However, the whole message beside the book is really beautiful and I was able to read the whole thing!I know that this kind of poetry can be judged as too easy since it's sometimes only a quick and simple sentence, but since a lot of them actually touched me I think that this book was really good. Poetry is here to make us feel things and that's what happened with Milk and Honey. So it's good enough for me! Also, the illustrations were absolutely gorgeous and I wanted to take pics of everyone of them.The messages in this book are really important and even though I already knew everything, I think it's great that the author wrote them. Poetry can touch so many people and I know that a lot of people need to hear those words.

This was such a beautiful collection of poems. I don't usually read poems, in fact this is probably the first poetry book I own. I've read very few poems, but I kept stumbling upon this book over and over so I finally decided to read it. And I am so glad that I did! The poems are so well written, and the best thing about it is that everyone can relate to it. The poems are broken into four parts - hurt, love, pain, and healing, shows every phase of life through these strong, and beautifully written poems.The poems are written in a very simple way, but the message it gives, the impact it has is  very strong. I couldn't relate to some parts, like the hurt, where the subject was too dark and heavy, but still there were some poems which really touched my heart. But rest of the three parts were beautiful, some parts which I could completely relate to, and the last part which was very inspirational and uplifting.

This book by Rupi Kaur containing poetry, prose is divided into four parts:●The hurting (About the women & child abuse)●The loving (About the on going relationship)●The breaking (Oh..the breakup comes)●The healing (Getting normal in regular life)But I would better call them some status updates on the social media, they don't look like what I think poems are. They were like: someone is sharing own thoughts about own love-life & other things in a random way. Moreover, the use of no capitalization & punctuation marks at all made me more annoyed. It didn't work for me actually. It also contains illustrations by Rupi.Since the weather was gentle & airy, I had fixed my mind for a book of poetry. Hence, I randomly took this one for spending the peaceful day. This one got my eyes because of its cute title.

Poezija? Ovo nije poezija. Ovo su nabacane riječi bez imalo ljepote i stila i dubine i ičega. Dopire li išta do mene? Nimalo. Previše sam toga pročitala da bi me nešto ovako loše moglo dodirnuti. Ovo je kao kad otvoriš fanfiction koji možda ima tvoju najdražu temu, ali osoba ne zna pisati i samo prevrćeš očima. Ovo mi čak nema nimalo dragu temu pa onda preokrećem očima dvostruko i sjetivši se svih pjesnika koje sam pročitala, sve one ljepote jezika i prelijevanje slika koje se onda stapaju u novu sliku i izrastaju u nešto novo. One pjesnike koji najružnije stvari mogu prikazati tako prekrasno i predivno.I onda ovo. Ovo je Fifthy Shades of Gray svijeta poezije. A dijelovi ove zbirke su... htjela sam reći na granici, ali nisu na granici... upravo pornografski. Naglasimo žensku seksualnost i gluparije. A nego čija je seksualnost naglašena u današnjem svijetu nego ženska? Kakve poruke dobivaju današnje djevojke? Reći ću vam: poruke da morate izgubiti djevičanstvo do 18. godine najdalje inače ste ružne, nepoželjne i nenormalne; poruke da se stalno morate osjećati napadnuto ako vam onda netko slučajno prigovori zbog promiskuitetnog ponašanja; poruke da mora biti u redu promijeniti tri tone muških budući da to ionako muški rade. Odvratno. Ova odvratna knjiga je samo još jedna u nizu slika ovog degradirajućeg društva.Onda vrhunska ljubav koja se ovdje prikazuje, ljubav koja nije ljubav i koju nam serviraju u serijama i onim jadnim ljubavnim romanima. E ako je to ljubav, ja ću dovijeka biti sama, jer se neću degradirati na te razine, na glupe trenutke seksualnog užitka i pokojeg izlaska. Prokleti feminizam današnji, još jednom.Ne želim ni spominjati koliko neke ""pjesme"" podsjećaju na dijelove nekih drugih, popularnih pjesama, koliko neke liče na prosječan tumblr post, koliko neke nalikuju na one patetične facebook statuse. Patetika bez zvuka i melodije i tona. To nije poezija.Na trenutke kao da vidim one glupe serije gdje netko vara nekoga i onda: ali nikad je nećeš voljeti kao mene! Ili: nikad ti neće biti ono što sam ti ja bila.Ženo, okani se poezije, hajde piši te glupe američke serije koje nisam pogledala već deset godina.I da, kad već psuješ, koja je to glupa fora sa ***. Sad si se odjednom sjetila biti pristojna kao? Ajde molim te...Zašto sam se natjerala da ovo čitam drugi put? Je li se to pojavila nada nakon onog jada od ""Princess saves herself this time"" da bi ovo moglo biti išta bolje? Ovo je ista stvar, još jedan prikaz propadanja ovog našeg jadnog društva. Pogledajmo što je bio šund prije sto godina, to je danas remek djelo. Do sada bar nije postojao ovaj pravi, popularni šund u poeziji, ali eto, stiže nam i u tome nova era iz vrlih zemalja SAD-a i Kanade.I ako malo pogledate, nadam se, moja zadnja misao ovog osvrta, ovdje su muškarci prikazani kao tek poenka ptica koja eto sleti na tvoj prozor i donese ti malo zadovoljstva, a sve se kupa u egoizmu i uživljavanju u vlastiti spol. Oprosti, mi žene možemo biti jednako pokvarene kao i muškarci, a iz moga iskustva, i daleko gore."

I understand there has been a rise in ‘modern-contemporary’ poems, or ‘tumblr-speak.’ From what I’ve seen people either love or hate it.I personally really enjoyed it. I’m by no means a poetry connoisseur but I believe poetry should be a very personal thing. I care little about the formatting and more about the words themselves. For me, poetry is always a hard thing to review because it is so personal, so this is going to be short and simplePros:This addresses some really powerful and harrowing topics I believe are very relevant to women today. Again, very personal to even read and I think Rupi Kaur managed to convey of difficult ideas and emotions in very short worksI liked the variety both in length and style with the poems and I thought the illustrations fit very well.A strong theme of self-confidence and finding strength in one’s self ran throughout this entire collection—each section builds upon it until it cultivates in the last fourth. Overall, I think it’s a very important message and I enjoyed the way it was handled. Cons:This did get a little repetitive. The collection is split into four sections and I couldn’t help but feel like perhaps each section was a little longer than it needed to be. Beautiful words, just conveying thoughts that had already been expressed several times. In Conclusion: Powerful stuff, just felt a little repetitive in places!"
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35614518-chesca-thecrownedpages,Rating 3 out of 5,"Actual Rating: 2.5 starsI was so excited to read Rupi Kaur’s 
Milk and Honey
 because the blurb and the reviews I’ve seen all promised me a great read. I’m sorry, but I don’t think it deserved the huge hype.I admit that Kaur is a bold and very honest writer. This was her truth in the pages and I greatly appreciated that she spoke about all the hurt, the beauty, and how to endure life’s cruelties. It was as if she was holding my heart in her hand and squeezing it.But the writing wasn’t that impressive. I didn’t like the idea that every line in the poems started in lowercase letters. Also, her choice of words weren’t that exquisitely weaved. They were too simple for my liking. The concepts of most of the poems were things that you could’ve easily read from Facebook pages and tumblr posts. They seemed unoriginal and derivative.Here’s an example:
“sex takes the consent of twoif one person is lying there not doing anythingcause they are not readyor not in the moodor simply don't want toyet the other is having sexwith their body it's not loveit is rape”
Despite my negative views on it, I admit that this is a good book to read when you’re feeling down and are in need of a friend. It reminded me to look at life as a canvas filled with colors and textures that would uplift you or agitate you."

I wish I enjoyed this as much as everybody else, however I found this collection quite underwhelming. I might not be a modern poetry kind of person, who knows.

Me encantó la poesía de Rupi Kaur porque no es llana y pretenciosa como esas típicas frases de tumblr que pretenden ser poéticas. Ella realmente es profunda con lo que plantea y se nota que lo ha pensado y trabajado bastante. Muestra de dónde provienen sus ideas y las va desarrollando a lo largo del libro de una forma fantástica. Habla de temas muy importantes, como las raíces propias, violaciones, y la necesidad que quererse a uno mismo. Y la estructura que separa al libro en cuatro partes me gustó mucho porque enfatiza los momentos en que la autora pensaba una o aquella cosa y son momentos de la vida por los que la mayoría pasamos. Es muy crudo en muchos aspectos (y por lo que se llega a saber de Rupi Kaur, está claro que ha tenido una vida bastante complicada, así que esa crudeza está justificada y tiene bastante sentido). Es muy explícita con respecto al sexo, algo que a mí me incomodó más de una vez (because I'm such a prude), pero lo entiendo perfectamente por lo que le tocó vivir y porque entre las ideas que defiende está eso de romper tabúes (y claro, el sexo es uno de ellos). El libro es absolutamente feminista y hubo muchas cosas al respecto que me encantaron, pero hubo un par de otras que no mucho; y es precisamente porque yo no termino de encajar con el feminismo de hoy en día. Siento que hay un culto al cuerpo bastante innecesario. Que sí, que las mujeres podemos ir por ahí como se nos pegue en gana y no por eso los acosadores deben sentirse en el derecho de perseguirnos. Es completamente cierto. Pero luego hay nimiedades sobre si es nuestro derecho dejarnos el vello de las piernas o si los hombres pueden andar sin camisa nosotras también. Y en fin, que hay cosas más urgentes en las que centrarse; por ejemplo: las relaciones tóxicas, las canciones machistas, la educación que enseña a las niñas desde pequeñas que su rol en la sociedad consiste en estar casada, tener hijos y contentar a su marido, y que tenemos que saber cocinar para él y lavar y planchar y todas esas cosas. Y además está el hecho de que el nuevo feminismo es también bastante cruel con el género masculino. Nos centramos en los estereotipos que rodean a la mujer, pero olvidamos que el hombre también sufre de ellos. Después de todo, ellos son los violadores, los acomodados que esperan la cena caliente sin mover un dedo, los que nos pegan e insultan, los que se creen superiores, los que se burlan de nosotras por ser sensibles y superficiales, los que tienen que mantenernos porque somos inútiles. Pero eso es cuestión de tradición. A ellos también les enseñaron que no pueden mostrar sus sentimientos ni llorar, que tienen que trabajar para proveer a su familia porque ese es el deber del hombre, que ellos son la cabeza del hogar, que es de campeones acostarse con muchas chicas, que no pueden meterse en la cocina porque eso es para mujeres. La verdad no creo que tengan la culpa, tan sólo les enseñaron a estar en el bando en que hay menos opresión. Y claro, entiendo que la visión de Rupi Kaur sobre los hombres se haya visto bastante mancillada por haber sido violada y por la casi inexistente relación con su padre; pero a veces sentí que estaba demasiado ocupada tratado de convencer a las mujeres de que no era su culpa ser maltratadas por los hombres y no hacía distinciones en que los hombres buenos también existen.Ahora, sí que me encantó el énfasis que le puso a la idea de que lo primero es amarse a uno mismo, tener una buena relación con nosotros, apreciar nuestra soledad y descubrir nuestras virtudes y defectos y aprender a querernos aun así. Es que me parece trascendental sobre todo en estos tiempos en que las niñas andan buscando a alguien que las complete, que sea lo que ellas no son para sentirse llenas porque tienen pánico a quedarse solas. Y así se casan y arruinan sus vidas atándose a alguien, engañándose a sí mismas pensando que los aman, sólo porque les parece una mejor idea que morir en soledad. Ese es el mensaje que más rescato de este poemario: 《fallin love with your solitude》"

297,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57137850-niki,Rating 1 out of 5,"Quick summary of this book's four sections:the hurting: I was abused as a child but I'm only going to mention it in passing for shock value, never delve into it in any capacity (if you didn't want to talk about it, why even mention it?)the loving: sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex, did I mention I'm having sexthe breaking: Welp, looks like the only thing we had in common was sexthe healing: pseudo-feminist ""you are a goddess"" ""other women are SISTERS even though I dissed them in the breaking"" ""you shouldn't HAVE to shave"" bullshitNeedless to say, this book did nothing for me. Not only are pages and pages wasted for stuff likethe idea that we areso capable of lovebut still chooseto be toxicor you were temptingly beautifulbut still stung when I got closeorit must hurt to knowi am your mostbeautifulregretor, my personal favourite,the night after you lefti woke up so brokenthe only place to put the pieceswere the bags under my eyes (did the author steal that from one of her high school journals?),but the author also contradicts herself directly. At least two of poems in the breaking are about ""every other woman after me will be a cheap bootleg, you'll be with her but you'll be thinking of ME"" (wow), but then, in the healing, she's all about ""other women are SISTERS, I cannot believe you told me I'm not like other girls, that was so offensive, women should be supporting each other"" Then there's a poem about periods that mentions ""it is okay to sell what's/ between a woman's legs/ more than it's okay to/ mention its inner workings"" when the entirety of the loving is about having sex and her boyfriend going down on her, in detail (example: ""like your mouth has the gift of reading and i'm your favourite book. find your favourite page in the soft spot between my legs and read it carefully. fluently. vividly. don't you dare leave a single word untouched."") Kinda hypocritical? Am I missing something?? Nobody's perfect and I didn't expect Rupi Kaur to be, but this book is so highly acclaimed I expected something better than this.Lastly, an honourable mention goes to the obligatory ""It's not about getting famous, that's clearly why I decided to publish the book and make money off of it, because I didn't care about getting recognition and money"" poem at the end. Yeah, right, Rupi.Some of the prose and longer poems were kinda good, but they only made up 5-10% of the book, and they were still nothing revolutionary or incredibly beautiful. Highly overhyped."

A few words can have an impact and make you feel so much. If anyone has any recommendations, comment or message me. I'm all for exploring!
'how is it so easy for youto be kind to people he askedmilk and honey drippedfrom my lips as i answeredcause people have notbeen kind to me'
I realised that I have a preference to deep dark poetry. Dark thoughts and experiences. I enjoy reading about people's experiences, it's like all this anger, sadness and pain being scratched onto the pages.Its a part of the author and I can't get enough of that.
 'neither of us is happybut neither of us wants t leaveso we keep breaking one anotherand calling it love' 
Rupi Kaur just has a way with words, I can't even explain it.She inspires me to write.Even though I am no poet but her poetry makes me want to give it a shot.It's a whole different experience when you read something and you can totally relate and you feel like the words are your words that you never knew how to express.This is one I would definitely want on my shelf because I don't this is the last time I will read it.
'I can't tell if my mother isterrified or in love with myfather it all looks the same' 
I pretty much highlighted the whole book. I just couldn't stop myself!Just beautiful and I can't wait for more by this author.Blog: http://zakirrahsbookblog.blogspot.co.uk/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ZakirrahsBoo...Twitter: https://twitter.com/ZBookBlog"

Bu kitabı çok sevdim çünkü şiirler çok net, vurucu ve hüzünlü. Yazar anlatmak istediklerini fazladan hiçbir kelime kullanmadan çok açık bir dille ve oldukça cesur bir şekilde anlatmış. Ve kitabı bu kadar çok sevme nedenlerimden birisi de Rupi Kaur'un cesareti oldu.

Kitabı seven kadar sevmeyen de çıkacak, bunu okurken fazlasıyla düşündüm. Rupi Kaur'un dili bazı insanları rahatsız da edecektir. Ama ben kesinlikle bayıldım. Şiirlerdeki hüznü okuyucuya geçirme konusunda çok başarılı olduğunu düşünüyorum. Aşk, travma, taciz, cinsellik, kadın üzerine oldukça vurucu şiirler barındıran bir kitap Süt ve Bal. Benim tavsiyemdir. İçindeki şiirlerin bir kısmına göz gezdirip size hitap edeceğine karar verirseniz eğer mutlaka kütüphanenizde bulundurun derim.

It’s been awhile since I read a poetry collection which is weird because I always love reading (and writing) poems/prose. I knew already that I’ll end up loving milk and honey right after I read the first page. I love everything about this book. The cover, illustrations and words. They’re so perfect. Most of my favorites are from the loving and healing chapters. This book reminds us to love ourselves first before anyone or anything else. Such a powerful and inspiring read."

Each chapter focused on honest descriptions of what it means to be a woman, and to be human. While the focus of this book is on women's lived experience, there is enough insight and beauty here for everyone. I read some pages three and  four times, because I had to digest all of the wonderful elements they entailed. The illustrations are minimalist but compliment the words, leaving enough space for you to fill in the rest.

Mezclar temas en un solo poemario de secuencia es un claro ejemplo de que no tenía suficientes poemas de un tema en específico para sacar un libro en concreto, así que lo más factible fue enlazar la vida personal, problemas familiares, promoción del feminismo, frases de tumblr y pensamientos filosóficos con nudos flojos, adivinen, NO FUNCIONÓ.""Poemas"" con poca profundidad, hechos para alabar la cotidianidad y tocar los sentimientos de una forma universal, puras cosas de Tumblr. Para rematar, lo que les diré es en serio, en un ochenta por ciento del libro no hay poemas, no, no los hay, son cualquiera cosa menos poemas. Esperen, todavía no termino, la verdad no todo es malo, la autora te deja frases maravillosas que podrás usar en una ""necesitada"" ocasión, si, varias frases me gustaron, pero son eso, sólo frases, un poema es más que eso.En conclusión, la autora fuera millonaria si los críticos literarios le pagaran por escribir frases, pero si fuera por escribir poemas, que les puedo decir, hay mucho que mejorar.

This collection isn’t for me, the older, married, hetero guy. While I don’t feel an accusatory finger pointed at me, it’s more an indifferent turning away. Nonetheless it’s reassuringly straightforward in its language, almost blunt. Its use of lower case and clipped short sentences accompanied with simple line drawings are perfect for our internet age and ripe for the inevitable popularity backlash. "
