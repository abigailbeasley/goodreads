0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,Rating 2 out of 5,"All right so this is not the book I thought it was when I got it, and I apologise for a rating that would surely be higher if I were part of the target audience. I was hoping it was a survey of the latest scientific research into arousal disorders and sexuality; in fact, it's a very selective presentation of those pieces of research that are considered helpful in ‘promoting women's sexual well-being, autonomy and pleasure’. Studies, however revealing, which do not promote such things are ignored. In other words, the book is primarily therapy, not science. Perhaps not surprising given that the author is a sex therapist, but I hadn't realised that – I thought she was a researcher.I've been very intentional about the empirical details I've included or excluded. I asked myself, “Does this fact help women have better sex lives, or is it just a totally fascinating and important empirical puzzle?”And I cut the puzzles.This means that, although there is some useful information here, it is interspersed with a lot of rather irritating, vaguely encouraging bullshit about ‘living with confidence and joy inside your body’, reassurances that you are ‘all normal, all beautiful’, and exhortations to ‘listen with your heart, not with your fear’. Naturally as a British passport-holder I cannot read this stuff without feeling my toes clench and my testicles retract into my body, and the narrative tone doesn't help either. Nagoski writes in the earnest, chatty way of someone trying to write a book for people who don't read books, with lots of forcedly colloquial comments like, ‘Wait: what?’ and, ‘For realsie real.’OK, fine, I am clearly not the target audience, I get that, but for me it gets incredibly grating when every hint of scientific information is hedged around with encouragements and stupid metaphors and open condescension: before a section on the hedonic centres of the mesolimbic cortex (which Nagoski calls ‘your emotional One Ring’), she warns, ‘It gets pretty nerdy here […] Ready? Okay’, and afterwards pats us on the head by asking, ‘Did you make it? Phew! That was the hard part. Nice job.’ Gee thanks, Dr Nagoski!Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium—and for those of you who very understandably just fell asleep, replace that with the song “The Origin of Love” from John Cameron Mitchell's Hedwig and the Angry Itch—offers this parable about why humans love…Really? What I found so infuriating about all this is the implied gendering of her tone – it's somehow pitched at a certain idea of women, as though they have no interest in hard science and need their research presented in the form of a Cosmo quiz. It's really outrageous; I don't know if I should be taking it as some reflection on the state of US science education, but the total horror of any scientific terminology, combined with the girlfriends-chatting-over-a-Manhattan tone, just left a really bad taste in the mouth. (Men come off no better – Nagoski writes that she has to ‘translate the science of women's sexual well-being into Manly Fix-It Dude-Speak’ to talk to her clients' partners….)The reason this is so frustrating is that the actual research presented is pretty important and, in some cases, not so well known. The two presiding ideas in the book, I think, are the concept of responsive v. spontaneous desire, and the dual control model of sexual arousal. The terms ‘responsive desire’ and ‘spontaneous desire’ have been floating around for over a decade now – I think the key paper was Basson et al. 2003 (although Nagoski says they were coined by Ellen Laan and Stephanie Both, which may be true; Laan is one of the authors of that paper). The basic idea is that while some people can get turned on while walking down the street or doing the dishes, for others it's something that only happens in response to situations that have already been made explicitly erotic. Arousal first, desire second.The disparity between these different kinds of desire is, of course, behind a lot of relationship stresses, whence Nagoski's clinical interest. For her what's important here is to point out that responsive desire is perfectly OK and is not the same as ‘low desire’.A woman can be perfectly normal and healthy and never experience spontaneous sexual desire. Instead, she may experience ‘responsive’ desire, in which her desire emerges only in a highly erotic context.She writes ‘a woman’ – and there may well be a sex divide. Nagoski estimates (on somewhat shaky data, because research into this is limited) that five percent of men and thirty percent of women have responsive desire, compared with seventy-five percent of men and five percent of women whose desire is ‘spontaneous’. (This leaves most women and twenty percent of men whose desire style changes based on the context – a rather large amount which does slightly throw the whole model into question. Asexuality is not addressed.) Nagoski is understandably worried about the idea that sexual desire which differs from the male norm is pathologised as ‘broken’ or defective in some way, something to be ‘fixed’ by taking a so-far-mythical pill; she wrote an op-ed piece for the New York Times back in February on this subject.It's all good stuff and it's certainly a vocabulary that more people should have at their disposal. However, it should be noted that other models of sexual desire are available. It's also worth saying that all we are really doing here is playing semantics. Thinking about responsive desire as a thing might help people to feel better about themselves and not to feel broken – which is good, and they're not – but it doesn't really say anything about what's actually going on. What affects whether desire is spontaneous or responsive? Hormones? Neurology? Upbringing? Culture?(This semantics issue is something the whole book suffers from – same goes for her long and heartfelt rant about why we do not have a sex ‘drive’ but rather an ‘incentive motivation system’. For the life of me after reading that section several times, I couldn't work out what the difference was supposed to be.) Even more than responsive desire, Nagoski is excited about something called the Dual Control Model of Arousal. This is the idea developed by two researchers at the Kinsey Institute in 2006 (the paper's here) and essentially what it does is to consider libido in terms of those psychosomatic processes that promote sexual arousal, and in terms of those that restrain it. The paper posits a Sexual Excitation System (SES) on the one hand, and a Sexual Inhibition System (SIS) on the other; Nagoski calls them the accelerators and the brakes. The SES is that part of you that constantly scans your thoughts and the world around you for sexually-relevant data; the SIS is – not inhibitions in the layman's sense, but a necessary consideration of negative consequences of any sexual activity, whether medical, social, psychological or whatever.Conceptualising things in this way turns out to add quite a lot of nuance to how we think about arousal. People with arousal problems differ fundamentally in where the issue lies: some have a low SES (i.e. not many things actually turn them on in principle), while others have a very rich SES but just a highly sensitive inhibition system which stops them reacting as fully as they otherwise might, unless conditions are ideal. Similarly, sexual risk-taking like unprotected sex, cheating and so on, is sometimes correlated with low SIS and sometimes with abnormally high SES.Nagoski very sensibly suggests that a prerequisite to overcoming arousal problems is understanding one's own SES and SIS – getting familiar with what exactly it is that turns you on and turns you off, and creating contexts where the former are maximised and the latter minimised. There are lots of interesting studies that bear on these ideas in various ways. It was found, for example, that wearing socks made it easier for women to orgasm while masturbating in a brain imaging machine. This is not because there are more sock fetishists than previously appreciated, but simply because it's distracting if you have cold feet, and depending on your personal SIS little distractions of this kind can add up fast (especially, one presumes, when trying to get off inside a brain imaging machine).It's clear that Nagoski wants to back up her ideas by using interviews with her clients, to demonstrate how helpful these concepts can be. And some interviews like this would indeed have been great – books like Brett Kahr's Sex and the Psyche show how well clinical transcripts can work in books of this kind. But, pleading confidentiality issues, Nagoski instead invents fictional couples who she says are composites of the many people she has treated in real life, and the book is interspersed with transcripts of how these fictional people were fictionally treated. Reading these made-up conversations with made-up couples, who nod and gasp appropriately at all her revelations, is an exercise in pure frustration.There were times when I wanted to throw this book across the room, and it's only thanks to the good fortune that I was reading it on my iPad that I was forced to press on. Nevertheless, there are small parts of it that I'd like to cut out and circulate to everyone I know, so it is an odd mix. Parts of the book, I mean, not my iPad. Nagoski is after all basically coming from the right place and talking about the right things, and she's not afraid of making some big claims for her field either.Do I think that living with confidence and joy and respecting everyone's sexual autonomy could play a role in preventing cancer, solving the climate crisis, or building world peace? Yes, actually.No way I can one-star a book saying something as close to my heart as that. And I guess if what you want is something therapeutic rather than just informative, then this will fit the bill pretty well. Still, despite all the interesting material to be uncovered in here, it is hard to shake off the vague feeling that you're getting a lecture on sexual dysfunction from a children's television presenter.(Oct 2015)"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/702266-jennie,Rating 3 out of 5,"The information in this book is solid gold. A copy should be put in the hands of every person, ideally before they've had sexual contact with another person. But. BUT. The metaphors. Dear Lord, the metaphors. We have sexuality as an accelerator and brakes, sexuality as an overgrown garden, sexuality as a hot water heater, complex feelings as a sleeping hedgehog, sexual interest as a customers seeking a diner, sexual expectations as a touchy monitor tapping her fingernails, our brains as a flock of birds, and SO MANY OTHERS I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER. I understand and applaud what Nagoski is doing in terms of wanting to convey big complicated cognitive functions in more relatable prose. But it touches a nerve for me when writers anthropomorphize female sexuality. I find it infantilizing. I'm a big girl, just tell me what my brain is doing, I can read about chemicals and neurons and whatnot. I don't need to imagine my brain as a lion and my pelvis as a caveman or whatever other nonsense. So 5 stars for the content, 4 stars for the chatty conversational writing style (which did not annoy me but will probably polarize some readers) and 1 star for the overworked metaphors. "
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25493797-khurram,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ok, when I saw the tile of this book, it thought probably what everyone else thought about this book. (Ok, the introduction and chapter 8 and appendix one might be, but the rest is science over myth), If it did not come, it was highly recommended from a respected friend of mine from uni. I probably would not ever give it the first look. Read is as some ""light reading"" doing her PhD. in Psychology. So, of course, she decided to experiment with her friend to get a male perspective on the book. So let me get this out of the way first. No!! This is not a collection of sex stories. There are actual case studies. They are not written to be provocative but to understand the feeling of the accelerators and the breaks.Thought Emily does quote a number of scientific theories and is by her own admission a ""nerd"" (no judgement I have been a proud geek for years), you do not have to be to understand the book, it is written in an easy to read way. I found there is a lot of truth to this book, and even though it is written primarily for women in mind I think both me men and women can lean a lot from it and will see traits of both in the case studies.I also think there are some very important messages in this book, the main one being the first like and echoed throughout the book ""You are OK."" You are normal. You are not broken. "" Usually, whenever we do not fit the mould or something does not live up out our expectations, one of those three thoughts does through our heads. the other messages that she tries to show us are the messages we are bombarded with through out our lives the ""that is wrong"", ""you should look like this"", or ""that is not normal"". I quite like the idea of celebrating differences and then persecuting people for them.This is a great book with a lot of insightful theories and science against myth and breaking down some pretty big walls. theories of sex and psychology have been linked since Sigmund Freud. As some theories have moved on others, we still have so much to learn about in others. It is a great book that should be read by everyone and commented on what you agree with or disagree with."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22189348-adina,Rating 4 out of 5,"An excellent book about women physiology and the psychology of sexual arousal and pleasure. It uses the latest scientific discoveries about women sexuality to debunk some myths and to try to improve life between the sheets. I read it for the science because you can never now enough about the subject and I was not disappointed. The bottom line of the book is that women physiology and sexuality was viewed, explained and criticized from men’s lens and standards. As the author clearly explains, women are very different.I will leave you with some interesting bits of wisdom. -	Male and female sex parts are the same but arranged differently. The correspondent of the pleasure organ, aka the penis, is the clitoris, not the vagina as many might think. As a result, the majority of women can only have orgasm by the stimulation of the clit. It is no wonder then that 75% of women never orgasm or rarely. -	responsive v. spontaneous desire, Basically, some people can get turned on randomly while for others it only happens in response to highly erotic situations. 75% of men and 5% of women have spontaneous desires. 30% of women have only responsive desire and the rest change depending on the context. Well, she talks a lot about context and here things get a bit blurry-	she talks about the existence of Dual Control Model of Arousal which consist in a Sexual Excitation System (SES) –accelerators and Sexual Inhibition System (SIS) – breaks. Each woman has a various degree of both and there is a large chapter about how to identify your mix and how to adjust the SES and SIS to improve your sex life. Context again is very important.-	It talks a lot about how stress influences the sex life, not a surprise here I guess, but she does it quite well. -	Arousal non-concordance, a concept I did not know and it is very important especially in context of violence towards women. Apparently, you can get wet/erect without being aroused because the brain tells to your genitals that there is a sexual context. An important example is with rape victims who are mistakenly thought to be enjoying themselves because of this involuntary reaction. Emily Nagoski is sex therapist and the book is written as a form of therapy. The main focus is to make the reader feel normal and confident with her body and sexuality which is great but it can also be tiring because of many repetitions. The tone is very chatty and informal; it felt like reading a Cosmo article. There were lots of laughable (to me) similes trying to better explain some concepts. I somehow felt that the author tried too hard to make the concepts accessible and because of that it appeared like she was writing to dumb child."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community,No Rating,"It’s hard not to love a book with a pseudo-vagina on the front; it’s even harder not to love that same book for smashing all the preconceived ideas we have about female (and by comparison, male) sexuality. Like, for example, did you know that the hymen as an indication of virginity is entirely a social construction and there is no scientific evidence backing it? Using actual, real science, Dr. Emily Nagoski – a speak-the-truth-and-only-the-truth sex educator/professor – breaks down all the things we think we know about sex and desire and drive and, in the process, makes you feel like not are you normal, but we’re ALL normal. As she says over and over and over, “We’re all made up of the same basic parts, just organized differently.” In other words, there is no normal. This is a game changer of a human sexuality book – not just for women, who have always been told that men’s sexuality is the default (HINT: it’s not) – but for men who love women and don’t understand why the things that work for them, don’t work for women. Just….just go buy this. Buy this and read it and try not to be that weird person pushing a sex book on every single lady person you know. Because these are all lessons we need to learn. Better for us, better for everyone. — Rachel Manwillfrom The Best Books We Read in April: http://bookriot.com/2015/05/01/riot-r..."

Just ok.I love the concept behind this book and it started off very interesting and introduced several facts of which I was not previously aware. Unfortunately, it then became a long repetitive read with the bulk majority of the information being mostly common sense, and started to feel like a self-help book vs a nonfiction book on a fascinating topic. I found myself doing a lot of skimming on the back half wondering if there would be another interesting chapter coming up (like the start of the book), but the back 75% was rather dull for me. Worth a read if you feel clueless in this area. -------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: Women have cultural permission to criticize ourselves, but we are punished if we praise ourselves, if we dare to say that we like ourselves the way we are.First Sentence: To be a sex educator is to be asked questions."
6,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Come As You Are is absolutely the best book I've ever read, not just on sex, but on life and well being in general. Why read another book on sex? Because Emily describes how your brain and your life work together to create desire, and how to experience more pleasure, more joy, and more confidence with your relationships AND with sex. But this isn't the usual sex book with lavish promises of ecstasy by learning detailed techniques of where to put this and how to put it there. Emily gives you science that feels like a warm, soothing hug for all of the insecurities you've ever felt about your body, your sex, and your relationships, and then she describes how to apply science to your life so that you end up with the pleasure, joy and confidence. To be honest, after finishing a draft of this book, I felt more peace and well being than I'd felt in about ten years, which is about when I started worrying about my body and sex. And it's because Emily is describing how your brain interprets stress and how your body responds because of that, how to actually manage stress without just trying to relax, and how you can create a life that your body will respond all kinds of YES to. Then add in science about how your brain works with goals, and what kind of goal you have around your sex life, and then you can appreciate how to work with the reality of your life and not just the fantasy of what you want your love life to be. I've read Emily's blog for a couple years now, but the way she puts everything together and elaborates on all the science makes everything click in a way that feels reassuring and full of potential. I'm now reading parts of the draft again, and understanding even better how all of the elements work together to build joy and confidence and pleasure. It's truly beautiful.Come As You Are is the most practical book I've ever read about sex, and with this book and Sheri Winston's Anatomy of Arousal, I would never have needed any other book on sex. And I bought hundreds. I'm also not the most sciencey person, and luckily, Emily explains really complicated concepts in an easy to apply way. I really think this book could change our culture's whole idea of sexuality in a way that creates more pleasure for everyone. "
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,Rating 2 out of 5,"I kept searching for the ""SCIENCE"" that was promised in the title. There was some there, but the book is a soft self affirmation. There were some interesting bits, but not enough to warrant a full reading."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly,Rating 5 out of 5,"Books like this are why I LOVE non-fiction.This should be required reading on female sexuality, both for those with vaginas and those who are interested in or love someone with a vagina. I mention the parts here because they ARE a big component of the book. This is a guide to how everyone has the same parts, rearranged differently, and it's our perception of that and relationship with that mentality that changes our feelings, perceptions, and experiences of sex itself. Nagoski writes in an empowering, encouraging, fun, and yes, FUNNY, manner. I would hand this to every single woman I know. For me, the biggest take away, the moment which took this from really good to outstanding, was her discussion on body image, on body weight, and how it is our culture plus some that screws us up so bad. In short, it's the patriarchy that smashes female desire, love, and interest in sex and in their own sexual beings and experiences. We accept male-as-default forgetting that also means women lose out over and over and over again. Buy this one. Read it. Then pass it along. Seriously. It's THAT good. "
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10463035-caseythecanadianlesbrarian,Rating 3 out of 5,"For some women I have no doubt this would be a life-changing book. I definitely learned some cool stuff, things I am pissed that I did not know (because, patriarchy). But I guess I'm lucky enough that I don't really need the 'self-help' of this book to help with my sex life, and this aspect is really the meat of the book. Also, Nagoski acknowledges that the book is for and about cisgender women, so that omission didn't bother me (there isn't enough science about trans women or enby people), but I did still feel like it was suited for straight women in long term monogamous relationships, which Nagoski doesn't give a disclaimer for like she does the focus on cis women. The examples of lesbians didn't really feel like they were specific to those experiences and bi women don't come up at all. Single and poly women wouldn't get a lot out of this that would speak specifically to those experiences either, I don't think. Plus, the metaphors used to explain absolutely everything got to me after a while."
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer,Rating 3 out of 5,"Come as You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life is a nonfiction, self-help book written by sex educator, researcher, and author Emily Nagoski. It educates about a variety of issues that impact women's sexuality, and while some of it got quite repetitive in my opinion and I didn't quite take away as much new information as I expected to, I'm glad I read it. My favorite part discussed how the model of sexual response is based entirely on how men work, and if women fail to be like men, they are often not considered sexually normal. Any woman can tell you this isn't breaking news but I thought having a whole section themed with ""you are normal, it's the world around you that's broken"" was incredibly validating. I will forever and a day support women who choose the science field, and I have a high appreciation for Ms. Nagoski's reasons for writing this book in the first place. Check it out! My favorite quote:""When people ask me, ""Am I normal?"" They're asking, ""Do I belong?"" The answer is yes. You belong in your body. You belong in the world. You've belonged since the day you were born, this is your home. You don't have to earn it by conforming to some externally imposed sexual standard.""7/6/16: I'm actually super excited about this book. No shame ladies - learning is good!"
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42191546-kalyn-nicholson,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book not only unpacks all of the damage and misleading imbedded ideas our culture passes down each generation to both women AND men about female sexuality, but it also dives into all the practices and ways one can untangle such a mess and reclaim ones unique sexual identity. From understanding that everyone (all sexes) are made of the exact same parts, just organized differently, to grasping the idea that if your 'map' doesn't match your 'forest/garden/land', the map is wrong - not you; this book brings what is considered to be so many taboo topics into focus with easily understood metaphors, interesting studies and personal stories from all kinds of women that one can relate to in one way or another. This book is a beautiful invitation to get to know oneself (and potential partners) more intimately, embody oneself more confidently (without any needed changes) and embrace one's ""on's"" and ""off's"" in a way that empowers the individual to take their sexuality by the reigns and steer it in whatever direction they see fit - from frequency to interests and exploration. What an empowering read and one that I wish I had found many years ago to save myself from a long stretch of unnecessary insecurities about my body, internalized inadequacy from partners who just weren't the right intimate fit and mood-killing shame from nonconsensual experiences that left some previously unhealed damage.Hats off to Nagoski, now I only wish I had her as a friend to call up and discuss these ideas with in person. Passing the book off to all of my friends instead! "

13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1991298-anna,Rating 2 out of 5,"When the title of a book claims to tackle “The Surprising New Science,” I would expect to actually have new research references and more sciencey information about “responsive desire” vs “spontaneous desire,” arousal disorders, and women sexuality. But then again, it is followed by the highly self-help-ish “Will Transform Your Sex Life,” so I should have known better. The author does throw in some studies and articles - plus some Plato, for good measure -, but the chatty tone of the book is rather that of a therapy session, if not downright colloquial. I felt like overhearing a very long conversation between girlfriends. The reassurance that “we are all normal” and that our differences are “all normal, all beautiful” soon became an irritating catchphrase and an insufficient explanation. I also found the two teensy-tiny sections addressing traumatic experiences, by emphasizing that “you can simply begin practicing mindfulness, and gradually the trauma will work its way out, like shrapnel from an old wound,” almost laughable!When you’re using phrases like “for realsie real” and “have all the feels” (with tons of ‘feels” variations) it is very hard for me to take you seriously. Few of the things discussed here were fundamentally new to me, others simply commonsensical, so clearly I may not be the target audience."

Rating: 4 stars 
  
Cover: 🌟🌟🌟
 With the bright pink background and pseudo-vagina, I would have found this book cover more striking if the features had been arranged and formatted slightly differently. As it is, the design looks nice enough and is fitting for the genre. ""The Clit, the Whole Clit, and Nothing but the Clit"" 
Writing: 🌟🌟🌟🌟
 From the start, Emily Nagoski's writing style is clear and easy to follow. The casual, conversational tone may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I enjoyed it. This style seemed perfectly suited for communicating science to a general audience in an engaging manner. The stories and recurring metaphors also kept me interested through the information-packed chapters. The only thing that annoyed me was the constant repetition of key concepts, but I understand that this was simply to emphasise these points. 
Content: 🌟🌟 🌟🌟
 Emily Nagoski does a great job of merging science with her experience as a sex educator. The concepts she presents for improving sexual well-being are strongly infused with body positivity and normalcy messages. This created a warm, comfortable atmosphere that is perfect for what can be a complex and sensitive topic. There is so much information to take in, and I love the recap points at the end of each chapter. “It turns out what matters most is not the parts you are made of or how they are organised, but how you feel about those parts.” Everything considered, 'Come as You Are' is a great read that empowers women with tools and knowledge for improving their sexual well-being. The casual writing style made it easy to take in the contents, and these are backed by science and experience. I will certainly be returning to this book from time to time to glean as much as I can from it."

Pretty much every page contains some new and surprising concept on sexuality, body image and self-esteem. Written in clear, simple, sympathetic prose, every woman - and arguably, every man who has ever been baffled by a woman's sexuality - should read this. "
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5995202-isil-arican,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book reminds me why I hate reading self help books. I listened an interview with the writer in a podcast and read couple of chapters and enjoyed it. However the remaining of the book is pretty disappointing. Writer thinks she is funny and she is not. And the style is mostly for teenagers. There are some useful information but it feels too redundant since she keeps repeating the same things over and over again. Some arguments are pretty fallacious. I laughed out loud when she made an analogy on losing weight - removing your brain makes you lose 4 pounds of fat, or amputation would make your BMI go down. My laugh was not because she is funny but because of the ridiculous analogies she made. And ""Don't yuck others yum""?! Seriously sounds like a book for kindergarten kids."
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13615165-marta-the-book-slayer,Rating 5 out of 5,"If there's anything that has been stopping you from reading about women's health and sexual wellbeing (first of all ask yourself why - if you are judgmental of it, let's address that first and kindly come back to this with an open mind), it doesn't get easier than picking this baby up! I don't know by what circumstances I have come across this book, maybe this title came to me in a dream, maybe the forces that control this universe delivered it through necessary intervention (and with the use of my credit card) or perhaps deep down I knew that this was a book I particularly needed to read. The first thing that is stated in this book and reiterated throughout is that you are normal. Our world, including the media and those around us personally, have constantly spoken their opinion on what is the ""normal"" way of being, acting, looking, feeling, sexual performing etc when in reality the way you are, the feelings that you have, the body that you have and the sexual experiences you have had are all normal. That was such a simple but profound message in this book that I needed to hear and really set up the foundation for a satisfactory reading experience. Maybe you are still unconvinced thinking to yourself this sounds like a whole bunch of fluff, why would marta recommend me a book that just seems to tell me something I know, well first of all I'm glad you know it and second of all that was just the first chapter hunny, we got loads to unload.The second chapter focuses on the dual control model: everyone (YES EVERYONE) is equipped with accelerators and inhibitors. For some their accelerator (the turn-ons) are very sensitive and they can rush off and have sex at any convenience. For others, their inhibitor (the turn-offs) are very sensitive and they hit the breaks. The inhibitors are influenced by multitude of things such as personal body image, stresses in every day life, the simple fact that their feet our cold, etc - it varies so much that you can quickly see how these external influences come into play when you want to get into play ;) and make it very hard to be present and get full pleasure during sex. WOW!!! Can we just take a deep breath here because two things:1. EVERYONE - that means men included have these accelerators and inhibitors and this is HUGE especially given the common perception that men are always ready to go and bone while it takes a little longer for a women to be in the mood. 2. There are various combinations of what people can have. Maybe they have very sensitive accelerators and laid-back brakes or the opposite or maybe they fall right in the middle of both. The important thing to note here is that everyone has these inhibitors that make it harder to enjoy sex and ITS COMPLETELY NORMALPhew. I don't know about you but I felt absolutely validated after learning this which I feel is never taught in sex ed (at least we know how to put a condom on a banana). We've got a pretty solid foundation set up for us and what unfolds is ways to how to address the inhibitors, create the right context for sex, the difference between learning/liking/wanting, why you should be non-judgmental, non-concordance, desire vs pleasure, ways to orgasm (and why it's okay if you don't) and many more all within 300+ pages of this book. Can you believe it? Because I am still in disbelief by how much I have learned. I hope I have done some decent job of convincing you to give this book a try and if I didn't then hopefully you at least learned something from my review. I genuinely love the topic of women's health and learning as much as I can about my body. I'm so excited to continue on this journey, so much so that I have started a dedicated shelf to women's health (that is also featured on my page) where I will be adding the books that I read and learn from. If you have any recommendations (books or podcasts), I would highly appreciate those in the comments. I started this book with a scientific mindset and ended up learning so much more about myself instead. As soon as this review is published, this book will be nicely gift wrapped and passed along to my close friend who I think will benefit from this as much as I did.Here's to reading more about sex (and women's health) and having more pleasurable sex in 2022!!"
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/857820-diana,Rating 5 out of 5,"Updating review: I wrote this review almost five years ago. I'm cringing at using ""lady parts"". I still stick to my five star review, it helped me open up a lot sexually. I still recommend it to everyone, whether you identify as man or woman. Original review:I picked up this book because I was interested in the science and emotion connecting woman’s sexuality without sounding like a text-book or a Cosmo article. This book doesn’t just talk about your lady parts, it celebrates them, a notion I’m not familiar with. I felt for the first time I got a glimpse of how I am as a woman and how my sexuality is connected to every part of life. I think every woman should read this book- if it will help a fellow reader understand their body better, it’s worth reading. Even if you don’t have sex, are a virgin, hate sex or have an amazing sex life, don’t let the title throw you off. It’s a book to celebrate the female body, and the emotions and sexuality involved. I’ll admit I didn’t even want to add this book to “currently reading” list on Goodreads because I was embarrassed. There’s nothing embarrassing about being a 30-something year old healthy woman who enjoys sex but I just thought talking about sex was something shameful. If I had this book years ago, I can’t imagine the stress it would have saved me. Regardless if the topic of sex makes you blush or not, please read this book."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35995783-rae,Rating 3 out of 5,"Come as you are is, at its core, a sexual self help book. It's raison d'être is to reassure women that their bodies and sexualities are normal and wonderful and to accept themselves the way that they are, and in doing so pave the way to pleasure! I'm convinced that most people who read this book will come away with more kindness toward their sexual selves and more understanding of both their and their partner's inner workings.It's a book whose heart is firmly in the right place. There is a wholesome and joyful message at its centre. If you've been feeling dissonance and feel like you've been trying to squish your sexuality to fit society's expectations rather than listening to your own body, with all its wants and needs, I highly recommend you give this book a read.Outside of sexuality, the sections on dealing with physiological stress are helpful and practical in and of themselves.Having said that, I really hate being patronised. Nagoski has this annoying habit of warning the reader when the sciency bits are coming up and using phrases like: ""for realsie reals"" and ""dig this"". I understand that most people don't want to read a boring text book, but I'm a grown-up and it winds me up. My other major issue is that although lots of attention is given to spontaneous vs reactive desire, non-concordance, variation in orgasm methods... these points are driven home repetitively, whereas many other aspects of sexuality that may be causing worry are mostly ignored. For example, Nagoski is clear that YOU'RE ALL NORMAL... all of you... you, you and you... isn't it great? Unless you experience any pain with intercourse. That's not normal. See a doctor. But as a doctor I have seen young women who are absolutely terrified that their vaginismus means they are broken. Pain doesn't necessarily mean you aren't normal. Sex can be painful or uncomfortable if someone is tense or not aroused enough. It doesn't mean it will always be painful and it doesn't mean you are broken. It IS worth seeing a doctor if you're worried and to listen to your body's cues, but higher anxiety can beget even more pain in these circumstances. Also, I felt that the area of WHAT turns people on was very poorly covered. What about people worrying about their harmless but unusual fetishes? The Cosmo quiz, meant to determine how sensitive your accelerator and brakes are made me very angry. You simply can't make any judgement on someone's sexuality based on such narrow criteria! People are turned on by a whole range of things and sometimes it takes many years of exploration to discover what they are. I can just imagine a young girl reading this and thinking ""oh, I must not be a very sexual person because I don't get turned on by smells or by seeing my partner doing well at stuff"". Nagoski acknowledges that her quiz is not scientific but then proceeds to talk about the results like they mean something. They don't. So although I endorse the book's core message and would encourage wide readership (it is a book that will do more good than harm), there were for me, some glaring omissions. That doesn't mean it isn't a very worthwhile read.In Nagoski's own words: ""I wrote it because I am done living in a world where women are lied to about their bodies; where women are objects of sexual desire rather than subjects of sexual pleasure; where sex is used as a weapon against women; and where women believe their bodies are broken, simply because those bodies are not male. And I am done living in a world where women are trained from birth to treat their bodies as the enemy."" Absolutely.This book is, on the whole, a sex positive celebration of female sexuality - and that can only be a good thing."

I want to buy a copy for every bridal shower I ever go to (for the bride AND groom). I want to buy two copies to save and give to my daughters one day. It's just great. Emily Nagoski. Can we be friends please? She's such a wise, understanding, encouraging, inspiring scientist! Her main ideas are that women's sexuality is not men's-sexuality-lite, that women approach sex (attraction, desire, arousal) differently and that's normal, and also that women often approach things differently from other women - and that's normal! It's all about accepting yourself where you are and recognizing the ways that culture & media have told us lies about our bodies and sexuality. It's about being a whole person who is forgiving and patient and kind to herself in all areas of life - including sexuality. I keep writing and then deleting this review so I'm just going to end it here w a quote. ""When people ask me ""Am I normal?"" They're asking, ""Do I belong?"" The answer is yes. You belong in your body. You belong in the world. You've belonged since the day you were born, this is your home. You don't have to earn by conforming to some externally imposed standard. ...You are normal. Beautiful. And as long as you're not experiencing pain, you're healthy. So when you notice yourself feeling dissatisfied with your sexuality, when you notice shame or frustration or grief, allow yourself to direct those feelings away from yourself and instead focus those emotions toward the culture that told you the wrong story."""
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145190452-mel-thomas,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow, uh, so, this book made me cry a lot! The thing that I didn’t totally understand going in (or perhaps understood intellectually but not emotionally) is that in order to improve both the quality of the sex you’re having (either with yourself or with others) and your relationship with your own sexuality, you’re gonna have to both have a comprehensive remedial sex ed class AND the most intense therapy session of your life, combined, and that’s what this book is. But Nagoski approaches that challenge with remarkable tenderness, compassion, and candor. I’ll point out that the book is, by its own admission, based on research about and primarily targeted at cis women—a fact that Nagoski is transparent about. This is a research-based book, and there just isn’t a lot of research on the sex lives of trans people (yet). But the message undergirding the entire book—that we’re ALL (literally ALL of us, of ALL genders) made of the same parts, organized in different ways—is so thoughtfully and comprehensively made that I was able to see myself in here anyway."

23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112990141-sabina-x1f406,Rating 5 out of 5,"What an incredible, incredible book. Everyone should have this book to be honest. First of all, what I love about this book is that it doesn’t discriminate against anyone. Emily makes sure that no woman feels “weird”, or “too much”. We are all “normal” in our desires and feelings about sex. She explains the reasoning behind how some women may have little interest in sex, while others may want it more. She also tells us how to explain to men about our anatomy, and how we are different in our hardwiring towards sex. I learned SO much from this book. I’m only sad I didn’t know this information sooner. Sadly, we learn too much from the media, and sometimes from what men tell us, which is 99% inaccurate. It’s ironic how they think they can sometimes tell us what our bodies should do.. anyways..Ladies, read this damn book."
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26091478-cassandra,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book was awesome for some reasons and a bit cringe-worthy for others. I'll start out with the good: This book is full of things that any person even remotely interested in sex should know. The author references specific studies, which lend credibility to her concepts. The book is empowering to women, assuring them that it is the sex culture that is the problem, not the way that women experience pleasure and desire - the map is wrong, not the terrain. This is a valuable message for people on the entire sexual spectrum. Unfortunately, while the tone of the writing was meant to be friendly and casual (and sometimes it is), other times it comes off as too cheeky for my taste. The book was also repetitive. I think that was on purpose, so that someone could read any given chapter and understand what came before it and what will come next, which is great if you want to share a specific concept with someone else. If you're going to read the book straight through, though, it gets a little irritating. Then, the book was written exclusively for women, despite the fact that men need to hear this too. I think some small tweaks would have made this empowering for women (and it's important that the focus is on women) but accessible to men as well."
25,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I found her tone patronising + her research highly selective. Also for all the claims of inclusivity, 90% of the book was aimed at/featured hetero couples with only one lesbian couple who were also living as a traditional-style nuclear family. Asexuals + aromantics are never discussed or featured as case studies. Neither are bisexuals or those in poly relationships. Most of the advice assumes the reader is half of a couple.Speaking personally as an asexual, I would never normally read a book that's purely about sex, but I'd heard good things about how positive the authoress was about those with a sexuality considered 'broken'. I was hoping for answers why I, + other folks like me don't function the way society tell us we should. I was disappointed.**Addendum**I would just like to forewarn Vegan/Animal Welfare centred potential readers of the book of graphic decriptions of animal experimentation which they may find upsetting. Also authoress is a zelous believer in the blank slate theory, in this case that our sexuality is entirely created by social enviroment. So if you believe you were 'born this way' with your particular sexual orientation it may grind your gears a bit."

Someone with strong brakes may need more work to turn them off and feel ready for sexy times than someone with weaker brakes.Sex is not a drive!"

Nagoski gives the explanation of female sexuality that I think most of us didn't get in health class or anywhere else really. The subtitle is click-bait-y. I do think this book has the power to improve the sex lives of those who read it, but not because it's some kind of kinky how-to book. It can do this because it's a great explanation of how women's bodies work and how history and culture have done us a great disservice through the myths they disseminate. Important for women and the people who love them.Read it. Do it. You won't be sorry."

29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5099486-lynndee-lynndee-s-library,Rating 5 out of 5,"This did more for my mental health than my sexual health, tbh. But then again a big narrative of this book is that where you are mentally affects where you are sexually, which makes sense. The book has 9 chapters and at the end of each chapter it has a TL;DR section, so I'm going to do that for this review. Here are MY main takeaways:1. Everyone is born with a garden to tend (that's our sexuality). What's planted in that garden isn't up to us, it's up to our parents and other outside influences. How we tend that garden is influenced by social construct. Some of us were planted with flowers and taught to love and care for our garden (positive outlook on sexuality) while other gardens were planted with weeds and left to rot (negative outlook). It is never too late though to change how you tend your garden (your outlook on sexuality)2. While we can be really good at dealing with stressors, we're actually not that good at dealing with the actual stress. ""Keeping calm"" is all well and good but our bodies were built to process stress fully and so we need to do that, either with physical activity, screaming, or some other sort of release. 3. Speaking of gardens, just because I have an aloe garden that only needs a little bit of sunlight, that doesn't make it any better or worse than your tomato garden that needs lots of sunlight. It just makes it different. It also doesn't mean that you should also have an aloe garden instead of a tomato garden, or that I should also have a tomato garden instead of my aloe garden. 4. Women have been taught that we are ""broken"" because our libidos and our arousal differs than men, because men are the default preferred sexual functioning, when really we're just women. 5. It's not how you feel, it's how you feel ABOUT how you feel. We've been taught that negative emotions are not ok and so we feel bad when we DO have them. Which then just makes us feel worse. It's a dangerous cycle. So just recognize that you're having a negative emotion, process it completely, and then move on. 6. Our Western Puritan views on sex and sexuality have really fucked women over, but it's not too late to change. I think this is one of those where, even if you have a great sex life, you could still gain something from this book. "

Come As You Are is a science-based book about female sexuality, written by a sex educator with a PhD in human sexuality. I recommend this for anyone who is a woman, has sex with women, or cares about the Me Too movement and how we frame rape culture. Some of this was information I've figured out over the years but wish I had been given as a teenager. Some of it was new and useful today. It is a book for single women and for women in long-term committed relationships (like myself). The author covers a lot of ground and shows sensitivity to survivors of sexual violence. Whether you have questions about what is normal in terms of anatomy or sexual response (answer: pretty much everything!), are struggling with sexuality in a long term relationship, or have a great sex life but want to learn more and make it even better, this book is for you! If you care about how we frame rape and the importance of understanding that genital response is NOT necessarily equivalent to desire (i.e. the ""your words say no, but your body says yes"" problem) then this book is for you. It's also really useful for understanding the Dual Control Model of sexual arousal: we have neural ""brakes"" AND a neural ""accelerator"" and everyone has different levels of sensitivity to their dual controls. This is really helpful in terms of practical application and understanding why most women have sexual desire that responsive rather than spontaneous. She also discusses the role of chronic stress and how to more effectively manage it. If this sounds confusing, don't worry, she does a fantastic job of explaining everything and I promise it's worth figuring out! "

Honestly, I started off a bit skeptical since I really didn’t expect to learn much. I’ve been with the same man for almost 5 years and I thought I was pretty sex-educated. Not that I claim to be an expert or anything, but I simply thought there wouldn’t be much I hadn’t heard of in this book. Boy, was I wrong. There were terms for things I didn’t even realize had terms. She put into words things I’ve personally experienced, things other women have told me they’ve experienced, and things I’ve seen in media/books as well. The author is a sex educator who holds a PhD and this book was a mix of science, anecdotes, and theories. The only reason I took off a star was because this woman goes pretty heavy with the metaphors 😂 Overall, I would recommend this to women of all ages. I would even recommend reading it with your partner if you have one. I didn’t read it with mine but I plan on showing him some of my highlights. This covers a wide array of topics such as in-depth anatomy, sexual response cycles, sexual breaks/accelerators, navigating context, and much more. I found the sections on stress management especially helpful for me. I loved the sex and body positivity throughout. It doesn’t matter if you’re single, having casual hookups, or with a long-term partner — this book helps provide you the tools to be confident in your own skin and sexuality. This is the type of education about our bodies and sexuality every woman should receive. "

Clumsy metaphors about how your sexuality is a garden, your sexuality is an apple tree, and trite, repetitive encouragements about how you're so normal and so unique. It’s made worse by the over the top narration in the audiobook, where every other word has an exclamation mark appended.Here are some highlights:""The goal of understanding your brake and accelerator is not to understand what men are like, versus what women are like, but to understand what you are like: unique, with great potential for awesomeness.""""First, because it means your genitals are normal—and not just normal, but amazing and beautiful and captivating and delicious and enticing, on down the alphabet, all the way to zesty—regardless of what they look like. They are unique to you. The entire range is normal. Beautiful. Perfect.""""...she worried about sex while she was having it. She called it noisy brain—yup, totally high SIS.

[...] This time, imagine your brother is raised in the normal rat way but without the lemon thing, but during his first opportunity to copulate with a receptive female, the researchers put him into a rodent harness, a comfortable little jacket. If your brother is wearing his little rat jacket the first time he copulates with a receptive female...""Wanting to make a book accessible to a wide audience is commendable, but you can't tell me that there aren't better ways than asking the reader to imagine themselves as a horny-for-lemons lab rat with a rat brother who likes wearing a rat harness during sex.Writing aside, the science in the quarter of the book I managed to finish wasn't convincing or well-presented. For example, she states that Viagra doesn't work on women because of psychological ""brakes,"" then moves on without a shred of explanation to back this claim. With the rat experiment quoted above, she uses it as evidence to argue that responses to sexual stimuli are learned and very little is innate, like ""learning the language you're surrounded by."" I have a serious problem with this blanket statement and the implications this view has on queer folk. Perhaps she was intentionally simplifying it to make her point, but what you choose to omit is as crucial as what you choose to include."

This text seemed like a beginners guide to loving oneself. Ugh. No. There was nothing truly sexy or erotic even in the stories that she shared, which made me, a long-time Savage Love Podcast listener, feel like I was reading a G-rated article from Self. I blame myself for reading up to the last few pages when she reminded readers that we are all responsible for “cultivating our [sexual] gardens—digging out the weeds and nurturing the plants.” I just get kept wondering exactly who are these women who found her advice helpful? And the men in these anecdotes who have to put up an elaborate show for their sex “braked” partners must be just as exhausted as their (as she depicts them) haggard mommy-wives.

38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,Rating 4 out of 5,"I actually first heard about this book from Alyssa Cole. When she visited the Tucson Festival of Books last year, I went to a panel she was on about consent being sexy, and she mentioned that she was reading it, and had learned a lot of things people assume about women’s sexuality was wrong. I put it on my TBR but just never got around to it, despite sexuality being one of my favorite things to read about. Luckily one of my IRL book club members picked this for our next read, and I was immediately excited (one of the other members, my longtime friend, wasn’t paying attention because she was chasing after her toddler, so when the book arrived in the mail from Amazon with its suggestive pseudo-vagina cover, she got quite the shock; this story has no point, I just like it, and the text exchanges were very amusing to me).The book wasn’t quite what I was expecting, though. I was expecting an informative, science-based book, aimed at educating the public about how sex really works, with a feminist focus. And it was that! But, it is also a self-help book. This makes sense, because Nagoski is a sex therapist, and she wrote the book not only to educate in a general sense, but to literally help anyone who reads the book to have a better, more satisfying sex life through understanding how their sexual responses actually work.Will note here, as the book does up front: there just hasn’t been enough research on trans women’s bodies, or those people who identify as non-binary, for Nagoski to have drawn conclusions about how their bodies work, if there are differences. So this is a book focused on sex responses in cis women (and to a much, much smaller extent, cis men).The main premise of the book is that most of our cultural understandings about sex treat women’s bodies and sexualities the same as men’s, and that if women’s bodies are seen to work in ways that are different, they are considered broken. Nagoski’s main thing is to prove that for various social, genetic, and other environmental factors, women’s bodies work different than men’s when it comes to sex. Her other main thing is stressing that unless you are in pain, your body and your reactions are entirely normal. There is a huge range of diversity built into human sexuality, and no matter where you are on the spectrum, you do not need to be “fixed”. Instead, through evidence based techniques, she shows you how to adjust your thinking and your environment (your “context”) instead of thinking you are broken and trying to fix yourself. The main focus is definitely on the individual (and the individual’s partner), but she does stress that cultural change would make a lot of this easier for everyone.I thought the two strongest chapters were when she talked about nonconcordance (the idea that bodily reactions do not always correspond to actual arousal; in men concordance only happens 50% of the time, in women 10%), and the chapter where she talked about stress. I’m not even going to try and go into the details, because her arguments live in those details that she provides, and I will bungle it. I will just say that she provides some really neat shifts in perspective that seem like they would be incredibly helpful. And all of it is backed by actual science, and explanations for how and why the body does what it does.Highly recommend this one!"
39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a really useful book in terms of myth-busting about women and sex, and giving advice for people who may be struggling in their sex lives in various ways. Sure, at times it can go on long with the metaphors or be a little cutesy, but there aren’t tons of books that cover the same ground and overall I think this one is pretty insightful and affirming.Some interesting things I took away from it:-	Only about a quarter of women regularly orgasm from intercourse (i.e. PIV sex). This makes perfect sense because the same tissue that in male infants develops into the head of the penis, in female infants develops into the clitoris (not the vagina). It is the most sensitive part for a reason!-	About a third of women have primarily or exclusively responsive desire, meaning you have to already be having fun before you start experiencing a physical urge toward sex, as opposed to just spontaneously wanting it.-	And this shouldn’t be considered a problem, because plenty of people who have fabulous sex have responsive desire. Overall the book tries to refocus the goal of sex toward pleasure rather than desire, with the latter not really being that important as long as everyone is consenting and having fun.-	For men, there’s about a 50% overlap between genital response and subjectively feeling turned on. For women? Only 10%. Women often get wet just in response to “this is sex-related” (which is why some women have genital response from rape—from an evolutionary perspective this makes sense, as it helps prevent injury!), but you can also be having a good time without being wet. Just use the damn lube.-	The accelerator vs. brakes model for being sexually turned on is apparently based in brain science, and can be helpful for people who are struggling to get into sex. You might have an insensitive accelerator, in which case increasing the sexiness of the situation, or training your brain to see more things as sex-related, can be helpful. On the other hand, you might have sensitive brakes—or life events might just be hitting the brakes hard—in which case removing the barriers should be the focus, rather than increasing sexiness. Brakes can include anything from distractions to body insecurities to life stress to a trauma history to negative views about sex.-	On body issues: a lot of this is really just cultural, as from a medical standpoint, it’s better to be 50 pounds overweight than 10 pounds underweight. There’s also a section on how genitals come in a variety of different configurations, what’s popular in porn is not actually the default, and as long as they’re not causing you pain or infection you shouldn’t worry about it.-	Nagoski also argues that we need to stop turning genitals into metaphors. Having larger external genitals as a woman doesn’t mean you are more “masculine” or sexually-motivated. And hymens apparently don’t really have anything to do with virginity (I knew you could lose them other than through having sex; I didn’t know that you could have sex and still have a hymen).A bunch of other useful stuff in here too—this one is definitely worth a look for both women and men. Solid advice if your sex life isn’t all you want it to be, but intriguing and possibly sex-life-improving information either way."

The author included some science - studies, explanation of the biological/neurological aspects involved in various sexual processes-- but felt a little too Deepak Chopra for me. The metaphors were not great- sexual self as garden, orgasm as birds or flock of birds. She should have either gone with the science *or* gone with the inspirational, feel good, nonscientific approach. Trying to use pretend science to promote Chopra-like inspirations just didn't work. At first, I thought, even if the reader doesn't need the self help, it's still a great subject to learn more about. I am a strong believer in talking openly about sex. I saw this book on the nominee list for best nonfiction and I wanted to like it. The first half of the book was much better than the second half. I should have just stopped reading, but I thought the good would peak through again. It didn't. The author made sweeping unsupported statements and promoted generalized ""cures"" for sexual disfunction that seemed like maybe they might or might not work, but where is the evidence? I realize this was supposed to be a master's class but it was not a class I feel I would learn a lot from. Sadly, March Roach's sarcastic look at sex, Bonk, taught me far more actual facts about sex. I enjoyed it much more than this. "

52,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2360394-stacy,Rating 5 out of 5,"My summary of this book, written by a sex therapist and geared mostly towards a female audience, would be: Your sexuality and body, almost without exception, are normal and beautiful. Can you accept that truth? I would recommend this book to every sexually active woman I know. The research and information found here is helpful, debunking many, many culturally held misconceptions about female sexuality in particular. Ok, now for my copious notes, for my future forgetful self and for those who want the brief version. (But read the full version, in case I don't do it justice.)Male and female bodies start the same in the womb, but eventually turn into either male or female sex organs. The penis is the equivalent of the clitoris, and that's why women can orgasm despite this function serving no evolutionary purpose. (That doesn't mean it isn't important.) We all have the same parts, just organized differently.Sexual desire is controlled by SES and SIS systems. SES is like the accelerator, picking up on environmental clues relating to sex (naked man/woman, smells, flirting), and SIS is like the breaks, picking up on information that would prevent you from having sex (fear of pregnancy, STI, kids in the hallway). Everyone has different levels of sensitivity. Men in general tend to have stronger SES (accelerators) and women (esp moms!) tend to have stronger SIS (brakes), but there are many exceptions, of course. She has an excellent quiz that will tell you and/or your partner how you rank on both systems, which was FASCINATING. If you're having trouble with sexual desire, the easiest solution is the remove or minimize the ""breaks"" (get a babysitter so the kids don't interrupt you, lower your stress level any way you can, stop making orgasm the ""goal"" and just enjoy the sensations and pleasure instead). There are 2 types of desire: spontaneous (I feel like I want to have sex!) and responsive (you may not initially feel horny, but once your partner stimulates you sexually, it feels good and NOW you're into it). Again, in general, men tend to be more spontaneous and women more responsive IN GENERAL. That doesn't mean either one is better, they're just different.One reason many women feel inadequate about their sexuality is patriarchy - the idea that if your desire doesn't match with the traditional male sexual drive (spontaneous desire, followed by organism during vaginal penetration), then there is something wrong with you. The author asserts that unless you're experiencing pain, there is probably NOT anything wrong with you, except the damaging cultural messages you've been receiving. (Note: Only 25% of women reliably orgasm during vaginal penetration, so really. Totally a patriarchal misconception.)Sex is NOT A DRIVE - it is a desire or an interest. This matters because if it is considered a physical need, then sexual exploitation of girls in India, for example, is justifiable because it fills a male ""need"". If it is an interest or a drive, on the other hand, it can be viewed as the unacceptable exploitation is truly is.There is NO CONNECTION between size of penis/clitoris and sexual desire.There is NO CONNECTION between having a hymen intact and virginity. For women, there is only a 10% association between vaginal wetness and arousal. This is called non concordance. I'll say it again for the people in the back- just because a women is wet does not mean she is aroused. For men, there is a 50% association between wetness and arousal - much higher, but it still does not follow that just because any human is wet that they are aroused and welcoming sexual advances. A woman's collection of sexual parts are NOT CALLED A VAGINA - it's a VULVA. The vagina is the hole itself.There is no erectile dysfunction medication that works for women because women are too complex and orgasm happens in the brain, not the body.Flatliners lose desire for sex when stressed or depressed, but 10-20% of people actually desire sex more in those situations. Meditation/mindfulness usually helps with this.Not all women want or experience orgasms. And that's ok.What matters isn't so much your sexuality or body- it's how YOU FEEL ABOUT your sexuality and body! Learning to allow yourself to experience pleasure is the greatest gift you can give yourself and your partner.Great read, great tips, and could possibly save you lots of money on therapy. :-D"

For the next year, I will be gifting this book to every single woman in my life, so if we’re irl friends, be prepared. This book is comprehensive, yet accessible. I learned SO MUCH (nonconcordance, stress cycles, and the way arousal & desire actually work!?) and it made me realize how little we teach folks about female sexual pleasure & functioning.Needless to say, I grew up to be pretty sex-negative (aside from the overall sex negative culture we live in, I was raised in a conservative catholic household). I’ve never felt comfortable talking to friends about sex or my anatomy and have always felt fear & shame in response to those two topics, but this book truly opened up my world. (I’m not kidding, it’s a huge deal that I even feel comfortable sharing with you all that I read a book about sex!!)Emily Nagoski did a great job in this book of breaking down complex biological/physiological/psychological concepts in a way that was easy to understand and fun to read. She also takes a relatively intersectional approach to the topic, not discounting the effects of race, class, and ability in regards to sex. It also isn’t heteronormative, but she does stick to the science about cisgender folks because there simply isn’t enough research about trans & non-binary folks (though Nagoski suspects their sexual functioning works much the same way).This book serves the purpose of helping you understand your likes & dislikes, open your world to maximize your sexual pleasure, and realize YOU ARE NORMAL!!!If you have a vagina, read this book! If you love someone with a vagina, read this book! Honestly, I wish everyone would just read this book!!!"

The rest is pure stupidity. It's another book on how obese women should be okay being obese (they shouldn't. It's not normal to be unhealthy and still expect your brain to be happy). She gave a stupid example about how if you cut your leg off, you may have lost weight, but your health didn't change. Really? Are your that oblivious? The problem isn't weight, it's the ""context"" of weight, I.e. Fat. Too much body fat is proven to put your body at risk.Also, I rolled my eyes all 3 times I saw she blamed women's issues on patriarchy. It's totally idiotic and a completely invalid point. Moron. "

60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,Rating 4 out of 5,"Come As You Are: The Surprising New Science that Will Transform Your Sex Life has been on my to-read list for a while (I blame Hannah Witton), but I finally bought it as a birthday present for a friend who shares my interest in these subjects. Emily Nagoski’s book is a comprehensive guide to how people with vulvas can become more comfortable and fulfilled in their sex lives. It’s a little bit science text, a little bit self-help, and a lot of interesting discussion of the ways in which our mental states affect our physical wellbeing.Much of the book builds on research done by Erick Janssen and John Bancroft into a framework for sexual response involving two systems: the Sexual Excitement System, SES, your accelerator; and the Sexual Inhibition System, SIS, or your brake. This alone, as well as Nagoski’s related explication of the homologous nature of male and female sex organs, would make the book worth reading. The accelerator/brake framework offers a useful way of describing how external stimuli can work to turn one on or turn one off—these are not always direct inverses. Nagoski uses her experience as an academic and a sex therapist to translate the work of Janssen and Bancroft, as well as others, into understandable contexts for the rest of us. I really appreciate that, while the tone of this book is definitely one of therapy/self-help, it is relentlessly grounded in a scientific mindset and draws on the latest available information at the time. Nagoski refuses to fall back on reductive, binary stereotypes about how “men are like this” and “women are like that” when it comes to sex. She makes generalizations, of course—one must—while pointing out that the variation within a group is still greater than the variation between groups; i.e., we are all more the same than we are different.Along the same lines, Nagoski’s overall thesis—that whatever your experience, whatever your body’s responses, whatever you crave or desire to get yourself off, it’s normal—is also laudable. Come As You Are is prescriptive only in the sense that it wants you to find what works best for you. This is not a book full of “quick and easy tips” as promised on the cover of Cosmopolitan. Indeed, Nagoski regularly reminds the reader that gains in this area are almost always the result of dedicated effort and time. She doesn’t guarantee mind-blowing orgasms—but she does guarantee you’ll come away from this book with a better understanding of how our sexual response works.Now, this book doesn’t apply to me from a practical point of view for two reasons—I lack the right genitalia, and I’m asexual. But I don’t think that would disqualify someone as a potential reader. Really, people with vulvas should read this because it gives insight into their sex lives; people who might be into having sex with people with vulvas should read this to understand how to be more responsible, caring partners. Those of us who probably aren’t having sex with anyone can read this (if it’s not going to repulse you) to better understand this activity that everyone else seems fairly obsessed with.I don’t like how Nagoski frames asexuality. She defines it in a endnote, and through later implicit comparisons, as a lack of sexual desire. That’s not true—asexual people may or may not desire sex and might masturbate or even have sex with a partner if they so choose. Indeed, an asexual person with a vulva would probably find this book quite instructive even if all they’re interested in is self-pleasure. Asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction, an entire subject that Nagoski doesn’t really explore at all in this book. So, while the book overall tries to be agnostic about the partners of the subject, it doesn’t quite get the lived experience of asexuality right. Sigh.That gripe aside, it’s difficult to fault Come As You Are for its organization, depth of content, or goals. This is definitely more of a “sipping” book than it is something you swallow all at once—I pushed myself to read it all at once, because I needed to send it to my friend, and it still took me more than a week. The density of information here just makes it difficult (at least in my opinion) to fly through the book while still absorbing. If anything, you’d probably want to keep this book as reference material, returning to a chapter each time you need to refresh yourself about a particular point Nagoski makes.Overall, Come As You Are is a very thorough and compassionate look at a subject that is still not discussed seriously enough. (Even when we talk about female sexuality in most media, we often do it superficially or with an emphasis on pleasure rather than comfort and fulfillment. Female sexuality remains inextricably wrapped up in our patriarchal, heteronormative narratives about the roles different genders play in relationships and in sex.) This is the kind of book you want to grab to undo years of useless or non-existent sex education and to give you the permission to explore, if you want, what’s “normal” for you.

61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14036822-blair,Rating 5 out of 5,"If you read only one book on human sexuality, make it Come as You Are. This isn't your standard sex book. There are no promises here that learning one trick will drive you or your lover wild. But there is a lot of science, presented in an approachable manner, that provides great insight into how people work sexually (and, to be honest, in general as well). The book's stated audience is women, but I think anyone can benefit from the science that Nagoski covers in her book, regardless of sex. Sure, if you are a guy you'll read some things that don't directly apply to you, but I recommend you read this book anyway. It is that important.Why? Because what this book teaches you is immently important to your health, your sexual well being, and just general understanding of how you, and those you are intimate with, work. For instance, Nagoski's discussion of the dual control model, or the ""brakes"" and ""accelerator"" of arousal, provides an understanding of people can have a different level of arousal for similar events.Nagoski also talks about how stress impacts your arousability, and how stress can affect level of arousal differently for people (some people more aroused, others much less). She discusses how stress worked in the past for humans (when running from lions, for instance), and how we no longer allow stress ourselves to complete the full stress cycle. This discussion of how we, as a society, don't allow stress to complete the cycle is important, regardless of how it affects your sex life. I thought her point of how our method of dealing with stress is to avoid stressors, when it would be much healthier to learn to allow the stress cycle to complete, spot-on and more sensible than the common advice to avoid stress.One important item the book covers is genital nonconcordance, or how the brain and genitals can react two very different ways to the same stimulus at the same instant. I'd argue that it is important not only for couples to understand that, but individuals, both men and women, and for society at large. Why? Because we have this assumption that the genitals are the best, or the only way, to determine if someone is turned on, and it has dangerous repercussions in our society.I'd love to point to any particular section and say that it is the most important section. But I can't. Nagoski has provided a whole book full of facts, research, and understanding that makes it impossible to say any one part is more important. The whole book is important. I doubt you'll get through the book without wondering, ""why haven't I learned this before?""Why haven't I learned this before? Because no one told us. But Ms. Nagoski has, in an very approachable, and very readable book. Please, consider purchasing it, and highlighting it. Mark it up and dog-ear it. I honestly think that this book is that important to your, your health, and that of our society at large."
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12818720-kazen,Rating 3 out of 5,"In medicine there's a knowledge translation gap. Information about a new treatment or a better way of doing things takes, on average, fifteen years to become standard practice. Fifteen years! In the realm of human sexuality, though, the gap feels more like thirty years. Nagoski navigates that chasm by taking clinical research, wrapping it in a bit of self-help, and presenting it in an approachable way.And the information is so important. She busts sexual myths and beliefs that media, medicine, and moral authorities have perpetuated in our culture. Women rarely experience spontaneous desire, so they're broken (nope, it's probably responsive desire instead). If a woman is wet, she's aroused (nope, there's this thing called non-concordance - genitals don't always match mood). If a woman is too stressed to be into sex, she should just lighten up (nope, but completing the stress cycle may help). If you have or interact with a vulva there's lots of ideas and exercises that help, as the title states, to transform your sex life.Nagoski is a professor and the book feels a bit like a sexuality 101 lecture given to incoming freshmen. The tone is informal, she drops in references to Snapchat and Facebook, and the main ideas get repeated a ton. This probably works very well over the course of a semester-long class but squished into 400 pages it feels like a bit much.I didn't mind the informal tone, perhaps because I listened to the audiobook. The author reads it herself and her investment in and passion for the material come through loud and clear. While some things still irked me (""feels"" regularly substituted for ""feelings"", for example) sex can be an offputting subject and the tone will make it more accessible to more people, something I'm all for.I'm also all for the way she acknowledges and accepts people of all sexualities and orientations. One of the four couples followed through the book is lesbian. There are shoutouts when what she's talking about won't match the experience, say, of trans or polyamorous people. Sections dealing with violence against women are marked so you can skip them if you'd like.Reading this book has helped me reexamine my sex life and given me tools to go about fine tuning things I'm not happy with. Even if you're completely happy with what happens in the bedroom you'll still learn about how a woman's body works, which is valuable to pretty much everyone. Read and rock on, sister."
63,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117354218-kira,Rating 2 out of 5,"Ugh. I finally finished this book that took half a year to get through. It always takes me a while to read through non-fiction, but this has got to be a record. Every time I thought about reading this book, I thought of just about a hundred other things I'd rather do instead. I still managed to persevere rather than DNF it, but the experience was not fun.I'm not trying to discount the contents of this book. Lots of the information is reassuring and very positive for the average woman. We live in a society with high expectations for women and poor sex education. I'm sure that for lots of people, this is a fantastic cache of knowledge on the subject of female sexuality. A lot of the terminology was helpful for me, but I felt the content leaned too far toward the fluffy, accept yourself, love yourself bullshit. Nothing wrong with positivity, but I wanted something more scientific, considering that this book promotes science.That being said, hardly any of what Nagoski writes about was useful to me. I recognize that this is a very personal experience and that this book may actually do what it claims it will do on the cover and ""transform"" someone else's sex life. But this is my review and I thought that Nagoski's writing was infuriatingly annoying. She's so delicate with her delivery that every new bit of information comes with a, ""do you understand? you're completely normal, boo-boo"" as if the minds of her readers will explode if she doesn't repeatedly mention this. Plus, the excessive metaphors that she uses to explain female sexuality are more distracting than helpful. A couple here and there would be great, such as her accelerator-brake one, but there are so many that it takes away from the actual science of the subject. The way that she constantly addresses her readership is annoying too, and the book drags on because she continues to interrupt herself to ask the reader to reflect. Thanks for the coaching, but I am fully capable of wiping my own ass comprehending what I read!Nagoski always ends her chapters with a tl;dr, so I will do the same. The content of the book could be good if you know nothing about female sexuality and need a pep talk. The delivery annoyed the heck out of me."

This book truly is life changing...its title makes a bold claim but I'd say it doesn't go far enough...it'll not only transform your sex-life, it will transform your *entire* life if you let it. It's much more than a how-to sex manual or some biology textbook on how the female body works. The author, Emily Nagoski, gives us the red pill from the Matrix and reveals much more and does so in an amazingly engaging way...as if she's one of your best friends who's sat you down to have a deep talk...and some good laughs. You can really feel how much the author cares for both the women and men who read her book...which is a nice bonus.This is not one of those vague doctor-like, ""Hey, if you just remove stress, improve your self-esteem and amp up the romance you'll love sex!""...like, yeah, no kidding Sherlock...No, no, no...In this case, the author breaks down the fundamentals of the body, blows away myths, turns things on their head, describes various sex-life scenarios and then actually gives us strategies that *work*...work to do what, you ask? To make whatever you have, better. In her writing, the author pulls in a ton of science, research and proven psychological methods, lending credibility to her already credible background as a sex educator so you know what you're reading isn't fluff or some new fad psycho-babble.I think this is a fantastic book for any woman to read, from those who love their sex life to self-proclaimed sex experts to the clueless to the average to the asexuals to those who have female sexual dysfunction to those who are frustrated or bored or to those recovering from sexual trauma. The author is sensitive to all women and ""Come as you are"" is not just a clever throw away line for the title of her book.

Without going into too much detail about my own sexual issues (I know my loyal GR followers are thirsty for those juicy tidbits, but you'll have to buy me a beer first), I found this book incredibly educational. And not just involving sex and becoming more comfortable with your sexuality, but becoming comfortable with YOURSELF in general, and practicing self-compassion with all aspects of yourself. And that totally makes sense, because to be truly comfortable with sex, you need to be present and mindful, and that starts with working on yourself and being kind to yourself. How can you orgasm or enjoy sex if you hate yourself and feel like you're broken, or that there's something wrong with you?The author dispels a lot of myths involving sex which actually blew my mind. I always considered myself a relatively sex-positive and well-educated person in that sense, but there was actually so little that I knew, and so many misconceptions that I had.A few topics:- Arousal nonconcordance- Changing the context to enjoy sex- Spontaneous desire vs responsive desire- A lot of other things I'm too lazy to explain. You'll have to read the book yourself.Edit: I had to mention that this happens to be my 69th book read this year *chuckles immaturely*"

We have been programmed since a very young age with certain scripts and stories that we often do not realize how we label ourselves (our feelings, thoughts, behaviours) and others as normal and abnormal all the time, which is ridiculous if you really think about it. I especially liked the part about self-compassion and nonjudgement. I have already recommended it to many people around me; grab a copy!:)"

This is a comprehensive and engagingly written guide to how (mostly) cis women's sexuality works, both physiologically and mentally. Nagoski often uses metaphors of things like gardens to describe most of the scientific processes she mentions; not everyone will like this, but since I struggle to understand science I can't really visualize, it worked for me. This is a book I'd consider rereading in print to soak up some of the material I might have missed by listening to the audiobook. Some of the ""you are normal and beautiful and wonderful"" made me roll my eyes a little, but maybe the eye-rolling is what the patriarchy wants me to do. Note on the format: I listened to the audiobook, read by Nagoski. She does a fantastic reading, and there is even background music that I think was composed by her sister."
72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294085-david,Rating 5 out of 5,"""When people ask me, 'Am I normal?' they're asking, 'Do I belong?' The answer is Yes, you belong in your body. You belong in the world. You've belonged since the day you were born. This is your home. You don't have to earn it by conforming to some externally imposed sexual standard.""This book is so good. I cannot recommend it enough. I may not be the intended audience for whom sex educator Emily Nagoski writes (I am a heterosexual male), but my partners have been women, I have women in my family, as well as many female friends, and this book deepens my understanding of what cisgendered women have been subjected to, as well as what their biological experience is like. Plus, the sexual experience is a human experience, and I found myself not only learning from, but identifying with many of the key takeaways:* Arousal non-concordance, the mismatch that happens between the biological self (genitals) and the subjective self (thoughts/desires). ""I am totally turned on, but my equipment isn't quite in alignment,"" and vice versa. Non-concordance is normal and experienced by all genders, but women have a MUCH greater degree of non-concordance, and this is incredibly helpful to know when with partners. Non-concordance is also exacerbated in those who have experienced sexual trauma/abuse, such as I did as a really young boy. This helped crystallize so much of what I have experienced.* Learning to let go of shame and self-judgment around sexual preferences, desires, as well as letting go of the ""I should be..."" thoughts. As long as you are not hurting yourself or others, your fantasies and cravings are NORMAL. All of them. Enjoy.* We're all made of the same parts, just organized in different ways, and all unique to the individual. Everyone's body is equally lovable.* Orgasms. They can happen or not. And it's all normal. Change the goal from Must Orgasm, to Experience Pleasure.* The female experience. This, of course, is THE reason why Emily wrote this book. The messaging women have received since time immemorial regarding not only sex, but their biological bodies, is deplorable, even dangerous (the history and science of the Hymen is particularly eye-opening and disturbing).I can't say the messaging has been great to any gender, but it's clear women have not been allowed to be sexual beings, but rather sexual objects. I don't know if I'm guilty of contributing to this (I suppose I'm more Woke than Bro), but I now cannot un-see it and thus will always make better choices about my actions and words.There is so much more packed into this easily accessible book, that I'll leave the rest for you to discover. Emily's writing is clear, articulate, humorous, poignant, and above all, compassionate. She truly cares about this information reaching those it needs to reach -- which, IMO, is everyone.Learn about your partner. Learn about yourself. Learn about your kids. Learn about the world. Read this book and start positively changing the messaging we spread about sex. I mean, we wouldn't be here without it."
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1484853-simone,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is an amazing book. A must read for anyone with a vagina or people interested in being sexually involved with vagina have-ers. As Nagoski argues for too long we've basically thought about women's sexuality (when we think about it) as men's sexuality lite. There's a model of men's sexuality which is overwhelmingly fast-responsive and concordant, and when women's sexuality doesn't match that ideal it's considered broken. But this book is about more than just the science behind why women's sexuality is different than men's sexuality. Not better, not worse, just different. This book is warm, funny, and generous. Nagoski encourages women to own all their feelings and be gentle with themselves, not just with regard to their sexuality, but in all aspects of their lives. More than any other book on the science of sex that I've read this is a book that focuses on the context of feelings and why understanding that contexts matters. ""The day you were born, the world had a choice about what to teach you about your body. It could have taught you to live with confidence and joy inside your body. It could have taught you that your body and your sexuality are beautiful gifts. But instead, the world taught you to feel critical and dissatisfied with your sexuality and your body. You were taught to value and expect something from your sexuality that does not match what your sexuality actually is. You were told a story about what would happen in your sexual life, and that story was false. You were lied to. I am pissed, on your behalf, at the world for that lie. And I'm working to create a world that doesn't lie to women about their bodies anymore. I can't change the injury that the world inflicted on you, and neither can you. What you can do is heal. Like your genitals, your sexuality is perfect and beautiful exactly as it is. You are normal. Beautiful. And as long as you're not experiencing pain, you're healthy. So when you notice yourself feeling dissatisfied with your sexuality, when you notice shame or frustration or grief, allow yourself to direct those feelings away from yourself and instead focus the emotions toward the culture that told you the wrong story.""Indeed. Everyone please read this book and we can rage against the culture together. "

The anecdotes, the smarmy metaphors, the constant use of Star Trek style explanations (Like a balloon and...SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS.) It got on my nerves. A LOT. She started talking about sleepy hedgehogs, the little monitor, and rats who listen to Iggy Pop, as well as others. I would have been happier with the science, I forgot what ""sleepy hedgehog"" meant basically immediately. It was like she was writing to be That Cool Professor Who Gets You Kids. I make Iggy Pop references! Y'all get that, right? We're on the level?It's very monogamous. Not straight, so that's good, but not a book for someone who identifies as asexual. If I remember correctly, all the examples in the book were in a long term, sexual, life partnership. That got frustrating.So why 4 stars?It's a self-help book. This book is therapy. It's about accepting yourself. There was a refrain she kept saying, ""You are ok. You are normal,"" and every time it made me cry. Writing that right now made me cry. Stupid crying. Being told I'm ok is like the number one thing to make me form a little puddle on the ground and ache about how I don't actually feel ok.It's heartbreaking that women (or maybe people in general) have to be told that, but here we are. Sexual shame is insidious and infiltrates all sorts of parts of someone's life. Come to find out, that's ok. That's normal. Embrace it and make it a part of your story so that it doesn't remain shame forever but is simply part of your tapestry, an intricately woven web of a million influences forming to make a beautiful, sexual being, who has learned to turn around and say This is Me and I Am Lovable."

In the case of this book, part of that extra 50% is its own marketing -- which was kind of frustrating because I've already bought the book, so why are they still trying to sell me on it? The rest is a lot of repetition of things just stated. The other 50% also suffers because the writing is at points infantilising and talks down at the audience, which makes me wonder who Emily was thinking of when writing the book?In any case, she definitely did not have me in mind. Which is perfectly fine. But even though this wasn't written for me, and I found the way it was written particularly frustrating, I still think that some of the information in it is quite useful and would recommend it to certain people.What I think would be great though is if the information could be synthesised by someone else and turned into a 2-3 hour online class divided into short 10-15 minute bite-sized chapters.

88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5975841-stephanie,Rating 5 out of 5,"  Whether or not you are sexually active, have a desire or not to be sexually active ever, I highly recommend this book. It addresses sexuality and sex and so much more from a more scientific standpoint, without coming across as inaccessible because of the science. On the contrary, it is very accessible, with just the right amount of science and supporting anecdotes to really round it out.   On a more personal note, I found this book not only rather enlightening in a more general sense, but it also offered me a sense of relief and gratitude. One of the mantras goes “You are normal” – everyone is made of the same parts, just arranged in different ways. It helped me feel vindicated, in a way, as it drove home sneaking suspicions that I had been beginning to have about sex and sexual performance, all the while supporting it with the results of years of scientific sex and sex education research. It pretty well gave me the final tools to finish the undoing of negative ideas/views which had been planted in my head as I grew up (whether consciously or unconsciously) and were reinforced during my first (and, well, bad) relationship, and which I had been subsequently slowly hacking away at ever since then.   By and large, it goes to show and prove – successfully, I might add – how much context affects not only how we view sex, but also how we react/act in the moment as well. Ms. Nagoski offers up many different types of situations between her aggregate “characters” and the various pulled-from-real-life example she uses to illustrate different points. This variety helps support and confirm her points that everyone is made of the same stuff, just organized in a different way, and that you are normal despite what you may have been taught. It makes for rich and varied examples, to get an idea of just how many ways there are to be different yet normal, and how there is not really one “mold” into which everyone or even a majority (or even a minority!) will be able to fit.  In particular focus during one chapter, she even acknowledges – without any shying away from – the different filters through which we learn about sexuality such as the media, morality, and religion. The cultural context of sex is very much a “thing,” and something which we all have been doused in, though the exact proportions of that mixture is varies widely. There are some aspects of this cultural context which are flat out wrong – e.g. about the hymen being a sign of virginity – and have been used to enforce certain ideals – e.g. the “lack” of a hymen means a woman has has sex and is no longer a virgin. Ms. Nagoski goes through some of these examples, and details further the myth about the hymen as well as the scientific design and purpose (or really, lack thereof) of the hymen in women.  Ms. Nagoski covers this and so much more in Come as You Are, and it is well worth the time spent reading it, and also doing the little physical, emotional, and experiential examinations and reflections that she provides. I have recommended it to so many of my friends already, and I will keep wholeheartedly recommending it to anyone who has ever wondered, even for a moment, about any little thing regarding sex – the physical aspect, the emotional aspect, the cultural aspect, anything. Really, this is a must-read book for everyone, whether they have very little or quite a lot of experience with sex and all it entails. Single, married, gay, asexual, everyone can benefit in some way from reading Come as You Are. And if you are looking for futher reading, or to read the studies and cases she reference, there is a lenghty and accessible list of references at the back for further information.Favorite Quotes/Ideas:  This may be the most important consequence of understanding the way context influences how your brain processes sexually relevant stimuli: When sex doesn’t feel great, it doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you. Maybe there’s been a change in your external circumstances or your other motivational systems (like stress) that’s influencing your sexual response. Which means that you can create positive change without changing you. – page 91  But in modern culture, there’s a contradiction built into the social remedies to stress. On the one hand, being around other people is often a core part of allowing our stress response to complete, particularly for women. On the other hand, we put the brakes on, self-inhibiting our stress response, in order to stay socially appropriate and not make other people uncomfortable. We hold on to our incomplete stress response in order to access the security of being with our tribe.  And, of course, this contradiction is even more pronounced for women, who are the culturally sanctioned “managers of relationships.” When the going gets tough in a heterosexual relationship, it often falls to the woman to rein in her own stress response, in order to create space for the man to feel his Feels. In other words, if there is stress in a relationship, cultural rules make it likely to impact the woman more than the man, and it’s likely to impact her sexual interest and response. And because she has to hold on to her stress, so that her partner can let his go, she is more likely to become stuck in her stress, while he moves through his. – page 145  Emotional pain is exhausting, and sometimes it’s necessary to take a break from the pain, numb out for a while. Just remember what happens when the sedated lion comes out from under anesthesia. The cycle has to complete, it wants to complete. Self-compassion is being patient with yourself through that process—and being patient with yourself when you need to take a break. – page 179  And even though I’d love you to find meaning in every page, every paragraph of this book, cherry-pick from here, too. We’re all different, so what’s relevant for you is definitely, absolutely not the same as what’s relevant for me or for any of the many hundreds of women I’ve taught. Take what’s relevant. Ignore what isn’t; it’s there for somebody else who needs it. – page 185  Genital response doesn’t mean anything but sexually relevant--expecting, essentially a conditioned reflex—not enjoying. It doesn’t indicate desire or pleasure or anything else. And by carving out space, once and for all, for nonconcordance, we’re actually making the world a better place for everyone. – page 205  But pathologizing responsive desire as low desire isn’t the worst consequence of the sex-as-drive myth. There’s a larger social justice reason for sex educators’ fighting against the myth of sex as a drive for more than a hundred years. A far worse consequence is that when sex is conceptualized as a need, it creates an environment that fosters men’s sense of sexual entitlement. […] Because if sex is a drive, like hunger, then potential partners are like food. Or like animals to be hunted for food.  And that’s both factually incorrect and just wrong. – page 232  Give Partner B space and time away from sex. Let sex drop away from your relationship—for a little while—and be there, fully present, emotionally and physically. Lavish your partner with affection, on the understanding that affection is not a preamble to sex. Be warm and generous with your love. You won’t run out.  Put simply, the best way to deal with differential desire is: Be kind to each other. – page 255  […B]ut more importantly I gained a radically more healthful attitude: that a woman’s body and her pleasure belong to her and no one else; that it’s possible to say no to intercourse without saying no to all other things that come with it—the love and the affection and the pleasure and the play; and that my own internal experience was a legitimate guide for whether or not I wanted to try something. – page 305"

I'm really glad I got over myself, because this book is fantastic.There's a lot of science referenced here, which she footnotes so you can dig even further if you want. And the science is stuff above, beyond, and more recent than what I learned in high school and college. Which is why I was constantly amazed that what I learned (in the classroom, and by living in society) was so very wrong. The crux of why is that sex has been studied and understood as a men-as-default thing, which by nature sets up the differences between the sexes as ""women are broken"". The truth, as the author repeats often, is that there is no default or normal, and as long as you aren't experiencing pain with sex, your sexuality is healthy and normal. She goes into the biological aspects (how we all have the same parts, arranged in different ways), the psychological aspects (how control centers in the brain act as taskmasters and why we experience frustration, orgasm, nonconcordance, etc), the physiological aspects (how you feel about how you feel during sex, for example, being a huge detractor from enjoying the experience), the cultural aspects (contrary to social shorthand, sex is NOT a drive), etc. She throws in anecdotes as well, which I found helpful in breaking up the science parts and giving me a context for real-life application. She also has worksheets and suggestions about addressing any of a myriad of issues, which she encounters commonly as a human sexuality educator. Occasionally, as the book goes on, her repeating of phrases and question/answer posing felt a little too ""in the classroom"" to me...I didn't feel like she was speaking down to me, necessarily, but it made me twitch just a bit.Overall, I really enjoyed this book: I learned a lot, it empowered me to improve some areas of my sexuality that I've been unsatisfied with (and did that beyond platitudes, with actual, practical advice), and it made me realize the root of some of my core issues (not just as pertains to sex, but with my self-esteem, my self-definition as an adult woman, my relationship fears, etc). I guarantee you, even if you're 100% happy with your sexuality and body, you'll still get something out of this book. And while the tone is definitely specifically aimed at women, it's got a lot of info in there useful to men (in understanding their own biology, brain relationship to sexuality, etc)."

There are two main aspects that the book is split into: (1) exactly how sexuality is studied and thought about from a current scientific and psychological standpoint, and how that’s different from what our common perceptions of sexuality is like (2) how one’s mental health and mindframes largely impact one’s sexual experiences, and solutions to develop a healthier outlook and manage emotions better with specificity on better sexual health For people who have already worked on mental health from a CBT or DBT approach and/or have practiced mindfulness and meditation, the latter part of this book will be very familiar."

Each concept covered was empowering, normalizing, and embodied. This book is about way more than sex, but about how to live confidently and joyfully in your body, even in a culture that has taught us to see our bodies as not enough, broken, always in need of fixing/improvement. I loved the incorporation of practices like mindfulness, non-judging, completing the stress cycle and trusting the wisdom of your body.P.S. go watch Emily Nagoski’s Ted Talk: “The Truth about Unwanted Arousal.” I’ve witnessed how powerful and transformative the knowledge about arousal nonconcordance can be, especially in work with survivors, and I want everyone to know about it and spread the word!Okay one critique - while many of the metaphors used throughout the book are helpful and make concepts clear, there were a LOT of them and during at least one point (the salad bar metaphor I think?), I definitely got lost."

Išties daug naudingos informacijos ! Emily atskleidžia, kaip glaudžiai susijusi smegenų veikla ir gyvenimo būdas bei kaip tai įtakoja jūsų seksualumą. Vienas dalykas, kas man užkliuvo - tas perdėm draugiškas pasakojimo tonas. Kai mokslas nustumiamas į pavėsį ir dalykus bandoma aiškinti taip paprastai lyg skaitytojas būtų kvailas. Tai man labai neskanu. Šiuolaikinės moterys emancipuotos, protingos ir nereikia į jas žiūrėti iš aukšto ir pasakoti viską tarsi mažam vaikui apie tai iš kur atsiranda vaikai: žinai, nueina mamytė ir tėvelis į daržą ir randa tave kopūstuose... come on! Taigi, man tas supaprastinimas nepatiko.Vis tik knygą rekomenduočiau moterims, kurioms iškyla klausimas “ar aš normali”. Atsakymas, aišku, bus, kad tikrai normali, bet perskaityti visa tai vistiek reikia. Ką ši knyga gali po savęs palikti - tai didesnį bagažą žinių ir ramybę, kad viskas su tavimi gerai.

But if you're a woman wondering whether or not you're a ""normal"" sexual being, or struggling with anything related to sex (desire, arousal, orgasm...), read it! It's a little gem - deeply human and witty. Also, if you're a guy (or gal for that matter), wondering if your partner's broken - yes, read it! And for you, the best part is that Emily has short summaries at the end of each chapter, so you only need to go through those to start connecting to your partner's issues in a healthier way.Most of all, this book is not just about sex, but it's mostly about how our emotional mind works in a sexual context. And there's tons of information about how to manage your emotions, create better contexts and live happier sex lives. In short, here are my top 3 favorite things about this book:1. Research based - she's got a Ph.D. on the topic and has been researching and teaching it for 20 years2. Brilliant metaphors - they make dry concepts come alive and stick, so I can't wait to use them in my trainings or 1-2-1 sessions3. Practical - no bullshit, simple, funny and clear"
99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101833146-dani-d-nyi,Rating 5 out of 5,"Curiosity gets you places. In this case, I read a women's sex-ed book, and it turned out to be spot on. Emily Nagoski's writing is informed and direct, backed up with 20-odd years' field work and research. She does not muck about: the book is as to-the point as the genre allows, with plenty of repetition dropped at the right cues, and case study stories that are relevant (and conveniently fictitious) illustrations to thoroughly instructive lessons, along with questionnaires and excercises. It reads like a textbook for home instruction.As a male, I probably felt a different fascination than the default target audience of women, though it didn't prevent me from reading all of this attentively. Being unattached to the physiological workings of female bodies does not make this knowledge less relevant I think, and at the end of the day it is largely compatible with my non-female experience of sex, emotions and culture. We are all, as Nagoski keeps telling us, all made of the same parts, but arranged in different ways - not that I'd take that out of context.Everyone with a sexlife should benefit from reading (and discussing, and practising) this book. Also, I can't help wondering if any similar scientific and non-judgmental work is out there on male sexuality as it is in practice. But the basics are, as far as I see, neatly dealt with for all concerned."

I was first introduced to Emily Nagoski when she was interviewed on the Nerdist podcast Sex Nerd Sandra, and I have been waiting to get my hands on Come As You Are since the first sentence she uttered on that show. I was so excited to find that her voice moved easily from radio to page, and I have to tell you, I have never recommended anything to EVERYONE IN THE WORLD more strongly. Yes. Literally everyone. This is not your average, run of the mill self-help book. This is a beautifully researched compendium by a PhD'd sex educator. Her voice is a fun, millennial-friendly one full of nerdy Tumblr-esque references and fantastic analogies that will have you exclaiming 'that makes so much sense!' every few pages. Nagoski also acknowledges the experience of all kinds of women, including survivors of trauma. She addresses but peels away all of the judgement strewn about in our culture about women's bodies and sexualities, in all its diversity. She is sex-positive and body-positive. I am a changed person for reading this book, and if I won the lottery tomorrow I would probably buy a copy for every single person I know. Yes. You read that right. /endfangirlrant "

112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105625565-aaron-weinberg,Rating 4 out of 5,"Preceded by cutting edge research and 19th century feminist literature, Nagoski's Come as You Are transpires as a modern take on how sexuality - women's in particular - is heavily in conjunction with the broader cultural and political dynamics of our society. While shedding light on the problems - distorted understandings of psychology and biology, and the effects this can have on a woman’s relationship with her body and self - Nagoski provides a consistently succinct and intricate guide as to how to go about correctly addressing one's own sexual wellbeing and relationship.The book is realistically a self-help therapy book, which is to a certain extent substantiated by effective research and some scientific analysis. But Nagoski is pretty open about her intentions in sacrificing some sense of ‘scientific sophistication’ to create a more relatable, engaging and inspiring contention. I personally couldn't fully engage with all the content, due to the target demographic of women, and at times her babying-like tone. Nonetheless I still found her points illuminating, enlightening us on ideas and research that a lot of people haven’t heard and a lot of people need to hear. Her extensive use of metaphors, despite their somewhat overuse, came across as quite witty and effective, while the anecdotes of her students and peers gives the text a more relatable and genuine quality and carry some of her most insightful points.With some drops of general wisdom along the way, Nagoski uses sexuality to foreground the fight for truth - for self-truth - as something born in both a counter-culture ethos and the willingness to embrace what is truly internal, championing for self-acceptance towards one’s own body, health, and life. The tone is feminine; the message is real; and while the book targets a female audience, Nagoski provides all the more reason for dudes to engage with it."

I finished reading it in July and began this review in August. And I'm here today to finally get it to the finish line. What has taken me so long? This isn't just your run-of-the-mill book review procrastination, nay, I have a confession to make. I am 41 years old, and I am super duper uncomfortable talking about sex. But I finally bit the bullet and posted a reel review to Instagram where it will live on the internet, so writing this review should be a cakewalk. (Sort of. But it's still scary. But here I am).I came upon this book by the recommendation of my therapist and my friend, who is also a therapist, so I guess we could say 2 out of 2 therapists (that Ashlie knows) recommend this book. It is an examination and dismantling of female sexuality by Nagoski, who is an expert on the topic. She makes reading a book about a topic that might make you uncomfortable about as pleasant as it can be.The main flashing neon sign to take away is that whatever you've heard about ""sex drive"" or what women are supposed to do/be/feel like is flaming hot trash. Sexuality is as individual as a fingerprint and nothing about what you like, need or how your body and mind react is wrong or bad (She shouts and waves her fist at Catholicism and the patriarchy who strongly beg to differ). My whole life I've wondered why I can't be like people in movies and TV, who are just ready to hop in the sack. Well, Nagoski distinguishes between ""spontaneous desire,"" i.e., hopping in, and ""responsive desire,"" i.e. context matters greatly. And one isn't right and the other wrong, it's just different.The book has excerpts from patients as well as exercises you can do to examine and unpack your own experience. There is a companion workbook that I have, but haven't filled out yet, which I'm sure is just as useful.If you a) are a woman or b) want to have a better understanding of modern women's sexuality, pick up this book. And if it takes you eight months to read it, well you are in excellent company."

123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/611031-kater-cheek,Rating 3 out of 5,"My general rule of thumb for non-fiction is that if I learn one new thing that changes my view of the world, it's worth the time it took to read it. I certainly learned some important things about women's sexuality in this book. How could I not? As Nagoski says, women's sexuality in this culture is usually depicted as ""exactly like men's, only not as good."" It's no big secret that there's a lot of baggage surrounding cultural expectations of women's sexuality. We're told practically from birth that we are sex objects, and that we should simultaneously live up to this and fight against this. We should enjoy sex enthusiastically and also never enjoy sex. We're lied to again and again, sometimes in ridiculous ways. One of the biggest eye-openers in this book was exposing the lie that a woman's body-response or lack of response to a sexually charged situation reflects her mental state. That is, if a woman says she's ready for sex but she's not wet, it doesn't mean she's lying. If a woman is wet but says she's not turned on, it also doesn't mean she's lying. Just because a woman got wet (or even orgasmed) during rape does not mean that she ""secretly wanted it"" any more than a boy having an erection watching a nature video means that he secretly craves hot monkey love or that a middle-aged man not being able to get it up while in the presence of a beautiful woman means that he's suddenly become gay. We don't claim those men are lying, but our culture has so many terrible ideas around women and sex that the default answer is usually ""whatever she's doing is wrong."" It's kind of like parenting in that way. Doesn't matter what you do, it's wrong.Nagoski offers a few tips for how to get past these blocks. She uses the metaphors of ""accelerator"" (things that make a person aroused) and ""brake"" (things/situations that stop arousal.) A pink Viagra hasn't been invented because most of the time if a woman isn't having the amount of sex she wants it's not because of physiological issues. She gives a few pointers on how to get through the stress cycle so that stress won't put the brakes on (animals fleeing danger rarely stop to get nookie. Stress frequently tamps down on non-essential activities, such as getting aroused.) She has a few pointers on how to combat that age-old problem of differing sex drives between couples.She also fights against the notion of sex as a ""drive."" It's like curiosity. People are healthier if they can indulge in it, and generally are born with a desire for it, but not satisfying your desire for sex won't cause any tissue damage, nor will it kill you any more than not finding out how that mystery novel ended will kill you. You might want it real bad, but it's not a need like food or sleep. This is an insidious myth, especially when it plays into my pet peeve of the people who teach their boys and girls that a woman is put on earth to satisfy men's ""need"" for sex.Some of how the book is structured is useful. Some is less useful. It has sections on physiology, neurology, and psychology. It has notes sections to fill in your own experiences, which I generally dislike (and also dislike in this situation.) It feels like pointless fill, a waste of paper. Nagoski uses very modern language, such as tl;dr sections at the end for people who want a summary of the chapter. She also has the tendency to introduce characters as examples, then cut off before she answers their question with a ""we'll answer that in Chapter X.""The most frustrating thing about this book were that not all of the metaphors worked for me. Some of them did, such as the brake and accelerator. Others just confused me. She talked about an internal ""monitor"" but I never was able to grasp that. I understood it a little better when she brought in the map/terrain discrepancy analogy, but I never liked the ""monitor"" metaphor. I also didn't like the ""emotion is like a tunnel, you have to get through it."" She brought up the ""you have to get through your emotions"" point more than once, emphasizing it as crucially important to a healthy life of any way, but it just plain did not make sense to me. Neither did ""treat your sexuality gently and with kindness, like a sleepy hedgehog."" I just can't make good use of that.This book was valuable to me because I haven't read many books about women's sexuality so I got a lot of insightful ideas to think about. Her writing isn't perfect, but her research was completely new to me, so it was worth a little bit of confusion."

127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58893144-bossi,Rating 3 out of 5,"I'll start by saying that I'm probably not the target audience here. I'd say it's first and foremost a book for women's health (physical as well as mental/emotional), and when it comes to men: the ones who would get the most from reading it are unfortunately those least likely to do so.I believe it is likely an excellent book if you have any sense of discomfort in being who you are (which does not describe me in the slightest, hence why I think I found it difficult for me to fully engage with it) and I did take away some interesting considerations, such as how one can be against + fear rape but can yet have pleasurable rape fantasies. I love such dichotomies, and the book does an excellent job describing the thought processes behind it.However, there were also chapters that I felt I could not agree with in full, such as chapter 5's ""health at every size"" wherein I agree that mental health is very important, but there are indeed very real physical issues correlated with being both significantly underweight as well as overweight, and the book seems to brush such issues aside in favor of mental health.There were also a number of sections that suggest that if you habitually treat a young child a certain way it will have a profound influence on their behavior as adults. While not unreasonable a hypothesis, I would love to follow the research to both verify as well as learn more on something I found interesting, if true.Which brings me to more technical criticisms: egads, the book's use of endnotes. Footnotes are better than endnotes any day. Or at the least put the chapter at the top of every page if the endnotes are going to be organised by chapter. It was maddeningly difficult following the endnotes.And from a writing style: about two thirds of the book seems to consist of saying what has been covered in previous chapters or what is going to be covered in future chapters. It perhaps makes it more informal / conversational, but as an engineer I couldn't help but think at how the book could get away with so much less paper if it trimmed out everything that wasn't core substance.Bottom line-If you are interested in exploring your self-identity or have anything less than overwhelming confidence in yourself, if you're looking to expand upon your sexual id, if you're seeking to connect more deeply with a partner, if you have any interest in learning more about women's health, or if you have ever thought of how mysterious women seem to be and how could one ever understand a feminine mind: this book is probably something you should read.(side-note: no men approached me while reading this, but a number of women did. About 2/3 were excited and glad I was reading it, or were looking forward to reading it themselves. About 1/3 were irate over the cover, or in one case she was angry over the visibility of some anatomical sketches in one of the earlier chapters. That One Third *really* needs to read this book.)"
128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5972121-charlotte-fox,Rating 3 out of 5,"Buzzed through this one. Here is my flurry of thoughts. I appreciated the intro - don’t skip this! It is critical to lay out the terms and definitions including gender vs. biological sex, especially when one is referring to cis-gendered women 99% of the time throughout the rest of their book. Overall, this book is about empowering women to take control of their sexuality and bodies, especially as “…so many of us were raised to believe other people’s opinions about our bodies - more than we believe our own internal experiences.” This read was validating to be sure. But by chapter 7 I was sick of Nagoski saying everything (namely your body or anything it does) is ‘beautiful’ and ‘perfect’ and ‘amazing’. These things are subjective. And let’s be real. Human genitalia is all pretty weird. Is the female body amazing? Absolutely. But don’t push it.Also, beginning in the earliest chapters, I was unsure of the use of the word “normal” - Nagoski repeats (and then repeats again) that your body and feelings are normal. Perhaps “typical” may have been a better term. I don’t believe normal truly exists. And near the end of the book, to further irritate me, Nagoski defined normal as “to feel that you belong”. Hmm. But perhaps I’m being overly semantic here. Ultimately, will this so-called new science transform my sex life? No. The title is a bit click bait-y in that sense. Some of Nagoski’s most tangible tips are irritatingly simplistic and obvious. Worried about kids walking in? Get a babysitter! Cold feet? Put on socks! Don’t like the lights on? Turn them off! Ugh. But I will say I enjoyed learning about the science behind topics such as sexual (non)concordance that Nagoski held my hand through. 2.5/5. I could have survived on the best bits of science and all the TL;DRs at the end of each section. First half was definitely better than the second. All the metaphors were killing me by the end - gardens, hot water heaters, flocks of birds…I’m a grown ass woman. Just talk to me straight. My TL;DR for Come As You Are:Cis-gendered women are normal, we just have our parts organized in different ways; trust your body; and, one must turn off the offs and turn on the ons to improve solo or partner sex.

It’s one of those books that try too hard to convey research in a relatable way. The information’s ok & the research is worth looking into. But, I have a problem when intelligent authors assume that their readers are stupid. This is not a scientific book about sex. It’s condescending & it infantilizes its readers. This is especially annoying to me because the book is written for women. I hate to type the obvious, but women can read research. There is no need for silly metaphors after we pass the age of six. We don’t need to imagine that our brains are like a flock of birds or that our sexuality is like an overgrown garden. I think the book is mostly about providing advice and encouragement to women who want to have fun, but can’t read anything complex about sex health. I find that assumption offensive. I am again stating the obvious here, but fun content does not have to be dumb. Even Playboy knew this. The magazine, for many years, had very high-quality editorial content. Vonnegut, Atwood, Kerouac, Capote, Mailer, Palahniuk & Bradbury wrote for Playboy and none of them assumed that their (mostly) male audience needed to be warned that, and I quote: “it gets pretty nerdy here”. Or, after some science part, to be told: “Did you make it? Whew! That was the hard part. Nice job”. Or use the word “feels”, instead of “emotions.” That’s how Dr. Nagoski talks to her (assumed female) readers. I strongly dislike the underlying belief that most women are not interested in and cannot read hard science or interpret research data. We can, and many of us do. Maybe, this book is more appropriate for teenage girls, but even then, I would think that the tone is condescending. “For realsie real” - to use Nagoski’s words - my personal opinion is that women want, and deserve, much better written books about sex than this.

The kind of book so packed with useful information that you want to give it to every woman you know (as well as everyone you know who sleeps with women). Different parts will be more or less relevant to you, but as someone who's currently not in a long-term relationship, I know I'll want to re-read several sections when I find myself in one and going through one of those droughts that tend to happen.There are a lot of metaphors here, but I liked that it allowed you a lot of ways to view the situation until you found one that made sense. The Accelerator/Brakes is incredibly useful and can make a lot of conversations easier. I know so many women who struggle with their sexual relationships and I just want to give this to all of them. I give 4 stars instead of 5 because while I find the data incredibly useful and relevant, I still feel like there was untapped potential here to refine some of the ideas/devices and the 5 composite characters could be hard for me to keep straight.

Hell, you don't even have to have a sex life at all, to read it! Because it's not a book about sex. And it's not a book just about women! It's about self-care, mindfulness, growth, emotions, happiness, authenticity, self love, self acceptance and much more! It's about being normal, being enough, just as you are, man or woman or gender neutral or asexual. It's a book that teaches once more about non judgment and love.And this is a quote I absolutely love, that applies not just to this book, but to any piece of information out there, and moreover, to every single human interaction: ""We’re all different, so what’s relevant for you is definitely, absolutely not the same as what’s relevant for me [...] Take what’s relevant.

Yeah, you need to read this. One note, however. If you, like me, have been blaming yourself for everything under the sun your whole life, it will be difficult to read. If you avoid hugs because they make you cry, if words get stuck in your throat until you feel like you're suffocating, you have to read this. You won't enjoy it, not really, but you need it."

Men and women, go get yourself a copy. The only folk for whom this book might feel troubling is non-binary folk and trans folk because the language is very much women = vulva/labia/vagina and men = all the other stuff.

I want to recommend this book to everyone, sexually active or not, because I think the information is useful.

När Nagoski skriver om sexualitet handlar det alltså inte bara om vad som händer i sängen och hur det känns utan minst lika mycket om att godkänna sig själv och sina känslor och hur man känner inför sina känslor. Det märks att hon jobbat länge som både forskare och sexualupplysare – folkbildarkänslan är stark och hon är oerhört skicklig på att förklara invecklade processer på ett begripligt sätt. Mer livskunskap än sexualkunskap, som sagt – rekommenderar den i synnerhet till alla kvinnor och flickor."

She is clear, succinct, and incredibly, effortlessly funny. This book is essentially Sex Ed 101, a necessary addition to the world because people get so much about sex so wrong. One of Nagoski's main points is that we're all different, our bodies, the ease with which we get aroused, etc., and that that's okay. Her aim is not to provide new techniques but to normalize our feelings and to show us how to clear away the emotional barriers and cultural messages that get in our way. "

Women are supposed to be this way, that way, a bit like this, but not too much because it won't do, etc, etc. It's the same concerning their sexuality. Emily Nagoski explains, in this book, how feminine sexuality ""works"", and it's both fascinating and satisfying, while being annoying. Not because of what she says, but because WHY THE HECK DID NO ONE TOLD WOMEN THIS BEFORE? The author frees women of guilt explaining why they are in this or that situation, why they feel like this or like that, why this doesn't work, why this doesn't feel right, etc. It was liberating. And repeating that women are all normal is liberating too. With this book, women can finally understand themselves. I loved Come as You Are, be it the scientific parts, the psychological parts, the testimony parts, the personal parts. Different women talk about their sexual life, be they the author herself or women she knows. I think every woman can recognize herself in this book. It was safe, it was great.P.S.: it made me think about

Ő csak azt akarta őszintén kommunikálni nőtársai felé, hogy attól, mert bár közel egyforma intim testrészekkel rendelkezünk még az működhet totál másképpen sőt eltérően, mint amit az átlagnak, vagy a társadalmilag elvártnak gondolunk. De ez nem azt jelenti, hogy valami nincs rendben velünk. Sőt, éljen a változatosság: higgyük csak el, hogy a társadalmilag ránk kényszerített elvárások alaptalanok, nincs egy sztenderd aminek meg kell felelnünk és ha ez nem így van, akkor jobb, ha elássuk magunkat. Dehogy: inkább ismerjük meg a felszerelésünket, keressük meg a mozgatórugóit és próbálkozzunk a beüzemeléssel, s ha valami működik, akkor hajrá, használjuk úgy. Szóval ebben rejlik az ő nagy titka és sikere: őszinteség és elfogadás amit egyrészt magával szemben is elvár, de alkalmazza a gyakorlatban is (szexuális oktatással, felvilágosítással és támogatással foglalkozik) sőt az olvasói felé is ezt kommunikálja a könyvben.Részletesen: http://olvasonaplo.net/olvasonaplo/20..."

However, the writing can be so so SOOOOO awful. The author leans into validation so hard it can come across like a preachy self help book, and the author constantly is referencing stuff that you’ll read about later with the emphasis on when you’ll see it again. Like girlie i do not CARE that we’ll get into it more in chapter 7, i’ll figure that out on my own when we actually get there and I read it myself. The book also advertises itself as being science focused, and like there’s definitely science in here, but it’s delivered in a super simplified way. Sometimes this was really helpful because too many technical terms loses me, but sometimes it just felt….corny and unhelpful.The writing got so grating that i wanted to rate this even lower, but unfortunately, i am a broken brain bitch who needed to hear the actual content of this book very much so count yourself lucky, Ms. Nagoski!!"

I liked learning more about context, breaks/distractibility, nonconcordance, and her catchphrase ""the same parts, organized differently"" (which drives the point well). Nagoski writes in an approachable albeit ""rah rah rah!, women are special!"" voice that can sometimes grate the reader. At the same time, I also get her POV and attitude: many women have been taught that they are not normal and she is trying to change that script. Obviously as this is a general look at a variety of topics, some were more important to me than others. The sprinkling of ""stories"" sometimes confused me as I couldn't remember which woman's experience was attached to which name."

There was a lot here I either didn't know, or that was reframed in such a way that there was a bit of a lightbulb moment. Even a couple of moments that had me tearing up. Really recommend this one.However, this is definitely meant for cis women, which the author makes clear up front, and it didn't feel like there was a ton of intersectionality--queer inclusive but mostly meant for straight women, and it feels very white-centric, with nothing really addressing the ways in which cultural messaging and conditioning differs for Black woman, and other women of color.

160,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14945161-sandy-maguire,Rating 3 out of 5,"I read this on the recommendation of a friend who suggested it might help clear things up for me. She winked when she said it. And so, as a man, I realize I am not the target audience, which makes this a difficult thing to review.The good: several of my female friends have told me that this book changed their lives. Evidently there is good advice here, and it definitely cleared up some misconceptions I had around women's sexuality. To that extent, if you can suspend your disbelief, this is probably a great read.The bad: I mentioned suspension of disbelief. Nagoski often refers to ""the science,"" claiming that whatever study proves her point. However, my overwhelming feeling throughout the book was that Nagoski had ideas that empirically seemed to work out, and was trying to justify them through the literature. While there are quite a few citations (none of which I followed up on), the studies she describes simply /reek/ of bad science. They are either studies about rats that she's extrapolated to human behavior, or they are unreplicated studies of n<50. This is a classic failure mode in the search for truth; mining the literature for claims that support an a priori belief, rather than synthesizing the literature into a coherent worldview.While the facade of science probably lends an air of legitimacy to what otherwise would be a book of just-so stories, it completely falls flat to a scientifically-minded audience. And so I'm stymied here. Nagoski's methods are clearly bunk, but due to how many people I know personally whom have been helped by this book, I feel that I need to credit where it's due. Should you get points for accidentally being right, even if your methods are completely wrong?Another gripe: the prose here is rather egregious. It comes off a lot like having a chat-room conversation back in the early 2000s. For example, Nagoski doesn't seem to know the word ""feelings,"" and instead, exclusively refers to ""getting the Feels."" There are a lot of strained analogies to popular culture, almost none of which I was familiar with --- and the ones I was, the metaphor didn't really connect. For example, she spent a few pages describing the plot of Groundhog Day, and then when she got around to her point, it really didn't seem to be related to Groundhog Day at all! I think it was about ""why do vaginal and clitoral orgasms feel different from one another if they are REALLY AND TRULY JUST THE SAME THING?"" but I can't remember.Relatedly, the book espouses particularly bad ontology. As alluded to above, Nagoski decides by fiat that ALL ORGASMS ARE THE SAME. She adopts a non-standard definition of orgasm, and justifies this claim based on her new definition. She says, if you notice a distinction between vaginal and clitoral orgasms, that you are wrong. Because they are the same thing. ""And besides, every orgasm is different from one another, so why differentiate?"" Nagoski makes this misstep many times throughout the book. Maybe it's just me splitting hairs, but she willingly and oftentimes redefines a word. Clearly she is attempting to remove stigma or get past some cultural blocks, or whatever, but make no mistake --- this is the work of a marketer, not a researcher. Nagoski evidently has something to sell here, which she admits, but it's unclear whether she's aware she's doing this, or whether her thinking really is this sloppy. Like it or not, words mean something, and we use them because they usefully carve distinctions that we'd like to make. It's fine to show us that these distinctions are mistaking the forest for the trees, but a better approach than saying ""you're wrong, orgasm doesn't REALLY mean that"" is ""here's a better word that better carves reality at its joints.""The ugly: the major takeaway of this book seems to be ""no matter what your sexuality is, it's normal."" There's a lot of dark-arts psychology in the prose of this book, in an attempt to reassure the reader that they are ""not broken."" My initial, uncharitable response to this was ""what sort of sad, weak person needs to seek reassurance from this?"" But then I remembered the women who have praised this book to me, and quite a number of them are remarkably strong, wildly inspiring humans.As such, I have reconsidered my view, and instead interpret the book's reaffirming attitude as evidence of just how fucked up women's sexuality must be in our culture. As a man, this is never going to be a thing I will experience first-hand, so any evidence is helpful to gain an honest understanding here. Maybe it's not weak people who feel that they're broken; maybe it's just everyone. If so, I guess I can get onboard with the book's approach, but it still feels a bit dishonest.Overall, if you are like me, this book probably isn't a great investment of your time. There are definitely things to be learned here, but the vast majority of it is an owner's guide to contextualizing women's sexuality. My primary takeaways are that the expectation of sex leads to sexual excitement, regardless of whether or not the brain is into it --- and that getting rid of the expectation of sex from intimate touching can help alleviate stress and, paradoxically, lead to significantly better sex."

175,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20599323-emily,Rating 5 out of 5,"If you are a gender studies or sexuality studies major or perhaps you've spent years exploring your sexuality in a safe and open environment - this isn't likely going to be a refresher although you may learn some cool science facts. But for the rest of us...this is a jaw-dropping, science-based unveiling of understanding women's sexuality. Come as you are has one critical message, in my opinion, and that is ""We are all the same. We are all different. We are all normal."" Emily Nagoski spends time breaking down science (particularly biology and anatomy and how they come together, as well as our brains and how they work). ""What matters most is not the parts you are made of or how they are organised, but how you feel about those parts. When you embrace your sexuality precisely as it is right now, that's the context that creates the greatest potential for ecstatic pleasure."" And I don't know about you, but that sounds freeing - that sounds attainable - that sounds beautiful. So what will you learn in about 300 pages about sexuality?The biggest lesson I learned was about the dual-control model - our accelerator and our brakes. The things that revv us up and really slow us down. By better understanding our own accelerators and brakes as well as those of our partners, we can learn how to create the sensuality and sexuality in our lives. While we learn about arousal, desire, orgasm - this book is about more than sex. We learn about stress cycles (if you haven't read Burn Out - you definitely should) and how our stress and emotions impact our lives (and our sex lives). She talks about attachment styles, trauma, self-compassion (and our inner critic), confidence and joy.You'll come away from this book knowing that you are normal. That you can let go of everything that is holding you back (and wow is there a long list) to welcome your sexuality - as it is today which is perfect as it is.Thank you, Emily Nagoski, for writing this book. This should be required reading for all women and partners of women. "

177,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/168456-kyle-wendy-skultety-gimmethatbook-com,Rating 5 out of 5,"This review originally appeared on my blog at www.gimmethatbook.com.I won this book through a Goodreads giveaway! Thanks to Emily Nagoski and Simon & Schuster for contributing the book in exchange for an honest review.There are many books out there claiming to be the best source of knowledge about the female body; but this one is pretty much on the money. Nagoski talks honestly about what women experience, and why. Her tenet is: we are all alike, but different, we are all normal.Women may get their knowledge from social media, and therefore have an unrealistic image to live up to. Women may feel “broken” because their bodies don’t react the way they think they should. This feeling is insidious and permeates the brain and hinders sexual pleasure.Nagoski explains that women have a “brake” and an “accelerator” and that they need to be aware of what hits them, in essence. She talks about “spectatoring” (thinking about yourself in a denigrating way during sex, effectively hitting your brake) and discusses how to love your body.COME AS YOU ARE is an uplifting, celebrating, and positive book that all women should read. The ideas she puts forth are simple, and she includes worksheets and questions in the book that the reader can use to help them along their journey to better self awareness.The author includes a chapter on anatomy, which is very thorough and should educate even the most sexually aware person! She also debunks the myths that women’s pleasure is secondary to men’s, or that the purpose of a female is just to procreate. Her message gives women power on every page.Intertwined with Nagoski’s wisdom are 4 fictional women, each experiencing a different problem. As the book progresses, each woman’s relationship progresses, concurrent with what the author is saying. This way the reader can see how the principles are applied in real life.What makes this book different from other self help books is that the solutions are put forth for both the mind and the body. It won’t matter if your sex drive is low or high, as the tenets will make many women feel better, both about themselves and about what they feel. Education goes a long way, and this is the author’s aim: to let women know they are normal, while teaching them why this is so. There can be no better message, especially in these times where the average female has a lot of negativity surrounding her. Every woman should read this book, then give it to their partner. There would be more happiness in the world if that occurred."
178,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40702162-kathleen,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is one of the most impactful books I have ever read. It took me a long time to pick it up, but I steeled my resolve because I was confident it would help me fix myself. And, thanks to Nagoski, I'm now confident that the key thing I need to change is my perception being sexually broken. Nagoski's writing style is the perfect combination of nerdy scientist, seasoned sex therapist, and sassy best friend to pull off a book that warmly and directly deconstructs how women experience sex. She is a master of metaphors - sex and thinking about sex is compared to a garden, a flock of birds, running from lions, Lord of the Rings, car mechanics, restaurant browsing - which destigmatizes the concepts she introduces and makes the book approachable for a wide variety of readers. The anecdotes she shares - composites of past clients - are examples of how the abstract research and theories apply to real women, who feel isolated in their ""problems"" that are actually completely normal and near universal. Besides learning about some pretty fundamental sex research (i.e. nonconcordance, fetal genital development, human sexual response), and laughing at some choice, hilarious quips (""Remember the rat with the lemon fetish?""), I was inspired by the passion that drove Nagoski to write the book in the first place. She crystallizes her motivation beautifully in the final chapter: ""I am done living in a world where women are lied to about their bodies; where women are objects of sexual desire but not subjects of sexual pleasure; where sex is used as a weapon against women; and where women believe their bodies are broken, simply because those bodies are not male. And I am done living in a world where women are trained from birth to treat their bodies as the enemy."" It's militant, but I can see where she's coming from. Can you imagine her frustration as a therapist (and a professor) seeing client after client and student after student come in privately convinced they had incurable sexual deficiencies, but she knows from talking to all of them and from current research that none of them are sick? Congrats to Nagoski for writing this book and giving herself a megaphone to counteract the cultural and media messages women receive about how sex should work for them. Because, according to the science, sex is the same ingredients, organized by individuals according to their own recipes, and each result is normal. "
179,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23191588-jeremy-randall,Rating 5 out of 5,"A book that has had little bits read out to me by a certain human over the last few months was finally put in front of me to read. I have seen a few ted talks and the like from Emily, and thought a lot about the snippets shared, so it was nice to run through the entire document and take notes and think and mourn and celebrate sexuality and how it is presented and understood by many and the liberating and sometimes simple truths that we are all normal, we are all different and there are reasons for many things that can be changed if we want something different. It felt odd at times reading a book that asked me, the reader, to look at my vulva or remember that time that I felt abnormal because of my mons pubis. But, as a very eye-opening view of the internal machinations of experiences, I have never had, it was a great read. And one that many more humans should read. Sex is a normal and great thing that has been communicated terribly to many of us because of so many reasons, both religious and economical, and Come as you are, beautifully gives one, things to think about, things to try and things to see from a different perspective that you are beautiful, you are normal and you can feel pleasure on your own terms because they are different to the person sitting next to you. You should read this. Or at least watch her ted talk. Big take aways - What are your breaks and accelerators?- Are you responsive or spontaneous (both are normal just one is more common, and its not the one you think)- What contexts do you think will increase engagement?- Your emotions aren't to be run from, they can be named, understood and assisted with, even when they are totally your responsibilty. - You may have you rethink your efforts and goals instead of getting frustrated with them. And if you are normal AND different, your efforts and goals probably should be different from the person next to you, or the person in that instagram story. Can I get an amen? :D "

181,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4220727-l-va,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is an important book. Although I already knew some stuff (or intuitively knew it), it was great to see everything explained in words, since I like understanding the human experience (not just cluelessly living). Despite what the subtitle might suggest, it's not some women's-magazine-style sex advice book, but a thorough and science-based exploration of female sexuality. And this is extremely important, because in our male-dominated culture, female sexuality and pleasure unfortunately are of secondary importance. Actually this book made me feel quite sad - given that sexuality plays such a huge role in our lives, it's still buried under shame, guilt and other learned views. And to think of all the countless women who will never truly enjoy their bodies just because they don't have the access to this information - that's really painful to understand. So read it and allow yourself to enjoy every aspect of human life.I wrote [this book] because I am done living in a world where women are lied to about their bodies; where women are objects of sexual desire but not subjects of sexual pleasure; where sex is used as a weapon against women; and where women believe their bodies are broken, simply because those bodies are not male. And I am done living in a world where women are trained from birth to treat their bodies as the enemy."
182,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5649720-rebecca,Rating 4 out of 5,"After both Dan Savage and Slate gave a hat tip to this new book, I was intrigued. Now I'm enthusiastic. Nagoski is a female, sex-positive researcher who's decided it's her mission to make sure that the world understands that women's sex drives are not just a broken version on men's. She's also the kind of writer who will hold your hand, tell you you're ok, and then talk about All the Feels (in literally those words).She's flip without being flippant, funny without being insincere. And the information is genuinely interesting, even if you're relatively happy with your sex life. If you're not, and at least one woman is involved in your sex life, this could be eye opening. She does a great job of connecting dots that I think I always saw without seeing the patterns. It's not that there's anything so foreign to my experience; it's more like a new way of looking at the facts. Why context matters so much. How expectation and arousal are linked but not the same thing. How hormones have less to do with reactions than stress. How sex is not actually a drive.Life altering? Not sure yet. But eye-opening."
183,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14851478-joshua,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is one of the most important books I've ever read. I have always suspected (which is probably putting it far too lightly) that the messages we receive from media, culture, family, etc. about what is normal in sexuality are well off the mark. This book uses really good science to uncover all those messages for what they are. Insidious lies. I feel like I finally, after 30+ years of struggle have a path forward to accepting and understanding my own sexuality. Reading this was also a revelation to me about my partner's unique and wonderful sexuality, and I now feel like I finally have a path forward to accepting, understanding, and even nurturing her sexuality. Wow! Just wow. I rarely universally recommend a book, but in this case I must insist that if you are a human being with genitals and a brain you will benefit immensely from this book. It is the book about sex that I have been waiting for my whole life."
184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4077992-ryan-greer,Rating 4 out of 5,"Wow, what an incredible book.Obviously I'm not the intended audience on this one, but I firmly believe that anyone interested in learning more about their own sexuality or, perhaps more importantly, the cultural perceptions and assumptions around women's sexuality that pervades every facet of all of our lives, should read this book.Despite the clickbait title this book is about so much more than just sex, it's about self-worth and empowerment and body image and trauma and creating safe spaces to heal and to grow. And that is worth reading. Nagoski writes with great wit and charm and candor, yet backs up her work with excellent research.Seriously, even if you have to read it in the closet because you're embarrassed to let anyone know you're reading it, you should still check it out. More people need to understand the mixed messages we tell ourselves and our sisters and our daughters. The world needs more allies."
185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24060279-sallanvaara,Rating 5 out of 5,"A solid 4,5 stars! I really really enjoyed this book. It was useful and reassuring in many even somewhat unexpected ways and I think this book will help me - and most women who read it - a lot in my life overall! Based on the reviews, many people have found the style annoying, but I didn't mind at all. It was the right balance of casual and scientific (and serious and funny) and while the metaphors were indeed abundant, I thought they were consistent and made otherwise kinda abstract scientific concepts more tangible, which is kind of the point of metaphors. I guess it's a bit hard to tell whether this book is science with a side of self-help or vice versa, and the latter chapters were a bit heavy on the mindfulness stuff which I continue to have complicated feelings about, but all in all I thought this book was so necessary and so great! Hard to be mad at a self-help book when it very clearly helped me, so... Recommended!"
186,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,Rating 5 out of 5,"Esther Perel together with Emily Nagoski are able to save the world. If only people were brave enough to let them. Shame lives in a cul-de-sac, and mental health is the basis of all health. I've read these two books simultaneously and they are doing wonders in my life since I am changing myself and visibly changing my surroundings. Both of these books are connected with sex therapy but the basis of all is good old (psycho) therapy. Be the change you wish to see in the world by going deep within. Be even the smallest change for better and with time you will see this reflective, mirroring the smallest change in the outside world – it is how our brain is wired. And this is how all changes start. With the right book, right time, peaceful state of mind and a lot of readiness to become what you like about yourself."
187,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1373260-jaclyn-day,Rating 4 out of 5,"This well-reviewed book is fascinating and empowering and important. It’s really a massive information dump, but told so frankly and accessibly, and with an unrelenting body-positive message. Raising a young daughter, I’m thankful for books like this–books that are such a stark and welcome departure from the kind of sex education that my generation typically received. It’s entirely factual, not relying on the kind of sensational (and subtly shaming) messages that you might see in women’s magazines. I also appreciated Nagoski addressing many incorrect cultural norms, typical false “scripts” women have about themselves and their sexuality, and how childhood experiences or trauma can have a resounding, lifelong effect. She provides realistic solutions too, rooted in proactive learning and healing. "
188,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10578700-kelley,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was absolutely captivated by Emily Nagoski when I heard her on Glennon Doyle's podcast a few months ago. She's so passionate and energized about debunking all the myths that are out there about sex and helping people overcome their issues with it. I immediately found the audiobook on the library app and listened to it. This book was extremely empowering. After a while, the book got a little bit rambly with self-help affirmations and many many metaphors. Don't get me wrong, I'm an English teacher and I stan a good metaphor. I think her editor could've helped her trim this book a bit better, as the core ideas and information are essential to sexual health. I recommend listening to her interview on the We Can Do Hard Things podcast."
189,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45822116-matej,Rating 4 out of 5,"Informative, entertaining, easy to read. Important concepts such as the dual control model, arousal nonconcordance, responsive desire are well explained, and illustrated with fitting semi-fictional stories.The book is a slightly weird mixture between science and therapy. The boundary between hard science and feel-good messages may not be always entirely clear, and some research that does not help the therapeutic message is deliberately omitted (as the book explicitly acknowledges). There is also a fair bit of repetition in the book, presumably for the benefit of folks not using spaced repetition."

I had a little difficulty getting around this book with it being an ebook. I don’t ordinarily read and write reviews about books like these only to have to go and post a REVIEW on my blog, in public, where EVERYONE knows me, too! Talk about embarrassing!!! Oh, Me OH MY, so here goes!!! Writing about books about sex can be and is extremely personal, but I urge you to share this extremely informative book with your friends and others, men, too! This book is NOT ONLY meant for women. If a man really wants to learn everything there is about women at all stages of their sexual life, this is THE book to teach them. Ladies, there is so much information in this book for US! We may think we know it all as we have our own body and have already experienced a lot, but this book has even more you would never or could never even guess about. I believe I may have received this book from a comment I may have left somewhere, and a publicist from Simon and Schuster has been kind enough to share this book with me! I thank them SO, SO, SO MUCH, to whoever you are! I have learned SO MUCH from this book, it’s kind of crazy! You would think a woman my age and done with menopause would already know ALL of this! I am being honest and telling everyone I did not! Now I have a whole NEW can of worms that opened up with menopause, as the saying goes! This book has helped tremendously with that, too! Again, this IS how thankful I am I 'did' get to read this book! I tossed around writing a review about this book back and forth because of the feeling of embarrassment, but don't let that stop you from reading this OR from sharing it with your girlfriends, too. That is what pushed me on to write this review, to show you it's okay to talk about this and share the information from it. It truly would be a shame to miss out on ANY information in this book. If this book can help ONE person out there like it has helped me and so many others, then HERE IS EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO GET YOUR SEX LIFE AND MORE INTO THE SHAPE IT SHOULD BE IN! LIFE IS SHORT - ENJOY IT!!! THAT’S MY MOTTO!!! This author wrote an ENTIRE BOOK, and she does NOT think this is embarrassing, and you know what? It is NOT! It is REAL! It is true, it is HONEST, it covers a NORMAL HUMAN BODILY FUNCTION that just happens to feel really, really GREAT! With the teaching in this book, that feeling of GREAT goes to WONDERFUL, EXTREMELY, I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT WHAT I LEARNED NOW!!! Another thing to keep in mind is in the future, this book may become helpful again. As we age, sex changes, and our bodies change. Sex is always changing, your body is always changing, and sex changes again! Over and over and over. It repeats, and sometimes NEW problems POP UP! The author covers EVERYTHING I think there is to be known about sex and more. I think every woman should read this book because of the information it has in it. So I found ""the"" book FOR WOMEN! THIS, IS IT! Then . . . NOT ONLY FOR WOMEN! MEN, YOU GET OUT THERE, TOO, AND GET YOUR HANDS ON THIS BOOK TO LEARN MORE ABOUT US, ""WOMEN""! WE deserve to receive what this book has to offer us and you, what YOU deserve to LEARN to apply to us what you have learned from it! Men, those days of getting only what YOU want, then rolling over and going to sleep, snoring as LOUD as can be, FORGET ABOUT IT! Life is changing as you know it . . . RIGHT NOW!I have to admit I HAVE done searches online looking around for a pill for women like me to have to be able to use just like the men do! I found NOTHING! WHY ARE THESE ONLY FOR MEN? I MUST say it again, “where IS the pill for women?” We should be able to have one of the pills, too, because menopause does a number on us! I found myself asking why is the PILL for MEN an exclusive ONLY for men? Being a woman past menopause, or postmenopausal as the physicians like to cram down our throats, like it or not, sometimes we women need a little extra, ‘Ooomph’! to get going, or I'll be honest and say that we need something MORE to GET us going when that has NEVER been an issue in the past. Our hormones have GREATLY changed, and to be frank, WE need a little help like the men do, too! In ALL my research for women, I've found absolutely NOTHING for women! NOTHING! Why? Although, why was I shocked? It seems as if ALL medical medication, testing and more is ALWAYS based upon MEN! Surprise, surprise I couldn’t find a THING about a pill or help for women! Instead, I found this book! A “book”, you say? Oh, boy! Thanks! No! Really! This book DOES HELP, IT DOES WORK!!! I promise! Read it! There is so MUCH “SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN” information in this book all about sex and regarding so MANY issues as we go through (as we age) and about so many different stages in our lives, as well as problems/situations we may come across, too. I feel this book is SO helpful for women even if you don’t think you have ANYTHING WRONG, it would STILL be a SHAME to miss out and not SHARE this book with all of you because it can only “HELP” us WOMEN in GREAT ways! Who knows? Maybe one day you WILL have one of these issues. You’ll be MORE than prepared for it with this book on hand! Or, if not, then you have this book at your fingertips to be able to read about it! As a last resort, if you purchase this as an ebook, NO ONE will know what you are reading about, either! LOL! Read away! Men, too! Sex is meant to be beautiful and to fill our lives with intimacy. We are sexual creatures. When there are problems, and they DO always happen, if you have read this book, or still have it and refer back to it, (that's the best part, referring back to it!) this book can only help you. So many times sexual issues are happening because of health issues we have no control over, or need to get control over. For instance, for men, if they don't work, then something is seriously wrong and they need to get in to see a doctor immediately! That's the truth. You don't just keep putting off sex until it's a year or longer since the last time. When things like that happen, it only starts to produce anger. Anger and sex don't go together, not even make-up sex. It's not worth it. The reason to have this book is EVERYTHING in this book applies to ALL of us women especially during many different times throughout our lives. I cannot sit on this information and keep it a secret all to myself and NOT write a review! So, here you go, and may the communication between you and your partner about your sex life “together” get better and better because that is where it starts, with communication. Without it, you may as well forget everything. Communication is VITAL in life with everyone you come into contact with, but MOST especially, our partners, especially when it comes to intimacy. Remember, without communication, our spouses cannot read our minds, NOR can we expect them too when it gets right down to it.Buy this book! You never know if you will need it in now or in the future. READ IT NOW, TOO! Having this book on hand puts you that much closer to having ALL your answers to ANY question at hand! You never know what you’ll learn, too, no matter what age you are! I truly mean that, too.I received this book for FREE from the publisher, Simon and Schuster, in exchange to read and write a review about this book.

216,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21543140-mlie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Een tijdje geleden las ik Damn, Honey, een laagdrempelig boek over seksualiteit en feminisme. Ik merkte toen dat ik er best wel meer over zou willen lezen, misschien ook wat uitgebreider, serieuzer en meer wetenschappelijk onderbouwd. Na een korte zoektocht (en het is best ingewikkeld om 'serieuze' boeken rond dit onderwerp te vinden, merkte ik. Ik zocht vast verkeerd) kwam ik bij dit boek uit.Een review in + en -:+ Ik heb echt vooral plussen voor dit boek. Het is eigenlijk een groot basisboek rond vrouwelijke seksualiteit en bevat alles wat je bij seksuele voorlichting écht zou moeten leren (in plaats van de condoom om de bezemsteel). Het gaat over de fysieke kant van seksualiteit, maar ook heel veel (nog meer) over de psychologische kant, eventuele problemen/remmen die er kunnen zijn en hoe je die weg kunt nemen.+ De auteur gebruikt voorbeeldverhalen om dingen uit te leggen en zorgt ervoor dat je dingen onthoudt door makkelijke metaforen te gebruiken.+ De auteur is wetenschapper/seksuoloog en al haar inzichten zijn gebaseerd op wetenschappelijke onderzoeken.+ Ze haalt met het boek belangrijke taboes en vooroordelen weg in de maatschappij. Bijvoorbeeld dat het 'nat worden' van de vrouw, maar tien procent te maken heeft met 'lust' en ook regelmatig willekeurig is (Dit is trouwens ook voor een groot gedeelte zo bij erecties bij mannen, 50%). Waarmee ze bijvoorbeeld bestrijdt dat er soms gezegd wordt dat een vrouw een verkrachting wel lekker moet hebben gevonden, omdat haar lichaam er op reageerde. Echt shocking op wat voor plekken dit nog steeds wordt gezegd!+ Ook maakt ze duidelijk dat iedereen anders seksueel is afgesteld en dat er geen goed of fout is. Zelf-acceptatie is heel belangrijk in het boek en de titel 'Kom als jezelf' past er dan ook goed bij.-: -: De auteur herhaalt veel in haar schrijven. Daardoor wordt de samenhang van het boek goed duidelijk en onthoud je de concepten die ze uitlegt beter, maar het was voor mij soms echt teveel. Het werd wat langdradig af en toe. Heb daardoor echt even een lange leesstop ingelast in het midden, en helemaal op het einde had ik weer moeite om door te lezen. Soms even doorzetten dit boek dus.Conclusie: blij dat ik het gelezen heb. Goed en belangrijk boek, dat misschien iets korter en bondiger had gekund. Vier sterren. Toegevoegd aan de alternatieve leeslijst trouwens :) hij is denk ik wat lang voor middelbare scholieren om helemaal te lezen, maar... is wel een goede naslagbron voor biologiedocenten voor écht relevante seksuele voorlichting."
217,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100183115-erin-slezak,Rating 5 out of 5,"Was this book perfectly written? No. Was it full of sometimes difficult to follow and forced metaphors? Yes. Did I stumble on multiple typos throughout? Yes. Did I, at times, feel a little talked down to for being congratulated for reading about science in a book that advertises science? Yes. But, did I feel that the point of this book, the very core of it, was to help women feel safer, braver, and more compassionate and understanding of themselves? Absolutely. And I think that’s the most important take away from this book. I would say it’s a mostly successful go at science communication and Nagoski definitely worked hard to make this book readable to as many women as possible. Sometimes this was difficult for me because of the constantly changing formats, but there was a real effort made to keep the book flowing and try and grab readers, she even offers TLDRs at the end of each chapter in the hopes that she can get even a few sentences of her message out to even the most unwilling of readerships.I think there are a few times Nagoski stumbled throughout her book and I think some of the repetition really started to grind on me throughout, but there were also many things that she wrote about that made me stop and reflect. There were even things she addressed that I had heard about and researched before reading this that made me see things in a different way. I loved a lot of the psychology writing and I felt especially called out in some spots, especially towards the end where Nagoski reveals that a great way to improve your sex life is to be kind, gentle, and patient with yourself. To throw away the idea of “shoulds” and probably the most shocking to me: you don’t have to feel good or bad about the things that you’re thinking/feeling, in fact, the best place is to be is NEUTRAL. NEUTRAL!!! That blew me away hahaI think CAYA is a great beginners course to understanding female sexuality, I hope more research continues to come out and help us understand ourselves a bit better. Also, I think this is a great book to read while you’re in therapy because I have a whole list of things from this book that I can’t wait to discuss with my therapist. CAYA is a great tool for self reflection and I would have to wholeheartedly encourage my friends (man, woman, enby, etc.) to read it to understand more about sex, about society’s view on sex, and the way it’s shaped your own view on sex."

It is by far the best book on the subject I've ever read. I don't know if I've ever felt more seen, more normal, or gained more perspective on things I didn't know, didn't understand, or wasn't taught from a book, but Nagoski's compilation of research and stories from actual women really did the trick. This may be TMI - but a few things I gleaned from this tome: I learned that I have almost exclusively reactive sexual response (as opposed to spontaneous) and THAT'S OKAY. I learned how female genitalia relates to our male counterparts (quite differently than I once thought). That ""sex drive"" really isn't a thing persay. I just have average brakes and a stubborn accelerator. I said ""huh!"" and ""wow!"" out loud several times during the course of reading...and brought up several of the points with the hubs - who has since picked up the book and is more than halfway through it. It's not necessarily an EASY read, but it is also not overly scientific at all - and has plenty of anecdotes and real life examples. (She's created 8 semi-fictional characters who all share traits of ACTUAL people she's spoken to), which makes it easier to follow along. If you've experienced any sexual trauma, this is STILL a good read - Nagoski is gentle and will tell you to skip parts if you aren't comfortable or aren't there in your healing journey yet. If you've ever wondered if you were ""broken"" or wished your enjoyed sex more or had a higher drive or...gosh...really...if you're a female and want your mind to be blown and things you thought you knew turned on your head, read this. You'll thank me. I think I've thanked my buddy Beth for recommending it like umpteen times now. It's a game changer, for sure. I've gotta give Beths' copy back at some point but this is one that needs to be on my shelf so I can lend it to everyone I know. "
219,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46762737-marz,Rating 4 out of 5,"before I get into this review, I want to preface that, like the author states herself in the beginning of this book, its contents are almost entirely centred around cisgender women. as someone who is cisgender myself, any of my succeeding thoughts below were and are shaped by this part of my identity. Gender and sexuality are not a binary “female/male” concept by any means, however, I will be generalising in that way below for the purposes of reviewing the book, especially since I am not qualified to speak for the experiences of trans or genderfluid identities. now, onto my review:coming to terms with my place in the world as a woman is a journey that is taking (and will continue to take) many of my years. as I enter my twenties, have new life experiences and feel myself developing as a person, a major part of my identity always feels rooted in womanhood. the way I perceive the world, the people around me and the way I am perceived back in turn is immeasurably shaped by it, and it’s something I personally feel very conscious of almost all the time.a large part of this journey has involved overcoming shame and/or embarrassment about entirely normal female experiences, or experiences that are culturally considered ‘normal’ for men but shameful for women (i.e. the subject of this book). obviously, reading one book isn’t going to undo two decades worth of internalising less-than-true narratives surrounding female sexuality in my mind - however, it‘s a positive start for me, and I hope that it can be a positive start (or continuation) for anyone else who does pick this up. anyway, with that preamble out of the way, here are my actual thoughts on what I’ve read.the book centres around redefining the cultural myths we have grown up with (and unconsciously consume) about sex and female sexuality, and dives heavily into how there is no one-size-fits-all standard for the way we should perceive sexuality. it also presents practical suggestions and solutions to unlearning these thought patterns, and is overall very easy to read and follow, despite sometimes consisting of scientific discussions and terminology. the parts of this book that I thought worked best were the ones which discussed cultural beliefs, and scientifically broke down the history and level of truth behind them. some of these included: - an informative spotlight on female (and male) anatomy. goes into biological origins, and social perceptions of this anatomy, and the impact that both of these have had. I can almost guarantee that you will learn something you didn’t know if you read this section - its crazy how much more you can learn outside of a year 10 classroom filled with teenagers who take nothing seriously.. - the concept of accelerators and brakes, and how emotions and one’s general context play the largest role in regulating these. it’s difficult to explain in a review, so I’ll just say this is singlehandedly the most valuable concept I learnt from this book. it’s a much more complex idea than the default image that comes to mind of turn ons/offs, and I think it’s super important to be aware of. - the discussion of the “men as default” approach governing our cultural understanding of sexuality, and the impacts of this on women. even though I consider myself as “self aware” as I could be about this concept already, I was surprised by how much I subconsciously didn’t even consider up until it was brought up in the book. again, something I thought was valuable to learn about.the ‘flaws’ (or put less bluntly, things I didn’t enjoy as much) about this book are for the most part minor, but still worth mentioning: - a bit idealistic. some of the lived experiences adapted into stories (for the sake of demonstrating the practicality of concepts) seemed quite black and white. like, it’s great that these people were able to overcome their problems in different ways, but I feel like the book could’ve done a better job of prefacing that change and unlearning is a gradual process. it just sets this expectation that your life is changed once you read this book, which I think is an overstatement in some ways - your mindset may be changed, but implementing these changes into your daily life will almost definitely be another challenge to overcome. - at one point, it felt like it undermining sexual assault for the sake of a story about men’s emotional responses. could have used any other, less invasive and traumatic example, to achieve the same point without seeming invalidating. minor issue but it was still something that bothered me a bit. - could have been less focused on cisgender, monogamous women. I don’t wish that the author attempted to speak on behalf of any group she is not a part of by any means - I just think that had that discussion been made there (by somebody qualified to discuss it), it would’ve made it a more well-rounded read. on this note, there was a lesbian couple discussed, but it almost felt flat since there was little mention of how that aspect of their lives was influenced by cultural perceptions of sexuality especially for non-straight women.overall though, I am very glad that I picked this book up. it’s rare to read something that challenges your understanding of something you thought you knew a lot about already, and this definitely did that for me. I really appreciate the author’s blend of science and popular culture in her discussions, and I value a lot of things I learnt from reading - I made so many annotations to come back to :’). to anyone interested, and to anyone with a partner who identifies as female, I would recommend this book.- 4.25/5 stars"
220,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16064660-nina,Rating 5 out of 5,"The sort of byline here (""The Surprising New Science..."") was a little bit of a turn off for me that almost had me skip this book but I'm glad I didn't! Here, Emily Nagoski is your kind, compassionate scientist friend who cares about your sexual health and, more significantly, your happiness. Using language that is clear but not too technical and metaphors which are actually super helpful, she explains the psychology behind a person's sexual accelerator and brakes systems, some of the history behind our understanding of female sexual health and why it's all skewed and traumatic and mostly non-intuitive (answer: the patriarchy), and gives really helpful reframing about how to move forward to better, more pleasurable experiences. On the latter point, I really appreciate how, while this obviously includes methods for partnered experiences, she starts off where it should always start: as a solo encounter between you and your own body. Part pop science, part pop psychology, part your older sister's sexually liberal best friend making sure you know what's what about bodies, this was a fun read that probably only took me so long because of my short attention span, and I would recommend it to honestly anyone of any gender because it's really interesting. An additional note: Initially, I was nervous about this read because of the very gendered angle to it - genitals are not the same thing as gender and everything about this book's jacket is PINK - but I actually took a lot of comfort in Emily's regular, inclusive refrain of ""same parts, different places"". She does address the disconnect between gender and genitals in the beginning, and adds appropriate disclaimers to her blanket use of what is certainly very traditionally gendered language. "
221,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84810602-lostindreams13,Rating 5 out of 5,"If I ever meet a man who has voluntarily read this book, I will probably marry him. Emily wrote an amazing book about the science of sex. You might expect another popular science book, where the subject is explained in an understandable and, hopefully, fun way. However, this book feels like a friend talking to you. Emily is quite funny, very straightforward, and uses a lot of analogies, of which you wonder how they make sense. Nevertheless, once she makes the point, it is so logical and also makes it much more easy to explain to other people. I also liked the snippets of the stories of some of her clients/friends in between, as they very nicely illustrate specific situations and how the knowledge discussed in the chapters applies to these situations. There may be quite a bit of information in there that you (inherently) already know, but Emily explains why it is like that, and I'm a person who needs to know 'the why'. Furthermore, she repeats a lot and continuously comes back to previous points, which is really important because you start to see the bigger picture, and sometimes you just need to hear things a few hundred times before you start to believe them. I really wish I had read this book years ago."
222,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7741393-cassidy,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is for anyone who has a vulva or who has any hope of intimacy with someone who has a vulva. 😂Seriously, maybe I was just raised in a sexually repressed culture, but this book was absolutely eye opening. First, yes, it’s about sex. The title and about 1/3 of the chapters make that very clear, BUT it’s also about understanding the female body, it’s about the cultural discrediting of female voices in regard to our own bodies, and it’s about the lack of knowledge that most people have about what’s going on in a female body and brain. (Seriously, the lack of scientific understanding and awareness of like, over half the population’s body functioning is appalling…but patriarchy.)I think the thing I loved the most about this book is that while it’s a book about sex, It’s also about ALL the misinformed cultural and media focused messaging around being female from sexuality to body image to stress cycles to brain functioning to leading fulfilling relationships. So, I repeat: if you have a vulva (and aren’t offended by words like “vulva” and “clitoris” and “orgasm” I suppose-because those words are very prevalent in this book, for good reason 😂) I would HIGHLY recommend this!

So when you notice yourself feeling dissatisfied with your sexuality, when you notice shame or frustration or grief, allow yourself to direct those feelings away from yourself and instead focus the emotions towards the culture that told you the wrong story.”just as I finished the last chapter I leaned over to David and said, “I want to send this to every woman, every person, I know.” There is SO much I wish I could say about the good and needed work of this book. Emily Nagoski is doing some dang good stuff.I took this book in chunks because each chapter was so rich, so prompting of so much reflection, and so PRACTICAL. I ordered a copy just so I could have in my therapy office because, let me tell you, the question “is there something wrong with me?” comes up with almost every client when you get into sex. This book repeats more times than I could count: “you are perfectly normal,” and that’s a message worth repeating 💛"
224,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15249098-donald-powell,Rating 5 out of 5,"A comprehensive review of female sexuality in America. The author, a Phd. in Behavioral health, offers many concrete ideas within a well integrated creed to help women be happier and healthier about their sexuality. She deals with culture, individual history, individual trauma, biology and psychology (especially introspection) and is very persuasive. She does not ""man bash"" at all. Since the book is about women's sexuality she does not discuss it but I suspect she would agree men have sexual issues from our culture too. Like all good ""self help"" books, she espouses time tested principles of patience, tolerance, kindliness and love. She is very positive and reaffirming in every sentence, realistically dealing with many difficult topics. Her theme is based in logic, science, scholarly support, and positivity, making this book stand out in this genre. Everyone would benefit from reading it whether or not you nod in complete agreement."
225,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47651405-ana-dias,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was a really nice surprise as I picked it from the bookstore a bit sckeptical about another ""self help"" book about women sexuality. But it is everything but that. I believe it can be relevant for women and men, regardless of sexual orientation, if in a relationship, if struggling with something or not. You will learn about science, society and history and most importantly that you and everyone else is not broken, ""we are all made of same parts, just organised in different ways"". You might get very upset, like me, about how patriarchy and long standing societal believes really can damage women (and men shall I say) but better to be more and more aware of it and take it one step at time to make things change. Starting with you, and the knowledge and friend-like, non-judgemental advice in this book can surely help with that."
226,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/143495376-jessica,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book honestly took me a long time to finish, for no particular reason other than it was more technical than I anticipated, which is just simply more difficult for me to consume all at once. It was so so interesting and I think I learned so much — it would probably be a worthy re-read later in life or later into a long term monogamous relationship. The only thing that bothered me is the fact that her metaphors, while very helpful, sometimes feel a bit… infantilizing? I think I don’t love when authors directly address the audience, and the way she writes feels like she’s talking to me except sort of not in a good way sometimes. Like when she asks us, “Guess what?” I’m kind of just like, girl I’m not guessing and you know I’m not guessing. Just tell me what. But regardless, so much good information about sex and so many myths about sex debunked. Loved the content."

Regardless of whether what is said here is scientifically accurate or not; this book normalizes our seemingly lonely sufferings/struggles/worries regarding our sexual wellbeing, rendering them solvable. Many reviews go into detail about the content of this book, so I’ll keep it short. Any married couples (especially women who are the main target audience for this book) should and need to read it. The sense of liberation and understanding and acceptance of my own sexual wellbeing after finishing this book is simply indescribable; when a book make you feel this way, you know it’s a very well-crafted book that is written from a place of sympathy and care.My only complaint is that it was very repetitive and the metaphors were very overdone. We’re adults, just get to the point 🥲"

It doesn't get into the nitty gritty details of the science behind the brain and sex but it does provide some insight into women's physiology and the psychology of sexual arousal and pleasure. It is a lot of therapy and self-affirmation. Nagoski informs and reiterates throughout the book that ""we all (men and women) have the same parts, just organized differently"" but that does not make you abnormal. Everyone experiences sex and pleasure differently and we should be open to exploring what works for us. Basically, we should stop believing any preconceived notion about female sexuality (and male sexuality) created by the patriarchy it sucks.3.5 stars"

I took away a couple stars because the author and I don’t share a sexual ethic — I don’t think pornography, for instance, is morally neutral — and these kinds of moral issues came up frequently. Also, some parts of the book seemed condescending or cheesy, and I was confused when she mentioned that we live in a sex-negative culture. I think our culture is sex-obsessed but misogynistic, which feels very different than sex-negative. She also mentions that the Judeo-Christian tradition has a low view of sex and the body. Doctrinally this is not true. At the same time, I unfortunately understand why she thinks that.Some parts were 0 stars, some parts were 5 stars. There is a lot here I’ll keep with me."

As with Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle, the book speaks directly to women and is mostly for women, but there's a lot for (hetero) men to learn here too...about their partners, but also about themselves.This isn't a ""sex book"" per se, so if you're expecting a manual of positions or techniques, you won't find it here. More important than any of that is the exploration of the multidimensional reality that is human sexuality (the author makes clear her caveats about the material and its relevance to transgender people). Who knew things were so complicated? And that everything that ""they"" have been repeating to us our whole lives is pretty much wrong?I learned a lot and enjoyed learning it. Nagoski has a gift for making uncomfortable and complex topics easy to digest and even fun to read about. I recommend this book unreservedly!"

In a lot of ways it wasn’t. The main target demographic, from what I could gather, was married women. That being said, I definitely needed to hear a lot of what she had to say. Homegirl was out here talking about self-compassion, mindfulness techniques, anxiety management, grief management, feelings your Feels, self-care, and meta emotions. And let me just go on a tangent for a sec about meta emotions. That section for me was this ah-ha moment of like “oh, there’s a word for that?” Spoiler: it’s basically how and what you feel about your feelings. As someone who has a lot of feelings about their feelings, this was an eye-opening vocab moment. Made me feel a little less alone, for sure.So I’m giving it 5 stars because I needed the humor, the insight, the occasional tough love, and of course, the sex-related worksheets. If you’re my mom and you see this, no you didn’t."

If it weren't for, the valuable information, I would had just added it to my DNF. I can understand that maybe she's trying to teach scientific terms to a broader audience but there are way too many unnecessary and absurdly long metaphors. I also hate that she was constantly ""in this chapter I'll explain this"" or ""in the following chapters I'll explain that"". Like ma'am, just give me the information, the data, and the conclusion, and stop beating around the bush! Overall, I highly recommend the book, but beware of poor delivery and writing."

I really enjoyed how accessible and easy to read this book is. It’s the true sex ed everyone should have gotten in school. I don’t think anything Emily said in here blew my mind or anything like that, but she writes in such a friendly manner—like I’m just having a chat with her. And I just felt like all her topics were very well researched and well put together. The only critique I have for this book is it’s very focused on straight couples. Which—to be fair—I believe Emily has spoken out a lot about sexual experiences outside of just manxwoman so I don't want to just totally diss her or anything.Idk, as someone who identifies on the Ace spectrum, I was just hoping for more focus on that. I got a lot out of this book but Emily really emphasizes “feeling normal so matter who you are or what you like.” Like the messaging was great. But in a weird way I didn’t feel normal at all because this book never…mentioned me? Idk if that makes sense. Anyway, overall I think this is a perfect, great, educational but easy ready."

This book was recommended to me by a few friends and I've recommended it to some friends as well. Nagoski has truly helped me change my mindset about many things and I am here for it. "
235,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I highly recommend for anyone who has questions, concerns, or curiosity about their own sexuality. I was coming from a very religious background myself, and hadn't learned much about sex beyond the mechanics, and had lots of questions. I did not want, however, to just read a Cosmo style list of positions and porn maneuvers. This book is body and sex positive, educational, and interested mostly in individual pleasure and success rather than adding more to expectations. Give it a try, hopefully it will give you more info about yourself too."
236,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128368210-allison,Rating 5 out of 5,"Everyone needs to read this book. Every single person. It is such a great display of the way that society can affect our lives and penetrate our unconscious functions and how it keeps us from joy. Not only does this book help to explain and normalize women’s sexuality, but it also seeks to teach each of us how to let go of “normalcy”, trust our bodies, and ultimately lead ourselves and others in our lives towards JOY. There should be no shame or guilt in experiencing pleasure. In reading this book, I felt an overwhelming sense of finally seeing what I’ve experience be explained and gaining a better understanding of why I feel the way I feel and how to heal from the wounds that society and myself have created surrounding sexuality. Seriously read this book!Ps when a book mentions the Rhesus Monkeys you know it’s good "
237,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147001478-meg-mccarthy,Rating 4 out of 5,"I think every woman should read this book and others like it (with the note that this book is really only geared towards cis women which the author comments on and addresses at the beginning of the book). It is incredibly accessible and normalizing. Because of its accessibility, however, it can be really simple at times if you’re more familiar with this area/subject and very repetitive. There are also quite a few eye roll moments, but I understand what the author was trying to accomplish and I appreciate her goal and intention. "
238,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/161865635-meg,Rating 2 out of 5,"There were some interesting points and concepts, but I really struggled with the delivery/conversational tone of writing. I went in with an open mind, expecting to absolutely devour but it felt like such a chore to finish. Far too many metaphors (so exhausting!!!), rhetorical questions and call backs. I understand that the intention was to make the science and concepts easily digestible for a wide target audience, but personally found the approach super frivolous and patronising. The science felt overshadowed by metaphors and the writers tone. I just want the facts as is without the silly analogy. I did take away some new insights and learnings, but was a long and hard journey to get to the end. Despite my 2 star rating, I think many people would benefit from reading it. For me it was a case of right message, wrong messenger."

Besides the topics you'd expect in a book like this, Nagoski discusses anatomy (both female and male!), stress and mental health, the influence of media and culture on one's views on sexuality and so much more.Despite the fact that this book is written for women, there is so much in here that applies to men as well, not to mention the fact that the information in this book is good to know for everyone regardless of gender."

242,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5774432-vee,Rating 4 out of 5,"The author gives a caveat at the beginning of this book that it is very cis focused and she is not wrong. It is also quite heteronormative though she does include a few stories following a lesbian couple. As others have mentioned it is also a book that is quite heavy in metaphors. AND it is fantastic. I learned a lot, I stayed engaged, and I would highly recommend this book."

I found a lot of stuff being said, I kind of already knew. I almost wish the book wasn’t PINK , so that more men would read it. I think it should be promoted more towards MEN. The book advocates for consent , trust , & understanding the clues of the body. There also isn’t any science behind the information being said. It kind of written as if I was an appointment with a Sex Therapist. "
244,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10717543-alexa,Rating 5 out of 5,"Really fantastic read that reframed the way I think about and have been taught to think about sex, pleasure, and sexuality. Nagoski is a terrific writer and I love when she references using the word “should.” Believing that you “should like this” or “should do that” suggests you’re wrong or doing something wrong in the first place, which isn’t true. Really thought-provoking read."
245,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31790284-elena-marjineanu,Rating 5 out of 5,"Despite its cheesy title, this was indeed a very, very good book. Coming from a sex-negative culture, I’ve learned a lot of stuff about female sexuality. First: we are all normal. We are made of the same parts just organized in different ways. Second: no two people are alike. Third: we seem to have either sensitive sexual brakes, or sensitive accelerators. Sex-negative culture has trained us to be self-critical and judgmental about our bodies and our sexualities, which is interfering with our sexual wellbeing. If there is only one change you make after reading this book this is to reduce your body self-criticism and relax into pleasure."
246,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126746233-qing-mirabella,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is THE book that every female needs: it tells you one thing that you probably heard, but don’t always believe - you are beautiful, period. But seriously, it really teach you to live with confidence and joy. I enjoy the blend of anatomy, physiology, psychology, studies, stories etc to get her points across. The practice session at the end of each chapter is also highly relevant. Not a book to binge reading, no secret recipes, just read on, practice the kindness, and live with joy."
247,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/125145662-allie,Rating 4 out of 5,"I liked the anecdotes from the characters/people whose stories we followed, the metaphors, and the repeated idea that we all vary and are normal! (Mostly about cis women, but gives that disclaimer at the start & notes that there should be more research that includes trans women and non-binary folks!)"
248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151453102-saskia,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book wasn’t what I expected it to be. I was looking for more of a sociology/ psychology lens and Nagoski takes a more scientific/ biological approach to women’s sexuality. I didn’t find anything groundbreaking in this, or that I leant anything new, but it is all good information. My only major criticism is that there are too many metaphors. Like WAY too many."

But because every woman I’ve ever talked with about sex has had a problem in her sex life at some point in some way shape or form. This was so informative and so positive and so reassuring and made me think of all the women I’ve wished could love themselves as well as they deserved. 10/10. "
250,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113600088-viktoriia,Rating 5 out of 5,"the knowledge in this book is solid gold, and i wish everyone would read it, especially the parts on responsive desire, brakes & accelerators, stress management (!!) and genital non-concordance. however, it could be a bit less repetitive, and i would really appreciate it if the author touched on asexuality too. still 5/5 though."

I also recommend it for people who have or have had stress or trauma-- sexual or otherwise. I feel like anyone could get at least a little something from this wonderful, lovingly crafted book."

Breaks the cultural narrative of what we have been taught about sex and how it “should” be. This book is for women, men, people who don’t have sex, and people who do. With knowledge, there is power. With non-judgement (cue title), there is connection. "

There’s so much to learn and pick up on even if you think you have a decent grasp on shit. Definitely geared towards straight cis-gender women in serious relationships with men although Nagoski does incorporate other relationship structures.

It had some interesting information about non-concordance, reactive desire and brakes/accelerator. It also teaches an important message that every body is normal, empowering women, supported by science. I can see how it would be beneficial to some, helping to change perspectives and dispel dangerous myths, however the repetitive phrases and chatty writing style was not for me. "

274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147156223-erin-schauder,Rating 5 out of 5,"i thought of who i know that could read this review—my boss, my colleagues, my sisters and sisters-in-law, my friends, acquaintances, etc. i was hesitant to even mark that i was reading this book. because real sex and orgasm are such taboo topics, but, like, why?!! our culture sucks for that. anyhoo, i thought, “fuck it,” and i marked my progress and now i’m writing a review. because who cares who saw that i read this book. i’m for certain going to appreciate my body more (or at least try to…or at least be aware of and mindful when i’m not) and have better sex because of this book. so you’re welcome for bringing you awareness to this book, because now you can read it too! and you shouldn’t feel ashamed. because our bodies are beautiful. everything you experience is NORMAL, unless you’re in pain, in which case, you should consult a doctor. but otherwise, NORMAL.this was so educational. heavy into metaphors, but i think those helped me understand the science better.**come AS YOU ARE, just change the context!**not just for people who aren’t having good sex! literally everyone who is a cisgender woman (author explains in the beginning) or who loves a cisgender woman can benefit from this!Favorite/memorable quotes (not for you to read, but for me to remember):on loving your body after having a baby: “…it's okay to feel sad that my body will never be what it used to be. I put a lot of effort into learning to love that body, and now I've got to start all over again learning to love this one…It's okay to feel sad that your body has permanently changed."" pg. 36“A friend of mine let a bad relaionship and declared (on Facobol, 4 choose to hurt no longer. Expartner) can f hut me anymore."" The second somence is 100 percent rue and cause for celebration. But the first sentence doesnt make sense from an attachment/completing the cycle point of vie.When you leave a bad relationship, you have all this pent-up hurt and roge and even fear locked up inside you, which must be allowed to discharge safely.What mokes more sense is, ""I choose to allow the hurt to heal."" Healing always involves pain- if you break your finger, it hurts, gradually less and less until it heals. Same goes for healing emotional injury. You can't choose for your broken heart not to hurt, any more than you can choose for a broken bone not to hurt. But you can recognize the pain as part of the healing, and you can trust your heart to heal, just as you trust your bones to heal, knowing that it will gradually hurt less and less as you recover.” pg. 144“We need to dischargon. ""Home"" is the pl, complete tho eyede, before our bodies can move on. ""Home"" is the place physialand emotional—where we can discharge stress without being judged or shamed or told we just need to relax or forget about it. ""Home"" is where we receive our partner’s loving presence.” People who listen with a loving presence are calm, atrentive, and warm y attuned to the other person.In the very best relationships, we're allowed to experience all forms of stress anger, fear, shutdown—and receive the loving presence of our partner sitting still and quiet through the storm.” pg. 146“At last he looked into her eyes and said,""You really don't see it. You really believe this stuff makes you less beautiful. Honey, your body ges exter every day, just by being the body of the woman I share my life with. Your belly is our belly. I've got one too. Do you love me less for it?"" pg. 154“Your family and your culture plant the seeds and tend the garden, and they teach you how to tend it. They plant the seeds of language and attitudes and knowledge and habits about love and safety and bodies and sex…You may find that your family and your culture have planted some beautiful, nourishing things. You may also find that your family and culture have planted some pretty toxic crap in your garden. And everyone even those whose families planted pretty good stuff will have to deal with the invasive weeds of a sex-negative culture full of body shaming and sex stigma. These travel not in the seeds planted by families but underground via their roots, like poison ivy, under fences and over walls, from garden to garden. No one chose that they be there, but there they are nonetheless.” pg. 155""I just feel a lot more confident in myself, in my body! I know now that I'm amazing to be with and I can revel in that…It's like one day I just decided that it was all bullshit. Who are they to tell me I'm not amazing exactly as I am?"" pg. 167on learning disgust in regards to sex-related things: “So one day, Jessica is masturbating in her room at naptime, when her adult caregiver walks in and sees her with her hand down her pants. The parent recoils in an involuntary disgust response, and says, ""Stop that!"" On that same day, in a different home, Theresa is also masturbating, and her adult caregiver also walks in and sees her with her hand down her pants. But that parent says calmly, ""We're leaving for your aunt's house in a few minutes. Get your shoes on."" Jessica's brain learns to associate the shame and distress (brakes) communicated by her parent with whatever sexual arousal (accelerator) she was feeling at the moment her parent scolded her. Theresa's brain, by contrast, learns no such association. She was interrupted but not shut down—her accelerator deactivated, but withoutnecessarily hitting the brake.” pg. 175“For sex educators, the rule is, ""Don't yuck anybody's yum."" And since we can't know what everybody else's yums are, we don't yuck anything. We know that disgust is a social emotion and that our students have already been exposed to too many people who communicate disgust around sex.” pg. 176“All you ever need to do is begin to recognize where your learned disgust response is interfering with your own sexual pleasure, and decide whether it's something you'd rather let go of. Your genitals and your partners', your genital fluids and your partners', your skin and sweat and the fragrances of your body, these are all healthy and beautiful-not to mention normal elements of human sexual experience. You get to choose whether you feel grossed out by them.” pg. 176“Remind yourself that the day you were born, your body was a cause for celebration, for love without condition, and that's just as true today as it was then. Let these self-critical thoughts go, let the judgments go, and notice only the things you like.” pg. 182“Wouldn't it be amazing to live in a world where performers and artists and media outlets were competing to make the largest number of women feel fantastic about their bodies right now?” pg. 184on genital response vs. arrousal (TW: sexual assault): “If we persist in the false belief that women's genital response reflects what they ""really"" want or like, then we have to conclude that if their genitals respond during sexual assault, it means they ""really"" wanted or liked the assault. Which isn't just nuts, it's dangerous.” pg. 209“The scripts are written into your brain early, by your family and culture remember the Moral Message, the Medical Message, and the Media Message from Chapter 5?But scripts aren't about what we intellectually believe is true. They act as a template for our emotional One Ring and for our little monitor to filter and organize information. You can disagree with a script and still find yourself behaving according to it and interpreting your experience in terms of it.” pg. 300“Emotion coaching teaches you that* ﻿﻿You can recognize lower-intensity emotions so that you can manage them before they escalate.* ﻿﻿Negative emotions are a natural response to negative life events. Because negative life events are sometimes inevitable, so are negative emotions.* ﻿﻿Because negative emotions are a normal part of life, they are dis-cussed, given names, and empathized with.* ﻿﻿""It's normal that sometimes it feels hard,"" ""When you feel bad, we love you just as much as when you feel good,"" and ""You cry all you need to, honey.""* ﻿﻿Your sadness, anger, and fear are signs of being human.” pg. 311“Lots of families use both styles, depending on the context or the specific emotion. And bear in mind that emotion dismissing is often lovingly intended. ""Don't cry, honey,"" seems like a thoroughly benevolent sentiment, motivated by a desire to help someone who is suffering to feel better. But underneath ""Don't cry, honey,"" is a subtle hint that the feelings are unwelcome. That you're making other people uncomfortable. That it would be easier for everyone if you just didn't feel that, so please stop.But uncomfortable feelings happen. They are the normal, healthy response to negative life events. When you experience an injustice, anger happens. When you experience a loss, sadness happens. When you experience obstacles in your progress toward a goal, frustration happens.When you experience a threat, fear happens. And even if you only anticipate any of these things, you may very well experience the emotion, and it will be just as uncomfortable as if the thing were actually happening. Things that happen also end. Every single time, as long as you don't slam on the brakes to stop yourself from going through the tunnel.” pg. 312“Some people find it helpful to think about allowing feelings in the same way they allow themselves to pee and poop. It's built into the system. You don't tell yourself you shouldn't have to pee, you just wait for an appropriate time and place. And if your need to pee is urgent, you seek out an appropriate context. Same goes for feelings. They're a natural part of being human, built into our biology. Cultural rules mean we can't just feel our feeling anywhere we want, but we can find an appropriate time and place.” pg. 313“The day you were born, the world had a choice about what to teach you about your body. It could have taught you to live with confidence and joy inside your body. It could have taught you that your body and your sexuality are beautiful gifts. But instead, the world taught you to feel critical of and dissatisfied with your sexuality and your body. You were taught to value and expect something from your sexuality that does not match what your sexuality actually is. You were told a story about what would happen in your sexual life, and that story was false. You were lied to. I am pissed, on your behalf, at the world for that lie. And I'm working to create a world that doesn't lie to women about their bodies anymore. I can't change the injury that the world inflicted on you, and neither can you. What you can do is heal.” pg. 327“…she became much gentler with herself when she noticed herself being self-critical about her body or feeling guilty about pleasure. She didn’t say to herself, ""Stop it!"" She just thought, ""Yup. There are the self-critical thoughts again."" She practiced nonjudgment.” pg. 329“…it's not about just wanting sex, it's about creating a context really, it's about creating a life— that makes space for both people's needs.” pg. 329“I wrote it because I am done living in a world where women are lied to about their bodies; where women are objects of sexual desire but not subjects of sexual pleasure; where sex is used as a weapon against women; and where women believe their bodies are broken, simply because those bodies are not male. And I am done living in a world where women are trained from birth to treat their bodies as the enemy. I wrote this book to teach women to live with confidence and joy.” pg. 332"

Il y a quelque chose de très « thérapie par les pairs » dans l’approche, et ça m’a rapidement lassée. Cela dit, c’est une question de préférence personnelle et ça n’enlève rien au fait que ce livre constitue une ressource précieuse auprès d’un (très) grand nombre de personnes. Au final, Nagoski nous offre une lecture accessible et validante que j’aurais tendance à recommander malgré tout. Pour ce que ça vaut, j’ai préféré son podcast du même nom, que j’ai dévoré en un après-midi.

(Chapter 7 really hit home.) Good news! We are both normal and things are fixable. If you are looking for a step-by-step how-to, this is not it. This is more about mindset and communication.Highly recommend. It is inclusive of same-sex relationships, but is definitely geared towards the clitoral-having half of the population."

Bij deze wil ik IEDEREEN die zich identificeert als vrouw aanraden dit boek te lezen. Nee, ik bedoel, ik smeek het je om dit te lezen. Wat een prachtig, leuk, informatief boek over vrouwelijke seksualiteit en alles wat daarbij komt kijken. Dit zijn een paar dingen die je gaat leren:- The Dual Control Model: SIS (sexual inhibition system, 'the brakes') en SES (sexual enhancement system, 'the accelerators')- non concordance: wat is het? is het normaal? (spoiler: ja)- een heel interessante kijk op sex in relation to stress, maar ook tips over stress die je over het algemeen kunnen helpen (complete the stress cycle!!!)- hoe de media & moderne cultuur jou verkeerde dingen over seksualiteit hebben wijsgemaakt, en dat dit tot op vandaag de dag nog invloed heeft op hoe jij seks ervaart. Maar!!! dit kan je veranderen!!!- het verschil tussen 'desire' en 'arousal': het zit m in de drie fases van opgewonden raken: expecting; enjoying; eagerness.- 'sex drive' bestaat niet!!! zieke bullshit - sex is an incentive motivation system- het belang van een goeie, sex positive context. En tips how to 'turn on the ons, & turn off the offs' - orgasmes! Al de informatie over orgasmes, verschillende soorten, hoe het werkt, waarom werkt het zo, etc. etc. etc. Fantastisch uitgelegd dmv het metafoor van a flock of birds- andere prachtige metaforen: je seksualiteit is een soort tuintje.- tips, heel veel tips! worksheets, hoe zitten jouw SIS en SES in elkaar, wat valt er onder jouw accelerators en brakes- heel leuke en relevante anekdotes van Emily Nagoski's werk als sex educator- self-criticism, (over wat dan ook), hoe we het doen en hoe we dat kunnen aanpakkenen zo kan ik nog wel even doorgaan. Oh wat hoop ik dat meer mensen dit gaan lezen. En ik hoop ook dat je het boek koopt en er aantekeningen in maakt met potlood of dingen markeert die je interessant vind of belangrijk zijn. Hier zijn wat voorbeelden:""whether a particular stimulus is experienced as sexually appealing depends on the context in which we perceive it""""trust your body. Listen to it - not to the specific circumstances of the moment but to the deep, primal messages of your evolutionary heritage: I am at risk / I am safe.I am broken / I am whole.I am lost / I am home.""""You can't choose for your broken heart not to hurt, any more than you can choose for a broken bone not to hurt. But you can recognize the pain as part of the healing, and you can trust your heart to heal, just as you trust your bones to heal, knowing that it will gradually hurt less and less as you recover.""""sex-negative culture has trained us to be self-critical and judgmental about our bodies and our sexualitites, and it's interfering with our sexual wellbeing""!!!""Your best source of knowledge about your sexuality is your own internal experience""!!!  ""Knowing how your sexuality works is important; welcoming your sexuality as it is, without judgment or shame, is more important. And that's the hard part for a lot of women. [...] So the hard part isn't knowing that you're responsive or nonconcordant or whatever else is true right now about your sexuality. The hard part is liking your sexuality as it is, when for multiple decades the world has been trying to convince you you're broken."" !!!Jeetje ik kan dit hele boek wel quoten. Maar hier nog even één laatste quote, basically wat ik van dit boek heb geleerd, gebaseerd op wat de schrijfster had geleerd tijdens haar opleiding als sex educator en carriere als sex researcher:"".. I gained a vast store of knowledge, but more importantly I gained a radically more healthful attitude: that a woman's body and her pleasure belong to her and no one else; that it's possible to say no to intercourse without saying no to all the other things that come with it - the love and the affection and the pleasure and the play; and that my own internal experience was a legitimate guide for whether or not I wanted to try something""Het is een flink boek, met flink wat hoofdstukken, en er komt flink wat science in voor, maar het leuke is dat het je van begin tot einde grijpt, omdat Emily Nagoski de moeilijke science-y stuff in op een leuke Jip en Janneke manier kan vertellen waardoor het allemaal prima te begrijpen is. Haar taalgebruik is heel leuk en gezellig, en het lijkt daardoor alsof de schrijfster je grote zus of je vriendin is die je gewoon heel nuttige informatie geeft. Echt alleen maar liefde en lof voor deze mevrouw.Mensen please lees dit, you will not regret <3 "

290,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110707695-jessica-pin,Rating 2 out of 5,"Come As You Are does a great job teaching women how to undo cultural conditioning about sex and how to feel secure in their bodies. I think that must be why people love it.However, there is a ton of misinformation in this book. 1. The anatomy of the clitoris is described and illustrated incorrectly. The clitoral body is shown truncated and neither labeled nor described. She was not receptive to correction. 2. Sex differences in arousal concordance are implied to be some biological reality. The reality is they are a function of beliefs about sex. The sex difference has been shown to disappear when women don’t believe in sexual double standards. 3. She says the clitoris is vestigial and that it serves no function beyond pleasure. This is false. Sexual selection acts on the clitoris separately from the penis. Clitoral stimulation facilitates penetration by increasing lubrication, has been shown to induce physiological changes that make conception more likely, and is the most reliable route to orgasm in 96% of women. Orgasm meanwhile drastically amplifies the amount of oxytocin released during sexual encounters. Oxytocin, often called “the love hormone, has been shown to increase sperm transport and to facilitate pair bonding. Orgasm rate has been shown to correlate with relationship satisfaction. And orgasm and sexual pleasure in general furthermore create desire to have sex in the first place. Without the clitoris, there would be much less bonding, much less female desire for sex, and a lower chance of conception with each encounter. To say none of this is functional or evolutionarily relevant is idiotic. 4. She says the male homologue of the inner labia is the inner foreskin. This is false. The foreskin is homologous to the free end of the clitoral hood. The labia minora are homologous to ventral shaft skin. 5. After multiple pages explaining how women are harder to turn on and easier to turn off, she says “it’s nothing like that.” This is one of many examples where she scraps basic logic presumably to make people feel good. 6. She says, “whether it’s challenges with arousal, desire, orgasm, pain, no sexual sensations—is the result of your sexual response mechanism functioning appropriately . . . in an inappropriate world. You are normal; it is the world around you that’s broken.” This is an extremely damaging sentiment, as many women do suffer from real physical causes of sexual dysfunction — they are actually broken and need repairs or treatment. But they get gaslighted and told it’s all in their heads, that they are “normal.”7. She says Viagra can’t be used to treat female sexual dysfunction because of higher arousal nonconcordance. This is not true. If a woman suffers from inadequate engorgement, Viagra does help. The reason it has not been shown to help women as often as men is because of how female sexual dysfunctions are diagnosed in a way that does not separate out specific physiologic symptoms. Compare “female arousal dysfunction” with “erectile dysfunction.” The FSFI is the gold standard for diagnosis. It was developed by a male psychologist and doesn’t even mention “clitoris” or “vulva.” Arousal disorders are primarily diagnosed based on lubrication problems. Lubrication and engorgement are separate issues so a medication for an engorgement problem won’t help a lubrication problem. Viagra could also help with desire disorders in cases where women don’t believe in sexual double standards for reason in #2. 8. She says, “Orgasm isn’t a genital response.” Imagine saying this about to men about their orgasms. Orgasm is induced by genital stimulation, is perceived/experienced by the brain, and involves a pattern of genital response (series of contractions, etc). 9. She says, “In one study, 2 out of 11 women experienced orgasm without vaginal contraction.” Relying on self report to determine when orgasm has occurred, which the study does, is idiotic. I would bet my life savings that a simultaneous functional MRI would prove these women simply are not having orgasms and don’t know what they feel like. 10. She says that the belief that women’s genital arousal and psychological arousal should be as aligned as men’s is caused by “the patriarchy.” In reality, it is women holding onto patriarchal ideas about sex that causes arousal nonconcordance. Women who do not buy into patriarchal sexual double standards themselves have male-pattern arousal concordance. This is all I have energy for for now. There are more errors on topics of responses to sexual assault, more comments that facts should be discarded in favor of coddling feelings, etc."

3.5 stars - good
First, a note on my rating: I would have given it four stars for being ""very good/really liked"" but... It seemed like every page or so Dr. Nagoski said, ""they're the subject of chapters 2 and 3"" or ""and in chapter 5, I'll show..."" Then in Chapter 9 (the final chapter) we got a lot of ""in chapter 8, I talked about..."" and ""remember from chapter 4."" I found all of these references to be distracting, as I don't remember or look for specifics in this way.EDIT/UPDATE: I give the information shared in this book a full five stars. My 3.5 star rating is just how I felt after finishing this book (four long days after starting it).Come as You Are has a lot of incredibly valuable information in it. I didn't read this to help me with anything. Rather, I read it because Book Riot said it was worth reading: ""It’s hard not to love a book with a pseudo-vagina on the front; it’s even harder not to love that same book for smashing all the preconceived ideas we have about female (and by comparison, male) sexuality.""I'm glad I read it, as I did learn several very important and interesting things: One is that nonconcordance is a thing. (!!!) If your genitals react to something, all that means is that the something is sexually relevant. It DOES NOT mean that you're aroused by that something. (This explains a lot, so I really appreciated learning this fact.)Another valuable lesson I'm taking away from this book is that everyone is made up the same parts, just organized a little differently. We're all 100% NORMAL. (But pain is not normal. If you have pain, seek medical help.) I also appreciated learning the difference between spontaneous and responsive desire. And again, just knowing that ""I AM NORMAL"" is a great thing to know.Another great thing to know? That all of the vaginal orgasms I read about in romance novels are actually not experienced by a majority of women in real life. So again, I'm normal! Yay! (And if that was oversharing, too bad. lol) Of course, even if I were or you are the type of woman who can experience an orgasm from penetration, I would be/you are still normal. ;-)I think this book should be required reading in high school sex-ed classes (or even earlier; when did I take my first sex-ed class?). All of Dr. Nagoski's talk about gardens is something every girl should know and understand. And boys/men should read this book, too. It has good information for them to know both for themselves and to help them understand their partners, too.So in short, this is a valuable book, with very important things to say. I'm very glad I read it. EDIT/UPDATE: After saving my review, I read over my status updates at the bottom of the page and there are a few things there that I want to share here, too:1. Quotes that I really, really liked (I laughed out loud!):From Chapter 2 (pages 66-67): So far in this chapter, you've been a sex researcher in the '60s, a sex therapist in the '70s, a pharmaceutical researcher in the late '90s, and a male lab rat with a lemon fetish.From Chapter 6 (page 218): Only you can tell your partner what you want and how you feel. Not all women feel equally comfortable talking about their desire and arousal, but you can shortcut with ""yes"" or ""more"" or ""blrgpfh!""2. ""Sex is not a drive, like hunger. It's an 'incentive motivation system,' like curiosity..."" (from the tl;dr section of Chapter 7; page 257)And that's now all I wanted to say, I think. But before I save this review and call it ""done,"" I have just one last thing to say:Nonconcordance is a thing! Listen to what a woman says, not what her body is doing! Arousal happens in the brain. ""The best way to tell if a woman is aroused is not to notice what her genitals are doing but to listen to her words."" (page 222)"

Dit zou onderdeel moeten zijn van de literatuurlijst voor Nederlands in de eerste klas. Of in dit geval Engels, want daarin heb ik m gelezen. Maar wat ben ik blij met dit boek. Ondanks dat het non-fictie is, leest het heel lekker omdat het niet zo droog is (toepasselijk haha). Helaas is het niet zo dat dit boek magischerwijs al je problemen oplost, maar het biedt wel heel veel antwoorden en inzichten die je helpen met het creëeren van een positiever beeld over je seksualiteit en jezelf. Absoluut een aanrader voor iedereen, ja ook mannen, die het idee heeft dat hun seks niet altijd werkt zoals het zou moeten werken. Belangrijkste les: de wereld heeft tegen je gelogen, maar jij bent normaal zoals je bent en je moet er zelf achter komen wat wel en niet werkt voor jou, niemand anders kan jou dat vertellen, maar dit boek kan je wel helpen dat te vinden en te begrijpen."

All women to the table please!(Caveat: In this context, by women, I mean exclusively cisgender females... as the author herself specifies in the introduction for this book)Okay, listen. To say that ""self help"" is not my genre of choice would be a huge understatement. I rarely choose self help for myself because I tend to not really care for people giving me their subjective opinions of how I should live my life. That being said, this book was chosen by my Nashville Badass Babes Bookclub, and of course I wanted to be able to be part of the conversation, so I read it. O.M.G.This book spoke to me on so many levels. Let me stop quickly and just comment on the cover. If I saw this book on a shelf at the store, I would probably NEVER pick it up just because of the cover. I tend to stray away from book covers that resemble vaginas (or as this author would have you clarify, ""vulvas""). But I'm so happy I didn't let the cover deter me. Come as You Are is so much more than a book about sex. I mean... yes.. it does have a lot of reference to sex. It has a vulva on the cover for crying out loud. But, so much of the content was relatable to other elements of life and translatable to many different scenarios. Communication. Body Image. Loving Ourselves as We Are. Being Kind to Ourselves. Working Through Problems. Just So Many Good Moments of Personal Reflection!And it was funny. Emily Nagoski found a way to put scientific subject matter in relatable, conversational words. She inserted humor and some snarky attitude. I felt like I was reading a letter from one of my girlfriends, joking around about various sexual topics. For anybody who reads and enjoys The Skimm (a semi-snarky, quick-witted daily newsletter targeted towards women), this had a very similar tone and vibe. I don't do this often, but I would highly recommend purchasing this book in print. I'm usually impartial to whether I listen to a book or rent it from the library... and tend to not purchase a lot of books because... well... $$$. But in this case, I think the purchase is entirely worthwhile. There are activities throughout the book after several chapters where the author encourages you to self-reflect and jot down some personal notes. And I found the activities really meaningful and worthwhile. I took the time to complete them, marking up the pages in red pen for my own reference at a later date. I would encourage anybody who reads it to do the same. I guess that about sums it up. This book is a ""must read"" for women everywhere. If nothing else, just to hear the words:You are normal. You are beautiful. Women aren’t broken versions of men; they’re women."
302,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1848040-gabriella-gricius,Rating 5 out of 5,"Why Read: I'm not exactly sure where I found out about this book, but the second I read the summary - I knew I had to read it. Women my age (early 20s), at least as far as I've seen, are all confused about their sexuality- whether they're in their own words under-active or too active. So it only seems perfectly timed that we finally can have a book dedicated to us.Review: I don't usually read non-fiction. In this particular case, however, I found myself reading on the train, walking and even when I was on the toilet (TMI, I know). Come as You is one of those ""pop culture"" science books that is easily readable for us normal people, but carries all of the science that it needs. I think every woman should be reading this book, because it's really important.Emily Nagoski has two basic points. 1) Every woman's sexuality is different (whether that is sex drive, what turns you on, or off) and 2) Context is everything. Why can't you get it up? You're probably putting yourself in the wrong sorts of situations. As someone with *basically* no experience, I found these points not only really useful, but also enlightening in a very personal way. Our society tells us that to be sexually active in high school is *slutty* but that come to college, and it's still *slutty* but more acceptable. Our TV shows show us lonely powerful women who sleep around, and are morally find with it. As a young adult in this world, I've tried to conform to the societal morals with little to no success. Before reading this book, I would probably blame it on myself, my upbringing, etc. However, now I know there isn't anything to blame. My context for sexuality and my own personal sexuality simply doesn't conform 100% with societal norms, and that's okay.So yes, this is a science book - but it's also a self-help book. It's a really beautiful look at women in our time period and how society plays a role in how we see ourselves sexually. The topic was also appreciated because it's difficult to pick up books like this without some sort of caveat. The science aspect of this book, for me, seemed to validate the sexual portion of it until I got far enough into it that no validation was needed. If I want to explore my sexuality, then I can.It's written in a beautiful style and it's very ""interactive,"" with worksheets to figure out what your context might be, or what turns you on or off. I would recommend for everyone to read this - because it truly had an impact on how I see myself, and I would want everyone to be exposed to this. So go read! Highly Recommended!Rating: 5/5 Stars"

304,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31776311-hint,Rating 4 out of 5,"Vine por la ciencia y la información pero me quedé por la crítica cultural de cómo el sexo, el deseo y la concordancia entre excitación genital y mental se venden y se normalizan tomando a los hombres cis como referentes, cuando el deseo en mujeres cis normalmente no es espontáneo sino contextual y receptivo (y ahí entra factores de estrés y cómo completarlo en vez de suprimirlo, de imagen corporal y body-shaming, del discurso cultural de lo 'normal' y de los cortocircuitos que preceden) donde el deseo no se basa tanto en añadir elementos excitantes como en quitar aquellos que inhiben, de cómo la respuesta genital no se corresponde necesariamente con la mental y viceversa (premisa que, de no tenerse en cuenta, bien puede justificar una violación - cosa que ya se da), y de cómo el deseo no es ningún instinto irrefrenable ni un impulso, sino algo que se construye con el contexto. El libro habla mayormente de mitos hallados en nuestra cultura, en la literatura y en el porno vs. ciencia, de cómo la sociedad quiere una mujer sexual perfecta (siempre dispuesta a tener sexo y fácilmente excitable) mientras esta manda diferentes mensajes sobre cómo debería ser tu moral, tu cuerpo y tu ritmo dando por 'natural' lo que funciona para los hombres cis. El libro va mucho más allá de la sexualidad ya que no podemos comprender esta de forma aislada, y por tanto no puede hablarse de una pastilla o 'viagra' femenina sin comprender todos los factores que tienen lugar. Tiene diferentes guías y pasos para aquellas personas que no se sienten bien con algunos aspectos de su sexualidad y quieran cambiarlos, pero ante todo normaliza cosas que se dan por problemáticas y disfuncionales. Es un libro que al terminarlo te quedas con una gran tranquilidad al pensar que la mayoría del discurso que venden en los medios es total BS, que quizá ya se intuye, pero hay muchas creencias asimiladas que no se han elegido, como mitos en torno al himen, a la excitación, al orgasmo, etc. que todo el mundo tiene y que el libro deconstruye muy bien.

305,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31816876-nate-delgado,Rating 4 out of 5,"I first heard about this from a friend who was palpably anxious while describing it. I was fascinated by a book purporting to help women become more confident that ended up making a pretty sexually confident friend insecure. The fascination turned into a casual book club. I think it’s an incredibly important book. I unequivocally support the message. God knows we need more media explaining how you’re normal and not broken. But I take issue with the delivery.For a book avowedly science-focused, it’s frustrating to feel Nagoski does much to reduce and even misconstrue the science. For example, I think it’s ridiculous she puts notes at the back of the book instead of using footnotes. It’s like she let her central premise (persuading women they’re not broken) get in the way of treating her audience with intellectual respect. Just because someone is insecure about their body or sexuality does not mean they’re afraid of graphs and footnotes. Despite dozens of worthy data points screaming to be presented visually, there is not a single chart or table in the over three-hundred page book. She prefers to dangle a single statistic from complex studies with lots of interesting and relevant context, with only a superscript number to help you traipse through the Notes section in the back. When you make it to the right note, instead of finding a description of the complexity, or any of the interesting and relevant context, most often there’s merely a watered down citation. Just like how she feels it’s her role to “translate the science of women’s sexual well-being into Manly Fix-It Dude-Speak” for husbands, she appears to feel it’s also her role to keep her readers away from anything that could be too complicated, like a basic synopsis of how studies were conducted, or important and related findings besides the one or two numbers that help make one singular point in her prose. She doesn’t cut it all out. Some studies she explains thoroughly. Others she neglects entirely. I just wish she consistently provided an easy way of accessing the background, basic methodology, and conclusions of studies she cites. This is especially important because I came across multiple data points that were misleading (presenting data collected from a survey on her blog as if it were from a peer reviewed study) or even erroneous (statistics used in the prose directly conflicting with statistics cited in the corresponding note). If she’s going to rely on the concept of “science equals truth” to make her points, I’d like to see her be accurate in her summaries or verbose in her citations. She is neither. It feels weird for her to be so concerned about her readers “making it” through the more science-heavy sections and then using wordy and complex Jane Austen or obscure, old movie references to explain things.Other puzzling things include her mentioning lube and its wondrous powers 31 times, including a warning to “choose your lube wisely [because] not all lube is created equal,” but then failing to mention the very real and very preventable dangers of mixing common types of lubes with common types of condoms and toys. It’s the kind of thing that would have been perfectly suited for a simple table. Or how she has an entire section on anatomy, including detailed descriptions of the male sex organs, but neglects to describe the uterus, ovaries, or fallopian tubes. I get the book is about sex and focuses on the external genitals, but it’s also oriented around a mission of providing trustworthy, fact-based sexual education. It’s baffling she has room to explain and diagram the penis but none for the womb.The idea that most exemplifies her mix-and-match attitude towards explaining reality is her insistence “we’re all made of the same parts, just arranged differently.” Here too, I readily agree with her message and overall point: There’s no reason to be self conscious about your body and it’s an interesting biological quirk that male and female genitals start out as the same flesh before morphing into their respective shapes. It’s the way she gets to this conclusion that’s weird and indicative of her allergy to simply explaining the truth. She starts by saying the female genitals have been mischaracterized for centuries and have been misogynistically labeled and described for their purported “shame” for being internal, or hidden inside the body, compared to the penis which proudly stands out of the body. Got it. Then she explains how it’s wrong to shame the female genitals because in fact the clitoris does stand out just like a penis. I hate this explanation for multiple reasons. One, why does a clitoris have to be like a penis to lack shame? Two, why can’t it simply be wrong to shame any genitals for any reason? Three, this point minimizes what makes the female anatomy so special. Instead of condemning shame and judgment, and saying clits are cool for their clit-ness, she tries to make the roundabout argument that clits are cool because they’re made from the same parts as penises. She says “female genitals appear “hidden” only if you look at them through the lens of cultural assumptions rather than through the eyes of biology” and I say “No! They appear hidden because 75% of the clitoris is literally inside the body, as are 100% of the reproductive organs you tell us nothing about.” She later explains how much of both the penis and the clitoris are internal, so I scratch my head as to why she introduces the clit as if it’s not hidden and as if the only reasons for it possibly feeling that way are cultural. I don’t think this specific idiosyncrasy is particularly damaging, but these subtle distortions of reality feel like a recurring rhetorical device used in the name of comforting the audience. Like her weaseling out of considering sex a drive because lack of it doesn’t kill you the way lack of water does. Or her damnation of drug companies trying to make a drug supporting women who have stubbornly low sexual appetites because it’s perfectly healthy to have a low sexual appetite. I agree it’s perfectly healthy and I agree the development and marketing of the drug was probably steeped in misogyny, but those are dumb reasons to avoid making drugs that could make people feel better. We make drugs to treat non-pathological nuisances all the time. Heck, is birth control not a prescription drug given to healthy women to prevent something that may make their lives unpleasant? I love what Nagoski is trying to do here, and I think the book makes great strides in sexual education. I learned a lot myself! And I felt inspired by many of the stories and anecdotes. There were even a few moments where I wanted to shout from the rooftops a snippet of handy wisdom. I wish she had been a little more faithful in her reporting of the science, but I don’t think that should stand in the way of this book making the positive impact it so obviously can and does. I’d happily and confidently recommend it to anyone struggling with shame, confusion, or insecurity in their sexuality."

307,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book made me want to shout everything I learned from a rooftop. It made me think about how I could work it into every conversation I had. It STILL makes me want to do these things. Come As You Are should be a mandatory read for any woman who is sexually active or plans on being sexually active at some point AND MEN. That's right. Any man who is sexually interested in women should be required to read this book. Not only will it help them understand how a woman's sexuality functions, it also gives a glimpse into all the insecurities and issues women face from society about accepting their sexuality. There's also the added bonus of learning a bit about how male sexuality generally works as well (TOTALLY different than a woman's mostly).A major point of this book is that what's going on in your life, BOTH past and present, affect your sexual desire and performance. And because of that, the author provides ways to help with those things that may be affecting your sexual life. BUT working through said issues (like self-esteem issues, past trauma, etc.) will probably help you even in the non-sexual parts of your life. It definitely helped me on days I was struggling with body issues.The book is enjoyable, funny, and easy to read, not at all textbook-y. The author also gives plenty of examples to help her readers understand the science-heavy parts. For those worried about that. ;) She also includes a very useful tl;dr section at the back of each chapter where she summarizes the chapter. I cannot rave enough about this book and how big a step it is in the direction of positivity towards female sexuality. No woman is broken, we're all just different. And that's normal."

Added to my list of facts I am gonna tell people about on the next party!Some of the things in the book that made me go "":-O"" while reading: 1. No one really knows what the hymen is for and yet it is one of the most discussed body parts ???2. The female orgasm has no evolutionary function (and yet is so much fun)3. Why sex with an abuser is 50 times better and what's wrong with that4. Monogamy is NOT the problem It is amazing how she touches so many subjects in the book without it getting too big or too much. Nagoski manages to do the balancing act and writes both scientifically and reader-friendly. And, boy, is there a lot of myths I agreed on and did not know about. I liked that she also added an appendix with the science and papers she used for the books which makes it a whole lot more approachable. The one thing I did have to get used to was her writing style as it seemed to my kind of over the top but I guess that comes with writing a science book for a public audience.She has a talent for inventing funny allegories or examples that carry her message!It is practical. It is helpful. It teaches you how to be gentle with yourself. (The fact that she repeated that we are all normal and all beautiful annoyed me in the beginning and then - when I allowed it - made me tear up everytime). This aspect was my favorite part about the book because she got into big detail about how emotions and context work (in relationships and sexual relationships) and I felt like I just attended a very good therapy session with my therapist.This is definitely a book I'd recommend to all of my friends."

I have often said that we don't often need to learn something new as much as we need to be reminded of things. That is the case here.My sex life looks different now than it did 2 years ago. So different parts of the book attracted/called to me. I would suggest a re-read of this book every few years as it can't hurt to be reintroduced to your always changing physical body, emotions and sex life. 2020 review: If you have a vagina, it would behoove you to educate yourself with this book! I wish I would've had this book at my fingertips when I was 20 or the VERY LEAST when I was first married in a solid relationship. The author talks about female anatomy, what causes arousal and desire, how to become comfortable with your partner during sex, etc. There are so many myths about sex, female response, etc. that is perpetuated in our American culture that the author ""debunked"" and explained. That was a breath of fresh air!For the rest of my life (unless and until a book with new research comes along) I will recommend this book! Also, another book every human with a vagina should read - The Vagina Bible: The Vulva and the Vagina—Separating the Myth from the Medicine."

My bad for taking one blog comment book recommendation on the fly. This book was crap. Just read chapter 9. Skip the rest. Well, maybe don't skip the appendix, the extended orgasm portion was interesting. Though, you could find this info in a quick Google search as far as instructions go. For as much education as this author has, I'm surprised it read like a 5 year olds advise. I suppose I'm more self aware than others. I've researched mindfulness and read many sex books and relationship books over the last decade +. So this book didn't offer me anything new or eye opening. Her use of metaphors was driving me crazy! Her writing style was condescending to any woman who has truly come into her own. Her thoughts read like the movie memento. Leaping from time to space, and spacing straight off the point to a freaky loop around, back to more nonsense. Super repetitive, fragmented thoughts and structure. Which I suppose could be helped with an editing. I was really hopeful about this book. I'm thinking hard if there's anything I learned from this book......... Hmm.... .. Still thinking... Right, what was I saying? Oh yes. I could have read 4 or 5 complete books in the time span it took me to read this one. Such a waste of time. I don't usually write such snarky reviews.

311,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85352-melle,Rating 5 out of 5,"After reading the fourth rave review about this one on Book Riot, I had to request it for our library (as we have been seriously lacking contemporary materials on healthy female sexuality and sexual wellbeing, let alone science-based and sex-positive materials) and also for myself (because it sounded intriguing and I like science). HOLY BALLS, THIS BOOK IS AWESOME! Conversational tone, well-researched, informative, interactive exercises, super sex-positive, shame-free, encouraging, thoughtful, funny, smart, and a great addition to personal and community libraries. Dr. Nagoski tries to be inclusive but notes we are still lacking a lot of research for our LGBTQIA people so the book is geared more towards cis-women and their partners. Basically, this book exists to help women (and their partners, too) understand and accept their bodies and genitals -- however they're arranged -- as normal and beautiful, to understand their sexuality and all the physical/mental/environmental factors that contribute to it, and to learn more about science-based research with direct implications for one's own sexual wellbeing. My one gripe is that the title/subtitle sounds a little too self-helpy, whereas this is so much more of a comprehensive overview of female sexuality with enlightening, empowering information. "

Bodies really are no different, ""beautiful"" just happens to be a very loaded term. But just as I get annoyed when people say a certain dialect is ""ugly"" or some phoneme ""hurts their ears,"" I can see why the author would be annoyed by those kinds of comments about bodies and that it is important to point out that bodies are natural and beautiful for what they are. The book was okay. It's not as if the conclusions are exactly ""surprising new science that will transform your sex life,"" it is more like the conclusions are ""really sensical but newish findings that will help you make some changes to your sex life."" :) There are worksheets to help you identify your ""ons"" and ""offs"" (a huge section of the book is about ons and offs. This is a very simple concept and, I'm sorry author, I think you could have made this a lot shorter. I understand lots of examples helps people really come to grips with ideas that go against cultural norms, though). The appendices are actually very interesting, too. I appreciated the tons of references she used to back up why are some people like this and other people like that, that was indeed helpful for an over-analyzer like myself. "
313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1261020-zoe,Rating 5 out of 5,"If I ever write a list of Required Reading, this will be Numero Uno. I didn't pick this up looking to ""transform my sex life."" Genuinely. I was curious about my own sexuality and I had a lot of very basic questions that didn't get addressed in my public school education, or by my parents. I was interested in my own body (or women's bodies in general), how they work, and my health. I wasn't interested in sex tips, so the promise on the cover almost turned me off the book, but looking for good books about sex is difficult and this one was the only one ever recommended to me. Plus, it was in front of my face, and I thought the cover was funny, so I started reading. It is a great resource for finding a vocabulary to talk about sex, explains the science simply with engaging examples and stories using a great writing style (I want to be friends with Emily Nagasaki), and it breaks down structures of society distinguishing structures and assumptions about sex from what is actually true, and it's about dealing with stress and .... it's about more than sex. The fact that my sex life improved after reading this book just seems like a pleasant side effect or an afterthought. You can pretty much take the word ""sex"" out of any sentence, and apply it to some other aspect of your life and you'll be good. Read it. Even just read some of it. It's worth it. You'll be happy you did. "

Even for the lucky (I guess) women, such as myself, who don't experience the ""technical"" blockages the author speaks of (with kindness and method at the same time). Even if you too are part of the lucky 15%, you will find it refreshing and informative. And liberating.Because this book is much more about the brain than it is about the vulva. About social and emotional context (stress and attachment) and the ""map"" that was given to us (morals, media discourse and social norms and prejudice), all of them leading to self-criticism and not being able to like ourselves. And Emily Nagosky sure gives all of us hope (and tools) to forget about the fake map and get back in touch with the terrain (the reality of our body's needs).As she so greatly puts it, the world has been lying to women about their bodies (how they should experience pleasure and how they should feel about the experience); we have been treated as ""objects of sexual desire but not subjects of sexual pleasure"". And it's all up to us to be who we are and enjoy it, she concludes. It's not just a sex book, it's an intelligent, funny, well-written story of feminism. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that it gets repetitive and sel referential quite a lot. But I would still strongly recommend it to all women and to the men in our lives."
315,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46988975-leigh,Rating 2 out of 5,"DNF at 32%. I'm puzzled by how many people seem to like this book. Mildly informative, but not compelling at all. Kind of just lists simplified versions of a lot of different science and therapeutic approaches without doing much to distinguish between them, and leaves out a lot of factors that would complicate the author's preferred model of human sexuality. She justifies this by saying that she selected only the science that has a therapeutic benefit, but I think that over-simplifying actually makes the scientific info LESS therapeutically effective, not more. I also have an issue with her presenting some of these straightforward neurological theories as if they describe how everyone's brain works, which can be counter-productive for those of us with complicating factors of depression, anxiety, neurodiversity, etc (i.e all of us). IDK, I find this simplified sampling of scientific info super ineffective and scientifically, culturally, and psychologically suspect, but I've heard so many people reference this book with glowing reviews, so it must be helpful for many. My recommendation would be to skip this and read Becoming Cliterate instead - imo that one does a much better job of synthesizing relevant scientific info in a way that is therapeutically effective, and of contextualizing this info within the social and psychological contexts that affect women's sexual health."

It's a book about lady parts! *snicker snicker snicker*Jeez, I'm immature. I won't get too detailed about the, ahem, mechanics of Come as You Are because I would never do it justice. Nagoski, however, does. She approaches the subject of women and their differing sexualities in a way that’s refreshing and takes the dang pressure off. Her resounding message: you're normal.Yes, with all of your complexities and hang-ups and quirks, you’re normal and just as deserving of love as anyone else.She gives the partners respect as well (that includes men). They aren't the source of women's issues, nor are they the sole solution. But their love and support sure is vital. In her scenarios, the partners are the real MVPs. She just lays (heehee, ""lays"") everything out so nicely and makes everything seem less fraught with drama. Women aren’t a problem to be solved or fixed. It's more a process of figuring out what type of puzzle you're dealing with, how to put the pieces together, and enjoying the process. "
317,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6615400-oliver-brackenbury,Rating 5 out of 5,"COME AS YOU ARE is written with cisgender women (of any sexuality) in mind, which is obviously fine! Not being one, I don't feel comfortable saying with any authority how useful this book would be to someone who identifies that way - though I will happily guess that the answer to that is ""VERY Useful, most likely"".Meanwhile I think it's worth mentioning how a lot of other people could benefit from it as well - certainly cisgender men who are attracted to women. Not to imply that this book contains the Konami Code For Lady Parts, but it contains a great deal of knowledge which can increase empathy and understanding of what female partners may be feeling, which is good, and a great deal of the suggestions/exercises in the book would be useful for men to consider re:their own sexuality.The metaphors and occasional Internet baby talk (ex. FEELS) might not be for you, some of them certainly weren't for me, but it's worth looking past them to the knowledge they are expressing. I've said before that some form of the book SEX AT DAWN should be part of the sexual education curriculum and now I'd also add a condensed version of this book to my sex-ed textbook fan-fiction!"

Some women easily orgasm from penetration, and it seems to be a function of where the clit is positioned in relation to the vagina, NOT inhibition or immaturity. Some women will never orgasm from penetration, and that's normal too.It's all a matter of not just finding your turn-ons (your gas pedal) AND learning what steps on the brakes for you. And if there was one huge take-away from this for me, it was that wetness =/= arousal for women. We can be wet and not aroused. We can be aroused AND wet, or we can be aroused and not wet. Needing lube has NOTHING to do with being unwomanly. Need lube? USE lube. Make lube your best friend (because it is).Lots of good anecdotal stories to illustrate the points of each chapter.

Book clubs, college first-year reader, health class, whatever. Dr. Nagoski outlines in a clear, concise and often humorous manner, how humans react to sex. Most importantly, women are not men, and don't necessarily have the same speed, intensity or affinity toward sex. Yes, that seems obvious, but how many women feel like they're broken, repressed or just 'not normal' because they don't feel spontaneous desire for their love interest? Or can't orgasm through intercourse? Or can't 'close the deal' if the kids are too loud or the room is too cold, or you had a stressful day at work? Dr. Nagoski explains the brakes and accelerators that affect our ability to enjoy sex. Best part? She has worksheets that help you identify what you like, how you are likely to respond and what you can change about your relationship...and your life...to be more open to having, and enjoying, this natural act. Read it. I guarantee you will read something that benefits you-sexually, socially or emotionally. Plus, it will make you laugh. "

It's more about how the narrative women are told about who we are sexually is wrong, and how, consequently, we feel like we are somehow wrong. And we're not- but to really get that, there is a lot of science to unpack. There are a LOT of metaphor here to help the reader digest the science. Some of them worked really well for me: accelerator/brakes,* sexual ""scripts,"" maps/terrain. Some never really clicked for me: the emotional ""One Ring,"" the sleeping hedgehog, the brain as a ""flock of birds. "" (I was pretty neutral on the ""garden"" metaphor.) The problem is that she goes back to these through the book, so if a metaphor doesn't work for you, you're stuck with it and you're like ""I STILL don't get how my brain is like a flock of birds"" or ""wtf is the sleeping hedgehog again?"" * This alone was worth reading the book for me.

With compassion and understanding for ourselves and the right context with our partners, we can and should enjoy our sexuality as it is. This was especially helpful for me because of my religious upbringing, which had a heavy emphasis on sexual purity and chastity within marriage, but unfortunately did not go in depth beyond sexual platitudes; other information filtered through American pop culture which can be explicitly sexual in a way that conveys harmful messages about women and sexuality."

Yes, there were some metaphors that were a little hard to go with and the language is very casual in a way that makes you feel like you're listening to a friend, but I didn't mind that at all. The main thing for me is... I've always had issues with my sexuality and culture and family and one REALLY not-so-great relationship didn't help me feel any healthier. The main point of this book is YOU'RE NORMAL, which, hey, I really needed to hear. There's also a lot about desire and responsiveness that was really interesting and enlightening.

And yes, for many, the information that Nagoski presents through all kinds of metaphors and various stories, has the potential to be life-changing.
