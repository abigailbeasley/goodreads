Wondering if somebody would be kind enough to provide you with that one review which would appeal to your tastes.I have EXACTLY what you're looking for, but why would I provide it for you? I'm thinking No. Go ahead: tell me. Why would I bother saving your time with an eloquent and thorough review that would Definitely appeal to you and surely help you decide? Go ahead: tell me.Are you done?The answer is the same: it ain't happening. It seems you're wasting your time. The answer is a big, fat No.What now?It seems you're a little stuck right now, doesn't it? My answer doesn't sound it'll change anytime soon--I mean, I'm not the kind of guy who keeps checking his reviews and keeps editing them accordingly, so now what? Looks like you could use some of the tips found in this book. Wasn't it about negotiating?Hmm. . ."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20011606-paige-halper,Rating 1 out of 5,"**Edit as of 5/31/22: It appears I’ve gotten under some people’s skin. Welcome to the exchange of ideas, friends! I understand that your comment means you really want my attention and read what I have to say! That’s awesome. I, however, don’t give a shit about what you have to say. You’re free to comment and I’m free to ignore it. LMFAO.**Did I really just read 288 pages of a white dude describing the world and how he manipulates others to ""get the right answer"" to his questions? I feel sick. With the preface, you really believe Voss is the expert in his field (and a humble expert, which is refreshing beyond belief). But you'll also start to realize about 15 pages in that Voss' techniques only work because he lives in a world where everyone is systematically inclined to make men like him happy (either for fear of retribution or because they are men who hope Voss' success mirrors (hey, I used his favorite word!) their own). The world already accommodates him.Can't wait for Never Split the Difference 2: A Woman's Perspective. It would be about 250 pages shorter because no one takes her seriously enough to answer her questions and instead asks to speak with the man in charge."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10547530-mark,Rating 5 out of 5,"One of the best books I've read over the last few years. In my opinion, the title does NOT do it justice. While this is applicable to negotiating, and the title DOES highlight a critical component, this book is valuable to MANY types of negotiating, even situations that we may not consider to be negotiating... things that happen every day. This borrows heavily from behavioral and neuro science areas to get at the way people work (all of us). It of necessity helps gain trust. It helps in understanding others and what their true motives are, so you can meet their needs. This can be applied whether you are negotiating for just helping someone. It's an amazing book... there are only about 4 books that I will repeat (maybe more than a 2nd time). This is DEFINITELY one of them. Thanks for an amazing lesson and reference, Chris! You're amazing."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,Rating 3 out of 5,"A lot of what affects how much you enjoy these books is, again, how self aware you are or how much consideration you've given to how you talk to people and the best way to get what you want from others. If you already easily have any easy time convincing people, or have thought about it and are self aware of how you behave and talk to others then I don't think any of these things are going to be surprising or helpful but if you haven't ever actually considered the way you interact with people then maybe this will be an eye opening book for you. Personally I think I've always been a little manipulative so I wasn't all that impressed. The writing was average also so the books clear and easy to read but I wasn't impressed by the writing either."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/176152654-ugvaja-maks,Rating 5 out of 5,"Voss's years of experience as a former FBI hostage negotiator shine through in this insightful book, providing practical strategies for navigating difficult conversations and achieving mutually beneficial outcomes. Narrated by Voss himself, the audiobook edition brings his expertise to life with clarity and authority. What sets in this book apart is its emphasis on empathy and active listening as key tools in negotiation. Voss's approach, rooted in human psychology and real-world negotiation scenarios, offers valuable insights for both professional and personal interactions.From the concept of ""mirroring"" to the power of ""tactical empathy,"" Voss shares actionable techniques that have the potential to transform your negotiation skills. As someone who has honed his craft over decades, I appreciate Voss's practical advice and nuanced approach to communication.With a wealth of positive reviews, it's clear that Voss's methods resonate with readers from all walks of life. Whether you're a business executive, a parent, or simply someone looking to improve your communication skills, this book is an indispensable guide to achieving success in negotiation."
5,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"While I enjoyed reading the book, I couldn't help realize it was mainly about how to manipulate and use people in order to get your way. No matter how Chris worded his stories, examples, and techniques it all sounded like he is teaching ""how to use others for your personal (or business's) gain. I honestly felt dirty reading it as it does teach how to be a horrible person to others while smiling and coming off as a great person. I'll say as some one with high functioning autism and learning ""to be human"" (communicate and function normally in conversation) it does help me to see just how evil people can actually be, and avoid them. I learned from this book, the signs of manipulation and deception when talking with people or negotiating. I get why top business people and those who deal with negotiating on a daily basis would read this book and learn from it. Good book for power/money hungry business people and good for those who want to learn how to avoid them."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1216206-rita-arens,Rating 5 out of 5,I actually TOOK NOTES on this book.
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12925436-annie,Rating 4 out of 5,"The book should have been titled ""Start at No in Negotiations."" Often, a ""no"" means ""wait"" or ""I'm not comfortable with that."" Probe deeper and listen carefully to uncover key information behind the ""no"" (such as ""I want to but I don't have the money now"" or ""it is actually my spouse, not me, who doesn't agree""). This is a much more effective approach than trying to get the counterpart to say ""yes,"" which the person might say just to get rid of you.The author, who is a former FBI hostage negotiator, included too many hostage stories. These situations where lives are on the line, the negotiator would never split the difference (e.g., you take 2 hostages and I take 2 hostages) and hence, the book title. But for everyday situations (like negotiating with a family member, buying a car, or working with colleagues), the stories aren't that useful and such a perspective on negotiations isn't practical.I recommend starting with Chapter 9 to understand the types of people in negotiations:Analyst - methodical and diligent; need time to go over facts and consider the optionsAccommodator - builds rapport through a continuous free-flowing exchange of information; not necessarily focused on the desired outcomeAssertive - direct and candid; getting it done quickly is more important than spending more time on getting it done rightThen start from the beginning and practice the skills, including:Mirror - repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said to draw out more information from the personLabel - validate someone's emotions and fears by acknowledging it (such as ""it seems like you feel you're not being appreciated"")Accusation List - list the worst things the counterpart could say about you (such as ""you probably think I don't spend enough time on this project"") and give statements to alleviate that concern (such as ""You can trust me to do my part without supervision"" and ""we all want this project to be successful"").Ask questions, collect information, and consider creative ways to get to your goals (such as non-monetary items - amenities, upgrades, positive reviews, and referrals). There is much more in the book that goes through the nuances of what to say, how to say it, and how to behave. It is a book that you need to read slowly, take notes, and practice the tips before moving on to the next chapter."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34235533-mario-velarde,Rating 5 out of 5,"Fantastic book. While I recommend it to everyone, I almost don't want to give away a competitive edge and prefer no one reads it--it's that good!"
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy,Rating 2 out of 5,"This does not work well as an audiobook because there's a lot of filler and hot air. I agree with the starting premise of the book, i.e. that ""Getting to Yes"" is more or less useless because people aren't robots: When everybody involved is nice and logical, no one needs help with negotiating. Having said that, I'm not sure how especially useful his advice is. Personally, I got much more out of: Talking to Crazy: How to Deal with the Irrational and Impossible People in Your Life

. I would also recommend The Introvert's Edge: How the Quiet and Shy Can Outsell Anyone

. The author there recognizes that introverts have different strengths/weaknesses vs. extroverts and tailors advice for them. Voss, on the other hand, describes himself as an asshole, and seems to think his advice applies to everyone. He doesn't appear to get that for many people a lot of what he recommends is either obvious (listening) or odious (taking maximum advantage of other people's misfortunes). Stuff like haggling for hours at the car dealer is something that gives him years of enormous pleasure, but nowadays would often just be an avoidable waste of time. Some of the advice seems harmless and potentially helpful (e.g. using ""how"" questions) and I'm willing to try that. If it helps, I'll bump up the rating."
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67326390-scienceofsuccess,Rating 5 out of 5,"tl;dr My animated summary of Never Split the Difference is available here: https://youtu.be/pWu6ie-QXjIChris Voss is a former FBI hostage negotiator. If you want to learn how to negotiate, he’s your top teacher. Every chapter in his book is a lesson. Each of them feels like an episode of some crime TV series. Every lesson is based on a real-life example from author’s involvement with hostage negotiations. After the storytelling, Chris explains which negotiating techniques worked and which didn’t. At the end of each chapter, there is a nice wrap-up of the key lessons learned.The author discovered that the same techniques he used in life and death negotiations can be applied to everyday conflicts. Whether you are negotiating with kidnappers, trying to get a raise, or just negotiating “bedtime” with your kid, the principles stay the same. The main rule of negotiations is to remember that you’re dealing with a person who wants to be appreciated and understood.“Never split the difference” is an impressive book, filled with practical knowledge. This is not theoretical science. All of those advices were proven right when someone’s life was on the line. You can’t read it like a textbook. This book is written like a thriller. It’s very absorbing and easy to read. After finishing it I feel like not only my negotiation skills improved, but my social skills overall got better. I believe everyone should read it. Most people don’t wake up every day expecting negotiations, but who knows, maybe tomorrow you’ll have an opportunity to discuss something that’s important to you? I can guarantee that such talk could go WAY better if you read this book.Well deserved 5/5, I'd love to give 6stars here."
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20906001-cori,Rating 5 out of 5,"Recently, I've snagged a couple interesting titles off the Audible deal-of-the-day. This book popped up and the premise was just so interesting, I had to get it for a couple dollars. Chris Voss, the author, was a lead FBI hostage negotiator and haggled with terrorists, kidnappers, and a host of other bad dudes for a lot of years. I had an initial concern that Chris would be authoritarian and a tad bit self-enamored when I bought the book. The only reason for this being that most ""bargain-like-a-boss"" books I've read have been that way. But I figured, you don't get to be the FBI's lead hostage negotiator because of a false sense of importance so I figured I'd give 'er a go. And I'm so glad I did. This book appealed to me because I thought, ""Hey, I can actually use this to negotiate with agitated patients."" But holy moly, Miss Molly. You can use these techniques to smooth out rough conversations with a spouse or family member, ease a tense stand-off with your nine year old that doesn't want to go to bed, and use your super-secret-spy techniques on the vegetable vendor on the side of the road. It's nifty stuff. In reality, the information here is golden. I wasn't flipping through pages thinking, ""I should write the world's most basic book on communication too and make money off it."" This was actually valuable and evidenced-based. So many of these techniques are things I either use with aggressive/agitated patients, or will start using! Some of it, I realized, I use a rendition of, but not well, because I couldn't put my finger on the mechanics behind it. This is so simple, and yet, art. It breaks things down into simple concepts, but shows it takes practice to hone the skills (obviously, otherwise I'd be sauntering into that lead FBI negotiator position myself). Why should we start our questions with ""what"" and ""how""? Why do we want the other guy to say no? When is it helpful to use the late night FM DJ voice vs. the chipper, friendly voice? I know the answers now. And they make a hecka-lotta sense.If you read one self-help, communication, non-fiction book this year, read this one! Also, the Audible narrator was a pleasure to listen to. He did a wonderful job. I'd rate this book a PG for some language and episodes of peril/violence."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,Rating 5 out of 5,"I was prepared to hate this book and lump it in with the whole useless self-help genre (which begs the question why I keep reading those books), but I actually learned a lot. The book is basically a behavioral psychology approach to negotiations. I was taught all the BATNA and rational negotiations strategies in law school, but all those assumptions were based on rationality and lack of feelings. But we now understand that we are more prone to emotional decision making (system 1 or the elephant) as opposed to cool headed reasoned thinking (system 2 and the rider). So this book helps you negotiate (or maybe manipulate?) with our emotional reptilian brains. And to watch out for your own fallacies as well."

14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53209373-simon-clark,Rating 4 out of 5,"A very practical, easy to read book on the various psychological tricks and techniques you can use in persuading people to see things your way. I was recommended to read this with regards to negotiating with brands (making sponsored video content) and it has certainly beefed up my skillset. I've actually already used a bunch of tips from this book outside of formal negotiations, and I can confirm that much as some of the tricks sound unnatural on paper they really do work!As I say, the book is very readable with punchy prose, and the author Chris Voss punctuates each chapter with relevant (and often gripping) anecdotes. To be honest, the only thing that's preventing me from giving this a five star review is a lack of 'wow factor'. This is a book that states its purpose, knows what its talking about, and accomplishes the goals it sets out. But that's it. It wasn't life-changing, but it was very good."
15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david-rubenstein,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a FANTASTIC book! The author, Chris Voss, is an expert hostage negotiator for the FBI. He can never ""split the difference""--a euphemism for compromise--because to compromise in a hostage negotiation is to lose a life or many lives.Voss explains how to negotiate--not just for the FBI, but in any realm of life. So much of his advice sounds completely anti-intuitive. Just as an example, one should not be encouraged by the answer ""Yes"". It is much better to hear the answer ""No"". Why? A ""Yes"" means that your counterpart just wants to get rid of you. A ""No"" means that he is thinking for himself. You want to pose a question that gets a ""No"" response, but in a positive way. For example, ""Do you want to give up on any chance of making a deal?"" would be properly answered by ""No"", which means that your counterpart is thinking on his own, and not pressured to answer ""Yes"". Well, I am probably not explaining this very well, but Voss clearly explains his approaches. He shows how these negotiating tactics work for the FBI, and helps to save lives. These tactics can also be applied to day-to-day negotiations, like asking for a raise, buying a car, and even talking with your spouse.The book is filled with anecdotes that illustrate how negotiations can be very successful--or how ignoring his advice can be the route to failure. I highly recommend this book!I didn't read this book; I listened to the audiobook. The narrator, Michael Kramer, does an excellent job to bring this book to life!"
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1363537-yevgeniy-brikman,Rating 5 out of 5,"Crap title, GREAT book. The premise: the FBI's former chief international hostage negotiator (what a job title!) shares what he learned about negotiation throughout his career. These are the lessons the FBI has learned the hard way—those strategies that have been found to work when people's lives depend on it. And these strategies work not only for hostage negotiation, but in the types of negotiations you come across throughout life: asking a boss for a raise, convincing your kids to take out the trash, haggling over the price of a car, etc. I found a lot of valuable insights in this book. So much, that it took me a few weeks to find the time to jot down all my thoughts here, and it'll take me even longer to internalize it all and start using it regularly. The author now runs a consulting company, so a few bits of the book felt like a marketing pitch, but the vast majority seemed like well thought out, actionable advice.Some of my favorite take aways:* Every person is driven by several primal urges in a negotiation: the need to feel safe; the need to feel in control; the need to be understood. Your goal in a negotiation is to gather as much information as possible to best meet these needs. Most of the items below touch on these basic needs. * Tactical empathy: deeply understand what other person is feeling and what’s driving them. However, understanding that person is not the same as agreeing with that person or feeling sorry for them—that’s sympathy. You want empathy, because when you can understand what's driving someone, you'll be far better at negotiating with them.* There are three ""voices"" you typically want to use in a negotiation. The first voice, and the one you should use by default, is your positive/playful voice: the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person, that is light and encouraging; relax and smile. The second is the late night radio DJ voice: low, smooth, calm, and showing that (a) you're relaxed and confident because (b) you are in control. And the third is the direct/assertive voice, similar to a drill sergeant. You very rarely use the third one.* Mirroring: repeat back to the person the last thing they said, or the most important few words in their last sentence, but use voice intonation to indicate that you want them to expand on that topic—that you're seeking clarification. It gets them to do more talking and feel heard. It gives you more information. * Labeling emotions: give names to the emotions the other person is expressing. Use the phrases ""it seems like,"" ""it sounds like,"" and ""it looks like."" Example: ""It sounds like this is really frustrating you"" or ""It seems like you feel cheated."" After providing the label, go silent. This prompts the other person to respond: either they'll agree (""yea, that's exactly it!"") or they'll correct you (""I'm not frustrated, I'm...""), which case you'll understand them better. The book ""Emotional Agility"" also talks about labeling emotions as an effective way to better deal with your own feelings.* Call out the negative: list all the other person's charges against you up front. Call out all their fears, grievances, and problems, acknowledge them, respond to them, and then invite the other person to add to it. Then, _listen_, and don't judge. Instead, as the person adds other items, label each negative emotion, acknowledge it, and find a way to turn it into something positive. For example: ""It seems like you're concerned that we're a small, relatively unknown company, and what happens if we suddenly go out of business or get acquired? Will you be left hanging? I think this is a valid concern, but the advantage of working with a small company is that we can move much faster, and our license ensures that if we disappear, you're going to be fine because of [...]."" Get the barriers that block progress into the open as soon as possible so you can deal with them pro-actively. * Loss aversion: convince the other side they have something to lose if they don’t sign (and not only something win if they do sign). Humans are loss averse, fearing loss significantly more than valuing wins, so showing them what they lose can often be a bigger motivator than showing them what they gain.* Anchors: start off the bidding (yes, you can say the first number!) with an extreme value to ""anchor"" the negotiation towards the range that favors you. E.g., Offer just 50% of the asking price as the first bid. You can also use ranges to your advantage, with the actual number you want at one end, and your extreme bid at the other: e.g., offer a range of 50-75% of the asking price, with your desired price being at 75%. This can be even more effective if you bring up ranges from external data: e.g., ""At company X they pay $YYY-$ZZZ for this role."" This way, the conversation isn't just about you or your own greed/needs, but about market conditions.* Asymmetry: look for asymmetric trade-offs, such as something the other person can toss in that's cheap for them, but highly valuable for you. In most cases, money is valued equally, so this means looking for non-monetary terms. E.g., If you're a consultant negotiating with a law firm, you might be able to get them to mention you in their next journal/publication, which is cheap for them, but incredibly valuable marketing for you.* Calibrated questions: take one of your demands and phrase it as a question to make it less pushy. E.g., Instead of telling someone, ""you can't take do X,"" you say, “what do you hope to accomplish by doing X?” Ask something that forces them to think through YOUR problem: e.g., ""How am I supposed to know the hostage is OK?"" These questions force the other person to have empathy for your situation. A particular powerful way to ask a calibrated question is to summarize the discussion so far and ask, ""How am I supposed to do that?"" E.g., ""So you want me to sell this below my cost to produce it; how am I supposed to do that?"" You can make these questions a request for help: ""Can you help me figure out a way to get project X done by this deadline if project Y is also due at the same time?"" Use these sorts of questions to guide the conversation. The responder will actually end up doing most of the talking, so they'll feel like they are in control (they'll also feel more committed to the solution, as they will be actively helping to come up with it!), but you're actually guiding them, and forcing them to see things your way. After all, by answering your calibrated questions, they have to make your obstacles theirs and come up with a solution—YOUR solution. A few notes: (a) The question you ask must be *open ended*; it' can't be a yes/no question or a quick factual question, otherwise, they'll answer without thinking, and expect something in return. (b) Don't accuse the person or attack them in the form of a question; instead, guide them to think through the blockers for you. (c) Most of the questions should be ""what"" and ""how"" questions; why is often accusatory, so you probably want to avoid it. Examples:What makes you ask?What about is important to you?How can I help make this better for us?How would you like me to proceed?What is it that brought us into this situation?How can we solve the problem?What’s the objective / What are we trying to accomplish here?How am I supposed to do that? * Aim to not only get a ""yes,"" but also a ""how."" The how is the implementation. If you just get a ""yes,"" but no implementation details, then you may still fail. Use calibrated questions to ferret out the how. E.g., How am I supposed to do that? How will we know we’re on track? How will we address things if we find we’re off track? How does this affect the rest of your team? How on board are the people not on this call? What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?* Backup listener: someone who joins negotiations just to listen. Their job is to listen between the lines while the other person talks. When you're the active participant, you'll often miss critical cues that a backup listener can spot.* Slow down. Most people go way too fast, but if you go too fast, the other person won’t feel like they are being heard. * Strategy for dealing with a ""bulldog"" who tries to aggressively roll over you: (a) Use your late night radio DJ voice. (b) Say ""sorry"": e.g., I'm sorry you're feeling so much pressure. (c) Mirror: make it clear you're seeking clarification. The other person will repeat their message, but in different words, perhaps calmer. (d) Listen silently. (e) Repeat. If you do this over and over, the other person will quickly calm down. If you are being attacked, slow down, pause, count to 10 if you have to: the goal is to let your emotions settle. Then use the previous steps and calibrated questions.* Don't be afraid of ""no."" No is the start of a negotiation—not the end of it. People want the power to say ""no"" (autonomy). Give them that power! Instead of avoiding ""no"" at all costs, try to look for a way to get an early ""no"" to make the other person feel comfortable and in control. Could be as simple as saying, ""well, do you want this project to fail?"" Another one that can work, especially if a customer has stopped responding: ""have you given up on this project?"" Sometimes, you want to intentionally get someone to say no, just to bring them into the conversation: e.g., intentionally mislabel an emotion.* There are three types of yes. The first is the ""counterfeit yes,"" where someone says yes just to move the conversation along, but with no intention of carrying through with whatever they agreed to (e.g., if you push too hard or are too aggressive, people may say yes just to get you to shut up, but they'll weasel out of it later). The second is the ""confirmation yes,"" where someone agrees with something you said, but isn't necessarily going to do anything about it. The third, and the one you really want in a negotiation, is the ""commitment yes,"" where the person intends to follow through. You may want to aim for three such yesses to really flush out any last reservations and to get the person 100% on board.* Look for a ""that’s right!"" from the other person. If you can get them to say ""that's right!"" it means you've finally understood them and they know it. One way to get that is to present a summary of what you understand to be that person's goals/needs/position. If you get it right, the person will agree—and they'll agree with you without feeling like they are ""giving in."" But it's an agreement and it makes them feel understood, which is huge. Note that while ""that's right!"" is very valuable, ""you're right"" is often a disaster. It's not about you; it's about them and their needs.* This book argues against ""compromise."" The argument is that compromises are lazy and avoid pain, but no one ends up getting what they really want. E.g., if the husband wants to wear black shoes and the wife wants him to wear browns hoes, then a compromise or splitting the difference results in the husband wearing one black shoe and one brown shoe—everyone loses. The reality is that good solutions require stress and pain. * Haggling techniques: (a) Figure out your target price. (b) Begin your bidding at around 65% of your target price; then go to 85%, 95%, 100%. The first jump seems really big, and each jump after that is smaller and smaller to make it feel like you're approaching your absolute ceiling. (c) Use non-round numbers; instead of offering $500, offer $512.32, as it makes it seem like you did an exact calculation, and that's truly your ceiling. (d) As they make counter-offers, use calibrated questions to have the person bid against themselves: ""Thank you for your generous offer. I wish I could, but I just can't do that. How could I ?"" * In a negotiation, the other part is NOT your enemy; not even in a hostage negotiation, let alone when negotiating salaries. The only enemy is the situation; the other person you're negotiating with is actually your partner in navigating this situation. * Hopes and dreams: Visualize what the other person wants out of life, and try to use those aspirations to persuade them. Display a passion for what that person wants and lay out a plan for getting them there. Draw a roadmap for how that person can achieve their dreams—change their perception of what's possible—and you will succeed.Phew. That's a lot of useful advice. Perhaps that's the biggest gotcha with the book: there's so much here that it's hard to know how to put it all together. I guess that's where practice comes in! Oh, and as always, I've saved a few of my favorite quotes:“Negotiate in their world. Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It’s about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. So don’t beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals. It’s not about you.” ���'Yes' and 'Maybe' are often worthless. But 'No' always alters the conversation.”“Negotiation is the art of letting the other side have your way.”"

18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/710396-nikolay,Rating 5 out of 5,"I waited for almost a year before reviewing the book - it's a manual for achieving a goal and I wanted to make sure it worked in practice before I had an opinion.Never Split the Difference was my first book about negotiation and I found it both thorough and useful. It has a ton of examples, most of them relatable. While probably we all find hostage situations fascinating, those are not part of my daily routine and negotiation in my life is at much lower stakes.My learnings in the book fell into two main buckets:• Questions to ask myself and area to cover in every negotiation – this includes making sure I understand the other side's motivation and limitations, do enough research, make sure I know what's the highest price I am ready to pay.• Tactical tips – given that I am not super experienced in negotiations, there was a lot that was new to me. Calibrated questions, accusation audit for my side, ideas how to deal with naming a price, making current lack of agreement my fault, instead of attacking the price/belittling the product.Applying those ideas in practice turned out to be not as hard as I thought, so the return of investment of the book has been positive. An interesting side effect I noticed is that I don't avoid negotiation situations as much, because I feel a tiny bit more confident. I see this as another win.After all the praise, I’d like to offer a fair warning to future readers. Most strategies, and especially those relying on specific wording, are heavily dependent on the negotiation happening in the U.S. or in a similar enough culture. For example, both verbatim translations of “How am I supposed to do that?” and the general message sound ridiculous in Bulgarian. Another, similar example is trying to use the “I can't afford this” strategy – the other side shamed me for being poor :-) That said, I found the general framework to be universally applicable.“Never Split the Difference” is for you:✅ If you're new to negotiation.✅ Are okay with following a detailed framework/steps.✅ Want to understand the wider context around this framework, not just get a two-page HOWTO.Requires extra work if:🔸 You're not from a culture close enough to the U.S."

Full of great tips, practical examples and surprising points about negotiating (without the other party feeling they've been cheated), which can be used in business, school, or any casual situation.A few points I've remembered:- Every negotiation starts with a ""no"". If you start with questions leading to ""yes"" (Do you want to help the world? Do you think we should stop animal abuse? ...), the other party will go into defense mode. By getting them to disagree early on, you'll establish boundaries and when they then say ""yes"", they really mean it (commitment yes).- Empathy is important. You can't negotiate without understanding what (and why) the other party wants.I've found this list of more notes you might find helpful, too: https://github.com/mgp/book-notes/blo..."

It's just one more of those ""hard-ass man explains how to be a rational™ hard-ass"" book. It felt like the bland third child to save the marriage between 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People: The Ultimate Revelations Of Steven Covey and Confessions of an Economic Hit Man. Chris Voss is so incredibly full of himself that at time I just had to put the book away. But what about the content?I guess it depends on how many of such guide books you've already read. It's always the same: some nice anecdotes where the author or one of their student comes out on top, ""analysis"" of said anecdote, some disparaging words on how ""theory"" or other methods can't solve the problem, then their solution and in the end a trusty summary in 6 bullet points, just how they learned it in the Harvard MBA Business Enterprise Leadership Harvard Management School of Managers. I can't say that this formula is never useful. I can't say The 48 Laws of Power didn't influence me when I was 14. Sure: These books might provide heuristics if you can't yet think for yourself and might work in some few, highly contrived, certified survivorship bias filtered situations. Fair enough. But in most scenarios, it's just very unlikely to help you. Mostly it just comes down to not be a prick. Listen to the other party. Be honest. What irked me, despite the unscientificness of the claims, is that it always felt manipulative. ""You can even use these tactics with your wife, haha"", is something you wouldn't be surprised to read in that book. Men will literally become crisis negotiators instead of going to therapy.(Just as a small example: He says that you have to give a steep anchor point when negotiating a price. E.g. you only offer 65% of the value of the thing you want. I just cannot fathom, if somebody offered me 65% of the price of a thing that I know very well the price of, that I'd cave. I mean, we can argue about this, but without some nice statistics it's just a baseless claim. And I'm not sure where are with our psychological methodology, Kahnemannian paradigm crumbling and all.)In the last section he talks about ""Black Swans"", basically a hidden piece of information about your adversary that makes you win. He literally references Taleb's The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable but fails to understand it. He talks past the idea and is obviously just intrigued by the aesthetic but I'd bet 5:1 that Taleb would eat Voss alive and call him a charlatan. Even Voss' company is called Black Swan Ltd which is an absolute joke.Everything about this is a joke and now that I wrote this I feel it's even more of a 1.5* than a 2*, so there's that. "
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,Rating 5 out of 5,"Honestly, I got a weird feeling when I first read the title because it felt almost like a call to arms, like I was being told that the idea of compromise was utterly insane... and I was right. It is. But not for the sake of arguing for argument's sake. It's funny, but I really liked this book. Any book that has a call to arms like this but keeps a central tenant like ""tactical empathy"" and ""Really, truly listening to someone"" isn't crazy.And besides, it reminds me of the old story of Solomon and the two mothers who both insist that this one baby is their own and they're totally inconsolable about it. Wise old Solomon commands them to split the baby in half and let each mother take the half they want.That's TOTALLY LEGIT, man.The Solomon story isn't in this book but it ought to be. Instead, the author just went through Quantico and has done an amazing number of successful hostage negotiations and has helped a ton of people get exactly what they want in the business world.How? A hint: he's never belligerent. He listens, mirrors what they're saying, and stays in calm control. And when I mean he listens, he truly, actively tries to understand exactly where the other person is coming from... and then finds a solution. Often it's not even the thing the other person asks for, but simply what they need. Understanding, validation, reassurance that they won't be murdered by cops if they come out with their hands up. Those kinds of things. :)I simplify, of course, but this book has a ton of great practical exercises to diffuse situations and actively engage whomever you're in negotiations with. When there is a consensus, real progress can be made. That means welcoming every ""no"" at the table. That merely defines the context. Yes's are fine, but defining the context will get to the heart of what people really want... and oddly enough, it's usually a lot less than or completely different from what they initially demanded.Of course, it may take a bit more time to figure out the baby situation, but here's a little hint... the mother that screams and gives up her right to the baby probably loves the baby more. I'd trust her."

It means you understood how the person thinks instead of having him dodging you.- “No”: aim for a no question in the beginning instead of always going for “Yes”.- Fairness idea: it’s a great tool to pressure the others proposal- Deadlines: use them to apply pressure and create urgency.- Make them feel like not accepting your offer is a loss.- Questions: always use open ended questions to make them talk and solve your problems: “How” and “What”. Avoid questions that can be answered with yes or no.- Calibrated questions: make your counterpart bid against themselves with these, the most common one is “how am I supposed to do that?”. Basically they’re your way of saying “No” to their proposal but without doing it, this way avoiding to do a counterproposal.- Bargain:  - Always try to make your counterpart bid first, - Give a low/high ball in the beginning to set an anchor - Use ranges to be less aggressive (especially when setting the first price). - Use odd/weird numbers to seem that is the result of a calculation - Negotiate non-cash benefits if their proposal is too low, instead of giving a far number. (“What could you offer me that makes this deal great for both of us?”).- Ackerman system: - Set your target price (goal) - Set your first offer 65% above/bellow target - Calculate three raises of decreasing increments to 85%, 95%, 100%. - Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “no” to get the other to counter before you increase your offer. - When calculating a final amount use a precise, non-round number. - On the final number throw a non-monetary item to show that you’re at your limit. - Black Swan: informations that you don’t know and are game changers. Best way to find them out is to get to know your counterpart personally, ask open-ended questions, make them talk, and listen closely."

But on the other hand... I'm so against conflict. The book made me squirm uncomfortably because his negotiation style seemed often rude, especially when not in hostage situations. Although the author tried to convince me at the end of the book this is an ""OK"" conflict, it's still hard to translate his words into my actions and put this to practice. I'll try though. I specifically would need to reread this book multiple times because it contains so many tips about what and how to say and they all just can't stick with one-time reading. "

The author begins the book by relating his experience at a prestigious seminar at Harvard University. Several of the college's top negotiators put him on the spot to see how he would negotiate in a hypothetical hostage negotiation. The author held his own against the expert negotiators, surprising the professors. How did he do so well? Mr. Voss explains that the methods used by the FBI were developed over time, ""products of experiential learning; they were developed by agents in the field, negotiating through crisis and sharing stories of what succeeded and what failed."" In other words, these tactics HAD to work. If hostage negotiators failed, people literally DIED. The author discovered that the same techniques used in life and death situations could be generalized--they ""made great sense intellectually, and they worked everywhere...In the twenty years I spent at the Bureau we’d designed a system that had successfully resolved almost every kidnapping we applied it to.""NEVER SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE is not just about tricky negotiation tactics, or ways to ""outwit"" your adversary in battle. Whether you are negotiating with kidnappers, or just negotiating a raise, the principles are the same. For example, people always want to be understood and accepted. ""Remember you’re dealing with a person who wants to be appreciated and understood."" This is true no matter the type of negotiation.This also means careful listening, or what the author calls, the martial art of ""Tactical Empathy."" It's nearly impossible to listen to the other side; so, you have to deliberately change your focus: ""Make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. In that mode of true active listening.""Each chapter in NEVER SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE begins with a real-life example from the author's involvement with hostage negotiations. Warning: Many of these cases are brutal, and oftentimes people are hurt, or even killed. After the real case is presented, the author then explains what negotiating techniques worked, and which didn't. At the end of each chapter, there is a nice wrap-up of the key lessons learned.One of the key techniques recommended is to ""Be a mirror."" You simply try to reflect back what is said: ""The intention behind most mirrors should be 'Please, help me understand.' Every time you mirror someone, they will reword what they’ve said. ""The book's title reflects the author's position that compromise, or ""Splitting the Difference"" is actually a lazy way to conclude a negotiation. It often gives bad results: ""We don’t compromise because it’s right; we compromise because it is easy and because it saves face."" However, a simple compromise is often ""ineffective and often disastrous. At best, it satisfies neither side. And if you employ it with a counterpart who has a win-lose approach, you’re setting yourself up to be swindled."" Instead of taking the easy way, Chris recommends working relentlessly to see ""what is really motivating the other side."" The negotiation is not so much a battle, as a process of ""Discovery."" Figure out as much as you can about what the other sides really needs. Even when the other side says, ""No,"" that's okay. Use that to clarify what the parties really want. Figure out the other side’s “religion,"" or what truly matters to them.Finally, the Appendix contains detailed steps for preparing for an important negotiation. For instnace, list your goals, as well as the negotiating ""tools"" you will be using. Chris explains that in the heat of discussion, you will otherwise forget your tactics. All in all, I found NEVER SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE to be an impressive book, filled with practical knowledge, tips, and just plain WISDOM about how to deal with people. I like the fact that the tips and tactics are PROVEN techniques--not just some theoretical ideas. If you've negotiated with kidnappers, I'm pretty sure that qualifies you as an experienced negotiator.Advance copy for review courtesy of Edelweiss Book Distributors.  "
27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63950567-jk,Rating 1 out of 5,"This review will focus on 3 areas: The lack of evidence provided to support the efficacy of his claims, the manipulative nature of his tricks, and that many of the tricks seem to be just emulating ""acting in good faith"" but with extra manipulative steps.1. Anecdotes vs Proof: Voss breaks down the book into ten chapters. Each chapter is a trick he explores. Almost every chapter begins with a self-aggrandizing anecdote, and this is really all he gives us to believe that his techniques work. He doesn't mention the times he used them and they didn't work (he does mention mission failure once, but even then it was someone else's fault), nor does he provide us with any sort of studies he has run to prove his efficacy. Additionally, no alternatives to his methods are explored, and no analysis given to the benefits or detriments of using the tricks. Now, someone may easily retort that there are actually 19 footnotes in the book. That is true, but the footnotes generally regard tangential material, and nothing directly related to the tricks he is trying to sell.So regarding the content, if you were to eliminate all anecdotes from the book it may boil down to a nice trifold brochure for his business services.2. Manipulation: If you were to filter Goodreads by lower starred reviews, you'll find the majority of them focus on manipulation. Instead of reinforcing their arguments that manipulation is bad, I just perused the index and listed some terms that I think would be more shocking if they could be rationalized as not manipulative by just their name alone:1. Bending Reality - p. 1392. Assertive Bargaining Style (threats without anger and strategic umbrage) - p. 2023. Forced Empathy - p. 1684. Intentionally mislabeling, reason for - p. 91, 945. Getting your counterparts to bid against themselves p. 181-1856. Wimp-win (yes, this is his term for win-win/ non-zero-sum solutions) p. 240, 242, 253Voss does address the possibility that what he is teaching may be manipulative. ""But many people shy away from them because they seem manipulative... In response, let me just say that these tools are used by all the best negotiators because they simply recognize the human psyche as it is... Using that knowledge is only well, rational."" (Key Lessons - Chapter 6 [120 of 236 on my Nook]). I find it humorous that he acknowledges the complaint, and then never actually addresses whether or not it is manipulative.3. Point # 2 was about manipulation. But to elaborate further, it seems like these tricks aren't just manipulation, but are imitations of someone acting in good faith. It seems that if someone were to replace a formula to manipulate their partner into submission, they may be equally as well off just not being an egocentric asshole. And that takes a lot fewer than 10 chapters of tricks to explain."

They are written for most everyone else who are able to appreciate and execute the suggestions given from these books without finding themselves doing a few dramatic eye rolls. And so...My son told me about a book he read saying ""it really works"" if I could possibly give it a chance by applying the information correctly. I, as he knows am a selective skeptic; so we decided on an experiment. People skills.My son to asked me make a reservation and suggested I call a very popular restaurant to see if I could get an outdoor reservation at 7:15- 7:30 for six people two days from now.  With the many requests I asked, of course there was nothing available. One second later with not enough time for a cancellation to happen, he called them right back from my phone, using a voice and temperament I never knew he had.. He proceeded to engage in a long conversation, while getting the reservation I was refused. A fluke- probably, but I would never bash a book which may be someone else's bible.

This is not a book to help you negotiate any sort of interpersonal relationship, but how to get your way no matter what. Just not my sort of Negotiating. It also really does seem to apply to the life-or-death negotiations, and would not be applicable to tough negotiating situations such as, say, buying a used car. This is where you want to absolutely control a person and mind-fuck them.Yes, I know we say we want to mind-fuck car salesmen, but I mean this is a book about true manipulation of people, not negotiation. It is a book for sociopaths to perfect their game. I am not saying that as a joke. It is probably very popular in prison. It's a book for selfish people.Conversely, if you should ever find yourself in a life-or-death situation, or where you would need total control over someone without them knowing it, it is undoubtedly invaluable. The writer is an FBI negotiator, so doubtless he used these techniques to save a lot of (and probably kill a few) people. "
30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55678885-jeff,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is by far the best book on negotiation I've ever read and newly entered into my top reads list. Never split the difference takes conventional thinking that negotiating is logical, is about ""getting to yes"" and ""splitting the difference"" to get achieve a ""win-win"" situation, then flips that thinking on it's head. The author frames negotiation as two parties working collaborating where the situation is the adversary - what a great way to approach a negotiation. The author stresses the importance of genuine empathy in a negotiation. As a consumer, father and professional salesperson, this book is invaluable. My key takeaways:-When disagreeing with someone's point of view, say ""sorry: repeat back to them what they said in a radio voice and then they should be able to give you some additional clarity. If more clarity is needed, repeat-Use labeling to disarm someone and generate trust during a disagreement, for example: ""it looks as though you want to do the following"" ""it looks as though you feel the following way"" -Accusation audit (a form of anchoring): say upfront the worst case scenario / harshly self-critique for example I'm going to sound like an a****** and then say the statement, they will be more sympathetic and less likely to think you are an a****** as a result-Don't be afraid of no. No is the start of a negotiation it makes people feel calm and in control so give them the chance to do so. Allow them to respond to no and work towards getting the ""that's right"" you seek-Empathy doesn't mean you necessarily agree with the other person it means you're trying to understand their point of view-Asking questions you know will result in a no answer are very productive for example ask ""what will you say no to today?""-To get a response when someone is ignoring your emails ask them ""have you given up on this project?""-A summary is labeling and paraphrasing-Successful negotiations result in getting to ""that's right"" not to ""you're right"". It's about correctly understanding the other person's point of view and situation -Contrary to popular belief you get a better deal when both parties know your deadline-We are all irrational and we are all emotional-Use calibrated questions to collect information that start with what and how never use why which is accusatory-Repeatedly asking calibrated open how questions is a way to say no without making others feel like they've lost control-The objective is not to get others to say ""yes"" it's to get them to say ""that's right"" keep asking calibrated questions until they say ""that's right""-To understand who all the decision-makers are, ask open questions like ""how does this affect the rest of the team?"" ""who else will be affected by this?"" ""how do others feel about this?""-To avoid getting a false yes, have them say yes three times in three different ways using calibrated questions-Using your first name humanizes the discussion. Funny example I'm going to try for getting a discount at a store by saying ""hi my name is Jeff what's the Jeff discount""-There are four ways to say no: ask ""how can I do that""; ""your offer is very generous but I just cannot do that""'; gently say no (need to re-listen to remember the 4th)-A bargaining technique is to offer 65% of what you willing to pay (extreme anchor) then 85 then 95 then 100 and make sure to emphasize along the way-At every negotiation there should be three black swans: a piece of information that is previously unknown and instrumental to the negotiation-To uncover black swans in a meeting have a second person join you both of you take notes compare notes afterwards and also look between the lines-Uncover the other person's unobtained goals and charter a plan for them to achieve them-the audiobook referred to a negotiation preparation checklist, but I can't find it"

Sadly I can't prove that it was awarded because I used a precise number...Original text:Fun short book from a former hostage negotiation expert turned business consultant. It's a bunch of techniques to use empathy and a few psychological tricks to understand what the other person in any conflict actually wants, and to steer the negotiation to where you want it to go. He calls his techniques ""tactical listening"" - I'm imagining buff guys with knee protectors, Kevlar vests and helmets all sitting down for a nice cup of tea, but sadly it's nothing like that, it's more about the weird quirks human brains exhibit (think Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow, which is quoted a few times), and how to use those quirks together with good and attentive listening to your advantage. It's all very much about emotions, very little Homo economicus. Don't avoid conflicts, but embrace them. Try to find ""black swans"" (unknown unknowns, in this case unknown information about your negotiation partners) and use them, they're powerful. Make your ""opponent"" say ""No"" so you at least know where the boundaries are, work from there (I wish I could do that with science funding agencies).But: What happens if you have two guys who have to negotiate with each other, but who've read similar books on the art of negotiation?

Maybe because the author isn't just some self proclaimed guru or know-it-all, but comes from a long career of doing what he's teaching. Maybe it's because negotiations are so common and at the same time, important. The stories in this book were a ton of fun and helped make this book more enjoyable than a typical textbook-style read. They also served the purpose of being examples of how various techniques work and what pitfalls you can run into. I have already changed the way I interact with others trying to cater my words to how the author suggests I phrase things. It's a lot harder than the easy to understand concepts, but I feel with time and practice it'll get better. So why a 5 star review? I have yet to see these lessons benefit me, but I did notice that they take the edge off stressful conversations. I have no doubt that the removal of negative feelings will eventually yield positive results. This book was such a quick read that it makes the perfect book to revisit over and over again to master and also to refresh oneself. The author avoided using filler to boost his page count.

Needed a blueprint for negotiation definitely holds up on that end. So much information looking back again, gradually implementing it day to day. Definitely not a one time read and something that compounds in value overtime. Think spent more time on 2nd read through to really imbibe it. I loved this line:""When the pressure is on, you don't rise to the occasion - you fall to your highest level of preparation.""Job interview, confrontations in relationships or business negotiations, can use these strategies to subtly guide counterpart to solve your problems while thinking their idea. Something everyone could use."

Credeam că vor fi sfaturi pentru sfera business mai mult, și deși o parte din carte vorbește și despre încheierea unor contracte avantajoase, mare parte din ea este pur și simplu despre interacțiunea umană. Mi-a plăcut mult de tot cum Chris Voss abordează fiecare situație tensionată, indiferent că e vorba de negocierea de ostatici sau obținerea unor reduceri masive, pentru simplul motiv că pune la bază empatia și capacitatea de a te pune în locul celeilalte persoane. Indiferent că această persoană este un răufăcător sau nu. Până la urmă, toți suntem oameni, toți avem dorințe, și scopul unei negocieri este să împiedice lucruri rele să se întâmple. Simt că am învățat multe de pe urma acestei cărți și o recomand cu tărie tuturor celor care vor să-și îmbunătățească abilitățile de socializare sau chiar de obținere de informații sau negociere a unui salariu sau a unui preț.

However I didn´t really learn so much, had I read it a year ago then I would get a lot more out of it. A lot of negotiations strategies he describes are part of communication in my nursing education. Types of negotiations he describes, mirroring, using non-verbal communications such as silence, reformulating, repetition, its all part of how we learn to communicate with patiens. I still definitely recommend reading this one, its perfect to learn how to manipulate a conversation to your advantage and realizing how other people do/try to do it to you. "

46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1369203-tim,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is an excellent book. I was surprised I liked it as much as I did. I’m not particularly interested in negotiation.Even if you are not interested in improving your negotiation skills, you may have a curious interest in psychology and communication, and the book is very insightful on these topics. And the book may be more applicable to you than you think, since the author’s definition of “negotiation” is quite broad, where it likely will be applicable to some aspects of your lives.My favorite insight: ask “how” questions. If you are in discussions with someone who is emotional and making irrational demands, a great technique is to ask them “how” questions. The kidnapper says “Give me a million dollars or your son dies” and you say “How am I supposed to do that? How do I even know he’s alive?”. It gets your interlocutor to think more logically and less emotionally. If done right it doesn’t feel accusatory (unlike “why” questions, which almost always feel accusatory) and fosters a spirit of collaboration. And it subtly puts the onus on the other person to defend their position. I was convinced by the various stories that this is a great technique, and I don’t think it is only applicable in extreme scenarios like dealing with hostage situations.My second favorite insight: mirroring. If you want to get more information from somebody, literally just repeat some key words back to them that they just said. This may sound ridiculous. But I think it works. People will instinctively want to say more, but they are not going to just repeat the exact same words, so they will typically find other words to describe what they just said. In a negotiation context, you might learn some valuable information that you can put to your advantage. Although, I was more interested in this as a conversational trick, where sometimes you might want to learn something more about something someone just said, but you are having trouble finding the right way to ask. The author calls this the nearest thing you’ll find in the book to a “jedi mind trick”. It seems pretty nifty.The last couple chapters weren’t as good, as the “tricks” sometimes stopped being as interesting or believable. But overall, there was enough great stuff in here to be a 5 star read, one I’ll probably want to read again some time."

Puedo ver que el libro es tan de culto, que he detectado en vendedores y en mucha gente que están utilizando al pie de la letra las tácticas mencionadas en él. Me atrevería a decir que este libro debe ser lectura esencial para cualquier persona que quiera buscar trabajo, se dedique a compra venta de cosas o incluso para padres de familia que están empezando a tener conversaciones ""racionales"" con sus hijos.

48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24371838-arushi-kalra,Rating 2 out of 5,"Chris Voss with his years of experience as FBI's hostage negotiator has put together some useful tips and tricks in this book to help us embrace negotiation as an important part of our lives. He says that negotiation is the heart of collaboration and even though it can make us uncomfortable at times, this conflict can potentially be meaningful and productive for all parties involved. Voss draws parallels between his high stake hostage negotiations and every day business and personal negotiations (""after all, kidnappers are just businessmen trying to get the best price""). Through these anecdotes he teaches techniques such as mirroring, labeling, accusation audit, uncovering the black swan etc. At the end of the book, there is a practical guide for creating a one sheeter that will help you employ all of these techniques and be well prepared for a negotiation. The idea that he tries to bring home is that negotiation is basically emotional intelligence on steroids and empathy is the key to a successful negotiation. Always think of the situation as the adversary and not your counterpart. And never settle for a compromise by ""splitting the difference"" as that can lead to terrible outcomes. My 2 cents on the book: While the techniques shared were interesting, Voss couldn't hold my interest in the book. I probably could have just heard his Masterclass or read a summary and learnt all of this in a much shorter duration. I will however give this book another star if I'm ever able to successfully employ any of the techniques taught here in a real life negotiation ;)"

My favorite part from the book was Chapter 9, when he shares the story with the car salesmen and the Red Toyota 4Runner.For those that are in sales, this is a must read. My reason for 4 stars, is that I did find some of the chapters monotonous and long-winded.UPDATE: After reverting back to the book many time since reading it, I’ve grown to find more and more value from it that has been impactful.

Well in a word yes.... and I know that manipulation is often personified as something that is so bad to do. However, I think this kind of manipulation has a positive benefit for both sides as it teaches you to meet in the middle in a way that is not so completely out of your favor (as I generally tend to do) Basically I never thought I would be recommending a book like this but give it a chance its fascinating.

58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose-on-hiatus,Rating 4 out of 5,"Truth to be told, I am a terrible negotiator. In fact, according to Chris Voss, natural-born excellent negotiators are rare and many established business school negotiation training courses are not as affective as they claim. This book is a mix of negotiating principles and the real life applications from the author's career first at FBI crisis response unit then at his own business training company (https://www.blackswanltd.com). Chris Voss writes convincingly. Each principle is explained clearly with real life examples. Each chapter ends with a summary. The author is not educated in psychology, but his methods are psychologically sound. His argument is that humans are not always rational--in fact, we are emotional and irrational especially in a conflict (and life is full of big and small conflicts). It echos what Daniel Kahneman (Thinking, Fast and Slow) and Amos Tversky discovered in Behavior Economics. The last chapter is about discovering the black swans (the unknown unknowns that could make a big impact on the negotiation). Nassim Taleb(The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable) is mentioned in this chapter.I find the book extremely useful. If you are too aggressive and angry therefore facing too much pushbacks, or too passive and not assertive enough therefore never pushing forward far, or too fearful, too nervous when dealing with a conflict, or, simply just feeling undervalued by your boss, this is the book for you.A lot useful tips, such as: how to be a good listener; how to ask open-ended, calibrated question; how mirroring your counterpart and why mirroring works; label the counterpart's emotions; question framing; why framing your question to get a ""no"" answer is better than ""yes"" answer; how to get ""that's right"" than ""you are right""; create the illusion of control for your counterpart; a deal without how is not a deal; find non monetary terms cheap to you but valuable to others; use odd numbers; aim high; understand your and your counterpart's negotiating type, and use the information accordingly, etc....Don't avoid honest, clear conflict--it will get you the best price, higher salary and largest donation; it will save your marriage, your friendship and family. One can only be an exceptional negotiator and great person by both listening and speaking clearly and empathetically, by treating counterpart and oneself with dignity and respect, and most of all, be honest about what one wants and what one can and can not do.

It's not overly verbose and tends to get straight to the point.The best thing about this book is it teaches basic communication skills, in the form of negotiation strategies. I feel majority of the people would benefit greatly, and so would humanity as a whole, if they embraced the advice given in this book. Roughly speaking, Chris Voss says that if you listen actively to what your counterpart has to say, and you approach every situation with more empathy, and make it less about yourself, you can achieve high levels of collaboration and efficiency, and end up achieving your own goals more consistently. He describes few very specific strategies and gives a lot of examples, which are quite amusing, as they capture the essence of how irrational human beings are, and how one can potentially use that for achieving better results in almost anything that involves human interactions."

Mi-am dat seama de felul în care oamenii din jurul meu reușesc să obțină ceea ce vor, metodele prin care reușesc să câștige.Sinceră să fiu nu știam de existența multora din ele, unele m-au surprins total.La finalul fiecărui capitol avem LECȚIILE CHEIE.Sunt tare recunoscătoare și pentru ele, de fiecare dată când vreau să-mi reactualizez informațiile le voi reciti și îmi voi aminti despre ce era vorba în acel capitol.Sunt un fel de idei principale, care surprind exact pașii importanți.Deci îmi place tare mult structura cărții, din punctul meu de vedere e structura perfectă pentru o carte de dezvoltare personală. Un alt motiv pentru care îmi place este faptul că nu conține vorbe goale, toate sfaturile sunt reale și pot să le pun în practică fără dificultăți.Sunt pentru toți oamenii!Nu trebuie să lucrezi într-un mediu în care trebuie să negociezi , negocierea este prezentă în fiecare zi în viețile noastre.Eu cred că o astfel de carte ne lărgește orizontul și ne învat�� o mulțime de lucruri.O recomand cu drag!E cea mai bună carte de non-ficțiune de până acum la egalitate cu Înțelepciunea psihopaților , de asemenea de la editura Globo."
68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55163554-emre-sevin,Rating 4 out of 5,"My first thought when I came across this title was: ""Probably yet another ordinary 'business' book that promises the world, tries to build a nice-sounding, feel-good narrative, forcing to drive its message home by selecting a few studies from psychology research.""I'm very happy to have been wrong. Not only is the book very exciting to read, but it also doesn't promise magic. The author, in his own words, isn't someone extraordinary or a business genius: he started his career as a hard-working police officer, went on to be an FBI agent, and climbed up the FBI ladder to be a negotiator. His war stories, both from local incidents, to high profile international ransom cases sets the scene very well. But what about applying the negotiation principles that worked in such criminal circumstances to everyday cases that most of the people encounter? Would they work well in a business setting? Would they work in ordinary, but still critical interpersonal relationships? How about negotiating with your children? What about negotiating with a car salesman? Is it even possible to get a rent decrease, when your landlord announced an increase in rent, declaring that this is the final word?The distillation of principles, rules, and heuristics, based on field-tested methods and ample psychological research makes this book a very valuable and practical read. That doesn't mean you can immediately start applying the rules laid out by the author: some of the things will lead to extreme psychological resistance, and I'm sure you'll need serious preparation and deliberate practice; you should also be ready to fail (but at least be aware why exactly you did, if you do). Just like he described, many of us don't like conflict, and will try to stay away from it, even if that means a bad deal. But the message of the book is crystal clear: No deal is better than a bad deal. I had my share of business meetings and various negotiation war stories (yes, even engineers have to negotiate for a lot of things, whether they realize that or not not), and from now on, it'll be impossible for me to view such interactions without remembering the key points of that book."
69,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5209593-saurabh-modi,Rating 5 out of 5,"I listened to the audio book. I felt that this book could be immensely valuable if the lessons are applied to day to day life. I can already find myself trying to observe the many nuances the author talks about. More than the specific `what to do` or `how to do` within negotiation type situations, the author also instructs a reader about what could be a potential framework to negotiate and how to tweak that framework for your specific personality types/needs. Said differently, it does not limit its usefulness to the tactics it mentions, rather, like a mathematical book, you can build on the concepts laid out here, beyond what the author directly wrote. The ceiling is one the reader has/creates. A part which may detract some people from reading/listening to this book is that the author seems a bit too self assured sometimes, to the point of seeming arrogant sometimes. It's probably justified given the difficult situations he has dealt with over his long, eventful career. To be honest, seeming arrogant is probably irrelevant if the message the author is trying to convey sent home, at the end of the day.I think that this is a book where you probably want to take extensive notes and try executing the strategies in day to day conversations. Notice the conflicts, observe your mistakes, try the tactics and improvise. So far I've read it once, but I plan to read it a couple of times to really get the lesson."

Erg interessant en leuk verteld boek over onderhandelingen. Met verrassende inzichten, voor mij althans, zoals dat die hele 'laat mensen meteen ja zeggen, dan zijn ze in een ja-bui' onzin blijkt te zijn. Juist een 'Nee' biedt veiligheid om van daaruit naar de ja te gaan zoeken. En over de manieren waarop je empathie kan opbouwen, en de gedachten van de tegenpartij kan veranderen. Lees dit boek als je ooit onderhandelt. Of wel eens offertes maakt of krijgt. Echt. "

Here, he doles out explicit, thought provoking information, tactics and encouragement on how to influence others. Given his life experience, he certainly knows what he’s talking about.

You will not close this book without learning something essential."

Funny enough, when I listened to it for the first time, it gave me some ideas about negotiation, then I had a negotiation and felt great.

74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48493963-suad-alhalwachi,Rating 5 out of 5,"A full on five stars for a brief book that makes you want to rewind your life so you can do the suggestions mentioned in all your endeavors. Of course there are lots of repetitive thoughts in the book but I felt at the end that they were necessary to hone in to the ideas. I precisely loved the concept of black swan. It’s the unknown unknown that we all need to look for in any situation. In fact it’s the first thing that we need to look for in any negotiation. The example about the real estate Dialogue between the student and the real estate agent was a great one. Finding the reason for the sale gives you an edge. I should have known that when I bought my various houses. Pity Also many years ago someone suggested that I must read a book called “fooled by randomness” by Nassim Taleb. It’s referred in this book so guess what’s my next book is going to be. Excerpts:“Then at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, eleven Israeli athletes and coaches were killed by their Palestinian captors after a botched rescue attempt by the German police.”“Kahneman later codified his research in the 2011 bestseller Thinking, Fast and Slow.3 Man, he wrote, has two systems of thought: System 1, our animal mind, is fast, instinctive, and emotional; System 2 is slow, deliberative, and logical. And System 1 is far more “influential. In fact, it guides and steers our rational thoughts.”“Happily, very few people are ever forced to deal with Islamist terrorists who’ve kidnapped their loved ones.”“We are easily distracted. We engage in selective listening, hearing only what we want to hear, our minds acting on a cognitive bias for consistency rather than truth. And that’s just the start.Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by the arguments that support their position that they are unable to listen attentively. In one of the most cited research papers in psychology,1 George A. Miller persuasively put forth the idea that we can process only about seven pieces of information in our conscious mind at any given moment.”“instead of doing any thinking at all in the early goings about what you’re going to say—make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. In that mode of true active listening—aided by the tactics you’ll learn in the following chapters—you’ll disarm your counterpart. You’ll make them feel safe. The voice in their head will begin to quiet down.”“That’s why your most powerful tool in any verbal communication is your voice. You can use your voice to intentionally reach into someone’s brain and flip an emotional switch. Distrusting to trusting. Nervous to calm. In an instant, the switch will flip just like that with the right delivery.”“   The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to make a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow. When done properly, you create an aura of authority and trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness.”“And when I make a mistake—something that happens a lot—I always acknowledge the other person’s anger. I’ve found the phrase “Look, I’m an asshole” to be an amazingly effective way to make problems go away.That approach has never failed me.”“Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging it”“In a study of the components of lying,2 Harvard Business School professor Deepak Malhotra and his coauthors found that, on average, liars use more words than truth tellers and use far more third-person pronouns. They start talking about him, her, it, one, they, and their rather than I, in order to put some distance between themselves and the lie.And they discovered that liars tend to speak in more complex sentences in an attempt to win over their suspicious counterparts. It’s what W. C. Fields meant when he talked about baffling someone with bullshit. The researchers dubbed this the Pinocchio Effect because, just like Pinocchio’s nose, the number of words grew along with the lie. People who are lying are, understandably, more worried about being believed, so they work harder—too hard, as it were—at being believable.”“    Prepare an Ackerman plan. Before you head into the weeds of bargaining, you’ll need a plan of extreme anchor, calibrated questions, and well-defined offers. Remember: 65, 85, 95, 100 percent. Decreasing raises and ending on nonround numbers will get your counterpart to believe that he’s squeezing you for all you’re worth when you’re really getting to the number you want.”“The world didn’t tell Steve Jobs that it wanted an iPad: he uncovered our need, that Black Swan, without us knowing the information was there.”“Every engineer, every executive, every child—all of us want to believe we are capable of the extraordinary. As children, our daydreams feature ourselves as primary players in great moments: an actor winning an Oscar, an athlete hitting the game-winning shot. As we grow older, however, our parents, teachers, and friends talk more of what we can’t and shouldn’t do than what is possible. We begin to lose faith.”“With the style of negotiation taught in the book—an information-obsessed, empathic search for the best possible deal—you are trying to uncover value, period. Not to strong-arm or to humiliate. “With the style of negotiation taught in the book—an information-obsessed, empathic search for the best possible deal—you are trying to uncover value, period.

I would reccomend it to anyone, 100%. Don't trust the reviews saying 'It's just using people' or better yet, 'It's bringing women down'. Y'all are clowns that have to put your own beliefs and problems over anything you consume.If you want to, read it and I guarantee, you will benefit from this, there's something here for everyone. And I feel like it's needed now more than ever, since we've all become so bad at communicating and solving problems.""One can only be an exceptional negotiator, and a great person, by both listening and speaking clearly and empathetically; by treating counterparts—and oneself—with dignity and respect; and most of all by being honest about what one wants and what one can—and cannot—do.

There are many detailed examples that show how to apply the principles in real life, but are longer than necessary. The lessons come from Voss' 24 years in the FBI (he was the lead international kidnapping negotiator) and 10 years of teaching and consulting in business schools and corporations.Voss says his approach is better than Getting to Yes because people can say yes without truly agreeing or committing.I read this to be better at negotiating in business and in daily life.NotesThe New RulesRespond to demands by asking open-ended questions over and over until counterpart (person you're negotiating with) gives up.Tactical empathy: ""listening as a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional intelligence and the assertive skills of influence, to gain access to the mind of another person."" When people feel listened to, they listen to themselves more carefully, and openly evaluate and clarify their thoughts and feelings.Be a MirrorIdentify what your counterpart needs (monetarily, emotionally, etc.) and get them to feel safe talking about what they want. Latter helps you discover former.Negotiate slowly; hurrying your counterpart undermines rapport and trust.Most of the time, use a positive/playful voice; and easy-going, good-natured voice that's light and encouraging. Relax and smile while talking.When a positive/playful voice isn't right approach, use downward inflection, speaking slowly and clearly, sounding confident yet friendly. Make straightforward declarations that don't invite responses.Mirror your counterpart's words; repeat their last three words, which forms a connection.How to disagree without being disagreeable1. Speak in a calm, confident, friendly voice, with downward inflection.2. Respond to counterpart's request with ""I'm sorry,"" and then repeat the request in an inquisitive tone.3. Be silent for at least four seconds.4. Repeat.Use tactical empathy. Understand your counterpart. Learn their position, why their actions make sense to them, and what might move them.Label: calmly and respectfully repeated counterpart's emotions back to them, to show you identify with how they feel.After labeling counterpart's emotions, be silent so they'll respond.When dealing with negative situation or person, observe negativity without reaction or judgment. Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate, solution-based thoughts.List of the worst things your counterpart could say about you before they get the chance. Saying them out loud can make them sound exaggerated to counterpart.Beware ""Yes""—Master ""No""Invite counterpart to say no (decline your request) to bring down barriers and ease communication.When counterpart says, ""no,"" pause, then ask solution-based question, or label their effect (e.g., ""What about this doesn't work for you?"" ""What would you need to make it work?"" ""It seems like there's something here that bothers you."").When prospect won't reply to your emails, send, ""Have you given up on this project?""Trigger the Two Words that Immediately Transform Any NegotiationYour goal isn't to get a counterpart to say ""yes,"" but to say, ""that's right"" (not ""you're right""). To get there, summarize what your counterpart said and acknowledge (label) their emotions.Bend Their RealityDon't compromise. ""No deal is better than a bad deal.""Deadlines are usually arbitrary, and rarely have negative consequences.When you give counterpart a deadline, you're likely to get a better deal, and faster.When you're accused of being unfair, say, ""Let's stop everything and go back to where you feel I started treating you unfairly and fix it.""Early in negotiation, say, ""I want you to feel fairly treated at all times, so please stop me if you feel I'm being unfair.""When negotiating price, let counterpart make first offer, or give a ballpark range of prices you would like.Create the Illusion of ControlTo get a more favorable offer, ask, ""How am I supposed to do that?""Calibrated questionsAsk these in a tone that sounds like a request for assistance.• What about this is important to you?• How can I help to make this better for us?• How would you like me to proceed?• What is it that brought us into this situation?• How can we solve this problem?• What's the objective?

Set your target price (your goal).2. Set your first offer at 65% of your target price.3. Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, 100%).4. Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying ""no"" to get counterpart to counter before you increase your offer.5.

80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,Rating 4 out of 5,"""Negotiation is the heart of collaboration. It is what makes conflict potentially meaningful and productive for all parties. It can change your life, as it has changed mine...""Never Split the Difference was an interesting look into the topic.Author Chris Voss is a 24-year veteran of the FBI and one of the preeminent practitioners and professors of negotiating skills in the world. He is the founder and principal of The Black Swan Group, a consulting firm that provides training and advises Fortune 500 companies through complex negotiations. Voss has taught for many business schools, including the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, Harvard University, MIT's Sloan School of Management, and Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, among others.
Chris Voss:


Voss opens the books with a good intro; setting the pace for the rest of the writing to follow. He's got a great natural engaging style that should have no trouble holding the reader's attention.The formatting of the book is also very well done. It is broken into well-defined chapters, and each chapter into blurbs of writing with relevant headers at the top. At the end of every chapter, he summarizes the highlights with bullet point notes. I like books that are formatted in this manner, as I feel that it is the optimal way for the reader to retain the information presented.The writing in the book proper begins with a brief and amusing history of law enforcement ""negotiation"" with criminals holding hostages. Basically, they used to just storm in and shoot it out, says Voss.He drops this quote about the aim of the book:
""Negotiation as you’ll learn it here is nothing more than communication with results. Getting what you want out of life is all about getting what you want from—and with— other people. Conflict between two parties is inevitable in all relationships. So it’s useful—crucial, even—to know how to engage in that conflict to get what you want without inflicting damage.In this book, I draw on my more than two-decade career in the Federal Bureau of Investigation to distill the principles and practices I deployed in the field into an exciting new approach designed to help you disarm, redirect, and dismantle your counterpart in virtually any negotiation. And to do so in a relationship-affirming way.Yes, you’ll learn how we negotiated the safe release of countless hostages. But you’ll also learn how to use a deep understanding of human psychology to negotiate a lower car price, a bigger raise, and a child’s bedtime. This book will teach you to reclaim control of the conversations that inform your life and career.""
Although most of the writing and content was good here, many of the case studies examined are likely outliers, and not typical examples of negotiations. Voss shares many anecdotal stories from his career to exemplify the processes he uses. Unfortunately, I am not just not sure how often these strategies will work in most real-world applications. Negotiations on the price of something, for example. More often than not, the flexibility on the price of something is mostly determined by how in demand that thing is. If it's a seller's market, the seller likely knows this, and will be reluctant to lower their price. All the verbal judo in the world is not likely to put you in a better position if someone is very firm on their price. I guess there's no harm in trying, in any case. At least then you'll know that you did your best...To his credit, Voss does examine this dynamic in chapter 10 of the book, where he talks about leverage: what it is, who has it, and how to use it.***********************Never Split the Difference was well done. I would recommend it to anyone interested.4.5 stars."

84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58564192-dev-sathe,Rating 2 out of 5,"This review is specifically for someone who has done a negotiations course before (e.g. in business school).I felt most of his tactics were new names and labels for the same bag of tricks. I’ve broken down these techniques into three sections: i) Covered in business school curriculum and the book ii) Covered in the book only iii) Covered in business school curriculum only. I wasn’t a fan of the tone of the book as well.1. Covered in business school curriculum and “Never split a difference” booka) Listen & empathizeIn Chapter 1 “The New Rules”, Chapter 2 “Be a Mirror”, Chapter 3 “Labels”, Chapter 5 “That’s Right”, the book emphasizes active listening and empathizing through mirroring, repeating labels. b) Prepare, prepare, prepare with the goal of uncovering as much information as possibleChapter 10 “Finding the black swan” in your counterpart. Understand (and research) what they will have to lose if negotiations collapse and remind them during the negotiation.c) Relationship based on trustIn Chapter 8 “Guaranteeing Execution” the “Pinnochio effect” and “Chris-discount” focus on building trust. Concessions also build trust as you work towards a solution (but start rolling out the concessions slowly).2. Covered in “Never split the difference” book only (i.e. new content)a) Power of silence. Interesting use of silence tob) Getting to “No”. “No” should be read as “Wait” or “I’m not comfortable with that…”. Being pushed for a “yes” makes people defensive. No is the start of the negotiation, not the end of it. “No” provides a great opportunity for you and the other party to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don’t want. If you’re trying to sell something, don’t start with “Do you have a few minutes to talk?” Instead ask, “Is now a bad time to talk?”c) The 7–38–55 Percent Rule. 7% of a message is based on the words, while 38% comes from the tone of voice and 55% comes from the speaker’s body language and face. This applies to both delivering a message as well as observing your counterpart and getting a conversation back on track if its going off the rails (e.g. using labels, mirroring).d) The Rule of Three. Get your counterpart to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation. After the first time they “agree”, summarize the discussion and wait for a “That’s right” to get to the second “agree”. For the third, ask them “how” or “what” to get them to discuss the implementation and/or success metrics.e) Ackerman model. This is a useful rule of thumb for setting the high range of the ZOPA (zone of possible agreements). Anchor the first price at 65% of the target price then go to increments of 85%, 95% and finally 100%. When getting to the final price, use a non-round number like $483 instead of $480 as it adds credibility and weight. At the final number, throw in a non-monetary item to show that you’re at your limit.f) Create the illusion of control. Ask calibrated questions such as “How am I supposed to do that?” to focus the counterpart on the problem rather than a conflict. Other ones are: “What is the biggest challenge you face”, “What about this is important to you?”, “How can I help to make this better for us?”, “How would you like me to proceed?”. Regulate your emotions if the conversations flare up.3. Covered in business school curriculum but not the booka) The idea of BATNA (& ZOPA) was briefly mentioned but the author was against it as he felt it anchored people on the BATNA number during negotiations. Even if that is the case, understanding the ZOPA is important as you prepare the negotiation. The Ackerman model (mentioned in 2e above) can be used to build the upper bound of the ZOPA.b) Post settlement settlement. Most negotiations never actually end as there are more opportunities in the future to push for a better deal. Use meeting notes as a powerful way to carry forward some topics to open up further negotiation areas / topics that can benefit you. Be kind, warm as you close a negotiation for future rounds.c) Before the negotiation, try to establish rapport and a coalition to have support during negotiation that includes multiple parties.d) Give the first offer unless you have lesser information than your counterpart (e.g. employment process). The book advocates for waiting to get an offer and then offering a range."

87,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6645592-mark-seemann,Rating 3 out of 5,"As negotiators, we're often prone to compromise; to meet in the middle between the buyer's desired low price and the seller's preferred high price.If you're negotiating with hostage takers and kidnappers, meeting in the middle isn't a good result. Do you accept that a hostage taker kills half of his hostages? That's not a good deal for anyone.Hostage negotiator Chris Voss has lots of insights into how to negotiate without compromising - without splitting the difference.There's many tricks to learn, but while, as is usual with American self-help books, you're presented with a system, I'm doubtful as to how much of a system there actually is, and how much of it is pure skill and hard work, combined with a bit of talent.Voss is, obviously, a good negotiator. Given that he's a professional negotiator, you'd be surprised if he was anything else. Will the book turn a casual negotiator into a great negotiator? I have my doubts, but I'll see if I can use some of the tricks in the book.It's an easy read, but I think it falls a bit between two chairs. Each chapter comes with at least one hostage negotiation story and is then combined with some general observations about the psychology and technique of negotiation. There's too little real-world action to be a compelling true-crime narrative, and the negotiation theory seems a bit too light to be really useful, but perhaps I'm wrong. Time will tell."

Rovněž jsem si vzpomněl na jiné školení, kde jsme měli „protivníkovi“ odpovídat otázkou (prohrál ten, kdo odpověděl či nevymyslel otázku - tzv. question game), což taky odpovídá jedné zmiňované technice."

Nearly everything I encountered as gospel in business school about negotiating was handily dismissed and countered in this book. I loved that. The author also channeled Kahneman and Taleb and the lessons from those great authors to improve his negotiating techniques. Many conversations throughout the day are mini or large negotiations. This book provides immediately implementable techniques, mindsets, and tools to help in your everyday dealings."

It might not have changed my life though, but it certainly changed my views and attitudes towards negotiations and mundane conversations.

100,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40886340-sawyer-x,Rating 4 out of 5,"There's a lot to appreciate about the book. It analyzes the steps of a negotiation using compelling anecdotes from exciting, real-life negotiation scenarios like hostage-taking. It curates the different negotiating styles and how to deal with them (whether you are versus them or yourself one of them). It provides an arsenal of verbal techniques to move toward your goals in a negotiation.I still have a few qualms about this approach:* It suggests that you should never compromise (as the title says, ""never split the difference"") because you end up lop-sided on both ends for each person. However, in many real-world scenarios (and even those shared in the book), people compromise. In a hostage-taking that included money changing hands - any sum of money is a compromise. I think it might have been better to articulate what ""compromise"" means in this case. When is it ""splitting the difference""?* The book suggests a quite egotistical perspective of negotiation, leading to cut-throat demands of each side. To illustrate this problem, imagine what happens when a company negotiates to hire someone at the absolute lowest salary they can. The employee will often resent the company and eventually leave it when it needs them or does more active damage to the company. (Luckily, many companies understood this problem and offer salaries that at least won't make an employee want to hurt the business and at best would make the employee want to stay.) Such behavior is not just anti-social (and leads to long-term feelings of resentment) but creates a world that makes it challenging to navigate.* The book doesn't cover cases in which negotiations stall. Not compromising on an inch can often break the deal and leave both sides with nothing to show for it. One example in the book of losing is students who refused to sell for a lower price than they thought worthwhile and the author (who taught the course) explained that any offer is money (I don't recall the exact details) which leads to ""if you sell it, you earned. If you don't, you likely lost."" So, what happens when we refuse to give an inch or when we haggle aggressively and the entire deal breaks? Is that a win? What do we do when that happens? When is it acceptable to just walk away?* Lastly, the ""self-correcting"" problem. Imagine driving and looking for a shortcut around a traffic jam. If everyone took the same shortcut on the road navigation app you use, it's no longer a shortcut. So you pick another shortcut, and everyone takes that, and it's no longer a shortcut either. The same can be said for using these techniques: You refuse to give an inch and so does the opponent; you use mirrors, and so do they; you provide an excessively high offer, and they give an exaggerated low offer (which you both refuse to compromise over), etc. What happens when two advocates of these techniques meet each other? The theory is limited to a select few who employ these techniques versus a diminishing number of people who do not. This feels like an incomplete approach.Overall, I highly recommend reading the book, taking notes, and trying them out but also taking much of it with a grain of ""incomplete theory"" salt and ""let's not turn into cut-throat psychopaths"" pepper."

Uit persoonlijke ervaring weet ik dat dit niet het geval is.Veel 'trucjes' om beter uit een onderhandeling te komen kan je ook leren door het gemiddelde zelfontwikkelingsboek te lezen of door de gemiddelde overbodige, maar verplichte zelfontwikkelingsles op school aandachtig bij te wonen. Want het belangrijkste is natuurlijk om écht goed te luisteren naar je medemens om zo hun ware beweegredenen te zien. Het grote verschil van dit boek en die andere zelfhulp boeken is echter dat ze hier worden uitgelegd door middel van verhalen over waargebeurde gijzelingen in plaats van door middel van de welbekende 'we-are-the-world-we-are-the-children-feelgood-meuk' die zelfs de diepste vezels van mijn lichaam zum kotsen vinden. Main takeaways, naast dat luisteren en begrijpen essentieel is natuurlijk:-Een onderhandeling met een 'nee' beginnen is niet persé slecht, omdat het je tegenpartij de indruk kan geven dat hij veilig is en nee mag zeggen-Zeg zelf echter geen nee, maar vraag in plaats daarvan 'hoe' of 'wat' vragen (Hoe zou ik dat kunnen betalen etc.)-Bereid je goed voor (Weet je wat, gebruik deze tip ook maar voor de rest van je leven)-Laat de andere met het eerste bod komen.

102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60022503-narilka,Rating 5 out of 5,"Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, offers a different approach to the art of negotiation in his book Never Split the Difference. Through his experience spanning 20 years Voss has realized that older methods for negotiation, relying more on facts and logic, run counter to human nature and how we, as humans, make decisions. He proposes that we embrace human nature and adopt strategies that feel counterintuitive by taking emotional intelligence, targeted empathy and active listening skills to the next level to become more persuasive in our daily interactions. This was a refreshing point of view and Voss's techniques have many applications to all sorts of interactions between people, not just negotiations.Each chapter starts with a real negotiation scenario from Chris's past, be it hostage situations with lives on the line or a class setting for training, then follows it up with insights into what worked and what didn't during the situation. He even highlights a spectacular failure and why things went as wrong as it did. Each chapter builds upon the previous with pointers on how to use the skills in combination with each other or individually. Each chapter ends with a summary that are great to refer back to. My kindle tells me I highlighted 92 passages I found so many things I want to review and remember. After reading the book I have been working on integrating some of Voss's advice into my every day life. I think it's slowly helping me improve my social skills and daily interactions with others. It's definitely a work in progress. I'll be rereading parts of this book often."

106,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5661444-farrah,Rating 4 out of 5,"First off, the co-author of this book is amazing. Obviously, the author and hostage negotiator has great life experiences and stories to work with, but as a person who spends much of my work time crafting my client's stories into bylines, pitches, etc. I was very impressed with how the writer packed a punch right off the bat at the start of each chapter and crafted the flow and takeaways of each chapter. TBH even though I work and could use his advice in business settings, much of the time, I was reading this book through a parenting lens and it really resonated with me haha! So much of parenting teens is reminiscent of a hostage negotiation situation! There were some really good takeaways. My notes on my favorite parts follow:One the importance of labeling the other person's feelings:""Labels almost always begin with roughly the same words: It seems like . . . It sounds like . . . It looks like . . . Notice we said “It sounds like . . .” and not “I’m hearing that . . .” That’s because the word “I” gets people’s guard up. When you say “I,” it says you’re more interested in yourself than the other person, and it makes you take personal responsibility for the words that follow—and the offense they might cause.""Key phrases to use:""It seems like _________ is valuable to you. It seems like you don’t like _________. It seems like you value __________. It seems like _________ makes it easier. It seems like you’re reluctant to _________.""""Research shows that the best way to deal with negativity is to observe it, without reaction and without judgment.""""Imagine yourself in your counterpart’s situation. The beauty of empathy is that it doesn’t demand that you agree with the other person’s ideas (you may well find them crazy). But by acknowledging the other person’s situation, you immediately convey that you are listening. And once they know that you are listening, they may tell you something that you can use. ■​The reasons why a counterpart will not make an agreement with you are often more powerful than why they will make a deal, so focus first on clearing the barriers to agreement. Denying barriers or negative influences gives them credence; get them into the open. ■​Pause. After you label a barrier or mirror a statement, let it sink in. Don’t worry, the other party will fill the silence. ■​Label your counterpart’s fears to diffuse their power. We all want to talk about the happy stuff, but remember, the faster you interrupt action in your counterpart’s amygdala, the part of the brain that generates fear, the faster you can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust. ■​List the worst things that the other party could say about you and say them before the other person can. Performing an accusation audit in advance prepares you to head off negative dynamics before they take root. And because these accusations often sound exaggerated when said aloud, speaking them will encourage the other person to claim that quite the opposite is true. ■​Remember you’re dealing with a person who wants to be appreciated and understood. So use labels to reinforce and encourage positive perceptions and dynamics.More parenting tips - LOL!""Here are some other great standbys that I use in almost every negotiation, depending on the situation: ■​What about this is important to you? ■​How can I help to make this better for us? ■​How would you like me to proceed? ■​What is it that brought us into this situation? ■​How can we solve this problem?""""The basic issue is that when people feel that they are not in control, they adopt what psychologists call a hostage mentality. That is, in moments of conflict they react to their lack of power by either becoming extremely defensive or lashing out.""""Decades of goal-setting research is clear that people who set specific, challenging, but realistic goals end up getting better deals than those who don’t set goals or simply strive to do their best."""

There is so much information within these pages that I think I'm going to have to buy this book so that way I can go back to it again and again. There is so much useful information on negotiating and it works in almost all aspects of your life. From putting the kids to bed to making a deal with your boss. I did my best to practice a little of it as I was reading and it's crazy how well some of it works even when you aren't well versed in this stuff. It takes human psychology and behavior and mixes it with very simple wordplay and the results are astounding. Everything is laid out in a simple and easy to understand way. And it goes over it again throughout the book to try and help you understand how you can mix and match some of the different negotiating tactics. And it makes it feel like me or anyone can do it. Very simple concepts that are just difficult to master. But if you use it, then you will consistently get better and better. Note on narration. Wow was it weird and hard to get used to at first. It is read by Michael Kramer who does The Wheel of Time series and more recently The Stormlight Archive. And I listened to a lot of both of those series through audio. Listening to him talk about negotiating and not some high fantasy story was very strange at first. But after a couple hours it felt like he was right at home reading this. In fact, I would say his voice is better served doing this kind of narration than high fantasy in my humble opinion."

109,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17653800-annie-b,Rating 2 out of 5,"I DRAGGED through this book. I don't think it was for me, I am too much of an empath for some of these techniques.. a lot of them seem overly manipulative (which I get is the point in high stakes situations to get what you want yaddah yaddah yaddah). Here are some (in the authors words) ""key lessons' I took away from this book that could be useful for some people:1. Listen to what people are actually saying. If someone is telling you something, they are most likely telling you for a reason. Your job is to communicate back to them that you understand what they are saying and if you don't, continue to communicate until you do (this seems like basic human decency, but I feel like in general people are kind of bad at this).2. If you don't understand.. continually ask calibrated, open-ended questions. Asking 'how' questions keeps the person engaged and can also lead them to ponder the situation at hand. 3. If you notice someone using pronouns like ""I,"" ""me,"" and ""my,"" the power in the conversation is not equally distributed. If you are hearing ""we,"" ""they,"" and ""them,"" you are most likely dealing with someone who is keeping their options and mind open. 4. For monetary negotiations (mostly in terms of salary I think), most of the time let the other side anchor and then establish a range.. with the low end of the range being your desired salary (within reason.. obviously). 5. The best way to deal with negativity is to observe it. Don't let your emotions get in the way and give yourself time to respond with a rational reaction and without judgment. Label what you have observed and replace it with compassionate and solution-based thought. ""Don't feel their pain, label it.""This book had good content for the most part, but overall felt unorganized with sporadic tips being thrown at you. Then it just ended without it truly wrapping up? I may refer to it from time to time, but it was hard to get through.. and the hostage negotiation stories bored me to tears.."

At the start of this old Nintendo (NES) game a player had to choose one of four characters. There was a footman, archer, wizard, and thief (I think). Each character had certain features. The footman was slow but strong. The archer was fast but weak and so on. None were perfect and after I died I always thought that if I only had the speed of the archer and strength of the footman. That idea came up while reading Voss's book. There were some sections I recognized as things I do well and some sections where I recognized things I do poorly. Having the 'needs improvement' areas articulated and then actions to do so was very helpful. One quibble was that while Voss is less than positive about the classic Getting to Yes, I think his book and that one have more in common than he acknowledges. I could be missing something, but that was my impression. Re-Reading GTY to see. "
111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/264971-deodand,Rating 3 out of 5,"I read this book for professional insight, and I didn't find new tools. Voss's approach requires a high level of emotional intelligence. This can be learned to a certain extent, but the best negotiators applying these techniques are born, not made. It's easy to get caught ""mirroring"" people, for example, unless you are practiced.Also there is not much advice here for the strict business negotiations where a specific number needs to be achieved. Voss rightly questions this practice, and tries to find a way around it into determining the root cause of a specific requirement, but it doesn't always work that way in the real world. For example, the techniques here may not be useful in a salary negotiation, where there is a strong power imbalance.The stories of high-stakes negotiation are interesting, but the successes seem to be born from good instincts."

Be aware that they won't do any good if you don't have a chance to practice them, as they can be quite specific. Unfortunately suffers from the common non-fiction flaw of trying too hard/spending too much time ""selling"" the advice given and propping up the authors' credibility instead of focusing on the material. Additionally, the Tahl Raz/Chris Voss writing style suffers from a lack of precision. This is especially noticeable in the memoir-like sections of the book which ironically weren't that memorable. Some of the advice was also mostly applicable to very drawn-out processes (like hostage-negotiations). Ultimately, the book delivers on its promises with some flaws in its execution.Chapters 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10 all warrant a re-read."

I have a calming personality and when I was figuring out what to do after college, I briefly considered crisis negotiation as a career. My hat is off to everyone who does this kind of work. When I started reading this, I wasn't sure how much direct application it would have to my life and I was astounded by how much I learned. Chapter 4 on the role of No was a game-changer. And this is coming from someone who loves to say no! I borrowed this from the library but I'll be buying my own copy so I can refer back to it.

He uses his experiences as examples and teaches us the various available tools chapter by chapter. My key takeaways are:- We should always negotiate with empathy and try to understand the counterpart (ask open-ended calibrated questions, use mirroring)- We should bravely confront situations of conflict (making ourselves human, e.g. introducing ourselves, can elicit empathy; ""no"" does not always mean ""no"" - it could be the beginning of negotiations)- We should try to achieve the best for us without compromising (i.e. not wearing a brown and a black shoe: never split the difference; say ""no"" without saying ""no""; use odd numbers)"

Sometimes it got so serious that I almost forgot the point the author was trying to mention. I feel I need to read it again, especially because of its practical keys that if we read them solely without using them in real life, well, it would turn out to be just like an ordinary bestseller book to flip through and put it away at the end of the day. I also need to review its points, though sometimes it went so American (you know?) that I thought that boy, the context is vital too.

126,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,Rating 3 out of 5,"Chris Voss spent decades as a top hostage negotiator for the FBI––an experience that granted him a unique set of skills and perspectives. In Never Split the Difference, Voss and co-author Tahl Raz articulate these skills and perspectives, promising to demystify the art of negotiation and leave readers better prepared to negotiate with increased confidence and effectiveness. Since negotiation isn’t a particular interest of mine, I can’t comment on how this book stacks up against other negotiation-focused works, but I can say that I found Voss’s particular approach to be enlightening in some ways and distasteful in others.Never Split the Difference is a text that has a lot going for it. It’s highly readable, entertaining, and clear in its claims and objectives. Voss’s anecdotes of various hostage crises are riveting and genuinely instructive, and he does a great job of connecting specific examples to the broader lessons and concepts that comprise his theory of negotiation. Voss posits that “Negotiation is the heart of collaboration. It is what makes conflict potentially meaningful and productive for all parties” (21).At the center of Voss’s teachings is the idea that the best negotiators go the extra mile to understand the specific motivations and needs of their counterparts, thereby creating a human connection and the possibility of a deal that works out well (or well enough) for everyone. There are a handful of essential skills that aid in this process, the most important of which is “tactical empathy”:""Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow. It’s bringing our attention to both the emotional obstacles and the potential pathways to getting an agreement done."" (52, emphasis his)As a person with a natural empathy deficit, tactical empathy seems like a great tool for “faking” empathy in a situation when I may not truly feel it. Regardless of my internal experiences and judgments, it is always beneficial to listen carefully, attempt to model another’s point of view, and suggest courses of action that serve my own interests as well as those of my counterpart insofar as I perceive them.Exerting tactical empathy involves much more than simply saying the right words. Voss identifies tone, diction and body language as indispensable tools for building rapport and coming to agreements that are both practical and fair. He demonstrates a keen understanding of cognitive biases and emotional reasoning, which he uses to outline a battery of interpersonal devices that help negotiators ease tensions and make progress without giving too much ground:""Our brains don’t just process and understand actions and words of others but their feelings and intentions too, the social meaning of their behaviors and their emotions. On a mostly unconscious level, we can understand the minds of others not through any kind of thinking but through quite literally grasping what the other is feeling. Think of it as a kind of involuntary neurological telepathy––each of us in every given moment signaling to the world around us whether we are ready to play or fight, laugh or cry."" (32)This kind of thinking won’t be novel for anyone with a cursory understanding of modern psychology, but Voss does his due diligence by highlighting the importance of these unspoken features of social life.If we play our cards right by establishing an empathetic connection, we can begin to steer a negotiation in the direction we desire. My favorite articulation of this process is Voss’s description of negotiators as “decision architects” who “dynamically and adaptively design the verbal and nonverbal elements of the negotiation to gain both consent and execution” (163, emphasis his). I especially appreciate his attention in Chapter Eight to the importance not just of getting a deal done, but of ensuring that the negotiation process includes a concrete discussion of how the terms of a deal will be executed. In my own limited experience, a failure and/or inability to execute can scuttle even a mutually-beneficial business deal struck in good faith by well-intentioned negotiators.The final key feature of Voss’s strategy is the importance of seeking out “Black Swans, those hidden and unexpected pieces of information––those unknown unknowns––whose unearthing has game-changing effects” (214, emphasis his). A good negotiator always assumes there are germane details that one or both parties may not be aware of, and therefore always remains open to the possibility that the rules of the game can change. Staying calm and confident, even in the face of Black Swan revelations that negatively affect one’s position, is crucial:""Every case is new. We must let what we know––our known knowns––guide us but not blind us to what we do not know; we must remain flexible and adaptable to any situation; we must always retain a beginner’s mind; and we must never overvalue our experience or undervalue the informational and emotional realities served up moment by moment in whatever situation we face."" (218, emphasis his)This strikes me as a great lesson that we can fruitfully apply to all human undertakings, and the same can be said for a number of Voss’s other insights. However, in this strength we also find the book’s primary weakness: Voss’s failure to acknowledge that there are some contexts in which negotiation strategies might be useless or even detrimental. This failure results in some serious overreach, with Voss claiming a much larger scope of application than is warranted. He repeatedly makes it clear that his tricks of the trade can and should be broadly utilized:""Life is a negotiation…Effective negotiation is applied people smarts, a psychological edge in every domain of life: how to size someone up, how to influence their sizing up of you, and how to use that knowledge to get what you want."" (17-8)These bold assertions––that “life is a negotiation” and that negotiation strategies can confer “a psychological edge in every domain of life”­­––don’t withstand scrutiny. They sound like the gritty and hard-won observations of an effectual realist, but what they really reveal is the extent to which Voss’s professional outlook seems to limit his understanding of social life. There are numerous passages in Never Split the Difference that, while making sense within the context of negotiation theory, come off as repellent in other social contexts. Here are some examples:""'No' is the start of a negotiation, not the end of it. We’ve been conditioned to fear the word 'No.' But it is a statement of perception far more often than of fact. It seldom means, 'I have considered all the facts and made a rational choice.' Instead, 'No' is often a decision, frequently temporary, to maintain the status quo."" (78, emphasis his)""Whether we like it or not, a universal rule of human nature, across all cultures, is that when somebody gives you something, they expect something in return. And they won’t give anything else until you pay them back."" (148)""The secret to gaining the upper hand in a negotiation is giving the other side the illusion of control…[You] make your counterpart feel like they’re in charge, but it’s really you who are framing the conversation. Your counterpart will have no idea how constrained they are."" (155)""Don’t treat others the way you want to be treated; treat them the way they need to be treated."" (198)Now, since I am accusing Voss of overreach, I want to be very careful to avoid overreach in my own critiques. Let me be clear: All of the passages above seem true and sensible to me, within the limited context of formal negotiation. My argument isn’t that Voss is wrong about these claims, but rather that his framing of “life as a negotiation” opens a pathway for his advice to be misused or abused in social situations that are not negotiation-driven. In fact, Voss appears to ignore the existence of such situations altogether, instead implying that all of sociality is a tit-for-tat exchange between people who are exclusively concerned with fulfilling their personal goals and desires.Examining the first of the four passages above, it is not hard to believe those words running through the heads of serial harassers and perpetrators of sexual assault. We definitely don’t want to encourage people engaging in sexual encounters to think that the word “No” is the start of a negotiation. In the second passage, Voss points out that rules of reciprocity exist in all human cultures, but fails to acknowledge that such rules vary widely from culture to culture and that our concepts of what it means to “give” and “get” are flexible. In the third passage, one can simultaneously see the efficacy of wielding persuasive power during a negotiation and imagine the horror of being manipulated by a friend or family member who decides to inject their negotiating skills into a social encounter where it doesn’t belong. Finally, the fourth passage reveals a distressing hubris: The assumption that any of us has the intelligence or authority to decide how another person “needs” to be treated.None of this would be a problem if Voss made the effort to distinguish the social contexts in which the negotiation mindset is appropriate from ones in which it’s not, but this never occurs. This left me feeling that, despite my impression that Voss is a sincere and decent fellow, he lacks an underlying ethical framework that unleashes negotiation tactics when they are helpful and represses them when they may cause harm.Another example of this shortcoming is Voss’s churlish assessment of compromise:""Compromise––'splitting the difference'––can lead to terrible outcomes…The real problem with compromise is that it has come to be known as this great concept, in relationships and politics and everything else. Compromise, we are told quite simply, is a sacred moral good…I’m here to call bullshit on compromise right now. We don’t compromise because it’s right; we compromise because it’s easy and because it saves face. We compromise in order to say that at least we got half the pie."" (115-6)I’m not sure I’d argue that compromise is a “sacred moral good,” but I’m damned sure it’s at least a moral good of some kind. Again, Voss’s failure to complicate his arguments with the necessary nuance gets him into trouble. Contemporary American culture and politics are suffering mightily because too many people buy this idea that compromise is all about posturing and ceding ground––a sign of foundational weakness and lack of conviction. But that’s not what compromise is at all.Compromise is what happens when we accept that the world is a complex place full of folks who don’t necessarily see things the same way we do or have the same agenda, and we all have to live with each other. It is a critical tool (not the only tool) for ensuring that coexistence with others can be brokered peacefully, instead of through aggression and violence. So it’s fine for Voss to say there are particular situations in which compromise won’t get us what we want or what we need, but that reality shouldn’t also undermine the validity of compromise as an idea or sociopolitical practice. Sometimes splitting the difference is just fine, and sometimes it’s a moral imperative.Even though I���m skeptical of some of Voss’s broader claims about the applicability of his work, there’s no doubt that he’s a smart, capable person who wrote this book with laudable intentions. On the whole, Voss comes off as a humanist who views negotiation as a necessary form of conflict that, when enacted properly, can solve sticky problems and create prosperity for all:""It’s not the guy across the table who scares us: it’s conflict itself…Our emphasis throughout the book is that the adversary is the situation and that the person that you appear to be in conflict with is actually your partner…One can only be an exceptional negotiator, and a great person, by both listening and speaking clearly and empathetically; by treating counterparts––and oneself––with dignity and respect; and most of all by being honest about what one wants and what one can––and cannot––do.""

Voss does not take that perspective. He's a retired FBI hostage negotiator, specializing in international kidnappings, and half a hostage is worse than none. Negotiations aren't a logic puzzle to be solved with game theories, but an emotional war where empathy, insight, and the judo of tactical questions are your keys to success.Run The Jewels/DJ Shadow - Nobody Speak A masterclass in negotiation.The chapters in this book are framed around various criminal cases, each of which reveal some hard lesson Voss learned in his career. And while hostage negotiations are really fraught, the advice should apply to more mundane negotiations over salary and major purchases. The basic framework is one of emotional judo. You want the other party to wind up taking your side, doing your work for you, which involves understanding their worldview and what they really want. The first principle is to avoid emotional defensiveness. A basic question of ""How can I do that?"" can work wonders in getting people to see your side of the issue. Letting someone say no at first can give them the emotional comfort necessary to say yes to the big ask. A technique called labelling, where you explicitly talk about obstacles to success, including your own flaws, can help defuse tensions, while labelling what you believe the other side thinks is important can clarify real issues. When the other side is acting irrationally, look for circumstances beyond their control which might be driving their statements. And finally, use the Ackerman system for pricing. Have a real target of 100%, and start from 65%, to 85%, 95%, and finally close at 100%. Specific, non-round numbers and high anchoring help you squeeze every last dollar out of a deal.I'm not good at negotiating. I've definitely gotten screwed at the car dealership, but then again who hasn't. Hopefully, this book will help me negotiate better."

134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4184297-johara,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is an excellent resource for anyone seeking to improve their negotiation skills. It is packed with practical advice applicable to various situations ranging from everyday interactions to high-stakes negotiations.Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, shares his real-world experience and offers useful insights into negotiation strategies. Each chapter of the book covers different aspects of negotiation, such as building rapport and dealing with difficult people.My favorite part of Voss's book on negotiation is how he emphasizes how negotiation skills can be applied to all walks of life, not just hostage negotiations. He provides relatable examples throughout the book, including negotiating with a car salesman, a difficult boss, and even a toddler who refuses to eat their vegetables. This way, Voss makes the book more relatable to everyday interactions.Another valuable lesson from the book is the importance of active listening and understanding the other person's perspective and emotions. Voss provides techniques for building rapport, such as mirroring and labeling, which can help establish a connection with the other person and make them more willing to negotiate.Voss also highlights the significance of framing negotiations as a problem-solving exercise and finding mutually beneficial solutions rather than seeing them as a win-lose situation. He provides techniques for reframing conversations and making it clear that both parties have something to gain.The book includes an appendix with a variety of useful tools, such as a negotiation preparation checklist and a list of key phrases and questions to use during a negotiation.I did the audiobook, narrated by Michael Kramer. It was engaging and easy to follow, which made it an enjoyable and informative experience. Kramer's narration was particularly helpful in conveying the nuances of Voss's negotiation techniques. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in enhancing their negotiation skills. It is well-written, easy to understand, and full of practical advice. Whether you're negotiating in a personal or professional context, this book will help you become a more effective negotiator."

This is quite a change, considering I always felt about negociation as being manipulation and a thing for salesmen only (even though on a more rational level I knew negociation is everywhere in our lives and this book finally proved it to me in a very appealing way). I found many exciting ideas, I’ll just note here that I liked that it shows how a good negociatior never forces you to say yes (often a fake yes in traditional negociation), but embraces the “no”, how not trying to prove you’re the smart one and doing/saying less is so much more and how you can find common ground even with “crazy persons” who you’d never think you could settle down with (you may even find why they are not so crazy actually)."

Its only real fault is that the writing reveals on more than one occasion that the author thinks just a tad too highly of himself for my sensibilities. I am also a bit skeptical about the applicability of some of these methods in different cultural contexts. But as long as you adapt rather than directly adopt the measures, I reckon you will become a slightly more effective negotiator. Just trying it out is already a big step forward."

Never Split the Difference is to negotiating what Thinking, Fast and Slow was to psychology.The book's negotiation strategy is simple. People are not rational analysts as negotiating books would have you think. They're human - full of emotions, desires, cognitive biases. Therefore, your tactics should exploit these biases.A skilled negotiator is empathetic. They build rapport with their counter-party and listen for information.A skilled negotiator labels the barriers to agreement. ""You think I work for a big company that's not going to give you a fair deal."" Labelling neutralizes fear and generates trust.A skilled negotiator gets the other party to say ""that's right"", not ""yes"". Identify, rearticulate, and emotionally affirm the world according to your counterpart.A skilled negotiator anchors their counterpart. This can be emotionally, ""I know this is difficult, but..."") or financially (making an extremely low offer to make subsequent ones seem more reasonable).A skilled negotiator uses ""how"" or ""what"" questions. They avoid confrontation of ""why"" questions. ""How"" and ""what"" questions give your counterpart the illusion of control, get them to give up information, and have them solve your problems for you, creating empathy.A skilled negotiator uses the ""7-38-55"" percent rule by paying close attention to tone of voice and body language. Most communication is nonverbal.A skilled negotiator understands what type of person they're negotiating with: Accommodator, Assertive, or Analyst, and adjusts accordingly.A skilled negotiator prepares an Ackerman plan - 65%, 85%, 95%, and finally 100% of their budget using decreasing raises and ending on non-round numbers.A skilled negotiator looks for Black Swans - unknown unknowns that, if found, could fundamentally change the negotation. Black swans are leverage multipliers. Remember the three types of leverage:- Positive: the ability to give someone what they want.- negative: the ability to hurt someone.- normative: using your counterpart's norms to bring them around."

I'm afraid of conflict and, when I get into it, I become too aggressive and negative.This book totally changed my perspective. It didn't magically make me a competent negotiator, but it showed me how I can change that and why I should. I now have a framework to understand what's going on in a negotiation and a set of simple techniques to keep the discussion moving along. None of the techniques or insights are incredible individually—they're things people do naturally—but combining them into a coherent framework is powerful. The book helped me realize what I did that worked so that I could do it more consistently and, perhaps more importantly, it identified a number of things I do that I shouldn't.Even independent of the content, this book is incredibly well-written pedagogically. All the ideas are simple and clear. It's tempting to think that's just because the content is simple, but that's deceiving, the same way watching a skilled juggler makes juggling seem easy. The book does such a good job of building up your intuition—something other books struggle to do at all—that you don't even notice.After finishing the book, I honestly felt like I had some new toys to play with. I tried out a couple of the suggestions at my next discussion at work, and even though I did a poor job of it—definitely going to need practice and review—I still got a better outcome than I would have expected, with less hostility and strong feelings to boot. This mostly shows how low my starting level is, but it's rare to have such immediate results from any kind of book.I imagine people with natural negotiation savvy or experience won't get as much from the book as I did, but it's still worth a read. It's a fun, compelling read, and it can help you understand and organize the way you approach negotiations yourself."

The ""take it from me, I've seen some shit"" macho tone never really waned, and it made the book less enjoyable for me throughout. Like I said in my review of Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts, this book felt like another entry from the common ""celebrity -> consulting -> book"" circuit seen after someone has 'made it' in a given field. The corresponding myriad personal anecdotes sometimes supported the core material, but often were tenuously linked and served more for the author's personal brand; his consulting company is plugged multiple times.I've given the book three stars because the core content was sound and likely will range from mildly interesting to truly useful to readers depending on their current aptitude for negotiations. It too greatly resembled a playbook for my taste and I fear that some people will try to essentially automate their negotiations without ever really trying to empathize with their counterparts, but any 'how-to' book will have difficulty finding the perfect balance between describing an interesting topic and advocating its use."

Books so good that reading them is not enough, I must return to that well of knowledge repeatedly as I walk through life. Chris Voss' ""Never Split the Difference"" is one of those books. While the title sounds harsh, this is ultimately a book on negotiating well in your day-to-day life.

If you want to get a better deal on your apartment rent, read this book. If you simply want lessons from the life of an FBI hostage negotiator, then this book is for you too.

After one legit friend thoroughly recommended it, I did pick it up. And appearances can be misleading. The title suggests this to be a popular psychology book which is written with a sole mission: sell as much as possible to the masses, regardless of the usefulness of the content. Fortunately, this is not the case. Chris Voss was a practitioner first, a writer second. The gap between the two was long enough for him to become an expert at the subject, only then turning it into a comprehensive guide. The messages of the book are clear, actionable, and practical in numerous cases. It would be easy to excuse oneself that many of the strategies would not work for one's daily dealings, but once you consider that the same has been used in hostage negotiations, your excuse becomes weak. Chris really hit a home run with this one by combining years of experience with a clear action plan for newbies. Well done."

Also, you can't negotiate against clear rules or laws, even though the author forgets to mention this small fact.(2 - The Straw Man) In almost all described case studies, the author presents techniques as they were used by himself (a professional FBI-trained hostage negotiator) or one of his students in negotiations with people who are... to put it plainly, stupid.

I'm also getting tired of the too-common ""real life"" vignettes nearly every business and self-help book uses nowadays. "

The book was just too much information for me on ""How to Negotiate"", and I feel it is difficult to remember whatever the author has mentioned in the book.No doubt, the strategies given by the author as well has his keen observation of human psyche and emotions are incisive but this book would only make a difference to you if you are in a field which requires almost routine negotiations and you can hone your skills by practicing the different skills given in the book."

Over his years of experience he had contact with different types of terorist and kidnappers which he had to negociate with. Over the years the applied methods changed and evolved into a set of good practices and methods that can be applied in all kinds of situations like bussines, family, sells and other type of negociations.Each chapter comes with a real negotiation case that he worked on and emphasis the lessones learned in that situation. The book has a lot of references to another negotiation book: Getting to yes (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3...)"

Voss & Raz have co-authored an excellent book about how to negotiate without strong-arming your opponent. They outline a great framework for getting your counterpart to open up so that you both can reach a more collaborative solution. And here, by 'preparation' he means good ol' fashioned research so that as and when important information is revealed, you can make the most of it. Filled with anecdotes from Voss' FBI days, it's a very easy and fun read. Definitely worth your time!"

I tested this out on my recent trip to Mexico and did very well with the advanced anchor technique.

This book is like a big tabloid telling us how cool the author is. I do not like when ego is that big. Makes me feel uneasy and small. I guess this is to engage readers so they won't stop reading this propaganda piece. The idea of this book to manipulate other persons does not fit my world view.

170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51035324,Rating 5 out of 5,"Отличная книга про переговоры. Многое пересекается с активным слушанием Гиппенрейтер, с страхом потери Канемана, инструментамм влияния Чалдини. И даже черные лебеди Талеба проплывают мимо. Тем не менее, много практичных кейсов, инструментов.Работают всего четыре простых правила: 1. Используйте голос ночного диджея FM 2. Начните со слова «Извините» 3. «Отзеркаливайте» собеседника 4. Молчите. По крайней мере, хотя бы в течение четырех секунд дайте зеркалу оказать магическое действие на вашего противника. 5. Повторяйте. Люди, которые воспринимают переговоры как битву аргументов, становятся «заложниками» собственного внутреннего голоса. Переговоры – это не битва, это процесс от��рытия. Их цель состоит в получении как можно большего количества информации. Зеркала создают магию. Повторяете последние три слова (или критически важные слова, от одного до т��ех), которые кто-то только что сказал: мы боимся всего, что отличается от нас, и тянемся к тому, что похоже на нас. Зеркальное отражение – это искусство незаметного внушения вашему собеседнику идеи о вашем сходстве, которое облегчает установление контакта. Используйте зеркало, чтобы подтолкнуть другую сторону к усилению связи с вами, заставьте людей говорить, тяните время, чтобы ваша сторона могла перегруппироваться, и склоняйте ваших противников к тому, чтобы они открыли вам свою стратегию. Подумайте вот о чем: как можно отделить людей от проблемы, если этой проблемой являются их эмоции? Особенно когда они боятся людей с оружием. Эмоции являются одним из основных моментов, который сводит общение на нет. Как только люди выводят друг друга из равновесия, рациональное мышление тут же улетучивается. Вот почему вместо отрицания или игнорирования эмоций хороший специалист по ведению переговоров определяет их и старается повлиять на них. Он может дать точное определение эмоциям других людей и особенно своим собственным. Как только он обозначил эмоции, он может говорить о них без нервного напряжения. Для него эмоции – это инструмент. Тактическое сочувствие – это понимание чувств и установок другого человека в конкретной ситуации, а также умение слышать, что спрятано за этими чувствами. Это поможет вам повысить свое влияние во все последующие моменты. Мы концентрируем наше внимание как на эмоциональных препятствиях, так и на потенциальных возможностях, которые могут помочь прийти к согласию. Навешивание ярлык��в – это способ оценки чьих-то эмоций путем их подтверждения. Дайте чьим-то эмоциям название, и тем самым вы покажете, что знаете, что и как чувствует этот человек. Вы становитесь ближе к человеку, даже не спрашивая о внешних факторах, о которых вы ничего не знаете («Как ваша семья?»). Подумайте о навешивании ярлыков как о кратчайшем пути к близкому знакомству, как об экономящем время эмоциональном доступе. Но независимо от того, как звучит концовка, ярлыки почти всегда начинаются примерно с таких слов: По всей видимости … Ты так об этом говоришь, как будто… Похоже, что… Последнее правило ярлыка – молчание. Как только вы навесили ярлык, молчите и слушайте. У всех нас есть склонность добавлять еще что-то к уже сказанному. Нам хочется закончить фразу «Похоже, вам нравится, как выглядит эта рубашка» конкретным вопросом: «Где вы ее купили?» Но сила ярлыка состоит в том, что он сам приглашает другого человека открыться. В суде защитники часто используют этот прием, когда в самом начале своей защитной речи упоминают все, в чем обвиняется их клиент, и перечисляет все слабые места этого дела. Адвокаты называют эту технику «удалением жала».Причина, по которой ваш оппонент НЕ соглашается с вами, зачастую является более серьезной, чем причина, по которой он ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТ сделку. Поэтому сначала сосредоточьтесь на причине появления препятствий к согласию. Разрушение барьеров и негативного отношения создает доверие – так разрушьте их.Составьте список всех претензий, которые вам может высказать другая сторона, и выскажите их вслух до того, как это сделает ваш оппонент. Заблаговременный анализ обвинений поможет вам отклонить отрицательную динамику до того, как она сможет укоренеться. Так как обвинения при их проговаривании вслух часто выглядят преувеличенными, это подтолкнет вашего оппонента к тому, чтобы признать, что все не так уж плохо. Реальные изменения в поведении человека могут произойти только в том случае, если психотерапевт воспринимает своего клиента таким, какой он есть. Этот подход известен как безусловное принятие.Продвижение к фразе «все правильно» – это победная стратегия на всех переговорах. Но ответ «вы правы» – это провал. Скажите человеку «вы правы», и он со счастливой улыбкой на лице уйдет и оставит вас в покое, по крайней мере, на 24 часа. Но при этом вы не согласны с его позицией. Вы используете фразу «вы правы», чтобы к вам больше не приставали. Это означает, что вы должны научиться слышать в слове «нет» не только отказ и соответственно реагировать на него. Когда кто-то говорит вам «нет», нужно принять это слово в одном из его альтернативных значений, которых намного больше, чем тех, что приведены здесь: • я еще не готов согласиться; • мне некомфортно при разговоре с вами; • я не понимаю; • не думаю, что я могу себе это позволить; • я хочу что-нибудь еще; • мне нужно больше информации; • я хочу обговорить это еще с кем-нибудь. Фактически существуют три разных «да», обозначающих притворство, подтверждение и обязательство. Притворное «да» – это один из тех случаев, когда ваш противник планирует сказать «нет», но либо чувствует, что ответ «да» – это лучший способ побега, либо просто хочет поддержать неискренний разговор, чтобы вытянуть побольше информации или найти еще какието сильные аргументы. Подтверждающее «да»  – это, в общем, невинная, рефлексивная реакция на вопрос, требующий конкретного выбора. Иногда его используют, чтобы поставить капкан, но в большинстве случаев это лишь простое подтверждение, не обещающее никаких действий. Обязательное «да» – это настоящая сделка: это истинное согласие, которое ведет к действию, то самое «да» за столом переговоров, которое завершается подписями на договоре. Обязательное «да» – это как раз то, чего вы хотите, но все три «да» звучат почти одинаково, поэтому вы должны научиться распознавать, которое из них вы услышали в данный момент. Мы должны убеждать оппонента, исходя из его точки зрения, а не нашей. Но как это сделать? Ответ «нет» дает говорящему чувство полной безопасности и контроля над ситуацией. Вы задаете вопрос, который предполагает ответ «нет», и ваш противник чувствует, что, отказывая вам, он доказал, что именно он управляет ситуацией. Хороший специалист по ведению переговоров очень рад услышать такой ответ и даже сам склоняет противника к твердому «нет» в самом начале разговора: ведь это знак, что другая с��орона обдумывает создавшееся положение. Если вы пытаетесь продать что-нибудь, не начинайте с вопроса: «У вас есть несколько минут на разговор?» Вместо этого спросите: «Наверное, я выбрал неудачное время для разговора?» Вы услышите либо «да, сейчас неподходящее время», за которым идет просьба позвонить в другое, более удачное время или положить трубку, либо «нет, мы вполне можем поговорить», и вот тогда полностью сосредоточьтесь. Вот как я использую его: в самом начале переговоров я говорю следующее: «Я хочу, чтобы вы чувствовали, что с вами все время обращаются честно и справедливо. Поэтому, пожалуйста, остановите меня в любой момент, когда почувствуете, что я несправедлив, и мы разберемся в этом».Чтобы получить реальные рычаги давления на противника, вы должны убедить его, что, если сделка сорвется, он понесет серьезные потери. Вместо того чтобы сказать «Я хочу получать 110 000 долларов», Джерри мог сказать: «В таких компаниях, как корпорация X, люди получают за такую работу от 130 000 до 170 000 долларов». Так вы четко объясняете свою позицию и при этом не заставляете другую сторону обороняться. Человек выйдет в своих рассуждениях уже на более высокий уровень. Исследования показали, что люди, которые слышат крайние привязки, бессознательно корректируют свои ожидания в направлении первой цифры. Многие даже идут прямо к предельной цене. Если бы Джерри дал такой диапазон, то фирма, вероятно, предложила бы ему 130 000 долларов, потому что это дешевле, чем 170 000 долларов.Какие ценные жемчужины они могут получить не только за деньги, но и за то, что дешево для них, но ценно для меня.Числа, оканчивающиеся на 0, неизбежно воспринимаются во время переговоров как временные, приблизительные, которые вы можете легко заменить. Но если вы даете что-нибудь менее округленное – скажем, 37 263 доллара – это число воспринимается как результат продуманных вычислений. Такие цифры воспринимаются вашим противником как серьезные и постоянные, так что используйте их, чтобы усилить ваше предложение. Вы можете стимулировать у вашего противника порыв щедрости, если поставите на кон привязки к крайним цифрам, а затем, после неизбежного первого отказа, предложите ему не имеющий никакого отношения к делу неожиданный подарок. «Тот, кто научился не соглашаться и при этом оставаться приятным, открыл самый ценный секрет переговоров».Я называю эти вопросы точно выверенными . Вы должны выверить их аккуратно, так, как вы выверяете прицел или измерительную шкалу, чтобы наметить конкретную проблему. У меня для вас хорошие новости: существуют правила составления таких вопросов. Во-первых, старайтесь не задавать таких вопросов, на которые можно ответить либо «да», либо «нет». Вместо этого начинайте вопросы со слов, которые используют журналисты для своих интервью : «кто», «что», «когда», «где», «почему» и « как» . Эти слова наводят вашего противника на размышления и заставляют высказываться более распространенно. Но позвольте я немного сокращу этот список: лучше всего начать со слов « что» , « как» и иногда �� почему» . Больше ничего. На вопросы « кто» , « когда» и « где» ваш противник, скорее всего, будет отвечать, не вникая в суть вопроса. Вопрос « почему» может вызвать встречный огонь. Независимо от того, на каком языке произносится слово « почему», оно всегда имеет обвинительный оттенок. Единственный случай, когда можно успешно использовать вопрос « почему»,  – это когда вопрос подталкивает вашего собеседника к тем выводам, к которым вы его подводите. «Почему вы должны сменить свой привычный способ работы и применить мой подход?» – вот один из примеров. «Почему ваша компания должна сменить своего давнего поставщика и выбрать нашу компанию?» – еще один пример. Как всегда, критически важен тон голоса, уважительный и почтительный. Вот еще несколько отличных дежурных вопросов, которые я использую почти в любых переговорах, в зависимости от ситуации: • Что в этом важного для вас? • Чем я могу помочь, чтобы улучшить нашу ситуацию? • Как бы вы хотели, чтобы я поступал дальше? • Из-за чего мы оказались в этой ситуации? • Как мы можем решить эту проблему? • Какова наша цель? / К чему мы пытаемся прийти? • Как я могу это сделать?Если вы не можете держать себя в руках, не стоит рассчитывать добиться нужного поведения от других. Если в ходе переговоров вас атакуют, сделайте паузу, чтобы избежать злобной эмоциональной реакции. Вме��то этого задайте вашему противнику точно выверенный вопрос. Например, «Вы хотите прославиться как человек, который не выполняет свою часть соглашения?»Вы можете задать два ключевых вопроса, чтобы подтолкнуть вашего противника к мысли, что он определяет успех самостоятельно : «Как мы узнаем, что мы на верном пути?» и «Как все исправить, если мы выясним, что сбились с пути?». Подводите итог всего сказанного, пока не услышите в ответ: «Все правильно». Теперь вы знаете, что они согласны.Но в то же время будьте осторожны, заметив один из двух признаков того, что ваш противник не верит, что идея принадлежит ему. Я уже говорил, что ответ « Вы правы» может означать, что собеседник не очень старается вникнуть в суть дела. А если вы будете подталкивать вашего собеседника к принятию решения и он вдруг скажет «Я постараюсь» – у вас должно возникнуть неприятное чувство, потому что на самом деле такой ответ означает «Я планирую неудачу». Если вы услышите один из этих ответов, сразу же вернитесь к точно выверенным вопросам и задавайте их до тех пор, пока ваш оппонент не определит условия успешной реализации сделки и не выскажет их вслух.Правило 7:38:55. Правило гласит, что только 7 % информации мы получаем из слов говорящего, при этом 38 % информации мы черпаем из интонации, а 55 % – из языка жестов и мимики говорящего.Лжецы используют намного больше местоимений третьего лица, чем люди, которые говорят правду. Они начинают говорить его, ее, это, один человек, они и их, а не я , чтобы дистанцировать себя от лжи. Они обнаружили, что лжецы склонны использовать много слов и говорить более сложными предложениями в попытке завоевать своих недоверчивых противников. Филд имел в виду именно это, когда сказал, что вам постараются наговорить всякой ерунды. Ученые окрестили это эффектом Пиноккио, потому что количество слов растет вместе с ложью, совсем как нос Пиноккио.Девушка за стойкой спросила меня, не хочу ли я участвовать в программе для частых покупателей. Я спросил ее, полагается ли мне скидка за вступление, и она сказала: «Нет». Поэтому я решил подойти по-другому. Я дружелюбно сказал: «Меня зовут Крис. Какая будет скидка для Криса?»«Как я могу это сделать?» Вы должны произнести фразу с уважением, чтобы она стала просьбой о помощи. При правильной подаче она приглашает другую сторону участвовать в решении вашей дилеммы и предложить вам лучшее решение.Второй элегантный способ сказать «нет» – это фраза «Ваше предложение очень щедрое, но, извините, оно мне просто не подходит».Затем вы можете использовать что-нибудь вроде «Извините, но, боюсь, я просто не смогу сделать это». Эта фраза звучит более прямолинейно, а слова «я не смогу сделать это» выполняют двойную роль. Выражение вашей неспособности сделать что-то может стать причиной появления у другой стороны сочувствия к вам.То, как человек использует местоимения, показывает его место в иерархии группы. Если вы слышите «я», «мне» и «мое», значит, настоящая власть и ответственность за принятие решений этому человеку не принадлежат. Услышав много местоимений «мы», «они» и «их», можно с большей долей вероятности сказать, что вы имеете дело с человеком, непосредственно принимающим решения. План Аккермана. Перед тем как пуститься в дебри переговоров, вам нужен план «якорения» крайних цифр, точно выверенные вопросы и точное предложение. Помните: 65, 85, 95, 100 %. Все уменьшающиеся прибавки и последняя неокругленная цифра заставят вашего противника поверить, что он полностью выжал из вас все до копейки, хотя вы на самом деле подвели его к той цифре, которую вы хотите.Позитивный рычаг – это ваши способности как специалиста по ведению переговоров обеспечить или удержать то, что хочет получить ваш противник. Всякий раз, когда другая сторона говорит «я хочу…» – например, «я хочу купить вашу машину», у вас в руках оказывается позитивный рычаг. Негативный рычаг – это то, что представляют большинство людей, когда слышат слово «рычаг». Это способность специалиста по ведению переговоров заставить своего противника страдать. Он основан на угрозах: у вас есть негативный рычаг, если вы можете сказать своему противнику: «Если вы не выполните свои обязательства, не оплатите ваш счет и т. д., я разрушу вашу репутацию».Нормативный рычаг использует чужие нормы и стандарты для продвижения собственной позиции. Если вы можете указать на несоответствия между убеждениями и действиями противника, то у вас есть нормативные рычаги воздействия. У вас появляется возможность нанести урон самооценке вашего противника, признав его действия непоследовательными. Никому не хочется выглядеть лицемером.Вам придется принять, что регулярный, обдуманный конфликт – это основа эффективных переговоров и жизни. Пожалуйста, помните, что я на протяжении всей книги обращаю ваше внимание на то, что ваш противник – это ситуация, а не человек. Человек, который конфликтует с вами, – это фактически ваш партнер. Когда кто-то ведет себя иррационально или как сумасшедший, скорее всего, он таковым не является. Столкнувшись с подобной ситуацией, ищите факторы, которые ограничивают вашего противника в действиях, его скрытые желания и его неосведомленность в чем-либо.Обдумайте наилучший и наихудший сценарий ваших переговоров, но запишите только ту цель, которую вы достигнете при наилучшем исходе.

171,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15639925-t-nu-vahtra,Rating 5 out of 5,"I wasn't aware that there was an opposing view to ""Getting To Yes"" and I actually find this book more relevant in real life situations (there is only so much you can achieve by assuming that people are rational). Watch out!#Negotiation begins with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin.#Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy.#Tactical empathy brings our attention to both the emotional obstacles and the potential pathways to getting an agreement done.#Giving someone’s emotion a name, otherwise known as labeling, gets you close to someone without asking about external factors you know nothing about.#“No” provides a great opportunity for you and the other party to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don’t want.Good negotiators know that they need to be ready for surprises; great negotiators use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain to exist. Great negotiators question the assumptions that others accept on faith or in arrogance. Thus, they remain more emotionally open to all possibilities and more intellectually agile to a fluid situation. People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the voices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle; it’s a process of discovery. Your goal is to uncover as much information as possible. To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say. Your goal is to identify what your counterpart actually needs and get them feeling safe enough to talk about what they want. Negotiation begins with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators make. If you’re too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they’re not being heard and you risk undermining the rapport and trust we’ve built. (be a mirror)Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so you increase your influence in all the moments that follow. It’s bringing our attention to both the emotional obstacles and the potential pathways to getting an agreement done.Whether you call it “buy-in” or “engagement” or something else, good negotiators know that their job is to gently guide their counterpart to discover their goal as his own. Though the intensity may differ from person to person, you can be sure that everyone you meet is driven by two primal urges: the need to feel safe and secure, and the need to feel in control. If you satisfy those drives, you’re in the door.Being empatheticDuring a psychotherapy session, a psychiatrist encourages a patient to talk while he or she listens intensely. Psychiatrists know that a patient will be defensive and opposing to change until they feel heard.The same is true for a negotiation. During a negotiation, your counterpart will resist any offer you make until you prove to them that you understand what they’re saying and how they’re feeling.That’s why the first goal of a negotiation is to listen closely to the cares and concerns your counterpart has, and then summarize their cares and concerns with a statement that starts with ""it seems like..."" or ""it sounds like...""The beauty of these statements is if you’re wrong you won’t damage the conversation, since you can follow‐up your statement with “I didn’t say that how it was, it just seems that way.”However, if your counterpart affirms your summary statement with ""that's right,"" then you’ll know that you you’ve made them feel heard.After you hear a “that’s right”, your counterpart will be open to what you have to say and willing to move off their initial position.Asking for empathyWhen you have built rapport with your counterpart by being emphatic to their situation, ask them to return the favor. Get them thinking about your challenges and coming up with solutions to your problem.The best way to get your counterpart thinking about and solving one of your problems is to counter their proposals by asking ""How am I supposed to do that?"" The key is to say ""How am I supposed to do that?"" the same way you would say, ""I value your intelligence, can you please help me solve my problem?”Your counterpart will most likely do one of two things:1. Generate a creative solution so that both of you can get what you value most.2. Raise or lower their initial demand to accommodate you.If they counter with an offer that doesn't meet your needs, you simply respond with a slightly different calibrated question. Bending the reality (persuading other party that they have something to lose if the deal does not come through):#Anchoring emotions#Letting the other guy go first#Establish a range#Pivot to non-monetary terms#When you do talk numbers, use odd ones#Surprise with a giftCreate the Illusion of ControlWhen you go into a store, instead of telling the salesclerk what you “need,” you can describe what you’re looking for and ask for suggestions. Then, once you’ve picked out what you want, instead of hitting them with a hard offer, you can just say the price is a bit more than you budgeted and ask for help with one of the greatest-of-all-time calibrated questions: “How am I supposed to do that?”Find the Black SwanAs a negotiator, you should always be aware of which side, at any given moment, feels they have the most to lose if negotiations collapse.To get leverage, persuade your counterpart that they have something real to lose if the deal falls through.At a taxonomic level, there are three kinds of leverage: Positive, Negative, and Normative:#Positive leverage is quite simply your ability as a negotiator to provide—or withhold—things that your counterpart wants. When they say that, you have power.#Negative leverage is what most civilians picture when they hear the word “leverage.” It’s a negotiator’s ability to make his counterpart suffer.#Normative leverage is using the other party’s norms and standards to advance your position. If you can show inconsistencies between their beliefs and their actions, you have normative leverage.Discovering the Black Swans that give you normative valuation can be as easy as asking what your counterpart believes and listening openly. You want to see what language they speak and speak it back to them. Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Work to understand the other side’s “religion.” Digging into worldviews inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table and into the life, emotional and otherwise, of your counterpart. That’s where Black Swans live. Exploit the similarity principle. People are more apt to concede to someone they share a cultural similarity with, so dig for what makes them tick and show that you share common ground.“A woman wants her husband to wear black shoes with his suit. But her husband doesn’t want to; he prefers brown shoes. So what do they do? They compromise, they meet halfway. And, you guessed it, he wears one black and one brown shoe. Is this the best outcome? No! In fact, that’s the worst possible outcome. Either of the two other outcomes—black or brown—would be better than the compromise. Next time you want to compromise, remind yourself of those mismatched shoes.”“Negotiate in their world. Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It’s about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. So don’t beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals. It’s not about you.” "
172,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8024216-samridhi-khurana,Rating 4 out of 5,"One of the finest reads on how to lead negotiation in day to day events. More than strategy/ tactic, it’s a mindset shift from getting bogged down by the idea of negotiating with someone to embracing a series of empathy-led tactical conversation. It’s not selfish or manipulative to make a deal that we strive for. Getting over the fear of conflict and difficult conversations is a good starting point for me.Some of the key takeaways for me are as follows: - Mirrors work magic. Repeat what someone just said to build a bond with them- You don’t need to agree with other person’s point of view. But you need to acknowledge their views. Call it out so that they know you are listening- Label your counterpart’s fears to bring them to a safe space with you. List the worst things out in open (accusation audit) so that the negative dynamics is settled upfront - “No” is not a bad state to start from. Learn how to hear it calmly. It’s not the end of the negotiation, but the beginning. And is better than a counterfeit yes. Instead strive for “that’s right” in a negotiation- use a summary to trigger “that’s right”. Identity, re-articulate and emotionally affirm the world according to the counterpart- Negotiate in their world. Persuasion is not how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It’s about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. It’s not about you. And it is not being manipulative.- Ask them open ended questions that begin with a what or how, rather than why (which triggers defensiveness)- Calibrate your questions that lead towards the answers you want, but problem solve with the counterpart. Help them lead you to the answer you want- Compromise is overly glorified. It’s like meeting midway with the person wearing one black shoe and one brown shoe. No deal is better than a bad deal- Approaching deadlines entice people to rush the negotiation process and do impulsive things that are against their best interests. Avoid that- People may drop the “fair” word. Don’t lose your calm. Talk to them on what makes them thing they are not being treated fairly- Bend your counterpart’s reality by anchoring them to a starting point that is overly exaggerated - Getting into a negotiation expecting the other person thinks like you is madness. It’s not empathy, it’s projection"

(Edit - on second thoughts, rounding down to 3)I read this almost immediately after I read Jim Camp's START WITH NO. In comparison, I didn't like this one as much. Did Voss teach me strategies that Camp didn't? Indeed. But most, if not all, examples were about one-time deals. I read this book to learn to negotiate in my day-to-day life. I plan to do it with my loved ones and long term business contacts. Camp's approach was to treat the adversary as someone who wants to keep doing/having business/relationship with you. His approach was long term. Voss's approach is to squeeze out the last drop. There are times when I would need to do that. I definitely want to know how to do that. But that would be rare. Camp's approach is what I would use 99% of the time.The book is well written and has great insights. But it being set in the capitalistic world didn't sit well with me."

178,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"You will mostly find mixed reviews of this book, and I believe that most of the people could not absorb the book in a way the author wanted them to. There is no doubt about the fact that this book is a negotiation primer for everyone out there longing for a handbook they can leverage to make the best out of any conversational opportunity, but there are certain things that should be kept in mind to build up a rapport with the author. Do not expect every chapter to give you an out of the box ready to use tool. What it strengthens is the psychological underpinning that will help you establish a real relationship with your counterpart. Once a real rapport is formed with your counterpart, you yourself will have to steer your boat, but this book surely helps you with deciding the direction. Rather than imitating the author's tactics thoughtlessly, it would be a lot better if one focuses on between the lines takeaways that he wants to offer. Happy reading!"

211,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28607568-manisha,Rating 4 out of 5,"Notes Summary: 2. Stop making assumptions and listen actively - Find out as much as possible, find out what they need and encourage them to reveal their strategy. Make them feel safe enough to reveal their needs (bare minimum deal) and wants (aspirations). Validate their emotions, create trust and safety for a real conversation to begin. Slow and calm down the process. -Late night FM DJ voice (voice of calm and reason by inflecting voice downwards). You can be direct and to the point and long as you create safety by tone of voice. Use this selectively to make a point.  -Positive/playful voice - Easy going, good natured person, default. Relax and smile while talking ,even on the phone.  Mirroring - signals alikeness, facilitating bonding. Negotiators mirror words. “repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said.” They will elaborate and it will sustain the process of connecting.  Use silence (at least 4s) after your mirror for a response.  Start with I’m sorry while while mirroring aggressive people/boss.  Mirroring will feel awkward at first and requires practice.   Use skills to reveal surprises.  3. Tactical empathy - Recognize your counterpart’s perspective, feelings and mindset, recognise what drives/moves them, vocalise the recognition then gain trust and understanding through  Labeling—that is, by repeating that perspective back to them, validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging it. Reinforce good aspects and diffuse negative ones. Use labels to reinforce positive perceptions. Applying rational words disrupts raw intensity of emotions like fear. It sounds like, seems like, looks like.. don’t use I. It is useful to expose negative thoughts and when someone is tense. Identify the primary underlying emotion. After you label, be silent and listen.   Defuse negative dynamics by bringing them into the open - when you make mistakes or anger someone. Disarm your counterpart’s complaints about you by speaking them aloud in an Accusation Audit - lay bare the worst accusations and negative labels.“List the worst things that the other party could say about you and say them before the other person can.” 4. Start negotiations with No. Acknowledge counterpart’s right to choose, right to say no. It gives the speaker a sense of safety, autonomy and control. With a no, you can understand what about it doesn’t work for the other person. Better to ask is now a bad time to talk than do you have a few minutes. Usually questions to get a no should be towards their beliefs than the decision at hand. E.g. You are not trying to get a no to a do you want to donate question, but to a do you want things to stay the same way question - they will say no to this, be more open to donating.  You could even mislabel emotions or ask a ridiculous question like it seems like you want this project to fail or ask them what they will say no to. If someone does not say no, either they are confused, indecisive or have an agenda.  “If a potential business partner is ignoring you, contact them with a clear and concise “No”-oriented question that suggests that you are ready to walk away. “Have you given up on this project?” works wonders.” 5. Create an atmosphere of unconditional positive regard. Strive for “That’s right” instead of “Yes” at every stage of a negotiation, and identify, rearticulate, and emotionally affirm your counterpart’s worldview with summaries and paraphrasing.  Figure out how your adversary arrived at their position.   “Before you convince them to see what you’re trying to accomplish, you have to say the things to them that will get them to say, “That’s right.” “Use a summary to trigger a “that’s right.” The building blocks of a good summary are a label (acknowledging underlying emotions) combined with paraphrasing. Identify, rearticulate, and emotionally affirm “the world according to the person you are negotiating with”. 6. Meeting half way often leads to bad deals. No deals are better than bad deals sometimes.  Deadlines are often arbitrary, almost always flexible, and hardly ever trigger the consequences we think—or are told—they will. They are self inflicted and unsettle us for no reason. Navigate deadlines to create urgency for counterpart.    If someone says you are not fair, ask them to explain how you are mistreating them. It is better to state at the beginning that you want them to feel they are being treated fairly at all times, and to stop you if they feel you are being unfair.   “You can bend your counterpart’s reality by anchoring his starting point. Before you make an offer, emotionally anchor them by saying how bad it will be. When you get to numbers, let the other person go first, set an extreme anchor to make your “real” offer seem reasonable (use odd numbers), or use a range to seem less aggressive (the lower number should be what you are looking for). Surprise with a gift / find out if there are any non monetary benefits that they can offer you. The real value of anything depends on what vantage point you’re looking at it from. “To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through.”“People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain.”  Frame negotiations in such a way that counterpart will accept the limits you place. Chapter also includes information on salary negotiations. 7. Use calibrated questions - How? and What?. Eliminating yes and no answers will force counterpart to apply their mental energy to solve your problems. Use questions to guide them towards solving the problem. Ask how they would like to proceed, why something is important, how can we solve this, what are we trying to accomplish, how am I supposed to do that.  This gives the other side the illusion of control.  If they renege on an agreed term - what did they have in mind, when they first signed off on something.  8. Use how to say no.  “There are two key questions you can ask to push your counterparts to think they are defining success their way: “How will we know we’re on track?” and “How will we address things if we find we’re off track?” When they answer, you summarize their answers until you get a “That’s right.” Then you’ll know they’ve bought in.” “When you hear either of these (I’ll try or you’re right), dive back in with calibrated “How” questions until they define the terms of successful implementation in their own voice. Follow up by summarizing what they have said to get a “That’s right.”   “Is the “Yes” real or counterfeit? Test it with the Rule of Three: use calibrated questions, summaries, and labels to get your counterpart to reaffirm their agreement at least three times. It’s really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction.Influence deal killers if they are not at the table.  -Ask counterpart what their colleagues not on table will think the challenges will be. A high % of negotiations hinge on self esteem, status and non financial needs of the people involved. Use what and how to avoid making bids and adjusting position. - Dodge and weave. 9. Bargaining - Prepare, dodge an aggressive counterpart and get on the offensive.  “Get ready to take a punch. Kick-ass negotiators usually lead with an extreme anchor to knock you off your game. If you’re not ready, you’ll flee to your maximum without a fight. So prepare your dodging tactics to avoid getting sucked into the compromise trap.” “Prepare an Ackerman plan. Before you head into the weeds of bargaining, you’ll need a plan of extreme anchor, calibrated questions, and well-defined offers. Remember: 65, 85, 95, 100 percent. Decreasing raises and ending on nonround numbers will get your counterpart to believe that he’s squeezing you for all you’re worth when you’re really getting to the number you want.”10. Black swan - 3-5 pieces of information that when uncovered change everything. Recognise the markers and employ black swans to gain leverage over counterpart.  Try to understand their worldview and show that you share common ground. When someone seems irrational, look for constraints, hidden desires and bad information.  Get FaceTime with your counterpart instead of interacting only on email.  “Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Remember the three types of leverage: positive (the ability to give someone what they want); negative (the ability to hurt someone); and normative (using your counterpart’s norms to bring them around).”"

214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3960665-ryan,Rating 5 out of 5,"Probably the best book on business negotiation that I've ever read. FBI hostage negotiator, but lessons largely applied to business (he runs a business negotiation consultancy now). The most interesting part is how the ""Getting to Yes"" early-1980s Harvard technique is pretty solidly defeated by a more modern behavioral (emotional) technique which can be implemented using some relatively straightforward rules and techniques. The most innovative part is his believe in ""black swan"" factors which can be uncovered through research (usually 3-5 per deal) which can produce quantum-superior results if known -- e.g. knowing that the counterparty has a pending debt they need to cover and thus must get cash quickly in a transaction, even at below full market value. There's probably a fair bit of opportunity to expand on this book in terms of information gathering/intelligence and various forms of questioning and searching for ""tells"" in the transaction, as well as extending the framework to ongoing business relationships vs. one-off negotiations.(Incidentally, the use is rather dated in high-end hostage negotiation, at least in the post-9/11 world. If a terrorist group takes Americans hostage overseas, such as if the Dos Palmas kidnapping from 2001 happened again, they don't send in a split-command FBI-led negotiation team to talk them out with host nation tactical assistance; the only negotiation question is ""which Delta team is on ready alert right now?"". Interesting that pre-1970s, ""tactical"" solution was the way -- then various hostage negotiation was developed due to the weaknesses in that -- and then in the post-9/11 world, the new threat means a return to even-better tactical solutions instead.)"
215,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68465647-sophia,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars. On the whole, I liked this book. It was an easy read- aimed at people who are not very self-aware or alternatively, green in business negotiating. Things like mirroring, overcoming objections, and open-ended questions are basics and not where this book shines. But chapters on the three types of people in negotiations (analyst, accommodation, assertive) and the Black Swan Theory were much more interesting. The title is catchy and has probably directly influenced this book's success but is not the most relevant title for the contents. Negotiating by definition IS splitting the difference, it's just how much you split it by. Voss talks a lot (rightly so) about hostage negotiation but the everyday negotiations the reader is going to be having are with their kids, colleagues, and highest risk, spouse or boss/client. In most of these everyday situations ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" (to quote the author) isn't an option. He gives an example of a wife/husband negotiating about what color shoes he should wear with his suit, ending in the man wearing one brown shoe and one black shoe. (Terrible example, I would have liked to hear a negotiation about budgeting for vacations for the upcoming year or a negotiation about household tasks.) The whole point of having to negotiate in real-life (hostage negotiation is thankfully not in my, or many, lived experience) is coming to a solution to a problem. If it isn't an example from the author's personal experience with a hostage negotiation or a publicly known example of hostage negotiation, it's an example from one of his students... which I found to be a little far-fetched and not wholly applicable either.So... great tips in negotiation tactics but terrible examples to make his point."
216,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60497478-jen,Rating 5 out of 5,"Negotiation is inevitable in almost all communications. In the author's situation, it is a bit different - he is hostage negotiator and needs negotiation to save lives. He has to get everything he asks for in his job, without giving anything back of substance, and do so in a way that leaves the adversaries feeling as if they have a great relationship. His work is emotional intelligence on steroids. How did he do that? I have found several paradoxical (yet useful) statements in his book:1. For example, good negotiators welcome—even invite—a solid “No” to start, as a sign that the other party is engaged and thinking. Most people are terrified by the word ""No"". However, it is a liberating moment that open the path forward. 2. One of the most powerful word in negotiation is ""How"". The answer ""Yes"" means nothing without a ""How"". Instead, you have to convince the counterpart to see what you are trying to accomplish and get them to say ""That's right"" to reach an actual deal. If you use ""How"" questions correctly, you are saying ""No"" in a gentle and graceful way and guide your counterpart to develop a better solution - your solution. The book also discussed examples of deal negotiations and salary negotiations. In summary, effective negotiation is applied people smarts, a psychological edge in every domain of life: how to size someone up, how to influence their sizing up of you, and how to use that knowledge to get what you want."

In short simple terms- it means that it's focused mainly on ""zero sum game"" negotiations than on mutual agreements where everyone wins. This book doesn't provide too much theoretical background (term BATNA is not even mentioned, I think), but practical cases from author's personal experience are interesting enough to keep reader engaged. There are some practical advises, but (at least for me) they seemed like formed by Cpt. Obvious - well, maybe I've just read too much on the topic.Anyway, what bothers me most is that when author has decided to write a book he didn't think much about readers - who's his preferred target audience, what he'd like to ""deliver"" as the real, applicable value. He just had his interested (& quite specific - narrow) experience & he wanted to discount it. No blame, but it doesn't make a good book."

Chris Voss does address these concerns, but is unable to convince me as a reader.At times, Chris is trying to negotiate a case with the reader, trying to get him to continue reading the book. And he does this without an attempt at developing tactical empathy/rapport, something which he stresses so highly upon.

223,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I always believed (mostly unconsciously) that conflict is a bad thing. This book changed this perspective for me. Conflicts, when managed respectfully, are great. They can lead to solving problems and helping counterparts getting what they want. Think of relationships, when the two sides are not happy with the current situation, but never solve the problems out of the fear of conflict. The same is true in many other parts of life. Career is another example. People don't say what they want/need and grow anger and resentment inside, towards their manger or the company. This is the book's biggest lesson for me. The book explains how negotiation is mostly about discovering the other side. Listening, building rapport (so that they share their fears and concerns), and asking clarifying open-ended questions. You ultimately want to know what other people need, so that you can get them what they want, while you get what you want. "

It's been over a decade since I took the seminar and I can recall maybe two or three instances of having used what I learned there. I got much more actionable advice from Voss' book, which cost me $27.37, than from that seminar, which cost my employeer $10000 plus airline tickets, accomodation, and a week of my salary-hours."

271,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94823968-megan-moss,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars rounded up. This is a book about negotiation written by a former FBI agent who has negotiated with the most high-stakes terrorists and kidnappers all over the world. What I didn’t like: -I felt like I was set up to believe that the skills taught in this book would be pretty applicable to multiple types of situations, and I didn’t see that. I think the techniques are pretty geared towards a business or extreme situation like a hostage negotiation. I really liked what he said briefly about conflict being a healthy, important part of everyday life, and how we need to embrace negotiation at the dinner table and in everyday conversation but I wanted examples of what that looked like. —I also felt like some of the advice was pretty manipulative. He lightly touched on how proper negotiation allowed both parties a chance to explain what they needed, but it seemed that ultimately it was all about getting what you wanted out of a situation. I understand that when negotiating with a kidnapper or terrorist, it doesn’t make sense to meet in the middle, but I have a hard time believing that business transactions can’t be more about compromising. I guess I’m not cutthroat enough for the business world. What I really liked: —The writing was very good. It was concise, persuasive, and super organized. I knew what I was going to learn in each chapter and I liked the recap at the end. —The examples were out of this world. I loved the way he told these awesome stories to explain his key points. His stories were memorable, sometimes had some humor, which was unexpected, and really backed up what he was saying. I was hanging on the edge of my seat during these first hand accounts. —The author is humble. He didn’t hesitate to break apart his errors and share what he would do differently. He’s learned a lot from identifying where he could have done something better. That’s admirable. —This book was like a pep talk. It felt like the author was cheering me on and believed in me—that’s a fun tone and it really felt like he was on the readers side. Overall, this was a great road trip listen my husband and I both enjoyed."
272,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7854466-pablo-mar-a-fern-ndez,Rating 2 out of 5,"In 2018 I bought this at betterworldbook.com for AR$219 (around 10USD) among other books on leadership and innovation. As it usually happens when you buy books online, I felt a little disappointed: having read a couple of books on negotiation and studied the subject during my major I didn’t find so many new ideas. The most useful chapter for me was the appendix in which he teaches how to prepare a negotiation one sheet. There he summarizes the most important parts of the book. Short, straight to the point with useful advice. Definitely you don’t need to read the whole 250 pages because there are many stories of the author's life at the FBI that you can happily skip. Fortunately, at the end of each chapter you will find “Key lessons” and maybe reading only them will get you 80% of this book’s value. Some concepts are common sense like ""listen more than talk"" or vague and difficult to capture like suggesting using “a FM voice”. Maybe for an online course with examples but hard to teach it on paper. Others are directly wrong, like citing the famous Mehrabian 55-37-7 rule that we already know has no scientific proof behind. A few ones are worth giving them a try: positive and negative leverage, the different types of negotiators (analyst, accommodator, assertive), labeling, summary or how to understand and use the different “yes” and “no’s” for example.In summary, I think the overall premise of the book is wrong: having experience negotiating in life threatening situations doesn't qualify Chris Voss to teach you how to ask for a raise, advance in your professional care or make a sale. Hence, if you read only one book on negotiation there are probably other ones shorter and more useful or maybe a Coursera/Udemy training with video and audio can be a better option for this type of content."
273,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,Rating 4 out of 5,"The best parts of Never Split the Difference, a negotiation self-help book, are the anecdotes that Chris Voss, a former hostage negotiator, shares. In movies, the FBI hostage negotiator always looks like an idiot, perhaps because those characters are the only ones in the film and in the audience who aren't hoping for a shoot out.In retrospect, it's not surprising that Hollywood appears to undervalue hostage negotiators, but, if this book is any guide, the movies accurately capture how badly law enforcement agencies cooperate with each other. At one point, inmates agree to release the guards they've taken hostage and to return themselves to custody; fearing that the guards will beat them, they agree to come out one at a time with a radio so that they can tell the rest of the group when they're back in jail that they were not harmed. The prison guard, however, immediately takes away the radio from the first prisoner who is returning to custody. These slip ups happen repeatedly, so much so that it was surprising to me how few people question Voss's advice on communication.But the hostage stories are engaging. And although ""listen to this, I got a *great* deal"" is almost always an invitation for me to tune out of a conversation, the stories in which Voss's students negotiate better deals were also somehow thrilling. Even when I was skeptical of the theory, I just couldn't get enough of them.And there are lots of fun interpersonal dynamics that I felt like I had stumbled upon or that I felt like it would be fun to try. I would buy this book just to return to it for interpersonal games to play."
274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37912141-willy-xiao,Rating 4 out of 5,"Part memoir, part guidebook, part advertisement for the black swan group (link to company website provided at the end), and part critique of status quo academia around negotiation. The central thesis of the book, if there is one, is that negotiation is less about the verbal chess played between two opponents, so much as it is about psychology and emotion. I don't know the academic consensus on negotiation to judge how insightful this book is, though I'm certainly aware of popular concepts (""growing the pie"" and ""BATNA"" and ""ZOPA"") that he paints as hyper-rational, conventional wisdom. While I agree with this central idea, I didn't find much of the first half to be particularly interesting; mirrors, labeling, accusation audit, calibrated questions probably aren't best explored in the narrow context of negotiation than in crucial conversations and/or non-violent communications. If you haven't been exposed to ""conventional wisdom"" around negotiation, it might be worth reading some basic elements of negotiation theory/academia as the book glosses over this element and is less relevant when not placed within that context.I did, however, find the summary at the end of each chapter to be useful checklists to prepare and structure future negations. The bullet-point medium is particularly well suited for high-paced, high stakes negotiations. I ultimately enjoyed reading the book, especially reading the (quite literal) war stories that Chris has undergone in his career. In the face of imminent danger, he retains a certain level of detachment and seems primarily motivated by personal fulfillment, which I found almost a bit scary. For example, he limited the payout of a series of hostage negotiations to < $5,000 each almost as a point of personal pride.Overall, the stories sprinkled throughout kept me interested in reading, and I now know the reasoning behind each of the bullets in my newly constructed negotiation one-sheet."
275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5754705-dana,Rating 4 out of 5,"Never Split The Difference was a book that my book club selected, but that had been suggested to me many times before. This was filled with both personal stories from hostage negotiator Chris Voss, and tips to succeed in negotiations. It was an extremely interesting read that I would highly recommend. The first thing that made this book so great was the content. Because the material was so specific, I found this hard to read for long periods. I read a chapter at a time, then stopped to really reflect on the tips and advice of the chapter. And there was tons of advice to think about. At the beginning of the book, Voss explained how he and the people he worked for had failed in so many negotiations because they didn't have a clear understanding of what tactics worked and why. Once they figured out what worked, they created a a blueprint to how to constantly achieve positive results. Second, Voss was able to communicate the tactics for each step of negotiations clearly. He provided examples of how the communication should take place and even gave advice for divergence. That made this seem as comprehensive as a book could be. Actually, was captivated me early on was Voss' humility. Throughout this, he gave so many examples of ways he went wrong while negotiating that it made him credible, and more importantly, made me like him. That was almost more valuable than the positive information provided. This was great and I would highly recommend it! "
276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107962510-evita,Rating 5 out of 5,"Excellent book that changed my perspective on negotiation - it is not a competition! Instead of bargaining for middle way or seeking win-win, acknowledge that everyone has their own sense of what is fair, emotions play higher role than logic - people may refuse what’s good for them just because it seems unfair (example of splitting 10$).Some of my favourite quotes:Slow down to make people feel heard. Mirroring - repeat the other’s last 3 or key words in a question form to hear more. Negotiation is not a battle, it’s a process of discovery where the goal is to uncover as much information as possible. Don’t feel their pain, label it. Say “it sounds like…” instead if “what I heard is…”Neutralize the negative, reinforce the positive. Provide sense of control. The one who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable, has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation. Summarize the situation + How am I supposed to do that?Start with What or How, sometimes Why, but note that Why is perceived accusatory. To guarantee implementation:…How does this affect the rest of your team?…How on board are the people who are not on this call?…What do your colleagues see as the main challenge in this area?Black swan - don’t look to verify what you expect, if you do that’s what you’ll find. Instead open yourself up to factual reality that’s in front of you. …Ask yourself why are they communicating what they are communicating right now?…Read non-verbal clues and always voice your observations with your counterpart.

277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5631879-rachael,Rating 4 out of 5,"I should start this review by saying that I listened to the audiobook version of this, rather than reading the book. I'm not 100% sold on audiobooks, but I do a lot of walking and needed to mix it up by listening to something other than my usual podcasts. This book had been on my to-read list for some time, so I figured why not.I thought this book provided lots of very helpful techniques that were explained well through examples from a range of different contexts. I certainly think I will use some of these techniques in the future. That said, I do think it is hard to change habits from merely reading a book, and suspect that the author's training courses and coaching services would be much more effective for that - certainly something I would consider if negotiation becomes a bigger part of my job.My one complaint is that I felt some of the anecdotes were out of place and distracting. They felt like they were included principally so the author could brag about his boat, his truck, etc. I also got a reasonably strong sense of the author's political views from some of his comments, which again was just unnecessary distraction from the points he is trying to make. More care with how some of these anecdotes are presented could avoid this and keep the focus on the point of the book."

It will take you for a ride with an ex FBI hostage negotiator and the secrets of tactical empathy, how to speak up, get you what you want, and make everyone happy. This feels exactly how Mr. Kristo Käärmann managed people at Wise in the heyday. He never told you what to do, he basically went inception on you with How and Why questions to get *you* to discover what he wanted you to do, sometimes even weeks or months later! I FINALLY FOUND KRISTO'S SECRETS!!! It's about getting the other person to a ""that's right"", winning them over, and then pushing them with questions (labels and mirrors) to the solution you want.Fantastic book for understanding people in business and life. Definitely pick it up, you won't regret it!Key points:* Negotiation begins with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin.* Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterparts to reveal their strategy.* Tactical empathy brings our attention to both the emotional obstacles and the potential pathways to getting an agreement done.* Giving someone’s emotion a name, otherwise known as labeling, gets you close to someone without asking about external factors you know nothing about.* “No” provides a great opportunity for you and the other party to clarify what you really want by eliminating what you don’t want.Summary: https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/bo..."

Whether that conversation hinges upon the successful release of hostages is something else entirely. Or is it..?In Chris Voss' book, Never Split the Difference, he brings his years of field experience in speaking to some of the most unstable people on the planet and he breaks down the elements into easy to understand (& adopt) principles. For example, he shares how a repetitive series of ""What"" and ""How"" questions can help you overcome the aggressive tactics of a manipulative adversary. ""How do you recommend I go about getting you what you want?"" or ""What are some ways that I can make sure I can get you what you're asking for?"" This is more engaging and avoids the hard ""Yes"" and ""No"" answers. It gives the aggressor the illusion that they are the ones calling the shots, that they are in control when in fact it is you who is steering the conversation.Chris Voss has heightened my awareness and has me now looking at every conversation as some form of negotiation. I'm going to have to remember when to turn it on and off and I will always remember to use the phrase, ""That's right"" as opposed to ""You're right"". The implications are life-changing!"

281,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108603982-kevin-luo,Rating 4 out of 5,"An excellent book written by an FBI negotiator, Chris Voss, Never Split the Difference delves deeply into the art of negotiation, some ideas around negotiation, and techniques. Whether someone is attempting to negotiate a salary, home price, or something else, all of us will at some point be faced with negotiating. And I would say many of us would shy away from it, as it is not comfortable.Voss tries to change that narrative by highlighting that while we do not have to like negotiating, we should be aware of how to do it effectively. He walks through examples and techniques to illustrate various points and I believe that as a whole, this book was clear in explanations. There are a lot of points to consider and that learning how to negotiate is a skill that all of us can learn. I will say that ultimately, I believe a seminar format would be best to learn these techniques, rather than a book, as many of these stories and techniques will require repetition and practice to learn. But as a whole, a great starting point to learn about negotiating. "
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59266200-maynerd,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ok, so I was quite skeptical at first, but it grew on me. The book is great. A lot of it is common sense that we take for granted, but it's expalined so well that it helps put common sense to common use - at least, it did for me. The main reason I was sketptical at first is because of the way Voss insists on 'never splitting the difference' which I interpreted as never give in a negotiation, and only focus on taking what you deserve, but I realized later that that was not his point. His point is that no deal is better than a bad deal, don't ever get a bad deal for yourself. Which is a great point. As someone who works in sales and needs that comission money, I do forget that sometimes. There's a lot to learn from this book, I don't want to spoil it because Voss' storytelling is great, and also this book deserves to be bought, however I will at least summarise: I learned how to approcah a deal, how to negotiate price range, how to frame requests, how to handle bad haggling and nonsensical offers, and more! My biggest take away is, anything that can be negotiated, has potential to end up being a great deal for you - so don't shy away from the negotation table. "

Show people you care about them by listening. Actively listen by repeating what they say. Repeating what they say? Repeat what they say! Fun and helpful for building friendships as much as negotiating salary. The chapter on the Power of No is particularly interesting. Some questions I have walking away from the book: How do we develop a virtue of deference in a dominance obsessed society? How do we guard against negotiation becoming manipulation? What does it mean to genuinely listen and understand without the pressure to concede? What lessons could the church learn from this posture of attentive listening?

A couple of the lessons I found particularly easy to implement:1. Empathy is more important for communicating and persuading than logic or reason - focus more on the other side's perspective and emotions 2. Silence is very powerful - let the other party do most of the talking, this will allow you to better understand their perspective and constraints. 3. Labelling, mirroring, calibrated questions and summarizing are very useful because serves the dual purpose of effective listening and also helps the other party be heard4. Try to remember that the other party is not the adversary in conflicts and negotiations, but rather the adversary is the situation. Do not be afraid of conflicts. "

I'd broadly recommend this one as I think in general, people (myself included) are bad negotiators, think there's a stigma against it, and often don't even recognize opportunities for negotiation, like asking for additional benefits when you receive a job offer or performance review, or talking down a rent increase. For me, the last few chapters tapered off in quality/applicability. The book was about the perfect length at ~240 pages. "
290,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51588923-shhhhh-ahhhhh,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was a good book. I already wrote an entire review here which failed to post (thanks so much Goodreads for having this ""Saving... - All changes saved."" nonsense at the bottom of this field but then never actually saving a damn thing apparently), and I do not think it will be useful for me to rewrite it in full, so I'm going to summarize. Voss argues that we approach negotiation wrong and structures it as a human game (a game centered around the rules and constraints that all humans operate under, rather than a logical exercise), and exploits psychology to reach his aims. His work is grounded in real successes and failures, so I'm inclined to favor it over other works. Here are some basic takeaways:- Have a BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement)- Don't ask what people mean. Do repeat the last 3 words to demonstrate you're listening and express curiosity. - Seek a ""that's right!"" from someone, rahter than a ""you're right"". In other words, get them to admit you understand their position fully, then they will be pliable for further negotiation. - Negotiation starts after ""no"", after the boundaries have been identified. - ""Yes"" is not a good thing necessariyl. People say ""yes"" just to get you out of their face sometimes. ""No"" can be far more emotionaly compelling. - Make the opponent do your work for you. - Ask calibrated questions. ""How am I supposed to do that?"" and ""What do you hope to accomplish by doing this?"" These defuse anger and force the person to go 'off-script' to answer your non-binary question. These can also move your opponent to where you want to go. - Listen intently for black swans. These are unknown unkonwns that can change the entire negotiation playing field. Find them and exploit them. - Use the ""late night DJ"" voice to keep things calm. - Be transparent about your deadlins and don't let the other sides use those against you. Remember that when the opportunity to negotiate ends for you, it ends for them too. - Be aware of your negotiation style so that you won't be gamed by the methods which work best against it. - Prepare a list of objections and address those head on to diffuse them. Put those up front in the discussion and let the person either affirm or deny them so that they are taking a clear stance. - Do not deviate from the methods indicated, even if things feel shaky. Don't be robotic but don't let your own doubt about their efficacy interfere with their efficacy. Do recommend for literally anyone. As Voss points out, we're all negotiating all of the time. "
291,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Short and sweet. Negotiation isn't limited to salary discussions or haggling with vendors in side street shops. Voss provides his own negotiation framework having placed classroom theory through the fires of his life experience as veteran FBI negotiator. Made me scratch my head at my own negotiation mistakes, but also allowed me to pat myself on the back for things I've gotten correctly on occasion. Thanks to Voss, I can now recognize and label these with his language. It's a failing on my business school that they don't have any undergrad classes on negotiation."
292,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. What a fascinating book. My awe is perhaps influenced by my complete avoidance of almost all types of negotiation or conflict, thus this is a completely foreign world to me. This book however, gives you the tools to not only feel comfortable negotiating, but to become an active listener. What I found most fascinating is, learning how to be a good active listener is primarily the focus of the book. Every chapter also has really fascinating stories of negotiations with good and bad outcomes. Highly recommend. "

Compromise, we are told quite simply, is a sacred moral good. I’m here to call bullshit on compromise right now. We don’t compromise because it’s right; we compromise because it is easy and because it saves face. We compromise in order to say that at least we got half the pie. Distilled to its essence, we compromise to be safe. Most people in a negotiation are driven by fear or by the desire to avoid pain. Too few are driven by their actual goals. So don’t settle and — here’s a simple rule — never split the difference."""
294,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68161517-alyse,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was nearly a 5 star book for me... but I'm a woman.Still, I picked up the book knowing it was written by a man because, honestly, I find negotiating extremely uncomfortable. Yes, some (okay, a lot) of the advice seems to be borderline manipulation tactics that I would never employ, but it was still interesting. And there is definitely some gems in there that I will put to use the next time I find myself at a standstill. Maybe more valuable, though, is the way I feel like I will be able to ""see"" the other side in these situations. So much of his advice resulted in a lightbulb moment of ways that I've been manipulated in the past! Just having this knowledge makes me feel more comfortable with confrontation. Did I just confess my black swan?"

I learned a lot from the book. The author doesn’t pad the book with unnecessary fluff. He gets right to the point, gives clear examples, and uses bullet points to summarize the most important parts of each chapter. It’s an extremely readable guide that I can see myself referencing in the future. The author also tells stories of his time as an FBI hostage negotiator. I could not do that job. There’s too much pressure! The book mostly focuses on business negotiations where there is a lot of money at stake. Many of the author’s tips can be applied to any negotiation situation, but I wish he’d also talked about lower-stakes negotiations. I was hoping for more tips on dealing with difficult customers or family members. Even though the book didn’t give me everything I wanted, I’m eager to try out the author’s negotiation strategies.Do you like opinions, giveaways, and bookish nonsense? I have a blog for that."

It is good enough to prompt me to buy the book (I read my off a borrowed copy from library ) to try out and compare notes to see if it is effective.For those who are familiar with prospect theory, loss aversion and anchoring, it will not be too ground breaking but there are still good enough practical materials to digest and try to emulate.

The book is chock full of tips for negotiating all sorts of things. As indicated in the title, the strategies may seem counterintuitive, but, based on Voss's experience in business and in hostage negotiations, they work. The techniques would best be absorbed with practice, and Voss has included an appendix that includes a ""cheat sheet"" summarizing the main points."

314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127685079-carmen,Rating 5 out of 5,"Best non-fiction I've read in quite some time. Drawing from his firsthand experiences as the lead international kidnapping negotiator for the FBI, Voss weaves a compelling narrative filled with real-life examples. The specificity of his strategies, not only offers a glimpse into the high-stakes world of negotiation but also injects a thrilling quality into the book. The narratives range from encounters with military factions to confrontations with rebel kidnappers, and they revolve around scenarios of abduction, hostages, and armed fugitive bank robberies. These vivid examples not only explain the strategies in action but also prevent the book from becoming a dry excerpt on negotiation.The overarching lesson I took away from the book is a transformative perspective on life as a negotiation. Voss convincingly argues that whether navigating my career, managing finances, safeguarding my reputation, or navigating my love life, negotiation is an inherent part of all relationships. Understanding how to adeptly engage in conflict without causing harm is a valuable skill. A standout concept is the Ackerman model, which offers a step-by-step guide to the offer-counteroffer method. This model serves as a practical tool for navigating negotiations. I am eager to incorporate the principles and strategies I've learned into my daily life!"
