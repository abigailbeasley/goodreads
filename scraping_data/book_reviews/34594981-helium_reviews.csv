0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Tell me a story and let's laugh like it's the onlything keeping us alive.Play a songand give the stereopermission to use itsoutside voice.Let's sing loudly,offbeat and out of tune..Let the world knowwe don't care how it soundsbecause the only key we needis already in the ignition.""(from Drive)Poetry is indeed food for the soul. The cover of Rudy Francisco's first book of poems attracts immediate attention, but it is the poems that will slide into your thoughts and demand your attention. Divided into four sections, each roughly corresponds to a different theme. Section III was particularly good, with thoughts on race, gender and identity, deserving several reads. II is about the end of a relationship and was my least favorite. IV is perhaps about survival and hope, and I is about identity, various thoughts and falling in love, but you know how poetry is. His style reminds me a bit of Adrienne Rich; no particular rhyme or metre, with enough unused space to let you know each word is quite chosen. There are poems in the first section that feel a little too arch, a little too self-conscious, but not often. These are probably the ones that most benefit from performance.Still, he charmed me with 'Ouch':""Yesterday, I injured myselfand the explanation didn't make sense.I said, ""Well, I was walking...""and that was the end of the story.At this age,my body is a stranger that Ikeep meeting over and over again.""Skin II was one of the poems in the section on race that I found profound in imagery and parallels, perhaps a way for the unaware to understand the burden of racial representation.""When you are the only black manin the whole neighborhood,your skin is that one friend who meets everyone before you do.It wears a wife beaterand house shoes,it knocks over the neighbor's mailbox,it cusses in front of the kidsand plays the music too loudbut you actually don't doany of those things.""I also really loved Accentand how it connected culture with food:""My mother's accent isthe most popular brand of salt in her country.She gently sprinkles a little onevery word before she allowsthem to pass her lips.This is a ceremony that happensevery time she has something to say""It turns out Francisco gained fame as a spoken word poet. Here's a performance of his interesting, insightful and painful self-poem, 'My Honest Poem': https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=...It's very interesting, listening to the emotion and speed of his words, as I imagine them in a much deeper, slower cadence. There appears to be more humor than I would have expected, although perhaps the audience is just aware of rawness, and the laughs are uncomfortable, or supportive; I don't know. But I think I prefer the voice in my head. Two of the most moving poems in section III are on YouTube. 'Adrenaline Rush' takes a hard look at white privilege and gets a very deservedly hushed reception. It's an extremely powerful, truthful poem and his performance is riveting. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh09j... I loved The Heart and the Fist when I read it, but the performance was equally breathtaking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IHYA...One of the only modern poetry books I've been inspired to purchase. Highly recommended. Remaining on my 'currently reading' list so I can keep picking it up. Note: all poems quoted are partial, but unedited."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57797254-cindy,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’m not a big poetry reader but I thought Helium was fairly solid. Francisco’s style is very much an overload of metaphors, which people might get tired of but I personally enjoyed it. The way he pieces them together and gives anecdotes for double meanings makes the journey of going through each poem interesting. In particular, I appreciated the way he talks about the struggles of his black identity and realization of his toxic masculinity. The main caveat I had was that he often writes about women he barely knows as some ethereal creature (a girl he sees at Starbucks, a girl he’s in a FWB relationship with, etc). This makes him seem like another self-pitying male writer who overly romanticizes women and only likes the idea of them without actually knowing them. I prefer the poems where he's talking about or criticizing his own identity because that's actually grounded in what he knows about himself."

""My hobbies include: editing my life story, hiding behind metaphors, and trying to convince my shadow that I'm someone worth following.""
Wow, this was beautiful, the poems are so lyrical and have an emotional punch. This collection of poems discusses many social issues like sexism, racism, mental health, religion, etc. I especially love the poems about ""being black in America"" were very eye opening. Like this one here: 
""Being black is one of the most extreme sports in America. We don't need to invent new ways of risking our lives because the old ones have been working for decades.""
 I also love the poems about water and how scarce it is becoming, and wondering whether or not future generations will know water the same way we do. I also loved the romantic poems and the poems about his Mother. I especially liked this poem: 
""However, she makes everything feel like midnight. The streets are empty and her car is the only one on the road.""
I only knocked off a star because of some cliche-writing or cheesy poems that felt like they didn't belong in this collection, things like this: ""Cupid is irresponsible and I'm tired of him using me for target practice.""But other than that, I really loved it. This is a gorgeous collection of poems that is very beuatifully written and thought provoking."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7383561-holly,Rating 4 out of 5,"Like a lot of people, I really enjoyed Amanda Gorman's poem for Biden's Innauguration. It inspired me to pick up some poetry, starting with this!Most of the poems within aren't particularly long, and sometimes the shortest ones packed the most punch. For example here's the entire poem for ""How Did You Lose Her?"":I felt trapped,but another manlooked at my prisonand called her a church.Who would choose to be a jailwhen given the optionof being a sanctuary?See what I mean? This is sure to strike home for a lot of people. Most of the poems are longer than that, and certain parts really stood out to me. Especially this line from ""Rifle II"":...and isn't that what masculinity has become? A bunch of dudes afraid of their own feelings, terrified of any emotion other than anger, yelling at the shadows on the wall, but still haven't realized that we're the ones standing in front of the light.Now, I am not much for poetry generally, so I am not a connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination. But this collection felt very relatable and struck some chords in me. In particular, these are the poems I really enjoyed in the order that they appeared: How Did You Lose Her?To YouSkin II To the Man Standing on the Corner Holding the Sign That Said ""God Hates Gays""Rifle III Bet the Trees Are Thinking Mercy Complainers.I read just a couple of poems a day because I wanted to give myself time to really think on them, but you could read this whole thing easily in a day. So go ahead and pick this one up if you feel in the mood for trying out some poetry. I don't think you will be disappointed!"
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5460316-fiona,Rating 5 out of 5,"Edit: As amazing, as revelatory, and as earth-shakingly brilliant as this collection is, watching the author perform these poems is a new dimension altogether. Adrenaline Rush can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh09j...It's a shame it's only growing more relevant as time passes.Finally, finally - here's a poetry book that really lived up to the hype.Evocative and beautiful, this is a short collection but it packs a punch and covers a wide range of topics - there's a lot of love, from inception to infatuation to heartbreak, but the author isn't shy of straying into more political topics. Every word felt authentic and heartfelt. I'll be very interested to see what comes next."

9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32383826-kristy,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 StarsMy reflections on each part. IRudy Francisco is a ray of light with hopeful, humorous words and a positive outlook. There’s a light-hearted banter here that in no way diminishes the quality or meaning of his message.His poems still talk of new love, of a life unfinished, and of finding his way, but there is something refreshing about the way he writes.IIAs good as he is at writing about optimism, he’s even better at writing about loss. His poems Vanish, Scars, and Museum struck a cord with me. This section is bleak in the best way. Rudy’s able to look at or experience a situation and beautifully, sometimes metaphorically, emotionalize it. From the few spoken word videos of his I’ve seen, I wasn’t expecting this. But I loved it. IIII would call this the social issues section but that seems to trivialize how inspired and real these pieces are. Topics range from racism to masculinity and more. Rudy makes his experiences relatable, his thoughts coherent, and his verses flow in this section. IVA few last thoughts, a quick look at family, and a wrap up of a great collection of poetry."

I have had this collection recommended to me time and time again and it did not disappoint! The collection is split into four sections, each with a decidedly different tone but all incredibly thought-provoking and beautifully written. Rudy Francisco covers a range of topics and emotions from race to love, from sexism to imposter syndrome, and everything in-between. I loved every moment of the journey and this has definitely become one of my favourite poetry collections."

Instead, I'll leave you with this highlight: She has violin strings for legs, a graveyard of awkward treble clefs buried in her knees and I can see the suffering inside of the concert of her walk. 🖕🏻I mean, Francisco's got a good shot at winning next year's middle school poetry slam, so there's that."

This is what I get for not keeping up with the poetry circuit, I suppose. Helium popped up in my GR updates feed with a cover that made me look twice, and an endorsement in the review that had me kicking up a trail of dust in my fast-track to the library. It’s just as good as promised.Rudy Francisco’s work is clear and incisive. He wields his words like razor blades, cutting away to the core of all those moments in our lives that catch the light and say “Here I am. This is true. Notice me.”This is poetry that’s meant to be read out loud. Take your time. Savor it. It’s kind of like a breath-mint for society’s ills. Or maybe just a well-deserved slap. Depends on the poem.Alright, I’ll stop torturing you with bad similes. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go buy a copy of this for myself."

27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66286765-anna,No Rating,"Rudy Francisco is a black spoken-word poet from San Diego. His book has about sixty poems, a mix of longer poems (about 1-3 pages) with quick 1-2 line poems. This is love poetry—sensual passages dot the text. This is also no-holds-barred protest poetry. It made me say “F**k yes.”Yet from the first page, I was also chuckling. The book has genuine laughs, and some poems have creative points of view—for example, “the day has been asking about you.” Reading the whole thing was an experience—the poems are carefully ordered, and you can see the narrator’s growth from the first poem to the last poem. Early in the book, after a couple of love poems, I made a note to myself: “These poems felt somewhat generic—about how woman makes the poet feel, not about her in any specifics…” But—hang in there, reader! The narrator figures this out about himself, too.The narrator’s growing into a different man. He figures out (in my words, not his) that he’s been taught to treat women as interchangeable. “We often forget that sexism is a family heirloom that we’ve been passing down for generations,” he notes. For his own sake, as well as the sake of women, the narrator strives to live differently.Some favorite poems: “To You,” “And Then After,” “Skin II,” “Liberty” (just—wow), “Rifle II,” “In the Voice of Hip-Hop,” “Strong,” and “I Bet the Trees Are Thinking.” Francisco is writing about experiences of anxiety and depression (though he uses those labels sparingly) and the specific anxieties of blackness and masculinity.Read “My Honest Poem” to learn about Mr. Francisco’s personal story. Read the poem “To You,” about how sexism gaslights women, to its phenomenal last line.Francisco’s main metaphor is water. Water kills and drowns. It’s to be feared, as water or love. Helium (words? hot air from love poems? for sure, the book title) is escape, a way to break the surface of toxic masculinity—firmly entangled with racism—and breathe. Water is old, sexist ways. (I’m still admiring the line, “I held you the way a boat holds water.”) Water might be people in general. Water causes anxiety, or it is also anxiety. Waves are water and an outdated (hair) style for black men. Yet water is also scarce and disappearing, as in California droughts worsened by climate change. It’s precious, as in a half-empty glass. Drink or you’ll die, because water is life.And read, read, read.Bonus quotes from HELIUM, by Rudy Francisco…“When I was six years old, my brother and my cousins tried to teach me how to swim… I remember them pulling me from the jaws of the liquid beast before it could devour me whole. That was the day I almost lost my life. To anyone brave enough to love me, Do you know the human body is approximately sixty percent water? When I walk into a room full of people, all I see is an ocean.”“Get out of bed. The day has been asking about you.”“At this age, my body is a stranger that I keep meeting over and over again.”“every year, the past tense finds a larger house inside the neighborhood of my everyday vernacular.”“My hobbies include: editing my life story”“I put mistakes inside a belt and make them tools, how I look the machine in the face, call it unfinished, call it beautiful and give it my name.”“every time I try to write about love, my hands cramp just to show me how painful love can be and sometimes, pencils break just to prove that every now and then, love takes a little more work than planned.”“I would massage your back until your skin sings songs”“want to know how I got these scars? I swallowed my pride. It clawed its way out of my mouth.”“When you choose to be a poet, you become a place that people walk through and then leave when they are ready.”“Courage has never been a chameleon’s best attribute and some days, it’s not mine either. I was mentored by black men with brown skin who turned yellow at the sight of bellies swollen with half their DNA. I was taught that a woman’s vagina is just an underground railroad to masculinity, that real men have tunnel vision and treat girls like subway cars, like nothing more than a space to parallel park our genitals, a hole to bury seeds and leave orchards…”“This is an apology to every woman I changed colors just to get inside of. I still haven’t stumbled across a definition of a man, but I know that we are hotels that stand a million war stories tall.”“When you are the only black man in the whole neighborhood, your skin is that one friend who meets everyone before you do.”“Volcano surfing… When I heard about this activity, I thought to myself, it must be nice to feel so safe, you have to invent new ways to put yourself in danger.”“Being black is one of the most extreme sports in America. We don’t need to invent new ways of risking our lives…”“In 1983, illusionist David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty disappear. He placed a curtain in front of the monument and when he pulled it down the 3,000-foot statue was no longer there. I think about how this magic trick has become too familiar. Liberty just vanishing without any explanations.”“I bet your God watches FOX news…”“you are praying to your own shadow”“tell your God that my God is looking for him.”“I wonder how long it took to convince the first rifle that it could hold a note instead of a bullet, but still fire into a crowd and make everyone move.”“we learn that the heart is the same size as the fist, but we keep forgetting they don’t have the same functions. We keep telling each other to man up when we don’t even know that means. We turn our boys into bayonets…”“I am learning that the difference between a garden and a graveyard is only what you choose to put in the ground. One day, I came across a picture of a strange-looking violin. The caption said it was made out of a rifle and I was like, someday that can be me.”“So I’ve never caught a live grenade with my bare hands. So I don’t know exactly how it feels, but I imagine it’s a lot like getting a text that says, ‘Hey, we really need to talk.’”“she said, ‘I’m going into labor.’ My initial thought was, I don’t know much about unions, but that seems like a good idea.”"

And still, I'm so glad to have read this book.The book is divided into four sections that don't have an specific name or them but I decided to group together according to the things they made me feel.Part I is about a shattered man and how he's hurting and dealing with the pain in his daily life. It felt so personal and I found myself deeply connected to the author through his poetry.""I take my compliments the same way I take my coffee. I don’t drink coffee"" from Sip.Part II is about an ended relationship and a broken heart. This one felt too personal almost like getting into somebody's mind. I wasn't that comfortable about that experience but managed to keep going because the poems are beautiful.""I found you, looking like a damaged wine glass. I hugged your shatter. I cut all of my fingers trying to jigsaw puzzle you back together. When it was over, you looked at the stains on the carpet and blamed me for making a mess."" from MessPart III is probably my favorite one, is a big slap in the face of reality that we tend to try and forget. It's about war, violence, racism, the environment, the author manages them flawlessly and although I loved every poem they were also terrifying because it's a nightmare to open your eyes and realize that the monsters are still there.""I wonder if my grandkids will ever throw a penny in a fountain and hear it splash."" from RoulettePart IV is about forgiveness and peace, sending a never ending meassage of hope that reminds me all the good things in the world, and as long as they're here, we will keep fighting.“You are still alive.” You are still alive.

Rudy Francisco writes straightforward, vulnerable poetry that could best be described as ‘well-intentioned sucker punches’.Francisco addresses his own struggles in this collection, at times self-deprecating, at others so unflinchingly honest it feels uncomfortable to read:I have an odd fascination with sandcastles and ice sculptures: things that will only last a few moments. That’s also why I fall in love with women who will never love me back.Especially the poems tackling social issues - racism and sexism - were heart-breaking and eye-opening.I know that we carry guitar cases full of phobias hoping we can turn fear into our strongest instrument, I know that our hands break things just as frequent as we can fix them.

As men, it is important that we start asking ourselves, What will the boys learn from us?It’s frightening how on-point Francisco describes issues of masculinity and sexism in our society. He does not shy away from calling out the perpetuation of toxic masculinity:I had no idea what class this was but I did know I was passing and isn’t that what masculinity has become? A bunch of dudes afraid of their own feelings, terrified of any emotion other than anger, yelling at the shadows on the wall, but still haven’t realized that we’re the ones standing in front of the light.Francisco also addresses how others keep searching for the next adrenaline kick, the craziest challenge, the punch of fear mixed with excitement while he is forced to fear for his life every day because of racism:Being black is one of the most extreme sports in America. We don’t need to invent new ways of risking our lives because the old ones have been working for decades.It seems that no matter what issue he tackles, Francisco scores with raw commentary that resonates. This was such an insightful poetry collection, brutally honest and heart-wearming at the same time. I definitely recommend checking out Rudy Francisco on YouTube if you're interested in his poetry!*I received an ARC from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review, so thank you so much*"

With Helium, it took me a while to warm up to it. The first few pieces revolved around the author’s perception of love and his relationship experiences, which I couldn’t really connect with in a meaningful way. I think it’s mainly because of my own preferences — simply put, I think literature is already oversaturated with poems about love and heartbreak, so I don’t have the stomach to fully appreciate them. However, as the pieces became more reflective of his struggles as a person of color and as a person facing deteriorating mental health, my reading experience with Helium drastically improved. After reading this book, I searched for Rudy Francisco’s live performances online. Personally, I think his works are better delivered orally, instead of in the written word. Watching his live performances made me realize that some of the essence and power behind his words were lost in the process of transferring them into book form, which is a shame. But I think this unavoidably happens to all spoken word artists who try to publish their poetry.Nonetheless, despite my rocky start, I really enjoyed reading Helium, especially the poems that touched on Blackness and toxic masculinity and privilege. I appreciated the use of accessible language in all his poetry. I liked how the author effortlessly alternated between declarative and reflective tones in a way that really provokes thought from the reader. I loved Rudy Francisco’s bluntness and his messy metaphors that inexplicably made sense. Helium is a remarkable poetry book for a debut author.Recommended! (4 stars)Content and trigger warnings:References to sexual assault, loss, police brutality, abuse. Topics of racism and generational trauma.* I received a digital ARC of this book (via NetGalley) from its publisher in exchange for an honest review."

""I’m still learninghow to whisper, I’m loud in placeswhere I should be quiet, I’m quietin places where I should be loud.""

 This is by far the best poetry collection that I've read this year, and I think that's saying something since I don't really dig reading these types. To be honest, Helium really didn't appeal to me that much in the first 15 pages more or less because it leaned more on the author's poetic inclination to heartbreak. As a NBSB individual it's kind of cringy and too insulting for my fragile ego. Kidding ahhahahaha! They're actually written well but we're too repetitive at times which is why I suddenly felt like giving this up. However, as it progressed this book turned out to be so much more than a poetry collection of heartbreak! It skirted a lot of relevant themes without glossing over them. You can also find messages on casual to extreme racism, lawless violence, toxic masculinity, depression, and the rediscovery of love. I can't count how many times I shouted in approval at the amount of shade present in this book. Here are some of my favorite quotes! 

""My hobbies include: editing my life story,hiding behind metaphors,and trying to convince my shadowthat I’m someone worth following""""You cracked hourglasswith sand spilling from behind your ribs.You wasted my time.How dare you linger on my lipsand then kiss me like a stuttering apologywith excuses stapled to the roof of your mouth""""No one ever asks a museumif it’s doing okay.So when you choose to spill like this,bleed like this, cry like this,your pain becomes an exhibit""""And we often forget that sexismis a family heirloom that we’ve been passing down for generations.As men, it is important that we start asking ourselves,What will the boys learn from us?""""Being black is one of the most extreme sports in America.""""We turn our boys into bayonets,point them in the wrong direction,pull their triggers and fail to acknowledgeall the damage they are doing in the distance.""

SilenceI’m learningthat I don’t alwayshave to make noiseto be seen,that even my silencehas a spine, a rumbleand says, I’m herein its native tongue. 
The first time I heard about the book was when I watched a video of Rudy Francisco perform 'Complainers' on a stage years back. His spoken poetry was really heavy and touching, and so I immediately had the urge to hunt for this book.Helium is collection of poems and short essays that dwelled on his life, relationships, the aspects pf toxic masculinity, racism, and the concept of being your adult self. His theme was conventional yet powerful, because you could feel its very own entity seep into your mind as you go through the poems. I love his style of writing. My favorite pieces are Silence, Complainers, and Yes. It is a brave choice for contemporary poets to stray away from the traditional style of poem writing, and it is rare for them to keep up the charm in their works. The collection is a bit short and not categorized in a certain way except for its four chapters, so it feels like you can have a taste of every theme that this book has to offer."

Some of the metaphors Francisco used were stunning and the images he paints are incredibly vivid, and, at times, ethereal. However, I did feel that this book was a tale of two halves - I thoroughly enjoyed each and every poem up until section III, where a few sounded a bit too preachy and accusatory for my liking. I actually found his shorter poems to be the most hard-hitting and punchier whilst the lengthier poems failed to drive home the same impact. Overall, a great debut collection and I’m very much looking forward to seeing what lyrical musings Mr Francisco conjures up in the future! "

It started really strong and I marked many things at the beginning, but then the rest of the book was not as good but still good. you know?The first poem (Water) was my favourite. Also, what really attracted my attention that the book is not Romance heavy. There are few romantic poems, but most of them were about other topics which was refreshing to see in a poetry book to be honest.Water When I was six years old,my brother and my cousins tried to teach me how to swim. They did this by throwing me into a pool. Immediately, my arms became two skinny brown flailing distress signals. I think I heard my brother say, “If he dies, I’m going to be in so much trouble.” I remember them pulling me from the jaws of the liquid beast before it could devour me whole. That was the day I almost lost my life. To anyone brave enough to love me, Do you know the human body is approximately sixty percent water? When I walk into a room full of people, all I see is an ocean.Other parts I liked:HorizonI hope I haven’t already driven past my greatest moments. I hope there is something beautiful on the horizon that’s just as impatient as I am. Something so eager, it wants to meet me halfway. A moment that is diligently staring at its watch, trembling with nervousness, frustrated, and bursting at the seams, wondering what’s taking me so long to arrive. CapacityToday, I’m trying to perfect the art of enjoying my own company.I am exercising isolation and letting it flex in front of the mirror like my proudest muscle. Some days, it’s just me by myself, the room is at capacity and there is nothing more enticing than silence.YesAnd sometimes it all arrives at once. The anxiety, the fear,the voices that scratch your confidence like a chalkboard and somehow all the oxygen in the room suddenly becomes water and you begin to wonder if you have what it takes to grow gills. You wonder if you can blend in with the fish. You wonder if you will ever breathe again. And the answer is not every building that shakes will collapse. The answer is not everything that chipswill crumble. The answer is this is temporary and yes, you will.""...Relationships remind me that I’m not afraid of heights or falling, but I’m afraid of what’s going to happen when my body hits the ground. I’m clumsy. Yesterday I tripped over my self-esteem, landed on my pride and it shattered like an iPhone with a broken face...""""...I’ve got a hamper full of really loud mistakes and a graveyard in my closet.

Rudy Francisco shares his thoughts and feelings in a stunning open, honest and sometimes raw manner. He has a breathtaking way with words that kept blowing me away. I was impressed by his analogies, for me they were the most striking aspect of his poems. He has an impressive ability to compare, voice his opinions and show his emotions with clarity while adding an abundance of beauty in the process. His poems give his readers a fascinating glance into his world and I'm grateful I had the chance to experience this.Rudy Francisco skillfully plays with rhythm. Every time he gets it exactly right, which gives his poems plenty of strength. He makes sure the reader understands the message and is being spellbound by the way he delivers it at the same time. Helium is a gorgeous collection of poems, it contains small masterpieces that can and should be read again and again. I highly recommend this fantastic work of art."

And with some poems he only needs 13 words to convey such insight and impact and I found myself re-reading some as they just struck me as so engaging.There were poems that were short and snappy, alongside those that went more in depth into a wide range of emotions and it has definitely made me more interested in the new world of poetry and will be searching out more to read in the future - I just hope they're all as good as this!!"

I was waiting to the day them to call me to read. Rudy Francisco is one of the most amazing spoken word poets I ever listen to. And now I finished Helium, I enjoyed it as much as same. I’m saying that cuz’ English is not my native language, and listening and reading are completely different things. He voices things like love, life, race, status, gender, identity, discrimination, existing,,, from family, himself, lovers, politics, people, neighborhood, culture, time, relationships,,, Depictions are beautiful, every metaphor is worth to be reread. It’s honest, straightforward, powerful, vulnerable, drastic... You don’t have to be gay, black, american, millennial, etc. to feel these poems. As much as it’s personal, also political yet not a statement. Not an oration, but advice. There is an affirmative tone, thank god not like inspirational / motivating quotes or dashboard feed updates people out there called ‘poems’ (I’m sorry guys, I do love minimal poetry, but this is not the case here.) And realllllyyyyy looveeed ‘Horizon’,’ Chameleon’, ‘To You’, ‘Rifle II’, ‘Roulette’ but I'm in love with ‘My Honest Poem’, ‘When People Ask How I’m Doing’, ‘Scars’, ‘Lopsided’, ‘To the Man Standing on the Corner Holding the Sign That Said “God Hates Gays”’. That goddamn poem called ‘Again’ (aka ‘Looking For You’)… Every time I listen to this poem I swear I cry. Not just one of the most beautiful ‘love’ poems. Historical / mythical elements he wisely uses as imagery are also universal long-lasting matters. you can listen here and read below.
[...] We lived in Egypt, I was the Pharaoh's slave, you were his daughter. Loving you led to my death, they claimed that I seduced you, and after they stole my life, I was resurrected as a mason. I made the foundation for your house. We met eyes for two seconds, you left, and I didn’t see you again until I died. I came back as a caterpillar. I turned into a butterfly, I landed in the palm of your hands, you brushed me away, and the rejection killed me. When I awoke, I was a kick drum, you were a snare, we were both owned by this drummer named Cozy Cole, and when he died, so did we. But I came back just to look for you. I left notes in random places, hoping that you would stumble across them. I carved our names in trees, and then prayed that it would jog your memory. I whispered your name in the wind, hoping somehow, maybe some way, my voice would reach you, but it didn’t, and I died. I died early. I died young with breadcrumbs in my hand just hoping that you would find me, but you never did, so they buried me. And when they buried me, they put these coins over my eyes, and I used them as bus fare to get back to Earth, just so I can look for you.
BTW. Hozier the forest god’s song ""From Eden"" reminds me this poem or the poem does it idk. Though Hozier defines slightly different, basically the song is about the satan who fall from heaven ‘cause of his impossible love, and I cry every fucking time when I listen to.“Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago / Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword / Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know / I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door”Let it get u highxoxoxoiko"

He also addressed toxic masculinity and how males (I have decided not to call them men, personal choice) are so afraid of their emotions and feelings that they only rely on anger and hatred because they are afraid of appearing weak.I enjoyed this and I hope you check it out."

I had such conflicting thoughts on it, that I forced myself to sit back, and to ask myself what I had problems with it. And, when I really thought about it, my main problem was the organization. Otherwise, I found the poems to be thought provoking and meaningful, and my e-copy of the book is very heavily highlighted. I actually ended up using a stanza as my senior quote this year, which I wasn't even expecting.So, with the organization, the book was separated into chunks, parts, and there were four of them. The sections had no defined theme, and I found some of them to vary around, or even repeat themes that were already discussed. I didn't mind the poems, oh no, it's just that I didn't get what Francisco was getting at. What was really frustrating was how there were sections that had clear themes (like the second one focused on Francisco's relationship with a woman), but then others would jump all over the place.I found the rest of the collection enthralling. Some of the poems were really inspirational and hard-hitting and I wanted more of that. Like I said, I ended up using a stanza as my senior quote, just because I found myself relating so much to his words. There were some poems that I really didn't care for (like the ones about his relationship. But, that's me, personally), but otherwise I wanted more poems like that. Francisco kind of made me look at poetry differently, because I've only ever seen two types of poetry before this: stuff that tries to be all deep and meaningful and just turns out to be a jumble of words, or poems thatreadlikethis,one word at a time, not really making these words anything more than words. Francisco changed that though. Poems can still be meaningful but not a jumble of words. Poems don't have to be one word a line to make sense either.Four stars - Overall?For a book that I randomly chose off NetGalley, I'm really impressed! While I personally had struggles with the organization, and disliked a few of the poems, I overall found myself enjoying the collection and am interested in reading more of Rudy Francisco's works!Would I Recommend?If you like poetry, I would totally suggest this one!

73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5228445-ariana,Rating 5 out of 5,"Originally posted on: The Quirky Book Nerd*I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review*I absolutely loved this collection of poetry. Short but sweet, Francisco’s words are beautiful and evoke a myriad of emotions. His writing flows beautifully and depicts each poem’s deepest meanings in vivid detail. It is impossible not to become wrapped up by each phrase and carried through each and every page. He uses his great talent for words—for memorably phrasing his thoughts—to raise awareness about elements of conflict and trouble we currently deal with in society. It is wonderful to see writers attacking these issues and trying to reach a wider audience in such a creative way.This is one of those collections that truly stands out to me because, while it fits very well with the work we see in the poetry genre these days, it has a little something extra to it. It does focus on common topics such as love and heartbreak, but it defines itself as even more unique and different than that. Francisco does not shy away from discussing social issues and these are the poems where we as readers will feel the most. His words are raw and fearless, upfront and honest, meaningful and utterly powerful. They spoke to me greatly, as I am sure they will to many other readers.Every poem contains a strong and important message that truly packs a punch and is sure to stick with the reader long after completing the collection. Francisco speaks on topical and significant subjects, such as racism, sexism, and mental health—subjects for which constant discussion is crucial. He brings attention to these things through lyrical and absorbing prose that activates the mind and envelopes the soul. I found these poems to be incredibly impactful, thought-provoking, and a fantastic use of this literary platform. I very highly recommend giving this collection a read and I am personally beyond eager to read more of Francisco’s work in the future."

There was some nice prose and imagery here at times, but on the whole, I found that the collection had rather a juvenile feel to it. There were a lot of cliches within some of the poems, and it felt a little lacking for my personal taste. The poems about race were definitely the strongest in the collection, and offer interesting perspectives on difference and similarities."

I liked it a lot and wished there was more to read and think about. I highlighted many parts and would definitely recommend this.I had some small issues. The poems are divided in four sections, but it read like those dividers didn't matter at all. As if they didn't exist and this was just a book of poems without organisation. Sometimes I noticed themes, but then they came back in other places when I thought they were already done. I couldn't tell you what my favourite part was, because it feels pretty jumbled.There was a poem I interpreted to be about sex with a woman outside of a romantic relationship which ended with ""most men are proud of things like this."" For a collection that shows in other works to be against toxic masculinity, I felt this was too much of a generalisation. Too much of a divide between ""normal men"" and the ""good guys."" But, as mentioned, this is just my interpretation, and it's that specific interpretation and the meaning I attach to it I didn't like.The poem To the Man Standing on the Corner Holding the Sign That Said ""God Hates Gays"" also had both great and questionable lines. Mainly the use of mental illnesses or medical issues as description for something bad didn't sit well with me. I'm still debating if the ableism in that will make me change my rating to 3 stars.I noticed, in this collection and the other modern poetry collections I recently read, that poems about love (or more specifically, loss of love and heartbreak) don't really make me feel anything. I'm relatively indifferent towards them. So those, again, didn't blow me away, but the others were great. And that's obviously a ""it's not you, it's me"" thing.I loved the hope in a lot of the poems. The imagery of repurposed guns and grenades. The flowers and the sun. The mildness you are allowed to treat yourself with. And some poems made me feel like a summer day with friends.The poem I quoted above will be part of my new years' resolutions. The self-reflection and the growth that can come from it, but also the forgiveness. I can't wait to read this poem again in a year and feel the progress I made.A great collection talking about hope, love, race, culture, and more, with an honest sense of critique and self-reflection. Thanks to Netgalley for providing me with an e-arc in exchange for an honest review."

But what exactly do you do on days when it feels like the hands on your clock have arthritis?”- Rudy FranciscoGoing into this, I didn’t really know what I was expecting, but I did know I wanted to familiarize myself with a different genre. Poetry is constantly ridiculed by those who don’t understand the beauty of words, and I myself am guilty of this. Some of the pieces included in this project were no more than a couple of sentences, but they spoke to me the most. In reading this book, I realized how underappreciated this type of writing is, but also how absolutely powerful just a string of words can be. I realized that words can unite, influence, and connect people. Although many of you reading this may be opposed to even picking up a book like this, open your mind, and give poetry a try. It’s a delightful collection of short reads that touches upon topics such as self-image, sexism, racism, and heartbreak. Compilation of my favorite quotes:“I know that we carry guitar cases full of phobias hoping we can turn fear into our strongest instrument”“They say you have to peel a woman like a tangerine and your job as a man is to chameleon yourself into her trees, bite a piece of her fruit and leave the rest hanging crooked and confused. This is an apology to every woman I changed colors just to get inside of.”“Most days, I know how to grab my voice by the handle and swing it like a hammer, but instead, i picked it up like a shard of glass, scared of what might happen if I didn’t hold it carefully”“I convinced my fist that it was a flower. It relaxed, it bloomed and I forgave you before you even apologized.”"

I Picked Up This Book Because:
 I ran across the poet randomly on Facebook and have been stalking (what I thought was one poem it’s actually 3 in this book) ever since.
The Characters:
 
The Story:
Part I:Rudy insists he is not a love poet in one of his works in this part, If I Was a Love Poet. Rudy is a liar. It has taken me days to get through part one because the notions that he puts forth through his words have been enough to shock me into stillness and a need to reflect on said words. If I can’t be loved half as well as this I’m going to be single forever. (I was already going to be single forever I shouldn’t put that weight on these words) Part II: The major theme in part 2 is heartbreak. Relationships that have gone awry. The thoughts and ideas are just as poignant and thoughtful as part one. Part III:Life. I am blown away.Part IV:I am in awe of the talent represented on these pages. I’d like to wallpaper a room with these poems.

Francisco’s poems on race touched me deeply, and they were also the best, in my opinion. I was incredibly moved.I really enjoyed the metaphors in this collection - they were beautifully executed - and Francisco undeniably has a way with words. A lot of these poems had passages that I thought were excellent even if the poem itself didn’t always blow me away.As I find with most poetry, every work, every line, every word is completely hit or miss. While most of these poems did have parts that really hit, a fair amount of them didn’t.I also found some of the poems about women misogynistic in a way that I think corresponds with the societal view of women, which impacted my overall enjoyment.Star ratings of the four sections:I = 3 starsII = 3.5 starsIII = 4.5 starsIIII = 4 stars"

I marked so many pages in this book I might as well have just marked the entire book. These poems are great! I think it especially made the difference that I've heard Francisco read some of his pieces before too. You can really feel the passion through his words. These poems are pulsating stanza's built with charged words. Except, even more. I think some of my particular favorites are the ones with the long titles, like ""To the girl who works at Starbucks Down the Street from my House on Delmont Heights Road, I swear to God I'm not a stalker."" Not, only are those long titles great humorously, but what follows them just blows you out of the water.This won't be my last Francisco book and I highly recommend anyone looking into this. "

It's crazy how you can relate to someone who has a vastly different life and mind and journey from yours. It's crazy and it's beautiful, and...that's poetry.

There are some about anxiety, about race, about discrimination, about emotions, about expectations, there are some about love and my personal favs, the ones about life and day to day.

I went home and watched some of his other performances and decided I was a fan. It wasn’t until I was scrolling through my library’s “Selected books for National Poetry Month” that I learned Rudy Francisco had a book of poetry. I checked it out. These poems had so many of the things I enjoyed from Mr. Francisco’s spoken word: honesty, humor, and lines crafted so well you have to read them at least three times before you get over the awe. I used to think I didn’t really like poetry that much, but I do. It’s special, and it’s tough, and I’m thankful for the people who can spin their emotions into words that keep coming back to you."

I couldn't help but feel as though I was sitting down to a meal as I read this. The book is divided into four parts; the first is to whet your appetite with poems like Good Morning and Page (which I relate to because I face blank pages every morning when I sit down to write), the second part is more like when your family starts asking your date questions. They simply want to know a bit more about your date. The third part is the main dish. This is where your folks make it clear to your date that if they are not here to stay they'd better excuse themselves from the dinner table and leave for good. I'll say Adrenaline Rush, 98, Liberty and Brother and if you do not get it then To the Man Standing in the Corner Holding the Sign That Said ""God Hates Gays"" packs a punch, he starts out by pointing out the ironies of life and flaws in our opinions and closes by  I want you to tell your God that my God is looking for him. The final part is the dessert and in total you've got 17, 16, 17, 8 poems from each part respectively.I'm off to check out his performances on YouTube.Thank you NetGalley and Button Poetry books for sharing this awesome book with me, now, I need more of the author's works and I hear that YouTube is a good place start.

Admito que sólo decidí leerlo porque ví que era uno de los libros favoritos de Olivia Rodrigo, y aún cuando ví que era un poemario decidí darle una oportunidad. No me arrepientoRudy Francisco tiene una forma muy especial de expresarse, sus metáforas van de lo sencillo hasta un poco más complicado, de igual forma son bastante interesantes y acertadas.No seré buena criticando poesía, pero este libro me hizo sentir muchas cosas, pude verme en algunos poemas, mientras en otros veía a amigos, o la sociedad en sí. Muchas veces sentí un vuelco en el corazón y ganas de llorar, y creo que éso es lo que importa“I’ll tell you.I got these scarsthe day I fell in love with you.”“My brain is a revolverwith “Am I good enough?”in every chamber.”“Do you know the human body is approximatelysixty percent water? When I walk into a roomfull of people, all I see is an ocean.”“I’m still learninghow to whisper, I’m loud in placeswhere I should be quiet, I’m quietin places where I should be loud"""
137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47685808-roza,Rating 3 out of 5,"I'm still not getting the hang of spoken word poetry. This is a promising genre and I myself am hopeful that it will reconnoiter the adoration of poetry in a generation, where appreciation for poetry has waned over the years. The first two parts of the collection in question hasn’t moved me much, the lyrical quality hasn’t bloomed in the verses. But I really digged the third part, almost made me remember Maya Angelou's writing style (that is a huge complement in case you have been introduced to her poems). The fourth part was pretty good too.Overall, I'll rate this 3.3/5. The slight shift from average rating is obviously not indicating the incompetence of this collection because I think among popular poetry collections, this might be my favourite. The account of coloured folks, inclusion of equality for all and acknowledgement of regular emotions- so many ways to relate to these poems."

Helium


I Picked Up This Book Because:
 The publisher had a 50% off sale so I jumped at the chance to hear Mr Francisco speak his work 
The Story:
Unlike the printed work the audiobook is not separated into parts. In fact if you are not paying attention one poem flows into another with barely a pause sometimes. Although I enjoyed hearing the poems I will say I expected more passion in the works like you hear in his performances on YouTube. Most poems are delivered in a calm concise way although there are a few moments you can tell he wanted to give it his all. Overall I still enjoyed the poems and hope I will find myself listening to them often as I find many aspects different in each experience. 
The Random Thoughts:

The poems collected here speak of life, love, and thoughtful observation.“Page” is probably the best poem I have read, or at least one of the best, that tackles the role of the writer.“Instructions” offers sage advice, packed into the brief space of a little more than a page and arranged in stanzas that seem comfortably formed.There is much to discover in the volume, a delight for this lover of poetry and sure to be a delight for others."

While watching the video there was one line that stood out to me the most. ""I want to be your ex-boyfriend's stunt man. I want to do everything he never had the courage to do."" So once he said that I was hooked, I looked him up on google and discovered that he had a book coming out and I knew I had to grab it. This book was everything I needed and wanted. The different parts of this book key in on different subjects that all flow into one amazing book."

Rudy writes so beautifully about depression, love (or lack thereof), forgiveness, self-love - all from the perspective of a black man living in America.“Volcano surfingis a sport in which a personrides down an active volcanoat speeds up to 50 miles per hourusing nothing but a wooden board.When I heard about this activity,I thought to myself,it must be nice to feel so safe,you have to invent new ways toput yourself in danger.When the bodythinks it may be swallowing its last breath,the adrenal glands release hormones into the blood,the skin becomes a cocktail of sweat and fear,the heart gets claustrophobic,the lungs become newlywedsholding hands in a crashing airplane.This is called an adrenaline rush.I was 18 when I started driving.I was 18 the first time I was pulled over.It was 2 am on a Saturday.The officer spilled his lights all over my rearview mirror,he splashed out of the car with his hand already on his weapon,and looked at me the way a tsunami looks at a beach house.Immediately, I could tell he was the kind of manwho brings a gun to a food fight.He called me sonand I thought to myself,that’s an interesting way of pronouncing “boy.”He asks for my license and registration,wants to know what I’m doing in this neighborhood,if the car is stolen,if I have any drugsand most days, I know how to grab my voiceby the handle and swing my voice like a hammer.But instead,I picked it up like a shard of glass.Scared of what might happen if I didn’t hold it carefullybecause I know that this much melaninand that uniform is a plotline to a film thatcan easily end with a chalk outline baptism,me trying to make a body bag look stylish for the cameraand becoming the newest coat in a closet full of RIP hashtags.Once, a friend of a friend asked mewhy there aren’t more black people in the X Gamesand I said, “You don’t get it.”Being black is one of the most extreme sports in America.We don’t need to invent new ways of risking our livesbecause the old ones have been working for decades.Jim Crow may have left the nest,but our streets are still covered with its feathers.Being black in America is knowing there’s a thin linebetween a traffic stop and the cemetery,it’s the way my body tenses upwhen I hear a police siren in a song,it’s the quiver in my stomach when a cop car is behind me,it’s the sigh of relief when I turn right and he doesn’t.I don’t need to go volcano surfing.Hell, I have an adrenaline rush every time an officerdrives right past without pulling me overand I realizeI’m going to make it home safe.This time.”"

159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1517593-tom-c,Rating 3 out of 5,"These are youthful poems that will appeal to young readers and those who haven't read a lot of poetry beforehand. Give this book to any young poets who specialize in breakup poems. Francisco can teach them how to write breakup poems right. He is a master of surprising metaphors, personification, and similes (e.g. ""as if you were a broken sunset with a lazy sky on your shoulders"" and ""Hoping these words will be the //fire hydrant on your street corner and you will run/through my stories like sprinklers...""). In this he reminds me of Hera Lindsay Bird, another young poet making big waves in the poetry world. But sometimes he's a bit careless with his metaphors. Here's an entire poem:SinkingI held youthe way a boat holds water.I should have left when Ifelt us sinking.This doesn't make sense. In stanza one, the poem's auditor is compared to water. In stanza, both the speaker and the auditor are sinking. But Rudy, water doesn't sink; water is the stuff that things sink in.Francisco's poems are very clear, and the sentiments in them are often honest and sweet, though not particularly original. He comes out boldly against toxic masculinity, racism, and hateful street preachers -- all ground that's already been paved by other thinkers. The effect is that you nod, true, true, I know, I know. I'd rather read someone who has things to tell me that I didn't already know.Often Francisco uses a lot more syllables than necessary, a vice in any kind of writing but especially in poetry. For example:""Mealin a reoccuringnightmare,there is a pack of rabid bulletssmelling one of my old t-shirts,hungryand salivatingat the scent. ...""This could be leaner and still say as much:MealIn a reoccurringnightmarea pack of rabid bulletssmells one of myold t-shirts,hungry, salivating...""""A pack of rabid bullets smells"" (six words, eight syllables) says the same thing as ""there is a pack of rabid bullets smelling"" (eight words, eleven syllables). The comma between ""hungry"" does the same work as the word ""and"", and ""at the scent is completely redundant. The bullets had already smelled his shirt. No one reading thought that they were hungry and salivating over anything other than the scent.Nitpicks aside, this is an honest, clear young poet with a wonderful knack for figurative language."
160,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20208526-francesca,Rating 5 out of 5,"*I was given an ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review* Although Rudy Francisco’s Helium begins tentatively, cautiously inviting the reader into the author’s vulnerability, this book crescendos and packs a poetic punch. Francisco explores racism, sexism, childhood, love, and even climate change. Most poems were deeply moving and beautiful, with a few light and humorous pieces thrown in. I was touched to read poetry by a male author that was absent of any pretension. We get to know Francisco in his rawest form and the result is fascinating. The author brilliantly and seamlessly leads us into deeper and darker places once he has established himself as sincere and genuine in part 1. Francisco writing is as lyrical as it is candid.Francisco’s poetry collection has arrived at a critical time in our country’s history. He urges men to teach their sons to treat women respectfully and addresses the concept of toxic masculinity in “Chameleon” and “Rifle II”. In the especially timely and heart-wrenching poem, “Adrenaline Rush,” Francisco addresses the terror he feels when he is pulled over by a cop as a Black man in America. I appreciated that the book ended on an inspirational note with reminders of gratitude and encouragement to face our fears regardless of anxiety. This collection is a series of contradictions in the best way possible. The work is soft, yet bold; self-deprecating at times, yet critical of the culture that has shaped the author. I very much look forward to more of Francisco’s work. "
161,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/374456-kerri-anne,Rating 3 out of 5,"We have a gifted CD we listen to regularly that has a spoken-word poem by Rudy Francisco on it, and it's gorgeous: the way his voice sings his poems off the page. There are moments of brilliance here, for sure, but for me there were also some big misses. (Which maybe just means they hit home elsewhere, for someone else. This is poetry, after all, which I will forever believe is the most subjective of all literary genres.) For me, many of these poems felt like they'd work best being read aloud by Rudy himself, but a lot of them also felt altogether unfinished and/or distractingly personal. Poetry is personal, yes, and has every right to be (whatever it wants/needs to be), but I think the best/my favorite poets are the ones who transform the personal into the universal. Ultimately, this collection didn't seem as cohesive as all my favorite poetry collections feel, and I thought the poems about past romantic relationships overall were a detriment to the collection. The poems that shined brightest for me were the grittiest poems, the ones that told the truth about what it is to be black in America. Some of my favorite lines, then: ""it must be nice to feel so safe,you have to invent new ways toput yourself in danger.""""Being black in America is knowing there's a thin linebetween a traffic stop and the cemetery.""—both from ""Adrenaline Rush""""I think about how this magic trickhas become too familiar. Libertyjust vanishing without any explanation.""—from ""Liberty"" [Three stars for the parts of this collection that cried/screamed/whispered/really sang to me.]"
162,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58203378-stefanie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I first discovered Rudy Francisco as a spoken word poet. And with him I discovered spoken word poetry, I'm pretty sure. So when I found out he had a book, I had to have it. Helium is the first and only poetry collection I own, so I have nothing to compare it to. But the fact that Rudy convinced me to buy it after hearing only a couple of poems performed by him, says a lot about his work, talent, and how I received his poems.Some of my favorite poems are, no surprise, also ones he performed. For example: My Honest Poem, Chameleon, To the Man Standing on the Corner Holding the Sign That Said ""God Hates Gays"", and Rifle II. I liked all of his poems, but some new favorites I discovered are: Mess, Haunted, Skin II, Adrenaline Rush, and Roulette.With over 50 poems it's hard to name one specific theme, and I don't think that's what Rudy was going for either. The collection mostly touches upon themes like identity, love, race and racism, family, gender, religion, mental health, mistakes, forgiveness and acceptance. Reading this sum of themes and reading Helium from beginning to end gave me a sense that the collection altogether is about life, and that by reading all four parts chronologically you go through life. Not necessarily a textbook life, but one with lots of ups and downs. Or maybe it's more of a life lesson. That is not to say there is a distinctive order in the poems, but I did notice the last part was more about forgiveness and acceptance, whereas the other parts had more of a struggling air to them (not all of them of course, that would be a wrongful generalization).Rudy Francisco is one of my favorite poets, both spoken and on paper. His poems are powerful and real, relevant in today's society, and still manage to install hope. "
163,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27711414-laura,No Rating,"4.75 starsI read this while listening to the audiobook and this definitely enhanced the experience for me. My favourites were his long poems, they touch on such great topics with incredible depth and freshness, and I got inspired more than once by certain lines to write my own poems.Many of his short poems have such good imagery and concepts that it's honestly a sin he didn't expand on them. That length makes me think of an evolved version of the insta-poem, because they are super short, but however, they have a lot inside of them (they show the author is more mature than many of the famous insta-poets, and they don't fall so easily in the trap of quick ""I can relate"" ammunition). Some of his endings are a bit meh in my opinion, it's like he creates the punchline throughout the poem and then adds something more bland at the end. Also, the way he reads some endings... too dramatic in my opinion for what it is. I think he could've improved greatly with a bit of editorial help.What I personally found the most original and brave in the collection is when the author writes about his own personal mistakes and shortcomings. It really shows that he has grown as a person, and it shows humility and modesty to recognise and accept that you weren't always this great and woke. It is inspiring, and I think it has the potential to push others to examine themselves and be honest with each other, so that we can create a more compassionate and tolerant society."

The poems are beautiful, heartfelt, authentic, powerful, and so much more. Do you ever just feel like words understand you (not the other way around). Idk I just felt the poems and words resonated with me and I really needed that? I was in an odd mood.

166,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43992007-alisa,Rating 3 out of 5,"I loved this and wanted to give it five starts until the last two sections. Rudy Francisco probably doesn't write about mental health much, but regardless, in his poem ""To The Man Standing..."" he threw out the names of multiple mental illnesses in a really harmful way. For example, when he wrote:""I bet he yells like a schizophrenic nail gun, damaging all things that care about himenough to get close.""What am I supposed to think after reading that??? If it's any consolation, it's not just him. Any book that does this automatically makes me rate it less, and there's a lot of books that do this. And then the last two poems, the big finale of the book, just didn't sit well with me. All too often people say, ""it could be worse. Just be happy,"" and that's just not helpful. It felt like that's what the poems' messages were though. Maybe this is just a matter of personal preference. Besides everything I mentioned though, I did enjoy this style of poetry and the heavy metaphors. I thought those were masterpieces."

The most moving set of poems I've read in a while. Francisco has an extraordinary ability to play with words, his imagery is so well crafted I don't think it compares to any other writer in our time. That's what makes this book brilliant, worth reading a dozen times over, the words in his poems come alive and play a special tune that's bound to make the feet of your heart move, dance, come alive with a rush of emotions you didn't even know you needed to feel until you read the poem."

I'm not saying that poetry from Shakespearian times or even the 1900's aren't beautifully scripted pieces of art, but I guess I'm saying I felt a constant disconnect from poetry for a while because my vernacular and huge parts of my everyday life like technology or social media were never involved in them. Then, I branched out to the world of modern poetry. That's where this book comes in! It has a mix of short and long poems that touch on many different topics, themes, and emotions. I haven't finished it yet but from what I've read I really enjoy it so far. I def recommend it! I also have a few other modern poetry books in my book library if anyone wants to check them out :)"

I thought his poems were very honest and many of them super eye-opening! Beautiful. Here were a few of my favourite lines: ""You gorgeous earthquake. You cracked hourglass with sand spilling from behind your ribs. You wasted my time.""""I still remember you like a dream tattooed to the inner walls of a long-term memory, but some days I wonder if you existed at all.""

Talk about a visceral experience. Rudy paints pain in a way that makes me feel like I’ve lived through it myself, in that moment, regardless of my own experience. His words coloring my perspective in ways I didn’t know possible. Rudy has the capacity to bring about that feeling– you know the feeling — like a cold sweat all through your body, but not sweat. Emotion. Feeling. Most closely feels like goosebumps, and yet, that doesn’t quite encapsulate the depth of the experience.

I cried. I savored this. Rudy Francisco has been my favorite poet for years, he has a way with words that pierces through your heart and clings to your soul. The words take over your brain and force you to feel, to ache. Simply, his words demand to be heard. This book covered a variety of topics, each powerful and beautifully written. I loved the way he wrote about love, the way its ugly and destructive but also beautiful and all consuming. How he explored race and masculinity. Police brutality. Violence. His poetry is raw and real, and so unbelievably good. "

Often your day is a museum of disappointments, Hanging from events that were outside of your control, When you feel like your guardianAngel put in his two weeks notified two months ago and just decided not to tell you…”Very much like Rupi Kaur, his poetry is short, easy to read, and makes you feel something so strong in such a small amount of words. I enjoyed part III and IV the most. He brings up important topics, like race and the environment, and allows the reader into a part of his soul/thoughts. Very happy I gave this a shot, as I’m not too much of a poetry fan. This is easily accessible to everyone, so high recommend. "
174,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1225362-matt,Rating 3 out of 5,"Spoken word poetry doesn't leap off the page unless you already know the cadence, can hear it; I've heard Francisco's work, so I hear the rhythm, mostly, when I read his lines. Still, though, something is clearly lost; white space does not silence or pauses quite make.[3 stars for uneven quality, 1 star greater for the gems in this collection and 1 star less for how tired his relationship tropes* fall.]* If I never read another thing about a beautiful barista, I will have still read that tired and lame ass poem too many times. That she in Francisco's version works at a Starsucks only makes his self-serving view of women in this collection worse."
175,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this, as I did not like any sort of poetry in English class and have avoided it since. This has definitely changed my mind. This collection has a variety of poems covering racism, discrimination, anxiety, love, depression, and more.Some of the poems did seem to be accusatory in nature and were a bit difficult for me to get through. The is a mix of short and long poems, but some of the long poems felt as though they dragged on a bit. The work is also separated into four sections and it was not clear why this was done. That being said, there are some excellent metaphors in this collection and I did find myself resonating with a lot of the work."

Yet he is young and his voice is too. Some poems in Helium are wonderful. They spark and resonate. Others fall into predictability, are pretentious, detached. Francisco’s voice is a great addition to the poetry genre. In time, as he matures and he releases more and more collections, he will quite possibly be a classic voice of this decade. Helium is a wonderful collection. It just needs a better editing eye than perhaps Button can offer. "

I immediately went looking for it and suggested it to my library. It only took 6 years but they finally bought it and reminded me that I wanted to read it. I’m not a huge poetry fan because a lot of it I just don’t get. But Rudy’s poems feel accessible for someone like me. I can enjoy the artistry of them but also understand the point.

It's interesting to see how a spoken word performer places their words on the paper, the nuance carried through via enjambments and stanza breaks. Some of these poems felt tight and precise in their construction. Others I felt were too liberal in their use of casual phrases that may lend themselves to performance but could have been trimmed for the page.
