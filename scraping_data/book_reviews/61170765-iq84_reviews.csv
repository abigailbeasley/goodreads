0,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"1Q84 is undoubtedly the biggest literary let-down I have ever come across. The synopsis and plot outline sound fascinating, the reviews have been glowing - am I (trying to) read a different 1Q84 than everyone else? Apparently not, judging by the far-too-few reviews that sum up my feelings towards this nothing of a book. One of my favourite lines from one of my favourite of these few reviews is as follows, from theatlantic.com: ""It's hard to believe that some of the critics praising 1Q84 didn't really feel, at times, like throwing the book in the air and walking away. Trying to say anything definite about it is like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall. (Even the title's allusion to Orwell seems vague. It's an elaborate puzzle... which, when assembled, adds up to a picture of a perfect blank. For me, reading it was the literary equivalent of biting into a large, pumped-up soufflé. After finishing five pounds of book, I was still hungry — for a novel.""  The only difference between this critic's view of the book and mine is that I remain unable to finish the damn thing. Putting the nothingness of the book aside, there are plenty of other, more frustrating issues to contend with.These are a few of the problems I personally had with 1Q84:Aomame comes across as a flat, two-dimensional character whose main purpose is to serve as (an older male) fantasy. Within a few pages of meeting her, she experiences flashbacks of a detailed lesbian encounter she experienced with a friend, though she is not, in fact lesbian, bi-sexual, in the slightest bit attracted to woman. This would not be an issue if it appeared to serve any purpose towards her character development - but it doesn't. Instead, it begins to follow the pornographic trend of girl-on-girl sex for the sole purpose of pleasing men. Literally, Aomame and the other woman have sex for NO other reason then to attract the men they have picked up. (To clarify again - Aomame doesn't particularly want to have sex with the other woman at all.) This (sterotypically) male ""fantasy"" further continues as the reader is told countless times how she is attracted only to much older men with receding hairlines, and proceeds to detail each of these sexual encounters. There is nothing wrong with any of the aforementioned as it stands, to each their own, and it would not be a problem if it served a purpose to the story but as far as I'm aware so far it really doesn't. The story would in no way be impacted if any of these scenes were to be removed. Aomame is in no way empowered by the depiction of her sex life, instead she is an object - a pornagraphic object, again apparently designed for the titillation of the reader.If it's in the best interest of the book in question, I am perfectly ok with reading about bigoted characters, or even books written by writers with an obvious agenda that clashes with my own beliefs, if the book is good, and provokes thought. 1Q84 is not one of these books. The blatant misogyny does not serve a purpose and therefore I must assume that it was not considered to be an issue at all for the purposes of the book. I honestly felt that all the female characters in this were written as fantasy - not just Aomame, but Every. Single. Woman. There is the ""older married girlfriend"" who serves no purpose other than to be a sexual object for Tengo (she doesn't even have a name); there is the police woman who befriends Aomame and constantly wants sex with her though she is self-declared ""completely straight"" (and appears to serve no other purpose in the book - she isn't grappling with her sexuality, this isn't an exploration of multifaceted queerness or a critique of the heteronormative structures that this character exists within, she simply is there to have girl-on-girl sex without the complications of actual character development); and even with Fuka-Eri more attention was spent on the shape of her breasts than on her merits as a person or writer. It's also been brought to my attention that there are many other instances of blatant misogyny that I have missed in the review: this is clearly not an exhaustive list (and I only got two thirds of the way through the book. Feel free to share thoughts below, that's what the comment section is for).Other books allow viewpoints such as this to be limited to the perspective of a character. The narrator in Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World muses on his attraction to an slightly overweight woman, and his surprise that she is attractive. A little unpleasant, yes, but it fits in with how his character progresses. He is largely respectful towards the girl in question and to the other women in the book, and is overall a rather sympathetic character. Hajime in South of the Border, West of the Sun is rather more unlikeable in this respect, with the way he treats the women in his life, but again this is part of the journey of his character. 1Q84 goes so far beyond that, the sexism that permeates this entire story is not limited to character and is irredeemable.Tengo is likeable to a point, but all his segments of the story are the most repetitive in the book, which is a constant source of frustration. Also - and likely because of this - he doesn't really do much. He has a lot of sex with his older, married girlfriend (and we know that she is older and married because that statement appears to have taken the place of her name, appearing at least 5 times in every chapter about Tengo). I will also admit that I grew very, very weary of every conversation she had with Tengo being punctuated by lines such as ""she said to him, massaging his scrotum in her hand.""  As with Aomame's segments, the sex all truly appears to serve no purpose, and is crudely written at that, meaning it all comes across as both needlessly pornographic, and incredibly boring, two things good writing - and good sex - should never be. When Tengo is not having dull sexual encounters with his older married girlfriend, he mostly wanders around not doing anything. This is described in detail, which I will admit is a fairly impressive feat considering he really isn't doing anything.Moments of this novel appear to hold onto a central plot, but it is so bogged down with mundane details  along the lines of ""Tengo got up, showered and dressed. Then he cooked his breakfast. He sat down to eat his breakfast, after which he wandered around the room for a while. After this, he made a phone call, wrote some of his book, made some rice and salad, and waited for his older married girlfriend to call. She didn't call, so he went for a walk outside. His walk outside was long and went nowhere. While he was resting after his walk outside, Tengo read a book about the indigenous people of some country whose relevance is not made clear out loud and in minute and soporous detail so that the reader of THIS book can also experience the pedantic boredom of the book he was reading. After he had finished reading the book out loud and in minute detail, Tengo made dinner and went to bed. After he went to bed he couldn't sleep, so he got up and wrote some more of his book, though he found writing at night to be difficult and not as good as writing in the day, even though in the day his older married girlfriend was sometimes a distraction to him and got jealous at anything that took attention away from her even though she was older and married and nameless and the married aspect of her life should probably have been enough of a distraction in itself for her to not be sleeping with someone else. But that was fine with Tengo because he liked sex with his older married girlfriend very much. He didn't even mind that sex with his older married girlfriend was a sometimes a distraction from his writing work. As he wrote his book he thought about..."" etc etc that it is near impossible to discern what is actually worth reading, rather than skimming over. I'm pretty sure that if all the moments of needless, boring repetition were removed, the novel would come well under the 500 page mark - but then the appalling details and lack of plot would have nothing to hide behind at all!The characters reactions to everything were utterly implausible to me. Tengo and his editor are totally panicked about the idea of anyone finding out they re-wrote Air Chrysalis (the idea of co-writing or ""editing"" is completely out of the question) but Aomame isn't even bothered by the fact that she is in a world that is not her own. She has essentially fallen into a parallel universe and her reaction to that is... actually, I'm not even sure if she reacted at all to this knowledge. She also freaks out when she holds a gun, but has no apparent qualms about killing a man with a needle. There are many, many other reactions that bothered me but I can't think of them clearly enough to write about them - I think my mind has an innate defence against boredom that means I forget anything that has bored me to this degree. The very worst part about this vapid 1000+ page novel, however, is that people who have finished the book tell me that nothing else happens!!!!! I can't handle it, I really can't. Perhaps if I'd come into this with lower expectations, I may have been less disappointed. It would have still been a terrible book, but I would feel less betrayed by this fact. 14/4/16: Final note: I have since read at least ten other books by Murakami (and counting), so I am 100% certain that my dislike of 1Q84 has nothing to do with his ""style"" of writing. Many (most) of his other stories don't exactly have... plots, or things that ""happen"" - a ""point"", or concrete endings of any kind but they work. Some more than others, of course, but while I have adored many (Sputnik Sweetheart, Norwegian Wood, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage stand out at the top of the list) and found others somewhat less enjoyable (South of the Border, West of the Sun), none of his other works I have read are on the level of 1Q84 at all. I have also read many other books by other authors where ""nothing"" happens, and yet the work is utterly captivating. I still stand by this review completely.And yes, of course you are entitled to disagree entirely, but please do refrain from a) pointless insults that trivialise mental illnesses; b) grammatically incorrect complaints of my use of British English (as opposed to American English) spellings; c) personal attacks in general (these manage to be both rude and boring and hardly facilitate an interesting discussion)"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've decided that 2017 will be the year I take on my TBR ""long list"". I always find myself torn between the ever-growing pile of ARCs and recent releases I want to read, and those books I've been meaning to read forever but keep putting off. So I've decided to read a book from my ""long list"" alongside the ARCs/new releases I'm currently reading. 1Q84 got to be the first. Midnight's Children will be the second. And then - deep breath - on to Infinite Jest and maybe the rest of - gasp - In Search of Lost Time. As for 1Q84, for a 1100+ page book, it was extremely readable. Very easy to dip in and out of in a way that I suspect some of the others on my list won't be. The translation is perfectly smooth. I enjoyed the story and the characters, especially Aomame, who is a total badass and spends her spare time disposing of men who are violent towards women.It's really hard to explain what it's about. Several people have spotted me reading this beast and have expressed curiosity over the story and I'm like ""Um, so it's kind of a magical realism dystopia set in 1984 with parallel universes, religious cults, and a love story"". Well, I guess that about sums it up.The story moves between the perspectives of Aomame who ""offs"" abusive men, and Tengo who is an aspiring novelist. Though their stories are separate for the most part, it becomes apparent as the tale unfolds that Aomame and Tengo's pasts - and futures - are entwined. Aomame's ""job"" leads her toward the religious cult, Sakigake, and Tengo agrees to participate in a rewrite of a novel - Air Chrysalis - by Fuka-Eri, a young woman who escaped said religious cult. The rewriting of the book sparks many strange events, as the plot gives up some of Sakigake's darkest secrets. As parts of Air Chrysalis start to bleed into reality, we see that this might not be the world it always was; that at some point, something changed, and 1984 became 1Q84.I'm not going to lie to you - I have never read a 1100+ page book that didn't waffle on in parts, and this one is no exception. There are times when Murakami's attention to detail, especially attention to the small behaviours of characters living alone, becomes too much, and repetitive. I grew tired of hearing about Aomame's dissatisfaction with her breasts (sex, sexual desire and the human body are some of the major themes in Murakami's work). And yet, I looked forward to picking it up again. The story interested me. The characters interested me. I needed to know what would happen.One thing I can say for certain is that I've never read anything quite like it. 1Q84 is a bizarre blend of fantasy, religion, sex, and loneliness, and everything is connected in subtle ways. There's a whole lot of synchronicity, which in itself feels like an act of synchronicity, given the mentions of Carl Jung, who himself first explained the concept. But, most of all - and surprisingly - the story is romantic and hopeful. For a book that gets up to its neck in the bizarre and otherworldly, it was pleasing yet strange to see it all come back to a love story. Even a cold unromantic like me was convinced.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1576317-kristin-myrtle,Rating 4 out of 5,"I just finished 1Q84 and already I've begun to notice strange peculiarities in the world around me. As I closed the book and stood up, I looked around my shabby apartment. Same walls, same badly painted walls, same James Dean poster, but something seemed off. Something infinitesimal. The walls seemed closer or were they further away? And James, wasn't there a cigarette clasped between your lips before? Now you're just staring off into space with that amazing, casual air of indifference. I shut my eyes and shake my head. It's just the residual effect of Murakami's prose, I tell myself. Nothing more. I went about the rest of my day as usual but late that night I fell into a restless sleep. I had the strangest dream...I dreamt of him. You know... the one. The one I love. The one separated from me because of timing and distance and all the other inane trivialities that prevent us from taking the next logical step. In my dream he was reading 1Q84 as well. Well actually he was just finishing it, closing it with a self-satisfied thwack, for it is quite a tome. Then he just sat there, comtemplatively, his fingers steepled together in a pyramid under his chin. And suddenly I appeared there with him in my dream. I, like, just walked in from off-stage and sat down on the floor in front of him cross-legged. Is it weird to appear in your own dream? I don't know if that's ever happened to me before. Anyways, we just talked all night about 1Q84, about Tengo and Aomame, the star-crossed, NO moon-crossed lovers. We talked about the people they knew and loved. Ayumi, Komatsu and Tengo's dad. Tengo's married older lover. The dowager that befriends and mentors Aomame and her stoic level-headed gay bodyguard Tamaru. We discussed Fuka-Eri and the strange cult, Sakigake, she escaped, and the stranger story she wrote that Tengo had been hired to ghostwrite: Air Chrysalis. How this story acts as a catalyst for the whole novel, it gets is moving. Ushikawa, Leader, Buzzcut and Ponytail, Tsubasa, Professor Ebisuno, and the three nurses that Tengo meets. How he compares them to the witches from Macbeth. And so many literary references, it's like Murakami is name dropping! Dickens, Proust and Chekov- to name a few. And The Little People. How could we forget The Little People?! How they just appear strangely and build the elusive Air Chrysalis. The huge, womb-like, peanut-shaped, furry, glowing, egg thingy that materializes by their hands seemingly out of thin air. What does the Air Chrysalis represent? And how does it tie in with Sakigake and Fuka-Eri? And, utimately, what's inside it?But more than anything, as I looked up into the eyes of the man I adored, we spoke of love. How this is above all A Love Story, and an unbelievably hopeful one at that. Because in 1Q84 true love exists and it matters, it makes a difference! It obliterates obstacles, it takes on a life of it's own. And the connections that we make, that we forge, they last. They live and breathe. They are not ephemeral... they are not gossamer.And then I just woke up, the dream dissolved as abruptly as it began. Anyways after that I didn't really notice any changes in the world around me. James Dean looks normal to me now. But maybe I've just become accustomed to it all. I don't know what Murakami is tapped into, I don't know where his talent, his inspiration comes from, but it never fails to move me. There's an ease and an elegance to his prose. And it is absolutely, magnificently beyond beautiful. He defies classification... I could go on and on. He's a world class writer and this is a world class book."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5613369-des,Rating 1 out of 5,"I guess I can now write this review since I've settled down from doing a victory lap around my house as a result of completing this steaming pile of hot garbage. Maybe before I totally slam the book, I should say what I did like but to be honest there was very little to like. The plot wasn't bad. The love story & connection between Tengo & Aomame was somewhat cute. I could roll with all this. What blows my mind is that Murakami felt he needed 900+ pages to drag this whole shebang out. The prose was so mundane and the narrative dragged on and on and on that it was difficult to accurately gauge the turning points and climax of the story. Oh, and let's not talk about the constant repetition and writing about wasting time while wasting my time because I'm reading about him writing about wasting time. Are you still with me? I enjoy mind-twisting and mind-bending elements in a novel but I need some sort of anchor to base these things on. Murakami introduces Sakigake, dohta, maza and the Little People yet he only explores the periphery of these concepts (especially the Little People! Murakami, please tell me who they are and what the deal is with them. Like seriously, I really want to know). So then the question is what did he use the 900+ pages for? Honestly, your guess is as good as mine because after this slugfest I remain completely and utterly bewildered. Things also happen in this novel just because. There is no explanation and very vague character development. Upon completion, I just felt I was left with nothing. Nothing.I've heard positive things about some of his other works but after this experience I cannot say when next I will be picking up another Murakami to read. It shall surely be awhile yet, if ever. ETA (on 24 January 2014 1:35AM Central European Time (CET)1. By some miracle this review has garnered a boatload of likes. Thank you good people. 2. However, I must say I am tired of random people flocking over to the comment section to (loudly) voice their disagreement, question my reading choices, question why I finished the book and just generally be condescending. This is my review space. I read the book, didn't like it and expressed it all in a review. If you disagree and you loved it, that's absolutely fine. Use your own review space to worship it. Don't come to mine and be a nuisance. 3. Goodreads, please introduce the option to lock the comment section of specific reviews for the love of God. ETA (on 10 February 2014 12:30AM Central European Time (CET)1. On January 31 2014 Goodreads honored my request and locked this review.2. I am grateful that Goodreads honored my request and even though I am aware of the setting that blocks non-friends from commenting on my reviews that still seems to me to be an extreme option. I'm not averse to non-friends commenting on my reviews. I would just like the option to lock certain reviews to prevent them from descending into an unnecessary bitch fest from non-friends like this one did prior to the lock. "
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/428808-zach,Rating 1 out of 5,"Aomame, a small-breasted woman, is an assassin who targets men who mistreat women. Tengo, a large man, teaches math, and is a writer. Tengo, the large man, and Aomame, the small-breasted woman, once held hands as children, and although they have not seen each other in the twenty years since, they are still soul mates. Tengo, the math teacher, becomes embroiled in a conspiracy to re-write the novella “Air Chrysalis,” by Fuka-Eri, a large-breasted teenager, which is a good story written poorly. Tengo, when he is not teaching math or writing, misses Aomame, the small-breasted woman with whom he once held hands. Aomame, when she is not killing misogynists or lamenting the size of her breasts, misses Tengo, the large man with whom she once held hands. Aomame has mysteriously been transported from her own world of 1984 to the mysterious new world of 1Q84, which has two moons and is controlled to some degree by the Little People, who say “ho ho.” Aomame sees there are two moons. Tengo sees there are two moons. There are two moons. One is normal, the other is small and green. The normal moon is the moon from 1984, but the other moon, which is small and green, can be seen only in 1Q84, the mysterious other world which is controlled to some degree by the Little People. Tengo has a recurring memory from when he was an infant of seeing a man who was not his father suckle at Tengo’s mother’s breasts. Women have breasts. Some breasts are large (Fuka-Eri’s), while others are small (Aomame’s). Aomame laments this fact. Aomame yearns for larger breasts. She also yearns for Tengo, the writer whose hand she held twenty years before, when they were ten. They have not seen each other since, but they still love one another. Aomame does not allow this to distract her from her mission, which is assassinating men who have grievously mistreated women. Aomame was raised in the cult of the Society of Witnesses. Tengo was raised by his father after his mother died when he was young. His father collected NHK fees. This was not the man Tengo recalls seeing suckle at his mother’s breasts. Tengo was often forced to accompany his father on his work trips, collecting NHK fees. Aomame was often forced to accompany her parents spreading the evangel. The Little People say “ho ho.” There are two moons. Tengo is a large man. Women also have pubic hair, unless they don’t, in which case they are probably ghosts, or shadows, in which case no man can be held accountable for sexually assaulting them, no matter their age. The Little People are assumed to be evil, although mostly the Little People just say “ho ho.” Women who are victims get what’s coming to them. George Orwell wrote a book called 1984. The year is 1984. Aomame yearns for Tengo. Tengo yearns for Aomame. Ushikawa, an ugly man, is unpleasant to look at. "

7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25375513-rick-riordan,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'd heard it was a difficult read, and certainly it is long, at well over 900 pages, but I find that I'm flying through it. Murakami knows how to keep the pages turning with a brilliant mix of mystery, fantasy and intrigue. Two characters, Aomame and Tengu, find themselves slipping into an alternate version of the world in 1984 -- a world Aomame names 1Q84. What is causing this shift, and whom can they trust? Those are just some of the questions facing them. The book reminds me of Orwell, of course, but also Gabriel Marquez and some early dark urban fantasy like The Land of Laughs by Jonathan Carroll or Little, Big by John Crowley. (Which you should read, if you haven't.) Yet Murakami isn't really like anyone else, exactly. He has that fresh 'something,' just like the fictional editor Komatsu in his narrative is looking for. Check out the book!"

Even if you can't get together with that person.”Another wonderful immersion into Haruki Murakami's 1Q84 (second reading)! Besides Aomame's 1Q84 alternate reality, I also focused on Tengo's Cat Town. Are these realities mutually exclusive from 1984? The ending suggests we all have a choice about what reality we create and inhabit. Thoroughly enjoyed this second read! _____You never know where you'll find yourself when you pick up one of Haruki Murakami's novels. I've come to believe that's exactly the way it should be. 1Q84 is no exception. The way Murakami weaves history with a constantly evolving reality gives the feel of a speculative novel offering an alternative history. But, besides seeing 2 moons, where is the difference in what the protagonist, Aomame, has dubbed 1Q84 and 'the real' 1984? When Aomame gets out of her taxi and makes an unexpected/out of the ordinary decision, does she really open an alternative 1984 or has Aomame simply opened herself up to experiencing a deeper reality? The cab driver had both warned her that ""Things are not what they seem"" and ""There is always only one reality."" The interweaving stories of a math teacher, Tengo, and the 17-year old Fuka-Eri (whose novel Tengo rewrites) add surprises and bizarre twists to this nearly 1,000-page epic. This is a fantastic read about finding yourself and finding love! I highly recommend 1Q84!"

The letter Q and the Japanese number 9 (typically romanized as ""kyū"", but as ""kew"" on the book's Japanese cover) are homophones, which are often used in Japanese wordplay.The events of 1Q84 take place in Tokyo during a fictionalized year of 1984, with the first volume set between April and June, the second between July and September, and the third between October and December.The book opens with a female character named Aomame as she rides a taxi in Tokyo on her way to a work assignment. When the taxi gets stuck in a traffic jam on the Shibuya Route of the Shuto Expressway, the driver suggests that she get out of the car and climb down an emergency escape in order to make it to her important meeting, though he warns her that doing so might change the very nature of reality. After some hesitation, Aomame eventually makes her way to a hotel in Shibuya and poses as a hotel attendant in order to kill a hotel guest. She performs the murder with an ice pick that leaves almost no trace on its victim, leading investigators to conclude that he died a natural death from heart failure.Aomame starts to have bizarre experiences, noticing new details about the world that are subtly different. For instance, she notices Tokyo police officers carrying automatic handguns, when they had previously carried revolvers. Aomame checks her memories against the archives of major newspapers and finds that there were several recent major news stories of which she has no recollection. One of these stories concerned a group of extremists who were engaged in a stand-off with police in the mountains of Yamanashi Prefecture. Upon reading these articles, she concludes that she must be living in an alternative reality, which she calls ""1Q84"", and suspects that she entered it about the time she heard the Janáček Sinfonietta on the taxi radio. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «یک کیو هشتادوچهار»؛ «وان کیو ایتی فور»؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: اول اکتبر سال 2016میلادیعنوان 1: 1کیو84؛ نویسنده: هاروکی موراکامی؛ مترجم: مرتضی بغدادی؛ تهران، چشمه، 1389؛ در 498ص؛ شابک 9789643628598؛ عنوان گسترده وان کیو ایتی فور؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ژاپن - سده 21معنوان 2: ؛ نویسنده: هاروکی موراکامی؛ مترجم: معصومه عباسی نتاج عمرانی؛ تهران، آوای مکتوب، 1394؛ در سه جلد؛ شابک دوره9786007364123؛ برگردان از متن انگلیسی به فارسی؛ عنوان 3: ؛ نویسنده: هاروکی موراکامی؛ مترجم: مرتضی بغدادی؛ تهران، شرکت تعاونی کارآفرینان فرهنگ و هنر، 1393؛ در دو جلد؛ شابک 9786001780882؛ عنوان گسترده: وان کیو ایتی فور؛داستان «1 کیو 84»، (ایچی-کیو-هاچی-یون) رمانی از «هاروکی موراکامی» نویسنده ژاپنی ست، که بین سال‌های 2009میلادی تا سال 2010میلادی، در سه جلد منتشر شده‌ است؛ عنوان داستان، از روی تصادف، یادآور رمان «1984» نوشته ی «جورج اورول» نیست؛ بلکه حرف انگلیسی «کیو»، در ژاپن، همانند عدد «9» خوانده می‌شود؛ اجزای سازنده ی این رمان نیز تازه نیستند؛ اما آن‌ها مفصل و دقیق هستند.؛ توصیفات به ظاهر بی اهمیت، از «موسیقی»، «ادبیات» و «آماده سازی غذا»، رشته‌ های روایی خیالی را، آنقدر خوب به هم وصل می‌کند، که نگویید و نپرسید؛ «موراکامی» به گونه‌ ای به توصیف دنیاهای موازی، زنان قاتل، و ارواح، می‌پردازند؛ که انگار همه ی آن‌ها واقعی هستند؛چکیده داستان: سال 1984میلادی در کشور «ژاپن»، «آئو مامه» در میان ترافیک شهر «توکیو»، از تاکسی پیاده می‌شود؛ چرا که نمی‌خواهد یک قرار دیدار بسیار حساس را از دست بدهد؛ او برای آنکه به اتوبان برسد، از پله‌ های اتوبان سود می‌برد، و بدون آنکه متوجه شود، وارد یک دنیای موازی با دنیای واقعی می‌شود؛ تنها در نگاه دوم است، که متوجه تغییرات کوچکی، همانند اونیفورم متفاوت پلیس‌ها، می‌گردد؛ او با یک فرقه برخورد می‌کند، که در مورد آنها چیزی نشنیده‌ است؛ اما درست به موقع به قرار ملاقات خویش نیز می‌رسد، و در یک هتل، مردی را با یک سوزن بسیار کوچک، به قتل می‌رساند؛ ناگهان دو ماه از آسمان آویخته می‌شوند.؛ ...؛ موراکامی، در دیگر سوی داستان، به یک نویسنده ی غیرحرفه‌ ای، به نام «تنگو» پرداخته‌ است؛ «تنگو» زمانی که سفارش ویرایش نخستین رمان نوجوان هفده ساله‌ ای به نام «فوکائری»، با عنوان: «عروسکی از هوا» را می‌پذیرد، چیزهای عجیب و غیرعادی را پشت سر می‌گذارد؛ در این کتاب نه تنها ماهیت روح مانند «لیتل پیپل»، بلکه یک فرقه مذهبی، با آیین‌های هولناک نیز آشکار می‌گردد؛ «موراکامی» هوشمندانه در فصل‌های کتابش به تناوب رشته ی ماجراها را، برای ساختن داستان به هم می‌بافد؛ به زودی روشن می‌شود که قهرمانان او، به عنوان دانشجو شناخته شده‌ اند، و در برهه ی زمانی فراموش نشده‌ اند؛ «آئو مامه» و «تنگو»، نه تنها به این دلیل قهرمانان معمولی «موراکامی» هستند، بلکه باهوش، با استعداد، و جذاب نیز هستند؛ این خصلت‌ها برای «موراکامی»، شرط‌های مهم و لازم قهرمانانش هستند؛ البته «موراکامی» تنها به روایت یک داستان عاشقانه نمی‌پردازند؛ او بارها مشکلات بزرگی، همچون پیروی از اصول جمعیت‌های مذهبی، و سوء استفاده از کودکان زیر سن قانونی را، مطرح کرده‌؛ «موراکامی» بطور مرتب نقل قول‌ها، و اشارات تلویحی را، مورد استفاده قرار داده‌، در پایان کتاب، «آئومامه» همانند آغاز کتاب، در یک اتوبان شلوغ قرار دارد؛ تا این‌جای کتاب برداشت‌ها اندک هستند، و به جای پاسخ، پرسشها همچنان بی پاسخ باقی می‌مانند؛ «تنگو» در صفحه ی پایانی این کتاب می‌گوید: «من آئومامه را خواهم یافت».؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 04/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 31/05/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1727205-megha,Rating 3 out of 5,"If you aren't already enamored with Murakami's writing, I recommend not reading 1Q84 - unless what you want is a treasure hunt for some simple Japanese recipes. 1Q84 is actually a test to see how much Murakami fans are willing to put up with. And the test is a tough one. The first part of the book is nothing short of what you expect from Murakami. But towards the middle it really begins to sag with tedious, mundane descriptions. One reviewer called it memory-insultingly repetitive and that's not entirely wrong. (To be fair the repetitiveness is due to combining all the three books in a single volume in the English edition. But if they published it as one book, that's how people are going to read it.) Then there are numerous badly written sex scenes. So far, in his other books, I have been giving him a pass for those. But this time I couldn't help being annoyed. You know how when a new characters enters the scene, some authors would describe his/her countenance. Likewise, every time Murakami introduces a female character in 1Q84, he describes her breasts. What's up with that?!And yet I have slapped four stars up there. Clearly the man can do no wrong by me. I don't usually keep track of what books are going to be released soon. This is the only book I have ever pre-ordered. This is the only hardcover I own, because I did not want to wait till the paperback was out. I even carried this monster of a book on a flight because I did not want to put it on a hiatus while I was out of town.There is almost 1000 pages - that's plenty of room for the good and the bad. Tedious portions notwithstanding, what Murakami does best is still somewhere in there. And I am willing to forgive the rest. The world with the two moons is absolutely fascinating and full of intrigue. Despite the complicated plot and multiple threads, he writes with superb clarity and never leaves the reader lost and confused. The last part of the book has us following three intersecting story lines. Ushikawa, Aomame and Tengo are all looking at the same picture, but at different angles. Each one of them is trying to fill in the pieces outside their respective field of vision. And it all comes together very elegantly in the end.And that brings me to David Mitchell. Last year I had swooned all over Cloud Atlas. Since reading 1Q84, I find myself agreeing more and more with the reviews that call it pretentious, gimmicky and what not. Because compared to the way Murakami handles multiple stories, Mitchell does seem to be trying too hard. In any case, I did enjoy Cloud Atlas when I had read it and nothing is going to change that now. So no hard feelings, DM."
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27098959-leonard-gaya,Rating 5 out of 5,"Long-distance runners know that the best way to race to a personal best is to maintain an even pace from start to finish; they also understand that the longer the race, the slower the pace. Murakami has been a marathon runner his whole life, and 1Q84 was probably composed with this in mind. It is indeed a superb novel that spans across three volumes and is best appreciated unhurriedly.Going with the flow, I have enjoyed this novel immensely — yet, putting my impressions into words, I realise I’m having a hard time trying to pinpoint why. Despite the length and complexity of this novel (some 1,300 pages), the outline is quite minimal, the characters are few, the story is streamlined, relatively easy to follow. At heart, this is a love story, where a man and a woman, Aomame and Tengo, two long-lost childhood classmates, are meant to be together but keep missing each other. It is also much more than that. It is a novel about writing a novel and about reading a novel (namely Proust’s Recherche), a fiction about parallel universes and distorted realities, bridged through a recurring piece of music (Janáček’s Sinfonietta), a mystery about an oppressive religious cult, domestic abuse, crime and sexual violence. Also, a recipe book.The novel is set, for the most part, in the familiar reality of modern-day Tokyo and spans over the course of a few months. But there are also many off-kilter, uncanny, dreamlike or downright fantastical elements: two moons, a mysterious species of “Little People”, an “Air Chrysalis”, a Maza and a Dohta (mother and daughter?), an obese cult Leader, a misshapen hard-boiled private investigator called Ushikawa (appears in other novels). There is something in 1Q84 that made me think of these beautiful fantasy films by Hayao Miyazaki, especially My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away — two of my all-time favourite animated movies.In 1Q84, Murakami manages to blend all these unrelated threads seamlessly into a plot that, at the same time, follows an exact structure — switching POV back and forth, a device Murakami has used in other novels as well. And the whole thing flows naturally, in a suspenseful and engaging way. His prose too is detailed, meticulous, focused, to the point where ordinary things become uncanny, disturbing, comical, unreal. The dialogues and interior monologues are often quite long and slow-paced, but always gripping with an ever-present sense of emotional strain.Overall, Murakami uses everything he puts into his novel to the fullest. It’s like a long piece of minimal music (say like Philip Glass, Steve Reich or Michael Nyman): the processes of description and repetition are more important than the stuff they’re about. The result can be tedious, or it can be mesmerising and immersive. In the end, his novel is a kaleidoscopic view of this fascinating universe of 1Q84, a journey through suspense, violence, unease, love and desire, grief and loss, folly and comedy — the scenes with the annoying NHK door-to-door fee collector in vol. 3 are priceless.Ultimately, 1Q84 is the novel of a homecoming, like Odysseus sailing back to Ithaca after a long journey and many hardships. But in this case, we can’t be sure if we have landed on the shores of Ithaca, or the edge of 1th4c4..."

I believe mp owes me 20 dollars for finishing first. Well, since no monetary guidelines were stipulated, I will also accept 3 cats and 2 metaphors that don't make any sense. BeforeAs I eagerly await to tackle this tomeI am utterly afraid for the books that I ownEspecially the texts populating my deskMy patience for ""Brit-Lit"" will be put to the testBut my grades will be of little concernWhen these 900 pages will begin to burnA hole of delight to last for the agesAnd I won't care about homework while in his pagesBecause it isn't grades that last but literary heavenThen I'll always say, ""I remember Murakami and 1984 in 2011"" AfterAs you might be able to deduce from my little poem and the rating, I was a bit disappointed by this book. I think the main reason was the unwarranted length. I wouldn't mind reading a 900+ page novel if it meant that the book was going to really take me places. From what I've heard about Infinite Jest, Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell and others like it, they are quite the journey. Where you begin and where the book leads, makes for such a arc of character, theme and plot so as to incur upon the reader the impression a fully fleshed out world. I find that exciting. I like to experience whole life-times within one novel. It is the complete escape from this world, when you feel as though you've lived inside another for so long. I felt no such experience with 1Q84. Instead, was 922 pages of repetitious prose. When it boils down to it, there is not much exposition in here. All it is is the same arc of a character moving from the world they are used to, then into the ""Q"" world and finding everything weird. That happens to three different characters. And we have to be told the same-sounding impressions followed by similar realizations. I think that underneath it all, there is a lot to be said about this book. But I honestly do not feel as compelled to want to do so, since everything was repeated so often and so frequently.Occasionally, the book would break out of its redundancy and work the usual Murakami magic. But those moments were so far and few between, that any momentum gained would be slowed down by 50 pages of nothingness. Murakami loves to say every passing detail, significant or not, that goes through a character's head. He might write something like ""Aomame went into the kitchen. She walked up to the refrigerator. She looked at the refrigerator. Then she thought  I want to eat something because I know that I should. But I'm not hungry. I haven't been hungry in a long time, not since I parted with my one true love Tengo.  She opened the refrigerator and looked inside. She closed the door after deciding that nothing looked appetizing. She thought about her one true love, Tengo. And the fact that she hadn't seen him since she was a child."" I think he used a similar technique with other novels, Wind-Up Bird for example. I don't remember it bothering me at all. In fact reading this has made me want to go back and re-read Wind-Up to see how it compares. Because I hate to say it, but this book may have ruined my patience for that type of writing, which I thought worked so well in Wind-Up. Another similarity between the two was the simplicity of the writing. Both books feature straight-forward prose and a plethora of telling. I remember it working very well in Wind-Up, another claim I'd like to re-read for, but in 1Q84, it falls flat on its face. In the kind of the book that this is, it needs something to convince the reader of the unreal elements. I'm not sure what the formula for that is, of course there's no exact way of doing this, but there has to be better ways of writing a convincing magical-realist story than lines like this:""Aomame wondered if Fuka-Eri's dohta had been able to survive for long without her maza. The Little people had said that it was virtually impossible for a dohta to go on living without her maza. And what about a maza? What was it like for her to live after having lost the shadow of her heart and mind?""That could easily be straight out of a YA, fantasy novel.Then there were other lines that were just cheesy:""Ushikawa had a sharp sense of smell, and something smelled fishy""That last line may be due to translation, which I'm always willing to admit as a possibility. But I have faith in the translators, given that Jay Rubin has translated a majority of Murakami's works and the other novels were dissimilar in this regard to this book.There was also some of the ideas, not flaws of translation, that I didn't agree with. A thematic thread that runs throughout, is a zen-like balancing between opposing forces, usually represented in pairs. Murakami reiterates the idea that whenever an imbalance occurs, nature steps in to stabilize itself. This might be cute to find inside of a fortune cookie or on a license plate, but when taken to real life situations or the events of this book, it becomes an unsettling bit of moral relativism. This is especially apparent in a scene where Aomame kills a child rapist. I was somewhat intrigued by this idea at first. I tend to be a fan of stories about vigilante justice. But when Aomame arrives, the rapist explains how he was powerless against the forces that made him to do it. This is when it started to get weird. Because after Aomame kills the man, the next scene is of Tengo having sex with a girl under 18, without him able to control it. When reading that in context of lines like ""nature abhors a vacuum"", it's pretty weird. It's a dangerous notion to consider something as terrible as child rape in the context of yin-and-yang and everything in harmony. The other thing I disagreed with was the premise by which the entire book hangs. The two main characters are supposed to have held hands once, as ten year olds, and have been desperately in love for all the years that have followed. I didn't really buy that at all. There are many things that can pass off as unreal in a Murakami novel, but absolute, undying love because of a single encounter in elementary school is not one of them. Call me a cynic, but I don't believe that ever happens. This idea comes from a short story called ""On Meeting the 100% Perfect Girl"" that Murakami had written. Quite the opposite of 1Q84, it runs for only a couple pages. I think I can handle undying love at first sight when condensed down into a few pages. But when repeated over and over and over through 700 pages, it loses me completely.Of course, not everything is bad about this book, hence the 3 stars. As mentioned there are more than a few Murakami magic moments. He was still able to make me shudder, make me stare off into space for minutes at a time in quiet fascination. But I hope for his next book, his editor is given a little more power than he had here."
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1131783-eddie-watkins,Rating 3 out of 5,"Tengo did as he was told. He began pumping slowly.These two sentences, on the second to last page of this 924 page novel, are a neat summary of Murakami’s methods in 1Q84. Tengo has spent the novel longing for Aomame and they have just been reunited after twenty years. ‘Pumping’ refers to the action of Tengo’s penis in Aomame’s vagina. Underlying Murakami’s general approach to writing is an element of dictation, of simply transcribing the spontaneously generating narrative coursing through his head. This is what gives his novels their peculiar effortless dreaminess. He admits as much when he says that his first novel suddenly appeared to him while attending a baseball game. He simply went home and started writing it down. So - Tengo did as he was told. He began pumping slowly. - Tengo listens and obeys and gets down to business. This theme of dictation, of hearing alien narratives and putting them into action, of being a medium in its literal sense, is exhaustively explored and elaborated upon in 1Q84. In this way the novel is Murakami’s ultimate statement on his own art. He even goes so far as to make Tengo the author of the novel, or at least suggests as much. Through his experiences in the novel Tengo becomes the novelist he has been striving to become. In this way it is also generally inspirational for the aspiring creator in all of us.So the first sentence in this quote - Tengo did as he was told. - tackles the metaphysical (let’s say) aspects of Murakami’s art, the vaguely spiritual, the elements of ‘another world’, that inform this one. The second sentence - He began pumping slowly. - tackles the nitty gritty of his art, its praxis, while at the same time addressing its sexual nature, and there is plenty of sex and odd (even shameful) eroticism in 1Q84. But I don’t read “pumping slowly” first and foremost as the action of a penis in a vagina. I read it as what I will call Murakami’s ‘marathon aesthetic’. Everyone knows he runs marathons, right? Well, this opus is his marathon mind, that patient plodding single-mindedness and clarity, fully fleshed out. 1Q84 is a marathon transmuted into fiction. This would suggest that some might find it boring, and I will not argue that some might; as it is full of inconsequential detail and repetitions, just as I imagine the mind engaged in a marathon might be, and so requires a certain amount of patience from the reader. And though I am not a runner, let alone a marathoner, I have some understanding of the mind and body engaged in such a difficult and monotonous task (I have worked 9 – 5 in an office for 13 years haven’t I?), and I have an appreciation of dullness transcending itself and becoming fascinating. There is nothing like a stretch of dull repetitiveness to allow the mind to detach itself from its trammels and ‘catch some air’ and experience an unexpected ecstasy. Either that or get mired in routine and plod through a living death. There are strangely satisfying sensations and experiences beyond ‘the wall’, of second (and third and fourth and so on) winds, of ‘highs’, that long distance runners routinely mention, and 1Q84 is an exhibition in extreme detail of these.That takes care of those two sentences. Only 25,000 to go…But I’ll spare you my tiresome exegeses and briefly mention the literary references in the book. First, the title obviously references Orwell directly, but beyond that I didn’t see much meat to the reference. Other than providing a year and a setting before the internet took over our lives, which simplified the plotting immensely, and a few passing mentions of Big Brother in the guise of religious cults, Murakami didn’t go far with it.What was far more substantial were references to Proust – during a long stretch of the book one of the main characters is holed up in an apartment reading him – in that time itself, and its mutable wrap-around nature, is the medium in which the novel floats; so that even the longueurs are justified, in that they help the reader enter the ‘marathon mind.’ Even Proust himself showed the dullness of a dinner party by endlessly elaborating upon its tedium in words, thus giving the reader an even more tangible and personally direct experience of the event.I must also mention Murakami’s referencing of and reliance upon the thoughts of Jung, who is explicitly mentioned quite a few times. 1Q84 is very much a book of myths and how they inform our actions (even beyond our knowledge) and how their inherent power still sways us. The entire novel itself can be viewed as a descent into myth as a fractured being and ultimate reemergence into wholeness, and this is perhaps its most powerful theme, and Murakami’s light touch and his ability to dance with ideas and suppress (for the most part) heavy-handedness help make this the wisest and most profound Murakami book I have read."

It has everything that anyone would want in a book because it is composed of a little of every genre. The book has so many symbolisms and imageries that no one can figure it all out in the first read. The book is like all of Haruki Murakami's past books where it is about self discovery of the main character. This time it is about how two long lost lovers find each others to the point that they were meant for each other. The book is about Aomame, one of the main character in the book where in the beginning, she goes into this alternate 1984 called 1Q84. There she spends time with a old windower becomes fast friend. Soon she finds out the world is not what it seems as she takes down the leader of a cult. Then opposite character is with the male main character, Tengo who is a math teacher, who was a classmate of Aomame. He becomes the writer for 17 year old Fuka-Eri, who cannot write because she has dyslexic. He writes her story down and edits it becoming a national bestseller, called Air Chrysalis, which the plot of the story is the mystery at the center of the book as the two main characters meet, and falls in love. Overall, this is a great story that is highly recommendable to all who love to read, especially to those who loves to take on a challenge or not afraid to read a book that is over 1000 pages long. This is book is well over 5 stars. Haruki Murakmai is already a great writer, who has translated many great masterpieces into Japanese from English, but with 1Q84 he has created a masterpiece that rises him beyond anything ever could be imagined.

IG: There’s been some suggestion that the character Aomame is similar to Lisbeth Sanders.HM: That will always happen, because there aren’t many role models for women capable of violence.IG: Aomame has a particular knack, so to speak, for kicking men in the balls.HM: Realistically speaking, it’s impossible for women to protect themselves against men without resorting to a kick in the testicles. Most men are bigger and stronger than women. A swift testicle attack is a woman’s only chance.IG: So it’s a conscious tactic.HM: A strategy. Mao Zedong said it best. You find your opponent’s weak point and make the first move with a concentrated attack. It’s the only chance a guerilla force has of defeating a regular army.IG: So, the message is “go for the balls”.HM: Either that, or make sure you’ve got a gun.IG: Which is interesting, because later in the book, you give Aomame a gun. Why did you do that?HM: I wasn’t going to, but her friend Ayumi, the policewoman, said something that suggested the idea to me. She was talking about the Steve McQueen film, “The Getaway”, and she mentioned “a wad of bills and a shotgun”.IG: And Ayumi says that Aomame looks like Faye Dunaway holding a machine gun.HM: Yes, but more importantly, Aomame says, “I don’t need a machine gun”.IG: So I guess she wasn’t just talking about kicking guys in the balls.HM: That’s right, I had to give her a gun.IG: Well, Godard says, “All you need for a movie is a gun and a girl.”HM: The idea goes back further than that, to Chekhov.IG: Really?HM: Yes, not so much guns and girls, but guns generally.IG: I think Tamaru gave her the gun.HM: Yes, but he also quoted Chekhov, “Once a gun appears in a story, it has to be fired.”IG: So the gun…HM: Stop, I’m sorry, that would be a spoiler.IG: Um, Tamaru is quite an interesting character. He’s the one who suggests that Aomame should read Proust’s “In Search of Lost Time”.HM: She was supposed to be in hiding for three months.IG: So she had plenty of time on her hands.HM: Yes, someone once said that, unless you’ve been in jail or had to hide out for a long time, you can’t read the whole of Proust.IG: Is Proust still relevant to modern readers? How do you relate to his work?HM: Very relevant, with one qualification. It feels like I’m experiencing someone else’s dream. Like we’re simultaneously sharing feelings. But I can’t really grasp what it means to be simultaneous. Our feelings seem extremely close, but in reality there’s a considerable gap between us.IG: Many critics say the same about your novels.HM: They do.IG: How do you react to these comments?HM: I send them a box of madeleines.IG: Good one. This interview wouldn’t be complete without a plug for GoodReads. Do you realize you’re very popular with Good Readers?HM: I’m very popular with most readers.IG: Ha ha. But not Paul Bryant.HM: Him, the one who would be a parodist!IG: You’ve got to admit he is pretty funny.HM: He’s no funnier than his raw material, and I am his raw material.IG: How do you think you should respond to readers like Paul?HM: I parody them.IG: Really?HM: Yes, I’ve parodied him in “1Q84”.IG: His review of “The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle”?HM: Yes, tell me what you think of this, I can even recite it by heart:""Tengo had been all but lost in the work for some time when he looked up to find it was nearly three o’clock. Come to think of it, he hadn’t eaten lunch. He went to the kitchen, put a kettle on to boil, and ground some coffee beans. He ate a few crackers with cheese, followed those with an apple, and when the water boiled, made coffee. Drinking this from a large mug, he distracted himself with thoughts of sex with his older girlfriend. Ordinarily, he would have been doing it with her right about now. He pictured the things that he would be doing, and the things that she would be doing. He closed his eyes, turned his face against the ceiling, and released a deep sigh heavy with suggestion and possibility.""“IG: No. Nobody would think Paul Bryant wrote that.HM: I would love to argue the point, but I’m afraid this is my stop and I’ve got to get off.Black Cat: Miaow, too (this is a Meowlingual translation of something that sounded like ""Nyaa-Nyaa"").Paul Bryant's Review of ""The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle"" ...is here:http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...Go there, read it, like it and return."
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5753689-sean,Rating 4 out of 5,"SeanI must confess that this is my first bold step into the world of Haruki Murakami. After roughly four weeks, my journey through the world of 1Q84 has come to end. I was unfamiliar with this author until this massive yet stunningly beautiful book showed up on the new releases table at the bookstore. I then learned that this author (famous in Japan but relatively unknown in America) titled this book as play on George Orwell’s 1984 (one of my favorites). So I decided to brave the 984 pages.1Q84This fantasy/romance story takes place in Tokyo in the year 1984 and follows two protagonists, Tengo and Aomame, and their quest to find each other. The only way they can do so is by entering the surreal world of 1Q84. As they both realize that they are not in same world as before, they then begin to ponder the peculiarities of the new world and wonder if they, in fact, are the only ones that are aware that they are in 1Q84.SeanAs I began reading the first hundred pages or so, I was extremely curious about where this story was going. Two people, lost in this alternate reality, not really sure what the future holds with them. With much repetition in the story and lots of detail about every action, I thought that it took a lot of time to watch anything happen in the story. After some time, I then became skeptical whether this story would really hold my interest for another 700 pages. I even considered giving up at one point. I decided that since I had already finished 200 pages, I just had to continue.1Q84The story switched back and forth between these two protagonists and we eventually learn that each character lives very similar lives. They are both caught up in immoral circumstances and question their actions. Other characters enter the story and all play a critical role in the decisions that the protagonists choose to make. By book 2, the underlying mystery of the story is revealed and the reader eventually learns the motives among all of the characters in the story. SeanAs I was well into book 2, this book became very interesting. I began to understand the many methods of duality Murakami uses in the story: Tengo/Aomame, 1984/1Q84, talk/solitude, birth/death, large moon/little moon, etc. As the mystery of the book is revealed, I also realized that the underlying mystery really isn’t what this book is about. I deduced that this book is really an exploration of many existential themes of human existence and duality. 1Q84At the very center of this story is the theme of loneliness and longing. Other themes explored are parent/child relationships, sexual promiscuity, adultery, fraud, morality, religion, violence, and childhood nostalgia. All of these themes are concocted with simple yet beautiful prose. As a result, Murakami has created a great story that explored much of the dark side to human nature.Sean and 1Q84It is unclear to me how personal this novel really is to Haruki Marukami. Whether or not these themes are explored based on his personal experience, I could not determine. Nevertheless, Murakami has crafted a complex book that will leave me tossing around many of these themes in my head. Overall, I enjoyed 1Q84 and believe that my time reading this huge 984 page opus was never irretrievably lost."
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6014887-richard,Rating 3 out of 5,"I bought this shortly after New Year's. I can tell you from what bookstore I bought it. I could point out approximately (but not exactly) the rack from which I selected it. I remember the person who accompanied me at the time. I don't know exactly what I was wearing—but it was probably a sweater of some sort with a t-shirt underneath, worn but serviceable dress pants and well polished brown or black shoes. I know that my clothes were fitting well, and were not too snug, because my recent efforts at losing weight had met with somewhat more than moderate success, even though I'd just come through the Christmas holidays. I don't remember what my friend was wearing but it was probably jeans, a t-shirt and a denim jacket. I could tell you a lot of my friend's back story, although he probably would not appreciate it, and in any case it is not relevant to the review, except indirectly. I don't remember whether there was music playing in the store, how many people were in the line up at the cashier, what the woman who took my money was wearing, or whether the bills I gave her were freshly minted or creased and crinkled. I do know that there was a significant discount on the book, which was a factor that contributed to my buying it. If (in some sort of alternate reality version of our world) I lived in Japan and were enrolled in a creative writing course taught by a doppelganger of Mr. Murakami, I would no doubt flunk out. Spectacularly."
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5885760-andrew-smith,Rating 5 out of 5,"Update - 4 years on...Can it really be that long ago? It's a book I listened to over a period of weeks, over 40 hours worth of the normal Murakami mix of sex, food and parallel dimensions. But that's barely scratching the surface. It's a book that still haunts me, though in truth I can no longer recall much of the detail. I do remember that at heart the narrative is a simple one: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy searches for girl - though this might just be the only simple thing about this book. I know I'll have to listen to it again - and I really do think that audio is the ideal vehicle for Murakami's longer, more complex pieces - probably within the next 12 months. I know it'll call me back.--------------------------------------An epic, magnificent and surreal love story. A quiet maths teacher realises he loves a girl he has barely spoken to who, unbeknown to him, has become a contract killer. The story unfolds through the eyes of these two and a third character. It moves slowly - well, it's got plenty of room at something like 1200 pages - and sometimes nothing of any consequence happens for quite some time. The whole thing is complex and surprising. It's beautifully told and I found myself able to accept and even welcome the more bizarre elements.In Murakami's best novels (and this one certainly qualifies) the sense of not knowing where he's going to take you and what it's going to feel like when you get there is exhilarating. I know this book divides opinion but I believe it to be quite brilliant!"
25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/406701-nate-d,Rating 1 out of 5,"Updated, April 2012. Long theory explained in the spoiler section in the middle...The odd thing about this book is that whether I like it or hate it hinges on a particular point of interpretation, one that I'm not really sure is meant to be dissected the way I'm doing. As such, I literally can't tell if this is a good book operating by rather obscure and crafty methods, or a bad, actually rather reprehensible book, operating by more straight-forward means. The fact that it's Murakami, someone I'm pretty sympathetic to, and who is not usually dumb or simple or reprehensible, makes me want to believe the former, but I feel like it'd be way too easy to miss the things that make this so. Hmmmm. Talk to me, Murakami readers.(Several months later: I do hope that the lameness of the later book was rooted in some kind of post-modern feminist angle, but it seems admittedly doubtful, and contradicts what I know about Murakami's meandering, often under-directed working methods, which are always present, even in the better work, in the inability to write an ending).Basically, the first half of 1Q84 seems like pretty good Murakami all around. More plot-driven and obviously interconnected than usual, but unusually gripping for a while. And of our leads, Aomame initially seems interesting and unique for Murakami (especially vs. Tengo, a typically lost, empty 30ish Murakami avatar). And thematically, Murakami seems to be dealing with some pretty worthwhile social issues, both for Japan and elsewhere. Also, there's this neat post-modern dimension that really bears some consideration. (Actually, it's these post-modern nuances and intrigues that make the more straight-forward-seeming plotting promise something weirder and more surprising to come).THEN, though, that gripping plot? It climaxes in the very middle of the book and unspools. Of the mysteries and intrigues set up in the first half, few will really be revisited. The book enters a holding formation, and when it comes out, the plot has jumped tracks. Or off the tracks, pretty much. But that's not all so serious, necessarily. Much more damaging, all the thematics I liked in the first half seem to have jumped tracks too, into something that is actually diametrically opposed to the first half of the story as I had read it. The force of this opposition is so strong that, to me, it either destroys the book, or is secretly allied with the first half in a scathing criticism of the reader accepts it too readily.I want to be more specific here, now (also added later): Basically, the first half of the book seems to circle around stories of abused women and systematic misogyny in Japanese society. Lack of job advancement, viciously domineering and destructive marriages, and even the amazing girl writer has to be re-written by a man to make her marketable. It's all right there. Is this important to talk about? Absolutely. And then? The middle muddles up the themes a bit by making our focus-of-misogyny cult leader a conflictingly semi-sympathetic character and then everything dissolves into the most casually misogynist of setups: Aomame, cold purposeful avenger against masculine aggression, is reduced to waiting endlessly for a man, her new sole purpose in life. And worse, bearing his child. By now the plot is doing nothing, too, of course, but I'm far more enraged by this disregard for the themes. It's absolutely baffling to me. Who, least of all Murakami, could be satisfied by this? Or by the ending that fulfils all this inexplicable waiting? Yet, where are all the angry women readers? Why are we accepting this?It was all so baffling to me that I started thinking there was a chance I was supposed to be mad. (think: Michael Haneke's Funny Games, a movie carefully calibrated to antagonize the viewer for thematically elegant reasons). What if the second half was designed to support the first half by prodding outrage? The greatest possible support for this is in that post-modern angle: earlier in the book, there's every suggestion that Aomame's story is in fact the novel that Tengo is writing. Details from his life inexplicably permeate hers (Chekhov and Janacek are the two most obvious cases), and the whole of the 1Q84 world-detail is explicitly drawn from Air Chrysalis. Later, Tengo gets drawn in as well. At first, this was just a source of weird, thrilling post-modern intrigue and questioning of reality. But in the second half it could be vital. Though the overt references to Aomone's reality being written around her drop away after the mid-point (another reason for second-half boredom), assume that Tengo is still writing her story (afterall, the manuscript returns at the end: it's the one thing he carries with him!). Then everything that disgusts me is turned around. Tengo's misogynist tendencies drag Aomame into a twilight existence where she loses all of her sense of purpose and anger and is reduced to waiting for him, lovestruck. This is such a terrible male fantasy, it seems obvious. The real object of his desire has not been dreaming about him for the last 20 years, to be sure. So he writes her into a stifled projection, cutting off all of her independence and interest as he goes. It's brutal, an act of violence. One that in every way equals the violence against women in the first half. Thus bringing the whole book together into a cohesive whole. Even the iffier bits of the first half are cast in new light: Aomame's beautiful, deadly female assassin is revealed as another kind of reductive male projection, one we see lots of in Japanese pop-culture. And her previously sort of inexplicable tendency to compare breast size with her friends is revealed as, in fact, Tengo's objectifying gaze, once again.Why spend half a book on such a trick? Again, maybe postmodern tactics. Annoy the reader into revolt (like mine!) and they're forced to confront their own complicity in accepting everything up til that point. Come on: did any of you start out rooting for Aomame and Tengo, then find yourself disgusted by going along with the total de-toothing of her character? I expect the pregnancy bit must have pushed someone past their breaking point. Please, someone else corroborate this. Until then, I can't really be sure if this book could be a clever post-modern feminist tirade and maybe actually socially important (the counterpart to the way Wind-Up Bird Chronicle deals with Japan's post-war identity crisis and tendency to bury or forget the gory details of its past), or if it's just muddledly reprehensible, ill-thought-out crap. All of this interpretation seems both deeply worked into the book, but also maybe totally labored and implausible. I really don't know anymore at this point which one I believe. Unfortunately, I'm tending towards hating it.Seriously, I'm stumped. Did he really spend some 400 pages in semi-secret attack on his own story and readers? Are the readers expected to catch on and learn from the experience? Are even a fraction likely to do this if it is so? It's either a one-star book (self-defeating, obnoxious, thematically problematic), or maybe more like a 3.5 star book (super clever and harsh, but why write your longest book as a trick?). Can't decide. If you have theories, let's talk."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1642452-kenny,Rating 5 out of 5,"Loneliness becomes an acid that eats away at you. 1Q84 ~~ Haruki Murakami4.5/5Selected by Srđan for March 2021 Big Book Read After finishing War and Peace I had planned on reading Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain for my next big read of 2021. But I thought the styles might be too similar for back-to-back reads. I mentioned I was thinking of 1Q84 to my friend, Srđan. Being a huge Murakami fan, he enthusiastically urged me to tackle 1Q84 telling me it was an amazing read. When a friend is that passionate about a book, one has no choice but to take the plunge. And as with all Murakami books, the reader is literally taking a plunge since you have no idea what world, or in some cases, worlds you'll end up inhabiting.I became so invested in 1Q84, I finished all 925 pages in seven days. And now that I have finished it, I have no idea what to say or how to write this review. 1Q84 takes place in a surreal world, filled with peculiar characters, talking cats, large penises, a plethora of pubic hair and lots of jazz ~~ add to this a religious cult, secret passageways, and various chrysalises, and you know you are in Murakamiland. What Murakami has given us in 1Q84 , is a tightly plotted, metaphysical monster of a fairy tale. Murakami has said he wants to blend Dostoevsky with Raymond Chandler in his work, and he has done so brilliantly in 1Q84 with a triple dose of religious mysticism, assassins, murders and detectives, and Little People.This tale begins with a woman named Aomame ~~ which means green pea in Japanese. She is stuck in a taxi on a jammed expressway in Tokyo in 1984. All we are told is Aomame is on a mission and has to get somewhere, no matter what, by a certain time. The driver tells her about an emergency ladder by which she can descend to street level and catch a subway train, which she does, but by so doing she has emerged into another world, almost exactly like our own except for certain historical differences and the two moons in the night sky. Using a Japanese pun between the numeral nine and the letter Q, she dubs this world 1Q84.It is the story of how Aomame and a boy, Tengo, she once held hands with in elementary school, are eventually drawn back together, in the world of 1Q84, via the machinations of a religious cult called Sakigake, which has established a connection with the creepy Little People. Sakigake hires a private detective named Ushikawa ~~ an incredibly ugly man with crooked teeth and a huge misshapen head, to track Aomame down, for reasons I cannot divulge under order of the Little People.1Q84 has its problems. The dialogue becomes preachy at times. Characters and plot elements pop in and out for no reason, with no resolution. 1Q84 builds to an excruciating climax in the second section, then starts over in the third section for reasons known only to Murakami. And lastly, the ending is rushed. But, with all that said, I highly recommend 1Q84. It is a suspenseful and bizarre book which will surely captivate you right from the start. The mysteries left unsolved add up ~~ as they do with all Murakami books ~~ to the beauty of the reading experience ~~ and you might end up like me, thinking every time you look at the moon How would it be to suddenly see two moons in the sky?"

Update:
 I know i have only read one Murakami book like four times and i am in no way eligible enough to say that i am a true fan but please believe me when i say this : If there is one other person, besides Steve Jobs, who is my role model then it's Haruki Murakami. And i am trying my best to make time and read his books ya know.
Review:


“If you can love someone with your whole heart, even one person, then there's salvation in life. Even if you can't get together with that person.”

Love. It transcends dimensions. Even though Murakami has created a bizarre world, a completely different world, still, in the end, it all came back to a love story. But this is unlike anything I have ever read. After completing this book, as i lay down on my bed i thought i heard a whisper. I thought i heard someone speak.And Ho-Ho.They were the The Little People. They were building their Air Chrysalis. The huge womb-like thing that materializes out of their hands.And then I spoke.Oh how I spoke.I spoke about Tengo and Aomame.About Fuka-Eri. About the book she wrote. How it was a catalyst for everything.About Sakigake. The religious cult.About Ushikawa, Leader, Buzzcut and Ponytail, Tsubasa, Professor Ebisuno, and the three nurses that Tengo meets. And oh how could i forget The Little People.I spoke about the Little People while they made their Air Chrysalis.And then I spoke about love. How all this was still a love story.How, even though the world had changed, love was still there. Because Love. . .in the end it transcended all dimensions.And then I closed my eyes.And when i woke up the Little People. . .they were gone.I have no idea how Murakami has created such a beautiful thing. If someone asked me whether I would recommend this book to them i would tell them to try Murakami's other ""shorter"" books first because Murakami is definitely an acquired taste. It is slow burn and there are no action scenes.But. . .There are Cat towns. And the three witches from Macbeth.And that person who knocks on Aomame's door.And moon-crossed lovers.And a different world.And connections. How connections once made will stay forever.

“That's what the world is , after all: an endless battle of contrasting memories.”

29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6152723-nags,Rating 3 out of 5,"Phew. Reading this book is like being in a bad marriage but you can't decide if it's actually bad or not. It started out fantastic. I was engrossed in it and couldn't wait to get home from work every day to just cuddle up with the book in hand. Somewhere along the way, I lost a bit of interest and started thinking about the other unread books in my list. I was tempted to cheat but persevered and gave it my full attention. Some days were great, some days were bad. Some so bad that I skimmed. There's a lot of sex (and an obsession with breasts) along the way too but what really got to me was the fantastical parts of the book. I wish it wasn't so... silly. Yes, that's the word I choose to use although it may not necessarily describe it. The writing is brilliant, the characters are great, but some of the actual ideas, not so much. With all these ups and downs, I managed to hold on to the love I felt in the beginning and guess I largely succeeded because I did finish it. The translation work is fantastic and often made me wonder how they did it so well, especially where references are made to particular words. I think this book taught me something. I can't commit to a long book fully. I am a skimmer and I am made that way. This book probably deserves a 4-star rating at least, and a better reader than me. So now that I am done, I am going to let go. I hope you enjoy it and know that you are very lucky to have a go at it! "
30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,Rating 4 out of 5,"More than the author’s usual magical realism, this novel crosses over into science fiction: people can be born in a cocoon; there are “Little People” who crawl out of dead bodies and there are two moons. The title is a take-off from Orwell’s “1984.” Yet none of that is necessary to the plot or the structure of the story. A young woman is an assassin hired to kill a religious cult leader with his assent. She is pregnant by (choose one) her boyfriend, the cult leader or maybe the Little People, but in any case the cult thugs are after her to get the baby. They hire an ugly dwarf private investigator to help them find her and he becomes the star of the story – the most fully developed character and in some ways, the one we can most identify with. Chapters written in the first person alternate among the three main characters: the young woman, the young man and the investigator. There really isn’t a lot of plot and I would not call the story “riveting,” but it kept my attention. Like the author’s novel, Kafka on the Shore, the story pays more homage to Western culture than to Japanese culture. "
31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7915003-garima,Rating 4 out of 5,"By the time one decides to read their third or fourth Murakami book, a certain set of expectations already springs up in the form of a private blurb statement which readily signifies that the emergence of a familiar pattern is lined up ahead. A pattern where rearrangement of different elements become inevitable but the prospect of discovering something new turns out to be the key reason for returning to a world where 'suspension of disbelief' is duly carved at the entry point. Whether that world is illuminated by the radiance of two moons or hundred suns, if it’s the magical creation by one of my favorite writers then I simply excuse myself from the tedious reality and get ready for the mystifying charm of another surreal tale. And 1Q84 is no exception.An alphanumeric year, few entangled lives, one ardent love story - what we have is a lengthy book with no shortage of imagination. Murakami’s passion for storytelling really shines through his works. His main art lies in the ability to create a hypnotic yet germane atmosphere wherein his ingenious vision of a parallel universe and the unique mélange of characters is primarily a by-product of our social order /disorder only. He gives fantastical expression to his ideas and gradually proclaims his purpose chapter by chapter, book by book. So what is that 'new' which 1Q84 gave me? It’s difficult to summarize this trilogy but as a reader and an admirer, it gave me an opportunity to recognize the depth of Murakami as a writer. He’s immensely popular as popular can get but I gauged a childlike excitement in his writing. A willingness to stretch his limitations and making them join hands with his strengths. 1Q84 is a subtle examination of desire and how that desire perpetuates both good and evil. It’s a careful contemplation of an inconspicuous planet and how it’s capable of foreshadowing our everyday life. It’s a clever conformity with the world which Orwell predicted and Dostoyevsky imagined. It’s an ode to the crazy notions of love and I love ‘love’. For the most part, what others probably found irritating was a source of friendly comfort for me. What others must have dismissed as silly brought a laughing fit for me. What was never-ending for others was a matter of ceaseless joy for me. But with so much good, there is a good scope for mistakes too. There are apparent flaws here concerning some sensitive issues, which when gets exposed to the cynical red light develops into several problematic images. How one construes those images is a crucial but complicated task for readers and when a book turns out to be 1000+ pages long there should be no surprise if it attracts 1000+ interpretations too. In any case, one surely stands to gain a lot. This book however gained 4 stars and all my discontent, my sarcastic laughs, my rolling of eyes moments and my little disappointments are condensed into one single star which I’m keeping as a bookmark for my next Murakami novel.

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian,Rating 3 out of 5,"Early on, I begin to think aloud, “Murakami sure makes redundancy necessary—attractive even.” Then 700 pages later on, my expectations are blown to smithereens. Before the strenuous trek, though, I had thought that Murakami’s über-simple prose made reading a true joy: reading for hours in a trance that only the best of books can inspire is almost as rare as a decent meal at a fast food joint. ""1Q84 (again, early on… perhaps before page 400 or so) was like a delectable miniseries—you know, the ones that rival the silver screen in their artfulness—each teeny moment was overstuffed, nicely, of course, with drama. Soon, Murakami turns into a bit of a chore though—we go around in circles and the most miniscule of details are overemphasized, revisited, reinterpreted, &, in the end, all of it meaning absolutely nothing. Loose ends? For an overwritten hunk of cheese, there are more loose ends at the ends of this than anything by David Lynch. 1Q84 is risky (but NOT--it must be said--risqué) and the surreal details soon turn into a too intense focus on all things (Japan-circa-1984) mundane. There is, sadly, no glorious payoff after so many pages of droll teeter tottering. It's unnecessarily l-o-n-g for all the wrong reasons (mainly, no one nowadays can tell this titan of lit what to do—he goes unaided in the editing). A point comes (for me a tad too late—perhaps page 750 or so) when your enthusiasm has fully depleted. For a Murakami, this is a tad too vanilla—even the climax is so much like the end of the Twilight saga (i.e. insipidly anticlimactic & uninteresting) that it made me, well sad. Not zen."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. Just wow. I admit to being slightly intimidated by the idea of reading this novel. I read a novella of his from before and while I thought it was stylistically pretty great, I didn't FALL for it as I fell for this.Haruki Murakami's longer fiction is amazing. :) It is smooth, full of great ideas, magical without being pretentious. And especially for it being closer to a mainstream book than a fantasy, I was worried it was going to wind up being something like a David Mitchell book.But no. I thought it was a great pleasure to read from the first page to the last. So, yeah, the great bits and great ideas abound. It's not just an easy and fun read, it's about a fantastic female assassin revenging abused women, it's about literary fraud, it's about slipping between dimensions and dealing with the Little People, Air Chrystali, religious cults, Receivers and Perceivers, and best of all, it's about a love that transcends time.Sound great? It is great. I never once got bored.It's a near-perfect blend of reality in Japan in 1984, sometimes altered in dimension, and a fantastic shout-out to old SF, modern magical realism, and epic transcendental love. :) Totally recommend.

Pioneer in the Mazophilous* Fantasy Genre
 [*mazophilous-- an ""abnormal sexual focus on female breasts, or a breast fetishism""]To my female goodreads friends, in a few paragraphs I hope to explain the two rating so please bare with me, and don't assume the negative and bust me for being male. I've been honest and candid in all my reviews, so I'm not about to make a boob of myself here. This novel must be THE pioneer in mazophilous literature, a/k/a mazolit.I've racked my brain and don't recall reading anything approaching this type of obsession in a literary novel by an estimable author: the female breast as an incandescent symbol repeated and varied in its iterations throughout the novel. The female protagonist is a twiggy 30-something physical therapist/masseuse, who is also a part-time assassin of abusers of women and children. Named Aomami (meaning, literally, ""green beans""), she has frequent internal dialogues about female bosoms, the small size of her breasts and the resulting inferiority complex she suffers; she even ""mourns"" the loss of the breasts of 2 murdered women [if you think I'm lying, ask someone who has read this]. Aomami experienced puppy love in grade school with the male protagonist but hasn't seen him since they were both 11. The cast also includes ""little people"" borne from a goat's mouth; a butterball of a reclusive cult leader who harbors a death wish; his doll-faced 17-year-old daughter with a stone-like personality and an ample bosom who can serve as surrogate sex partner in storms; a very top-heavy lady law enforcement officer who suffers nymphomania; a married middle-aged woman with ""pyriform mammaries"" [look, I promise you I'm not making this up] and an abnormal possessiveness of her young beau, who is the male protagonist, a part-time writer who teaches a cram course in math; a pestering, porcine private investigator; and, the protagonist's father, a cable bill collector, whose malevolent doppelganger bangs on doors for hours as he harasses the two female leads.Good news for me was that I could finally check the box by Haruki Murukami's name on my list of 1,000 authors to read before I die. I knew from reading descriptions of his novels that I was in for a story that was likely phantasmagoric. I settled on 1Q84, despite its enormity - 928 pages originally published in Japan as a series of 3 novels.While the book generally maintained my interest, I could not shake off my wish that I was finished every time I picked it up. I'm pretty sure if I'd been more attuned to the parallel universe created (called 1Q84 or land of 2 moons), I'd have appreciated its plethora of symbols and literary structure.I wouldn't read it again."
35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613919-jason,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 StarsHaruki Murakami may well be the most technically gifted story teller in the world today. I am such a huge fan, and love every minute that I spend in his imaginative worlds. His works bend genre lines, and twist between fantasy, science fiction, historical literature, and fairy tale in nature. He writes novels that transport the reader to places that they have never been before. This book 1Q84, is no exception. It is a love story that transcends time and space and questions reality itself. It is an ethereal, imaginative, and lyrical tale about long a lost love from childhood. It is filled with the unexpected, with “Little People”, and with fantastical tales. Many themes persevere throughout this tome, but “Things are not what they seem” lies at the heart of the story. I am always blown away at how poetic Murakami’s writing is: “The hothouse air was warm and humid and thick with the smell of plants. Hundreds of butterflies flitted in and out of sight like short-lived punctuation marks in a stream of consciousness without beginning or end. Whenever she came in here, Aomame felt as if she had lost all sense of time.”It can be lyrical and delicious too:“Tengo chopped a lot of ginger to a fine consistency. Then he sliced some celery and mushrooms into nice-sized pieces. The Chinese parsley, too, he chopped up finely. He peeled the shrimp and washed them at the sink. Spreading a paper towel, he laid the shrimp out in neat rows, like troops in formation. When the edamame were finished boiling, he drained them in a colander and left them to cool. Next he warmed a large frying pan and dribbled in some sesame oil and spread it over the bottom. He slowly fried the chopped ginger over a low flame.”There is a great deal of symbolism that is repeated throughout this novel that adds depth and meaning to this story.“A trace of fatigue was discernible in his voice. “One thing should be perfectly clear. My wife is irretrievably lost. She can no longer visit your home in any form. That is what I am saying.””The main story contains a great deal of religious overtones, involves cults, and god theology. In a poignant chapter involving Ushikawa and Tamaru, Ushikawa quotes Carl Jung, “Cold or Not, God Is Present!” They then have a philosophical discussion on the meaning of this that coincides well with the pulse of this story.This is a huge book that is really three books in one. Books numbers one and two are nearly flawless and are a pinnacle achievement from the master story teller Murakami. The concluding third book seemed out of place. It was terribly slow, introduces an unnecessary third POV, and to me, made our protagonists make contradicting character type decisions. Like all Murakami novels there are so many layers that need to be peeled back like an onion to reach the core. The characters are all created and made to seem real, to be likable, and to be identifiable. The supporting cast is colorful and adds a great deal of profundity to this masterpiece. There is a tremendous amount of symbolism and many themes to talk about. Powerlessness might have been the main theme that drove the story forward as all of our protagonists and antagonists suffered from it to one degree or another.There is simply too much to talk about and to summarize to do any justice to this gem. It is a shame that the third book went in the direction that it did, as this would have been a true masterpiece. To me this was the best written novel of 2011, and will be my favorite of the year. You will be thinking about it long after you finish this massive read. I love Murakami and hope that if you have never read his works before that you will give him a try.""Ho Ho""."
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter,Rating 4 out of 5,"It's so much easier when books leave me with a very clear idea of what I want to say about them. It's much more difficult when I don't find that one hook that I want to rant about or laud to the skies.I'm sort of in that position with 1Q84. I enjoyed it, as I always enjoy Murakami, while being at the same time slightly befuddled about it. His books are a little like reading dreams - weird as all get out, with dream logic that makes sense in context, but make me feel foggy and unsure about what happened by the light of day.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the recent changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

Told over three books, I found some of the sections stronger than others but I was overall very immersed in this story. This book has very polarizing reviews and honestly I get it. I didn't love the male gaze in this novel but I can look past it for the sake of a good story. However I make no excuses for the underage sexualization. It's not necessary for the narrative and the story likely would have been a five star read without it. The last section also focused on a lot of womanly issues I didn't care about. Yet, despite so many negatives in this review, I can't stop thinking about it. There's a lot to love about this novel and I just wish I could widely recommend it."

39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a long and somewhat repetitive read, but still very rewarding. Murakami’s prose is as poetic as always full of beautiful analogies, musical references, interesting symbols, fascinating parallels, and enigmatic characters. It is a work of meta-fiction combining the idea of a book-in-a-book (Air Chrysalis) and an alternative timeline (the eponymous 1Q84 in parallel to the real 1984.) There is also a drawn-out, but a powerful love story that links the 3 books together. There are two primary characters, Aomine and Tengo who met as 10-year-olds and the 20 years later are embroiled, unknowingly into the Segaguka cult’s spiderweb (if I misspelled these, it is because I listened to it as an audiobook with three narrators.)Months later, this book still echoes in me quite often.

40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2863914-joel,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is the first new Murakami book since I started reading Murakami. --About six months after I finished this book, and I've just lowered the rating. Why, why have I done this? 1Q84 was a Murakami marathon, and by the time I finally finished it, I think I was experiencing a runner's high. Now I've started to notice all the associated aches and pains.Like, why was this marathon so long? It was certainly a lot longer than 26 miles, and even then, I am pretty sure I ran a bunch of those miles twice. Murakami is famous as a seat-of-the-pants writer. He just sits down and starts writing and eventually the story tells him when to stop, which is only sometimes when he has reached the ending. In some ways, this narrative is one of his more linear and comprehensible. Lots of weird things happen, but the plot more or less makes sense even on a first reading, unlike, say, Kafka on the Shore, which makes no sense at all unless you make huge, huge allowances like ""nothing made sense because dream logic!"" and even then, try getting two people to agree on what it all means.So I think I was happy that 1) I finished and 2) I basically understood the plot. And, I guess, 3) Murakami's writing is, as usual, alluring, hypnotic, hyper-detailed and evocative. He writes very flat prose (in translation, at least), and never met a simile he didn't take home to bed and make sweet, passionate love to, resulting in yet more hundreds of tiny simile babies to populate his pages, but he's as easy and enjoyable to read as ever. But while this book has its brilliant bits (the town of cats, the image of the air chrysalis, and a few tense assassinations), it is also very repetitive. Very very repetitive. Repeating the same things, over and over, not just saying them once but again and again. Usually with the exact same imagery. Which is fine. Except when your novel is 1,000 pages. The repetition maybe starts to look a little sloppy then. Especially when a large section just repeats a bunch of stuff you already know from a slightly different point of view, and then that part just kind of fizzles out, and you're all, ""Ok, there was some nice writing there, an interesting character, but... eh?"" Which is a lot of the book: Eh? Narrative dead ends. Lots of dull sex scenes. A romance at its core that kind of makes no sense. Eh.Mostly, the book just left me feeling tired of the author. I didn't even have the energy for a review, let alone the kind of creative noodling that I have enjoyed putting together in lieu of reviews of some of his other books. Granted, I have read nearly all said books in less than three years, but my previous pace didn't bother me at all. This one was exhausting, and it reads like it exhausted Murakami too. I honestly don't know if he has anything left to say. Or say to me, anyway. "
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34428697-joanne-harris,No Rating,"Having read so many Murakami books, I suppose I ought to know what to expect by now: but the enduring joy of this writer is his ability to wrongfoot, mislead and beguile. Don't read one of his books with the expectation of either a linear plot or a Western-style conclusion: the conclusions, if there are any, are for the readers to draw for themselves. To me, it's an existential love story; a parable about regret; a fantasy of identity and escape: Murakami's most Kafka-esque story so far. But beyond a certain point, deconstruction becomes a futile exercise, stripping away the magic to reveal nothing but paperwork. It's really all about whether you can see the magic or not. I could: in spite of its length and repetitiveness (which frustrating though it is, remains, arguably, an essential part of the narrative), I loved it. One does not take the ghost train with a particular destination in mind. The trick is just to enjoy the ride..."
42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114531-john-whittemore,Rating 1 out of 5,"I was shocked upon reading this book. Is this the same book that I chose after reading all the glowing reviews? One of the early plot lines within the book is the editing of a book that has good ideas, but the writing is weak and in need of help. I can't help but think the same is the case of 1Q84. The book started out well. The novel introduces us to interesting characters facing interesting situations in and interesting new world. Then the plot, characters, and themes go nowhere for hundreds and hundreds of pages. About 70% of this book is characters alone in Tokyo apartments. Most of the text is composed of monotonous descriptions of the food the characters eat, their stretching routines, the clothes they choose to wear each day, and their sleep schedules. Character's ruminate ad nauseum on whether or not their world is real. Questioning reality can make for great literature, but Murakami goes nowhere and does nothing with this idea. He just has the characters just ask the same question again and again. The characters don't develop either. They end the story essentially unchanged from where they started. The key to the story seems to be that the man and woman are meant for each other. He tells us again and again that these two characters that only spoke once and held hands once when they were 10 years old are meant for each other. Both characters state again and again they are secretly in love and long to be reunited. After suffering through hundreds of pages going over their dull lives this reader had to conclude the only reason that they spend so much of the story ruminating on a day long elementary school romance is that their lives during the story are too boring to bear.A fundamental rule of writing is ""show don't tell."" Murakami tells and tells and tells. We are told that these characters are in love but see no evidence as to why. Even when something interesting happens in the plot the characters ruminate on the event another 8 or 9 times until the interesting event becomes as dull and tiresome as the rest of the text. The book abruptly ends when these two are reunited. None of the other plot lines are are brought to any conclusion. The only thing I found remarkable about this book is the amount of repetition. Perhaps those who praised this book felt that if things are repeated again and again they take on greater significance? There are a few small parts of the book that were interesting: the ""Town of Cats"" and the story of the boy emperor and the kingdom beneath the sea. The interesting parts just don't make the long and literarily vacant parts of the book worth trudging through. This is one of the few books I have read that I think would make a better 2 hour movie than the book. Having heard so many good things about Murakami I couldn't help but wonder if this book is just a bad translation, but it wasn't just bland writing that complicated this book. The entire book--plot, themes, character--fell flat in my reading. I don't expect I will invest my time on another book of his. "
43,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11166121-em-lost-in-books,Rating 3 out of 5,"My first Murakami and am glad that I read this world famous author.This is the story of Tengo, a school teacher and an aspiring writer, and Aomame, a gym instructor and an assassin. Initially they seem world apart, nothing in common to tie them but as the story progressed their lives gets tangled in unimaginable ways. There are other characters in this story like Dowager, Fuka-Eri, professor, Komatsu, Tamaru and Ushikawa, all perfectly playing their parts. But the whole story revolves around Tengo, Aomame and a secret religious doctrine Skigake. Now Skigake is where the magic comes from in this story.Story of Tengo and Aomame captured my attention right from the start. Murakami described their day to day life and their past in such beautiful words that I couldn't stop myself from falling in love with them and of course, the author. I was mesmerized. I didn't even complained about the slow pace of the story and how author was going into details for every single event and life of every character. I also loved the parts where described modern day Japan, its culture and history, and how modernization is effecting people, their thinking and lifestyle. I loved the parts where Murakami made his characters talk about books, stories and what they tell readers through Proust, Chekhov, Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky and many more. I loved how Murakami build the mystery in his story and characters. I felt the tension of what was about to happen with each page I turned.But all that I said above happened in the first half of the book. In second half story became dull, repetitive, weird and at points bizarre. Then there were numerous sex scenes and characters kept thinking about their sexual encounters repeatedly. Even Tengo and Aomame got irritating with each chapter that I read toward the end. The only reason that I didn't abandoned it after 80% was because I wanted to know how it all ended, specially the mystery around Little People. I was expecting some real kickass action in the end instead I got an easy escape. I was left bereft as I was expecting so much after that fiery start. All in all it was a good experience and I will read more of Murakami but not anytime soon."

Overall, it made for an enjoyable read though nearing the last third to a quarter it became long-winded and lost much of it's earlier tension and feelings of risk, danger, and wonder."
45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081303-aloha,Rating 5 out of 5,"1Q84, a tome of a book, at surface may seem like a wordy almost 1000 pages that is too long. Its depth might escape a lot of people as a big book with a bunch of words with nothing going on. However, the crafty Haruki Murakami fooled them with its web of subtle complexity. Upon analysis, this is a clever and playful work of epic proportion, saying much without shouting at the reader. Instead, this intelligent and knowledgeable writer cradled the reader gently, lulling the reader with the dreamy, fairy tale metaphysical love story between a well-rounded talented boy and a girl with big, beautiful eyes. They found and lost each other at the age of 10. In their quest to find each other 20 years later, Tengo and Aomame find themselves in a mystical noir fiction as they’re pursued by the shady Ushikawa and the cult group Sakigake.Aomame and Tengo were first linked when the two 10 year olds crossed each other on weekends as they made their rounds door to door, he with his father as he bullied people into paying their NHK television subscription fees, she with her mother proselytizing about the end of the world for their Christian sect. Both children dying inwardly with shame with being made a part of using fear to intimidate people. Unlike Aomame, who was ostracized for having to retain her strict religious codes in school, Tengo was a respected boy, big for his size, and academically talented. Tengo rescued Aomame one day when she was ridiculed publicly in science class. She never spoke to him again after that. But one day, she strode quickly to him and held his left hand with a fierce intensity for ten seconds before she ran off. That pivotal moment initiated their two asexual souls into adulthood. Aomame’s fierce grip caused Tengo to have his first ejaculation afterwards. After that, Aomame had her period and declared emancipation from her parents’ strict religious upbringing. Parting ways shortly after, they never tried to find each other until they both entered the world of 1Q84.One day, Tengo was asked by an editor, Komatsu, to revise a 17 year old girl’s badly written but intriguing journal, Air Chrysalis, for publication. His revision of this fantasy put out a call to Aomame to climb down the expressway stairs into the world of 1Q84. The two moons world of 1Q84 was a magical world influenced by the Little People. Thus, began their metaphysical journey to find one true love.Murakami chose to author stories that contained that “special something” that forces us to ask questions. Komatsu stated to Tengo that fiction has to have that “‘special something,’ an indefinable quality...Stuff I understand perfectly doesn’t interest me...” 1Q84 is no different from other Murakami work that contained his special brand of something. The story moves seamlessly from one reality to another. It is imbued with metaphysical thought, with musings about Einstein’s theory about time, that matter can only be in one space-time at a time, about cause and effect, and about the changing nature of events. He made clear that although this is an illusory world in terms of the fact that it is changeable, it is very real. What this world is does not matter as much as the fact that it is our reality. We all have to make our journey, suffer the pitfalls and experience the triumphs, regardless of what reality we end up in. That reality is very real, and wherever we are in the space-time is our true reality. There are no others, no parallel universe in which our twin self is doing something else. In the conversation between Tengo and his girlfriend, Tengo said that the point of the world of the two moons, the “world that isn’t here”... “is in being able to rewrite the past of the world that is here”, thereby changing the present, as noticed by the changes in the news events that Aomame noticed when she entered 1Q84. The entrance of The Little People affected the world. But the entrance of Aomame and Tengo, and their opposing force of love and faith, changed the face of 1Q84. Whether it’s the reality in which Schrödinger's cat lived, or the reality in which Schrödinger's cat died, the observer has affected the event.Besides musing about reality, 1Q84 also touched on the nature and evolution of consciousness. The world of 1Q84 is, at surface, no different from the world of 1984. Leader said to Aomame that most people are unaware of the change from 1984 or 1Q84. Only a few can see the change. Most people live their usual drudgery, not seeing the magic around them. “If you don’t believe in the world, and if there is no love in it, then everything is phony.” There is only one reality, but a person’s definition of reality depends on the person, and depends on the “inner eye, the eye of the mind.” When Fuka-Eri created her own chrysalis to combat the Little People and entered its passageway, she was uncertain whether she is the dohta, her replicant belonging to the world of 1Q84, or herself (maza), who was born in the reality of 1984. She mused, “Am I really a maza? Couldn’t I have switched places somewhere with my dohta?...How can I prove that I am the real me?” In much the same way for people who are questing,...is it the world of 1984 or the world of 1Q84? The answer seems to be that it doesn’t matter, because wherever you go, there you are. Maybe the better question would be, who am I? Whoever you are and whichever world you are in, you must “go on living in this world” and not be afraid and lose heart.The book also played on our morality, and the ambiguousness of morality and ethics. Is Aomame and the dowager’s planned assassination of abusive men justified? Is it immoral if the Leader had sex with 10 year old girls even if he was paralyzed and the girls are actually replicants meant for a ceremony? And what is our opinion on Tengo having regular sex sessions with his married girlfriend? Aomame picking men up for sexual release? Lesbianism? The lawyer Ushikawa’s acceptance of any job, no matter whether it’s to support criminals?Besides touching on various issues that forced us to do mental and soul-searching gymnastics, Murakami employed several devices to weave coherence and a dreamlike quality to 1Q84. The first and most obvious were the repetition of several imagery. This is not accidental or from the author’s laziness. The repetition, besides being a way of creating a web that unifies into a whole, suggests a synchronicity of events, of coincidences that are not coincidences. The repetitions were meant to paint vivid imagery throughout the story and provide significant clues to the story. The most significant repetition is the image of the moon. The change from one moon to two moons is the change from the world of 1984 to 1Q84. Of the two moons that loomed over the world of 1Q84, the first moon was the usual moon that we know. The second moon had a lopsided shape, was greenish “as though thinly covered with moss.” The girl in the novella Air Chrysalis noticed the two moons in the sky when the little people finished making the air chrysalis, signifying their influence on her world. Although Aomame noticed odd things about the world she entered after leaving the expressway, it was confirmed when she noticed the two moons after spending the night with the police woman. Tengo first noticed the two moon sitting on top of the slide outside where Aomame was hiding, as he longed to find her, his soulmate. He noticed the two moons because he had followed Fuka-Eri’s suggestion to dig deep into his memory, the memory that contained his love for Aomame. The unscrupulous Ushikawa, who had never loved anyone, saw the two moons after encountering Fuka-Eri’s dohta, who is a passageway to the other world, and felt a love he had never felt before. Surprisingly, Ushikawa never really questioned it, but accepted his reality to deal with it. Ushikawa eventually resembled the second moon when his tongue developed a green moss coating, and became a part of 1Q84’s mystery and sacrifice. The shape of the two moons is repeated in Aomame’s flat breasts, Ayumi’s full breasts, Tengo’s memory of his mother’s breasts, and Fuka-Eri’s woman’s breasts on a girl’s body. We were actually first introduced to the image of the two moons via Tengo’s mother’s breasts, when the introduction to Tengo began with his 10 seconds memory of an unknown man, who was not his father, suckling his mother’s breasts. The moon imagery was even repeated in the background music of “It’s Only a Paper Moon”.The potent breast imagery was repeated often, moving from Tengo’s obsession with Aomame’s flat breasts as he masturbates with his left hand that she held, to his mother’s mature maternal yet sexual breasts, with the line fuzzy between flat and full, immature and mature, and asexual and sexual. Were the girls with the immature breasts innocent? The mature Aomame had a girl’s flat breasts. Fuka-Eri, the seventeen year old who wrote Air Chrysalis, had full well-shaped breasts on a girl’s body. Breasts that were meant to attract men’s gazes. The girls who had sexual coupling with Leader were underage, but it was sex without sexual desire, and it was not rape.There were also other repetitions, such as Janáček’s Sinfonietta and the number ten. Janáček’s Sinfonietta’s was Tengo’s highly successful piece for his high school band’s competition, and would be his lasting symbol of “encouragement and protection.” It became the background music throughout the book, as Aomame climbed down the stairway into the world of 1Q84. It became the urgent mating call to Aomame, as she suddenly recognized it even only after a few bars, its music creating a violent stirring within her. Janáček’s Sinfonietta became Aomame’s encouragement music as she hide from the Sakigake cult.In the book’s title, the 1Q looks like a 10. Aomame and Tengo first fell in love at the age of ten when soul love exchanged between them with the clasp of hands. The number ten was sewn throughout the deceptively simple plot. The traffic jam that preceded Aomame’s entrance into 1Q84 had cars traveling at a rate of ten minutes in less than ten yards. She found an emergency turnout that was ten meters ahead, the emergency turnout that contained the stairway into the 1Q84 world. We’re introduced to Tengo via his ten second earliest memory of a man not his father suckling his mother’s breast. His lover was a married woman ten years his senior. For his job, Tengo was required to choose ten works of fiction to bring to Komatsu, the editor. Tengo was given only ten days to revise Air Chrysalis. For that, he purchased a word processor at ten o’clock. Fuka-Eri, the heroine of Air Chrysalis, was ten years old when she was punished by being isolated for ten days. It was that same year that she had incestuous “congress” with her father, the Leader. She ran away to professor Ebisuno when she was ten. The number ten even showed up in the events of the minor characters, such as professor Ebisuno, the dowager and the dowager’s body guard, Tamaru.This love story about the true reality of love and faith can be summarized in Tengo’s determination to find Aomame. “...No matter what happens, no matter what kind of world it may be, no matter who she may be...”, he will find her. Everything can change, the world, your physical manifestation, but your eternal self will always be, powered and strengthened by love and faith.As Fuka-Eri declared to Tengo, once a story “...gets written down, the story is not mine anymore”. Murakami wrote his story with an “indefinable quality” and a “possibility.” He put it out for us to read. It is now ours to interpret the meaning of that “special something” in the book and discover its possibilities. I get a feeling that Murakami has gotten to the point in his life that he writes what is meaningful to him. He forms his air chrysalis to release the Little People into the world like a meme that affects the people reading it. The story is no longer his. How we react to his paper moon world is up to us.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gapCK5...Say, its only a paper moonSailing over a cardboard seaBut it wouldn't be make-believeIf you believed in meYes, it's only a canvas skyHanging over a muslin treeBut it wouldn't be make-believeIf you believed in meWithout your loveIt's a honky-tonk paradeWithout your loveIt's a melody played in a penny arcadeIt's a Barnum and Bailey worldJust as phony as it can beBut it wouldn't be make-believeIf you believed in me"
46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,Rating 2 out of 5,"This is my 9th Haruki Murakami and for me, this book is not really different from those earlier eight. The two alternating narrators (1 for each chapter up to the end of Book 2), Tengo and Aomame reminded me of the interspersing but parallel stories he used in Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World (2 stars). Maybe to make this book a bit different (Wiki says he wrote this for 4 full years), he added the third narrator, Ushikawa whose role seemed to be the most interesting only because he is a lawyer-detective who can do deductive reasoning ala-Sherlock Holmes but he sure is ugly with his misshapen head so the other characters call him Bobblehead. The usual Murakami elements that I've encountered reading the earlier eight are also present here, e.g., people disappearing all so suddenly and without a trace in Sputnik Sweetheart (3 stars), the cats behaving and talking like human beings in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (4 stars), character's isolation from the world and strange loveless sex in Kafka on the Shore (4 stars), voyeurism in After Dark (4 stars) and also in ""Sputnik."" Notice that I used to love Murakami because I was mesmerized to find these elements when I was reading these earlier works. My last Murakami book read was ""Hard-boiled"" and that was in September 2011. I have at least 2 other books by him in my tbr but I hesitated to read them. I thought I had too much of Murakami in just few years and his books were becoming repetitive. However, this book came out in 2010 and the drum beaters said that this was his best. I still did not buy and showed any interest (that's how much disappointed I was with ""Hardboiled""). Until the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die editors dropped ""Kafka on the Shore,"" that I thought was his best work, in favor of this ""1Q84"" from their latest 2012 edition. Oh no, wrong choice!The other thing that I did not particularly like about this book was its repetitiveness. The plot is, to be frank but of course in my opinion, thin. In fact, ""Hardboiled"" has a more intriguing premise and more engaging prose like a good-till-its-last-page kind of thing. It seemed to me that Murakami just wanted to join the ranks of Thomas Pynchon, James Joyce, David Foster Wallace, Roberto Bolano, Vikham Seth and Leo Tolstoy who are all effective in writing short as well as long novels without tiring or boring their readers. So, Murakami spent a lot of time unnecessarily describing the milieus as well as repeating the thoughts of his characters. At times, he was aware of this because he used words like ""parroting"" and ""at the risk of repeating myself"" but oh yes, the characters repeat themselves. Murakami repeats himself as if the readers have low reading comprehension that should be reminded in each chapter lest they would be lost because the novel is very long. An example of this is in page 1148:
""Will you tell me you believe it from the bottom of your heart?"" (said Aomame).""I believe it from the bottom of my heart,"" Tengo replied.
This is not the best example because there were some that after a similar exchange of sentences by his two characters, Murakami would still paraphrase, sometimes using the same words, what the two talked about. Can't Tengo just say ""Yes""? I don't think that would be a lot different. It reminded me of being in grade school when grammar teachers would always require us to answer in complete sentences.But I am not giving this a lone star. This book is hard for me to dislike. First, Murakami is my sentimental favorite author. His books were introduced to me by a dear friend and his ""Kafka on the Shore"" (my first) accompanied me during the time that I was recuperating from my knee operation in March 2010. Second, the book is easy to read. Even if you are in a crowded noisy restaurant, even killing time inside a gym lounge or even in the office during lunch breaks, you can read and understand the book. I guess the book is intended for young people because of the supernatural elements and its sci-fi, easy, relax mood. Lastly, the book is popular and no one looks at you as if you are a demented geek or old-fashioned college professor if anyone sees you reading this book. The cover is hip, the title is intriguing and Murakami is well-known already and his works have a cult-like group of followers in the internet and he has a legion of fans all over the world. Bottom line, I am glad I was able to finish reading this book. However, I will never ever read this again."
47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59050228-meike,Rating 4 out of 5,"This novel is set in two times frames and places at the same time: Tokyo in 1984, and the parallel world of 1Q84, a world which is only perceived by some people in the actual Tokyo, a mysterious realm accessed by those who see the second moon and are ready to navigate peak Murakami (and of course I mean this). Our main characters are Tengo, a math teacher and author, and Aomame, a fitness coach / assassin carrying out feminist revenge missions. They fell in love as children and were torn apart, now they are lonely, deeply alienated grown-ups looking at two moons - and it's no spoiler to say that they will meet again. The question is how and why. This brick of a book consists of three parts, the first two alternating between the viewpoints of Tengo and Aomame, the last one adding the voice of a private detective working for a religious sect (a guy who also features in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle). Yup, there is murder, fanatism, and control, but also love, emancipation and the question of agency and reality: Who gets to tell the story? Who determines what's real?Murakami's classic approach to elevate the imagination to a reality, to manifest emotions in eery occurrences and sights is fully developped in this text: 1Q84 is a dreamscape, but Tengo and Aomame are real, while reality appears ghost-like. It's the kind of twisted mind game that made this author famous, as he approaches consciousness and sub-consciousness in a very specific way, melting away what separates them. Murakami is often under-estimated and misunderstood (e.g. the claim that his literature is ""Westernized"" - what is this even supposed to mean?!), but he is a master who writes approachable literature. I hope many more Japanese authors will pass through the doors that he has opened."

So I wanted to read some Murakami. This weekend I saw two operas: Gluck's Orfeo and Euridyce and Rossini's The Barber of Seville. Does anything have to do with the other? Perhaps it does in Murakami's 1q84 world where there are two moons and little people coming out of goats and horny middle aged nurses that remind a main character of the three witches in Macbeth.This book was a monstrosity of verbiage. On and on and on. I was an exhausted prospector in a river with very few gold nuggets but I searched and searched and searched. When I found one I would become briefly elated only to find out it had very low value so on I searched again for the next one. My thirst was never quenched however despite reading this book for the past three months.Granted I recognize that there is genius in this book. If it were a novella it could have been a minor masterpiece but it was lost in a mucky mess of porridge that to add insult to injury was spoon fed to us the readers. Every detail was listed and then its meaning pointed out to us as if this was a Grade Nine English class reading Romeo and Juliet for the very first time.Despite my frustration I will at some time try another Murakami novel and perhaps be rewarded for the time I spent on this one. I know this is not logical but in the world of 1q84 it may well be."
49,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721021-randomanthony,Rating 4 out of 5,"Reading Murakami's 1Q84 provides a solid middle school reading rate word problem:1Q84 run 925 pages. If you read thirty pages a night, how long will you need to read the novel? Diving into this novel is a commitment. So is the extensive investment of time necessary for full 1Q84 immersion worthwhile? Yes. More than yes, if you're a fan of Murakami's steady, meditative pacing. No, if you're not. Within the first twenty pages you'll know where you stand.1Q84 is arguably Murakami's most action-oriented novel. A few passages read like a pulp detective novel set in Japan. The first two books' chapters alternate the stories of a man and a woman with a long-buried connection. In book three a private detective's perspective emerges as well. But I need to articulate that Murakami at his most action-oriented still feels careful and crafted. 1Q84 is also a novel about writing and writers; Proust and Chekhov, along with the book-within-a-book called Air Chrysalis, take roles of their own. But 1Q84 also features the appearance of two moons, diminutive but human-like beings that emerge from the mouth of a dead goat, and a walk down an emergency stairway on a standstill interstate that changes everything. The author covered elements included throughout 1Q84 in other works. The “dual worlds” concept appeared in both Hard-Boiled Wonderland and After Dark. I'm of the mind that these worlds are subtle and symbolic. I don't believe the two-mooned world is a tangibly different planet. I think, when you make decisions and your perceptions change in subtle and powerful ways, that your world changes as well. And the love manifested by Aomame and Tengo, as well as the shifting perspective of the private investigator tasked with tracking them down, transforms what they see, touch, and feel. It's no accident that Aomame reads Proust. She's seeing with new eyes. Murakami delves deep into Jung as well, especially the concept of shadow. But I don't want to pretend I understand every nuance. I have no fucking idea what the “little people” are supposed to represent. They're creepy as hell. If you are planning on reading 1Q84 plan on letting the surreal rhythms take their path. Don't fight them.Despite the action 1Q84, as with so Murakami's work in general, is often either A) conversational, B) solitary. His characters spend much of their time alone, and Murakami will describe a character's train of thought through a solo afternoon for pages at end. But the conversations between, for example, Aomame and the dowager spur the latter's thinking and propel her inner monologue the next time she's alone. It's a subtle but powerful literary strategy.Murakami critics focus on his slow, sometimes-frustrating “nothing is happening” style. Reading his work requires discipline. So consider 1Q84 a nourishing marathon through surreal, mind-expanding terrain. The suspense and payoff inherent in the last thirty pages are of the “I don't care how late I have to stay up, I'm finishing this book tonight” variety. But you have to wade through 850 pages of Murakami at his most controlled and ambitious to get there. Reading Murakami is more important to me than just reading a book: reading Murakami is an exploration into my own shadow and an intense, reflective state of mind that is very difficult to describe but inherent through the author's work. 1Q84 does not disappoint holistically but could frustrate readers measuring the remaining pages as inches. This is Murakami at his best. A whole lot of Murakami at his best. Almost too much. I'm still recovering."
50,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,Rating 4 out of 5,"1Q84 by Haruki Murakami. This has been on my to-read list for quite some time now. Although I do like most of his stories, his style of writing, his creativity, imagination, and yet still deeply affecting novels, I do not consider myself a cult follower. I actually dislike many of his works, especially those that are completely, arbitrarily, randomly, who knows-ly unexplained, with so many made up, strange things that it was no longer fun. Only my opinion, though. To each their own. Case in point, all the House of Leaves devotees.Reading all the reviews, I was not surprised, but certainly took note of the fact that 1Q84 was being viewed as excessively long, with little clear cut, tangible results. I was deterred since I tend to be a supporter of the ""less is more"" philosophy, and, furthermore, dislike fluff characters, empty scenes, unexplained concepts, needlessly vague endings, and confusion added for the pure sake of confusion.Now that I have finally gotten around to reading 1Q84, I can finally give my much awaited verdict. And that is that 1Q84 undoubtedly has all of those things. But, aside from the excessive length, it was not quite as bad as I feared. As usual, strange and random. As usual, involving a goat (seems Murakami as well as other storytellers have a thing for goats and sheep, possibly from religious histories and the traditional sacrificial sheep/lamb/goat). But there was a magical, whimsical quality to the story that drew me in. That special emotional pull to the characters that is often lacking.Overall, it was a good read. A little less dark than other stores from Murakami, the overarching theme is that Tengo and Aomame are meant to be together. Sweet and something I wholeheartedly agree with, I still wonder why Murakami choose to add so much unnecessary to the simple story with a happy ending. Less is more sometimes, as all writers know. Had 1Q84 been about half the length, it would really have made it to my all-time-favorites.I started this knowing it was a fantasy Murakami book. Meaning that the inexplicable, fanciful, unbelievable, irrational aspects were to be expected. Murakami takes the reader into the world of 1Q84, the ""other dimension"", am obvious reference George Orwell's classic by the same name. 1Q84 is differentiated by the presence of the two moons. It is these two moons that bring Tengo Kawana and Aomame Masami together- our hero and heroine, respectively. Like Orwell's world, the ability to think for ourselves is taken away. ""Thought Crimes"" are to be feared. This organization, Sakigake, is run by a larger man suffering from intense pain daily known only as Leader. They want something from Aomame and Tengo. Not that the two of them know it. They met when they were in fifth grade. They both say, in retrospect, that they fell in love. But the only contact, physical or verbal, that they ever had was Aomame walking into a deserted classroom with a rare determination, and, without a word, grasping young Tengo's hand. Leaving her little hand wrapped around his for what seems like an eternity to both, then walking away. That was it. Now it is clear that in that hand contact a deep connection was made, one that has transcended time, space, dimensions.Aomame's family was deeply entrenched in the ways of the Society of Witnesses (Jehovah's), causing her to be a shunned, quiet girl, who, after waking away from her family that wanted nothing to do with a daughter who was unwilling to give her entire life over to the religion, became an independent, lonely, defensive, hurt woman. Their paths diverged shortly after Aomame’s impulsive and ambiguous gesture, but each was left profoundly changed by it. For the next 20 years, they are held in the gravitational pull of this brief moment of connection.Now they are nearly thirty. Tengo is a math teacher and unpublished novelist, drifting rather aimlessly through his life, with no clear sense of purpose or ambition. Aomame is a fitness instructor, bodyworker and, most importantly, an assassin of men who have violently abused their wives. (The only other Aomame had given her heart to was a girl who was her best friend on the high school softball league. Close enough to try their initial forays into lesbianism together, she later committed suicide after making an abusive husband.)When Komatsu, an unscrupulous and cynical editor, asks Tengo to rewrite a story by 17-year-old Fuka-Eri so that it can be considered for a major literary prize, Tengo realizes he’s entering into a devil’s bargain. But he’s so taken with the story that he is unable to resist Komatsu’s offer. Accepting the task opens up a Pandora’s box of perils that far surpass even Tengo’s and Komatsu’s worst fears. The novel, Air Chrysalis, becomes an immediate best seller, attracting widespread media attention that threatens to uncover Komatsu’s and Tengo’s scam. More ominously, the novel has aroused the ire of the “little people,” a malevolent group of other-worldly miniature spirits.Aomame meanwhile has her own secrets. Employed by an elderly dowager, she stealthily and expertly murders men who have abused their wives but remain unprosecuted. When she accepts the assignment to kill the heavily protected leader of Sakigake (known to all to be Leader, father to Fuka-Eri), the very religious cult that Fuka-Eri had fled and written about in Air Chrysalis, she too enters a world of danger she never could have imagined. (This still would not make much more sense without the context of the entire book, I promise.)Aomame enters the world 1Q84 (rather than 1984, Q for ?) through a secret entrance to the underground train from the side of the expressway. Aomame was on her way to meet an important client. In her line of work, a client is better labeled a victim. Her speciality is a tiny needle she uses to instantly kill victims with precision; she has the gift of touch, which is of great assistance in her ""cover"" career as a personal trainer/acupuncturist. She has literally entered another world, one that is nearly identical to the ordinary world of 1984 except that it has two moons in the sky. And in this new world, the flow of time and the rules of reality have been subtly altered.Blurring the line between possible and impossible, linear and non-linear time, fiction and reality, fate and free will, 1Q84is both a metaphysical mind-teaser and a fast-paced thriller where the stakes for Tengo and Aomame couldn’t be any higher. Murakami’s most ambitious novel to date, 1Q84 is also an extraordinary love story, a story about the power of a single moment of deep connection to transcend time and space—and justify even the greatest of risks.As Aomame’s and Tengo’s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.""Honestly, there is no way to really ""give away"" this novel. Reading it is less about the destination than the experience of seeing, feeling, hearing, sensing the journey. There is no easy way to even summarize what is going on in 1Q84. None of it really makes that much sense after you read it; the best way I have to describe it is that one has an impression that what is illogical could be logical in an illogical world. This is not always the case; stories are typically either categorized for me as magical realism or fantasy/science fiction. Somehow, 1Q84 had managed to fit into both categories equally well.Gratitude paid to Harvard Political Review (https://harvardpolitics.com/running-t...), I have the answer to the question I started this review with, why I liked this far better than other Murakami works, mostly better received and far shorter in length.“Nothing in the real world is as beautiful as a person about to lose consciousness,” writes Murakami in his 2008 memoir, ""What I Talk About When I Talk About Running"". [Still on my To-Read list!]As Murakami ages, it is perhaps impossible to expect the same type of incisive, dramatic surrealism that he originally made his name by. He mentions that he now chugs along but is getting slower and accepting the change with grace. The divide between the real and the fantastic grows closer with every passing work. Even the names of each world have metamorphosed: in his 1991 Wonderland, the fantastic “otherworld” of the protagonist’s conscience is literally named “The End of the World,” while in 1Q84 the difference between settings is merely the changing of one digit to a letter. The deep, crushing loneliness has now been replaced by a calmer, older version—the young man grown up in a world that he knows is different from the one in his past, full of lurking threats and of two sides to every person instead of one.1Q84 is meant for a different audience than Murakami’s earlier works. It is not necessarily for those who felt as if his previous novels stood alone amongst authors as a dive into the darker parts of the soul. It is not necessarily for those who relish reading about a world so different from our own as to be escapist. At the end of the book, you don’t really want to travel to the mystical world Murakami has thrown his characters into. You want to head back home and go to bed during the December of your day. The audience that 1Q84 will attract are a new group of readers, one that is not as familiar with Murakami’s more experimental works and who appreciate the escapism of the routine of every day life. Reading about Aomame in her imposed exile, cooking and reading Proust is comforting; you cheer for Ushikawa to leave so that Aomame and Tengo can be united.Murakami is finally branching out into a type of writing that, while he hasn’t explored as thoroughly, is simultaneously compatible and incompatible with his former works. It is compatible in that he is able to expose traces of the ideas that made him popular to a larger audience in a more accessible format. It is incompatible in that there are less of the incredibly memorable scenarios that define his earlier novels, the haunting darkness eschewed in favor two contemplative characters whose pace rocks slow in 1Q84.The only question that remains is if it is a conscious decision. Has Murakami watered himself down in order to appeal to more readers? Has he accepted a slower pace as he ages? I think the answer lies somewhere in the nebulous region of the latter in that Murakami seems to write more for the audiences. In that, his work is staying true to the man at the moment. Lightbulb! In other words, the woman of this moment, me. Staying true to more of the magical realism and less of the beyond comprehension fantasy. A little less of that dark ridiculousness, so unreal that it can no longer be logical even in an illogical universe. A little more romance, magical realism, even reality in the mundane. Should the assessment be believed, I will only be liking Murakami more as his writing becomes more ordinary as the years inevitably turn."

می‌شویم.وقایع این کتاب در سال ۱۹۸۴ میلادی رخ می‌دهد و شخصیت‌های اصلی کتاب دختری به نام «آئومامه» و پسری به نام «تنگو» هستند که در دوران کودکی در یک مدرسه حضور داشتند و تجربه‌ی گرفتن دست همدیگر به آن‌شکلی که در کتاب می‌خوانیم آغاز ماجراهای عاشقانه‌ی آن‌ها سال‌ها سال بعد در ۱۹۸۴ خواهد بود.در این کتاب با دو دنیا مواجه خواهیم شد:نخست دنیای واقعی در سال ۱۹۸۴ که اگر سوزن به بدن خود فشار دهیم بی‌درنگ از آن خون بیرون خواهد آمد و دوم دنیای وان کیو عیدی فور که دنیایی‌ست که در آسمان آن ماه برای خود همدمی یافته و ما دو ماه در آسمان می‌بینیم و تماشای این دوماه اتفاقات زیاد و هیجان‌انگیزی از جمله حمله‌ی «آدم‌کوچولوها» به دنیای ما را رقم خواهد زد... .پدر یا بهتر است بگویم ناپدری تنگو مسئول جمع‌آوری حق اشتراک شبکه NHK است و همین کافی‌ست تا آوردن نام تنگو و شبکه و ماجرای پدرش شما را به یاد داستان کوتاه «شهر گربه‌ها» بیندازم :)بله خود خودشه و موراکامی در این غول سه‌جلدی داستان شهر گربه‌ها را به زیبایی هرچه تمام‌تر بسط می‌دهد و تمام علامت‌ سوال‌های ذهنتان را از بین خواهد برد.و از آن‌طرف مادر آئومامه

53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30800-oriana,Rating 4 out of 5,"Because I am an idiot (and because it was way cheaper), I bought this massive weapon of a book in a single volume, rather than the super-portable trilogy edition. It's been staring at me reproachfully for weeks, so I finally took a big Cutco knife to it and DIY'd it into two volumes. I haven't had to do that since I read Infinite Jest, but it was totally worth it.***Checking in after finishing tonight, it seems that I spent five full weeks with this book, which is longer than I've spent with anyone other than Pynchon and DFW, I think? So that's crazy, but also somewhat lovely, as those guys and this guy are all among my most favorites ever. Also I read three graphic novels interspersed with 1Q84, the last of which was Rasl, another book that moves creepily between worlds.So let's just say I've had some strange dreams over the last week.In any case, 1Q84. As with The Instructions, this book doesn't actually feel long, despite being 1200 freaking pages. It has such an easy flow, such a compelling pace (though slightly plodding in its meticulousness), that it just slid right along. I actually sort of feel like it wasn't long enough, as there are a couple of questions that I don't think ever got properly answered. I think I said this about Against the Day, but a book like this is a little bit like reading an entire life; just sitting on someone's shoulder as they go about their every day, so naturally it feels like you just want to keep following them, day after day, forever. On to other things about this book. It's got all the Murakami building blocks that we have come to expect:[from HTMLGIANT]So that was comforting. In fact, comforting is really the main adjective I would use to describe this reading experience. Yes, I know, the book does contain murder, incest, rape, child neglect, religious fundamentalism, torture, and on and on. But yet, it's not gory, or explicit, or harsh. All these things are dealt with in the same slow, measured, matter-of-fact tone and pace as the more ""normal"" parts, and moreover, the harshness amounts to a very very small percentage of the book overall. I'm dancing around doing any plot explication, but here are some of the other things to be found in this book: ghostwriting, smoking hash, mystical ""little people,"" moon(s), cats and owls, a gun (along with a discussion of Chekhov, and whether a gun introduced into a story must eventually be fired), loneliness, despair, shadow selves, long train rides, cute nurses.So I definitely don't mean to say that it's boring—just slow. Methodical. Placid. Calm.Which I definitely don't mind! Although I suppose I have to admit that I don't think this is as good as Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, and perhaps a lot of that has to do with how much more electrifying the latter is. It might even also have to do with how much shorter Wind-Up Bird is, and that is by no means a short book. I mean, while I wouldn't say 1Q84 ever exactly dragged, I do think he could have sliced out at least 200 pages just through a bit of stern editorial oversight. I am known to be pretty fucking elitist and cranky, and for most authors, if I felt like a book could loose two hundred goddamn pages, I would probably never read that person again. But I don't know what it is about Murakami; to me reading him is like wrapping up in my favorite soft threadbare hoodie—it's just so damn comfortable, I forget to notice that there's a hole in the pocket, one of the seams is unraveling, and it's got a couple of pretty noticeable stains. I don't know if that metaphor works or what. But I did love this book, just like I've loved every other book he's written, and will probably love everything else he ever does. "

“If you can’t understand it without an explanation, you can’t understand it with an explanation.”
Spending time in 1Q84, I felt uneasy and uncertain, disoriented, “increasingly like an ant trapped in a bowl of sand.” Even now, I’m not really sure whether I “liked” it or not, which actually says quite a bit about the originality of this remarkably uncanny reading experience. The book had this dark, surreal, haunting, sort of viscous atmosphere that I sank into and got lost in. It gradually but steadily colored my thoughts and perceptions, seeping into my daily life, until even the tree outside my bedroom window began to appear ominous and strange. And although I was happy to finish it and be able to put it aside, simultaneously, on another level, I never wanted it to end. It’s harder than you might think to leave the world of 1Q84 behind.This was my first encounter with Murakami, but it seems to me that he has a genuine gift for conjuring up that intangible, elusive something, that spark. Needless to say, I’ll definitely be coming back for more."

In other words, each person was made out of the components of two people. Everyone was happy with this arrangement and never really gave it much thought. But then God took a knife and cut everyone in half, right down the middle. So after that the world was divided just into male and female, the upshot being that people spend their time running around trying to locate their missing half.”  -Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the ShoreMurakami recreates his spell with the above Greek myth which he already narrated in his book “Kafka on the Shore” but this time it’s with highly structured plot which goes beyond 900 pages.1Q84 is a story of two characters who are wandering around trying to locate their missing half in a parallel world with two Moons, haunted by little people, where there is an entrance but no exit until…….Murakami has blended his love for Greek Philosophy/mythology along with Russian literature in the subplots of this book where he narrates a society which is more or less equal to the classless society which Plato described in his “The Republic”, a primitive form of communism. The stuffs which I always love to read. A world with two moons.From the out shell 1Q84 is a love story woven with highly complex surreal episode driven by “Dotha and Maza”, beyond once comprehension. Like “IF you can’t understand it without an explanation, you can’t understand it with an explanation.”An ultimate Murakami effect is shown through the character of NHK Fee Collector who bangs on the doors (to explain the split of Dotha and Maza ).On the whole 1Q84 got everything which will make you engaged in the process of reading, only one drawback is the length.New Image Added on 19 Oct 2013 (Source : Haruki Murakami Stuff: A Murakami Fan Blog - Photo by Phina Ëndor Coöre) "

57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66796812-erigibbi,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5Devo parlarvi di 1Q84 di Haruki Murakami, e il problema è che non so nemmeno da dove partire. Non perché non abbia cose da dire a riguardo, ne avrei fin troppe probabilmente, ma perché non devo svelarvi troppo. E parlarvi di un libro come 1Q84 senza dire nulla di concreto sui contenuti lo sto trovando davvero complicato.Ci troviamo a Tokyo nel 1984. I protagonisti principali sono Aomame, assassina, che con una tecnica particolare vendica le donne che hanno subito violenza; e Tengo, insegnante di matematica per tre giorni alla settimana, nei restanti quattro è uno scrittore.Entrambi si ritroveranno in una Tokyo uguale e diversa al tempo stesso. In cielo ci sono due lune, quella che conosciamo e una più piccola, deforme e verde che si trova accanto all’altra, ma non tutti se ne accorgono. Aomame chiama quel mondo “1Q84” (la q sta per question mark, il punto interrogativo) e Tengo lo chiama “la città dei gatti”. Nomi diversi per indicare la stessa cosa.«Che mi piaccia o no, adesso mi trovo in questo anno 1Q84. Il 1984 che conoscevo non esiste più da nessuna parte. Ora è l’anno 1Q84. L’aria è cambiata, il paesaggio è cambiato. Devo adattarmi il più in fretta possibile a questo mondo con punto interrogativo. Come un animale che è stato trasportato in una nuova foresta, che per proteggersi e sopravvivere deve capire il più presto possibile le regole del luogo, e adattarvisi.»Penso di avervi detto un decimo di quello che c’è da dire su quest’opera, e forse vi ho comunque detto tanto.Non ho letto molti libri di Murakami, eppure qualcosa mi dice che 1Q84 è L’opera. È un libro mastodontico, non tanto per le pagine, che sono poco più di 1100 (e che ok, non sono poche), ma per tutti i contenuti e tutti i legami che si sviluppano nel corso delle pagine.Sono persino andata ad indagare il simbolismo giapponese. Nel romanzo assume importanza fin dall’inizio una crisalide d’aria. Si parla di crisalide quando ci riferiamo alle farfalle. In Giappone la farfalla è ritenuta il simbolo di nascente bellezza e grazia della donna. Se avete letto il libro, capite quanto senso assume questa visione? E se non lo avete letto, be’, tenetevi a mente questa cosa. Ho indagato per bene questa cosa della farfalla, perché ci sono diversi significati a seconda dei movimenti, o del colore. Per esempio, due farfalle che danzano nell’aria indicano felicità coniugale. Due farfalle bianche che si allontanano indicano le anime di due amanti suicidi. Seguire una farfalla indica la soluzione di un problema o aiuta a svelare un mistero. Tutte cose che in un modo o nell’altro sembrano legate a 1Q84 di Murakami.Ci sono così tante cose di cui vorrei parlarvi: l’esattore della NHK, una preghiera, la Sinfonietta di Janáček, la Società dei Testimoni, i Little People, 1984 di George Orwell, una persona strangolata, Fukaeri, mother e daughter, La crisalide d’aria. Sono tutti legami, persone, situazioni, cose che ritornano, che si ripetono, in una storia o nell’altra, in un mondo o nell’altro.Si legge un capitolo di Aomame e si esclama: “Oddio, è la stessa cosa che è successa in un capitolo di Tengo”. Si legge un capitolo di Tengo e si esclama: “Oddio, è la stessa cosa che è successa in un capitolo di Aomame”. Si legge un capitolo di Aomame e un capitolo di Tengo e si esclama: “Oddio, è la stessa cosa che Tengo ha riscritto nel romanzo La crisalide d’aria”.1Q84 è un trip mentale assurdo. Pensate anche solo all’idea di creare un mondo alternativo, ma parallelo, uguale al nostro mondo, che differisce solo per piccoli dettagli. Le persone che ci vivono però sono le stesse e i rapporti che noi abbiamo con quelle persone sono gli stessi che avevamo nel mondo normale. Solo le persone che si accorgono di essere in un mondo diverso, alternativo, dove in cielo ci sono due lune anziché una, sono uniti da un legame speciale, unico se vogliamo, e diventano davvero protagonisti, personaggi attivi, che modificano il corso della storia. Geniale, semplice e assurdo allo stesso tempo.«Questo non è uno spettacolo da quattro soldi. Il 1Q84 è un mondo reale, dove se ci si taglia esce sangue vero. Il dolore è sempre dolore e la paura è sempre paura. La luna sospesa in cielo non è di cartapesta. È una luna vera. Anzi, una coppia di lune vere. In questo mondo io ho accettato volentieri di sacrificare la mia vita per Tengo, e non permetterò a nessuno di dire che la mia scelta è un falso.»Pensate anche solo a due bambini che non si sono praticamente mai parlati, ma che si sono stretti la mano. Quella stretta di mano, quel ricordo è l’unica cosa vera e di sostanza che rimarrà ai due, anche una volta diventati adulti, anche dopo vent’anni. Quel tenersi per mano ha cambiato e cambierà le loro vite, per sempre.E il bello è che in più di 1000 pagine di libro Murakami non spiega nemmeno tutto. Alla fine ci resteranno dei dubbi e delle domande. La cosa sorprendente è che questo non sapere mi infastidisce, e allo stesso tempo mi va bene. Le cose che noi lettori non sappiamo, sono le stesse cose che Tengo e Aomame non sanno e che non riusciranno probabilmente mai a sapere. E se non le sanno loro, perché dobbiamo pretendere di saperle noi? E aggiungiamoci che stiamo parlando di Murakami. Come dicevo all’inizio, non ho (per il momento) letto molti libri suoi, ma quei pochi che ho letto hanno un finale aperto o perlomeno qualcosa di lasciato in sospeso quindi non mi stupisce se 1Q84 mi ha lasciato con dubbi e incertezze. E forse va bene così.1Q84 non è un romanzo facile. Ci sono anche dei punti piuttosto lenti (e questo è l’unico motivo per cui non do il massimo dei voti a quest’opera). Ma è un romanzo assurdo, e nella sua assurdità è un romanzo che al momento mi sento di definire unico nel suo genere, almeno per quella che è la mia esperienza da lettrice. È un viaggio, un viaggio all’insegna dell’onirico, un viaggio dove un poco alla volta, pagina dopo pagina, si scoprono cose, legami, associazioni. Un trip mentale che farete senza il bisogno di assumere sostanze deleterie, vi basterà leggere una riga dopo l’altra.Le parole pronunciate. Le sensazioni che non diventano parole. Le promesse dimenticate. Le speranze non realizzate. Le aspirazioni andate smarrite."
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2908629-ellie,Rating 5 out of 5,"1Q84 by Haruki Murakami is wonderful, familiar Murakami-land... taken to new levels. The story, the characters, the themes, everything both separately and taken together is incredibly satisfying. There are cults, children, and a permeable boundary between ""reality"" and the supernatural. There is everything Murakami fans expect and want from their Murakami-plus. The love story is touching, the characters more than usually well-drawn, and the plot/s interesting. It drags a bit occasionally in the mid-points but on the whole, considering how huge the book is, it reads quickly.I'm not impartial, though: I love Murakami generally and this one in particular."

My star rating (which, for me, is not a bad rating) is a reflection mostly of my own personal state of mind at the time of reading. I read a lot during the first few months of the pandemic, but I wasn't fully present in most of my reading. 1Q84 needs some solid absorption to fully appreciate it and I just couldn't completely zone in.It's a big, odd, twisty story and it hooked me, but I kept wriggling free. I've got great swathes highlighted in my electronic copy, but no corresponding notes. I'm certain that any review I attempted out of that would be unfair and incomplete. I will say that some of the strangeness and atmosphere has stuck with me in a really cool way, but also that I remember griping about certain aspects of it to a bookish friend while I was reading.This is a definite candidate for a reread, though I think I might rather encourage myself to try another title by this widely appreciated author instead, or first. I'd be open to suggestions on which to try next!"
60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29383287-kate,Rating 5 out of 5," 5/5stars | Favorite Standalones  Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay1DH...  edit May 18, 2017 Okay, I've sat on this book for the night and all of today and I think I'm ready to write a little bit more about it. So, let's see how long this review gets.Okay, so, if ya'll don't know, this novel is a ""dystopian"" following two characters named Tengo and Aomame. I put dystopian in quotes because I legit don't know why people try to call this a dystopian??????????? Idk about ya'll but the dystopians I read take place in the future (not the past like this one which is set in 1984) and they usually have to do with overthrowing the government... not a world with two moons and Little People crawling out of dead goats and people. but that's just me. Anyways... We follow the character Tengo who gets caught up in a crazy scheme of rewriting a young girl's book which takes off as a best seller; and we follow Aomame who kills people who domestically abuse/sexually abuse women. Very different characters. Very different stories. But, per Murakami, their stories inevitably twine together.This story gets CRAZY. The first part of this book, in my opinion, is quite slow because of how much world building and character development has to happen. The beginning is pretty normal, not gonna lie, but after the first 300 pages or so, shit gets WEIRD. Did you think I was kidding when I mentioned Little People crawling out of dead goats and people? No, that actually happens - a couple times. This is arguably the weirdest of Murakami's books (which makes me curious as to why it's one of his most popular, since usually his ""normal,"" contemporary novels are usually the ones people love so much) that I've read, but definitely one of the most gripping, CRAZY novels. It's definitely one of my top faves of his to date.So, some pros:SUPERB writing, as Murakami always doesAMAZING character developmenta CRAZY world that is so fucking fleshed out I feel like I too could go down an emergency staircase and pop out into 1Q84/the cat townFuka-Eri is a precious, small child and I just want to hold herThis book legit makes 0% sense but Murakami somehow twists everything to make you think it makes total sense.Murakami literally made a world inside a world inside a world like wtf how did h e d o t h a tSEX POSITIVITY YEAHAlso, asexual character??????????? (in my interpretation at least)Consnonejk jk jk, there were a fewMostly just the fact that I have SO MANY QUESTIONS I NEED ANSWERS TO: What happened to Fuka-Eri?????????? my precious child better be okay we never find out what happened to her after she went back to the professorWhy did Ushikawa have to die though like dude chill he was cooperating that wasn't cool at allhoW WAS AOMAME AND FUKA-ERI CONNECTED?????WAS FUKA-ERI SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT AOMAME AS A CHILD HOW TENGO REMEMBERED HER AND FELL IN LOVE WITH HER?WERE THEY CONNECTED CAUSE THEY WERE BOTH MAZAS/DOHTASWAS FUKA-ERI A DOHTA (cause I think she was)WAS AOMAME A DOHTA (cause if Fuka-Eri was then Aomame was also)also what was the point of Tengo like I don't wanna be like he was useless but the actual main plot of this book (besides aomame thinking she NEEDS to find him) he doesn't actually play a part..? besides rewriting Air Chrysalis which sets things in motion but HE wasn't actually a huge part.whAT IS THE BABY. IS IT A DOHTA? IS IT ACTUALLY TENGOS? LIKE WTF. But, overall this book was a fucking Masterpiece. It's been a long time since I've loved a book this much. I have a feeling this one is going to stay with me for a long, LONG time. Trigger Warnings Rape/Discussion of Rape/Sexual AssaultDomestic Abuse/Discussion of Domestic AbuseMurderChild AbuseCults/Depiction of Religion as a cultGuns/Gun UseAttempted Suicide/Discussion of Suicide((And here are my reactions to each Part as I read them)) Part 1 This first book was WONDERFUL. I deducted a .5 point simply because it was a LITTLE draggy and not too much happened - but the world building, character development and plot set up was SUPERB. In this volume we are introduced to our two main characters/main story lines. First there is the woman Aomame who is a professional assassin who is able to kill people by driving a needle into a certain place on their neck - a place that, for whatever reason, she is able to detect on people while most others don't even know it exists. Then there is Tengo; a struggling author who gets roped into a crazy scheme of rewriting a young girl's story to be turned into a big-shot novel. At the beginning of this story, Aomame is stuck in traffic while on her way to an important meeting, when her taxi driver tells her of a secret passage down a phone booth that will take her to a street where she can catch a bus or subway. The taxi driver leaves her with a message; ""After you DO something like that, the everyday LOOK of things might seem to change a little. Things may look DIFFERENT to you than they did before. But don't let appearances fool you. There's always only one reality."" and thus, Aomame is thrust into a world with two moons, sequences of events she never remembers happening, the existence of 'little people' and dozens of other characters who all affect her life. Now, I can't tell you which story I liked better. I'm quite wishy washy on Aomame's chapters - sometimes I FUCKING LOVED THEM and sometimes I really REALLY disliked her. Aomame is an extremely strong, badass lady - but... also doesn't consider herself a feminist and also kind of bad mouths feminists and thinks the only way girls can fight against men is by kicking them in the balls. But then all the sex positive stuff is great and just her overarching plot line is REALLY interesting, but I'm still not 100% sure about her as a character. I also RAELLY love Fuka-Eri. Tengo's storyline isn't as interesting, except for the parts about Fuka-Eri and her past and all the crazy, surreal, magical-realism stuff that has happened to her. I'm also just SO CURIOUS as to how the timelines are going to connect because atm we KINDA know the connection between Tengo and Aomame and a few little events, but so far I'm still not totally sure how it's going to come together.overall, really loved the beginning of this story!! Part 2 Holy shit.This section of 1Q84 obviously took me AGES to get to (mostly because I basically DNFed it for about 3 months while I was at school), but once I finally just sat down and read it, I sped through this third of the book in just 2 sittings because THINGS GET SO GOOD.While the first part of this book spends a lot of time explaining the characters, the world, and getting everything in motion, this part has SO MANY answers, so much progression, and so many climatic points that idk where Murakami could take this in the next part! This is definitely the most complex, thrilling book of his I've read because I can never seem to guess what's going to happen!The rest of the review will be hidden due to spoilers Okay, so, firstly, I genuinely can't decide which part I liked better - like, seriously, this book goes back and forth on which part is my favorite to read. In part 1 it was probably Tengo, but Aomame's chapters in this part were SO FLIPPING INTERESTING.I'm super happy we got to see the entirety of Aomame's encounter with Leader, because I had a fear Murakami would just give us a taste or stretch it out into the third section, but nope, we got all of it! The amount of answers that came out of that section, like the two moons, the introduction of 'dohta' and all of that - AH, wonderful, I'm so happy that we're already getting answers rather than Murakami waiting till the end to explain all of this!Tengo's parts were also very interesting. I'm still confused about what the whole grant thing was about, and I hope we get a more obvious explanation for it cause that's a little confusing. plus hOLY SHIT IS FUKA-ERI A DOHTA?? I genuinely had a moment of asDHKFJOAIUWI WHAT?! I NEED to know this info ASAP please.Also, I'm slightly worried this is going to be just a love story with how it ended. Cause Aomame def didn't actually kill herself, and I have a fear that Tengo and her are gonna have a happily ever after at the end and I'm gonna be wicked mad if that's the case ngl. Part 3 This was a MASTERPIECE.How it wrapped up.Just.Wow.I have no words."
61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57003346-matthew-ted,Rating 2 out of 5,"56th book of 2021. Artist for this review is Japanese artist Aya Takano. Not my kind of art at all but it seemed fitting for the novel, for some reason. 2.5. In an old review of a Goethe novel I partially responded to an article I’d read around that time about “growing out” of books we read as teenagers/young adults. To save repeating myself too much, that review is here. The usual names appeared, Kerouac, namely, Hesse, Murakami. Now, I’ve read every Murakami novel up to his publication of 1Q84, including the first two novels Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, which I see around less than the others. I generally consider myself quite a big Murakami “fan”, though I wouldn’t put him up with my favourite writers. I read After Dark and didn’t like it a while back and presumed that maybe my Murakami-phase had come to an end. On the other hand, maybe I just didn’t like that novel? I left it a while (we know how similar Murakami’s novels are) before diving into the giant 1300-page-ish novel we have here. ""Draped in Eternal Cloud""Turns out maybe I am over my phase. Murakami for me will always remind me of being at university and for that, I will never say I dislike his body of work as a whole, even if I sour towards his works now. That was my original counter to the article I read, that turning our backs on the books we once adored is the same as denying what helped to shape us. I remember reading some of those slim Murakami novels cover-to-cover on the giant beanbag we had in our student living room, drinking rum, feeling, essentially, like a Murakami character. (That beanbag was a great reading spot for me over the years in the house and it came to be wildly helpful too. Guests slept on it, even, when staying the night. My housemates and I had made a pact that we would never have sex on the beanbag as it was used as chair and as bed and as all sorts but in the end, by our final year, we all admitted to having broken the pact countless times.) Murakami reminds me of these years and his prose is comfortable, familiar, I’d even say, comforting.I had many problems with 1Q84 though that really made me questions some of the sentiments I’ve laid out here. The first two Books were decent enough. I’ve read enough Murakami to know bits sometimes go on too long, that sometimes the characters don’t “do anything” for pages and pages and that’s fine. He puts his work in other places. The world of 1Q84 didn’t appeal to me much. Really, the main feature of this world is the fact it has two moons. That’s about it, really. The ominous and mysterious “Little People” meant nothing to me and their random “ho-ho”ing just irritated me. An assassin for a character sounded interesting but ultimately it wasn’t really. Tengo being a writer charmed me for a time, getting some (we can presume) of Murakami’s ideas and thoughts on writing coming through the narrative but it all sort of burnt off too in the end. There’s also an awful lot of breasts-talk in this novel (almost every introduced woman is described by her breasts predominantly) (this isn’t too new for Murakami fans) and an awful lot of sexual child abuse rape/not rape—explained as part of the “magical-realism” of the plot. ""Moon""The main problem with the novel is the final Book, Book 3, which counts for the last 400/500 pages of the novel. It was bad. It was Murakami to the extreme, but gone too far: it was 450-odd pages of characters watching each other, characters going shopping, watching other characters going shopping, characters cooking, characters thinking about other characters, characters attempting to find out about other characters, etc. The main issue was the repetitiveness of it; coincidentally, I am also reading Calvino’s If On a Winter’s Night a Traveller for the second time at the moment too and it felt mockingly prophetic. At times I was genuinely stunned by what I was reading in 1Q84, that surely there was something wrong with my edition and that Murakami wasn’t seriously telling the reader, for the third time, the same piece of information. Ushikawa is introduced as a third perspective character in Book 3. I won’t say why but he is essentially attempting to uncover facts and connections between the other two main characters that we already know very well as readers. Ushikawa’s chapters were almost entirely comprised of him uncovering things we already knew ourselves as readers. I had to sit through pages and pages of him fumbling around trying to put two dots together, two dots which I already knew from 300 pages ago. It felt like a complete waste of time. Book 3 just felt like 400 pages of overblown baggy space that should have been cut. I don’t mind rambling, in fact, I loved Murakami’s other big baggy novels, but this was too far for me. So though I thought the first two Books were fine and the novel was on for a solid 3-star rating, the boredom, incredulous repetitions of Book 3 butchered the whole experience for me. Naturally not everything is answered. There is a fairly “satisfying” but ultimately predictable ending thrown at us; and thanks to the numbing-effect of Book 3, an ending that carried no real emotion or significance. They call this sort of thing a “literary-let-down”. Over 1000 pages for not really much worth, in my opinion. I’m glad I finally read it. In the challenge I set myself back in university I have two more books to read of Murakami’s novel oeuvre before I’ve finished the lot. Frankly, I’m not sure I’ll bother. Perhaps it is better to leave his earlier novels in my mind as they were at the time on that (soiled) beanbag drinking rum and feeling content. Murakami, your memory is safe with me, but I think I’m finished with you in the present. (I’m certain I will be incredibly saddened and shocked when you finally pass.)"

I found myself saying again and again, ""this is so damn LONG!"" It would work better as 3 short novels, as was the original intention of the author. I also think using two different translators was a mistake. As for the content of the novel itself I didn't feel any sense of urgency to finish this book. That's not to say that I was disinterested or that I wasn't enjoying it. I just wasn't in a hurry to find out what happened next.

I’m here to collect your NHK fee. If you receive the signal, then you have to pay the fee. You’re a sophisticated sort of person, Mr. Murkami, so I’m sure you understand that. Not paying the fee is the same as stealing. You wouldn’t want your readers to know that you are a thief, would you? In your novels, several of your characters receive the signal but don’t pay the fee. This is also stealing. Even literary characters need to pay the fee. You’ve created quite a few characters over your many novels and none of them have been paying their fees all these years. That’s quite a bit of stealing you’ve been doing.Knock. Knock. Knock. It’s me, Daniel. Mr. Murakami, did you think you could get rid of me? I read your book in the summer of 2021. There was the Corona pandemic, so there was a curfew. I often went to the Tsutaya Book Store on the 5th floor of Nagasaki Coco Walk and read there. But only until 8 p.m. Next to me was a man, Ushikawa. I believe you know him. Perhaps it is a sign of my fantasy, or perhaps it is a testament to your lively prose, that a character from your novel slipped out of your pages, manifested himself, stalked me to the Tsutaya bookstore, and then asked me if I could find Aomame in the pages of your book. He asked me if I’d seen the two moons. I informed him that we live in normal times and that if there were any less than three, we would be in trouble.Knock. Knock. Knock. It’s me again. Did you think you could get rid of me so easily? You know that the NHK are a persistent bunch, Mr. Murakami. You’ve written perhaps more than a dozen books. So many characters. The NHK is licking itself in anticipation of the fees these many characters will pay. The NHK is not a monster, Mr. Murakami! How dare you even think that! And yet, it has a tongue, not unlike a cow tongue awash in a river…it licks itself in anticipation. I will ask you to do the math, Mr. Murakami. Do you think we NHK employees have so much time that we can multiply all the fees that are due over so many characters under the charge of one person? You do not have to answer now. Just know that I will be back tomorrow with your answer. You will hear the same knock as today. I wonder, until you pay your NHK fees will you ever be comfortable hearing a knock on your door.Knock. Knock. Knock. Mr. Murakami, it’s me, Daniel. I am still at the bookstore. Tsutaya is such a pleasant place to be on a rainy day. Your book ended up being the perfect way to spend a rainy day. As for your character, Mr. Ushikawa, he is not the most unpleasant guest on a day like this. The deep pains of his private life mirror my own. I ask him if the weight of a life can be measured in novel pages. From the window of Tsutaya bookstore, there are now four moons. That’s odd! But, oh well, it’s no use shaking your fist at the world and screaming for it to make sense. I know that the NHK populates one of those moons. They have a base there from which they dispatch their many agents. The characters from your book populate another. It’s possible that the grey one is made out of cheese. I say to Mr. Ushikawa, “I know Mr. Murakami hired you to follow me. Tell him that on the third moon, I’m collecting his NHK fees. All 1,239 of them. On the second moon, I’m a hired killer for Tamaru, and on the first, I’m writing a standard book in dry, clear prose. Something that will wow the underwhelming talent that staffs the bureaucracies of the publishing companies.Ushikawa is smiling at me, a big dumb smile.

65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5594816-lyndz,Rating 2 out of 5,"What can I say about 1q84? In all honesty; I mostly hated it. Far-be-it am I from a Japanese Fiction connoisseur. I know I am probably going to get some backlash from a certain demographic for this comment; but, has anyone else noticed a reoccurring theme in J-Fiction of completely unnecessary and asinine sex scenes? Am I the only one who thinks it is rather juvenile and misogynistic to repetitively describe a woman’s breasts every single time that she reenters the plot?I had to ask myself how and why I made it through a nearly 1000 page novel that I have little-to-nothing good to say about. And the answer is, because I kept expecting something amazing to happen. You know when you go out to a restaurant for the first time that all your friends have raved about? You order your food and sit there anxiously waiting for the waiter to bring out a tray with all your goodies on it. Every time you see your waiter come out from the back carrying a tray you look around and think to yourself, “oh here it is, here it comes, finally I can see what everyone has been talking about”. Then he promptly marches over to a different table and you are left sitting there sipping your water and feeling ripped off. That is the same expectant feeling I had throughout the whole book, like at any moment Haruki Murakami is going to deliver. But he never did.Imagine now that a long 1000 pages later, all the lights are shut off in the restaurant and you are still sitting there in the dark waiting for a long-gone waiter thinking, “hey, where is my food!?” - That describes my attitude towards 1q84. 
I want my food damn it.
By that same token, I have to hand it to Murakami, he did in fact trick me in to reading the whole book because he kept me just interested enough to keep returning to it. I believe the reason so many people think that they like 1q84 is not because of the inherent merits of the book, but because of the commitment it takes to read it all the way through. I mean, think about it, who runs a marathon and then afterward says “that sucked! Do not ever do it, I was so beat up and sick afterward, it was not worth it at all!” No one says that, because if you commit to running a marathon you have so much of yourself physically and emotionally invested in it that you have this unspoken obligation to at least pretend that you enjoyed it, whether it is the truth or not. 1q84 was a test of endurance, and I mean that in the best possible way. I must be a sick and twisted individual to be willing to admit that I stuck with a 1000 pager that I did not like. PlotI had a problem with Ushikawa’s deductive line of reasoning when it came to figuring out the connection between Tengo & Aomame. It was way too farfetched to be believable. It felt too much like that “yada yada” Seinfeld episode to me. You can’t just “yada yada” over pertinent facts to the story line! Aomame supposedly killed someone “yada yada” I am going to stake out the house of someone who I think might have been in the same elementary school as her but I know she has had no contact with in 20+ years. So I walked into a coffee shop this morning, yada yada, and now I am engaged! I am unable to connect A to C because I am obviously missing some vital information, or logical string of events, or B.ProseWhen I read books that were originally written in another language I try to give them the benefit of the doubt, with the assumption that at least some of the prose was lost in the translation. That is why I have withheld my usual comments/critiques on the prose. CharactersThis is where 1q84 earns it’s 2nd star. The characters are complex, individual, and definitely not 2 dimensional. Tengo in particular was very likeable. Every single one of the characters had their own personality and style – and believe me, Murakami does not hesitate to introduce a ton of sub-characters. TLDR: If you enjoy mind numbingly repetitive dialogs and monologues, preposterous sex scenes, boredom, and the general feeling of anticipation (but not the usual accompanying “fulfillment”) then you should not hesitate one minute longer, put on your marathon tennies and run your masochistic little self to your local bookstore and pick up your copy of 1q84, better yet, run to my house and you can have mine. 2 stars “it was ok”"

The way his mind works is fascinating.He talks about how writing a novel is like participating in a marathon. It takes effort and discipline to go from page one to the end. In addition, the break throughs that he makes in his writing he attributes, in part, to the flow state he experiences during his physical exertions.This creates a detail-filled and highly introspective world in his novels that some readers can't get enough of.But that approach didn't appeal to me in this book.The story develops slowly, so so slowly. We are in the characters' minds for nearly every thought. We learn their eating and drinking habits, sleeping problems, past history, sexual preferences ad infinitum.The magical realism portions of the story, my favorite parts by the way, were fleeting and infuriatingly uninformative. This is another draw, or so I have gathered, for some readers who like having major unanswered plot points by the end of the story.This could lead to some interesting book club meetings, but I'm not one of those readers. If you're going to tell a story, for heaven's sake, tell the story.On one hand, the introspective nature of the storytelling gives deep insight into the characters. By the time you're through, you feel like you could write what Tengo and Aomame are going to do next. It is introversion to the extreme. On the other hand, it crushed my interest in caring what was going to happen next.Why? Personal preference, I suppose.Legions of readers love this book. I'm curious as to why, but it might be as simple as how readers like to experience and absorb stories.Final note: Trigger warnings for domestic violence and sexual abuse."

Aomeme has fallen into a sort of parallel universe in the year 1984, which once she realizes this, dubs it 1Q84 (Q for question mark). Her true love, Tengo, is alive in this world she has fallen into, courtesy of a suggestion by a cab driver who encourages her to take an emergency exit ladder off the freeway. This ""rabbit hole"" leads her through this altered universe to ultimately find her true love, Tengo, who she has loved since grade school. Meanwhile, Tengo is alive in ""1Q84"" and has been searching for Aomeme, his one true love. Their lives eventually converge but not without danger along the way. I felt this was ultimately a love story, weaving its way in a labyrinth of strange and vile characters that only add to the dreamlike, and sometimes nightmarish nature of the story. "

71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6132231-owlseyes,Rating 4 out of 5,"Why a planet Earth with two moons? 

 It’s not the first time I encounter, quite recently, that scenario*. The British conspiracy theorist David Icke lectured on our planet having once a different moon…gone; this one we see, almost daily, being a planetoid. Also recently, I was reading Whitley Strieber (2012-the war for souls): in his book there’s also this two-moons scenario.Why?Are humans unsatisfied with one moon only? Should the ebb and flow of sea waves change…and other phenomena as well?. What if, in fact, two moons were the usual sky landscape? What changes in humans would occur? Especially in their psychology? I would add to the speculation this book: What If the Earth Had Two Moons?: And Nine Other Thought-Provoking Speculations on the Solar Systemby Neil F. Comins.

Murakami’s book is a book about questioning (Q). It has two great characters; I would call them the two pillars: they share a part of their childhood, the reader will conclude, but they never meet later in life. They are Aomame and Tengo. They have also in common this personal/private vision of an earth with two moons, with different colors each. There’s some “disconnect” in them, compared to other ordinary human beings. Two worlds in their lives. Almost, two personalities in each of them. I am not sure in what world I am,…or year; -we’re in 1984, Tokyo, Japan.  But there’s no great similitude with Orwell’s novel: ”whoever controls the past controls the future”; “whoever controls the present controls the past”.   The movie/book is a Stalinist parable: with a big Brother. In Murakami’s we read:”today there’s no place for Big Brother”; instead: the little people  took over. Yet: there’s “a consistently, invisible, indefinable presence: undermining us"". 1Q84. I need to give you some characterization of the main characters of the book; you’ll connect the dots…of meaning. “She [Aomame] was convinced she was no more living in year 1984, but in the transformed year 1Q84”. She had been a Jehovah’s witness while a child. But she left the association. Aomame, a physical education teacher and karate and acupuncture expert, had cut ties with her family. Now, on her own,she gets killing assignments, from an old widow. She kills men. She had to do research like on the 1981 shootings involving the police versus the Vanguard sect. The case Tsubasa would, soon, get into her hands. Tengo is a math teacher. Tengo had persistent flashes from two years old; images about his mother and someone else. He wonders if these memories are real or produced. He’s got doubts about the “father” who raised him. The collector of TV taxes, who forced him to go with him on Sundays: from house to house, collecting. The one who messed up with his childhood. Tengo had been fixing the book from a late-teen girl: Fuka. The content is good, but the writing needs fixing. He gets to know of her past…and sects like Sakigake (Vanguard) ; the sect has a guru with special powers; and the guru has raped a girl called Tsubasa. From her mouth got out the little people, while she sleeps. Tengo would think: ""I don’t want to attract a JINX on my writing”. The Fuka/Tengo book would later become a best seller; but Fuka would disappear.... At his apartment Tengo reads Chekhov to Fuka: the story of the Russian writer living in Sacalina isle for a while. There, Chekhov, a medical doctor, describes the life of the Guliaks (a near extinction people). The Guliaks apparently don’t use logical thinking but meditation and dream. They never wash; have no family authority; no notions on superior or inferior, or justice. Tengo wonders on why the Russian author made such an absurd thing; it was a peregrination to wash his soul of impurities. He wanted to visit the sick spot of his nation. Tengo reflects on his own brain: time may twist/bend…he wants to rewrite the past. What we call present is the result of one accumulation of the past. “I would like to rewrite the present…but if you would rewrite the past, present would change too”. And Fuka asks Tengo about 1984, the novel. He explains: it’s about totalitarianism: people are controlled by a Big Brother. It’s about History being constantly rewritten; employees who work to correct words. 

 Fuka had been raised by sensei Ayumi. He reads Mc Luhan:”the means is the language”; he was ahead of his time. Sensei had a great force and deep wisdom. BUT THE LITTLE PEOPLE HAVE GOT A DEEP WISDOM AND FORCE AS BIG AS HIS. Tengo muses: “I’m in world which is not this one in the other world there are two moons”. Bizarre things would happen if this world would have two moons. Someone in the novel had a degree in literature (about Dickens); there, she learned the difference between lunatic and insane; a lunatic is a captive of the moon; if he/she commits a crime than he/she’s not responsible. In Dickens time they acknowledged the moon got people insane**. Two moons would make things worse. 

 Aomame is just a lunatic ...right? And Tengo, an Orwellian rewriter? ---*http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbZ4Ml...** ""The tales of the full moon and insanity, madness and heightened bleeding are quite true.You know that television influences you to a great degree.The moon is the same way"".

73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811928-forrest,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am a slow reader. Despite a battery of classes on speed reading and comprehension starting in 4th grade, when I was told I was a “gifted” reader, I still consider myself a slow reader. It might be the company I keep – I like to be around really smart people when I can – that makes me feel like a slow reader, in comparison. In any case, I do think I’m a slow reader.It’s largely for this reason that I tend to avoid big doorstop novels. More often than not, they start out quickly, then slow to a crawl in very short order. And when I’m looking at over 1000 pages of text, the last thing I need is an uninteresting crawl. I don’t feel that way with Murakami, for the most part, and especially with this novel, 1Q84. Murakami keeps things going here. Yes, there are slow spots, but if you’ve read or written (or both) enough, you’ll notice and appreciate that these spots are intentionally chosen to be slow. There are no real accidents in Murakami’s writing. Not in this novel, at least. But there were plenty of places where he took chances. Rather than giving a blow-by-blow of the novel (Aloha has done a magnificent job of reviewing the novel itself), I’d like to go where Murakami gambled and won. So, plug in some new retro synthwave music and read on!Right from the get-go, Tengo, one of the story’s main protagonists, engages in a conversation with an editor, Komatsu, about writing. It’s interesting, to say the least, to read a writer writing about writing in his writing. And it works. Here, the reader gains some great insight into the act of writing, the strategic moves that one makes to make one’s writing great. Murakami does this in a non-pedantic, purely natural way. This is intentional: it is a setup for later metafictional moments throughout the novel. But it doesn’t feel intentional when the reader is in the midst of reading it. What a tangled web of reader, writer, and character Murakami has created here!Komatsu later hatches a downright Dickensian scheme in which Tengo hollows out, plagiarizes, and rewrites the enigmatic Fuka-Eri’s novel. Here, Murakami sets the trap, as it were, for his characters and, it seems, for the reader. It’s an outstanding plot hook about a novel within the novel. You can probably see how things could go horribly wrong here for Murakami: If he overstates the scheme, the reader feels manipulated. If he understates it, the hook is ineffective. He pulls it off with panache.One of the main “characters” are the Little People, which I won’t go into the trouble of explaining (nor do I want to spoil this for you). I thought of Arthur Machen’s The White People when I first read about them and, yes, Murakami is definitely giving a bit of an homage to Machen with them. But they are decidedly more intrusive and belligerent than Machen’s fair folk. Here, Murakami ran the danger of mimesis (or downright plagiarism), but he makes these Little People his own. I shall never read the words “Ho, ho!” again without a shudder. They give this novel a decidedly dark twist, darker than most of the Murakami I’ve read. Or, at least, the darkness is sustained for longer than it is in other works I’ve read by him. There are moments where this reads like an outright horror novel, and I’m not complaining about that a bit!One thing that horrifies me almost beyond belief is a long info-dump. I have seen many an infodump soil an otherwise beautiful novel. I had to suppose that in a novel of this length, an infodump (or several) is unavoidable. Lo and behold, on page 203 (in the paperback), an infodump rears its ugly block-text, no break, no quote, too many worded head. I admit to flipping ahead and previewing just how much torture I was about to have to endure. Ten pages! That could be a deal-breaker for me. Soon, though, I found myself entranced. Maybe it was the subject matter of the dump: the relationship and eventual suicide of the closest friend to Aomame (the other main protagonist, with Tengo). Or, perhaps it was the timing, one-fifth-ish of the way through the novel. I can definitely say that the writing was interesting, engaging, and, eventually, enthralling. Murakami pulled off one of the best infodumps I’ve read in the context of a novel. Kudos on this one. Gamble, win. Again. One of the largest chances Murakami has taken with this novel is that of rushing headlong at the fourth wall. At first, he does so through writing about writing (see above), then he tackles the topic of the exploration of literature using a wonderful metaphor of exploring a deep magical forest, right at the same time that the readers are exploring this mental space themselves. Later, he becomes even more bold, with Komatsu stating “This is the magnificent world of a picaresque novel” when talking with Tengo about their current predicament. Of course, this is true on the level of their world and on the level of the reader, layers upon layers.The metafictional nature of the novel doesn’t stop there. There is one element so important that I can’t give it away, that reveals to the characters that they might just be dealing with a reality within a reality. I can’t get more specific than that, but suffice it to say that while the characters do realize that, perhaps, they are “baked in” to an outside story, they still have their agency within it and can affect the outcome. They are not at the mercy of the author, or at least they think they are not. Murakami does an amazing sleight-of-hand in making the reader believe that the characters can make choices that affect the outcome of the novel . . . after having written the novel – the ultimate willing suspension of disbelief!The final place where Murakami gambles is in his expectation of readers’ expectations, particularly when it involves character motivation and the prospect of deception. There were at least two major characters that I felt were being deceptive. I was convinced that their deceit would turn the plot in a different direction by betraying the main protagonists, Aomame and Tengo. I was wrong. Dead wrong. Both of these minor characters were exactly what they said they were. Against all readerly expectations of an “unexpected” (though frequently expected, in actuality) plot-twist, Murakami plays his cards straight out, face up on the table. And it completely threw me! I was more surprised when I figured out that these characters, both of whom were in a position to provide plenty of surprises and subterfuge, were telling the truth all along and acting true to themselves. Murakami didn’t need a poker face – he had a royal flush in his hand the whole time and made it obvious to everyone, so obvious that the reader couldn’t help but interpose his own thoughts of deception and intrigue on two of the most straightforward people in the novel.This is not to say that Murakami reveals all. Far from it. There are several mysteries that remain unsolved and plot points unresolved. I am perfectly fine with this. I actually prefer to have vagaries in my fiction (both while reading and writing). I don’t want to know everything. I want the mysteries to linger long after I’ve closed the book, and there are some here that do. Was Kumi Adache Tengo’s reincarnated mother? Maybe, maybe not. And what of the NHK fee collector who harasses people from the hallway throughout the novel – was this or was this not the ghost of Tengo’s comatose father? I don’t know. I like to think so, but there’s nothing explicitly demanding it be so. I appreciate that Murakami has left room here for readers to fill in the blanks or to leave them unfilled, as they see fit. Not only do his characters have (the illusion of?) agency, but he imparts it to the reader, as well. If you’re looking for a novel to tell you every fine detail, to force-feed your conclusions, you are in the wrong place.Not only is it a work of technical genius, there is a great deal of emotion here, as well. At least there was for me. The timing of my reading was . . . strange and not, I believe, coincidental.Last year, about this time, my mother had recently died (in February) and my father was, I would later learn, dying. I had to make the sole decision, in both cases, to take my mother, then my father, off of life support. Mom passed quickly: ten minutes after we took her off the trio of vasopressors that were thrashing her heart into (barely - 54/16 blood pressure) functioning, she passed away. Dad lingered for much longer. Two full weeks I spent with him. Every day and many nights I spent by Dad’s bedside as he slowly died. He couldn’t speak much due to a tracheostomy (which he had had since November previous), but he could talk a little. Very little. I spent a great deal of time thanking Dad for the good things he had done for me as a son, for my Mom, and for my family. He had rough spots, as any parent has, some of them very rough, but I know that Dad loved me, and I told him I knew that. In 1Q84, Tengo spends a great deal of the novel by his comatose father’s bedside. There were similarities between my relationship with my dad and Tengo’s relationship with his father – both older men were rough characters that showed little in the way of emotion. My father was a soldier. I was born and raised in the military. Sometimes Dad could be a very strict disciplinarian, as my conduct could reflect badly on him (and often did – whenever I was arrested as a teenager, which happened a few times, my Dad heard about it from his commanding officers). Dad himself did not show much emotion, though I know he felt, sometimes deeply. The first time I ever saw my Dad cry was when I had to leave home at age eighteen because I was being banished from the Air Force base that we lived on. Yes, literally, legally banished – but that’s a different story. After my teenage years, Dad and I became reconciled and developed a great deal of love and respect for one another. We truly learned to love each other, deeply. Letting him go was one of the hardest experiences of my life. So, that wound was still pretty fresh when, less than a year later, I read 1Q84. Now, the parallels between my experience and the fictional Tengo’s break down on closer examination. But the point here is that Murakami brought up some of the deepest feelings I’ve ever experienced reading a novel. I recall reading on my lunch break at work and having to put the book away to wipe away tears. Thankfully no one else was in the office at that moment. I was a bit of a mess. But it was cathartic, and needed.After all the heartbreak and terror, 1Q84 is, after all, a love story. A touching love story. As I read, I often thought of a song that I used to listen to when I was in a contemplative mood as a teenager, contemplating about love, the Simple Minds' song “Someone, Somewhere, in Summertime”. I would be shocked if Murakami hadn’t listened to this song while writing this, as it perfectly captures both the mood and, in some ways, the actual plot, of the love story portion of 1Q84. Oh, and did I mention that I was 15 years old in 1984 and deeply in love for a good portion of that year? That might have something to do with my feelings about the love story, as well.Connections abound. The heart is a lonely place, sometimes, but it’s well worth the effort to keep reaching, whether it be for a family member, a romantic interest, or a desired aspect of life. Life is fleeting, and love is fragile, but powerful. Keep reaching and you’ll find the connections you need, if you look long and carefully enough. Keep reaching. Don’t stop!"
74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24781351-chiara,Rating 4 out of 5,"1Q84 è una delle opere più strane che mi siano capitate sotto mano in assoluto, ed è tutto dire. L'atmosfera di surrealismo che caratterizza la trilogia rende la lettura un'esperienza alquanto soggettiva e suggestiva, facendo precipitare il lettore in un mondo degno di Wonderland: due lune, i Little People e crisalidi d'aria... giusto per dare un'idea iniziale.Dei tre libri, il primo è secondo me il migliore; pur essendomi piaciuta molto la trilogia nella sua interezza, devo dire che i libri 2 e 3 non riescono a mantenere lo stesso ritmo incalzante e la stessa atmosfera da sogno del primo, un po' perché a mio avviso alcune spiegazioni sono fin troppo evasive e confusionarie - quando non assenti del tutto - e un po' perché gli eventi prendono pieghe che mi lasciano alquanto perplessa. Il fatto che non ci siano spiegazioni logiche a nemmeno la metà di quanto introdotto fa parte del fascino di Murakami, ed è un lato dei suoi romanzi che ho sempre apprezzato, ma forse in questo caso il maestro ha esagerato... o forse sono io che ho troppo ""i piedi per terra"" e dovrei lasciarmi più andare con la fantasia. Ad ogni modo, per chi ama i finali aperti, quelli opinabili, quelli interpretabili, gli schemi incomprensibili, il paranormale, la magia, i parallelismi con mondi diversi, o quello che volete, 1Q84 è perfetto. Ah, e poi c'è Aomame, che è semplicemente magnifica."

This is just a looooong book. I loved the ending, the circumstances how it all moved toward that ending. There were a few moments in Book 3, I believe where there was some word for word repetition, even only a few chapters apart that kind of annoyed me.

77,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin,Rating 5 out of 5,"Murakami's new opus, 1Q84 is already being called his masterpiece by the professional reviewers. I think they may be on to something. Here's why.Murakami's artistic vision continues to develop. In the past, his novels could be arguably divided into two areas: 1) The romance, usually in the natural world and usually headed for sorrow, and 2) The existential fantasy where the world is lop-sided in magical realism with the protagonist struggling to understand the surreal. In 1Q84 he finally manages to unite these two themes in a very coherence epic of 900+ pages. His usual suspects of strange women and confused men are here but they are infused with a new sense of wonder and humanity that surpasses his previous works. Also, this is easily the warmest and most romantic of his books. Romantic and warmth are not usually the first words to come to mind when describing Murakami.The plot is quite complex and takes place in the year 1984. A fitness trainer with an interesting second job rushes to meet an appointment and takes a emergency staircase off of the freeway thoroughfare to get there. In doing so, she discovers that the world has changed in small but troubling ways. The most noticeable change in this world which she dubs 1Q84 is that it has two moons. In a parallel tale, a math teacher and would-be writer reluctantly takes a job rewriting the odd fantasy novel of a 17 year old girl. Murakami tells these two stories in alternating chapters, a ploy used that is similar what he uses in his novel Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of The World. The stories merge and this is where it become quite magical as small nuances become major plot twists. While the two main characters are marvelously written there are many minor characters that also become alive and are very essential to the story; a gay bodyguard, a dowager who has an unique answer to domestic violence, and a very persistent television fee collector, to mention only a few. Murakami takes his time slowly molding each incident and each personage into the tapestry. Regular Murakami fans will not be disappointed and new readers to Murakami will enjoy this as long as they are not intimated by the length and have a little patience. To use a term from another Goodreads reviewer,the novel moves at a glacial pace. Yet it is the kind of glacial pace that has huge pieces of ice breaking off and startling the reader at unpredictable times. Almost all of the author's quirks and themes are here but there is an intimacy and involvement in this book that Murakami may have not reached in previous works. He seems to be saying, ""Here I am, like my characters, with all the risks and emotions that we humans are afraid to show but must show."". He still leaves a lot to the reader to figure out and there are plenty of questions left at the end. However, I doubt you will leave this book feeling unsatisfied. You may also have the urge to check out the window to see how many moons are in the sky."
78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74816651-francisca,Rating 4 out of 5,"My review of this book will reflect my conflicting feelings about it, so please bear with me while I ramble…First, Murakami’s ability is plain to see and must be commended; even if he indulges in a sort of narcissistic lecturing on what it takes to be an author (the authorial soliloquy around the part where Tengo utters phrases like: ""The role of a story was, in the broadest terms, to transpose a single problem into another form,"" it’s just borderline self-congratulatory, I think). The story is many things: curious, idiosyncratic, dystopian, fantastical, overtly sexualized, violent but also a times it lags and feels out of momentum. Nonetheless, it's precisely Murakami’s ability that kept me reading.This book grabbed my attention, yes, but only slowly, as the characters little by little start to come on their own, and get linked together through coincidence and Fate yet... by the final pages I put it down disappointed at the abruptness, the many loose ends, and the missing explanations. Murakami hints this would happen with the excerpts from Air Chrysalis which also just stops, but that doesn’t really make up for the missing closure (finishing the book felt a bit like a bad break up. One of those when you simply never fully understand what happened). I do understand that the nature and purpose of a fantastical dystopian novel is to perplex, confuse, beguile. That it's not meant to lead us; rather the words are there as encouragement for us to empathize, to seek our selves in the small people. This story is built to help us relate to the introverted and isolated characters that litter the text. The thing is, for me, the purpose was not always achieved, making the read a slow process that required a lot of my will power to move forward.At times the story propels us forward with forceful impetus, as this book is shocking in its sexual brutality and violence but it is also breathlessly poignant in Tengo's elegance. Yet, for all that this novel is, I was left slightly dissatisfied, which when reading often means I’m not particularly interested in knowing more or even think about the characters and their world. Now, you may be wondering, is it worth the read? Perhaps. The friend that gave it to me as a present was fascinated by it. So, it’s my opinion that you should form one of your own by giving the book a chance."

I didn’t get to the end but I read enough to know that I am finished. (730 pp.) Profoundly finished! I’ve loved Murakami’s past books, but I’ve always been troubled by his writing style, that casual off-handed style that can feel a lot like clumsiness. Part of me suspected the guy just wasn’t a very good writer. 1Q84: suspicions confirmed.You see, I used to think these weak, flabby, foggy sentences were only a façade. I wasn’t supposed to take them at face value. I read into Murakami’s earlier work a particular kind of psychological weirdness i.e. neurosis. It made sense, especially in the first-person stories from The Elephant Vanishes to have characters describing their lives in this off-handed, detached way and then to have that façade ruptured in brief, intense flashes of weirdness. Think of that bizarre attack at the end of “Sleep” that surges like a sudden, violent comeuppance. Or the intruders in “TV People” and their complex, technical project which is both essential and unknowable to the narrator. These seem rooted in the Jungian idea of the Shadow, that mysterious and feared part of ourselves that shows up like a menacing stranger and won’t leave us alone. In these stories I thought I was reading an unreliable narrator contending with an unknown self.But here we have 920 pages in the third person, written in that same weak, flabby, foggy style (in fact, to me it seemed worse), and we have no first-person character to attribute it to, only the writer, Haruki Murakami. Can I even trust Murakami to know when he’s written something worth reading?I do think [1Q84] has been a major step in my career. Formally speaking, this is the first full-length novel I have written from beginning to end in the third person. -Murakami, NYer Book Bench interviewA novel in the third-person, what a landmark. Froshy comments like this make me think I’ve given Murakami too much credit in the past. Murakami has written mysterious stories. That is, they are mysterious for the reader—the narrator’s feeling of mystery is implied. It’s the lack of comment on mystery that adds to, even enhances, the effect. Well-crafted stories rely as much on what isn’t said as what is. In 1Q84, however, Murakami tries to dial up the mysteriousness by having his characters consider (for pages and pages) how mysterious everything is. Oh what could the two moons mean? Why is so much strange stuff happening? What should I do about it? There are entire chapters dedicated to characters asking themselves banal questions about every weird thing in the book. It’s the province of pulp to state the obvious as though it were something new, and all these pointless question marks are a big part of what makes this book so flabby and repetitive. It’s not like there’s enough style to carry such a slow book, either. These sentences are anti-style, but not in a post-modern way. It’s finger-vomiting onto the page with no editing at all. Murakami's at his worst when he’s trying to write descriptively. The following are taken from a skim of the first few pages: “She felt like a lonely castaway on the open sea.” (1. Cliché, 2. Are there unlonely castaways?) “Despite the rather low volume at which [the radio] was playing, the sound had true depth, and the overtones were clearly audible.” (This describes nothing.) “The wrinkles on the back of his neck moved like some kind of ancient creature.” (That doesn’t even make sense. How do wrinkles move like an ancient creature? Do you mean “The wrinkles on the back of his neck moved as though he were some kind of ancient creature”? The lack of clarity here and the useless brushing of “some kind of” typify his descriptive style.)When the characters aren’t asking themselves obvious questions, then they spend pages and pages in dialogue. Aside from perhaps Ushikawa these characters sound all the same and their conversations have none of the fun of human interaction (i.e. the façade-building and the talking around the subject that create the dance of dialogue). Usually the characters just kind of blab on for a while and then finish by making a random decision which is supposed to be profound, but really seems more like a contrivance to keep the plot going. Call it post-modern if you want, but these don’t feel like anti-characters; they simply fail to inspire the imagination. Early on in the novel we learn of the teenage girl, Fuka-Eri, who’s written a raw novel, which has to be edited by another character, Tengo, who is a skilled writer. While at first I thought this might represent the relationship between the artist’s unconsciousness and consciousness, something like the paranoiac-critical method, I couldn’t help but see Murakami as the teenage girl-character, and the Tengo-character as some editor who Murakami forgot to consult this time around.So, why are people going crazy for this novel. There’s a lot of five-star reviews here on goodreads. Well, we tend to to hate changing our minds about things we’ve invested a lot into. This is normal self-justification bias. Perhaps we’ve enjoyed other Murakami books in the past. Perhaps we’ve recommended his books to others, even given his books as gifts. Perhaps we paid twenty-five bucks and read an inexplicable long book in hard-cover when we had plenty of good paperbacks lying around. There’s a lot of incentive there to like what we’ve read. And that bias explains a lot of what I grappled with as I read (most) of this novel. But now I’m grappling with a different bias. How do I not go back to all his past books that I enjoyed so much and see everything I hated about 1Q84 in them?"

And there are books like this one, that are just so darn addictive. I've read two Murakami novels so far--one about after-hours Tokyo, where young people find refuge in, among other late-night places, a maid cafe and a love hotel (After Dark), and one, a serious young person coming of age in the '60s (Norwegian Wood). I enjoyed the first and loved the second. I was hoping for the same kind of experience with this book, which I had randomly downloaded on my Kobo one insomniac night. What it had in common with those books was a very simple, compellingly readable style--this one alternating chapters between two points of view, not particularly complex storytelling--but the story gradually revealed itself to be a creepy alternative reality novel, just when I was hoping for something intimate and realistic.  Yet I could not stop reading it. Aomame is an female assassin, Tengo a young writer working as a math tutor at a Tokyo cram school, and they have something in common, which proves to be the driving force of the book. Tengo has become involved in co-writing a sensational fantasy novel by a mysterious teenaged girl, the gist of which turns out to be very real. And Aomame's story gradually becomes intertwined with that of the girl's weird novel, as well as the tie that surfaces between the two protagonists.1Q84 has more plot than the first two Murakami novels, and yet I can't say his handling of the metaphysical aspect of the story was all that masterful. Clearly the real-life psychological novel is much more interesting to him than the metaphysical world we begin to inhabit, which is fine with me. The characters were all fabulous and I did not have to prod myself to keep reading, but rather, had to force myself to stop--and in a 900 page book that's what you want. It really holds your interest, the characters are people you come to know and care about, it moves quickly and I got a lot of pleasure out of reading. Certain metaphors will stay with me--like Tengo's ""Cat Town"" from a short story he's reading on a train, where strange things are afoot, but if you are too curious and stay too long, the train ceases to stop there and you are trapped forever. So many things in life are like that.I love the detective-thriller aspect of the book, the dowager who runs Aomame's assignments, the search for the truth about the mysterious girl and so on. It ended rather abruptly, without tying up its metaphysical story, but hey, it's Cat Town."

Sve mi se čini da jeste, jer zaista, uprkos svim manama (a ne da ih ima, nego...), 1Q84 mi je dosta prirastao srcu. Na neki način, roman koji se izmedju ostalog bavi sektama i indoktrinacijom, postao je moja sekta. Elem. Glavni i osnovni problem je dužina. Odakle Murakamiju ideja da je ovo roman od hiljadu i kusur strana (nemojte da vas zavara ono trotomni-trodelni; narativa nije ni na jedan način izdeljena te je i takva podela nepotrebna), ja zaista ne znam. Mislim da je on imao jasan razlog zbog čega roman mora biti toliko dug, ali ja ga iskreno ne vidim i mislim da je to dovoljno da se kaže na tu temu. Džaba ti svaka zamisao, ma koliko genijalna bila, kada prosečan čitalac to neće uočiti. Ta prazna poglavlja kojih je roman pun, isprva budu dosledan uvid u tradicionalnu murakamijevsku ravnodušnost, ali nakon n-tog puta i dosade i ništa ne ostave. Reči i reči i reči, a nigde supstance. Podvuče se tu još po koji problem, kao recimo nagao kraj (što volim kada romani od hiljadu plus stranica odvoje circa pet strana za kraj), po koji prazan lik, ali skribomanija je majka kraljica. E sad, vrline, a njih svakako ima. Likovi! Izuzev Tenga, koji izuzev jednog maestralnog poglavlja pred kraj, i nije baš neki (što na neki način jeste poenta, ali malo sam se umorio od tog obrasca), svi ostali su u samom vrhu Murakamijevog celokupnog opusa. Aomame, Tamaru, Ušikava, Fuka-Eri, svi su potpuno vredni pažnje i prosto je milina čitati kada su tu. Opaljeni elementi takodje prave kambek na velika vrata: Mali Ljudi, koncepti maze i dohte u svemu, pa i u mesecima (jer ovde ih je dva, jedan veliki i žuti, naš, i drugi zeleni, kao grašak – a još se neko tako zove). Razne reference na džez i klasiku i ruske klasike, kao i suva atmosferičnost koja tipično krasi Murakamija. Na kraju, i dužina jeste vrlina – jer siguran sam da roman nije trajao ovoliko, ne bi mi bio ni izbliza toliko mrzak, ali ni drag. Poduhvat svakako, ali poduhvat vredan toga. p.s. za sad neka bude jača trojka, pa možda promenim u neocenjeno. 3+"

86,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2976142-thomas-edmund,Rating 4 out of 5,"First of all 1Q(9)84 took me such an epic length of time to get through, I almost feel the depression of a phase of my life having finished, i.e. 2016-17 will always the period of time that I was reading Murakami's work. I've read pieces of equal length before but something about 1Q84 is particularly weighty (not to mention my time is more precious than a few years ago when I had more time to devour epic fantasy and Stephen King books).But where to start? Murakami's work I found oddly similar to Larsson's 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' series. The prose was hyper-detailed, history and backstory was given extra attention. The themes also revolved around misogynistic conspiracy, and the dual female, male MCs were common ground also. In saying that 1Q84 delved into mythology and supernatural elements and ultimately differed notably from Larsson's work in subtle ways.Nonetheless I would expect fans of one to be fans of the other.It's hard to provide much of an overview with any spoilers, as much of the joy of the work is discovering piece by piece what is going on, suffice to say the plot follows two characters: Aomame an aloof and professional woman who doesn't suffer fools and has a rather unique job, and Tengo an aloof (but more in a daydreamy artist kind of way) teacher by day, aspiring author by night. While their stories are separate Murakami seamlessly weaves together their tales to one epic thread.Their were some real strengths to the book. I loved the slow and believable introduction of supernatural and mythical elements, initially especially during book I-(actually this might be a good time to point out that really 1Q84 really is just one huge story across 3 books, they don't sit together particularly well, if at all, as standalone books) - the book actually felt hyper-real, and could have easily continued as a political/psychology thriller, yet when the mythology was introduced it never irked my disbelief or seemed too silly to be real. Second the tone and perspective of the book was really well written, there was consistent narration throughout, yet a unique feel to each point of view, I never lost track of who was who, which has happened in other people's books with multiple characters. Finally I loved the way the two characters' stories were interwoven while being technically separate, there were parts which should have been cheesy AF but were puled off skilfully.Plotwise I had mixed feelings. I really, really liked the first 50% of the boo, particularly the slow-burn but intriguing and enjoyable book one, and the high points of book two. However by the time book three rolled around I started to have some concerns. For some reason Murakami introduces a third points of view character, a man who essentially is tracking the other two characters. While this character technically makes a couple of key plot points happen, they a. could have easily happened without them, and b. could have happened without him actually being a point of view. Much of his page time is spent with him working out the movements of the other characters, which we actually already knew ourselves from their point of view, and overall the third book was INCREDIBLY repetitive, so much so I could have done with only a couple of key chapters and the last few to resolve the story.I feel kind of bad trying to criticize such an epic work, but also I felt there were some major issues with the overall resolution (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT WILL TRY TO KEEP THINGS TIGHT THO) the mythology side of the story isn't ever really fully explained or solved in a truly satisfying way. On the one hand I'm actually okay with this because there is lots of room for interpretation, did all of that supernatural stuff actually happen, or was is all a metaphor for the character's trails, or an exploration of reality and philosophy, or was the real story just about the characters.Also in terms of the more thriller conspiracy type aspects of the story I felt like these were raised and then just left hanging, this is slightly more flawed in my opinion because there was a considerable amount of page time given to characters and plot that felt like they were essentially easily defeated by already established allies (kind of like if Bourne was the badguy and the elite overaching guys were the goodies).So what's the overall verdict. I personally really enjoyed the book, from a purely original perspective and enjoying the craft of the story. To be honest I think Joe Reader looking for an epic storyline that follows convention and presents a clear-cut resounding tale I would hesitate with this one, it's a big investment for a piece that doesn't provide a typical Hollywood ending (at least not 100% of one!)

88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is my favorite of the Murakami books I've read (and I've read about half). Where I sometimes feel distant from or frustrated with his characters, I loved Aomame and Tengo, as well as several of the characters in their periphery. I loved the alternate reality. I loved how music permeated everything, and I listened to the works mentioned during most of my reading of the book (it starts with Janacek and moves through Haydn 'cello sonatas before touching on the St. Matthew Passion and Horowitz's piano playing). I loved the way the story was told, alternating points of view with trailing threads between - it was mastery.The usual silly themes of spaghetti and cats were present, but what Murakami does with cats in this book has to be read to be believed.The only thing I'm not sure about is the little people... that whole idea wasn't resolved to my satisfaction. From what I've read in interviews with the author, they just showed up one day, and I'm not sure he knew what to do with them either.""Aomame said, 'Even if things were the same, people's perception of things might have been very different back then. The darkness of night was probably deeper then, so the moon must have been that much bigger and brighter. And of course people didn't have records or tapes or CDs. They couldn't hear proper performances of music anytime they liked; it was always something special.''I'm sure you're right,' the dowager said. 'Things are so convenient for us these days, our perceptions are probably that much duller. Even if it's the same moon hanging in the sky, we may be looking at something quite different. Four hundred years ago, we might have had richer spirits that were closer to nature."""

91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,Rating 2 out of 5,"(Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com]. I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.)It was an ex-girlfriend in the 1990s who introduced me to the early work of Haruki Murakami, which has made me a big fan ever since; so needless to say that I've been looking forward to the English release of his massive new epic 1Q84, a three-book sensation in his native Japan which was released as a literal thousand-page tome here in the US last October. But alas, after finally finishing it last week, I became acutely aware of just how long it's been since I've stayed abreast of his latest work (besides the slim After Dark from 2007, I haven't actually read any of his new books since 1997's life-changing The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle); because not to put too fine a point on it, but 1Q84 is f-cking terrible, and it makes me wonder now if Murakami has been slowly devolving over the early 2000s to this terrible point, or if this is yet another case of an aging writer deciding that he's going to write his Grand Unforgettable Saga and then simply not being up to the task.Essentially a short story padded out to twenty times its natural length, it tells the intertwined tales of a number of people in 1984 Tokyo as they are affected by a group of malicious spirits known as The Little Ones: there's the serially raped teenage-girl runaway from an apocalyptic cult that gets its cues from these spirits, for example, who has written a tell-all book about her experiences disguised as a Murakamiesque bizarro tale; there's the young novelist who was secretly hired to turn this raw manuscript into a mainstream-friendly book, which has now become a huge bestseller; and then there's his old childhood sweetheart who he hasn't seen in twenty years, a gym instructor who also happens to be a professional assassin, charged by her rich, elderly client with killing only men who abuse women, and making it look like a natural death so that the battered wives will receive the full amount of the life insurance. And granted, that's a very Murakami-sounding setup, especially when you add such strange random details as emergency stairs on the side of an elevated highway that lead to an alternative universe, magical cocoons made out of thin air that contain soul-dead doppelgangers of ourselves, and sexual obsessions over things like big ears and balding men.But instead of weaving this together in his trademark memorable way, which in his '80s and '90s work feels like you're glimpsing some sort of Grimm-like grand cultural mythology that's been mostly forgotten over the centuries, Murakami here plods forward with no subtlety as if he were writing some supermarket-aisle horror potboiler; and then what makes this turn from merely bad to freaking intolerable is what I said before, that the story itself is so thin that most chapters exist solely and exclusively just to get across one single plot point (you know, like a bad JJ Abrams television show that makes you sit through an hour of mediocre crime drama each week, just so that you can learn officially one more thing about the show's mysteries in the last thirty seconds); and with Murakami maintaining the infuriating habit over an entire thousand pages of having a second character literally repeat every single line a first character is telling them, literally so that he can double the length of the book without having to come up with double the story. (Or to misquote The Simpsons: ""The key to comedy is repetition."" ""The key to comedy is repetition?"" ""The key to comedy is repetition!"") And meanwhile, what was promised to be complex references to the concepts introduced in George Orwell's 1984 amounts basically to a couple of characters every hundred pages or so remarking, ""Hey, have you ever read George Orwell's 1984? That's a weird book, isn't it!""; and sadly, this book also continues the troubling tradition among contemporary Japanese literature in general of coming up with creative justifications for including scenes of graphic rape of teenage girls (in this case by arguing that the teenage girls being raped here are actually ghosts, and it's okay to write fetishistically detailed ten-page descriptions of teenage girls being raped when they're ghosts!).A book that would've actually been okay if not so-so if published as 200 pages, it's unforgivable at a thousand, and its breathless embrace by the academic world simply proves once again just how full of sh-t the academic world is. The good news is that this novel has inspired me to put The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle on reserve at my local library, so I can read it again for the first time in fifteen years and see whether my twentysomething memories of it have been playing tricks on me, a review of which will be coming later this year; but the bad news is that, anyway you look at it, 1Q84 is a major and bitter disappointment from what used to be one of the most clever and original writers on the planet, and it does not come recommended.Out of 10: 6.9"
92,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44309339-chris-p,Rating 4 out of 5,"Re-read June-July 2017Two years ago, when I first read 1Q84, I gave it four stars. It being one of the first Murakami novels I'd read, the reasons behind that rating were rather unclear. Now, having read all his works (except for Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman), I maintain my rating, although I have a much clearer idea of what it is that makes Murakami's trilogy great.1Q84 is hard to talk about. You have to experience it in order to have even a vague idea of what it's about. It's not easy to like but, in the end, you either have to leave it or take it as it is. Strip it of all the mumbo jumbo and what you get is a story about continuing what was once started and got interrupted. Of course, doing so would be turning your back to a plethora of symbolisms that make the point much more powerful by giving it depth beyond all logical conventions. Not recommended for readers that need clear-cut plots and explanations or those who aren't familiar with Murakami's style. It's a saga that takes place in a world where there are two moons in the sky and Little People come out of the mouths of dead things to weave cocoons that bear our shadows. Enough said. Afterall, if you can't understand it without an explanation, you can't understand it with an explanation.
If you don't believe in the world and if there is no love in it, then everything is phony. No matter which world we are talking about, no matter what kind of world we are talking about, the line separating fact from hypothesis is practically invisible to the eye. It can only be seen with the inner eye, the eye of the mind.

There were a few parts that would pique my interest and get my hopes up, and then an explosion of boring would happen. And don't forget the awkward sex scenes. You can't have a Murakami novel without those. I don't know why, reading Murakami's sex scenes or any description of the female anatomy CREEPS ME OUT. Ick.I still like you though, Haruki.

96,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50620706-alaina,Rating 4 out of 5,"One of those books that I saw a ton of people reading at one time.. but never had the courage to dive into it myself. Until now..1Q84 was a long book. Good but long. Some things were a bit weird or rubbed me the wrong way but the rest of the book had me in awe. Once I started this massive thing, I didn't want to put it down. Alas, there's this thing called ""work"" and ""sleep"" which are a necessity sometimes. Plus it kind of sucked that I was sick this week. In the end, I did it and enjoyed every page.In this book, you will meet Tengo and Aomame. They were interesting - which I feel like that's all I can describe people lately. Their relationship was weird, if I'm being honest. However, there's something in this book that is even weirder - the alternative version of 1984. Hence the title, 1Q84.I will admit, after reading the synopsis I wanted to dive into this. Even with the reviews being bad or good - I wanted my own opinion. After diving in, I found some things a bit repetitive. Not as bad as Fifty Shades was.. but to a point that I started to notice. Back to the couple/romance, well these two are trying to find each other. Kind of like they are across the universe from one another and they have to fight their way to the other. Or something like that. Once they realize they aren't in Kansas anymore, they wonder if anyone else realizes this.. or if it's just them. Then the romance was good but weird. A lot of things come into play.. and I will forever cringe at the word ""pumping"". Other than all of that, I actually ended up enjoying this book. I think it's like the 3rd or 4th book by this author and I can't wait to dive into the next one."

It feels like an accomplishment, but it's hard to know how to review and rate this. I'm rather of two minds about it.On the one hand, the prose is beautifully crafted, the story is meticulously put together, it explores interesting ideas and does a brilliant job of weaving in references to literature, music, philosophy, and psychology. The characters are interesting and feel lived in even if they aren't always likeable, and the overall plot is strange but in some way satisfying. On the other hand, the text is far too long and includes so many mundane details that it becomes tedious. Strangeness in the plot can veer into things that feel voyeuristic and often unnecessary with content that is difficult to swallow. (i.e. young girls being sexually abused, sex between people with problematic age differences and power dynamics etc.) There is a LOT of violence toward women, and if I had to read about Aomame as a 30-year-old woman disliking her small breasts one more time...*eyeroll*So...three stars I guess?In short, I think there is a lot here that is thoughtful and impressive, but I'm still not sure if it was worth wading through the dullness and the abuse to get there. If you are going to read this, do be aware of what you are getting into because there is a lot of graphic sexual content (consensual and non-consensual), violence, and abuse. I have mixed feelings, but the overwhelming one is being glad to be finally finished! "
98,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65909643-michael,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book was quite a mixed bag for me. I managed to read through it to the end, which I wouldn't have done if it had been awful. At the same time, the book really dragged. It felt so bloated with extraneous material that entire chapters could have been lopped off without taking anything away from the story. And the story, for what it was, seemed muddled and vague. I'm still not entirely sure how I'd describe it. There were many moments of dramatic tension that seemed so lacking in tension that I thought I must be missing something. A chapter would end with something like ""he looked up and saw two moons"" and my reaction was...so what? I mean what was the point of the entire ""alternative universe"" conceit anyway? I never seemed to get it.I know others loved this book, and I'm perfectly willing to think that the fault lies with me, that I'm not the right reader for this book.

I was drawn into the alternating stories of Aomame and Tengo and listened in suspense as their worlds moved closer towards intersecting. I am sad that it is over and sorry to emerge from the world of 1Q84 to the reality of 2016. At least once a year, I need to dive into a novel by Murakami. I still have a few that I haven't read and fortunately, he is still publishing novels. The experience of reading Murakami can be harrowing and disorienting but also wonder-filled.

I think it definitely helped to take a few days break between each of the 3 parts, to more closely emulate how 1Q84 is originally published as a 3 book series. Either way, it was my first time reading a book this long, and also my first dive into the surrealist genre (though I've heard that this book is pretty tame for a Murakami in that sense)Overall, I liked it. It's an epic of bizarre events and interesting characters and I do like the fact that you don't really know what's going to happen next, especially as you get near the end of Book 2 and pretty much most of Book 3. Book 1 took me the longest to get through only because it was a lot of setting up pieces of the puzzle and so it was kind of disjointed and random, but I began to get used to the unanswered questions and just accepting weird things happening in Book 2. I definitely enjoyed Book 3 the most. The ending was a satisfying close for me. It's not really clear to the end why Aomame and Tengo are attracted to each other, but that might just be a commentary on the mysterious nature of love."

The story touches upon many topics including religion’s and family’s role in shaping youth and when the youth break away on their own. Though at times a little repetitive, I enjoyed it and felt it was worth the time I dedicated to it. What I loved most about the book was the power of human connections. I love Murakami’s writing.

107,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16514959-iris,Rating 5 out of 5,"1Q84 by Haruki Murakami was originally written in Japanese. Published in english in 2011. The story takes place mostly in Tokyo, Japan and follows two main characters, Tengo and Aomame. Tengo is a literary prize reviewer, and as he is reading the entries he comes across a captivating story that is written horribly. He then becomes a ghost writer for this short story, to get the story published. Aomame is an assassin that targets men who are domestic abusers. While these characters are leading very different lives, a cult is rising to power, and strange forces are emerging. Murakami expertly weaves these three stories together, as the short story that Tengo writes starts to become reality. 	1Q84 is a response to George Orwell’s 1984. While Orwell asked what would happen if the government was constantly rewriting history, Murakami asks what would happen if one day history was different than how you remembered it. Besides that, Murakami plays with Orwell’s concepts of thoughtcrime and Big Brother. 	A major theme in this book is loneliness. The two main characters lead very isolated lives. They attempt to find companionship, but are denied every time. This starts out as mere unluckiness, eventually the reader realizes that there is a force driving the two main characters together. 	Murakami has a very concrete style of writing across all of his works. Of his books that I have read 1Q84 is the most successful in implementing magical realism effectively. Every fantastical element of this novel is eerily mystical, and will leave the reader unsettled. No matter how creepy these elements are they effectively symbolize the major themes of the plot and create beautiful imagery. Magical Realism furthers the plot and is not just included for shock value.	1Q84 is an enthralling feat of literature. Told in an epic 1,157 pages, the story unfolds with a mastery of style and prose that is like no other. "

Atunci cand imi place foarte mult cum scrie un autor nu ma las pana nu citesc cat mai multe carti scrise de respectivul. Deaceea imi e greu cand vorbesc de o carte sa ma limitez la ea, iar in cazul Murakami imi este si mai greu pentru ca sunt elemente comune in majoritatea cartilor lui. De exemplu dragostea pentru muzica jazz, detaliile cu care descrie anumite feluri de mancare pe care le gateste cate un personaj, referirea la urechile personajelor feminine, care sunt descrise ca femei de o frumusete obisnuita atunci cand au urechile acoperite, iar in momentul cand le se vad urechile devin foarte frumoase .Romanul este impartit in 3 volume cu acelas titlu. Actiunea se petrece in Tokyo, 1984. De la inceput am crezut ca este anul real, dar pare a fi un an fictional, intr-un univers paralel, nu sti care este cel real, si cate lumi sunt de fapt….Impactul cu lumea asiatica traditionala nu este atat de pegnant ca in alte carti ale lui Murakami, are o tenta occidentala. Cartea are personaje interesante, actiune, situatii imprevizibile, ritm alert, si apar niste oameni mici care tes o crisalida. Ha, v-am bagat in ceata ?Personajul principal este o tanara de profesie asasin care fara sa vrea trece intr-o lume paralela, iar diferenta majora pe care o vede este aparitia pe cer a doua luni de culoare mai verzuie … Avem si poveste de dragoste, suspans, crima, intamplari si peronaje ciudate, momente hilare, dar si inspaimantatoare.Nu sunt putini cei care mi-au spus ca nu il inteleg, sau ca nu le place Murakami, ca e un ciudat nesuferit si ca romanele lui nu au substanta. Mie imi place si-mi place muuult, dar recunosc, stilul lui nu este pentru oricine.

At times it gets really repetitive; like the author has thought the reader has already forgetting information about Aomame or Tengo. 1Q84 is the story of two people who meet and fall in love in school and then, many years later spend the entirety of the book trying to find each other again. As the story obviously isn’t as simple as that; it is fair to say it is very weird and probably what you expect from Haruki Murakami. I’ve not read anything else from him and I don’t pretend to understand the genre Magical Realism but this book was indeed somewhat enjoyable to read.I mentioned that this book was everything you’d expect from Murakami and that I’ve never read anything by him before. But I do know of his works and I’ve seen the movie adaptation of Norwegian Wood so I had a decent idea of what I was getting into. But I didn’t except what I got. As the story unfolds and you get a better understanding of Aomame and Tengo, you can’t help but love these two characters with all their flaws, quirks and of course their personalities.While this book was way too long, I am very glad to have read this book and to dive into the parallel world of 1Q84. I do feel more of a book snob for reading this and I think I will have to read some more from this weird author. For people looking for a great but odd story about two people and have a lot of time to spare, then I would suggest this is the book for you."

111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5476515-amanda,Rating 5 out of 5,So far September has been an absolutely fantastic month of reading. This is classic Murakami and probably my favorite although The Wind Up Bird Chronicle will always hold a special place. This is a bit of a genre mashup. Part fantasy and part sci-fi but it's also a surreal love story. I loved the alternating chapters of Tengo and Aomame and the threads that wove their stories together. At 1157 pages this book is somewhat of an investment but it's one I'm glad I made and I would have gladly read another 500 pages about these two characters. 
112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92989670-chloe-howard,Rating 5 out of 5,Ugh. This was as good as it was long. Such an epic read. Loved every minute of it. 
113,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29163734-marc-dark-reader-with-a-thousand-young-i,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have only read this and one other full-length novel of Murakami's (The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle) but I think he is one of my favorite authors. The way that his characters think and speak and philosophize is so wonderfully foreign and intriguing to me, and his novels' events are so bizarre, I find the whole affair simply delicious. There are many mysteries and questions raised over the course of this heavy tome, which was initially published as three separate books in Japan. If you are not familiar with Murakami's books, a good thing to know going in, is that none of these questions will be answered, none of the mysteries resolved, in any way that you may be accustomed to. I imagine that this could be particularly infuriating to many readers of 1Q84, given its length and required time investment. By the end, this book abandoned many threads that I would love to have followed further. Characters move forward and may achieve satisfaction, events unfold at a regular pace, and many burning questions may seem to start to be addressed, but the answers are not really answers in the traditional sense and only generate more confusion if you are looking for a narrative that fits with things like logic or the real world. I suppose this book counts as magical realism, but of a particularly Japanese brand. There is a terrific pie chart on the internet breaking down a Murakami novel that includes segments such as ""preparing food"", ""dissociative females"" and ""ears"" that rings incredibly true for this book. Music, particularly classical and jazz, gets a lot of air time in 1Q84, as do descriptions of breasts (particularly from the female protagonist, most oddly towards the very end of the book when she suddenly muses about the differences in the breasts of her two past best friends at a very inopportune time). Moons, ringing phones, knocking on doors, trains, parks, ""The Bull"", exercise, and loneliness fill the rest of the pages. I have to think that all great books have to be set in a pre-internet age (or a fantasy setting that removes that option) to remain interesting, lest characters simply google for any information they are lacking. Want to know if there are really two moons in the sky but afraid other people will think you are crazy if you ask? Too bad Aomame couldn't just look it up (although didn't they have libraries in Tokyo in the 80's? Or even non-fiction books in stores?). I loved this book as a physical object; yes it is heavy, but I appreciated the design that went into the Knops hardcover release. There are several spare pages at the beginning and end, as well as page numbers that change location on every page and are reflections of each other on opposite margins, that enhanced the dreamlike quality and mirror reality aspect of the story. Those are my random thoughts, a couple of months after I finished the book. Should you read it? I would not start reading Murakami here, because you may not understand what you are getting into. Start with The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle or another shorter novel instead, then come back here if you like what you find. "
114,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63656912-padmaja,Rating 4 out of 5,"Before I begin with the review, I would like to quote a line from Kafka on the shore, which best suits the story of 1Q84:""According to Arostophanes in Plato's The Banquet, in the ancient world of legend there were three types of people. In ancient times, people weren't simply male or female, but one of three types: male/male, male/female or female/female. In other words, each person was made out of the components of two people""~1Q84 definitely kept me on the edge of my seat, it's an experience in itself reading it. It wasn't a difficult read, given it was 1300 pages long, the pace was even throughout. Let's discuss the book now.Meet our Murakami characters, Aomame, a cold blooded assassin and a gym instructor and Tengo, a maths teacher who teaches at a cram school and writes occasionally on the side. Both of them are looking to complete their incompleteness and embark on a dangerous journey which will plummet them to a world with two moons, and their fates are intertwined here. This world, haunted by the mysterious Little people, where there is no exit but...I loved the alternating chapters which were narrated through Tengo and Aomame. There is a genius in this book's premise. Perhaps Murakami was trying to experiment and also test his reader's patience with this book.⚪🌑At its core, it is a love story of Tengo and Aomame, with surrealistic elements. As it was Murakami, expect a lot of The Great Gatsby references and a healthy blend of Greek myth+Russian literature.I loved the parts which described Modern day Japan, it's culture and the impact modernization is having in it.However I have my complaints with the book too. The story became a tad bit repetitive in the second and third half of the book. I wasn't happy with the ending. I was left with a lot of questions, and I needed the answers to them. I was expecting a kickass conclusion, since the buildup was so fantastic. But I made my peace with it, because as Mr Murakami quotes in the book, ""If you don't understand it without an explanation, you can't understand it with an explanation""3.5⭐#thebookishtalesreviews #harukimurakami #translatedjapaneseliterature"
115,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30718608-brian,Rating 5 out of 5,"This girl named Aomame becomes an assassin taking down dangerous men using a tiny pick as she poses as a masseuse. The story follows her lonely, efficient life, her only love a boy she knew for only seconds when they were ten, and magic flowed at the mutual touch of hands. Tengo, that boy, now thirty, hopes to be a novelist, writes constantly but still hasn't broken through into his ""voice."" His editor asks him to ghostwrite for this story called ""Air Chrysalis,"" and he meets the seventeen-year old girl who wrote it so he can aid her in a rewrite and attempt to win a prize. These three characters develop the story with their individual paths. Two worlds, two moons. ""Little People,"" which I like to rephrase, ""creepy little freaks who climb out of carcass mouths.""At the end I felt a depth of resonance in this book, an intertwining of two desires: love and another world. Realism destroys them both. Reality hits. Hearts break. Intellect, conditioning, reasoning and experience diminish the ability we had as children to believe such a magical place, an other place, could exist. Murakami revives that in the heart. Love and another world. Could they be possible? Could they be real?I adore this writer. He has what I need in fiction, really gives my mind the sharpness and clarity, the escape I need to come back and face reality with a more efficient mind. Some parts drag on but, like Dickens, if you hold out until the end you will get a payment for your time investment. The payment I received will stay with me perhaps for the rest of my life. That resonance only the greatest fiction can give you. Does it still live in your heart like that moment you read the last page? That kind of quality.I'm so glad I read this. If you need a break from reality and you need to live in a world where the impossible becomes possible, if you need hope to rise that somewhere, in some reality, those ""other"" things may be real, read it. Beautiful. Gorgeous. Story."
116,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12202445-evgeniya,Rating 5 out of 5,"Намирам ""1Q84"" за най-плътния Мураками-ев роман (с уговорката, че има 2-3 неща, които не съм прочела все още). В книгата има много от спокойната абсурдност на ежедневието, с която Мураками заразява, много за тази магична свързаност между хората, която неизменно смайва на фона на сякаш напълно нелогичното функциониране на света, в който съществуваме... Най-хубавото обаче е, че тези теми са поднесени по толкова деликатен начин в рамките на сюжет, който се движи по идеално прави линии. Използвам този израз, защото самото четене на ""1Q84"" мога да сравня с едно пътуване във влак, което сякаш се разтяга до безкрайност, докато загубиш усещането за движение, защото си се потопил изцяло в ритъма на влака, като в приятна безтегловност.Освен това в книгата има толкова много препратки (сякаш всички сме по следите на изгубеното време), звучи толкова много музика, но се усеща и толкова много тишина в отделни епизоди. Именно такъв ритъм отива на един истински постмодерен роман, и именно такъв обем. Изцяло бях погълната от книгата, докато я четях, признавам си, до самия край и трябва да кажа и, че точно третата част ме беше обсебила най-коварно и най-очарователно."

119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25923230-youkneek,Rating 3 out of 5,"1Q84 is a 1300+ page omnibus of a fantasy series that was originally published as a trilogy in Japan. I really enjoyed the first two books, but I started to get frustrated with some things by the third book. It’s difficult to explain what it's about without spoiling anything, so I’m going to be vague. The official book synopsis has a much more coherent explanation, but would spoil some of the fun of discovery. Details are revealed very slowly, and piecing it all together was part of the fun. The story is set in Japan in the 80’s and the chapters alternate between two 30-year-old characters: Aomame, a woman, and Tengo, a man. Early in the book Aomame murders a man, a job she was apparently hired to do, for reasons that are hinted at but not fully explained until later. Meanwhile, Tengo gets involved in a scam to rewrite a novella written by an unusual young girl. As these two characters go about their separate lives, little bits of strangeness start to creep in that don’t fit with the reality they thought they knew. This would probably be classified as magical realism.For a good portion of the first book I wasn’t too sure what was going on, but I was very interested in the story in spite of that. I’m not sure I liked the characters exactly, but I was interested in them. In the second book, the pieces started forming a more coherent picture and I remained equally interested. In the third book I realized that, while the pieces were starting to form a picture, there were gaps between those pieces that were never going to be filled in to make a seamless picture. There were events and explanations that were clearly intended to connect to other events and “explain” how things happened, but they usually didn’t stand up well to any sort of logical scrutiny. It was like somebody tried to fit together puzzle pieces where the shapes didn’t quite match up even though the colors matched.The writing style felt unique and different at first, and I really enjoyed it for the first couple of books. By the third book though, some aspects started to grate on my nerves. This book is full of repetition, in different forms. Entire paragraphs are repeated when a character is remembering something they were told or had read. Characters also tended to go over the same details repeatedly in their head. In dialogue, characters would frequently repeat to each other what they had just been told. It all got to be a bit much after a while, especially toward the end when I was just ready to be done with it. In the third book, a third POV character was introduced and that entire POV was pretty much a repetition of things we already knew. It did have a purpose, but the content was boring to read about because so much of it was familiar.My review sounds more negative than it probably should. Throughout the first two books, I would have rated this at 4 stars. It was only in the last book that I started to get frustrated, and that colors my opinion of the whole trilogy. I particularly enjoyed the Japanese setting, which I haven’t encountered much in my reading. The writing style was also different from what I’m used to, and I enjoyed that newness for the first two thirds. The story was interesting and I really enjoyed the way things were revealed slowly and from different angles. My biggest problem was that I wasn’t satisfied with how it was all (not really) tied together by the end. After reading 1300+ pages, I wanted to be more satisfied by the ending. "
120,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david-rubenstein,Rating 3 out of 5,"This imaginative novel has a host of characters, but there are three main characters: Aomame is a sports/physical therapy trainer, and Tengo, a writer/mathematician. The third key character is Fuka-Eri, a 17-year-old girl who grew up in a religious cult, and escaped at the age of 10. Fuka-Eri wrote an imaginative novel, and Tengo is persuaded by his editor to be a ghost-writer, to rework the novel so that it is more literary.When I first started reading this novel, I was just sucked into the story. For some reason--it pulled me in. Each chapter alternates between the points of view of the main characters. After reading the first two chapters, I thought that the book was a collection of short stories. There was simply no connection between them. It takes quite a while before the connection becomes clear. And there are surprises--I thought I understood Aomame by the end of the first chapter--boy, was I wrong!Although I have classified this book as ""fantasy""--it really is not fantasy. It is not moralistic and would be better classified as ""supernatural"". The characters slip from the real world of 1984 into a parallel world of 1Q84. In this world, there are little people who walk out of the mouths of dead animals and people, and two moons. Otherwise, the story is based on reality with occasional inexplicable happenings.This is also a romance; Aomame and Tengo last saw each other 20 years ago while in grade school. They both would like to see each other again, but Aomame admits that she is not willing to go out of her way to find Tengo. She prefers to leave such a meeting to fate.All that said, I found the book starting to become tedious after a while. It is far too long--it could easily be cut in half without missing crucial components. The flavor became repetitive, and at a certain point the surprises petered out, and the plot became somewhat predictable.However, this book was translated from Japanese to English by Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel--and the translation is masterful. The novel reads as if it were originally written in English. Kudos to the translators!"

Aomame grows up into a sports instructor, and something else... whereas Tengko, the maths genius teaches maths in a Cram school, but his real passion is writing.Aomame happens to climb down an improbably situated stairway, and Tengko happens to ghost write a genius book called 'Air Chrysalis' initially written by Fuka Eri, a surreal, beautiful 17 year old girl who has escaped her parents who follow a cult.These 2 bizarre events link them somehow....Then come the Little People, who love building Air Chrysalis and who have had interactions with Fuka Eri. They are not happy with the book.Fuka Eri's parents and her current guardian are an enigma.Into all this Komatsu, an editor and Ushikawa a lawyer turned seedy private detective also tumble in. Actually Komatsu is the one who persuades Tengko to ghost write Air Chrysalis, so that it has a chance to win a prestigious literary award.Then real and surreal events occur one after the other, most of which are witnessed by the two moons in the sky.. the real yellow cheesy one, and the smaller greenish mouldy one which is almost like a daughter moon.After extremely interesting bizarre events, the story culminates..... satisfactorily..

123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1991298-anna,Rating 2 out of 5,"Colour me unimpressed with this 1300+ page exercise in pedantry!This could have been great if the trilogy were, in fact, a standalone novel, albeit a longer one.The first book was captivating enough, I didn’t mind the slow pace and wondered where all this 1Q84 craziness of parallel universes and shady religious cults might lead. Because there were lots of intriguing things being introduced, I didn’t pay much attention to the repetition of certain descriptive phrases. I loved Aomame from the very first pages, her stone-cold badassery in sending men who are violent towards women to “another world.” I loved everything about the odd Tamaru & dowager duo, and, even though I didn’t particularly care for Fuka-Eri’s whereabouts, I liked her dynamic with Tengo. However, I found the author’s treatment of Fuka-Eri’s character simply distasteful, making her an apathetic nymph, whose breasts, “startlingly large and firm for a girl with such a slim body,” are constantly being addressed whenever she encounters the male gaze™. Another thing that annoyed me was the compulsive descriptions of male genitalia, but hey… at least, in this one, we have some resemblance of mystery going on!The second book is where things get even slower, descriptions longer, repetitive, often unnecessary and quickly forgettable; nothing seems to be happening and some of the events in the first book are frequently being recollected and dissected in the two main characters’ thoughts. By the end of book two, I lost all hope for a suitable explanation for the mystery behind 1Q84, the two moons, and the “Little People.”Come the final book in the trilogy, a third POV is introduced, in that of the slimy, utterly displeasing Ushikawa, a character who starts an investigation - basically the author’s pretext to regurgitate more than half of the plot from the previous books, describe characters we already know or don’t care for, rewrite familiar episodes with no point other than filling the pages. Ushikawa’s personal history and his work/eating/sexual routines are not relevant to the main plot, yet meticulously described, while his inner monologues are as interesting as watching paint dry.If that wasn’t annoying enough, I find it hard (pun very much intended) to believe that a history of the protagonist’s erections is essential to his overall characterization. Or Aomame’s touching and rubbing of her slightly larger pregnancy breasts vital to her character development… Then there are passages from books (real or fictional, I don't even care at this point) that the characters read, plus Tengo and Aomame’s dreams… and more dreamssss… This might be intriguing for younger readers, but I’m over this dream thing in a book where magic realism is already the governing “rule”! Murakami could have spent more time on figuring out a way to tie all the loose ends together and less on pointless descriptions and insipid comparisons: “Decisive people, minds fixed on the task, clothed in thick, grey uniforms, working silently from morning to night to make clouds, like bees make honey, spiders make webs, and war makes widows.” This was my first - and possibly only - encounter with Murakami’s fiction. Had I read it years ago, when I bought the damn thing, I might have enjoyed it more. We’ll never know… “Yeah, but you should try reading this or that book of his, they’re way better, I hear you say…” I’ve already read three (see what I did there?), so it’s a no from me! *removes all of Murakami’s novels from TBR & wishlists*Book I -

125,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/744602-lori,Rating 4 out of 5,"So far the narrative straight forward and enjoyable. But I know I'm in the world of Murakami and already approaching it with a foreboding of spook - that things are not what they seem. The only weirdness so far is that the Tokyo policemen's uniform are inexplicably different. A change in color and powerful guns. Our female character notes that guns were never used before. But with the typical Murakami mentality she is not questioning but pursues the usual activities. A good female protagonist. Tengo, the man, is still somewhat of a Murakami blank being presented with a startling proposition. As usual, the characters are loners. I'm very intrigued!2/15/12 - I finished this months ago, and it still lingers. I wasn't sure what to rate this, anywhere from 3 - 5? At times I dreaded reading it, but once I started again I had no idea why I was resistant. Obviously it echoed something disturbing in my soul - ah, of course, the Little People were creepy as hell, like a childhood recurring nightmare. The thing that's amazing about Murakami is how far out and surreal his worlds are BUT at the same time I've never read such grounded stuff. He concentrates on all the details of the tasks we do everyday - the cooking prep, the market shopping. It's a fantastic juxtaposition. And that's why I love him.I've grown to not worry about what it all means, at least on a conscious level. It's like a dream, where it all makes sense - until you awake. Leaving behind echoes of archetypal stuff."

I was not bored once, and being honest sometimes with such a full book there are times a reader will start to lose interest. Not so with 1Q84! There is so much to think about and it is very strange. One cannot be distracted while reading because it is much like dreaming.It is fragmented, allusive, confusing and yet alive and electric. One definitely feels as if they have climbed into the author's mind with a map made of symbols that are on the edge of your recognition. I always feel this way after reading Haruki's novels and his creations always stay with me. I admit, I spent a lot of time thinking about this one, just wondering if I understood it. The love in this novel is beautiful and strange, but you certainly get a feel that sometimes the seemingly smallest moments of kindness or love become a source we return to that feeds and nurtures us. I can't explain this novel, it has to be read. You have to go down the rabbit's hole, so to speak, yourself to decide what it means to you. It is strange, brutal, beautiful and you will be invested. Even if a character seems cold, they will still touch something in you. Yes, I recommend this book to people that don't read lightly. If you want a light, sweet read- this is not for you. If you don't like to be submerged when you read, then you won't be able to enjoy this. "

As Murakami writing style is very unpredictable and full of unusual happenings, thus one need not try to wrap their head around the story and make sense out of it, but this book in particular, did not hit off the right places where it should have been.1Q84 is an imaginary year, seemingly there exist parallel universes and the story revolves around a girl in her late twenties Aomame and a guy of same age Tengo, both are strangers to each - other in this point of time, only to end up in being the soulmates they were meant to be. Also there is one more girl of significance, who is sensational yet miserable, she brings magic realism with her in the story. The book is consolidation of 3 books, each depicting the happening took place in certain months of a year, as the story progress, people get connected, story gets intense, secrets are being reveled but the after math remain enigmatic and open-ended.This time Murakami let downs, but hey I'm not giving upon you for you are, and shall remain my my favorite forever! Peace out. :)"
128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2345554-kasa-cotugno,Rating 5 out of 5,"If you're going to settle into a 925 page dystopian fantasy set in Japan, you either buy into it right at the start or not at all. And to keep you going until the end, the story has to remain intriguing throughout so you don't invest several days and then give up somewhere in the middle. Murakami weaves his magical unrealism with his usual deft touch, even if there is quite a bit of repetition here, moreso than usual. But the atmosphere, mystery, unreality grabs you, and just when you think you've got it figured out, throws you a curve. There are inside jokes abundantly on display -- one of my favorites is when the heroine finds herself plowing through Proust, all six volumes, being caught up in another world lovingly described to the finest detail. A worthy comparison to this work in which no sight, sound or smell is too insignificant to omit. Each character is asmost cinematically portrayed, but to film this would be a disaster. I can think of other unworldy classics that have been filmed to disappointing results (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, for example). But Murakami sets his narratives against a totally believable, recognizeable backdrop that is slightly to the left of reality. Worth the effort. Worth the time."

Започнах книгата с предубеждение, може би защото не съм очаквала японски автор да пр��яви такава фантазия и дар слово. Още в началото ме плени и ме завладя. Изключително ми хареса това, че Мураками паралелно развива няколко от героите си, като главни са Аомаме и Тенго. Останалите ги въвежда покрай тях, и не ги оставя претупани, напротив- запознава ни изкусно и с тях. Заедно с героите си, Мураками поднася и техните истории с голямо майсторство, като лека полека ги свързва. Всичко е толкова премерено; фабулата постепенно се надига и точно това ме държеше заинтригувана над книгата. Прелиствах с интерес и дори за миг не ми дотегна. Уникален е Мураками, уникален. Харесаха ми и подробностите, и отклоненията, и препратките, всичко. Дозира всеки един компонент толкова прецизно, че да се получи шедьовър. Подправил е творбата си с лъжичка любов, щипка секс, чаша фентъзи и няколко капки религиозност. ""1Q84"" е първата ми среща с Мураками и определено няма да е последната.

Some parts are disturbing - there is some abuse and violence here. Aomame and Tengo are characters who get under your skin. The parallel world with two moons was very interesting to visit.

Too bad I was disappointed by this latest Murakami book (I must correct that, he also published a new book in 2013, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage). I am helplessly in love with other Murakami novels, but I'm afraid he'll never win the Nobel prize because of 1Q84...I've seen the mixed reviews, but curiosity got the better of me. I was even prepared to ditch the book if I didn't like it. That was the problem: I loved it in the beginning. The first part is engrossing, magical, full of fantasy and mystery, a typical Murakami that makes you feel good no matter what. Towards the second part, it gradually began to slack and I was gradually awakening from its spell. When I got to part three, I was hoping for a change of pace, but it was even worse: that part was boring, repetitive, almost shallow; just a few interesting things happened. I read it at high speed because I had already wasted enough time. Moreover, the writing was at times a bit too commercial for my taste, like the describing of brand clothes. I also found it hard to take seriously the ""relationship"" between Tengo and Aomame. I didn't choose a chick-lit book, for Christ's sake! So my advice to you: don't begin to read 1Q84, because you'll be swept into its magical world and you won't stop reading. You'll probably notice how bad the story gets, but still you'll crawl towards the finish in order to find out what is happening. I have another warning at this point: you won't really get a satisfying ending; the Little People mystery will remain unsolved. Is there a fourth book and I don't know about it? There were some awesome moments in this book, though: the mysterious NHK collector that banged at people's doors, vehemently declaiming his monologue I suppose this was in fact Tengo's father, while he was lying in a coma; the nurse had said he was still banging with his fist in the bed.; the creation of the air chrysalis by the Little People; the connection between Maza and Dohta (by the way, the Romanian translation used the terms Mater and Filia, which I find better suited); the tale of the Cat Town; the misshapen, greenish second moon in the night sky; the story of the Gilyaks (although I have to thank Chekhov for that). There was magic, yes there was. For these unique moments, I don't truly regret reading 1Q84.The music and literature references are present, as usual. Janáček’s Sinfonietta was the recurring musical theme (you can listen to it here). A premiere (at least for me) were the whole excerpts from books - Chekhov's Island of Sakhalin and Isak Dinesen/Karen Blixen’s Out of Africa. A surprise was the resurfacing of Ushikawa, a slimy character that also appears in The Wind-up Bird Chronicle. I didn't recognize his name, but his description reminded me a lot about the vile man that budged into Toru Okada’s life. I hated Ushikawa then and I hated him now, so I didn't see the point in his taking up the stage to such an extent, even becoming the third perspective in book three. I was not interested in this character, I didn't want to find out more about his dog, wife and children. I didn't want to feel pity for him. He should have been the evil character. I was relieved that he died, although I didn't enjoy his way of dying.Now that I think of it, nobody in this novel seems to be entirely bad, they all have mitigated circumstances. Who was the bad guy here, may I ask?I am left with a lot of questions The Little People exiting Ushikawa's mouth at the end, mean that the connection was reestablished? Who were the Little People and what did they want? Was Fuka-Eri the real thing or the Dohta? What was the other Fuka-Eri doing? And so on. and I wonder whether I should waste more time reading further about the novel or simply forget about it... "

In a week I was done and ready to reflect on whatever the book left me with. One obvious thing is, the more the book expands its universe* the more it loses its intensity.Objectively speaking, it gets to that point where it's like a balloon, inflating, getting filled with more (hot) air. So there are a few places where the narrative is clunky. But I am generous. Making a critique does not mean being malicious, as so many comment-leavers on a literary blog seem to think. One in particular left me baffled: ""Murakami seems to not be going anywhere with his stories"". Other people found the book ""slow"". When I hear that, I think, how many Hollywood action films have you seen to condition you into believing that fast is better? Grumble grumble. ---------1Q84 explores subjects Murakami has already dealt with in one shape or other: the splitting of consciousness -- Sputnik Sweetheartthe effects of a religious cult on peoples' lives -- Undergroundthe Shadow, entrance/exit to other worlds -- Kafka on The Shore, The Wind-Up Bird ChronicleI'm used to reading this guy's books, creeping in on them in Japanese as well, so I have lost that will to dissect. Usually it takes two reads to clarify things for yourself without depending on the writer to give his opinion. Once he makes the text available to the public, it's no longer his text. So be pleased that you can apply whatever logic you want to books like this.Murakami will be straightforward and explain quite a lot of things within the narrative. That actually bothers me some times, as I like to make my own connections at my own pace.The story is definitely interesting, with its highs and lows, as you would expect from a 1000-page thing. What keeps me going is this: I imagine everything in a very cinematic way, so here's a tip for all the nay-sayers- instead of just reading Murakami, try seeing what he's saying. I don't trust people who don't like Murakami- it seems to me they're lacking in imagination.Anywho, the two main characters: Aomame is interesting, and Tengo isn't. In fact, towards the end it's like he's not even there and Murakami can't be bothered with giving him human-like responses to situations. Needless to say I don't like the personality Tengo was given. Aomame though, is charming, mysterious, and an appealing character for those interested in extramorals and going beyond good and evil.I'm left with the need to look up most of the music (though the good folks at BookTunes did all the work already) and locate a copy of Sakhalin Island, plus learn how to kick a guy in the balls. * and it is an expansion, since Murakami simply based this novel on his short story, Seeing the 100% Perfect Girl"
133,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26480778-phee,Rating 4 out of 5,"Honestly I'm really not sure on what I feel about this book. It bloody long, really slow paced (As are most Japanese books), and to be honest raised far more questions than it answered. This took me around a week to read which is about my standard when it comes to books over 1000 pages. Though I will say it certainly didn't feel that long whilst I was reading. Sometimes long books feel three times there actual length while you're reading. To be honest I think that's down to Murakami's writing. It mesmerises you, and holds you in its grip. I found making progress on this quite easy in the end. As always the translation is really accessable. I think that some people are hesitant to try Murakami because they think his work will be too difficult to read. Whilst in reality, the writing is super easy to read in my opinion. His ideas are a little far fetched and out there. But his writing is solid. This is one of his weirder novels. If you've read any number of his work then you'll know that he writes magical realism into most of his work. Sometimes it's only slight, an almost whisper that you might miss if you're not paying attention. This one isn't one of those novels. This one features alternate worlds, cults, little people coming out of dead goats mouths(amongst other things), and some pretty questionable sex scenes. Just to name a few things. It all felt typical Murakami for me at this point. I've read everything he's got translated into English apart from his latest novel Killing Commendatore. So I have a very good grasp on what his themes and plot devices at this point. But this wasn't boring despite all this. As the story progresses it kept me guessing and I'm still guessing now it's finished. Contrary to popular opinions, I actually like the way Murakami ends his books. They normally don't give the reader closure, which your either going to enjoy or not to be honest. I don't mind it most of the time. You'll have noticed that I haven't really mentioned anything about the plot or characters. To be honest I went into this book completely blind. I rarely read the blurb of any book I read. Especially when it's an author I've read previously. I find that so many blurbs don't give an accurate representation of the story or give too much away so I don't like to read them. If you're interested in seeing what the story is about then there are blurbs and descriptions all over the other reviews for this book. You don't need me to give you one. I'm giving this book 4 stars for now. This may change over time, but I'm certain it's not a 5 star read for me. 4.5 maybe. And among my favourites by Murakami. I can't believe that I only have one of his books left. I'm quite apprehensive about reading the last book. But I'm also pleased about reading all of his work in a relatively short amount of time, considering the quantity of it. Watch the moon closely. How many do you see?"
134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el,Rating 3 out of 5,"There have been a few conversations that occurred in my home while I was finishing this book today. They all involved my boyfriend trying to talk and me yelling ""BITCH, C'MON!"" To break up some of the monotony of this, occasionally I'd give him a rundown on where I was in the reading process. ""C'mon, 100 more pages!"" ""Babe, just 45 more pages...""What's funny is to look at what I just wrote makes it sound like I was really involved in this book and he was distracting me from a really awesome story and I was gonna cut him. In reality, while it was a fine book, the majority of my ire directed at him and his mouth was that a) this book is due at the library tomorrow and I refuse to extend this check-out and b) I just wanted to finish the fucking book. Sweetie-baby, I promise I will rub your feet when I'm done, just please let me finish this book before my fucking head explodes. Head-explosion doesn't help anyone.I turned into a dude watching a football game while reading this book. ""You can talk all you want if you just let me finish this, I'm almost done, hold on, don't fall apart yet..."" Total role reversal in this joint tonight.So. The thing is that I don't really like Murakami all that much. I've read him, and I continue to read him, but when I'm done I wonder why I took the time. It's not that it's all shit-poor, but there's always something lacking. This is a really long book, over 900 pages, and while normally that gives me a reason to get out of bed in the morning, these 900+ pages were sort of... unnecessary. It's filled with a lot of repetitious details, boring sequences that don't move the plot along, and it's like Murakami was trying to pull a David Lynch with this one. And, c'mon, let's be honest. No one can be David Lynch but David Lynch.It's a crazy story, and it's really no bad, but (like my reviews, ahem) it went on entirely too long. Except, unlike my reviews, Murakami gets paid the big bucks and there's no excuse for it.I'm sure someone is going to try to make a movie of this at some point and I'll totally see it. It'll be totally Hollywoodized and it'll be like, I dunno, Jesse Eisenberg and Amanda Bynes and I'll hate it. But if it's done right it could be pretty decent.Whatever, I'm just happy to be done."
135,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2352900-elaine,Rating 5 out of 5,"As with so many of the things the characters in 1Q84 do, I'm giving this book 5 stars based on a feeling, without being able to say why using deductive reasoning. Which is only fitting, since Murakami repeatedly shows us the limits of logical thought. Murakami creates a world, or two, or three, that I thoroughly enjoyed spending slightly over two weeks in. I always wanted to pick up the Kindle and spend more time in the quirky (even if often repetitive and often slow yet other times thrilling) minds of Tengo and Aomame. The entire experience reminded me quite a bit of Infinite Jest, although Murakami is less dazzingly cerebral and more interested in the human heart. But there are similarly a million mysterious allusions, doublings, echos, and also similarly, a million loose ends that are not ""solved"" at the book's conclusion, although in both cases I never stopped hoping (deductive reasoner that I am) that they would be. Nonetheless, Tengo and Aomame are almost uniquely likeable in recent fiction I've read. Both are quirky, damaged, and questing -- but somehow both totally win our sympathy and affection, so that you keep going even when the trappings don't quite synch up. Oddly, despite all the self-referential stuff on writing and the intertextual shout outs to Proust, Chekhov, etc., what this book is most is an utterly surreal but warm and compelling love story.  My first Murakami -- but now that I'm no longer intimidated, there will be more."
136,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37081848-carme,Rating 4 out of 5," Yo sólo me pregunto... ¿por qué? ¿Por qué tiene que ser tan injusto? Si soy sincera, 1Q84 (Libros 1 y 2), es una de esas historias que tardan en arrancar. Las casi primeras 200 páginas pueden hacerse un poco cuesta arriba, más que nada porque no acaba de orientarse el rumbo que debe seguir la historia - o sí lo hace, pero de forma tan vaga que ciertas explicaciones pueden hacerse pesadas -. El tema está en que, cuando arranca, lo hace a lo grande. Y a mí me ha flipado. No es ningún secreto que a Murakami le gusta jugar con la realidad. Dibujarla y desdibujarla, con una lógica aplastante que hace que se acepte sin más. Podríamos compararlo, sin tener absolutamente nada que ver, con un realismo mágico de toques un poco grotescos. Pero no importa, comparaciones a parte es una historia que vale la pena. ¿Y por qué? Por sus protagonistas. Sin duda, mi favorita ha sido Aomame. Esa mujer, esa Señora - sí, con mayúsculas -, tiene una fuerza de voluntad que me ha dejado bizqueando. Es fuerte porque debe serlo, sin cuestionarse si puede o no estar a la altura. Tengo, por su parte, ha sido muy dulce. Un chico más bien metido para adentro, que vive el día a día sin prisas, hasta que un día se ve envuelto en algo bastante... turbio. No os quiero contar nada, porque ir a ciegas con esta historia es un acierto. Os pido paciencia con el principio, eso sí. Luego Murakami se encargará de que valga la pena cada página. Palabrita."
137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10331984-gillian,Rating 4 out of 5,"In this parallel story of two main protagonists, who find themselves unintentionally operating in a different world with a different plot from their ""regular"" lives, the chapters from different perceptions are amazing. In other words, the reader relives the plot from different viewpoints constantly. The love story between Tengo and Aomame just provides a framework for the meticulous and detailed plot and subplots revealed through their story. One of the main themes is how we create our own future, even to the extent of the novelist ending up inside his story.As thorough as this 1157 page book was, I thought every loose end would be tied up or untied(denouement), the word the author used for his ending, but I still have some questions after reading this. Either I didn't fully understand what the author was getting at with some of the seemingly ""unnecessary"" storylines or perhaps it is one of those books, where you may be thinking about it afterwards and possibilities will then dawn on you: A many layered master-piece."

139,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32433113-jonathan-k-max-outlier,Rating 4 out of 5,"Marukami is one of the few authors that masterfully bridges genre. Epic in length, he combines mystery, romance, fantasy and crime while using italics to illicit the character's 'thoughts'. As the multifaceted plot unfolds, we immerse in two separate worlds of mismatched characters who over the course of the story, connect. Haruki adds a spiritual/fantasy element which deepens the reader engagement while illuminating character's desires. I don't believe I've ever encountered a story quite like this one, though I'll admit I was disappointed by the ending. Regardless its pacing, genre blending and and prose are unique to the author making for a highly recommended book. "

143,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67951314-phrodrick,Rating 5 out of 5,"In 1Q84, Haruki Murakami has proved that a modern writer can tell a story with the best of any era or culture. Heaping superlatives on this book may make me sound like a shill. Too bad. Murakami has written the best fiction I have read in years.Within the first few chapters, the reader has enough information to know much about the plot and can make a fair guess how it will end. The only thing to keep the reader's attention is the author's craft. The details are all that matters for the 1157 pages in this edition.In the first chapter, it is Spring of 1984. We are introduced to Aomame our female protagonist. She will fall down a rabbit hole, technically climb down into it, and emerge in in what she will come to call 1Q84. In case you think this will be a children's story, she will have a mildly erotic memory as she descends. We have already been warned that ""not everything is as it seems."" Aomame is not as she seems.In the next chapter we will meet the male protagonist, Tengo. He is very much who he seems. However it will be his task to secretly ghost write a book. That is he will produce a major plot device that is not all that it seems.The structure of 1Q84 is alternating chapters about these two people. We will quickly learn of the long ago connection between them. Given this structure and this information it does not take a very alert reader to understand that these two will find each other. By chapter four we know the outcome and have ample information to guess at the broad outline of the plot. The only question is: can the writing keep us involved?Early in the book and continuing throughout we will be fed global cultural references. The most common being:American jazz and blue jeansEastern European Classical musicCentral European Philosophy and psychologyOne German made pistolFrench and British literatureLiquor and tobacco from several non-Japanese originsThe heart of the story is Japanese. The story-line is based in magical reality. We are asked to consider forces beyond good and evil. There are spirits, portents and ghosts. Among these forces it is never clear who is good or bad. The ultimate power seems to reside in maintaining balance. Even this word is left ambiguous. Forces are in opposition, but too much power on the one side causes something to happen that empowers the other. Over all this love is triumphant and we are reminded that there is a God.All of these themes are consistent with Japanese story telling. I have seen these same vague spirits in early Japanese movies and in modern Japanese Anime.Ultimately what sets 1Q84 above the various traditions and the predictable ending are the skills of the story teller. Murakami style is deceptively simple. Where you are given facts, they are rarely embellished or intricate. If you are not to be given facts, it is made clear that you are not intended to have an explanation. Some things are never fully explained. Pay attention. Characters will usually tell you pages in advance, what new disclosure is coming or what will never be explained.Murakami is also a master of pacing. Much of the early chapters are introductory, events proceed slowly. The middle third will see an increase in the action and increased tensions. The ending will occasionally lag then leap forward. All of this is deliberate. All of this is applied story telling.1Q84 can be read in relatively short bursts. There may be readers who could not put it down. I was not one. But, when I was not reading it, I was thinking about it. As certain as I was of the outcome I was worried about both the main characters and many of the second and third tier characters. Most of these characters at some point will engage your sympathies. No one is entirely good or evil.One can argue that great writers like Tolstoy wrote long novels, but they also handled large issues: war, crime, politics, and the depths of the human soul. 1Q84 is mostly about its characters. The major themes include the power of love and of believing. The discussion of being beyond good and evil will be the starting point for many advanced academic papers. What I most enjoyed, what I most happily road in was the craft of Haruki Murakami"
144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58035793-hiba,Rating 3 out of 5,"[2.5*]I have just finished the book and didn't want to let it sit with me before talking about it, and I'm not sure that's a good idea or not. Murakami was never a favorite author of mine, I never felt particularly drawn to his writing, and I can even say I feel somewhat repulsed by his ""style."" Nonetheless, when I saw a thousand pages beauty, I couldn't stop myself; thanks to my best friend, I got ahold of the book, and it was all I could do to hold myself from diving right through into it. But enough about me, a subjective review is in order.I will first start with book 1; it was a sort of introduction to the story, separated bits here and there. The first thing I noticed was how fast-paced the book is, albeit long. I did enjoy myself, but some particularities put me off. Murakami might not be misogynistic, and he probably only wanted to portray a 1984ish world faithfully. Still, I couldn't shake off the feeling of uncomfortableness some comments and passages generated in me. Similarly, there is also the issue of sexualizing women, which is something I have noticed in many Japanese writings (including manga). Here, the same thing was present plus sexualizing a 17yo. Call me oversensitive, but that's just how I see things. Coming to book 2, I began loosening up a bit and trying to enjoy the flow of the story more. I also came to the realization and acceptance of the fact that I would never, no matter how hard I try, fully grasp Murakami's books. When I accepted that, I came through this line that sums it perfectly: ""If you can't understand it without an explanation, you can't understand it with an explanation."" Once I resigned myself to this realization, I felt that I enjoyed this part of the story better. Perhaps it was because of the action going on, I'm not sure. Nonetheless (you knew this was coming) there were again elements that shouldn't have been there—for instance, presenting paedophilia and underage sex as some event drawing from fantasy, magical realism, and otherworldly stuff. Of course, these events weren't meant as underage sex, etc., but that's what they are. I would have preferred the author had chosen something else to represent these fabulous and unusual occurrences. Still, I didn't feel the magical element of the book; I didn't feel the spark (I know I'm being extra cliché today, but bear with me), I read on and on, not feeling anything.Book 3 was a nightmare; I started noticing recurrences in Murakami's style, how repetitive he is. Of course, when you're writing something this long, you probably should make sure your readers are still following the line of events, but Murakami did it overtly (so much for being subtle).The elements that were always there in writing were mainly comparisons and figures of speech. I don't mind comparing things to other things to make the description more vivid, but you can't keep throwing them all over the place, even to describe the making of a cup of coffee in the morning. The ending, however, was spectacular, I give Murakami that. It was heartwarming, and I even teared up a bit (blame the hopeless romantic in me).Overall, the book isn't spectacular; there are some quotable passages, some aesthetic elements, things that made me carry on reading day after day. It was fast-paced, so I didn't have to struggle through it for a month or so, but that was it. 1Q84 is not a book that would stay with me or one that I would recommend. It came into my life and didn't displace anything or put anything out of order; it left me exactly as it has found me.With this declare my rupture with Murakami, this was the last thread connecting me to his world, and I have put up so many hopes on it that it fell apart and disconnected me from wherever it is Murakami lives."
145,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin,Rating 4 out of 5,"The synopsis of this book tells us of people who find themselves in a world that is similar to but different from the ""real world"" of 1984. There is the obvious suggestion here from the title and year mentioned but don't let that mislead you. While there are a few undercurrents that might refer peripherally to ideas from Orwell's work the book is not dealing with the same type story.The only way I can describe this book is ""odd"" or ""different"". I suspect it will appeal greatly to some readers (and I can see why as the writing even in translation is often beautiful). Others will probably be totally put off by it. Could I give a 3.5 here I would. The book, it's story and the experience of reading it are good, but there are (for me) significant negatives. I'll not even try to give a synopsis here. Any including the cover blurbs would be and are imprecise and in some ways misleading. Also the book is (as I said) in some ways more of an experience than simply a read. I read other reviews and see that it took others far differently than it did me. For example one reviewer mentioned a sense of the eerie that seemed to be the major part of the book. This was not so for me.A great deal of the books atmosphere comes from the collision of the normal with the strange. For me the normality overwhelmed the strange a bit. For the protagonists the strange or eerie intrudes at different moments forcing them to confront that it's there only to leave them trying to fit back into the other normal or almost normal parts of life. These are people who get jerked into a world that is in many ways greatly different from the one they (and we) know while in other ways being indistinguishable. Be aware if it bothers you that there s a great deal of graphic sex in the book. I suspect we have a bit of cultural dissonance here. Speaking of the graphic scenes this book has more sex scenes that really aren't supposed to be about sex than any I've read. Sex and the sex act stand in for several things in the story. It works but I can see how it may bother some readers.While there are times the book seems to get very tedious and repetitive (there's one character we are told over and over is ugly. Not only that he is ugly but how he's ugly, how it has effected his life, his family's lives and so on. Thousands of words get devoted to it almost every time the character comes on the scene). Still while this is a problem it doesn't really ruin the book. I admit that by the time I got to the end I was ready for the book TO END, but still on the whole I liked it.With some reservations I recommend this. All I can say is try it for yourself and see if it's your cup of green tea. "

 3 of 5 stars-----
I'm going to start off with the things I didn't like about this book. I am all for the writing as it was easy to read and approachable but there are some parts that didn't sit with me well. The sexual narrative was cringey. I was wincing every single time Tengo described the 'swell of the breasts' of every woman he met. The intent was nothing sexually perversive than to simply describe the woman in front of him but still! Every time he was having a 'private time' with a woman, or even in Aomame's point of view while staring at her own body, it wouldn't be complete if there's no description of the 'pubic hair'. Every. Single. Time. He even found a way to mention pubic hair by describing Ushikawa's frizzy hair. And how can I place my trust to someone who used the word 'ejaculation' to describe the sexual release in every sexual encounter in the whole book, like dude you can describe it in different ways. And the word 'pumping'?! What the hell? His sexual narrative was unpleasant it weirded me out. I don't know if it was really Murakami's technique or it was just influenced by the translator but either way, it was kind of ridiculous. This book was also so unnecessary lengthy. Maybe the story was served best in a long book. I would definitely understand if it was 600 page long but more than a thousand page? I don't think it needed to be that long. And the problem alongside that was the fact that it was that long yet there are still a lot of things left unanswered. What happened to the other characters that were left hanging like Tengo's older girlfriend, Fuka-Eri, Tsubasa, Buzzcut and Ponytail, and even the six Little People that exited Ushikawa's mouth? What the hell happened to them? This book was as vague as it was lengthy. And I was not that happy to wait basically the whole book for Tengo and Aomame to finally meet. I even started to doubt if they were really going to meet. That being said, I still didn't have the desire to cut my reading off halfway. Despite those problems, I still found myself anticipating every chapter and I really did enjoy the whole time I was reading this. I specifically didn't consider the slow progress of the story as boring because it was what I liked about it the most. I can even considered this as the slowest build up of a story I've ever read. I didn't particularly regret reading this. I just wish it provided clear explanations and answers in exchange for the time I've invested reading this. This is not a great book but it was still good overall. Though it was definitely not for every kinds of readers out there but I still recommend it for those patient enough to overlook the length."
147,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12831990-jason,Rating 3 out of 5,"Murakami has a way of writing ethereally lonely accounts that twist and distort reality rather than wrenching it, he is a spell caster. 1Q84 is a perfect example of this intimate look at a world that has slipped, though perhaps this one slips a little further towards fantasy than his typical writing. We have 'little people', cocoons or 'chrysalises', a small green moon, and all kinds of other supernatural stirrings. More than anything though, I think we realize before the end that this is just a love story, a strange and meandering love story, a struggle against loneliness and hurt, and what is more normal than that?“I'm tired of living unable to love anyone. I don't have a single friend - not one. And, worst of all, I can't even love myself. Why is that? Why can't I love myself? It's because I can't love anyone else. A person learns how to love himself through the simple acts of loving and being loved by someone else. Do you understand what I am saying? A person who is incapable of loving another cannot properly love himself.”As long as this book was and as long as it took me to read it, I think I am going to keep this very short. Behind the slip from one world to another, beyond the small green moon, beneath the mysterious happenings and violence, what we have is a desperate search for human love, for The One that makes everything have meaning.“At my core, there is nothing. Neither is it parched wastelands. At my core, there is love. I'll go on loving that ten-year-old boy named Tengo forever --- his strength, his intelligence, his kindness. He does not exist here, with me, but flesh that does not exist will never die, and promises unmade are never broken.”Repetitions/Inspirations/Recommendations:- moon(s)- Janacek's Sinfonietta- Proust's In Search of Lost Time- Chekov"

It was so long (almost 1000 pages) and drawn out, and didn't really have much of a point. The self-indulgent author spent pages and pages describing the characters' daily lives in such minute detail, for absolutely no reason that I could tell. Did we really need to know every time they had a pee, what they ate for each meal, the fur on their tongues? And the ""Little People"" were never really explained - I still had no idea what they wanted by the end of the book and, if they were so much in control of so many people, how did they do that with such a small vocabulary? All they said was ""Ho Ho!"". Were they escaped elves from Santa's workshop? He obviously needs a new editor. In my opinion this book would have been much better if it was condensed into 200 pages (Or less. Or even better, NONE!!). The translation from Japanese was not natural or flowing, either. And the connection to George Orwell's 1984? Not there - no idea what the ""homage to George Orwell's 1984"" was supposed to be. George Orwell would probably have been mortified. I really do not recommend this book, I can't imagine who would enjoy it. I think the only people who gave it good reviews are pseudo-intellectuals who are pretending they ""got it"". The only reason I bothered to actually finish it was because I was so intrigued to find out whether the author actually had a point to make. He didn't. Definitely a case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes""!"

150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229019-liviu,Rating 5 out of 5,"I will have a full review soon; for now I will say that despite a little slowing down in the 3rd book (the original Japanese publication was in 3 volumes and the author actually wrote only the first two initially and then wrote #3 a year later and it shows a little as mentioned, with this last book less tight and with some filler), the book is close to genius and it will be most likely my #1 novel of the year and while i need some time to pass, I see it getting to my list of all time favorites too.Full FBC RvINTRODUCTION: ""The year is 1984 and the city is Tokyo. A young woman named Aomame follows a taxi driver’s enigmatic suggestion and begins to notice puzzling discrepancies in the world around her. She has entered, she realizes, a parallel existence, which she calls 1Q84 —“Q is for ‘question mark.’ A world that bears a question.” Meanwhile, an aspiring writer named Tengo takes on a suspect ghostwriting project. He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled.As Aomame’s and Tengo’s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell’s—1Q84 is Haruki Murakami’s most ambitious undertaking yet.""While I have owned pretty much all the major works of the famous contemporary Japanese author Haruki Murakami for some time now, I have to confess I only browsed several of them along the years, always with an ""I plan to read them some day"" thought. So when I read about 1Q84 and the considerable hype surrounding it, I thought, well I will take a look and maybe get it for later, but to my considerable surprise, once I opened the book I just could not put it down until I absolutely had to. Some 900+ pages later I have to say that for once hype (masterpiece, Nobel book, genius, etc) is utterly warranted.1Q84 has been translated by Jay Rubin (books 1 and 2) and Philip Gabriel (book 3).OVERVIEW/ANALYSIS: I will talk here about 1Q84 from a sff reader's perspective, while if you want a more ""mainstream"" discussion, you can check this NYT article. I am making this distinction because when reading 1Q84 I was struck by how much some elements mentioned in the above article - and in a few other similar places - as strange or outlandish seemed to me just regular sffnal stuff, as did a lot of the plot twists and turns, all quite typical of the better secondary world fantasies or space operas out there.Conversely, 1Q84 brings a very adult attitude to its main characters, attitude which is most of the time missing from sff which either shies away from the topic or goes to the other extreme essentially for shock's value.The content of 1Q84 is well summarized in the blurb above, so I will refer to it when discussing the structure and highlights next. The novel is divided into three books that each cover three months from 1984 starting in April, when Aomame starts her adventure in the parallel universe with two moons, magic and ""the little people"" that she calls 1Q84. In the other thread, former ""boy wonder"" Tengo, now living an obscure but fulfilling life as a math teacher at an elite school and aspiring novelist, is so compelled by the fantasy story in a manuscript written by a 17 year old girl, that he accepts a dodgy proposition from his editor and his adventure starts also.The first two books were published simultaneously in Japan and alternate chapters from Aomame and Tengo, each with a subheading that is both appropriate and subtle. These two books are very tightly woven and they twist, turn, amplify and scale down the story perfectly, while ending in a way that would have been maddening were not the third book available immediately.The last book that is both a prologue and an epilogue, introduces a third viewpoint which at first seems out of place, but it soon integrates well with Tengo and Aomame's. This third pov is crucial to the structure of this part as it provides both the back story and most of the narrative tension, while Tengo and Aomame take a detour so to speak.As noted above, while the story twists and turns a lot, the experienced sff reader will most likely figure it out well ahead of time with motifs like the destined ones, parallel universes and portals, magical links and prophecies, though here all happens in Tokyo 1984, so we have the mundane world of subways, cars, bars, news, a secretive cult etc. And it works perfectly, while the magic is slowly introduced, first in the ""fantasy novel"" of Fuka Eri that Tengo ghost rewrites into a masterpiece - though in a nice touch that should resonate, it is snubbed by the main Japanese literary prize as bestselling and genre - and later in revelation after revelation.Another thing I really appreciated about 1Q84 was that it kept away from the pitfalls of solipsism. Parallel universes, portals and the existence of those special few who know/use them always invite this immediate breaking of the suspension of disbelief by un-substantiating the ""real world"" but the author is clearly aware of this and discusses it quite a few times:""Komatsu considered this for a long time, wrinkles forming on either side of his nose. Finally he sighed and glanced around. “What a strange world. With each passing day, it’s getting harder to know how much is just hypothetical and how much is real. Tell me, Tengo, as a novelist, what is your definition of reality?”“When you prick a person with a needle, red blood comes out—that’s the real world,” Tengo replied.""The novel also keeps things ambiguous enough to allow us to speculate, while the ending adds one extra twist which for once I did not quite see and which deepened my appreciation of Haruki Murakami's genius.1Q84 contains so much that even enumerating things that are of note in the book would take quite a lot of space and while I think that the novel is one than can be read many times and still fully enjoyed, I will mention only the ""levitating clock"" that startled quite a few early (mainstream readers) as it marked in a way the clear dividing line where the novel fully moves into the sff-nal space so no one can deny it is a work of speculative fiction anymore, two moons or not...Overall 1Q84 (A++) is simply the best novel released in 2011 so far.

151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47417894-laura-noggle,Rating 5 out of 5,"A mission to get through, Murakami is a master of setting a scene and describing innate, minute character details and nuances. Still loved it, in all it's haunting, melancholy glory. A beautiful combination of parallel universes, mystery, and dealing with life alone, not always lonely. Of course, Murakami is highly quotable and this book is full of delicate visual lines. His inclusion of an excerpt from Chekhov's ""Sakhalin Island"" especially struck a chord with me, as I was living in Beijing when I read it:""Now there are not even traces left of those cabins, and, gazing round at the wilderness, the tall, beautiful female soldier seems like some kind of myth. They are building a new house here, for overseers' offices or possibly a weather center, and that is all. The roaring sea is cold and colorless in appearance, and the tall grey waves pound upon the sand, as if wishing to say in despair: ""Oh God, why did you create us?"" This is the Great, or, as it is otherwise known, the Pacific, Ocean. On this shore of the Naibuchi river the convicts can be heard rapping away with axes on the building work, while on the other, far distant, imagined shore, lies America ... to the left the capes of Sakhalin are visible in the midst, and to the right are more capes ... while all around there is not a single living soul, not a bird, not a fly, and it is beyond comprehension who the waves are roaring for, who listens to them at nights here, what they want, and, finally, who they would roar for when I was gone. There on the shore one is overcome not by connected, logical thoughts, but by reflections and reveries. It is a sinister sensation, and yet at the very same time you feel the desire to stand for ever looking at the monotonous movement of the waves and listening to their threatening roar.""*2021 Update*I read this at the perfect time in my life, and often think about the passage on the Pacific Ocean quoted above. I wonder how a reread would go, but part of me wants to hold on to the the perfect memory I have of the whole experience.It's been almost 10 years since I've read this book and I am still haunted by its beautiful ennui.

152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8913754-kru,Rating 5 out of 5,"Reading Murakami is the most lovable thing to do. It is a laid back affair, events move musically, reading feels like a dance in trance heart swaying to the rhythm, and unlike my normal self I don’t bother about time or the ending. This is one reason I have reservations over picking his book, like it's a sinful indulgence.Coming to 1Q84, I found this different from his other books, the proceedings were fast, too fast in fact. Chapters alternate between Tengo and Aomame in the first 2 books, Ushikawa adds his part to the third book. There are repetitions, probably because of the serialization, as a recap to strongly emphasize certain facts, that said there were also times the flow felt stagnant. Tamaru was the character I loved the most, Ushikawa's chapters were the ones I wished ended fast. Some knots remain unsolved and I have no qualms about it, in fact that is how I loved it.The central plot is a love story with a mystical theme, an ode to Orwell's classic 1984, but it is rich with insights into some wonderful works of art, literature and personalities like Orwell, Hemingway, Chekov and Proust. These anecdotes enrich the reading experience, typical of Murakami. I strongly feel Murakami's references to the Masters have a tinge of unparalleled reverence.The weirdness quotient was a bit high and there were times when I couldn’t control my laughter, also times when I just wanted to drop the book and go look at the moon wondering whether time really moves in a straight line. The love of Aomame and Tengo started at zero in my mind and slowly but steadily grew into a very intense one, and magically made me feel satiated and heave a sigh at the end, dissolving all the doubts and adverse thoughts that were looming large, converting them to 5 stars."

I knew you are still waiting for me My pale moon ..Because without your love, it's a honky-tonk paradeIt’s only a paper-moon.Murakami never fails to astonish me!. In this lengthy trilogy he went through two different worlds .. the normal 1984 & its counterpart 1Q84 or the cat town, where there are two moons, Air chrysalis, the Little People and a boy & a girl who separated for 20 years and now was the time for them to meet again..It all started with a small community that went from a peaceful purpose to a world like George Orwell’s 1984 depicted world .. thought control .. thought crime .. no justification was given regarding the transformation that happened to the professor who became its Leader or how it became a sort of a religion to such a highly educated person, what are those voices and what they were telling them to do? All that was left ambiguous as expected from Murakami .. Then after all those basic facts were illustrated, the impossible love story has been continued .. In a world with two moons! I personally have loved the novel, but it was too lengthy ..half of it was almost repeated, re-told by several characters ..I prefer it was shorter, still Murakami at his best!

Même pas pour la réappropriation de l'univers orwellien, ou pour la magie des petits êtres vivant dans des chèvres mortes. C'est plutôt pour le traitement de la solitude. Chez Murakami, tout le monde est si seul, et vit tellement bien sa solitude. Cette manière d'évoluer dans le monde des personnages, comme si l'agitation tout autour d'eux leur était étranger, cette attention aux détails les plus infimes de leur existence - leur nourriture, leurs habitudes - me touche, car elle nous représente tous. Au-delà de cela, 1Q84 est un monument littéraire, une incroyable prouesse technique. Je ne regrette que la fin, peut-être un peu hâtive."

But it's beautiful in its own way, and a weird medley of his works. In this, I saw a little bit of Kafka, Wind-Up Bird, Sputnik, Wild Sheep Chase, After Dark, AND Norwegian Wood.

159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65522073-trisha,Rating 2 out of 5,"I hate to say that despite my better judgement, I decided to read this book and how much I regretted the experience throughout. The book started off okay with bringing in a woman assassin who has taken onto herself to kill men who abuse their wives. Aomame is a fitness instructor and a personal trainer to high profile clients. Sounded sort of fair to me till that point. Then we are introduced to the male protagonist, Tengo, who is unusually good at everything he does - from academics to music to even literature(okay, maybe not that good at literature because it is emphasised that he is an unpublished author) but in any case, this man is god gifted. And then comes the connection between them. Both the protagonists, now thirty years old, had held hands twenty years ago in a classroom at their elementary school and have been in love ever since that moment. Despite having moved on to different paths, they still miss the touch of each other’s hands and are transported to that moment time and again. So the purpose of the novel is to reunite the lovers and give them the happy ending they deserve. Easy! But what would Murakami’s works be without some fantasy?Here comes the highlight of the novel - a parallel world, just as same as the regular world with the only difference in the number of moons. So this alternate/parallel world has two moons. If you’re expecting to know why the other world has two moons, don’t wait for it, because there is no answer. Or probably the answer is to differentiate between the worlds, that’s it! Aomame is transported to this parallel world with the two moons after taking an emergency exit stairway which acted as a portal to the other world, which she names 1Q84 ( and Murakami had to write a few pages to defend the title and bring out the comparison between Orwell’s 1984 in case the reader misses the point because obviously, the reader would never be able to see the similarity by himself/herself since there is NO similarity). We are told Aomame is pulled into 1Q84 because Tengo has ghostwritten a novel about this world, however, Tengo himself gets pulled into 1Q84 pretty late, without taking the emergency exit stairway, so we never get to know how he comes into this bizarre world of 1Q84.Fuka-Eri is the original author of the novel Tengo decides to ghostwrite. She is a seventeen year old girl of very few words and feelings owing to having had a bizarre experience when she was young with something called ‘The Little People’. Who are these little people, you’ll never get to know. Are they good or bad, no answer! They create Fuka-Eri’s Dohta, so that her father could have sex with the Dohta and hear the VOICE. Add to this a lot of sexually explicit details about how Aomame’s breasts look, how their sizes vary, how Fuka-Eri has ample breasts, a freshly made vagina and no pubic hair, how everyone’s breasts are - Tengo’s girlfriend, the nurses at Tengo’s father’s sanatorium and keep repeating this information until you remember this by heart. Also add grotesque information about both heterosexual and homosexual encounters in the book and sexual abuse of underage girls. Murakami goes on to horrendously describe women’s bodies to the very last detail with hardly a reference or two to men’s bodies. Objectifying women is obviously easy!This novel is undeservingly lengthy and full of loose ends. Murakami introduces a number of interesting bits but does not care to tie them together in the end. Readers are left with questions like - Who were the little people? How was Aomame impregnated? What happened to Fuka-Eri and Tengo’s older girlfriend? Was Fuka-Eri actually a Dohta? What was the voice that the Leader heard? What was with the cab driver - how did he know that Aomame was entering a different world? And most importantly, once Aomame and Tengo take the stairway back up to 1984, what happens to 1Q84? Murakami has left more questions after Book 3 than he had left at the end of Book 1. I know we shouldn’t read Murakami’s works for logic, but the magic he weaves in his other books is missing in this one. The book is too repetitive and downright creepy.Having said the above, I did like a few things - the concept of an alternative reality (even though the justification was missing), the logical character sketch of Ushikawa (until obviously he starts noticing Fuka-Eri’s ample breasts), the Dohta-Maza concept which is like creating doppelgängers of an individual, the wanderings of Tengo’s father’s soul, collecting fees, like an astral projection (however this again is not explained or justified) and lastly, the references to some beautiful music (which exists as a playlist on Spotify, thanks to a friend for bringing this to our reading group’s attention).🌟 🌟 from my end. Not recommended to anyone, unless you are a diehard fan of Murakami and are ready to read anything from him."

I don't know, maybe that would have helped. I know that most people greatly enjoyed this book, with some of my friends marking it as a favorite, but it just didn't work that great for me. I liked the characters, the storyline, the writing style--it was just too long. And this is coming from someone for whom the sight of a chunkster is like a siren's song.The first half of the book, I was captivated. The plot was moving slowly but steadily forward. Each chapter ended in a mini-cliffhanger, and I was enjoying getting to know Aomame and Tengo at this slow pace. Gradually, though, the pace slowed even more, until it was non-existent. Suddenly, we had all of the main characters--ALL--holed up in individual hiding places. Fuka-Eri is hiding in Tengo's apartment ALONE. Aomame is hiding in a safe house apartment ALONE. Tengo is in a different town, spending every day at the bedside of his comatose father, ALONE (except for the nurses). There were pages and pages of this, with the characters doing nothing. Oh, yeah, except they were doing something--they were reflecting on the stuff that had already happened and that we had already been over many, many times. I realize that a book has lost me when I stop wondering what happens next and just wonder what happens at the end. That's my signal that I am completely bored with what is happening now and just want it to be over. My personal principles do not allow me to flip to the last page, read it, and be done with it. Would that I could! When I did read through some reviews last night, I could completely identify with the ones (and there were several) that spoke of their intense desire to ""just finish it!"" I did like the story--I did. That liking, that investment, was marred and buried beneath the ever-growing boredom brought on by the almost complete inactivity of the second half. Again, I LOVE big books. It just makes me sad that he had all that room, all those pages, all those words--and he chose to do so little with them. Most of my favorite books are behemoths like this one, and many are universally admired. When I go back and try to sum up those stories, even the summary is long and detailed because SO MUCH HAPPENED. I could sum up this story in a paragraph. It would be an interesting paragraph, but still just a paragraph.I fully intend to read more of Murakami's work. I do believe he is a talented writer. Hopefully, I will have a different reaction to his other works. This is just my opinion, and I'm well aware that I'm in the minority. If you're reading this before reading the book, do not let this deter you. The odds are in your favor!"
161,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1623821-ed-raso,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'll preface this review by saying I have not read a lot of Murakami. I'm really only comparing this book to The Wind Up Bird Chronicle while keeping in mind the opinions of a lot of friends (all very good readers, mind you) who have.1Q84 seems to me like Murakami's ""radio single"". I mean this in a good way. I'm not, by any means, saying that he sold out to make this book accessible. He didn't. It's Murakami, through and through: a koanish, surreal fantasy filled with classical music, food preparation, cats, and complex, well-drawn characters.So it's difficult for me to put my finger on exactly why I feel this book is more mainstream than his previous works. One might point out it's because 1Q84 is extremely readable. Yet Murakami has never been difficult. Perhaps it's because it is, at heart, a love story. But that's really nothing new either.I think it's because *************BEGIN MAJOR SPOILER************in the end, everything works out perfectly for the two protagonists. After the 900 page romantic build up, we get finally to see Tengo and Aomame reunited, under a single moon, eluding the bad guys. They're going to start a family.*************END MAJOR SPOILER*************I gave this book 4 stars because of its ability to satisfy my mainstream sweet-tooth and also my literary tastes, but mostly because the characters have stayed with me and I was sorry to see them go.But there are, of course, some points of contention. For instance, how did Air Chrysalis go from a short story in a new author's contest to be the length of a novel? I know it was rewritten, but it's a stretch to think Tengo expounded upon the story that much, especially considering how it was repeated over and over and over how true to the original he stayed. It doesn't make sense. This is the most glaring, but there were several other head-scratchers, several involving the head of Sakigake.Also, the length. Even with the book's readability, it didn't need to be 900 pages. It meandered a bit in places and started to drag at points. Reading it was a little like watching a director's cut. Perhaps it was a case of an editor frightened of being too heavy-handed with a work by one of the masters.And Murakami is definitely that. Still."

And just like 'Wind-up Bird"" where we were also left holding pat, waiting for the wizard reveal of what was the to-do's with that book's nagging points, again left unanswered, which would be ok if they were'nt built up to frenzy plot paticulars. Murakami outdid himself ploting and creating this fantastical tale but is all too cutely fitted and miraculously played out. There is no there there. In ""Wind-up Bird"" there was a deep, dark, dry well for contemplation, in 1Q84 it's a cold and dark schoolyard slide that serves as focal scene. There's the lithe young girls in both with mystical sight and nubile breasts constantly poking into view. And love gone wrong searching for right. Still & all I liked it 'cause he opened some cool readers' doors to readerly things like imaginary worlds lurking at hand right here everywhere.""It's a Barnum and Baily world, Just as phony as it can be,But it wouldn't be make-believe If you believed in me."" ---------------- that's *You* HM, right?"

After the Quake is a collection of short stories, while 1Q84 is a punishingly long novel. There is a plot line that comes and goes a few times involving child sexual abuse. The way it was described and fit into the plot was in poor taste. If you’ve read it you may have a different opinion, but that’s just how it came across to me.The female characters were flat. The point of them often seemed just to titillate his (predominantly male) readers with how they were sexualized.And it was too damn long. Jeez it was long. And despite the length, most of the key mysteries introduced were never resolved.I do have to say I was quite absorbed in the story though. I did make it through the book after all. There was a part in the book where a character relates a short story called “Town of Cats”. I loved the “Town of Cats” story and think about it often. It is such beautiful storytelling and is Murakami at his best. So as frustrating as this book was, I still want to give Murakami another shot. Norwegian Wood seems to have better reviews, I think I’ll try that one next."

In the book, Tengo is one of two main characters who pass between two distinct worlds, one of which has supernatural elements. But this story deals mainly with the real world —and the relationship between a boy and the man who raises him. Was this portrait of Tengo’s background —the disappearance of his mother, the difficult relationship with his father— part of your conception of the book and the character from the beginning.Read hereOpening: At Koenji Station, Tengo boarded the Chuo Line inbound rapid-service train. The car was empty. He had nothing planned that day. Wherever he went and whatever he did (or didn’t do) was entirely up to him.

I am not a person who reads chick lit or vampire novels. I consider myself eclectic in my reading and for the most part I read things that are a bit of a challenge. That being said, I hated every single minute of reading this book. It was like reading a college textbook. It could have gotten its point across in half the number of pages. I feel that Mr. Murakami was so busy being pretentious and trying to ""get you"" with his twists and turns that he filled this book with redundancy The premise was interesting but not enough to keep you involved for almost 1,000 pages. It took so long for the reader to actually find out what Air Chrysallis (sp?) was about. I only found two characters who were sympathetic- Tengo and the bodyguard (name escapes me at the moment.)So I guess I am deep in the minority and a lot of people are amazed that I did not rave for this masterpiece. So be it."

The journey was well worth the time spent, I still think about the characters and find myself contemplating their fates in a meditative manner in quiet moments. This is definitely an “outside the box” read, and deserves its being touted as the author’s masterpiece. It is not for everyone, it is a book that requires a calm persistence and a willingness to just go with the narrative without expectations. One needs to make space for this book in one’s life. I was recovering from a bad accident and was a year into recovering from serious physical trauma. I spent a lot of time on my own in a limited venue and this book was a good companion. I passed it on to my son, he also appreciated it. Very highly recommended to the patient and discerning reader open to a pilgrimage with Murakami. "
167,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,Rating 4 out of 5,"Two years ago my friend Vivike gave me 
Kafka on the Shore
 for Christmas, assuring me that I would like it—and she was right. I also found it confusing and daunting and knew that, in Haruki Murakami, I had found yet another author whose works I will continue to digest long after I devour them with all the tenacity my love of reading requires. So for this Christmas as I considered which book to inflict upon Viv, Murakami’s latest was a natural choice. And I prefer to give people books that I have already read, so that my recommendation is all that more genuine. Of course, when I went to buy 1Q84 last Thursday, I didn’t quite realize it was 925 pages. Since I planned to give it to Vivike when I saw her on Monday, I had an intense few days of reading to do. But I made it!I liked 1Q84 better than Kafka on the Shore almost immediately. It might be owing to the more overtly science-fictional premise, this idea that Aomame might just have slipped into a parallel world. It might be that the mystery in this novel develops at a much less sedate pace than its impressive length suggests. It could be that, unlike the somewhat unequal relationship between Kafka on the Shore’s two main characters, Aomame and Tengo are a much more evenly-matched duo. Watching their stories converge, seeing the foreshadowing that Murakami uses, is one of the most delightful things about this book. I kept developing—then discarding—various theories as to what was going on. There were moments when I was so sure of an answer, only for Murakami to pull the carpet out from beneath my feet a hundred or two hundred pages later. Yeah, occasionally I was right—but who am I to keep score?1Q84 is a mystery and also a little bit of a fairy tale. Aomame is the investigator, and she is also an Alice in a Wonderland that is uncomfortably similar to her own world. Quickly it becomes apparent that the cult at Sakigake, the Little People, and Air Chrysalis all have something to do with Aomame’s sudden transition to this alternative worldline—but what, precisely, is the connection? Meanwhile, Tengo struggles with the ethics of his role as the ghostwriter of Air Chrysalis; he has also begun to wonder how the novel relates to Fuka-Eri’s real experiences at Sakigake. It’s a rich and multi-layered mystery. Wanting to know the answers was definitely one reason I kept reading (aside from my self-imposed deadline!). But the style and substance in which Murakami steeps his mystery makes the experience all the more enjoyable.1Q84 reminds me of 
Bridge of Birds
 in the way that many of its characters are less like actual people than they are like characters from a myth or a fable. (Alice in Wonderland has a similar quality to it.) The Leader, Professor Ebisuno, the Dowager, and even Fuka-Eri all have an advisory aspect to their personae. Even their names (Ebisuno is commonly addressed as “the Professor”, and while we do learn the dowager’s name late in the book, no one ever calls her by it) suggest the roles they play rather than people. The effect of this characterization is two-fold. Firstly, it supports the Jungian archetypes that Murakami explicitly employs throughout the novel. Secondly, it emphasizes the almost meta-fictional nature of the book—I say almost because 1Q84 never quite reaches the point where I would call it meta-fiction, but it comes very close. As novels that feature novelists as characters often are, it is a novel that is very keen to discuss and allude to various aspects of the conversation around literature.And like Bridge of Birds, 1Q84 has a happy ending because it has something to say about the nature of happiness. Both Aomame and Tengo have solitary lifestyles that they believe have made them happy, so they must confront whether this happiness to real or merely a wishful delusion (and if it is the latter, does that matter as long as it feels real?). Aomame finds herself making a friend just as she learns her next assassination will result in her going underground and changing her face and name. The death of Tengo’s father, and his mounting foreboding over his relationship to Fuka-Eri and the Little People, make Tengo realize that he is not really close to anyone and that he has no one on whom he can rely. As someone who has few close friends and leads a sparse social life with an emphasis on solitude accompanied by tea and a good book, I appreciated seeing this nuanced and complex take on such lifestyles. Murakami doesn’t draw conclusions so much as present possibilities.One person noted on my review of Kafka on the Shore that “the best authors (and I include Murakami here) do not set out to write a novel within the boundaries of a particular genre”. I would tend to agree, and 1Q84 is an excellent example where this appears to be the case. This novel flirts with so many genres but ultimately transcends them all. Much like China Miéville, Murakami seems very comfortable taking complete ownership of his story. He very clearly has influences (1984 being only the most obvious one, and perhaps the least significant). Yet like Miéville he seems less concerned with genre than with setting and character, as he should be. Yet Miéville and Murakami approach worldbuilding in totally different ways. Miéville is like the medieval artist who would sea serpents into the corners of maps: he describes his wonderful and terrifying new worlds to us with a level of detail that makes them come alive. Murakami, in contrast, is more minimalist, allowing the reader to build up a world through a relationship with the characters who traverse it. Aside from what Aomame learns, we don’t really know how 1Q84 differs from 1984—and it isn’t all that important. Although these two approaches are different, they achieve the same end: a work of fantasy that is not mired in the medieval tropes embraced by those who seek to emulate Tolkien and Vance. Both are extremely creative and talented authors with original voices.Maybe it’s because I’m slightly more familiar with the theories of Jung than those of Hegel or Kafka that I preferred 1Q84 over Kafka on the Shore. That said, familiarity with Jung is certainly not a prerequisite to understanding or enjoying this book. There’s room to interpret 1Q84 through the lens of the Shadow and the Magus, but there are many additional layers of meaning. You will notice that this review focuses on the literary qualities of 1Q84 almost to the exclusion of other concerns. That’s just my particular hang-up, and I hope you won’t come away with the impression that this is a book only book-lovers can love.There are so many other topics that 1Q84 covers. In general it’s a fascinating window into Japanese culture back in 1984. It deals with issues of abuse, of both women and children, and does not shy away from the ugly truths around this subject. It addresses the fine line between religion and cultism. Also, it’s an interesting example of a novel that wouldn’t work the same if it were set after the advent of the Internet. Murakami refers to computers a few times in the novel—Tengo notably buys a dedicated word processor—but I get the sense that if the novel were set in, say, the 2000s, its tone would be completely altered. The march of digital technology has changed us in ways that we don’t necessarily perceive until we read fiction written now about then.I can’t quite bring myself to give this book five stars. Unlike some people I’m not going to criticize it for its length, and I was pretty satisfied with the pacing. However, some parts of the book did feel repetitive (and perhaps this was because the three books were published as separate volumes in Japan). For example, I’m not convinced that Ushikawa as a character adds enough dimension to the story to merit his own chapters. (Yet Murakami chose to introduce a third character to the existing duet, altering the structure of the narrative rather significantly, so there must be more to it.) Combined with the extremely compressed time frame over which I read it, this repetition meant that there were moments when I wished Murakami would just get on with it. For each of those moments, however, there was definitely another moment when I was so invested in this story, so completely sold on its premise and determined to find out what would happen. Without a doubt, 1Q84 is a novel expansive in its philosophical and literary scope in a way that does not sacrifice the true core of any tale of fiction: the story. This is the second Murakami novel I’ve read, and it’s even more enticing than the first. With his careful eye for detail and for balance, Murakami is a first-class writer—and as always, kudos to the translators as well, for their dedication is responsible for helping Murakami’s voice cross the gap between our languages.

168,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1457001-stephen-durrant,Rating 5 out of 5,"Opinions on this lengthy trilogy (1318 pages in my Vintage paperback edition) vary widely. Reviews have ranged from the dithyrambic (e.g., Richard Lord Perry in The Times) to the dismissive (e.g., Allen Barras in The Atlantic). Even among those of us who post comments here on Goodreads, there is a tendency towards a rating of either five stars or one. So, what are the problems? First, Murakami is extremely popular, especially among the young. Here in France, for example, 1Q84 has sold a rather amazing 400,000 copies, which is most unusual for a book in translation. Let's face it: for some reviewers popularity, particularly among the young, invites suspicion. Moreover, it is easy to criticize Murakami's many references to both pop and high culture (from Harold Arlen's ""Say it's only a paper moon"" to Janacek's ""Sinfonietta,"" among many, many others in this case) and his obvious intertextuality (Orwell's 1984 and Carroll's Alice in Wonderland two obvious examples) as pandering to readers, particularly in the West, who want to minimize the cultural distance between themselves and a writer from Asia. Second, it is hard to classify Murakami's novels. Some call them ""Science Fiction,"" although I don't think that label quite applies, nor are they precisely ""fantasy"" or even ""surrealism."" Charles Baxter, writing in NYRB, has labelled Murakami's work ""unrealism,"" a category in which he also places Jonathan Lethem's Chronic City. A woman goes down a flight of stairs attached to a Tokyo freeway and is suddenly in a world of two moons, an NHK subscription collector lies in a coma and yet his spirit continues to circulate and threaten those who have not yet paid their bill, and on and on. Murakami rarely explains such oddities with pseudo-science or anything else--they just happen, and he nests these ""unrealities"" in a world that is generally realistic. Third, Murakami's prose, insofar as I can judge from the English translation, can range from the highly lyrical to the downright clunky. Any reviewer can readily identify plenty of cases of good or bad writing in this very long narrative, and in his other novels as well. Finally, while Murakami knows how to keep a reader engaged, so that even many who say they hated this novel admit to have continued reading, his plots become so dispersed that they can't quite reach an entirely convincing ending. In 1Q84, for example, the reader can be so attracted by the trajectory of the Aomame-Tengo relationship, that s/he forgets how quickly all those ""nasty"" antagonists seem to have evaporated. But, and this may be a ""but"" too large for some, the problems I have listed above derive, at least in part, from Murakami's startling creativity--he simply confounds so many of our categories and expectations. He is one of the writers (Margaret Atwood may be another) who continues to stretch the boundaries of that still very-much-alive genre we call ""the novel."" Moreover, he makes us rethink our own personal boundaries and categories. Two brief examples of the latter: his treatment of romance/sex and the question of politics.  	A number of reviewers find it ludicrous that a short moment in the lives of two ten-year-olds could lead to intense feelings of loss and longing extending over twenty years of separation. Frankly, I grieve a bit for those with insufficient romantic imagination to accept this possibility. Is this kind of thing really so rare? What I find striking, as have others, is that this lyrical romanticism exists alongside a rather cold, amoral, sometimes violent portrayal of sexuality. After all, one of the romantic two-some who looks back so fondly on a moment of childhood handholding, is a serial killer and enjoys lurid, anonymous sexual encounters with balding men! A good label for this vision might be ""romantic nihilism,"" and one finds it in other writers such as the controversial French novelist Michel Houellebecq. 	I cannot avoid the suspicion that this trilogy of over 1300 pages (Vintage paperback edition) was in part intended to strengthen Murakami's case for the Nobel Prize many readers in Japan and elsewhere think he deserves. I suspect the Prize will ever be his unless the selection committee changes drastically in the years ahead. And this brings us to the issue of politics. Recent Nobel-Prize winning novelists have had very strong and quite obvious political agendas directed for the most part against authoritarian states: Herta Müller, Mario Vargas Llosa, Mo Yan, etc. Murakami's political vision, if one can even call it such, is less overt than these recent winners and is not directed at those political centers we usually associate with authoritarianism. This may seem strange in the case of 1Q84, which plays off Orwell's masterful condemnation of totalitarian control. But Murakami seems to suggest that the threat may no longer be 1984's Big Brother but 1Q84's Little People. That is, the current danger comes from little people and their religious cults, zealous adherents, and deeply anti-social behavior. Armed with poison gas, as in the Tokyo sarin gas incident, or with a dirty nuclear bomb, a threat that will continue to hang over our heads for the foreseeable future, even the seemingly inconsequential group of fanatics can do enormous damage. 	Murakami's creative vision will continue to draw praise from some and fire from others. He challenges, provokes, and sometimes maddens us. His is a strange and sometimes strong cup of tea that will never suit everyone's taste. Personally, I look forward to future works and hope one day the Prize he probably will never win will actually be his. "

But totally worth it. You'll just have to read it to appreciate how intricate and entertaining the read is. You should probably read it as an ebook, though you might not enjoy the quirky features of the paper version:* okay, really high quality paper that was a pleasure to page-turn (no, really, it's noticeable!)* ""1Q84"" shows up in the center of each margin, though on the right-hand pages, the characters are reversed, as in a mirror.* the page numbers move up and down on the pages, like see-saws (if the number is high on the left. then it'll be low on the right).* whichever page number is below the '1Q84' is written in reverse, so this alternates between the left side and right side every 20 pages or so.* the rice-paper-like dust jacket and cover is a pretty cool effect too.But just check these out at a bookstore and you should be set. (UPDATE: don't fall into the publisher's schemes to prevent--futile--or delay the adoption of ereading: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/boo...)The key here for me were the plots. A few things you had to just accept, or suspend disbelief, or just hope that in the end they'll make sense, and in most cases this works. The different narratives weave together and just as described in the novel, they start getting closer together, swirling faster and faster as in a whirlpool. This made the reading get more and more intense as the novel progressed. Very satisfying. :)I was reminded of something my friend, David, said which is that often Asian literature is without good or evil, even if bad things happen to good people (and vice versa). I think that applies here as well.Healthy dose of supernatural (er, call it magical realism?) and matter-of-fact sexual situations as well, so felt very Murakami (wait, can I say that after only having read one before?).I made the mistake of reading Murakami, then David Mitchell's number9dream and back to Murakami in about a month's time, so the two authors are now quite conflated in my mind.One tidbit I got from the The Economist review: kyu is 9 in Japanese, so this is cleverer of a title than the explanation that Aomame named it 1Q84 with Q just representing 'question'.The only criticisms I have are minor:* he seems to think that the moon is only out at night. or possibly in this novel the moon is locked in orbit around the earth? but i know he mentions a 3/4 moon and 2/3 full moon, so it should be going through its usual phases* the novel is so long i think he felt compelled to do some recapping at times. too bad, though made it feel more like a serial, which might've been a fun way to read this because of the chapter structure.* in the third book, toward the end, he started to stray a bit from the third-person limited omniscient voice a bit. he started referring to things that only a reader of the novel could know or care or put together (though we could certainly do that for ourselves)...filling us in on the fact that certain events had taken place (in previous chapters) that the current chapter's characters didn't know about. this was unnecessary (he fills in plenty of detail so we should know what is being revealed already) and broke the 'rules' of his narrative. i think this was done because sometimes the events in different chapters were happening concurrently, sometimes in slightly reverse order and so forth, so the exact timing wasn't totally clear. this became more critical in the later chapters as the narratives rapidly spiraled toward one another in a whirlpool.There were a few typo bugs that I may get to later."

They choose the perfect exercises of the great masters. Or what amounts to the same thing: they want to watch the great masters spar, but they have no interest in real combat, when the great masters struggle against that something, that something that terrifies us all, that something that cows us and spurs us on, amid blood and mortal wounds and stench.By contrast, Murakami's 1Q84 reminds me of a youtube video I once watched of a bare-knuckle champion who goes up against a professional boxer. Despite the blood and the wounds, the fight—hopelessly mismatched from the start—contains none of what you might call ""real combat.""Murakami also proves ill-suited to the task at hand: in this case, the writing of a 1000-page-long novel. In a shorter work, his favoured literary devices—cartoonish characters, whimsical storylines, obscure pop-culture references—can come across as enigmatic and endearing. Yet in 1Q84, they only serve to exasperate the reader.Here, let's devote another paragraph to describing the precise composition of the lead character's outfit! Here, let's add another verbatim synopsis of a major plot point, just in case you missed it the first three times!Perhaps there's a half-decent novel lurking at the heart of 1Q84, one that clocks in at 300 pages tops. But as it stands, if the novel represents a struggle, it isn't one between the author and the terrifying unknown. No, the struggle exists between the reader and a mountain of middling prose."

Porque saben que la juventud vende.En esta historia el veterano editor Yūji Komatsu le propone a Tengo Kawana, un autor inédito pero de buena pluma, que reescriba en su totalidad ""La crisálida de aire"", novela hecha por una joven de 17 años llamada Eriko Fukada. Tengo cobra muy bien dicho encargo, pero antes firma una cláusula de confidencialidad donde renuncia a cualquier derecho como autor del libro. Gracias al halo de misterio que rodea a la chica, a la agresiva campaña de promoción, y a la reescritura secreta hecha por Tengo, el libro se convierte en un éxito de ventas. Por cierto, mi personaje favorito no es ninguno de estos protagonistas, sino el abogado horrible con la cabeza deforme. Me resultó enternecedor.No soy fan de la acción en los libros, por ello no me gustó mucho el rol de la justiciera, onda Kill Bill, ni el secuestro del editor, tipo Hollywood (llevado a cabo con cloroformo, ni más ni menos). Lo entiendo, este tipo de obras ambiciosas siempre tienen sus fallas, pero es su manera de apuntar a las estrellas —a las dos lunas, mejor dicho— lo que me seduce y me atrapa al final. Si quieren pasar un buen rato y, al mismo tiempo, darse una idea de cómo funciona el mundo editorial, dense un paseo por las páginas de 1Q84. Como siempre digo, me asombra cómo hay cuentos cortitos que me cuesta mucho leer, y luego están estas historias gigantes que se beben como cerveza espumosa en un día caluroso de verano.Le doy 4.75 estrellitas que suben a cinco porque soy reseñista barco."
173,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2580971-smiley,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsThis lengthy, trilogy-like novel by Haruki Murakami is all right if you don't mind reading surrealist episodes focused alternatively on Aomame and Tengo, chapter by chapter. As for me, I read his ""Kafka on the Shore"" some years ago and liked it since I could follow the boy protagonist along the story, there are of course mysterious events/scenes/characters he has to encounter but I could appreciate good themes, the boy's unique character as well as his sense of humour. However, I kept reading his latest novel and sometime found myself stunned due to some unthinkable plots, for instance, the way Aomame has conceived by means of, say, her mind. I thought this might be one of the consequences as imagined from the title itself, that is, 1Q84 while the whole story took place in 1984. This may of course suggest Orwellian on which the novel's theme based, I mean how to put a Q instead of the number 9 in the year and somewhere 'Big Brother' is sometime mentioned.Some descriptions related to romance or homicide, I think, are unnecessarily explicit. I don't see how such scenes are Orwellian at all and I don't see how they have typified the seemingly mysterious '1Q84' in any sense. One of the good points is that we need to keep alert while reading due to different font sizes, Murakami keeps using sentences/passages in italics so that, I think, they represent what that particular character is thinking, a good idea if they are not too long."

175,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27137459-ash,Rating 4 out of 5,"Reading Murakami is like taking part of a quest. You start reading, blend with the story, put forward your guesses, scribble on pages, check if you were right or wrong. You might be right, or wrong and the excitement is equal. For me, Murakami has been all about journey. The path he takes his reader is surreal and intriguing. My conscience always has a huge fight while reading. I keep on questioning why he writes things he write or why is it necessary or what does it even mean. All the fights but in the end, I can't help but admire the way I've walked and ran with his words.1q84 is a strange book and it's my first longest book ever. Among the three parts, the first two were interesting. But, the third part sounded repetitive. I feel sometimes Murakami goes into a reflection that sounds too monotonous and formulaic. Maybe some parts could've been just edited off, couple of hundred pages just scraped off. Nonetheless, a journey to remember, as always. ""It's a Barnum and Bailey world"" afterall."

The title comes from a story our narrator, Tengo, reads while on a train, and it adds a nice touch of magical realism to an otherwise grounded piece. I most enjoyed the ambiguity Tengo faces in terms of his mother's disappearance and his father's dementia. Murakami writes Tengo's dilemma in a bittersweet and sympathetic way while maintaining the maturity and sophistication of his piece as a whole.Overall, recommended to Murakami fans and those who enjoy magical realism and/or family tension in their short stories. Not sure when I will find time to read 1Q84, but I look forward to it nonetheless. "

It ranges from terrible dialogue to the worst pacing I have ever experienced in a maximalist effort, to not only really bad characterization—especially in regards to women, which Murakami simply cannot write—but every character is inactive, many are as superfluous as much of the actual text. It does manage to produce an interesting conceit by the end, then the conceit ironically all but invalidates the entirety of the fiction. There are no interesting ideas being explored, there is no definitive answers, nor would they matter. The conceit itself isn’t explained satisfactorily and neither is there a point being made. It is quite literally a pointless, aimless work that attempts to garner satisfaction from the reader by way of innocuous gotcha moments that stack up to say something like, maybe, if you have love, you can escape the darkness we ourselves create in our internal worlds. Except that may not be true either, since there are many doubts as to what the actual outcome is. The conceit also handwaves the many problematic elements of the fiction and as such feels like an adolescent indulgence in pointless sex, assault on minors, and other trauma. This feels like a pattern with Murakami, who uses verisimilitude as armour in every work I’ve read. The final book is also sinfully boring until the very end. Neither is any book structured to be a complete story, so you basically have to just plow through to get any answers whatsoever. Yet the advancement of most of the plot is in the first two volumes. Where I fall on this is, because of its length, it has even more of an obligation to justify the craft in the final product, which it simply cannot do. It is by far the worst maximalist effort I have ever had the misfortune of consuming. The junk food of the form. "
184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony,Rating 4 out of 5,"On how fiction is not like math:The role of a story was, in the broadest terms, to transpose a single problem into another form. Depending on the nature and direction of the problem, a solution could be suggested in the narrative. Tengo would return to the real world with that suggestion in hand. It was like a piece of paper bearing the indecipherable text of a magic spell. At times it lacked coherence and served no immediate practical purpose. But it would contain a possibility. Someday he might be able to decipher the spell. That possibility would gently warm his heart from within.Perhaps Murakami was writing his own review of 1Q84, an apology maybe, by the above-quoted passage. Because, really, no one knows for sure whether a daikon radish being grated into a salad is just some random bit of minutiae, filler, or whether it has some hidden existential meaning. Does it matter if the chinos are pleated or not. Don't know. Don't care. I just like the shadow world that Murakami takes me to and I admit to getting a bit confused with the real world around me when reading him. Which is to say: Hell, I don't know what it means either. But he helps me focus and he does indeed suggest somewhere in there a possibility, one that warms me.Tengo, the male protagonist mentioned above, is both mathematician and novelist. At the age of ten he does a kind thing and a ten year-old girl holds his hand. That, just that, will cause a lasting imprint for them both and twenty years later will make them need to find each other. This is the core of this 900-page story. I can see how many readers will find this wispy, even immature. Not me. I believe Murakami when he writes that there are distances that can't be measured - Like the distance that separates one person's heart from another.However, here's my own mathematical formula: Murakami's 1Q84 is to The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (or Kafka on the Shore for that matter) as Richard Russo's Empire Falls is to his Nobody's Fool (or Risk Pool for that matter). Meaning, there is a recycling of themes, symbols, even plot lines. For Russo, just change father and son to father and daughter, as long as the father is divorced or divorcing and can go to an upstate New York diner and hang with a farrago of characters. For Murakami, the male protagonist must have Oedipal angst, has lost a current love, is searching for the true love and deep answers, and is obsessed with ears, music, cats, and breasts...not necessarily in that order. This time, have the female protagonist obsess about her breasts too. But make it artsy by creating two moons, which just happen to have the same asymmetrical shape as, you guessed it, our female protagonist's breasts. I mention and compare Russo because in both Empire Falls and 1Q84, a gun is introduced early in the narrative. And you know what Chekhov said? What? You Don't? That's okay. Russo and Murakami both tell us that Chekhov wrote that ""once a gun appears in a story, it has to be fired at some point."" Or does it? I'm no plot spoiler.This book felt padded to me, as if Murakami had to make it long so it could be his magnum opus, or another Wind-Up Bird Man. So there is a lot of filler. But the characters are wonderfully drawn, new friends. The imagination is as rich as ever. It warmed me. Maybe some day I will even be able to decipher its spell."

For me, this is on par with The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo - seemingly intriguing plot ruined by clunky, repetitive prose and so much bloat you'd think Murakami was on a strict diet of all salt and no water. The only reason this book gets a second star is that, despite all of my complaints, he still managed to keep me optimistically on board for almost the entire first section of the book. With Larsson's book, I lost the will to live almost immediately.4/25/13- ""She pulled a book from her shoulder bag and started reading. It was a history of the South Manchurian Railway Company of the 1930's. The line and right-of-way had been ceded to Japan by Russia after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, after which the company had rapidly expanded its operations, becoming fundamental in Japan's invasion of China. It was broken up by the Soviet army in 1945. Until the outbreak of the Russo-German War in 1941, one could travel between Shimonoseki and Paris in thirteen days via this line and the Trans-Siberian Railway.Aomame figured that a young woman drinking alone in a hotel bar could not be mistaken for a high-class hooker on the prowl if she was wearing a business suit, had a big shoulder bag parked next to her, and sat there absorbed in a book about the South Manchurian Railway (a hardcover, no less).""OK. That first paragraph better end up tying in to some big plot twist later in the book, because if I just sat through that boring ass synopsis of the history of the South Manchurian f'ing Railway Company just to illustrate Murakami's point that a hooker wouldn't be reading something like that.... well, I'm going to be pissed. - ""...did not know why, but ever since the time she was twenty, she had been attracted to men with thinning hair. They should not be completely bald but have something left on top. And thin hair was not all it took to please her. They had to have well-shaped heads. Her ideal type was Sean Connery.

Este libro tiene tantas fallas que de verdad me dejan mal.(Quiero destacar que este libro lo leí en inglés).Es innecesariamente largo. Estoy segura que si me dedicase a eliminar cierta cantidad de capítulos, la historia no se vería en absoluto afectada. Habían capítulos muy aburridos, casi desconectados de la base y propósito de la historia; literalmente eran capítulos de relleno y ni siquiera los disfruté. Los personajes los encontré planos, si bien cada uno tenía su pasado triste del cual querían escapar, en el trascurso de la historia me aburrí de ellos. El único personaje que me gustó fue Ushikawa: su personaje era interesante, llegué a sentir empatía por él y el final que tuvo hasta me produjo pena. Creo que fue el único personaje que valió la pena conocer en esta historia. Odié profundamente cómo se hizo desaparecer a Fuka-Eri; después de toda la importancia que tuvo en la historia se hizo humo como si nada. Se dejó de incluir en los capítulos de a poco hasta que se desvaneció por completo. A la protagonista, Aomame, le calza perfecto el monólogo de Gone Girl. She's a cool girl bajo la mirada de un japonés. La fijación de Murakami con el cuerpo femenino y su sexualidad llegó a un punto de tal ridiculez que creí que llegó hasta a hacerlo a propósito. Pechos, bla bla bla, senos, bla bla bla, cintura y forma de sus dos tetas, bla bla bla. Murakami, no conociste a ni una mujer y se te nota a kilómetros, y parece que te gustan las niñas (sí, lo digo no sólo por la forma en que describía constantemente la forma física de Fuka-Eri, una niña de 17 años, sino también por ese capítulo sexual en específico). Qué terrible esta cuestión. El final, decepcionante. Pero qué puedo pedir si la historia completa lo fue. Murakami tanto que se esforzó en dar una historia con lujo de detalle que llegó a ser latero, sino que además dio un final de tres capítulos donde los protagonistas se encuentran y pum, se solucionó todo el problema. Parece que le dio flojera alargar un poco más el libro. En fin, de verdad lo encontré pésimo.Le doy dos estrellas por el simple hecho de que sí hubieron capítulos que me dejaron metida y enganchada con la trama, porque me gustó Ushikawa como personaje y nada más. Por eso van mis dos estrellas. No puedo creer que me leí más de mil páginas para dar un review de mi mala experiencia."

Agonizingly repetitive. Weird, clumsy metaphors and equally clumsy gestures towards meh-gical realism. Just unnecessarily, uninterestingly wacky.Sorry, not finished. Tell me: how is it that so many of these characters are endowed with this inexplicable talent to intuit the craziest jumps in logic so accurately? With the space of 1,000 pages, I’m disappointed that the unfolding, ‘complex’ plotline wasn’t done more artfully than -oh! - yet another character just knows whaddup based on the smallest vaguery of evidence.Jess sent me a review that had me doin’ a Ras Trent (throwing a backhanded smack at the passage and wordlessly yell-mouthing “yes!”), which is done much more graciously than my moaning and groaning:“Murakami's skill has been to combine the daily routine of a protagonist's life with a surreal events & happenings, whilst making the surreal as everyday as preparing a meal. In 1Q84 Murakami fails to display his usual prowess and instead fills far too many pages with too few happenings. Indeed his translators would have been doing both author and reader a great favour by producing an abridged version so that what little interest the reader has gained in the characters can be rewarded without slogging through repetitive and often clichéd chapters. Even the surrealism & otherworldly links aren't as interesting or involving as previous offerings, and unlike previous novels here we get a little hand-holding explanation. This is the first Murakami book I wouldn’t recommend.”So yeah, the atmosphere I've admired before in Murakami's style is still there, but it's ruined with things like sandwiches, the Little People, the huh? of the two moons, ... repeatedly mentioning Sean Connery (oh yes he di'yd)..., or folksy references to things like the Esso tiger, as well as the many other enigmazzzz that *spoiler* never really get explained. I've got to say, it's a pretty bad sign that I'm relieved these mysteries were overlooked because I cared that little. Half the time these surreal episodes and events came up I actually thought, ""I'm going to pretend that didn't happen,"" and assume the editor just forgot to remove it (because they were really that tedious).Anyway, do not go in there / don't say I didn't dissuade you.

Later that day I was reading 1984 sitting in the lobby of BSK. When I was taking the elevator to Baatighar, somebody in the elevator asked:- Were you reading 1Q84?- Umm.. Nope, it's 1984! This is how 1Q84 looks (setting my left thumb & index finger 900pgs apart)The person simply nodded. It kinda amused me that 1984 could be mistaken as 1Q84! At that very moment I felt let's read them in this same year! But it took me several months before I could get started and even some more time to finish it!I wouldn't say I very much appreciate Murakami's writing even though he is one of my go-to authors. I rather find him going in circles & he is very much trapped within himself! Anyway, I simply read him because his writing is familiar and there's no room for either any good or nasty surprises. That familiarity kinda comforts me even though I don't find the writing anywhere near to be a gamechanger! Anyway, I would wish anyone all the luck before they delve into this 925 pgs long novel. As per goodreads, it took me solid 124 days to finish it (I wasn't reading everyday)! 124 days is really a long time and obviously from time to time I felt very differently how the story was progressing or how it impacted my mood or how my mood impacted how I felt about the reading. So, at this moment with the daylong rain and other confounding factors going in parallel I kinda feel positive about it 🙃""It's a Barnum and Bailey worldJust as phony as it can beBut it wouldn't be make-believeIf you believed in me"""

It says a lot about where we will end up, and is not the only hint that there is not a full and frank explanation at the end of the 900+ pages.Other reviewers have tended to love or hate this book - lots of 4/5 star reviews, and a lot of vitriol in the low end reviews. Obviously a 900+ page book is an investment in time - and some have been disappointed by the result - this wasn't such an issue for me, as I found this really easy to read (ie easy to pick up, hard to put down).No plot outlines here - the synopsis tells enough, and spoilers would be rife. I enjoyed the two main characters, who were interesting and explained themselves in an interesting way, giving out background information in a non-linear, but clever way throughout the book. The peripheral characters were also interesting.The writing format and style also worked well - for me at least. Alternative chapters for the main characters, generally overlapping in time until Book 3, where a third character joins the mix. I note that Book 3 has a different translator than book 1&2 - I am not sure why this is, and it seems counter intuitive to me to do this without good reason, but there isn't a noticeable change.So, looks like I will search out some more Murakami novels (even though i don't read a lot of fiction).Four and a half stars, short of five stars, so settling at four."

The third made me come to the conclusion that Murakami has a serious obsession about sex and body image, or possibly appearance? I mean, even the chick that wore glasses was described that way multiple times. But good god, he needs to shut the hell up! He's positively neurotic!The problem for me is that I have OCD so I have more than my own share of neurotic, obsessive thinking patterns. I don't need someone else's and I definitely don't need his neuroses to kick off my own neurotic loops.Seriously, if you don't have OCD and you don't mind someone incessantly talking about sex and what everyone looks like then this would probably work. I do have to agree with my friend, John, who said that the audio was really cool, especially as it came together at the end. It was very well done.However, if anybody describes anybody else in exhaustive detail at any point in the next two weeks I'm going to go totally insane.Or maybe it was just that it was 47 hours of audio.

The kind of thing that you have to remind yourself constantly isn't real and the people in it aren't real. At the same time, this isn't my favorite Murakami. It's certainly up there, but there are others that seem more perfect. Less labored. This one almost seems conscious of trying to be Murakami's big book. Smolders more than burns with the insane magic fire. It just seems like sometimes you can see the seams. It is still a better book than most authors can dream of, but I've enjoyed other of Murakami's more.

200,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62540837-biron-pa-a,Rating 2 out of 5,"Tengo, Fukaeri'nin kitabı Pupa Hava'yı okurken sık sık eleştirmenlerin ve okurların kitabı yanlış okumasından yakınarak birkaç kez ""Bu kitabı anlamak için değil, ona inanmak için okumak gerekir,"" diyor. Basit bir çıkarımla, bunun, Murakami'nin 1Q84 romanını okurun nasıl okuması gerektiğine yönelik ""talimatı"" olarak yorumlayabiliriz. Bu sebeple burada Orwell'ın 1984'üyle içerdiği metinlerarasılık, bana kalırsa önemli bir yere oturmuyor metinde. Murakami'nin edebiyat anlayışını Roland Barthes'ın ""Yazarlık metin"" diye tanımladığı, okurun metni kendisinin kurguladığı edebiyat anlayışına yakın görebiliriz. Tengo'nun Pupa Hava'yı okuma serüveni üzerinden gidelim. Tengo önce, dikkatlice birkaç kez okuyor Pupa Hava'yı, sonra onu düzeltiyor. Pupa Hava çok kötü yazılmış bir metin, çoğu yerde tasvirler yetersiz, anlatım kötü. Sadece bir hikâye var. Tengo onu iyi bir edebiyat eseri şekline sokuyor, tasvirleri genişletiyor, ayrıntılandırıyor. Bunu kelimeler ile hayal gücü arasındaki ayrım gibi görebiliriz. Biz de yalnızca kelimelerden meydana gelen bir metni elimize alıyor ve okuyor, sonra da onu hayal gücümüzle (aklımızın sinemasında) görselleştiriyoruz. Ardından Tengo, Pupa Hava'nın dünyasında, onun kurallarında geçen, çok daha uzun (Pupa Hava'nın 200 sayfa civarı olduğu söyleniyor, 1Q84 ise 1256 sayfa) başka bir roman yazıyor. Yani Barthes'ın yazarlık metin dediğine yakın olarak, eserin dünyası üzerine akıl yürütüyor, kavramaya çalışıyor, genişletiyor; tabii Barthes'tan farklı olarak, Pupa Hava'nın öyküsünü de kapsayan başka bir hikâye yazıyor Tengo, fakat Murakami'nin bize vermek istediği ilhamın bu olduğunu söyleyebiliriz.Romanın felsefesine basitçe de olsa değindik, biçimine de değinelim. Daha önce, burada da, Murakami ile Ishiguro'yu, ikisi de sürreal dünyalarda geçen, gerçekliğin sık sık büküldüğü romanlar yazdıkları için benzetmiş, Ishiguro'nun altı dolu romanlarıyla Murakami'nin bile isteye boşaltılmış, cevabı kendisinin de bilmediği gizemlerle dolup taşan romanlarını kıyaslamıştım. Bu romanı okuduktan sonra, Murakami ile Roberto Bolano'yu birbirine benzetmenin daha doğru olabileceğini, ikisinin birbirine daha yakın yazarlar olduğunu düşünmeye başladım. İkisi de birçok yönden benziyor, bir sürü yönden de ayrışıyor ama en bariz olanı şu, alışıldık anlatı biçimlerini, kurgu oyunlarını kullanmaktan kaçınıyorlar. Şöyle örnekleyelim, bir hikâyede okur genelde belli başlı duyguları yaşar, güler, üzülür, buruk bir hüzün hisseder vb. ve bu duygular, daha önce sık sık gördüğümüz şekillerde karşımıza çıkar; elbet farklılıklar vardır, yoksa hiçbir etki uyandırmaz, ama genelde makyajdır. Tabii Murakami istediği kadar teknik klişelerden kaçsın, bunun uğruna edebiyat yapmaktan vazgeçsin, yakalanıyor. Tüm roman Tarantino filmlerinde sıkça karşımıza çıkan bir yöntemle kurgulanmış. Tarantino filmlerinde, her zaman için birbirini her an vurabilecekler karşı karşıya gelir, günlük hayattan, havadan sudan, filmlerden, yemeklerden uzun uzun, dakikalarca bahseder; en az bir kez Tarantino filmi izleyen izleyici bilir ki birazdan kan akacak ve böylece izlediği her saniyeyi ""sıkıcı konuşmalar"" olarak sınıflandırmak yerine gergin bir bekleyiş içerisinde izler. 1Q84 ise, karakterlerin -Murakami'nin anlatmayı beceremediği- günlük hayatlarını, yakalanabilecekleri, başlarına kötü bir şey geleceği yahut Tengo ile Aomame'nin asla kavuşamayacağı endişesi ile vermeye çalışıyor. Bolano'da da, Murakami'de de bu klasik anlatı biçimlerine girmekten ölesiye kaçınıyorlar. Ama Bolano bu işin altından hem hikâyeci anlatımı, hem yazarlık kabiliyeti ile kalkabilirken, Murakami kaçındığı şeylerden dolayı yalnızca gizem yaratabiliyor. Örneğin 2666'daki cinayetlerin işlendiği bölüm, klasik anlatı biçimlerinden uzak, okurda neredeyse polis raporlarını okuyormuş hissi bıraktığı halde, nasıl oluyorsa yoğun bir edebiyat taşıyor. Oysa 1Q84'te, daha önce Renksiz Tsukuru Tazaki'nin Hac Yılları romanı için yazdığım ""yazarın fantezilerini okurdan çekindiği için dizginlemesi"" (Murakami'nin bir ana tema etrafında değil de bir duygunun etrafında roman yazmaya çalıştığını, o duyguya ulaşmak için de rasyonel ve alışıldık, keşfedilmiş hikâyeler değil, kendi fantezilerini kullandığını vurgulamıştım) durumu yaşanmasa bile, oldukça yetersiz bir yazarlık görüyoruz. Proust'un yazarlığı kendi kayıp zamanını aramayı içerdiği için, Kayıp Zamanın İzinde'de sık sık çok ayrıntılı mekân betimlemeleri okuyoruz örneğin, yahut Orhan Pamuk'un Masumiyet Müzesi'nde 100 sayfalık ""oturma"" bölümü görüyoruz; oysa Murakami romanlarında ne hikmetse hep dinamik, ayrıntısız, detaysız bir dünya görüyoruz. Murakami genelde bir şeyleri kafaya takıp da onu sayfalarca anlatmaktan kaçınıyor. Zaten kendisi de şöyle söylüyor:""Yeah. I go to my subconsciousness. I have to go into that chaos. But the act of going and coming back is kind of routine. You have to be practical. So every time I say, if you want to write a novel you have to be practical, people get bored. They are disappointed. They are expecting a more dynamic, creative, artistic thing to say. What I want to say is: you have to be practical.""Murakami'nin romanlarında amaç genelde okuru metnin sonuna kadar merakta bırakmak. Yine Tengo, Pupa Hava ile ilgili eleştirmenlerin ""Sonuna kadar okutuyor ama bir şeyler eksik, bir olmamışlık var,"" demesine de sinirlenip, ""Sonuna kadar okutuyorsa nasıl bir şeyler eksik olabilir ki?"" diyor. Tabii kimse de Tengo'ya çıkıp pornolar da sonuna kadar izletiyor ama kimse pornoyu çekene Kubrick muamelesi yapmıyor, demiyor romanda.Yine de bu romanında, kendisinin kısa romanlarına kıyasla, çok daha anlatması zor, yazarlık kabiliyeti gerektiren bir işe soyunuyor ve yukarıda değindiğim nitelikli edebiyat örneklerine benzer bir işe kalkışıyor Murakami. Fakat beceremiyor. Aomame'nin parkın karşısındaki evde geçirdiği zamanı, bu bölümün uzun uzun anlatılmasından bahsediyorum örneğin. Neredeyse çok büyük kısmı tekrarlardan oluşan, döne dolaşa aynı şeyleri vurgulayan, karakterin ilk 400-500 sayfada değinilenden başka hiçbir özelliğine değinilmeyen bu bölümler son derece yetersiz, emeksiz. Aynısı Tengo için de geçerli, okur ilk 400 sayfadan sonra romanı bıraksa, tüm romanı okuyandan farklı olarak Tengo'nun karakterine, hikâyesine dair ne öğrenmiş olacak? Cevabım hiçbir şey.İşte Bolano ile Murakami'nin arasındaki fark bu, bana kalırsa. Evet, ikisi de bir ana fikrin etrafında dönmeyen, Çehov yahut Alice Munro benzeri derinlikli karakter incelemesi yapmayan, Orhan Pamuk veya Mo Yan benzeri tarihi ve sosyolojik meseleleri incelemeyen, yine Pamuk ve Eco gibi felsefi sorunsalları romanın merkezine koymayan yazarlar Bolano ve Murakami. Oysa Bolano'nun kendisine Giuseppe Arcimboldo'yu esin kaynağı seçmesinin bir sebebi var, onun resimlerinde birbirinden bağımsız parçalar birleşerek bir bütün yaratılıyor. Biz 2666 romanı boyunca, birbirinden bağımsız hikâyeleri okuyor ve Arcimboldi'nin izini sürüyoruz romanın ilk bölümündeki eleştirmenler gibi (Vahşi Hafiyeler de benzer bir mantıkla yazılmış). Oysa 1Q84'te, karakterlerin obsesyonları, motivasyonları en baştan, hiçbir derinlik kaygısı gütmeden art arda sıralanıyor ve sonrasında yazar sanki romanla ilgili akıl yürütmeyi bırakıp yalnızca sayfaların sayısını arttırıyor."
201,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4582860-tanabrus,Rating 5 out of 5,"Parlare di questo libro è difficile.Ma la cosa non è certo sorprendente, essendo un libro di Murakami.E dato che, bene o male, la trama di fondo si trova facilmente ovunque, mi limiterò a esprimere qualche sensazione che questa lettura mi ha lasciato.Prima cosa: mi è piaciuto. Mi è piaciuto molto.La cosa non mi stupisce granché, visto quanto mi piacciono i libri del sensei, ma a volte anche alcune sue opere mi hanno lasciato più indifferente. Stavolta no, ero totalmente catturato.Cioè, se finisci a pensare a Tengo e a Aomame anche quando ti prendi qualche pausa dalla lettura, diciamo per andare in vacanza, per visitare un museo o semplicemente per cazzeggiare senza pensiero alcuno, direi che il libro cattura.Seconda cosa: l'idea degli universi in cui, per qualche motivo, si entra pur rimanendo circondati da gente che non è consapevole di vivere in tale universo differente da ciò che dovrebbe essere, è affascinante. Cervellotica, quasi incomprensibile, ma affascinante.E così abbiamo Aomame che, dopo aver sceso all'inizio del libro le scale di emergenza in autostrada, col tempo si accorge di essere in un altro posto.Un Giappone in cui alcuni eventi si svolti in maniera differente, cambiando sensibilmente la storia. Una Terra dove in cielo esiste una seconda luna, verde e più piccola, vicina alla Luna che è sempre esistita. Una seconda luna visibile solamente da coloro che per qualche motivo finiscono in questa realtà e capiscono di esserci finiti, diventano giocatori attivi, personaggi importanti in questo mondo dove esiste il Piccolo Popolo, che si immischia da sempre negli affari umani, guidando leader e decidendo le sorti della Storia. Una realtà che Aomame rinomina 1Q84, essendo l'anno il 1984, dove la Q sta per question mark (oltre al gioco fonetico giapponese, dove Q e 9 hanno suni simili), indica le incognite cui si trova di fronte la ragazza, insegnante di palestra e in segreto assassina di uomini che si approfittano delle donne e non hanno alcuna possibilità di redenzione.Così tra i protagonisti abbiamo Fuka Eri, diciassettenne Murakiana bellissima e irraggiungibile, superiore alle meschinità umane, mossa da un destino quasi divino, dotata di una consapevolezza inumana e praticamente quasi sempre totalmente aliena.Ovviamente abbiamo Tengo (tipico protagonista del sensei, dotato e intelligente ma privo di ambizioni, e che si lascia trascinare dalla corrente senza mai tentare di raggiungere i suoi obbiettivi, dato che non ne ha), che riscrive in una forma perfetta la storia di Fuka Eri. Una storia che smaschera il Piccolo Popolo e lo indebolisce. Una storia che non comprende pienamente, ma che gli fa aprire gli occhi e gli fa capire di essere in un mondo con due lune. Due lune che lui stesso ha inventato e descritto, al momento della riscrittura della storia di Fuka Eri... è Tengo a plasmare il mondo, unendo le proprie energie a quelle della ragazza misteriosa? O la sua vicinanza lo rende consapevole a un livello intuitivo del mondo che lo circonda realmente?Qualunque sia la risposta, è intrigante questo mondo dove esiste la magia del Piccolo Popolo ed esistono due lune.Terza cosa: la storia d'amore tra Tengo e Aomame.Adorabile.Due bambini con infanzie problematiche, lui costretto dal padre a seguirlo nei fine settimana mentre raccoglie i soldi per l'emittente radiofonica porta a porta, minacciando e blandendo le persone, lei costretta dalla madre Testimone di Geova integralista ad andare porta a porta per il vicinato per tentare di fare proseliti. Due bambini che a dieci anni notano l'esistenza dell'altro. Aomame raggiunge Tengo e gli prende la mano, stringendola con decisione per diversi secondi, con il tempo che si sembra fermare.Da quella stretta di mano troverà la forza di lasciare la religione dei parenti, venendo spedita da qualche lontano parente. Ma anche Tengo da quella stretta di mano riceverà una nuova forza, riuscendo ad andare contro il volere del padre e smettendo di seguirlo.E i due, per venti anni, rimangono sostanzialmente liberi da impegni, sempre pensando all'altro. Senza più vederlo. Senza più cercarlo. Un amore totalmente platonico, e la certezza che un giorno, il destino ci farà incontrare di nuovo. E lo riconoscerò di sicuro.Lei che vive da sola, cercando eventuali incontri occasionali, da una notte, nei bar, quando ne ha bisogno.Lui che vive da solo, con una ragazza che vede una volta a settimana, sposata ma insoddisfatta.Nessuno dei due ha amici, nessuno dei due ha una vera vita. Entrambi aspettano ancora l'altro, lei coscientemente, lui inconsciamente.Venti anni. Dopo qualche secondo di stretta di mano.Affascinante, davvero!Quarta cosa: la storia.Molte le storie che si intrecciano alla principale, senza mai essere dei tie-in ma sempre con un significato all'interno del romanzo.Molte le situazioni che ci lasciano curiosi, molti i personaggi che promettono di essere più di quanto sembrano, tra ipotetici messaggeri divini, vittime innocenti, misteri irrisolti del passato, personaggi interessanti di cui vorremmo sapere di più.E quando molte di queste situazioni rimangono non spiegate, non si prova nemmeno fastidio: la storia è la storia di Tengo e Aomame, e se loro non sanno certe cose non c'è bisogno per noi di saperle.La città dei gatti, la clinica del padre di Tengo con le tre infermiere, la vecchia ereditiera e la sua efficiente guardia del corpo, la bambina fuggita dalla setta, il misterioso esattore della radio, lo strangolatore di donne. E poi dotha e maza e air chrisalys.Ecco, non mi sarebbe dispiaciuta qualche spiegazione sul dualismo dotha-maza. E Fuka Eri era un maza? Se si, dove si trova la vera Fuka Eri (se si può parlare di vera e finta, ovvio). O la sua condizione dipende dalla sua fuga dopo aver visto la maza nella crisalide?Per non parlare della crisalide che Tengo vede alla clinica... che fine ha fatto? E' davvero la crisalide il little one in Aomame? E la setta, sapeva che i due progettavano di fuggire da quella realtà? O non lo ritenevano possibile, e semplicemente attendevano la nascita e lo sviluppo della crisalide?Malgrado le domande senza risposta, non mi sento minimamente deluso. Sarà che ormai sono abituato a questi finali aperti, a questi romanzi dove realtà e fantastico si mescolano al romanzo di crescita e non vengono mai fornite risposte, vengono solamente accennati possibili spunti di riflessione.Quinta cosa: il finale.A metà del terzo libro pensavo che non ci sarebbe stato tempo per un finale bene elaborato, ho dovuto controllare più volte per essere certo di avere tutti e tre i libri insieme. E ho pensato a qualche finale del mio tipo, tragico ed epico.Andando avanti le cose si sono mosse con più velocità, ma ugualmente il cerchio intorno ad Aomame si faceva sempre più stretto e avevo in mente diversi possibili finali.Onestamente però non mi aspettavo minimamente il finale che invece Murakami ha scritto. Non me lo aspettavo, e mi è piaciuto. Ogni tanto ci vuole anche un finale così, del resto.Insomma, il libro mi è piaciuto. E tanto.Me lo sono tenuto da parte per otto mesi, ma l'attesa è stata ben ripagata."
202,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11665678-kyle,Rating 2 out of 5," So, at the age of 10, two children went on a crazy acid trip about an alternate reality where there are two moons in the sky, magical midgets use the mouths of dead goats as doorways to a fun party, cocoons capable of growing infertile copies of people are woven out of thin air, and it's possible to impregnate people from miles away. 20 years later, these children come out of their acid trip unscathed and ready to move on with their adult lives. ... Okay, so that isn't really what this book is about. At least, the part about 10 year-old children taking acid. That would be crazy and irresponsible! Say no to drugs! All the other stuff is perfectly reasonable material to build your story out of, though. At least, it might be if you had an actual story to tell. 1Q84 has an inordinate amount of fat which needed to be cut out. The book is about 1200 pages long, yet the story could have been told in a couple hundred. Such a lengthy format isn't unheard of in the novel world, especially if your novel is stuffed full of allegory, interesting exposition, thoughtful musings, or other such things which might actually be worth reading. About a hundred pages into Dostoyevsky's masterwork  Crime and Punishment, the majority of the ""action"" of the novel starts to take place within Raskolnikov's head. The story movement, and plot devices, are largely psychological. It makes for a long book, with little action happening beyond the confines of the main character's mind. Yet every word is worth reading. I wish I could say the same thing for 1Q84. Unfortunately in 1Q84, we see no such care devoted to the passages filling the book. Murakami makes an abundance of references to random literature, political figures, or musical pieces, all for reasons I'm sure only he understands. Perhaps even he doesn't. Not only are whole passages worthless in the novel (worthless meaning they contribute absolutely nothing to the story), there are entire characters who are worthless too. Imagine if Samwise Gamgee didn't travel with Frodo. What if Samwise followed Frodo's adventure from a distance? Observing, taking notes, and chronicling Frodo's adventure in a journal. Imagine too, that nobody in the fellowship knows about Samwise following them, nor do the servants of Sauron. In such a scenario Samwise is completely disconnected from impacting the other characters. Now imagine we get a large portion of the Lord of The Rings devoted to following Samwise's point of view (let's say roughly a third of one of the books). Then, near the end of the book, Samwise is eaten by a troll, and the chronicle he was writing becomes burned. Nobody knows Samwise died, since they didn't even know he was there. Nobody is able to read the journal he wrote, and no other contribution of Samwise's survives. What the bloody hell was the point of his character then?! He would be a worthless character, contributing nothing, impacting nothing. Only living, observing, and dying. Yet we can even take it one step further! Let's create a different character. We'll call him WorthSmashless, the Troll. He doesn't have any meaningful conversation with anybody, doesn't impact anybody's life in the novel, nor does he contribute anything else to the story (besides length). The only impact he has on the plot of the book is to eat Samwise and burn the journal he was writing. After he accomplishes this task, he wanders off and we forget about him. So, we have a worthless character killed by another worthless character, and the only purpose they serve in the book is to cancel each other out. Even Tolkien managed to not add that degree of extra fluff to his books, yet it is a trap Murakami not only falls into, but embraces. Murakami comes across as being proud of his worthless references, worthless passages, and worthless characters. He flaunts them, caresses them, and continually points the reader toward them saying ""look, look! Isn't that passage profound? Am I not a sophisticated writer, who writes intellectual things?"" ...My answer is a resounding No. His passages are not sophisticated, or profound; They're tiresome. His story isn't deep, or creative; It's simply boring.I don't enjoy writing a negative review. I can only try and be honest with how I felt about the book, while trying to maintain civility. Haruki Murakami is an internationally respected author who has written many, highly lauded, novels. He has received piles of praise from all corners of the world, and this is the only book of his I've ever read. My review is of the book, not the character of the author. Many people love this book and rate it highly. My intention is not to try and run anyone down, only to contribute to the wide range of opinions any book receives after being published. After all the criticism I give the book, however, there are still some redeeming features to the book. Some, and I mean  Some  of the passages are smartly written, regardless of their relevance to the novel as a whole. There were even a couple sections of the book where I grunted in approval at a clever line, or a particularly well-described something. As I said before, this book is filled with fat, but IF it happened to be trimmed down to size, and the novel made into a small book, then there would actually be a serviceable and possibly enjoyable book remaining. Murakami just needs to remember that length doesn't add complexity, tangents don't support exposition, and references should be thoughtful instead of pointless. I might rate 1Q84, the novella, fairly high as a largely enjoyable and quick read. Yet 1Q84 the 1200-page, 3-book novel, must be criticized for what I think it actually is, an overall waste of time.If you're interested in reading an entertaining, Positive review, then you might try this one as an alternative to my opinions. http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/..."

The beauty of Murakami's writing is in the perspective he brings with aspects of Asian culture and thinking such as yin & yang, spirits of deceased and personal interactions. I feel Western writers could not bring forth such themes and subtleties and because of this, I found this hefty 900+ page novel something I didn't want to put down.I will no doubt seek out more of his works.Due to sexual content, this book remains in the realm of adults."

206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/284242-jess-sanford,Rating 5 out of 5,"Say, its only a paper moonSailing over a cardboard seaBut it wouldn’t be make-believeIf you believed in me Desperate as I always feel after finishing a Murakami novel to write up something profound and properly expressive of what his work seems to always so easily do to me, I never have until now. It always feels futile, foolish–I feel like a three-year-old who has seen a supernova; it’s nearly impossible to really articulate what I’ve encountered, yet perhaps a rich, ambivalent sensory befuddlement is all one can hope for in art. I feel this way more than ever after finishing his most recent and hand-achingly thick masterpiece, but here I am nonetheless.1Q84 feels like quintessential Murakami, full of surreal moments both dazzling and (to this reader, enjoyably) mundane, cats, sadness, loneliness, death, hope, the ethereal and the grubbily all-too-real. Everyone has lost something, and everyone is looking looking looking. I can’t ever get over the strange and deliriously paced tone of this and his other books, a tone that in my experience is some mixture of both the translation process and Murakami’s indelible presence. It feels comfortable but a bit askew, which of course fits into the Murakami Mode almost too perfectly. If I say that the phrases and paragraphs always seem slightly wary and confused, it isn’t a critique of either of those to aspects; rather, I genuinely enjoy the tentative feeling of almost literally every line in the book. There’s a sad but quiet intensity, anxiety hanging over everything, it’s beautiful but off-putting (not unlike the double moons hanging in the sky of this somehow-but-not-exact-alternate 1984 Tokyo, one normal and one smaller, dented, green).Many people seem to experience (whether they enjoy it or not) the distinct feeling that Murakami bleeds over into their real world somehow, taints them — this is absolutely the case for myself, it’s always been the hallmark to me of fiction that has a special staying power, has an elusive brilliance. I honestly don’t feel like I’ll ever look at the moon again with remembering this book; even moments of transit seem to draw it quickly back to my memory, as the characters here are always traveling in one form or another. I was struck even by stunning little coincidences while reading that seemed to signify that I, too, had somehow been pulled a little into a strange alternate reality, had become a shade of green. While sitting down to write this my cat suddenly became incessantly noisy and playful as if trying absurdly hard to keep my attention elsewhere. While reading what was to me the most intense moment of the most intense chapter near the end of the book, ‘It’s Only A Paper Moon’ sung by a very young Ella Fitzgerald came onto my Pandora station (I hadn’t even ‘Like’ed the song until then), which very honestly unsettled me for a moment. The ‘moon’ connection aside, the song appears throughout the nove as jazz and classical music one more haunt Murakami’s fiction. I had never liked a single jazz song I had ever heard until some of the music in the book sent me searching out of curiosity, and now I cannot get enough. Haunting and infectious perfectly describe this book.I’ve seen some criticism of the book’s close, that it offers either not enough or too much closure. I suppose I’m too easy to please, to connected to what I feel is the Murakami experience I so much seek out and enjoy. I felt at peace with the ending; it’s heavily bent and untidy, but that’s one thing I love about this book and the rest of his fiction — it’s never tidy, it’s never polished or feels like, once you’re done, that the book will even fit conveniently back onto the bookshelf. I remember when reading Murakami for the first time, Kafka on the Shore, how struck I was by the duality in these surreal iconic characters and their presences–we first see Johnny Walker, a dashing and menacing presence–but then we get…KFC’s Colonel Sanders!? This absurdity, this refusal towards perhaps easier (to write, and to read) gestures and choices. This isn’t what he ‘does’, and it’s why I’ll always come back to his work. It’s unsettling, imperfect, confused, awkward, brilliant and it will sometimes tarry, sometimes disappear without waiting for you."
207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/185835-yulia,Rating 4 out of 5,"(4 stars) I didn't know what to expect from 1Q84 as there was so much hype and I didn't believe it could live up to its expectations, especially as I'd grown quite disillusioned as a Murakami fan in recent years due to a string of uninspired books (Kafka on the Shore; Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman; After Dark). So I was skeptical to enter the world of 1Q84, until I realized that my concern and hesitation about this book were unfounded and I allowed myself to savor the experience. What an exciting and thoroughly satisfying work this proved to be. It holds its place among his strongest books as a consistent and well-executed work, here successfully super-sized, with none of the sudden abandonning of characters (May Kasahara, the Kano sisters) and dragging of pace (the well, the well!) that plague Wind-up Bird Chronicle. I feel so proud of Murakami and relieved and encouraged that he's not run out of steam as an author but honed his voice and targeted his strengths (his dazzling analogies, female characters and the captivating side characters which get more attention here). The chapters may alternate between Tengo and Aomame's perspectives and there may be initial doubt over which female to be more interested in, Aomame or Fuka-eri, but in the end there is no question that it is Aomame who carries this work. Not only does she have the endearing idiosyncrasies of clasic Murakami female characters, but she has more nuance and depth to her character. In other words, she isn't just someone to put on a pedestal or fetishize. On the other hand, Tengo's father, the NHK fee collector, is perhaps the most haunting character in the book. Having already read Murakami's short story in The New Yorker which provides the foundation for Tengo's and his father's character (http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/feat...), ""Town of Cats"", I loved seeing how Murakami developed the father's story and gave resonance to his seemingly random job. A flaw in the work is the basis for the unbreakable connection between Tengo and Aomame, the depiction of love being a recurring issue in Murakmi's work, but Murakami helped ease my discomfort over their implausible bond when the two do finally unite at the end of the book. One of the special treats of listening to the audio version is to hear the two narrators come together finally and occupy the same world. And for those who still insist the love was baseless, consider all the classics that feature irrational or shallow connections. It's no excuse, but it does help to see his failing in context. As for criticism in the NY Times Sunday Book Review that proper weight isn't given to the atrocities in this book, I suppose it's up to the reader to determine whether they must take everything in fiction as seriously as they would in real-life. As for whether it's appropriate to mourn the loss of a dear friend by missing her irretrievable breasts, all I can say is, it doesn't seem irrational at all to focus on a seemingly irrelevant or even objustifying aspect of a loved one instead of confronting the immensity of one's loss, but that's not something I expect to convince those who are morally offended of.This book may cause a boost in sales for Charles Jourdan shoes or rubber plants, but rest asured, the popularity of this work does not rest merely on the cult of Murakami.For those curious about why Janacek's ""Sinfonietta"" is perhaps the worst music to listen to in a traffic jam, you'll understand immediately once you hear it: http://youtu.be/o3p2XxjuV0YMy appreciation for Murakami has reached a new high, but to be on the safe side, I shouldn't expect his next work to be as rewarding as 1Q84. Hmm . . . "
208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7136073-lis,Rating 5 out of 5,"Original, mysterious, attention-grabbing, and it held on to you until the end. Also the prose was like poetry in prose form, if that even makes sense. It was a masterpiece.All of the characters, whether their intentions were positive or negative, became quick favorites. They were distinct and different from anything I'd ever encountered, which is part of what made them so interesting to watch.Murakami has this great ability to connect everything. He takes two different people, living in completely different situations that truly knew each other from a fleeting moment in elementary school, plops them in 1984 twenty years later, and eventually has everything in one's life connect to the other. From Sakhalin's Island to air chrysalises to the shooting in 1981 to Tengo's father to the year 1Q84, everything is absolutely connected and nothing is not essential. Because I don't want to keep rambling on about how much of a masterpiece this was, I'm going to be picky.There was a lot of sex. Yes, this book is definitely not for prudes. I felt like every sex scene was necessary to an extent, however, because it provided useful characterization of Aomame and Tengo, even if it was through characters like Ayumi and Ushikawa.The only sex scenes that I felt were bland, uninteresting, and frankly useless were the ones between Tengo and his married girlfriend. They told us almost nothing that we didn't know before. Because everything else in the book has so much connectivity with one another and this book is longer than Les Miserables already, the scenes seemed to be glaringly obvious instances of unnecessary fluff to fill Tengo's chapters with.Additionally, I've noticed this habit that Murakami has when he depicts his character's thought processes. It's tiny, it's not really that much of an issue, but with the perfection of the rest of his prose, it was kind of disconcerting. And it doesn't just happen once.Let me give you an example from the book. Aomame is doing her morning ritual, taking a shower, etc. There's an instance where she is examining the cuticles of her fingernails, but suddenly, suddenly she's thinking about her existence in the universe and what it all means.Another example: Tengo is having sex with his married girlfriend and he is looking at her leg for a fleeting moment, but suddenly he's not connected at all to what he's doing and he's thinking about Fukada and Air Chrysalises.Okay, yes, if we're going to talk about human psychology, we tend to have small attention spans and our thoughts jump around for a bit. If you're considering a rainbow-colored wallpaper and you suddenly start thinking about how you're going to cook vegetables for dinner, however, it's strange and not really how humans behave. Perhaps you consider the rainbow wallpaper and your eyes settle on the color purple and you start thinking about eggplants and how you're going to cook them for dinner. That makes sense. So Murakami has this issue with not articulating intermediary thoughts between subjects, which can make his book choppy and uncoordinated at times.The instances when this does happen, are so minute and unimportant that it was almost not worth mentioning. Almost.Anyway, that's pretty much all of the complaints I have about this book, if you can even call them that. I just really loved this book. Highly recommended to any and all bibliophiles from any genres."
209,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6721230-paula,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is the most monotonous work I have ever encountered. Nothing ever happens. Or something very interesting happens, but the author skims over it with one brief comment and then goes into excruciating detail about some other minutia, like what they ate, how it was prepared, what was on the side, what spice was used to season it, how much was used, and how was it chopped, course or fine, and then lists a metaphor about how course or fine, why it was chopped that way...blah blah blah. Even the rare event that can not be classified as day to day minutia is interesting at best- like a dream that doesn't make sense, but is so odd that it makes an impression anyway, even if it is disjointed and has no real meaning.It is so insanely repetitive... I just spent 20 minutes reading a passage about Aomami considering buying a goldfish and deciding on a rubber tree instead (which we already know is the outcome and has no relevance to the plot). I skipped ahead 3-4 pages to get past it, and she was still thinking about it when I resumed. That's where I quit the book after about 30 hours. The author repeats everything and repeats it and repeats it. It makes me want to scream. Every time he mentions the fish, the one she doesnt buy that has nothing to do with the story- its not just ""fish"" it is the gold fish that she saw on this date that she considered buying after she saw someone else's goldfish, in this particular store, in this location, next to that other place, where she eventually bought a rubber tree, which was a sad specimen- as if you could possibly have forgotten what fish he was talking about a half sentence ago, and the state of the rubber tree has anything to do with the stupid fish and neither have anythign to do with the story! At one point he describes the character Leader breathing deeply - it takes him 2 pages to do it- and the word deeply must be repeated 20 times. Reading this book is like grading a whole 6th grade classes' answers to a vocabulary test- he gives you a word; list a simile, a metaphor, a synonym, use it in a sentence, then repeat 28 times. I'm not kidding. He goes so far that in ALL of the dialog between Tengo and Fukaeri, Tengo  literally repeats verbatim every word  Fukaeri just finished saying before adding his comment. All of the other dialog is like this to a slightly lesser, but no less irritating, extent. Not only does the author describe what IS there with every possible word that might be applicable - but he then proceeds list everything it can not be... There IS a second moon. It could not be a plane. It could not be a star, it could not be a comet, it could not be his imagination, it could not be a trick of the light... I GET IT ALREADY! MOVE ON! like some twisted 50 hour non-rhyming version of green eggs and ham. It should have been a 200 page book. Seems like in the process of editing the author added new text, without deleting any of the old text that should have been replaced. He wrote each sentence a dozen different ways and couldn't decide which he liked best, so just left them all. just in case you are a complete nincompoop and didn't understand the first 11 times he described it. Its excrutiating. "
210,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2912231-carisa-burns,Rating 1 out of 5,"Horrible. What is wrong with the people who voted for this as the best fiction book of this year. Really people? Really?!! The story is painful, slow torture. I read maybe half the book and gave up since all it did was repeat character's storylines over and over and over and over and over. And, we still have learned minimal information about both the plot and the characters. Quite a few chapters are devoted to discussing the rewriting of a manuscript without telling us what the story is even about. They speak endlessly back and forth like a tennis match where no one ever drops the ball about if it is good, if it is not good, if they will rewrite it, if they won't, if it is ethical, if it is not, rinse and repeat over and over again. Then, as if that's not bad enough, there is finally a chapter where Tengo decides to edit the book and we have to tolerate his boring and monotenous description of how long it is taking him to write. He describes it in every kind of terms you can think of time passing - is that really necessary? So boring. We're not even told what he's writing or what the story is really about so it basically just goes something like this:. ""I'm rewriting some book that is about something really awesome. It takes me forever - the clock is ticking. I look up and it's 12pm. Oh man it's taking so long. Dogs bark, cars honk. It's taking me so long..soo so long. I'm writing and writing and writing and writing about stuff you dont know about but it's super good, I promise. Really, take my word for it that the book is really really awesome - the best you've ever read even though I have to edit the entire thing. NO, it's not pointless at all. Not anymore pointless than my description of how I'm rewriting it. I look up at the clock and now it's 1pm. And some more writing, writing, writing. I move my finger, my pen falls....blah, blah , blah, blah. I look up and it's 3pm. ....and so on and so on and so on.""NOTHING HAPPENS and even if it ever does - I DONT' CARE. I hope Tengo and ""Edomame"" (Aomamae - stupid name) meet so that ""Edomame"" can assasinate him and then she can climb back up the stupid ladder back into the traffic where she came from so a car can just run her over and put all of us out of our misery. How did anyone like this book even a little bit? I would be more enthralled watching paint dry. Best book of the year? UGH. More like the worst. Who is voting on these things? So glad this was a library rental and I didn't have to waste money on it. Thanks everyone who voted this as best book of the year for wasting my time on even picking this one up."

Bermula dengan After The Quake diikuti Hear The Wind Sing dan 1973, Pinball.2. Ada beberapa kenalan aku mengatakan 1Q84 adalah magnum opus Haruki Murakami. Aku tak mampu mengesahkan kesahihannya sehinggalah trilogi ini ditamatkan.3. Aku beri 4/5 bintang untuk Book 1, 2/5 bintang untuk Book 2 dan 0/5 bintang untuk book 3. Keseluruhannya, 2.5/5 untuk so-called trilogi 1Q84.4. Kelemahan terbesar 1Q84 (menurut sisi pandangan peribadi) adalah repitisi naratif yang monotonous. Aku masih terima gaya penulisan monolog bagi watak Aomame dan Tengo dalam Book 1. Ia menarik sebab Murakami berjaya merakam cara hidup seseorang yang simple, straightforward, sederhana dengan aliran bahasa yang mengalir. Macam dia pergi kedai, mengajar di sekolah, naik tren, memasak dan serba satu aktiviti harian orang biasa buat. Kita boleh rasa hidup dalam penceritaan tersebut kerana kitalah orang biasa-biasa itu.5. Tetapi masuk Book 2, apatah lagi Book 3, gaya penulisaan yang sama ini mula membosankan. Melelahkan. Hampir keseluruhan cerita dihabiskan dengan termenung dan monolog dalaman. Kita seperti sedang membuang masa membaca cerita watak yang sedang membuang masa mereka. 6. Konsep Maza, Dohta, 2 bulan, Little People yang diketengahkan sangat menarik. Tetapi Murakami cuma sentuh gitu-gitu saja. Tak dihuraikan apa maksud konsep tersebut. Adakah ia sebuah simbol? Atau apa? Frust woi! Hampir 1300 mukasurat kau habiskan dakwat dengan cerita monolog yang entah apa-apa, lepas tu bahagian penting kau sentuh surface saja!7. Jadi, 1Q84 bukanlah sebuah karya hebat, grand, wow seperti yang dicanang-canangkan. It's just I partially enjoyed reading it. So-so. Dah lah hampir 2 minggu untuk habiskan bacaan. Kecewa sikitlah.8. Dengan melangkau terus ke 1Q84, meninggalkan novel-novel lain, expectation aku yang tinggi terhadap Murakami sebelum ini segera merosot mendadak. Mungkin ini adalah kesilapan maha besar yang aku buat.9. Aku kena berpuasa daripada Murakami selepas karya tebal ini. Baca buku-buku lain dahulu. Sebelum kembali kepada karya beliau kembali.P/s: Peminat Murakami atau sesiapa yang dah baca karya-karya beliau, apa pandangan korang?"
212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1045093-ademption,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5 stars rounded up to 3. Middle of the pack meta-Murakami: Lonely people doing chores and eating simple meals while listening to obscure classical music. Then, some weird things happen, which are never explained. This is normal in the murakami-verse. What's new in this novel is that these events are painstakingly narrated by Murakami from a step-by-step process point-of-view. Characters sweep their floor or make food and the reader is informed exactly how these tasks are performed, moment by tedious moment. Further, one of the characters is a writer who writes and talks about writing just like Murakami has previously talked about writing in interviews. So meta. Let me contain my excitement in this post-modern hall of mirrors.Also, 1Q84 is simile porn. There are many unnecessary, extended similes per page. However, speaking of porn, the sex scenes are well written and plentiful, which is a small saving grace.1Q84 reminds me of Medulla by Björk. You know, the album where she repeatedly sampled her voice until her voice could be substituted for instruments, which she then sang over. Her singing was made to sound like instruments, which she then sung over. So when you listen to a song from Medulla, it sounds like other Björk songs. But in reality, you are listening to her sing 50 times, and all that singing is shaped into one person singing over instruments. After Medulla, mostly everyone stopped listening to Björk, because they either didn't understand what she was doing or the experiment was too obscure and had little of the qualities that previously attracted her audience. She made at least two more albums after Medulla that people usually don't know about and certainly can't name without googling. There is a point where artists get so big, they attempt something too large/obscure and lose their audience. It is also probably the point where editors/producers back way off a star, because they don't want to harm the star's power. But the star is jumping the shark because s/he didn't have the grounding and constraints to struggle against that s/he had prior to stardom. 1Q84 is Murakami's Medulla moment."

Vì tôi giữ trong đầu cái ý tưởng, Murakami giống như một thiền sư, với các tác phẩm là các công án nhẹ đô, đi tìm một thứ ý nghĩa có hình hài rõ ràng là một điều không nên làm.Đối với tác phẩm này, hay như một số tác phẩm - chứa đầy nội dung siêu hình khác của anh Mu, tôi thực sự đã từng thưởng thức nó, đôi lúc vì các yếu tố sexy, các đoạn giao cấu vật vã (thằng đéo nào đọc Murakami lần đầu tiên cũng chỉ để tìm mấy đoạn có trai gái làm tình, tôi thì đến tận lần thứ 3 thứ 4), nhưng kể cả những đoạn siêu hình, hay không siêu hình khác tôi cũng vẫn thưởng thức được theo một cách hoàn toàn vô nghĩa.Đó là một điều tôi thích khi đọc Murakami, thỉnh thoảng tôi vẫn chợt nhiên nảy ra một vài ý nghĩa trong các đoạn văn của ông, - sau vài lần đọc - nhưng tôi lại thật sự thích trải nghiệm cái cảm giác thưởng thức mà chả cần thứ ý nghĩa mẹ gì níu kéo cả.Văn Murakami của tôi giống phụ nữ đẹp, cũng giống nhạc cổ điển, tôi chả hiểu phụ nữ gì hết nhưng chắc chắn tôi biết thưởng thức cùng họ vì con cu tôi hoàn toàn khỏe mạnh, và nếu rating cho phụ nữ thì chắc tôi luôn cho full sao (xin lỗi chị em nào cảm thấy khó chịu khi đọc đoạn này, làm ơn đừng report tôi). Vậy nên tôi ban 5 sao cho bất cứ tác phẩm nào của Murakami mà tôi đã có cơ hội thưởng thức, kể cả cuốn này mặc dù tôi chả hiểu ông viết cái mẹ gì hết.Có người nói 1Q84 là một sự đi xuống của Mu, vẫn giữ cách viết cũ, và đặc biệt dài dòng lê thê. Tôi lại nhớ đến câu nói của Mu mà tôi rất ưng, đại khái là ""tôi không thay đổi vì độc giả muốn tôi thay đổi"", sau cái lần ông tạch giải Nobel liên tọi. Theo tôi một tác giả lớn cần có một phong cách viết riêng mang một tinh hoa cốt tủy, và ứng vạn biến trong từng hoàn cảnh - giống như cách diễn xuất của Lenardo Dicapro và đặc biệt không cần giải Nobel. Thế nên trong cả hai trường hợp này (tạch nobel và 1q84 bị chê) tấm lòng của tôi dành cho ông vẫn không mảy may suy chuyển.Tôi hy vọng, sẽ được thưởng thức thêm nhiều chuyện ngoại tình, tình vụng trộm, truyện sex thần thoại nữa của ông trong nay mai, nên xin chúc ông luôn khỏe ."

I was legit in a long-term relationship with this novel and I can't really complain because it was HUGE. I guess every writer has to write an epic in their career and every reader has to make their way through a book of depth and girth, so this was his and this was also mine. It took me so long to read this novel because I really really took my time and became deeply invested and savoured every flavor presented to me. I guess the main question after all this time is — am I satisfied? Yes. I am. I'm totally satisfied with how the relationship turned out. It had all the elements I liked, all the longing and lust and beautiful locations, it was very detailed but not boring and when it was coming to a close I was actually shocked that we'd been through so much together and that we were so close. I vow to remain friends with this book - it was actually very good to me, comforting me through periods where I didn't know what to read or I only wanted to read one long chapter of something in my spare time. It provided great company. Although I cheated with other books from time to time; taking many others, using them and throwing them away, 1Q84 was loyal and waited in the wings for me. The story was beautiful; simple on the surface yet complicated when you peeled back the layers. It challenged me and rescued me from boredom, even if it caused the bubbling of boredom itself at times. I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward reading more of Murakami's work. I started here at the magnum opus before I read anything else of his and it's pushed me to want to read more of his writing. I really appreciate that the ending did not leave me hanging - I would have been pissed and this would have been a different review altogether, but he knew I was holding on and he came through and delivered a substantial ending. I recommend you read and take your time with this one, it definitely delivers."

The air has changed, the scene has changed. I have to adapt to this world-with-a-question-mark as soon as I can. Like an animal released into a new forest. In order to protect myself and serve, I have to learn the rules of this place and adapt myself to them.""Reading a work by Murakami is an experience like no other, especially an epic-length tome such as this one. 1Q84 is perhaps the epitome of magical realism that works successfully, most notably for me because Murakami's compelling, enthralling and absolutely mesmerizing writing style lends itself perfectly to telling this kind of tale. 1Q84 is an obvious riff on Orwell's classic, contrasting Big Brother from Orwell's book with the Little People in this novel. Murakami seamlessly blends elements of 1984 into his book, while telling a story that is wholly Murakami: a mix of dystopia, magic, a love story, and a grand mystery all wrapped up into one.I am often critical of Murakami's protagonists in some of his other books because they are generally the type that lack ambition or action to propel the story forward, but I did enjoy both protagonists in this tale for different reasons. The overall pacing of this book felt a little slow at times, but Murakami always gives you something as a reader to keep you going when the plot isn't moving forward quickly. As always, I enjoy Murakami's frequent musical references - mostly classical music in this book - as well as his transparently showing his literary influences. I don't know where this ranks in my ranking of Murakami's novels as I still have a lot to process from this book, but I will say that it's in the conversation for his best work. "

Ostensibly it is a fantasy about two sort-of-ordinary people living sort-of-simple lives in 1984 Tokyo. Aomame (AY-oh-MA-may) is a personal trainer with a small side gig, and Tengo (TAIN-go) is mathematics teacher and writer. As we slowly learn about their pasts and presents, we discover there are unseen connections between these two, plus ""the Dowager"" and a mysterious cult and a ghostwritten novel and a private investigator named Ushikawa and something that has changed the history of humanity and created a parallel world, 1Q84.For me, this was a rich novel. There are a lot of small asides on the main and secondary characters, fleshing them out ever more as the novel proceeds. But all the interesting bits -- the cult and ""the Leader"", the novel and the the fantasy elements and the mysterious Fee Collector, all get unsatisfying (or absent) resolutions, and a wave of the fairy tale wand ending.Unless, 1Q84: it's not you, it's me.

Here's why: It was just too long and repetitive. And it was just too out there and odd and unbelievable even for Murakami, and I'm able to suspend disbelief QUITE a bit. Also, the characters weren't as charming as past characters from other books. There was a lot that I liked, but these are the reasons I had to take away a star. And even with these complaints, I still give it four stars because the way Murakami writes is like nothing else. He really draws you in, even if the story is a weird and too-long tale about tiny, vicious people emerging from dead goat carcasses to wreak havoc on people in an alternate universe. This is my least favorite of all the work of Murakami that I've read, and I've read everything that I could get my hands on that has been translated into English. I've heard Murakami before say: writing short stories is a pleasure, writing novels is a challenge. Well this novel was flipping huge, like 900 pages. Maybe this was just too big a bite, i don't know. But he remains my favorite of all, able to touch my heart and soul like no other. "

It's not exactly mind-blowing, mind-bending, the most amazing novel or whatever, but rather it's like the water you drink; something quotidian, bland even to some, but it transforms inside you and become one with your mind and body. And it's up to each of us to decide what change we bring into this world, which indirectly, would be that water entity having a part in the evolution of the 'real' world.Update to come, maybe, when I get the chance to articulate more. In the meantime, a quote:
""It feels like I’m experiencing someone else’s dream. Like we’re simultaneously sharing feelings. But I can’t really grasp what it means to be simultaneous. Our feelings seem extremely close, but in reality there’s a considerable gap between us.""

I was very pleased to find on reading this that Murakami can actually write fantastically diverse and interesting female characters. Where books like Sputnik Sweetheart fell a bit flat when it came to depicting the inner world of women, 1Q84 succeeds, with as many interesting female characters as male ones. Much of the dialogue revolves around Aomame, one of two protagonists, and her female friends and colleagues. The other protagonist is Tengo, who is rewriting a novel originally penned by an elusive 17 year old girl called Fuka-Eri. Like Kafka on the Shore, this is a dual narrative, the three parts follow the two stories side by side and we slowly see links between the two. Not my very favourite Murakami, but this is one of the better ones I have read."

In fact it was originally a series of three novels which got packaged together later.I loved the heroine Aomame- a cool, detached assassin of abusive men.The writing is done in a simple but beautiful style that is often witty. The story has elements of fantasy, and you're kept wondering exactly who the 'Little People' are, and how a second moon appears in the sky. And there's a bit of sex in it too.The ending was somehow anti-climatic but HEA.This was a refreshing read for me"

It is also a story about a partially altered reality where 1984 1s turned in IQ84. The chapters alternate between Tengo, the male, and Aomame, the female.Normally I push myself to finish books that are 1000+ pages, but this book was an exception. I wanted to know what came next. Character development happens continually throughout the book. I found myself rooting for Tengo and Aomame to get together.

There’s a lot of blunt descriptions of sex and sex organs (particularly breasts), talk about food, weird dreams, discussion of music and literature and of course the compulsory cats. As always there is no tying up of all the loose ends in the conclusions, this is left to you. Like all Murakamis it is full of the practicalities of life. For example, there is a discussion of hiding out and the food you would need and how your personal taste and cooking ability would affect your food requirements. How would the food waste be disposed of? Etc. etc. For me this book was an exploration of fiction and what would happen if a story you wrote became reality. Would you as author be moulding this new world or would the actions and decisions of your characters ultimately be the biggest effect on this new world?It is also a story of lost love (romantic and family) and regret. At over a thousand pages it’s a very long book and as it was on audio I “read” it over the course of six to seven weeks. It’s a great book for that as it repeats the action from another character’s perspective again and again. This repetitiveness is something you are going to love or hate. I found it fascinating. The story changes somewhat when someone else is narrating and I was quite happy to relive these characters stories again and again. Recommended to anyone who already likes Murakami but at over a thousand pages maybe not suitable for a novice?"

On the bright side; The writing and the story is amazing, explicit and unique well it`s a Murakami after all. It`s mainly about two main characters, Aomame and tengo which are pulled into a new world of 1Q84 instead of the ordinary world of 1984 where two moons hang in the sky, the usual yellow bright moon and a smaller greenish one. They were in elemantry school together. One special encounter is what stayed with them even after 20 years apart, alone in a classroom where he was looking out of a window and Aomame came and held his hand as they stood perfectly still, the moon showing from the open window behind them in broad daylight. And their life is irreversibly changed forever. Now they`ve entered the world of 1Q84 where two moons hung in the sky, little people emerged from the dead, voices talk to specific people, air chrysalis is weaved and dohta emerges from within, voids are created by ones who pases to the other worlds, friends are mourned and fathers make their minds to leave the world and their own consciousness to make rounds in their own minds.“Ayumi had a great emptiness inside her, like a desert at the edge of the earth. You could try watering it all you wanted, but everything would be sucked down to the bottom of the world, leaving no trace of moisture. No life could take route there. Not even birds would fly over it. What had created such a wasteland inside Ayumi, only she herself knew. No, maybe not even Ayumi knew the true cause. But one of the biggest factors had to be twisted sexual desires that men around Ayumi had forced upon her.As if to build a fence around the fatal emptiness inside her, she had to create the sunny personality that she became.But if you peeled away the ornamental egos that she had built, there was only an abyss of nothingness and the intense thirst that came with it.Though she tried to forget it, the nothingness would visit her periodically on a lonely rainy afternoon, or at dawn when she woke from a nightmare.What she needed at such times was to be held by someone, anyone.” ― Haruki Murakami, 1Q84 "

Ook al is er nog twee strekkende meter aan werk van Murakami zo ongeveer.Afgelopen zomer begon ik in deel 1 van dit boek met een leesclub. Ik was meteen helemaal verslingerd aan de schrijfstijl, ik smulde van iedere zin. Dat is het hele boek zo gebleven.Tussendoor heb ik Norwegian Wood nog gelezen met een andere club. Daar miste ik het surrealisme in het verhaal, die kon me niet bekoren.Maar dit boek, oh wat een meesterwerk. Ik vind het prachtig hoe de verschillende verhaallijnen uitgediept worden en dat je het met elkaar verweven ziet geraken gedurende het boek (nouja eigenlijk de serie natuurlijk). Het is heel knap en mooi gedaan, er blijft geen enkel los eindje over - en er zijn Heel Veel touwtjes.Het derde del vond ik wat slepender in het midden dan de andere twee delen, en ik kwam ook niet echt nieuwe dingen uit de wereld tegen. Dat vond ik een beetje jammer, dat miste een sprankeltje dat het begin wel voor me had.Want het is een surrealistische en rare wereld die Murakami schept, maar wat vind ik het geweldig om te lezen. Als je denkt, wat bedoelt ze met het woord surrealistisch, ik vind het werk van Dalí daar een heel mooi voorbeeld van. Het is wat we kennen, maar dan net anders op een manier dat het anders en herkenbaar tegelijkertijd is. Bijzonder mooi.Maar, er zitten wat dingen in dit boek die ik te raar vindt. Vooral de rare dingen met een seksuele ondertoon deden toch wel met regelmaat mijn beide wenkbrauwen stijgen. Maar ondanks dat hoef ik geen moment na te denken over mijn rating van dit boek want ik ben er compleet van onder de indruk en helemaal aan het werk van deze auteur verslingerd geraakt. Op naar meer! (Ik heb er al twee in de kast staan, en ik mag pas een volgende kopen als ik die uit heb.. Anders koop ik meteen de hele plank op werk leeg als ik mezelf geen restricties opleg :P)Daarnaast zijn deze uitgaven ook erg fijn: floppy paperback met heel fijn papier. Leest erg prettig, de kleurtjes staan mooi naast elkaar in de kast én het is vriendelijk voor de portemonnee. Aanrader dus, en erg fijn van de uitgever dat ze zo'n mooie lijn hebben opgezet!"

""Don't let appearances fool you. There is always, as I said, only one reality.""A story of past relationship waiting to reunite, a religious cult scene and assassination, a wealthy dowager and her ambiguous mission, a literacy complot that lead to an unexpected absurd incident with intriguing characters, making it very interesting. I actually love how Murakami tells the story. I appreciate the chapter based on each characters, making it an easy read. On how the relationship between Tengo and Aomame goes-- I kind of expected the ending would be something like that. Fairly presented, very thoughtful and dream-like. I love reading the narrative from different views-- thrilling and gripping. That mysterious Q-- 'question mark', a world that bears a question as what Aomame said. I find it engaging-- differentiating in between reality and unreality, which of which or is it just a playful tale trying to trick me. Murakami and his magical realism writing-- I honestly can't get enough of it, the excitement and questions, it might be confusing and mind-boggling but on how it was philosophical written making it more exciting. There's few heartwarming moment that I love-- between Tengo and his dad, the sanatorium scene when as Tengo said his dad choose to quit life. It was my favorite among all, reading how Tengo keeps on talking and reading to his comatose dad. As well as when Tengo meets Aomame up on the slide below the two moons. Despite the thickness, that actually making me quite nervous-- my first thickest book ever, it was straightforward and awe-inspiring. A lovely fiction within an alternate universe. It might be draggy nearly the end or some would find it as repetitive narrative in Book 3, but reading all the stories in different perspectives somehow a bit enthralling. A good read nonetheless."

In other words, I expected a character with a low IQ to mutter strange but intriguing truths about life. Turns out, the title is 1Q84, as in the number 1. So it's really One Q 84. Great way to start off a book that takes us into a parallel universe. I'm listening to the audio book cd: 38 cds in all, my most ambitious listening yet. But don't worry, the local police have sent out an all-points bulletin to all pedestrians to watch out for a distracted driver. This book has two moons, little people, an alternative universe, sex, violence, and Sonny and Cher references. That pretty much covers every item on my requirements for novels to read list except for Zombies and Nicolas Cage references. But you can't have everything. There are stories within stories within stories here. It's like Charles Dickens on LSD, the Victorian novel meets Timothy Leary. Pretty incredible book, but not for everyone. I would certainly be surprised if Murakami never won the Nobel Prize for literature. But most of the time I can't figure out their picks anyway. Heck, I would've chosen Updike or McMurtry. Shows how much I know. This book is part Victorian novel, part love story, part fantasy, part thriller, part mystery, part crime story, part fairy tale, part morality play. I could go on, but I think you get the point. It has everything. But there is one more thing about it. I believe it can be read metaphorically as the imaginary place that all writers feel like they are going when they write. I know the scientific explanation of how writing occurs, and I believe it. But I ""feel"" like I am in another world when I write. A world with two moons. The bright yellow one that we are all familiar with. And the smaller green one of hope that all writers need to believe in."

Book 1 (April-June) NotesWHAT I LIKED: - I like that this is a puzzle I’m trying to solve. Especially when the time conspiracy theme starts rolling in…- I write picture books and graphics novels so the writing/publishing industry plotline was amusing. - I studied abroad in Japan, so I appreciated the setting. WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE: - The repetition: Like God, Tengo, stop telling me about weird ass fantasy about your mom and go see a therapist. - BRO, you totally wrote this: You can DEFINITELY tell a man wrote/translated this. Aomame’s voice/dialogue falls flat and cringy all throughout. I was thinking throughout- Is this what men think we think? Uh, no. Hard no. //File this under “male fantasies”. - Book 2 (July- September) NotesWHAT I LIKED: - The killing of characters that I wasn’t rooting for anyways. WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE: - I need to stop reading books where the plot revolves around religious zealots. - The narrators, though I totally understood why they were picked, used a dryer voice/muted emotions. So any “cat town” talk was just… really gross. Ew. Book 3 (October- December) Notes- What made me stop: Immaculate Conception. Seriously, wtf. - DNF (But peaked at plot notes elsewhere.)OVERALL: - When I told my BIL I was reading this book, it was obvious he wouldn’t of started reading Murakami with this pick. And he’s probably right, but I don’t know how motivated I’ll be to run to more of his catalog. - I should have listened to my gut and DNF-ed earlier. Like, though I bought a physical copy, I’m happy to donate because I feel icky just looking at it. - Style wise/world building wise- there were a few diamonds in the rough.

In the meantime, I read eight (or maybe it was nine) other novels.But finally, I have done it; I've finished the worst long novel I've ever read.My introduction to Murakami was pretty typical; I read Norwegian Wood and Kafka On the Shore because my Brooklyn-based then-girlfriend told me I should. I liked both books well enough; they were dreamy and meditative in their respective ways.Then I tried the Wind-Up Bird Chronicles and made it about halfway through before calling it quits and swearing off Mr. Murakami forever thanks to that novel's main character propensity for going to a hole and sitting in it and DOING FUCKING NOTHING for days at a time.But then came a recommendation that caused me to rethink my anti-Murakami policy. I decided I was being shortsighted and, possibly, a bumpkin. I mean, all these other people liked it...Those people are wrong. If 1Q84 had been 150 pages long, it would have been a tolerable adventure into a curiously mixed-up world. At 950 million pages (approx.), it became an exercise only in completion. There were 80-page sections of the book in which nothing appreciable happened. Tengo would like to find Aomame, Aomame would like to find Tengo, Ushikawa wants to find either one of them. BUT NO ONE ACTUALLY DID ANYTHING.Now, it is of course very possible that I have missed something important--that perhaps 1Q84 is more profound than I have the intellect to recognize. If that is the case, then it will be embarrassing when and if I ever meet Haruki Murakami. Because if that happens, I will ask him not only to return the time and money I spent on 1Q84, but also if he could please, for the sake of all of us, stop writing books and, instead, kindly fuck the fuck off."

236,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3947104-mark,Rating 1 out of 5,"1Q84: An Immense DisappointmentIt has become apparent Murakami has lost steam. His stories and style of writing are forced and repetitive, almost to the point of being a symptom of dementia. As with After Dark, 1Q84 has been lackluster and surmounted to nothing more than a waste of time.I do not recommend 1Q84. Save your money and time (this book is about a thousand pages on poor quality paper and binding... all which way about 30 pounds). The only reason I didn't sell the book to a used book store halfway through was my respect for Murakami... Sadly, the book only worsened to a point of being a vile droll non-story, degrading my almost idolistic worship for the author.Having finished the book, I have nothing but sympathy for the Japanese readers who read the first release that ended with the 2nd book. Murakami probably felt ""compelled"" to write more and produce the 3rd book because of the resulting backlash from the critics and readers. Knowing this, the 3rd book is an even more trite supplication that reads like hydrochoric acid sprayed as a fine mist onto your corneas.In all, 1Q84 appears to be a social experiment in testing the will of his readers. In this work, Murakami has played the role of a literary torturer imposing benevolence on his fanbase. If Murakami doesn't have the desire to write, he should hang up his hat and gracefully bow out instead of creating constipated byproducts like 1Q84.Still, Murakami has produced some amazing works and I apologize for my overly critical review of 1Q84. His short stories are spectacular and A Wild Sheep Chase is unmatched."
237,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann,Rating 4 out of 5,"Whatever topic he's addressing, Murakami is an excellent writer - one of those that it's just a pleasure to read, no matter what the content is. Still, I was delighted to hear that his latest could be described as 'fantasy,' since, well, I love fantasy.Originally, the book was published in 3 volumes. I'm glad that the English publisher didn't opt for that route (even though the book was heavy), as it's definitely one continuous work.An aspect of Murakami's work that I have ambiguous feelings about is that his creations are... ""floaty."" I really enjoy the dreamlike quality of his scenarios, but sometimes I wish his characters were more concrete. This aspect to his writing is very appropriate to the premise of 1Q84, where the main individuals, the sports instructor/hit woman Aomame, and the math instructor/novelist Tengo mysteriously find themselves in an alternate reality where there are two moons in the sky. It highlights the bizarre, surreal nature of their experiences, where fantastic elements from an odd teenager's novel turn out to be true, and an enigmatic cult offers threats...Perhaps it is only possible because Tengo and Aomame are themselves both odd, isolated individuals, but I couldn't help sometimes feeling that the surreal nature of the fantastic events would be thrown into sharper relief if the characters themselves were initially more rooted in our reality.The events of the novel are not fast-moving, but they hold the reader's interest. It's wise, however, to read it as an immersive experience, not a goal-oriented one. Don't expect any of your questions to be answered. Regardless of the lack of explanations, I did find the end satisfying."

By coincidence Aomane mentioned to been watching several times a ""double Moon"": some countries were able to watch the phenomenon of the ""Blood Moon"" (Jan 31, 2018), which is a total lunar eclipse, because of the reddish tinge the Full Moon takes on when fully eclipsed.

It’s not easy to read or talk about 1Q84, there are so many questions left unanswered and it’s one of the many charms of this brilliant example of contemporary literature.Murakami uses his unique tool to form parallel worlds, protagonists who strive to find meaning in a weirdly twisted universe and an inexistent novel central to the story: “Air Chrysalis” which creates a chaotic imbalance throughout the book. Fasten your seatbelts for more than a thousand pages of adventure that is worth every second you invest in. The space and time continuum buckles and bends for Aomame and Tengo and they somehow find themselves in a parallel world that includes two moons hanging up in the sky, a sensational novel written by an extraordinary girl, a religious cultish group that gives up everything to protect their beliefs and privacy, “Little People” who are the most powerful and mysterious beings in this ethereal universe. The story itself is quixotic and gripping, the narrative poignant and magnetic and it’s impossible to escape its gravity which pulls the reader in closer in each page. I can agree with most readers on the fact that the narrative is a little repetitive and the book itself could have been much shorter but it did not bother me at all, I just did not want this to end. A mind-bending story that is etched deep into my memory, a must-read for all literature lovers."

At the same time, this book is definitely a lot of effort for mediocre reward (borrowing a commenter's words here because they fit perfectly). In my opinion, it could and should have been a lot shorter. There is so much unnecessary detail to it and in the end, none of it really mattered. The ending is fine but nothing groundbreaking and book 3 in particular went by so slowly that all I cared about at that point was just finishing the book.I like Murakami's writing and his characters and I do think this book was good, but if you are not completely sure you want to invest yourself into those 1300 odd pages, I'm not sure it's worth it."

250,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8517539-j-c-greenway,Rating 1 out of 5,"Breasts. Some of us have them. Do you have them? How often do you think about them? (You may answer this question even if you are not thinking of your own.) Do you worry about their size, what people you meet think about their size, or whether sexual partners are turned off by their size? Are you always comparing your breasts to those of others? Do you find it impossible to enjoy even long-wished-for experiences because of thoughts like these? Even in moments of danger does your mind stray to the size of your potentially inadequate breasts?If the answer to these questions is ‘yes’ and you are a highly sought after physical therapist with a sideline in lucrative contract killings, you should probably do everyone a favour and stop obsessing. Call a plastic surgeon, use some of the pile of money you have sitting in a safety deposit box and get the blooming things done. Go up a cup size. Or two! Get the silhouette you have always known you deserved. And then we can get on with the rest of the book because you are one of two main characters in Haruki Murakami’s 1Q84 and frankly, there are bigger things to worry about than the size of your breasts (sorry… Not sorry.)In over 30 years of breast-owning, I have never thought about a pair as much as I have about Aomame’s. It feels cruel to a writer whose books I have enjoyed in the past, but someone needs to say: ‘Haruki, give it a rest, lad’. In his defence, it could be argued that Aomame is living out a suspended adolescence, where girls can fixate on such superficialities, and that when given the chance to change her appearance in order to evade capture more effectively, she declines. However, when this happens: 'Aomame mourned the deaths of these two friends deeply. It saddened her to think that these women were forever gone from the world. And she mourned their lovely breasts – breasts that had vanished without a trace.'The reaction is laughter rather than sorrow. Only the weight of the tome and an unreturned rental deposit on my apartment prevented me from throwing it across the room with great force, à la Dorothy Parker. It isn’t as if Mr Murakami is some crazed misogynist who doesn’t know any better. Countless examples prove that he can write women well, when he manages to lift his literary gaze higher than their chests. Aomame’s boss, the Dowager, is the kind of kick-ass old lady that everyone needs on their side: tracking down powerful abusers, maintaining a haven for their victims and dispensing quiet justice from a hothouse filled with butterflies. Fuka-Eri is a precocious literary talent, despite suffering from something akin to dyslexia. Yet her ‘beautifully developed’ full breasts are the feature that rates a mention almost every time the teenager appears. To add balance, so do her small, beautiful ears, if you are playing Haruki Murakami Bingo. Prepare to shout ‘full house!’What bedevils 1Q84 is the makings of a great story trapped somewhere within these pages, that unfortunately isn’t one you can read unless you want to get busy with a red pen, scissors and glue. Editorial input seems to have been limited to pats on the back while waiting for the Nobel Prize Committee to call. It is all the more frustrating because the amount of time that a book this size demands in investment would suggest that readers be rewarded in return. There are small glimmers of interest. The author is particularly good on the subject of cults, the origins of the Sakigake group are gripping and the menace and influence they are able to wield genuinely alarming. Underworld lawyer Ushikawa’s backhanded property dealings are a nod to the asset price bubble which is about to inflate, hobbling Japan’s economy for two decades and counting. The Little People are another frightening entity on first appearance, albeit later defanged and left woefully under-utilised. Tengo’s co-conspirator Komatsu has a great deal of interest to say on the nature of publishing stardom and the manipulation of the reading public, bestseller lists and the patrons of literary prizes (ahem). Unfortunately these potent elements are diluted in a soup of double moons, cats and small breasts, until it begins to feel like a parody.Perhaps the biggest letdown, remembering the many memorable characters that inhabit Murakami World, is the weakness of the two leads. It is difficult to feel the affection with which we regard, say, Watanabe’s meanderings into maturity in Norwegian Wood, for the romance of breast-obsessed Aomame and her opposite number, Tengo. Tengo could be an early forerunner of the much lamented ‘herbivore men’, except that he seems to be getting more than his fair share of the sex, which even by Murakami standards is decidedly icky. Haunted through his most intimate moments by a brief sexual memory from infancy concerning his mother, fantasising about the 10-year old Aomame, a sex scene with Fuka-Eri so cringe-y it was nominated for a Bad Sex award, Tengo could be a poster boy for abstinence. Vaginas are hairless and appear ‘freshly made’, in which case they are entered, or possess ‘thick, rich [pubic] hair’ in which case they are not. Murakami could be satirising the youth-fixated sexual landscape and its effect on women’s bodies – or he might just dig really young girls. And we are meant to root for Aomame and Tengo as star-cross’d lovers, despite him getting his rocks off with young girls and her prowling Roppongi bars to pick up balding middle-aged men. It is all a far cry from Orwell’s Junior Anti-Sex League.Much has been made of the inspiration provided by Nineteen Eighty-Four (nine in Japanese is ‘kyu’, hence the ‘Q’, the Little People as the opposite of Big Brother) but it is a struggle to note any deeper connection between the two. However, if Mr Murakami is looking to George Orwell for inspiration, there is this passage, from Why I Write: 'I will only say that of late years I have tried to write less picturesquely and more exactly. In any case I find that by the time you have perfected any style of writing, you have always outgrown it…'Perhaps Murakami has outgrown his own motifs, writing with more than half an eye on the judges in Stockholm blurred his focus, or it is possible that he went and sat in a well halfway through and the publishers got a ghost-writer to finish it from screwed up notes retrieved from the bin, or via a box marked ‘patent pending ACME MURAKAMI THEME GENERATOR’. Like Fuka-Eri’s work, Air Chrysalis, this is a book crying out for a determined editor backed by a ruthless publisher. In tests, 8 out of 10 talking cats said ‘It’s no Kafka on the Shore, now, is it, mate?’"
251,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10051075-abhinav,Rating 3 out of 5,"NOTE: Beware of ramblings that follow a Murakami novel - even more so when you've been told that it's his ultimate masterpiece. They are ramblings in the truest sense possible, if there was ever one.It's a Barnum and Bailey world,Just as phony as it can be,There is no point denying that ""1Q84"" is a work of indulgence. However, there are indeed a lot of things that strike as 'phony' in the alternate reality that comprises 9 months of the year 1Q84. By the time I reached the end of this big fat book, I couldn't help but feel an impending sense of disappointment - for a book that was supposed to be his ""long-awaited magnum opus"" is nowhere near justifying the phrase.""1Q84"" is the story of Tengo & Aomame - two people who seem to have formed a connection at the age of ten & even twenty years later, they are unable to keep each other out of their thoughts. The title suggests clearly that the story tips its hat to George Orwell's dystopian classic ""1984"" & it does have a number of vague references throughout the book, none more so than the unconvincing love story of our protagonists - similar to that of Winston & Julia's in Orwell's novel. However, one might be willing to condone that given it's just an homage & Murakami's characters live in a surrealistic world, where the rules of the real world do not apply.There are quite a few problems that plague this book throughout & the biggest of them is over-elaboration. But that must be imperative in a book of over 1000 pages, you might think? Yes, it is. Perhaps it might be to some extent when the story is told from a point-of-view narrative of two or three main characters, but Murakami goes completely overboard with that. No one needs a 24x7 insight into the mind of a person, no matter how interesting he or she is.Also, when we are talking about elaboration, perhaps Murakami could've afforded a proper explanation in a few of those many pages for dispensing with a few characters when required than them being ""irretrievably lost"", disappearing for once & for all or killed in ""mysterious circumstances"" with no clue as to how the murder was committed. ""Use your brains dummy, you're reading Murakami"", apparently said no one.And finally we come to the Little People. Now this bunch of magical creatures & a religious group called Sakigake (and maybe even Tengo's editor) serve as Big Brother-like figures in the plot, but unlike the original Big Brother their presence never looms large in the background, always shadowing the actions of our protagonists. Even the tenacious private investigator Ushikawa - whose character gains more traction in the final book - only raises the thrill quotient a little bit without actually terrifying the reader. Honestly, how can one be awed one bit by the so-called Little People when all they say most of the time when they make an appearance is ""ho, ho""?But it wouldn't be make-believeIf you believed in me.Believe me Murakami san, I tried really hard to believe in you. And the fact that I finished this tome is the biggest proof of that. The story did have its moments (and they were wonderful, you bet) but I came very close to losing that faith when Book Three seemed to drag on endlessly at times. When you were being so enigmatic & leaving things open to interpretation, I really tried to recreate my own version of events but eventually it was tiring & some of it was simply not worth the hassle.That being said, the plot though lacking in crispness was for most parts engaging & a good amount of praise must be accorded to a memorable cast of characters (esp. Fuka-Eri, Komatsu, the Leader, the Dowager & Tamaru) I really cared about. And as far the ending is concerned, it couldn't have come full circle any better - too bad I can't say that about some other parts of the story.So I'm going for 3 & a half stars (earlier rating of 4 was far too generous) for Haruki Murakami's ""1Q84"". The book might be Murakami's most magnitudinous work literally, but it certainly doesn't stand high on the scale of literary magnitude compared to some of his earlier works like ""Kafka on the Shore"". Recommended only for fans of the author - read it when you have a lot of time to spare & I just hope that when you eventually hit the ground after falling through the endless rabbit hole, the loud thud of disappointment doesn't hurt too much."

 “I might end up never firing the pistol. Contrary to Chekhov’s principle.”“That’s fine, too,” Tamaru said. “Nothing could be better than not firing it. We’re drawing close to the end of the twentieth century. Things are different from back in Chekhov’s time. No more horse-drawn carriages, no more women in corsets. Somehow the world survived the Nazis, the atomic bomb, and modern music. Even the way novels are composed has changed drastically. So it’s nothing to worry about.""
This quotation just about sums up the book - although innovative and beautifully written definitely not my cup of tea; review to come.-------------------------------------------------------------------------The more I think about this book the less I like its execution.This is perhaps the most ambitious Murakami book I have read, and I have read a good portion of them. It’s too much and at the same time not enough: ambiguity is a must for Murakami’s magical realism but this one is maybe one of his rare ones where I don’t want to think about it after I am done with reading. On the other hand, it encompasses so many topics, the hypocrisy of the literary world, religion (a lot of this one), love, individuality, politics(a lot of parallels with Orwell’s 1984) sci-fi elements (parallel worlds), sexism, the nature of “good” and “evil”, the meaningless existence that we give purpose to, etc.Maybe the only way to consume this book and enjoy it is while listening to Bach’s The Well-Tempered Clavier and Goldberg Variations which the structure of the novel is referring. Or, more possibly, this one, in all of its wonderful complexity was too much for me and definitely not my cup of tea."
253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3359025-jigar-brahmbhatt,Rating 2 out of 5,"So I took around three years to finish this book. The longest I had spent reading a Murakami novel was 2 months for Wind-up Bird (and it was jolly good fun)... Anyhow, 1Q84 is a mediocre book, pumped up by repetitive, stupefying episodes. The dialogues are plain and the characters don't seem to have a life outside of the circumstances Murakami puts them through, which is bad because you hardly think of them the way you think of Toru or Midori. Fact is, the characters in this novel can easily be termed as ""Murakami Stock Characters"". The logic seems to be like this: if in confusion, pull out a pessimist, lonely male who lives alone, has causal, passion-less sex, and allow him the luxury to get obsessed about something. Viola! Also, to make it different, give him a wound from the past. That's it. Nice and easy. Not to say the characterization here is bad, but everything about this book, the two moons, the little people, the cultish leader, the people who try to kill him - everything looks farcical, as if Murakami began by the intention to pull off one big joke but later got carried away. The idea of two lovers eternally trying to meet is a good one and the structure of the novel is neat but what drags are the events. I am yet to encounter a writer who can handle parallel narratives so effortlessly (Hard-boiled Wonderland... still stands tall in my mind), but the episodes and the overall plot here didn't work at all. The so-called surrealism of 1Q84 falls flat on the face. Murakami is at his best when a first-person narrator takes you on a chilled-out ride through an urban landscape and before you know it there are cursive slips into the surreal. The effect comes out of the Carver-like sparseness of prose that slowly builds a sense of urban ennui, and because the narrators have a lot of free time on their own they have the luxury to engage in curious, eccentric mini-adventures; episodes that take their own sweet time in the lifespan of the novel - things that have nothing to do with the main plot, like entering an unused well and sitting there for hours, buying a lifetime supply of rubber-bands on whim, cooking spaghetti while listening to jazz music, engaging in long conversations with a teenage girl...these cursory episodes, because they slow down the reader and because their inherent boredom is so constant and engaging, bring forth a new sort of ""cool"". And this slowness is required for the slips into the surreal to work effectively, the reason being that the violence of the subconscious is shocking/surprising when the reader comes to it through programmed stillness. It is already done so well in the previous novels that one wonders about the intricate structuring involved in their construction. Consider how ""Dance Dance Dance"" begins:""I often dream about the Dolphin Hotel. In these dreams, I am there, implicated in some sort of ongoing circumstance. All indications are that I belong to this dream continuity. The Dolphin Hotel is distorted, much too narrow. It seems more like a long, covered bridge. A bridge stretching endlessly through time. And there I am, in the middle of it. Someone else is there too, crying.""It may appear ordinary on initial gaze, but page after page of such measured sentences does something to your brain. ""Addictive"" is a word often used for his writing, and I believe it comes out of the slowness made bearable by the narrator's whims and his knowing sadness. This shimmering narrative device works because it takes the reader along on a ride. The reader goes where the first person narrator goes and knows only what the narrator knows, a la Raymond Chandler (Murakami's obvious inspiration) - the joy of reading comes from the joy of discovery. Whereas in 1Q84 one feels merely being informed about a lot of tedious things. His past, her past, that girl's past, this man's past...and it is so saturating after some pages that you grow wise while reading it and you suddenly realize why you loved the early Murakami in the first place. Loose the easy-going-ness of the first person account and you loose what it means to be a Murakami fan!"

Makinelere bağlı olarak yaşamını sürdürmeye çalışan bir adamı. Artık ölmek istiyorum, beni rahat bırakın diyen bir adamı. Kalbi atıyor, evet. Nefes alıyor, evet. Ama sohbet etmiyor, birşey anlatmıyor, kalkıp dans etmiyor. Raflarda anlatacak çok şeyi varmış gibi duran, kalınlığı ile ilgimi cezbetmiş olan bu tuğla, klasik bir Murakami eseri.Klasik bir Murakami eseri derken Norwegian Wood, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle ve Kafka on the Shore'u da okumuş biri olarak söylüyorum. Yaşayan bir kitaptan beklediğiniz giriş, gelişme ve sonuç yine yok. Gelişme, gelişme, gelişme var onun yerine. Kitap yarıdan başlıyor, neredeyse hiçbir şeye cevap vermeyerek yarıda bitiyor. Siz bu arada anlamsız netlikteki cinsel gelişmeleri okuyorsunuz, geçip giden ve hikayeye etkisi bulunmayan karakterlerin okudukları okulları, yedikleri yemekleri, alışkanlıklarını okuyorsunuz. Ama gelin görün ki her zamanki gibi hikaye hiçbirşey anlatmıyor.Öncüler'e ne oldu, Fukaeri nerede, Little People ne yaptı hiçbirinin yanıtı yok!Bu arada 1.256 yazmak zor tabi. Ama belki aşağıdaki gibi diyaloglar biraz işi kolaylaştırmıştır;- Geri gelmeyecek misin diye sordu Tengo - Geri gelmeyecek miyim diye tekrarladı Fukaeri boş gözlerle - Geri gelmeyecek olan annesini düşündü Tengo. - Bir süre sonra geri gelmeyeceğim dedi Fukaeri - İşte o zaman Tengo Fukaeri'nin geri gelmeyeceğini anladı - Sen geri gelmeyeceksen ben de geri gitmeyeceğim dedi Tengo - Aynı annesinin fanilası sıyrılmış memesini emen babası olmayan adamın geri gelmediği gibi 2 bölüm sonra (çünkü bir bölüm sonra Aomame var) - Tengo gitmiş, Fukaeri geri gelmemişti. Tengo yaptıkları konuşmayı hatırladı. Geri gelmeyecek misin diye sormuştu ve Fukaeri geri gelmeyecek miyim diye tekrarlamıştı.Bu dört kitabın özetinde, bir Murakami kitabı yazma formülü geliştirdim;- İki ana - üç yan karakter- Birkaç çarpıcı enstantane (gilyaklar, little people)- Bir miktar ensest ilişki, cinsel detaylar- Üç-dört müzik eseri veya film- Konuyla uzaktan yakından ilgisi olmayan detaylar- Tarihsel bir olay- Her bölüm özetSonuç olarak 1 ayımı alan bu güzide kitap yerine 3 tane sürükleyici, akıcı, anlamı olan kitap bitirebilirdim. Hayatımdan giden 1.256 sayfa. Geri gelmeyecek bir aydı bu kitap."

Mình đã đọc hết 3 quyển trong series này, điểm làm mình thích nhất thì có nhiều nhưng chỉ gói gọn trong vài điều sau: Về tựa đề thì chắc chắn Murakami inspired từ George Orwell rồi, nhưng ông vẽ ra một thế giới trong đó...chẳng có gì khác thế giới này (không như thế giới trong 1984, cũng lấy chất liệu hiện thực nhưng xây dựng mộtt hế giới hư cấu), chẳng qua có khác thì khác trong tâm trí của các nhân vật, và chỉ khác ở... số lượng mặt trăng mà thôi! (cái này đọc rồi sẽ hay)Murakami sử dụng thủ pháp đan xen hoán đổi giữa các tuyến nhân vật chính (hai tập đầu chỉ có hai, tập ba có thêm một nhân vật khác) vốn không mới lạ gì với các fan Murakami, nhưng việc ông nâng tầm lên đan xen 3 ngôi kể làm độc giả đọc cũng hơi vất vả, bên cạnh đó càng chứng tỏ tài hoa của ông. Việc thay đổi ngôi kể cũng góp phần tăng chất giả trinh thám cho toàn bộ tác phẩm: nó giống như cảm giác lâng lâng khi đọc Tên tôi là đỏ vậy. Về nội dung mình sẽ không đề cập nhiều (nó hơi giống Cô gái đến từ hôm qua đó haha) nhưng mình thích cách ông xây dựng cốt truyện: nhẹ nhàng, không nhiều twist nhưng hấp dẫn độc giả từ đầu chí cuối không bị lê thê. Thêm một cái hay nữa là ông sử dụng Easter Eggs rất nhiều. Ngay cả tuyến nhân vật thứ 3 trong tập 3 (mới xuất hiện) cũng là một nhân vật mang trực tiếp từ một quyển khác của ông vào, nếu như trong quyển ấy nhân vật này lặn mất tăm không rõ tung tích thì trong quyển này ông đã cho độc giả biết kết cục của nhân vật này ra sao. Tuy vậy bạn nào hơi ác cảm với nạn ấu dâm nên đọc với sự đánh giá khách quan vì biết đâu bạn sẽ hơi...dị ứng ở một số trường đoạn. Nói tóm lại là quyển này rất đáng đọc, hãy đọc ít nhất một lần trong đời 😁"

257,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88095891-isabel,Rating 1 out of 5,"Ich bin einfach nur fassungslos, dass dieses furchtbare Buch von allen Zeitungen und so vielen Lesern gehypt und als Meisterwerk deklariert wird. Es ist einfach nur unglaublich langweilig und nach über 1.000 Seiten gibt es noch nicht einmal eine geniale Auflösung, die einen für die erlittenen Qualen entschuldigen würde (und ich suche wirklich in jedem Buch nach irgendeinem tieferen Sinn). Haruki Murakami benutzt die Anspielung auf George Orwells geniale Dystopie 1984 bewusst, sodass ich eine neue zeitgemäßere Dystopie erwartet habe. Dem ist jedoch nicht so. Außerdem finde ich die ständigen sexuellen Anspielungen in Bezug auf minderjährige Mädchen einfach nur widerlich. Erst dachte ich noch, dass das Buch sich bewusst gegen Kindesmissbrauch einsetzt, aber am Ende werden selbst diese abscheulichen Taten in gewisser Weise zwar nicht direkt gerechtfertigt, aber mit dem logischen Verlauf der Geschichte erklärt und als naturgegeben hingenommen. Weiterhin ist die Geschichte voller Kitsch und Pathos: Tengo und Aomame haben sich mit zehn Jahren einmal kurz die Hände gehalten und lieben sich seit 20 Jahren ohne sich je wieder zu sehen? Ohne überhaupt mal miteinander zu sprechen? Sein Ernst? Auch wenn es vielleicht als Parodie gemeint sein soll... Meine Vermutung, warum dieses Buch so berühmt ist: Als ein bekannter Autor kann er sich einfach alles erlauben und selbst der größte Quatsch wird als Meisterwerk angenommen. Ich werde dennoch weitere Werke von ihm lesen, da ich die Hoffnung noch nicht verloren haben, den meisterhaften Autoren zu entdecken, den so viele in ihm sehen."
258,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41578933-p,Rating 3 out of 5,"Murakami's novels are pure wonder when they work for you and utter balderdash when they don't. They could easily be pages filled with nonsensical events in an endless loop when you aren't able to establish the emotional connection. Kafka on the Shore worked out for me and Wind-up Bird Chronicle didn't. I was pleasantly mystified throughout the former and super perplexed with the latter. 1Q84 is a bit of both. It takes super long for the novel to hook you in and it finally happens after 300 or so pages. It's divided into books one, two and three. The best part of the book when it's all pure magic is from the second half of Book One to two-thirds of Book Two. After that it's all mechanically repetitive, inconsequential drivel. For this book to be stretched to 1,300 pages it would seem that Murakami wrote a perfectly crisp, wonderfully weird novel at 600 pages and because he wanted to be known for writing a LONG novel, he injected fat and fat and more fat into it until it grew to the uber-corpulent mega-mammoth he wanted it to be. My advice would be to persist till the end of Book Two and finally turn to the last chapter and be done with it. It's not like Murakami is providing any closure at the end. All questions are left unanswered as usual and meticulously constructed narrative tracks are abandoned halfway for no good reason.This inconsistent, obese, partially lazy book might've well been the best of Murakami had it been scrutinized by an editor like Komatsu."
259,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2445786-olivia,Rating 3 out of 5,"I've only ever read one Murakami and I clearly remember falling in love with the way he writes. It was a revelation. Compared to that experience 1Q84 is a disappointment and I can't quite explain why. Possibly because I was only 18 years old and back then easily impressed by good books? Or maybe because I read it in German and this one in English? Maybe it's the translation.1Q84 is an intriguing book, but I neither enjoyed the way it all comes together, nor the length of it. In fact I almost gave up on it about halfway through. It's easy to be sucked into the story at first. Each chapter alternates between the points of view of the two main characters and it takes a long time before the connection becomes clear. Aomame is full of surprises throughout the first half, whilst Tengo doesn't seem to have that many layers. Murakami paints interesting characters, talks a lot about food and the sex scenes are incredibly awkward (but he sure knows how to describe breasts.) He also doesn't fully explain a lot of magical things that are happening throughout the plot, to the point where 1Q84 left me with too many questions and not enough answers.Maybe this wasn't the right book to pick up. Maybe I need to go back and read his other works to find that feeling I had, when I read him for the first time. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to someone who hasn't read Murakami before. "
260,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,Rating 4 out of 5,"1Q84 is the story of two people, Tengo and Aomame, living in Tokyo 1984. Tengo is a writer and part-time math teacher who is asked to ghost write for a mysterious young lady. Aomame is a fitness instructer who is recruited by a client to carry out special requests. How do they meet up/connect? The plotline is fascinating and original even though it is still peppered with Murakami-isms; cats, love, cooking, the moon. It is a great Murakami story, up there with the best, however there are certain negatives that detract from this greatness.1Q84 (I started calling it 'Q-teen eighty four') is a trilogy, but I read it as a collected volume. Each book is not distinct and really should have been published as one volume. I'm pretty forgiving for plotline meandering and going with the flow, but even to me the third book seemed padded. Not much happens between pages 750-950 and I imagine that if you are not a fan this would massively piss you off.Overall I loved the story, it just needed a good editing. I would not recommend it for first time Murakami readers, I'd only recommend it for fans. Go and read 'Kafka on the Shore', 'Norwegian Wood' and my favourite 'The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle' first. If you are hankering for more then tackle '1Q84'."

SF is not a genre that I have much affection for, yet I love Murakami's books.I find that I'm usually drawn to characters with human qualities. Many of Murakami's characters have almost otherworldly traits (though at the same time they have human qualities), yet I find myself connecting with many of them.If 1Q84... had been written during, say the 1860s, I can imagine it having been serialized in a monthly magazine with readers eagerly awaiting the next episode.Murakami writes some great love stories.

Yeah, it’s pretty much impossible to summarize this VERY LONG book with any sort of conciseness, but 1Q84 is certainly the kind of place a reader can get lost in, both in its construction and its characters. I fell under the spell of this book early on and it didn’t abate until I finished the last page. Very good."

The story unfolds in Tokyo during the year 1984 and introduces two main characters: Aomame, a fitness instructor and assassin, and Tengo, a writer and math tutor. As they navigate this altered world, marked by two moons in the sky and strange occurrences, their paths converge in ways they couldn't have imagined. Murakami weaves a complex tapestry of love, mystery, and a struggle against a dystopian cult, all set in a meticulously crafted parallel world.Pros:- 👍 Richly Imagined World: Murakami creates a detailed and immersive parallel universe that captivates the imagination.- 👍 Complex Characters: The protagonists are deeply developed, with compelling backstories and emotional depth.- 👍 Intricate Plotting: The novel is full of unexpected twists and turns, keeping the reader engaged and curious.- 👍 Thought-Provoking Themes: Murakami explores profound themes such as the nature of reality, love, and the impact of past actions.Cons:- 👎 Lengthy and Dense: The novel's considerable length and detailed narrative can be daunting for some readers.- 👎 Pacing Issues: Some parts of the book may feel slow, with prolonged stretches focusing on minute details.- 👎 Complex Narrative Structure: The alternating viewpoints and complex storyline might be confusing at times.- 👎 Surreal Elements: The blend of fantasy and reality may not appeal to readers who prefer more straightforward storytelling.Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆""1Q84"" earns a solid 4 out of 5 stars.

وقد أحاطتني شخصيات ماروكامي كالعادة في شرنقتها ووجدت في أحزانها سلوى لأحزاني، وأعتقد أن ماروكامي كاتب جيد يستطيع العمل على مشروعاته بصبر ودأب وألمعية لماحة، فهو يضع تفصيلًا لكل ملمح من ملامح شخصياته وتشابكها معًا في الأحداث، يبدأ أولًا في تفكيك كل شخصية أمامك على الورق، ثم بعد أن تستقر تلك الشخصيات المنفردة في عقلك تبدأ مصائرهم في الدخول في دوائر بعضهم البعض حتى تشعر بالحيرة من تطور الأحداث وتسارعها المتلاحق في وعيك الباطن، وكثير من الروائيين الآن يعكف على مشروع روائي ذو ملمح تاريخي من أجل أن يصير عمله ذا قيمة كروايات ألف شافاق على سبيل المثال، تثير من خلال التاريخ قضية ما مختلف عليها لتطرحها من وجهة نظرها، لكن ماروكامي نوع مختلف تمامًا، فرواياته مشاريع قائمة بالفعل لكنها مزيج من فلسفة تناسخ الأرواح وعصرانية اليابان الحديثة وفلسفة الجريمة دون إغفال الجانب الإيروتيكي في رواياته الأخيرة على الأخص ومنها هذه الرواية، وأعتقد أن أي تفصيلة صغيرة يوردها ماروكامي في رواياته يكون لها تعلق بالأحداث التالية حتى لو نساها القارئ، وأرى في هذا ملمح من أدب الروائية العجيبة أجاثا كريستي وسلسلة شرلوك هولمز الشهيرة لسير آرثر كونان دويل، فكل شيء يرد في القصة سيكون له ارتباط بسير الأحداث مهما دق أو ورد ذكره هامشيًا أثناء القراءة، وهذا ما وجدته في هذا المشروع الرحب الذي بدأه الكاتب في هذه السلسلة بتلك الرواية، وهذه الرواية مجرد تمهيد لجزء آخر متمم فيه عقدة الأحداث وحل تلك العقدة، أو تركها كما هي دون حل كما فعل في روايته السابقة التي قرأتها مؤخرًا أيضًا ""رقص رقص رقص""، في هذه الرواية شخصيتان رئيستان، ""تنجو"" الكاتب الذي يتورط في صياغة مشروع رواية لمراهقة ناشئة في عالم الكتابة، و""أومامه"" امرأة في منتصف عمرها تتجه لأن تكون قاتلة متسلسلة لصالح أرملة ثرية تميل إلى مساعدة النساء اللاتي يعانين من العنف المنزلي، كل منهما ""تنجو"" و""أومامه"" مثقل بتجارب عائلية قاسية قضت على طفولته واضطرته للانعزال في برجه العاجي، كل منهما يميل للتجارب الجنسية الشاذة حسب رؤية ماروكامي الفلسفية لأزمة الإنسان الياباني المعاصر بعد تخليه عن عاداتها الشرقية واتجاهه الحداثي العلماني العولمي، فصول الرواية مقسمة بالتساوي بين هاتين الشخصيتين، ويسير بك ماروكامي برفق بين عالمي كل من تنجو وأومامه فصلًا بفصل حتى يصل في آخر صفحات هذا الجزء الأول لأول ملمح من ترابط الأحداث وتشابك دائرتي أبطال القصة، أعتقد أنكم لن تدركوا معنى هذه الكلمات إلا بعد قراءة الرواية الدسمة، هي رواية مشوقة للغاية، هذا الرجل كاتب مثير للإعجاب لاشك، لكن شبق اللحظات الجنسية لكل من أبطال الرواية والوصف الفضائحي للحظات الفراش الحميمة وذروة المعاشرة وألاعيب الفراش هي ما يستجير منه قارئ مثلي يعاني من ألم الحاجة للجنس، ولا أعلم لمَ هذا التطرف الغريب في هذه الرواية على وجه الخصوص في إبراز هذه النزعة الإيروتيكية الفضائحية المفاجئة، ولكن لامبالاة ماروكامي في وصف معاشرة تنجو لامرأة متزوجة ذات أسرة وأولاد وخيانتها لزوجها مع ""تنجو"" بحجة عدم الإشباع الجنسي من قبل زوجها أمر مستهجن في تلك الرواية ولا أعلم ما هدف ماروكامي منه، ونظرة ماروكامي التضامنية مع ممارسات السحاق في حوار كل من ""أومامه"" وصديقتها ""أوتامي""، ووصف ""أومامه"" للحارس ""تامارا"" مثلي الجنس كلاهما أمر غريب جدًا، لكنها تميل لتأطير نظرة ماروكامي العلمانية البحتة ووضعها ضمن سياق رواياته، فالكاتب يضع وجهة نظره من هذه القضايا من خلال شخصيات روايته دونما حرج، الرواية أثارت إعجابي رغم كل هذا الوسخ، وقد أنهيتها تقريبًا في ثلاثة أيام من القراءة المتواصلة، ورغم أن نهايتها ما زالت معلقة فقد أشبعت نهمي للغاية، وقد بدأت في غيرها مباشرة بعد القراءة، مرجئًا فكرة الذهاب للمعرض لأي دعوة من صديق للرفقة رغم تعاساتي الحياتية، لا أعلم ماذا أفعل يا سادة، حقيقةً أنا في حيرة كل يوم، قال الشاعر محمد إقبال: ""خُذوا إيمانَ إبراهيمَ تَنْبُتْ .. لكم في النَّارِ جَنَّاتُ النَّعِيمِ""، وقد وجدتني في عزلتي أتردى في حيرتي دركات ودركات، قال ""ناجي"" في إحدى قصائده البديعة: ""حان حرمانى ونادانى النذير = ما الذي أعددت لي قبل المسير، زمنى ضاع وما أنصفتنى = زادى الأول كالزاد الأخير"".. إلى الله المشتكى، ""وسهّدني علمي بما تفعلُ النّوى * وأنكَ عنّي لا محالَةَ راحلُ"".. ومما ورد على لسان علي بن أبي طالب رضي الله عنه ""يأتي على الناس زمان تكون العافية فيه عشرة أجزاء تسعة منها في اعتزال الناس، وواحدة في الصمت"".. يا رأسي.. { رَبَّنَا اكْشِفْ عَنَّا الْعَذَابَ إِنَّا مُؤْمِنُونَ} [الدخان: 12]."

And tonight I am Rocky dancing at the top of those steps, people!!The first 2/3 went fairly smoothly for me. This is my first Murakami and I find his cult-like status intriguing. The last third I slowed down my dedication, and my helpful e-reader told me at one point that I had 82% left, and 4 hours of reading to go. Sometimes ebooks can trick you and seem longer or shorter than you expect. Not so with 1Q84. You feel every minute.Murakami writes quite true to life; detailed yet no-nonsense: What characters prepared themselves for meals, performing sexual acts (not in a salacious, sexy way, really, but merely as a fact of life, maybe?), long, sometimes confusing conversations, or internal musings, etc.I don’t think I loved it, but I liked the writing style, and the characters. This was like finishing a too-big piece of pie; it was yummy, but too much at one time and I’m feeling over-full. And confused. And sleepy. Dopey... Grumpy... it brings all the dwarves out, basically.Whatever. I’m still Rocky dancing at the top. *drops the ebook. Walks away*"

A Weirdly Wonderful Wandering
Tengo is a former math-prodigy turned part time teacher and novelist who agrees to ghostwrite a novel by a stirringly beautiful 17 year old girl Fuka-Eri. Aomame is a martial arts instructor and physiotherapist who undertakes assassination missions on the side under the directions of a mysterious dowager. Amongst these two protagonists who are somehow linked, a mysterious cult named “Sakigake” is gaining power and influence in Japan, all happening in the parallel reality of 1Q84, the “Q” standing for “question mark”.This book is a monster at around 1,000 pages. But don't worry - this review is not as long as the book. 1Q84 is my third Murakami book, having read Norwegian Wood and Kafka on the Shore. Typically, the writing is enchantingly simple and subtly captivating so that you really feel lost in this book’s world of 1Q84, being transported to another reality, almost belonging there. This mystical world feels so real with gripping prose, describing with ease a world with two moons in the sky, the “little people”, an unnerving authoritarian cult, and supernatural forces at play. Due to its length, it wasn’t quite as absorbing as his other works, the repeated overly detailed descriptions of the mundane do stagnate the novel a little. Many have commented that surprisingly little actually happens in the 1,000 pages. I agree – there is very little progress, but lots of meandering and circling along the way. With the narrative flitting mostly between the two protagonists – Aomame and Tengo, sometimes the same time frame is repeated from different perspectives. This makes the events seem claustrophobic so that a very short period of time is painstakingly over-analysed.Murakami explores several heavy themes such as suicide, childhood abuse, rape, and sentimentality along with his paradigm motif of loneliness. We experience the confusion and troubled minds of the protagonists as they deal with these issues and seek some sense in this mad world of 1Q84. I found myself easily absorbed in the thoughts and wonderings of Tengo and Aomame.The novel does not have a clear sense of direction throughout. I’ve heard that Murakami himself does not know what will happen to his characters when he first embarks on writing a novel. Reading 1Q84 is like taking a long leisurely walk without much reason or purpose, just because. At first you might just want to walk a few miles, but soon end up lost in your surroundings, there are so many lovely little intricacies you just want to pause and take stock of. Then you explore further, deeper and before you know it, you’ve been walking for hours and days, with no real destination, enjoying the journey for its own sake.There isn’t a real sense of finality to the book too. Going back to my walk analogy, it’s as if after a few weeks of just walking and observing, the wanderer decides suddenly that his current location should be his destination for now. Little is resolved and we are left with more questions and curiosity than we started with.If an author succeeded in writing a story 'put together in an exceptionally interesting way' that 'carries the reader along to the very end' who could possibly call such a writer 'lazy'.Even if the novel does stand with a “deliberately cryptic posture”, I can’t argue with this and 1,000 pages is definitely not lazy. If you make it through, you are in for a wonderful voyage into Murakami’s surreal world blurring reality. You may even look up the moon at night, to check which reality you are in, just in case.Additional comments after 2nd reading - 29/05/15The Town of Cats is a microcosm of the 1Q84 world Tengo and Aomame find themselves in. Reading through 1Q84 is like travelling to a land faraway with many strange things. It is a world to get lost in and wander aimlessly until you discover what you were looking for. Travel far enough and you'll find yourself, but linger too long, and you find yourself irretrievably lost in the Town of Cats."
275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5973086-ruby-tombstone-lives,Rating 4 out of 5,"NOTE: There is a lengthier review to come as I have a lot to say about this book. I made copious notes while reading it, but it may take a little while to review them as I recorded them on a Kindle. Apparently the Kindle developers weren't made aware that people might actually want to one day retrieve, organise or in any way whatsoever utilise the notes they take. It's an easy mistake to make. If you're Amazon.In the meantime, I'll say that 1Q84 is a good book, if not a truly great one. It's by far the most accessible and the most structured Murakami book I've come across. It was by no means a difficult read, and the chapters were short, tight and well edited. At times, however, I suspected those elements to be part of a very clever, very cynical marketing approach designed to target mainstream English-speaking audiences. Make no mistake, the marketing approach for this book worked - 1Q84 broke all sorts of records before it had even been released. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since we have this book to thank (at least in part) for a recent resurgence in the popularity of ""real"" paper-and-ink books. I did feel that the pandering was excessive though, and it came at the price of losing that intangible quality that makes Murakami's other books so enjoyable.I should also point out that I was lucky enough to have the beautiful hardcover omnibus edition of all three books. The attention to detail in this edition is amazing, right down to the fonts and page numbering. I would highly recommend getting your hands on a copy if you're in any way unsure why people still read paper-and-ink books. My boyfriend earned big points for that birthday present. The other good thing about having this edition is that, unlike Japanese readers, I knew going into it that I would be making a 1,000 page commitment, and that the story would be in 3 parts. The latter is important, as I would be writing a very different review had I read Books 1&2 only. Knowing at the end of Book 2 that there is another part to the story makes all the difference in the world as to your understanding of the plot.... and that's all I'm going to say on that point.Prior to reading 1Q84, I came across an interesting article in The Guardian in which Murakami says the book is ""a riff on Orwell's 1984"". I took this information seriously, going so far as to read 1984 immediately beforehand so that no reference would go unnoticed. Let me make it absolutely clear that Murakami's 1Q84 has very little (if anything at all) to do with 1984. In a handful of places throughout 1Q84, Murakami makes direct reference to Orwell's 1984, with one of his characters remarking that their present situation really is just like that book by George Orwell, but that really is it. What particularly annoyed me was that Murakami did not appear to have fully understood, or possibly even read 1984. The 1984 references were blunt, cliched statements about Big Brother or doublespeak, which didn't actually apply to the situations at hand anyway. Given the fact that I didn't even really enjoy reading Orwell's 1984 to begin with, I was understandably miffed. For now, let me be absolutely clear that I would happily recommend Murakami's 1Q84. It just doesn't quite live up to the hype. But then, that's the problem with hype, isn't it?"
276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16404316-jenny-baker,Rating 4 out of 5,"I chose 1Q84 as my introduction to Murakami, because I already owned it on Audible and a used paperback edition. Now I understand why everyone loves his work. He's a fantastic writer and his storytelling feels cinematic. I can't wait to read his other novels. "

278,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3907888-anthony,Rating 2 out of 5,"What a huge disappointment! There are two kinds of long books. Ones which you wish would never end, and ones that feel like they are never going to end. This is the latter. I had high hopes for this book, I was hoping it was to be Murakami's magnum opus. It was so mediocre it actually makes me doubt what I saw as genius in some of his other novels: like Wind Up Bird Chronicle, and Hard boiled wonderland. I have long been a huge fan of Murakami's blending of the mundane ( detailed paragraphs describing the protagonist boiling spaghetti, vacuuming, ironing shirts etc. ) with the supernatural (talking cats, spirits from another dimension etc.) Somehow he often blends the two perfectly, with amazing results. But in his latest the descriptions of household chores just feel like, well, chores. And the supernatural weird stuff just feels tossed in. It's hard to say why. In some of his books the supernatural element feels believable, powerful and scary. Here those same elements feel meaningless, and not very fleshed out. Perhaps the magic/mundane recipe has gotten stale. It doesn't help that at the heart of this 900 pg. book is a way-over the top unrequited love story that is unbearably schmalzy, and even worse, just ridiculously unbelievable. The main characters , who supposedly have been in the depths of true love, ever since they held hands when they were ten years old, are still deeply in love with eachother 20 years later, having never seen eachother since then. It's too much of a stretch to bear the weight of the entire plot. This might have been a better book if it clocked in at a sparse 500 pages. And this would be easy if he had just eschewed all of the repetitions. For some inexplicable reason Murakami narrates the same events over and over. Imagine: he describes a character buying a hat. Then the next chapter he describes the character remembering buying the hat. And then for good measure he throws in a description of the same scene from the hat-seller's viewpoint. It's so inept that reading this long winded book gave me a twitch in my right lower eyelid!"

For a bit I wasn't so sure I was going to make it, but I kept putting in my hour a day, hoping for the best, and finally I'm here at the end. Whoot! Let me begin the review this way: I really enjoy Haruki Murakami's writing style. I have several of his books in my permanent collection, here in my humble abode. He is an important author to read, and I thank my World Literature professor for making us read Norwegian Wood in that class, as to this day, it is still one of my favorites. With that said, IQ84 to me read like a snake eating its tail while flinging itself around on the tilt-a-whirl. It made me a bit dizzy and nausious in certain parts. With that said, I really liked the beginning and the end the best, as Murakami masterfully sets up and ends the story brilliantly, tying up loose ends and making the story feel as complete as possible. So, my only real complaint is with the middle. That part could of been edited down much more than it was, as this was the part that took me the longest time to read, and made me the dizziest, since the story just kept looping back upon itself. I didn't need 400 pages of that thank you very much, as I got the point in about 200 pages, and the rest I just kind of skimmed through, until I got closer to the end, in which things I was more interested in started to come through to unexpected conclusions.  All in all, not my favorite Murakami, but I am really proud with myself that I gave it a fair chance and stuck with it to the very end. I only hope the next big book I pick up will be better."

It's a simple love story about a woman and a man, yet every aspect of it is intricately woven into dreams that sometimes end as reality, sometimes lead somewhere and sometimes expire as soon as the sun goes up, all set amongst meticulous descriptions of Tokyo and its suburbs, taking place between April and December of 1984, holding a whole another novel inside it and touching upon a multitude of characters in an endearing way, not necessarily closing the plot loops, but leaving a genuine feeling that you knew those people, saw them on the street, and perhaps at some time in the future will see them agin. Perhaps not. Add to this magnificent music, complete recipes to simple yet tasteful cooking, fascinating imagery of death, birth and love, sprinkle it with a bit of fantasy and a bit of nonsense, and voila, you've got 1Q84.

283,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4643325-paul,Rating 4 out of 5,"Certainly an epic and immense novel. The story itself is way too detailed to outline here and do it any sort of justice. Suffice to to say there is a parallel reality involved based on the wordplay in Japanese; 9 and q being homophones. It is in the third person which makes it a little more difficult to relate to. The first two volumes are excellent and the tension and the narrative builds well. I found the third volume somewhat superfluous and a little convoluted. I felt like telling the author to get on with it and stop putting up obstacles for the plot to jump over.I wasn't expecting quite so sentimental an ending; that satisfied the romantic part of me, but I also felt somewhat disappointed and maybe would have preferred the book to end after volume 2. However that is a quibble. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading it and have been entertained. That in itself is a good recommendation, but I don't think it is a classic. I found Christopher Taylor's review in the London Review of Books very good and agreed with some of his premises. The brief passage about Jung at the end of the book, is, I think pivotal and laden with meaning and quite a number of threads fell into place. But this can be read at a number of levels, some simple and some complex. However you read it, it's still a good book."

I knew I had seen it on Goodreads in a few places, and I was in the mood to read a longer book, so when I saw it in the library, I checked it out. The first month I had it, I barely got through 100 pages. The second month of reading it, I got through more, but I couldn't make myself read anymore, so I decided to DNF. This book was dense. What could have been done in 150 pages was done in 400. There were chapters that were 10 pages too long because of all the excessive description. This book is three novels into one, but I just considered it one while reading it. The first part could have not been a book on its own. It was just set up and too much description about breasts and pubic hair. (There was  big  men writing women vibes in this). The plot was interesting, and I did really want to learn more about it. Aomame's plotline was interesting, and I did want to learn more about it, but it was just moving way too slow for my taste. Tengo was boring and made me uncomfortable with the way he constantly talked about being with a married woman and getting together with his students. Overall, disappointing. Maybe I'll reread this in the future. But for now, it's going to sit on my 'did not finish' list."

With all my fascination, I still didn't buy the book, the synopsis in the back wasn't encouraging or told me what it was really about.I stuffed the book in the back on my mind for later and years went by.

287,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2526638-claudia-turner,Rating 4 out of 5,"Let me begin by saying I love Murakami’s style. I think I’ve said this before on other work but he could talk about an ant for 800 pages and I’d be hooked. However, this book was not what I expected. For the length and the premise, I thought it would stir me more than it did. I left it about as moved as I’d be by ...a story of an ant. That sucks considering that if you told me the general plot I’d be extremely intrigued. I did like the feel- always do with Murakami- but it felt, for him, to lack the substance and vigor of say “The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle” or “Kafka on the Shore”. Perhaps it was the length and lack of editing. Some of the subplots could have been chiseled down or thrown out entirely and the repetition, like when harassers kept repeating what other characters said, oh man, it was mind-numbing. Given all the references to Proust you may have expected it to carry the thoughtfulness and depth of “In Search if Lost Time” but I was left feeling robbed, of potential and of time. Regardless, this is a writer after my own heart just in the very simplistic spiritual ease of his mind and maybe Japanese literature just translates well between worlds, but 4 stars."
288,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68029956-paul-h,Rating 4 out of 5,"Murakami is just the strangest author. I have somehow inexplicably read 20+ of his books without really LOVING any of them, though 1Q84 is the one almost-sort-of-exception to this rule; it's imperfect, but I think it's his best single work, albeit arguably not the place to start if you're new to Murakami. It has the most so-called 'serious' or 'literary' themes of any of his work (except for maybe Kafka on the Shore), particularly the stuff on 1984/1Q84, utopias/cults, and all that, which I think was done really well. The novel also has the usual frustrating Murakami cliches -- languid, boring descriptions of cooking + classical music, a fictional narrator who is clearly just Murakami, excessively detailed descriptions of female breasts, etc. -- but his signature dream-world fata morgana thing is just insanely effective in 1Q84. The Ushikawa POV stuff near the end could have just been cut altogether (saving about 200 pages), but that's the only serious flaw that I can think of."

 That emotionless gaze of hers was unwavering as it stared straight at Ushikawa, like starlight shining on a nameless, massive rock.The hardcover version 1Q84 gave me a crick in my shoulder from awkwardly balancing the book on my chest while reading in bed. It’s the kind of detail I think Haruki Murakami would appreciate, especially since I finished all 928 pages. In fact, I read a number of individual paragraphs and sentences several times, for the freshness of both the imagery and the insights. Reviewers of the novel, which was published in the U.S. in 2011, seemed to focus on its dystopian, Orwellian aspects, since the story is set in 1984. But Murakami’s 1984 becomes the mythical year 1Q84, a year that is both intrinsically a part of and divorced from the 1984 being lived by the rest of the world. Bent and twisted by its own realities, 1Q84 is less a science-fictional dystopia than a fairy tale world in which two innocents battle the irrational in order to win their own happiness. (Carl Jung is explicitly referenced by one of the characters.) The abuse and even murder of women is a driving force in the novel and touches the lives of most of the characters in one way or another, particularly the heroine Aomame, who is a combinaiton of avenging angel and hitwoman.Murakami is an internationalist, effortlessly combining tropes from both European and Japanese culture and mythology. Western food and classical music are simply part of a landscape that includes the tale of a magical town run by cats and fears of being lost in the dark forest. Both helpful and harmful figures are drawn in archetypal terms: the three witches or wise women; the evil dwarf; the Wise Queen and her faithful knight (these are my interpretations of various characters, so don’t look for any people actually called that). Having set the book in 1984 allowed Murakami to operate using a simpler technological frame of reference, enabling him to focus on the love story of two lonely and ultimately modern people who find each other in the threatening world of 1Q84.One of Murakami’s influences here – among others listed in the book’s graphic preliminary pages – is Proust’s A Remembrance of Things Past. Reading the novel takes a kind of extreme patience. Murakami’s prose is meticulously detailed and comprised of moment-by-moment observations. He never lets a meal go by without describing it. You could get a month’s worth of menus from reading this book, and you’d be eating really healthy. But Murakami has a beautiful mind. For that reason, one does not get too impatient with what sometimes feels like a lack of momentum, even at moments when the plot, in another writer’s hands, would be streaming along. And somehow, it’s a comfort that one always knows exactly what everyone is wearing, how their features are arranged, whether the lights are harsh or low, and exactly what sounds are coming from the street. Like reading Proust, this is a practice, not an entertainment. What Aomame, one of the point-of-view characters, explains about reading A Remembrance of Things Past applies equally well to reading Murakami: “It’s so detailed and beautifully written . . . But I can’t seem to go forward. It’s like I’m in a boat, paddling upstream. I row for a while, but then when I take a rest and am thinking of something, I find myself back where I started. Maybe that way of reading suits me now, rather than the kind of reading where you forge ahead to find out what happens. I don’t know how to put it exactly, but there is a sense of time wavering irregularly when you try to forge ahead. If what is in front is behind, and what is behind is in front, it doesn’t really matter, does it. Either way is fine.”The slow pace of the story telling grounds the fantastic elements of the novel, which revolve around the familiar but still fresh technique of the novel within the novel. This novel is called The Air Chrysalis, some fairy-like creatures are involved, and an additional celestial body is added to the earth’s skyscape. But to say more would be to give too much away. The novel within 1Q84 goes down a fairly typical road to publication, though its young authoress is distinctly odd, and somehow, the book’s being brought out into the world, initiates 1Q84 for Tengo, the ghost writer who is hired to turn The Air Chrysalis into something publishable.Aomame, whose story opens the book, somehow manages to climb into 1Q84 all on her own. She is a true heroine, making her living as a trainer at a gym but secretly working as an avenging angel for a wealthy widow bent on righting some of the evils in the (real) world. While the eventual meeting of Tengo and Aomame is the promise of this novel, its trajectory is so unhurried, even while it takes readers through realms of ugliness, violence, loneliness, and power, that ultimately, the novel’s real message seems to be its meditation on the nature of time, or possibly to simply to satisfy the reader with a story that brings its own kind of peace. Despite a plot that has far more elements of dramatic tension than his earlier The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, Haruki Murakami takes his time in an utterly painstaking manner in finally bringing this strange fantasy to a gratifying – and for that reason, unexpected – conclusion.

300,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26431802-eddie,Rating 2 out of 5,"This review contains spoilers so don’t read if you are lucky enough not to have read this book.I should preface this by saying Murakami was for some time my favourite author. I’ve long since come to terms with the fact that there are aspects of his novels that I’m not a fan of - mainly his portrayals of women and sex which definitely continues to be an issue here. However, I do think that he is a genius who has created multiple masterpieces in Kafka and the Shore, Dance Dance Dance and, most notably, The Wind-up Bird Chronicle. So, I was obviously coming into this book with this awareness of both the pitfalls and the ceilings of his novels.Now, this will come as no surprise to you if you’ve looked at the star rating already, but for me, this is the worst novel that Murakami has written since he established himself fully as a writer in A Wild Sheep’s Chase. The main issue of this novel for me (and believe me, there are a bunch), is how boring it is. Boring!? A Murakami novel!? Not a word I thought I’d be using to describe any of his books.This novel could lose five, six, seven hundred pages and still have room to cut. The amount of repetition, including but not exclusive to the multiple perspectives on events by the characters, was infuriating as a reader. It would be fine if these perspectives offered anything new on events, but honestly, most of the time it just felt like Murakami thought readers would forget everything they had read between every time they picked up the book. This is especially true of the Third Book in my opinion, which suffered from the addition of Ushikawa’s perspective (though, what is this, A Wind-up Bird crossover episode!?!).Which, fair play, I can absolutely see why this book would be an absolute slog to get through if you’re not a regular reader. My reaction when Tengo and Aomame finally met was not one of happiness or any emotion besides relief. The relationship between two characters who shared a moment of true connection when they were young is a nice idea in concept, but left me feeling cold in practice, and made the heart of the narrative feel empty to me. He has an almost careless disregard for characters – Fuka-Eri who felt like a main character just kind of peaced out I guess. Along with this repetition, I was so deeply bored of the central questions surrounding Maza and Dohta. There are many questions the reader is left with at the end of the novel. What happened to Tengo’s older lover? What’s going on with the bath-robe connection between Aomame’s cop friend’s death and Tengo’s mother’s death? Will any of the main characters finally pay up for their fragrant failure to pay their NHK license fee? These are all good questions that Murakami has no interest in answering. Which, fine, if you go into a Murakami novel expecting everything to be resolved you’re setting yourself up to be disappointed. But for a 1300 page magnum opus that is meant to be the great defence of the long novel, it would have been nice to feel any justification at all for its length or any kind of answers to the dozens of questions Murakami throws up. I think unanswered questions work much better in his shorter work, but maybe people disagree with this. I would direct anyone looking to read Murakami to literally any of his novels over this. I’m glad I read it to complete the set, but I would not recommend it – and I would definitely not advise you to listen to the 46-hour audiobook as one of my friends did. Some of the lines in this book should never be read aloud hahahahaha"
301,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista,Rating 5 out of 5,"A true story:When I was in high school, during an evening of sharing freaky but true stories with my friends, Nancy said that she was going to tell us something she had never told anyone before. Apparently, when she was a young girl, she would periodically be visited by Little People in the middle of the night. She would know they were coming when she woke up in her bed feeling paralyzed. Her eyes were the only part of her that she could move and she would scan the baseboards, knowing that that's where they would appear. First a few splinters would fall away, and then a hole would be visible, through which numerous small, gnome-like figures would materialise. Without fail, one would jump up on her bed, climb onto her chest and begin talking to her, chattering away and, according to Nancy, making sure that she couldn't tell what the rest of them were up to. No matter how she tried, Nancy couldn't move or speak, and although the gnome on her chest seemed cheerful and friendly, she was terrified. After a time, the interlopers would finish their business, depart through the baseboard and replace the splinters so perfectly that Nancy could never find their entrance by the light of day. Neither could she ever remember what the gnome on her chest had been chatting about. This was not the strangest part of her story.As I said, these visits only happened when Nancy was a young girl, and they had not occurred for some years at the telling of this story. However, just a couple of weeks before, her older brother had come to her with a strange story of his own. Apparently, Ron had spent the evening before at the drive-in with his friends, and as was his habit back then, he had been drinking heavily all evening-- enough so that he had fallen asleep and the friends he came with had left with other friends. Ron woke up just as the second movie was ending, and as he found himself alone in his truck, decided he might as well leave right then. When he went to reach for the key in the ignition, he discovered that his arm was paralyzed, soon realising that the only parts of his body he could move were his eyes. As he scanned the interior of the truck, movement caught his attention, and there, on the dash in front of him, was a small, gnome-like creature. It smiled and laughed and starting telling him that he'd be a fool to drive home in his condition. Struck with fear, he tried to agree, grunting and blinking, and the gnome disappeared. Ron was suddenly able to move again, and, seeing someone he knew in the car next to him, he was able to get a safe ride home.Obviously, the rest of us were covered in goose bumps as Nancy told this story. She assured us that she had never once told her brother about the visits she had received from the Little People, and although the rest of us found the whole story to be more than a little terrifying, Nancy had a different view: she now believed that the gnome that had visited her brother had likely saved his life, and looking back, she couldn't ascribe any malevolent purpose to her night-time visitors; that it was all a matter of interpretation, of perspective.This is still not the strangest part of the story, to me.Within about six months, the movie Cat's Eye came out, and I saw it in the theater with the same group of friends. The movie is made up of three short stories by Stephen King, and in the third story, a story written specifically for the movie and not previously released in any collection, a small gnome-like ogre creature enters the room of a sleeping girl, through the baseboards. First, the wood splinters and then a hole is visible. This nasty creature enters the room, climbs onto the bed, perches on the sleeping girl's chest, and attempts to suck the breath out of her. She is only saved by the stray cat that she has been trying to convince her mother to let her keep.I can't describe the feeling of worlds colliding that this caused; the overlapping of fantasy and reality and not quite being able to distinguish between fiction and nonfiction. My skin crawled, my heart raced, my vision narrowed. And after the movie, Nancy didn't want to talk about it. If I reacted so strongly, I can't even imagine how she felt. Oh yeah, I just checked and Cat's Eye came out in 1985. That means that Nancy likely told us this story in 1984, or 1Q84, and that brings me to the book.I started reading this without really knowing what it was going to be about, but having read The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, I knew it would be a bit of a mindbender. Nothing, however, could have prepared me for the first time Tengo mentioned the Little People. My skin crawled, my heart raced, my vision narrowed. Even before anything had been described about their appearance or actions, I thought of Nancy and her night-time visitors, and whether they climb out of a dead goat's mouth or bust through the baseboards, I believe they're all the same thing. I know I have said before that I don't have much time for Magical Realism as a genre, but that doesn't mean that I don't believe that a type of magic might be real; that there are events going on beneath the surface of our everyday lives that can't be explained by science or math or logic. There's so much Jungian imagery in this book, and even though I know next to nothing about what Jung taught, I'm left believing that the Little People must be from our collective unconscious, that they represent some archetype as I understand them . 
""Ho ho,"" called the keeper of the beat.""Ho ho,"" the other six joined in.
Those words filled me with an ambiguous sense of dread; like the characters in 1Q84 , I have no way of knowing if the Little People are good or evil or something else; something predating man and God and time. I know this book has some seriously mixed reviews, averaging out to being regarded as a steaming pile of staggering genius, but I wonder if the readers' experiences are mostly informed by their consciousness of the archetypes. As Tengo's father says, ""If you can't understand it without an explanation, you can't understand it with an explanation."" Without an explanation, I believe I understood this book viscerally; it started with the Little People, but everything from the town of cats to a sky with two moons seemed reasonable and somehow both ancient and timeless.For those who don't connect to the details of the story, Murakami sprinkles several metafictional comments throughout the book, acting as a pre-emptive counterargument to his critics, such as:
One reviewer concluded his piece, ""As a story, the work is put together in an exceptionally interesting way and it carries the reader along to the very end, but when it comes to the question of what is an air chrysalis, or who are the Little People, we are left in a pool of mysterious question marks. This may well be the author's intention, but the readers are likely to take this lack of clarification as a sign of 'authorial laziness'…""Tengo cocked his head in puzzlement. If an author succeeded in writing a story ""put together in an exceptionally interesting way"" that ""carries the reader along to the very end"", who could possibly call such a writer ""lazy""?
To get back to Jung and archetypes and synchronicity, when I finished this novel I sat quietly turning it over in my mind for several minutes, and then stretched and got off the couch, overdue for going to bed. I glanced at the clock and it read 11:11…But that would be a true story for another time."
302,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5586751-lilith,Rating 4 out of 5,"Por si hay alguien que no lo sabe, 1Q84 es una trilogía (aunque realmente la denominación de trilogía viene de que la historia está divida en tres partes bien diferenciadas), que se publicó en nuestro país hace ya un par de años. Como bien dice la sinopsis de la novela, en japonés, la letra q y el número 9 son homófonos, los dos se pronuncian kyu, de manera que 1Q84 es, sin serlo, 1984, una fecha de ecos orwellianos, siendo quizás uno de sus principales atractivos (por lo tanto, si queréis leer la novela, os recomiendo haber leído la obra de Orwell antes). Y es que la acción de 1Q84 efectivamente transcurre en el año 1984, pero no precisamente ese 1984 que Orwell imaginó. Aquí vive gente a primera vista normal, una mujer cercana a la treintena de nombre Aomame, que se dedica a enseñar defensa personal en un centro deportivo y acude a las casas de sus clientes para hacer ejercicios musculares cuando es necesario, y por otro lado está Tengo, también cercano a esa edad, un hombre fuerte, un genio de las matemáticas desde pequeño y escritor asiduo, pero que, por ahora, no ha conseguido publicar ninguna de sus obras. Dos vidas a priori como las de miles de personas en ese 1984. Sin embargo, no todo es tan simple.Aquí Haruki Murakami divide la acción en dos focos (y más adelante en tres), por un lado podemos leer la historia de Aomame y por otro la historia de Tengo. Así pues, sus historias se irán intercalando, profundizándose, explayándose y contrayéndose hasta llegar a unos elementos comunes, a un punto común. Aomame es la que abre esta trilogía, en los primeros compaces nos la encontramos dentro de un taxi, esperando. Llega tarde a una cita muy importante, va vestida con su único traje y tacones. Aquí las cosas suceden sin que nos demos cuenta, los detalles a los que menos damos importancia en nuestra vida cotidiana son los que importan. Casi toda acción conlleva una respuesta, aunque sea lejana. Aomame decide bajarse en mitad de la autopista por la recomendación del taxista, solo tiene que caminar un tramo de la autopista y bajar unas escaleras de emergencia. De repente empieza a acordarse de una amiga que perdió hace tiempo. Tras una serie de arreglos, consigue llegar a su destino. Tiene que hablar con un hombre, un hombre que ha hecho algo realmente malo, tiene que ponerle fin. En otras palabras, tiene que matarlo. ¿Os acordáis? No todo es tan simple.Y es que Aomame a parte de ser una instructora de un gimnasio tiene un trabajo puntual muy curioso, mata hombres. Hombres que han cometido crímenes atroces según su punto de vista y el de la persona que le manda hacer esos trabajos. Esos hombres tienen que ser eliminados, bajo cualquier precio. Su historia transcurre al principio de forma sencilla, la seguimos durante su día a día. Ella nos cuenta sobre su amiga muerta, a veces, sobre su pasado. Un pasado que aunque le cueste, acepta que forma parte de ella, y que no hay nada que hacer. Sin embargo, aunque su historia sea la más ""tranquila"", ella es la indiscutible protagonista de 1Q84.La historia de Tengo es más completa. Hay más movimiento. Hay más personajes involucrados (o quizás simplemente sea mi simple opinión). Conocemos a Tengo cuando tiene uno de sus ataques. Aunque no es un ataque exactamente, es un recuerdo que le asalta, una y otra vez, con una nitidez casi absoluta y que le lleva atormentando desde hace años. Le acompaña en ese momento su ""editor"" Komatsu, que trabaja para una editorial y forma parte del jurado del premio a los jóvenes talentos -realmente no me acuerdo del término en español, puesto que lo leí en inglés-. Los dos hablan de una obra, una obra que ha destacado por encima de todas las demás. La crisálida del aire. Escrita por una joven de diecisiete años de edad, muy peculiar, inigualable, rara. Le cuesta hablar, solo dice palabras concretas, con el mismo tono, siempre. No parece que sepa expresar sus sentimientos, su cara no los refleja al menos, solo sus ojos, lo absorben todo, lo estudian todo. A veces parece que pueda desnudarte el alma.Sin quererlo o sin esperarlo, Tengo se verá envuelto en una historia bastante compleja. Una historia que comenzará justo aquí, con una petición de Komatsu, con su primer encuentro con Fukaeri, y que tendrá mucho que ver con La crisálida del aire (libro que obsesionará a muchos de los personajes de la novela). Y es que Tengo tendrá que reescribir la novela que ha escrito Fukaeri, darle forma, sacar lo mejor posible de ella para que pueda llevarse el premio en el que Komatsu es parte del jurado, repartiéndose después la pasta. Cada uno de los personajes envueltos en esta peligrosa acción tendrán sus propios motivos (muchas veces ocultos, otros tantas evidentes, pero que tomarán un camino inesperado). Aomame por su cuenta y Tengo por la suya, dos personajes que habitan en el mismo mundo, un mundo que ha dejado de ser el que ellos conocían en algún momento. Un mundo en el que cuando se pone el sol, salen dos lunas. Aomame es la primera en darse cuenta que hay cosas que no cuadran, cosas que se le escapan, que hay cosas de las que no se acuerda. Es también la primera en ser atacada por la otra parte. Como si de un combate se tratase, los malos intentarán ponerle fin al mecanismo que se ha puesto en marcha, mientras que nuestros protagonistas intentarán sobrevivir. Salir con vida. O no renunciar al menos, no aún.Gente que se escapa de su antigua vida y decide empezar de cero. Gente que se le une y decide seguirles, convirtiéndose así en una comunidad. Una comunidad que crece y que empieza a funcionar por su cuenta, un futuro que no sale como uno se lo imaginaba en el primer momento. Y una historia un poco sobrenatural detrás. Estos son los momentos claves de la otra parte de 1Q84, la parte a la que se tienen que enfrentar Aomame y Tengo, la parte que tiene más componentes de realismo mágico tan característico en Murakami. La little people, el Líder, los ""antagonistas"" de la historia tienen sus propios motivos para hacer lo que hacen también. Pese a que la historia se divida en tres partes, -hay momentos que resultan un poco más atractivos que otros- en general, 1Q84 mantiene un ritmo regular, constante. Aunque parece que no haya pasado gran cosa en un capítulo, realmente hemos dado otro paso más hacia delante. Otro de los mayores atractivos de este libro (o libros) dejando atrás la estructura, su complejidad, el estilo del autor o la caracterización (magistral) de todos sus personajes (tanto principales como no) es la escondida historia de amor. Enterrada en lo más profundo de sus páginas, puesto que en un principio tan solo sabemos que para Aomame existió alguien hace mucho tiempo, y Tengo tiene su propia historia con una mujer que está casada. Y es que una de las partes más maravillosas de la trilogía es ver cómo Murakami logra transmitirte a ti los sentimientos de sus protagonistas pero sin plasmarlo en palabras que salgan a través de sus labios, tan solo lo sabes, lo notas, y te parece lo más normal del mundo.Aquí se habla de una historia de amor que es capaz de cambiar el mundo que nos rodea, que nos impulsa a seguir delante, que nos mantiene vivos, esperando el momento perfecto para dar el paso o esperar a que las casualidades existan. Murakami ha escrito quizás una de las historias de amor más bonitas que he leído. Y eso ya es motivo suficiente para leerlo de nuevo. Comunidades religiosas, personajes perdidos, retorcidos, motivos ocultos, y un montón de recuerdos, algunos más bonitos que otros, son tan solo algunos de sus otros atractivos. Por lo tanto, si no lo habéis leído, es un buen momento para hacerlo."
303,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28557510-demet,Rating 1 out of 5,"Kitabı bitirdiğimde aklımdaki yıldız sayısı iki idi, ancak üzerinden zaman geçip de biraz daha kitap ile ilgili düşündüğümde yıldız sayısı 1'e düştü. Bunun birincil sebebi 2018'in son kitabı olarak bitirdiğimi düşünürsek, herkes gibi yıl sonunda altın vuruş yapayım zirvede bırakayım derken, boşa atıp dolu tutamamış olmam üzerine de beklentimi hiç karşılayamamış bir kitap olması. Diğer bir sebebi de bu 1200 küsur sayfa yerine başka bir 1200 sayfa okumuş olsaydım neler okuyacaktım acaba düşüncesini bir türlü kafamdan atamamış olmam. Hacimce kallavi kitap okumuş olmaktan asla gözü korkmayan bir okur olarak, derdim hacmiyle de değil. Büyülü gerçeklik kitabı olarak sınıflandırılan 1Q84, bu büyülü gerçeklik atmosferini bir türlü yaratamamış, okuyucu olarak o evrene bir türlü dahil olunamıyor. O evrene dair 1200 sayfa boyunca bir çok ipucu verse de, o evrendeki 'puzzle'ın parçaları bir türlü birleşmiyor, anlatılmak istenen gerçek dünya/öteki dünya ikilemi tam olarak bir ikilemmiş gibi gelemiyor. Kitabın en sevimsiz yeri ya da en sevmediğim yanı nedir diye düşünüyorum, ama aralarından bir şey seçmek gerçekten çok zor. Yine de en sevmediğim yanı ödülünü ""karakterlerin muhteşemliği""ne vermek istiyorum. Bu kadar pürüzsüz, bu kadar düzgün ana karakterler çizmek gerçekten inanılmaz. Yalnız/dışlanmış ama ayakta kalmayı başarabilecek kadar güçlü, çok güzel sportif -ama memeleri küçük bu önemli bir konu bak- bir kadın, çok yakışıklı-güçlü-kadınların ilgisini oldukça çeken bir erkek, çok başarılı, çok yönlü karakterlerin muhteşemliği okuru gerçekten çok yoruyor. Hadi ikinci sevimsizlik ödülünü de açıklayayım: REKLAMLAR: Gucci marka çanta, junko şimada döpiyes, toyota marka arabalar, carlsberg-heinekken biralar, bilmemne marka ayakkabı, rayban gözlük. Bu nesneler markalarından bağımsız olarak nitelendirilemiyor hiç, bu nesneleri nerede görürsek görelim mutlaka markası ile anıyoruz, inanılmaz gerçekten.George Orwell'ın 1984 adlı romanından esinlenilmiş kitabın ismi malum, kör gözüme bir gönderme zaten görmemek elde değil. Ama yazarın kitaba kattığı siyasi atmosfer veya taraflılık sevimli troçkistimiz Orwell ile sınırlı değil tabi, ucundan ama ciddi ciddi ucundan değinilen 1960 Japonya-Amerikan Güvenlik Antlaşmasının ardından yaşanan öğrenci olaylarımız var, buradan komünlere uzanan bir yolculuk var, birazcık da Japon Kızıl Tugaylarından bahsediliyor. Ama komünist bir komünden, neredeyse dini bir cemaate geçiş var ki evlere şenlik cidden. Tüm bunlar o kadar ucundan çeşni olarak kitabın olay örgüsüne katılmış ki, fazlasıyla sırıtıyor. Unutmadan bir noktayı daha mutlaka eklemem gerekir, eksik kalırsa aklımda kalır alimallah. Nasıl olsa 1250 sayfa kitap, okur aklında tutmaz bu kadarını diye düşünüp yapılan kurgu hataları epey göze bakıyor. Kadın karakterimizin en iyi kadın arkadaşıyla tek sevişme sahnesini tabii ki bir kaç defa anlatan Murakami, olayın heyecanına kapılmış olsa gerek; bir kere gerçekleştiğini vurguladığı sevişme sahnesini kitabın başında başka anlatıyor, ileriki sayfalarda bir anda olayın yeri ve zamanı değişiveriyor. Bir çok ayrıntıyı bir çok defa tekrar tekrar okurken, bunu da iki farklı şekilde okuyuversin okur denilmiş sanırsam.Her neyse, üzerinde düşündükçe daha pek çok sevimsiz ayrıntıyı hatırlıyorum. Kitapla ilgili son söz olarak; Murakami kendince popüler-bestseller yaratma konusunda gerçekten çok usta bir kalem denilebilir. Rahat okunan, bol bol popüler ögeleri kitabın içinde kullanan bir kitap yaratılmış. Michael Jackson, caz ve klasik müzik, Steve Mcqueen filmleri, Franz Kafka, tabii ki Dostoyevski, Shakespeare'siz asla, Proust, Jung daha kimler kimler arzı endam ediyor kitapta; 'name dropping'in şahını görüyoruz, ya da başka bir ifadeyle metinlerarasılık bu değil, bunları okuyucu bulacaktı keşfedecekti sanki. Sağolsun Murakami, okuyucuyu hiç yormuyor rahat rahat oku diyor; ne o öyle Prousttan üstü kapalı bahsedeceğim de sen onu anlamaya çalışacaksın, ben Machbect göndermesi yapıcam da sen üstüne düşüneceksin, ben sen yorulmayasın diye hemen bahsediyorum ondan diyor. Kişisel 2018'imi bitirirken en son kitap seçimi kararımla, 2018'deki kararlarımı da düşündürttü bana; en azından böyle bir katkısı olduğu için hakkını yemeyeceğim, tek yıldızım da bunun şerefine olsun. 2018'deki tüm kararlarım bu kadar kötü değildir umarım diyerek ben düşünmeye geçeyim en iyisi!"

309,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david,Rating 3 out of 5,"I am starting to think that Haruki Murakami is the Robert Heinlein of Japanese literature. Or maybe the Martin Amis of Japanese literature.Murakami, best-selling Japanese author beloved of American literary hipsters, writes weird magical, surrealistic novels with fantastic flourishes and a tinge of sci-fi, usually some sort of parallel/alternate world storyline, and gets hailed as a Literary Big Name, but honestly, having read several of his books now, it is pretty clear that he always writes the same guy - a kind of dweeby Everyman who passively waits around for things to happen and then passively watches them happen, occasionally participating minimally as things happen to him, but mostly waiting for the climax where he gets to fuck the hot Manic Pixie Action Girl. Of course he will fuck most of the other female characters who appear in the book as well, but the Manic Pixie Action Girl is special.This isn't new ground, either in literature or in literary criticism. Feminists have been writing about the propensity of authors like Philip Roth and Martin Amis and Salman Rushdie to write books which are basically big literary masturbation exercises describing nubile young hotties jumping on older men who happen to resemble the author, but if anyone epitomized this in genre fiction, it was Robert Heinlein. (Well, him and Piers Anthony, but comparing Murakami to Piers Anthony would be really unfair.)IQ84 has two protagonists: Tengo, a young unpublished writer who fits our description of passive protagonist who gets to screw all the hotties, and Aomame, the main hottie who works as an assassin killing abusive men for an elderly rich lady who runs a women's shelter. On one of her assignments, Aomame takes a detour down some emergency exit stairs to get off a freeway, and finds herself in a parallel world - one she calls 1Q84 (the novel is set in the year 1984) because it is a ""question."" In 1Q84, most of history is the same as she remembers, except for subtle changes, like Japanese policemen carrying guns following a terrorist attack by a religious organization she doesn't remember. And the fact that there are now two moons, but apparently she is one of the few people who have noticed this.Tengo's half of the story goes in an even more bizarre surrealistic direction, as he becomes a ghost writer for an autistic teenage girl (she is never actually described as autistic, but her behavior pretty clearly mirrors autism) who wrote a rough draft of an incredibly imaginative but poorly written story about ""little people"" who have the power to change the world. Tengo eventually finds out the little people are real, that Aomame is his childhood sweetheart, that he's in a parallel universe with two moons, and of course he gets to screw the pretty autistic teenage girl, in a weird sex scene that Murakami seems to want to have both ways - it's erotic with ample descriptions of the girl's lovely breasts combined with hairless prepubescent genitalia, yet the way in which it happens seems intended to absolve Tengo of agency or responsibility for, you know, screwing an autistic underage girl.I gotta say, Murakami can be pretty damn creepy, and not just about the magical surreal horror lurking in the background of so many of his stories. Both his male and female characters are constantly examining themselves and musing on the unique and fascinating properties of their genitalia, Aomame mentions the size, shape, and slight imperfections of her breasts and nipples about a dozen times, and when it comes to the sexing, it's aaaaaaaaaallll about the penis, man! Hands, mouths, pussies, Tengo gets to experience them all (always in that infuriating passive manner of Murakami protagonists), and no sex scene can be complete without a literally seminal climax. I mean, let's face it, the dude is just obsessed with penises and semen. I have not yet read a Murakami novel that didn't include detailed descriptions of both.As a novel, 1Q84 was interesting. The story took a while to get underway, and then it took a while to wend circuitously around to a point, but it finally gets there. For that, and for Murakami's imaginative ideas and writing, I give it 3 stars. But it's really more like a 2.5 star book, as it was repetitive (story is very reminiscent of Wind Up Bird Chronicle or Kafka on the Shore) and the characters even moreso, and it was such a bloated book, Murakami could have told the same story with half as many pages and half as many penis scenes. Definitely not his best work."

This book can not be a movie or else it will be a disaster movie."
311,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11233506-christopher,Rating 4 out of 5,"Having just finished reading 1Q84, listening to Leoš Janáček's Sinfonietta, I am reminded of Franz Kafka. He once wrote, ""Many complain that the words of the wise are always merely parables and of no use in daily life, which is the only life we have. When the sage says: “Go over,” he does not mean that we should cross over to some actual place, which we could do anyhow if the labor were worth it; he means some fabulous yonder, something unknown to us, something too that he cannot designate more precisely, and therefore cannot help us here in the very least. All these parables really set out to say merely that the incomprehensible is incomprehensible, and we know that already. But the cares we have to struggle with every day: that is a different matter. Concerning this a man once said: Why such reluctance? If you only followed the parables you yourselves would become parables and with that rid yourself of all your daily cares. Another said: I bet that is also a parable. The first said: You have won. The second said: But unfortunately only in parable. The first said: No, in reality: in parable you have lost."" Having just finished reading 1Q84, listening to Leoš Janáček's Sinfonietta, I am reminded of the many criticisms that I've heard aimed at this work. I admit there are some little things that I don't like in the diction and usage, but for most ""mistakes,"" I can find reasonable explanations. The few instances of awkward conjunction use, may be editing errors. The occasional bland, ambiguous diction may be an issue of translation. And so on. There's a huge chasm between the criticism of the language and the language of the criticism. Until I read this in the original Japanese, (which, I'll never do...probably) or read some literary criticism of a scholar that has, I want to put the more subtle language issues aside. Instead, I want to look at what the work does.  Having just finished reading, listening to Leoš Janáček's Sinfonietta, I am reminded of what I like about Haruki Murakami. He takes risks. He tells an elusive story in a direct manner. He writes philosophical literature that doesn't seem like philosophy. He creates his own world, of both abstract and concrete images, complete with its own soundtrack. He's pre-modern in that his 3rd person narrator never quite enters into the equation yet he's post-modern in his hyper-referentialism and fragmented perspectivalism. 1Q84 probes the reciprocity of storytelling and reality. Time ostensibly flows in an ordinary manner, but there are also other curled up dimensions that we don't have access to. Rather than the observer impacting the observation, the subject of the observation impacts the observer. As in many other allegorical stories the reader gathers fistfuls of threads only to create more difficult knots. But Murakami knows that his reader will feel this way. At one point, his ""narrator"" asks a series of questions about events in the novel that the reader has more knowledge of than the character and then thinks aloud on the character's behalf: ""No answers were forthcoming, of course, just an aimless bunch of questions. Too many questions, too few answers. It was always like this."" Is Murakami teasing us? Before you answer, consider that he brings a gun into the story, has a character paraphrase Chekhov's dictum, (""If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there."") loads and reloads it incessantly, only to never fire it. Later, on another character's behalf the ""narrator"" says, ""There were too many questions. It was probably Chekhov who said that the novelist is not someone who answers questions but someone who asks them."" A memorable line, yes, but did Chekhov really say that? The closest quote I'm aware of is actually, ""Anyone who says that the artist's field is all answers and no questions has never done any writing or had any dealings with imagery."" Did he count on you to look it up? Are we asking the right questions?  Suspending your judgment long enough to let this work seep into your subconscious may be something only a true Murakami fan will do. But that would be a shame. Also, look past the weird sex."
312,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3917029-stacia,Rating 5 out of 5,"A masterpiece by Murakami.I've been pondering my thoughts about this book. And, ultimately, the word I keep coming back to in relation to this book is... basket.The construction of the story is woven like a basket. Murakami starts with various separate pieces, then starts weaving them together. As the story circles around & around, the weaving gets tighter, pulling all the pieces closer together while rotating again & again. (I realize that some have gotten bogged down in the repetition of the story, but I found it fascinating to watch his construction, to watch him carefully take one tiny design, include it somewhere else later, and continue sprinkling it through so that the final product produces a beautiful, cohesive design.)The finished product is an epic, yet simple story, well-constructed. It is an impressive work created by a master craftsman. A universal story that, like baskets that have been used in most societies from ancient times to present day, can appeal across cultural divides, across time divides. Functional, useful, and beautiful at the same time. Universal themes such as love, ethics, religion, reality, and many more are woven into the story -- topics that would have been as appropriate a thousand years ago as they are today to people both far & wide. A design that is recognizable across cultures, yet has unique components that showcase Murakami's style & heritage too. And even though this story is like a modern-day basket, it pays homage to the ones before it, referencing some of the great works produced by artists, authors, and others from past times. A reflection of both old & new (& perhaps what is yet to come?).And this book made me sure to look at the moon, more than once. And how can I not love a book that reminds me to be awed by the beauty of the moon? Our universal, shared moon... common to every person on the planet.This is the third Murakami work I've read & I'd definitely rate it as the most mainstream of the ones I've read, yet it's not necessarily the one I'd recommend starting with if you've never read Murakami. Perhaps you can get a deeper appreciation for his skill if you're already a fan of his work. Otherwise, it might be to easy to dismiss 1Q84 as simple or basic, when in reality it may look simple, but is really a masterpiece created by a world-class artist.{Spoiler ahead...}Ironically, I was a bit surprised by the (happy) ending. Because, even though I saw the story being crafted through hundreds of pages, I was still unsure if Aomame & Tengo were heading toward happiness or not.... Did fate lead them there or was it their free-will? Once I saw where Aomame's & Tengo's stories ended in this book, I have to believe they will overcome any adversities they meet & enjoy a happy future together. They have already weathered the adverse, the strange, the mundane to get to the end, or beginning, of their story together. Time is a circle, watched over by the moon."
313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16181797-wayland-smith,Rating 1 out of 5,"Reading different books brings out different reactions in me, ranging from ""Wow, that was cool,"" to ""Eh, that was ok,"" and a few others. Occasionally, I read one and end up going, ""What the fuck was that supposed to be?"" This was one of those. 1Q84 is a really weird tale of parallel worlds, strange beings, a weird cult, supernaturally aware young girls, and magical sex. No, really. The majority of the book alternates POV's between two characters. Aomame is a martial arts instructor/ peronsal trainer at a high end gym. When she's not doing that, she assassinates men who have committed acts of domestic violence, with the backing of a strange and wealthy older woman. Tengo is a part time teacher at a ""cram school,"" which helps prepare students for their upcoming exams. He's also an aspiring novelist. These two met when they were 10, had a deeply important bonding moment they remembered for the rest of their lives, and then decided to not do anything about finding each other for the next two decades. Because that's what you do when someone is really important to you, right? A young girl with a mysterious past writes a novel that could be good, but has some flaws in the writing. An unscrupulous publisher called Komatsu recruits his friend/flunky Tengo to secretly rewrite it, and it becomes a smash hit. Unfortunately, it also reveals details that a reclusive and secretive cult would rather remain hidden. Things like their leader raping 10 year old girls. A few characters drift from the real world into the one of the novel, which they mostly can tell because there's a second moon in the sky. Along the way there are various deaths, an exploding dog, a cop who goes on random sexual hook ups, the ghost of a bill collector who's not actually dead, and two thugs for hire that we never get names for, just haircut descriptions. About two thirds of the way through the book, what has been a minor character suddenly gets his own POV chapters for no reason that I can determine. Other weird features include characters who can tell who is calling by the way a phone rings (long before ring tones), people intuiting volumes of information from a nod of the head, and a fairly important secondary character who gets referred to by name maybe twice, despite being in many, many scenes and referred to in even more. Aside from several scenes that really didn't seem to need to be there, what drove me up the wall about this book was endless, needless repitition. It was over 11oo pages, and I wonder how much of that could have been cut if they'd stopped doing things like Character A says x, and then Character B asks, So you're saying x? Things like this and a paragraph long prayer that gets repeated many, many times makes me wonder if we could have lost 10-25% of this by just cutting them. I've heard a lot of good things about this book, and I sadly just don't see why. Maybe it's just me."

But I could not put this book down. I felt compelled to turn the page and continue. I needed to know what was going to happen? Who were these people? What was the Air Chrysalis? Would Aomame and Tengo reunite? And as each book ended, I was strangely satisfied by what I had read and yet eager to begin the next chapter. A complex tale that weaves symbolism and mysticism and faith (more personal, less religious) into what essentially is an epic love story.Parallel worlds. Strange Little People. Dohta. Massa. Two Moons. Some readers may argue this is typical Murakami magical realism with a sci-fi twist. But I argue that it's not. I certainly am no Murakami expert. I've only read a couple of his other works and none of his other novels. But the books I have read, and what I've read about him, have always made me feel that his work is essentially Japanese--in its style and content. But 1Q84, one could easily replace Toyko with London or New York or Bombay. While the story took place in Japan, the characters and the plot could have happened anywhere, to anyone. And this is where I think Murakami has crossed the line from being a ""Japanese"" writer to the proclaimed ""world"" writer. And I think he's a stronger writer for it. To be able to tell a universally identifiable story that still retains elements of who he is as an author is a talent that he is honing to a fine precision.The only reason this is a 4 star and not a 5 star rating is that, for me, Book 2 felt at times bit too fixated. Perhaps I am getting prudish in my old age (although I don't think so), but I felt there was a redundancy in the amount of sexual descriptions in this second book. Overall, there was relevancy in what was described and the situations created. And I'm not saying it shouldn't have been in the book at all. Perhaps it was the translation (and not so much the translator's fault, but simply English itself couldn't capture what is readily understood in Japanese)? But it felt like too often certain descriptions and passages were being repeated word-for-word. And because of that, I found it distracting to the overall story. But this is such a minor complaint and doesn't take away from the book as whole in the least bit.For my first Murakami novel, it was a fantastic experience."
315,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3817450-marnie,Rating 1 out of 5,"I've made it more than halfway through this book and I'm done. I can't do it anymore. It's not just that the author is so bad at writing women and so obsessed with breasts that his female POV character has checked her breasts twice, so far, to establish her own continuity in a world that has changed. It's not just the male POV character keeps referring to his only girlfriend as his ""older girlfriend,"" and describes her as a jealous, ugly, controlling women with whom he suffers through some boring conversations about her life between bouts of regular sex because she literally asks nothing of him emotionally. The reason I'm giving up on this book is its framing of the women in this story as being driven by a desire to fight back against male sexual violence while also framing at least two men who are having sex with non-menstruating young girls as being powerless pawns forced to do so by powers out of their control. Perhaps there's some way this story makes that not problematic by the end but I'm a bit sick of the sexualization of a 17 year-old girl for her hairless genitals and giant newly-formed breasts, all while we're are being assured that the guy having sex with her couldn't have stopped it and it isn't like she's actually a pre-pubescent girl, she just has some of the characteristics of one and a lack of social skills that would allow her to have ever dated people her own age. There's also some insufferable nonsense about star-crossed lovers who knew each other very briefly in grade school and apparently they both masturbate to the memory of the other person in that prepubescent state. Oh and there's loads of really poorly written sex written by a man who clearly has no idea how to pleasure a woman. Even when a desperately horny POV character is fantasizing about a man on a train, her fantasy is literally just squeezing the man's junk. It doesn't actually happen, she just goes home and falls asleep and has a dream about having sex in which the only detail mentioned is that her breasts are bigger. This man honestly thinks women are just boob transportation devices who are obsessed with hard-ons. So I'm done with this. It's too bad. I love sci-fi and I think the premise could have been something really interesting and fun, but it feels like a punishment every time I try to get a little further along in the story. "

But no, 1Q84 had to be just intriguing enough to keep me dangling off its edge right until the end before it said 'Sorry! no light here, this book is all just tunnel, really'.If it weren't for the brilliance of your writing Haruki, or the fact that 'what i talk about when i talk about running' is one of my all time favorites, i'd seriously consider not ever picking up one of your books again.But as it stands, I might just give one of your shorter books a chance. Just maybe, at some point in the unforeseeable future. And next time you write a book with a winding pointless plot. Please have the courtesy to keep it snappy.Thank You"
317,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16054419-katerina,Rating 5 out of 5,"Девушка с необычной фамилией Аомаме (Синий Горошек) едет по хайвею в такси на важную встречу, застревает в пробке и вынуждена спуститься по пожарной лестнице вниз, это быстро и просто, только помните, предостерегает таксист, все не то, чем кажется. Мужчина с обычной фамилией Кавана (эээ, ""река, текущая неизвестно куда""?) берется для конкурса отредактировать роман семнадцатилетней школьницы про маленьких незеленых человечков, мир с двумя лунами и Голосами, которые надо слушать. У нее - странное выражение лица, необычное хобби, работа фитнес-инструктором и букет детских психологических травм. У него - широкие плечи, любовь к математике, деспотичный отец и похожий букет, только цветы немного другие. Три тома - история с доказательством о том, что не быть вместе им было невозможно.Когда я лично читала этого Мураками, первые сто страниц ощущала себя снова лет на шестнадцать, когда на мою ""Охоту на овец"" была очередь из однокурсников, а ""Дэнс, дэнс, дэнс"" я дарила подружке на день рождения с трепетным комментарием. Герои-мальчики - привычно простоватые, но добрые и размышляющие, девочки - гордые, одинокие красавицы с придурью, на которых, разумеется, так хочется быть похожей. Детский сад, да и только. Потом привыкла, пообжилась в новой реальности - и понеслось. В мире Мураками, как всегда, происходит куча странных и запутанных событий, которые почему-то воспринимаются вполне естественно, разве что иногда хочется достать карандаш и суммировать кратенько, кто откуда куда и зачем появился. Если называть этот стиль магическим реализмом, то, по мне, такое повествование тяготеет все-таки к реализму - это ж Япония, про них и так ничего не понятно, так почему не поверить в слепую козу (куда, куда делись овцы?!), воздушный кокон и непорочное зачатие, если веришь в банки с горячим кофе, взносы за телевидение и таксистов, подбирающих пассажиров на автостраде? Вот Маркесу я верю с трудом, а Мураками, как Берньеру в его латиноамериканской трилогии, - легко. В общем, три тома - примерно три дня, освободите какие-нибудь долгие выходные."
318,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900800-inderjit-sanghera,Rating 5 out of 5,"There is something quasi-magical about Murakami so that, no matter how many tropes he recycles (diffident male anti-hero, parallel worlds, spunky heroine) the reader cannot help but be drawn into the world he creates, his words acting as a conflagration as the reader becomes enveloped in the often convoluted but delightful plots he weaves. I have commented before that a core theme of Murakami’s work is that of urban loneliness and that it the core concept which Murakami explores here, as the two protagonists, Tengo and Aomame, are consumed by the pain of their childhood separation and unable to form meaningful ties with other people, instead filling the sense of emptiness which has permeated both of their lives with casual sex, as with Aomame and literature, as with Tengo. That is not to say that either character is particularly unhappy, it is just that their lives seem to lack any essential meaning or purpose.It is difficult to talk about the plot without giving the story away, however ‘1Q84’ is the parallel world which Aomame believes she has entered on the way to an assassination, a world which for all intents and purposes isn’t really different from ours, aside from a small few details, such as the type of guns which are carried by police, and other details, such as the appearance of a second moon, which only certain characters, such as Aomame, Tengo and the scurrilous but pathetic third narrator Ushikawa are able to notice. All three are trapped in a zany plot involving religious cults, a fantasy story about mysterious ‘little people’ which Tengo co-wrote, precocious teenagers, sexual exploitation, mysterious dowagers, silent bodyguards and Marcel Proust; so the usual eclectic make-up of a Murakami novel.What keeps the reader going throughout isn’t so much the resolution of the story which, as is often with Murakami doesn’t live up to the grandiosity of the preceding plot, but Murakami’s unnerving ability to keep the reader captivated, frustrated and in awe of the world which he is able to create and share with others."
319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15991190-shashank,Rating 5 out of 5,"[this review was written on amazon initially]I read a Murakami novel like a condensed dream. Not trying to unravel the underlying/hidden meaning of the dream sequences, just staying with the images and letting them move me and reveal their meaning/feeling slowly, even after I’ve finished the book.There are images and “moods” in this novel that will stay with me for years.I'm a big fan and this is certainly one of his best novels, right there with works like The Wind Up Bird Chronicle, Norwegian Wood, and Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World. Like all those works, reading the novel felt like slowly sinking into a well of dreams, and being enveloped in a mood of curiosity and offhand beauty/absurdity.The book was very repetitious and I enjoyed that. It was like listening to a jazz record on repeat for an afternoon. Repetition is a form of making real in Murakami. The meanings are in the images, the images often begin as shadows, the novel takes those shadows and through echoes like a jazz song it breathes life into them: sometimes quite literally as in his book Hard Boiled Wonderland. I also liked how he’s willing/able to tell a simple love story along with the more complex strands.I guess what I resonate with in Murakami's fiction the most is finding reality in simple things [cooking, off hand conversations, relationships, music, art, thinking] in a world that is surreal or hyper real much of the time. Even the surreal when followed deeper always leads to more reality not less in Murakami, you just can't cop out along the way, like how so many other postmodern writers do, and you got to go deep into the well to use an often repeated Murakami image."

321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8201780-stephen,Rating 4 out of 5,"If you have not read Murakami before, do not start here. 1Q84 is a long meandering read with slow moving, overlapping story lines, each with timelines that are frequently out of sequence though not revealed as such until later. The storyline is not complicated and could have been told in half the pages by another author. Sounds bad. Why then do I rate it four stars? Another author could not have produced such a fascinating work. There is something about Mr. Murakami's prose and vision that draws me in and makes his novels compelling. His prose is remarkable. Long passages feel poetically short; spare passages, highly detailed. I never feel like I am reading about a character, rather I am inhabiting that character, not just how they think, but what motivates them at the core. Mr. Murakami's vision is atmospheric. The world of 1Q84 is like or perhaps the same world created in his prior novel ""The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle."" The detective from Wind Up Bird, Ushikawa, in fact appears in both works. You never quite know what is real and what is imagined. The line is subtle and fluid, like walking subconsciously through funhouse mirrors. I could not put this book down and recommend it highly to anyone who has read Mr. Marukami's other works. Reader's of Chang Rea Lee and David Foster Wallace would I think also love this book."
322,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"Wanted to like it. I'm a good reader. I have a Ph.D. In English. I am supposed to like this book, I know, because many other smart readers do. Unfortunately, I found it literally insufferable and here's why: (SPOILER ALERT)The parallel stories between the two protagonists went on for far too long. The repetitions were tiresome and the plot was needlessly drawn out. This is a minor raw considering that it was originaialy published as a three book seriesand was translated into English. There are beautiful moments, elegant and indelibly memorable prose points. However, I found the gender dynamics to be problematic and Freudian-ly wishful. I cannot get past the fantasy of the mother-daughter spilt character as one in which 10 year old girls (whose bodies are physically and reproductively destroyed) RAPE adult men. The descrptions of these forced sexed acts as perpetrated by ten year old girls who are not people but rather an IDEA or CONCEPT or ILLUSION did little to mitigate my unease which later blossomed into outrage.I am not a prude: One need not be to be concerned about gratuitous depictions of prepubescent girls sexually seducing men who are helpless and paralyzed (except for their member).

323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7416346-gerhard,Rating 2 out of 5,"The world's longest minimalist novel, which reads like a weird pastiche of David Lynch and Roman Polanski tropes, with enough weird sex thrown in to make Ian McEwan feel inadequate.Given its considerable length, there are remarkably few characters, making this more of a chamber piece than an epic. However, the handful of characters are sufficiently vividly drawn to grab a reader's attention.Actually, 1Q84 makes for weirdly compulsive, if exhaustive, reading. Murakami is repetitive to a fault; Volume 3 could easily have been jettisoned without affecting the story at all.On the one hand, this feels like an elaborate joke, a structuralist house of cards meant to collapse the pretensions of readers and critics who find significance in anything.On the other hand, this can be read as a straightforward X Files type SF novel dabbling in parallel worlds and string theory.So ... what does it all mean, at the end? Maza, dohta, green moon, air chrysalis, Little People? I don't know, to be honest. Neither does Murakami, I suspect. One just has to go with the flow of this elaborate, frustrating, enchanting and opaque reading experience."

Had this been a short story, I would have hated it a LOT less. Instead, it was 38 discs of listening to the narrator, and the characters themselves, rehash the same things over and over. And over. AND OVER. I listened to this on my commute to and from work for almost seven weeks, and found myself shouting at it on more than one occasion. I'm unsure whether or not my listening to it instead of reading it impacted my feelings on it, but I don't care. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, unless you want to hear a lot about pubic hair and genitals, and have the author beat you over the head with the same three plot points. Did you guys know there were two moons in this world?Well, I do, because they told me ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTY SEVEN TIMES."

A big, thick, dense, detailed story with a handful of interesting characters and a variety of very interesting situations including assassins, literary contests, religious cults, lesbian cops--the list goes on and on. If you are uncomfortable with kinky sex, avoid this book. And I will admit, the story went in directions i wasn't too pleased with, but i suppose doing the unexpected is what makes for a good storyteller. And Murakami is a great storyteller here. Seriously, if you liked Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon or REAMDE you will find a lot to like with Murakami's writing style (or at least the Japanese translation). "

Last year I read the reviews and wondered what the fuss was about - now I know. I don't know where to begin. When I'd finished reading this whopper of a novel it took me two days before I could pick up another book and start reading again, because my head was full of Murakami's weird two-moon world of the novel. Its a fantasy noel (but in a category all its own), its a love story, its the story of a cult, its ... oh its indescribable, you have to EXPERIENCE it for yourself. Once I've recovered, I'll be going to the library to look for more of his books. In a week or two."

It's ultimately a love story, but wears the garb of a thriller/mystery. As long as this novel is, I found myself hoping it would not end too soon so that I could spend just a little more time with Aomame, Tengo, and the many other memorable characters.Had it not suffered from the occasional cliche and the need for editing ... at 1000 pages, there's not much excuse for the repetition that occurs here ... I'd have given it a higher rating. Still, I'd recommend it.SRW"
