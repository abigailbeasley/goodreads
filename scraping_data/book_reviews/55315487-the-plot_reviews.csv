Once upon a time, he was a moderately successful author, but his spark has slowly dimmed and faded as a writer. He finds himself relegated to teaching writing courses that will allow anyone to attend. One day, he meets Evan Parker, a new student of his. Parker has a great idea for a novel, and Bonner agrees that it will be a best-selling book. Fast forward a few years, and Bonner discovers that Parker has died without ever publishing his book. It is a story that just needs to be told! Who better than this has-been author?Oh gosh. I know that people have just been raving about this book, but it just was not for me. This book was overly predictable - There was so much foreshadowing. The pacing of the book seemed off, and I felt that the story should have been more succinct. This book also seems to oversimplify writing. Writing is far, far beyond plot. Great writers are storytellers - they stir the emotions and take you on a journey. They whisper dreams of what might be. They inspire adventures and create ideas to change the world. Philip Pullman once wrote that """"Thou shall not' is soon forgotten but ""once upon a time"" lasts forever."" An author needs more than a decent plot to be a success. What about tone? Character development? Pacing? *Thanks, NetGalley, for a free copy of this book in exchange for my fair and honest opinion.2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta"

He'd always known a good plot when he saw one.
Jacob Finch Bonner is a has-been. His first novel was well-received, but that was years ago and he knows he hasn't come up with anything good since then. He now teaches a writing course. When one of his students boasts to having a plot that will blow the literary world away, Jacob is naturally skeptical. But when he hears the plot, even he cannot deny its power. So what happens next? Best not spoil it by revealing any more.The writing is what drew me in immediately. It's sharp and clever. It's a book about writing a book, managing along the way to poke gentle fun at writers and the publishing industry, and it's all a bit droll. The author includes details from the real world, referencing Macmillan Publishing and Oprah, and even Goodreads gets a shout-out. Those little details all help to blur the line between what's real and what's fiction, which is great fun.This has the format of a story within a story, which gets me every time. I've only read a handful of books done this way, and I've loved every single one. So please, authors, write more of them, because I honestly can't get enough.I found this to be unputdownable from the very first page. There's this urgency there, a tension that stretches so taut, it's hard to look away. I definitely inhaled this book.My only issue is that I saw the big twist pretty early on. It's my fault... sometimes I can't turn off my brain, and it'll just cheerfully supply me with a litany of unsolicited guesses about what it thinks is going on. In this case, it was right. (Shut up, stupid brain!) Also I didn't find the secret plot to be as amazing as advertised and it certainly didn't blow me away.But I read so much of this genre it's hard to surprise me with plots and twists anymore, so feel free to just ignore me on that. In every other way, this story is amazing, and I will be recommending it to pretty much everyone I know. If that isn't a strong endorsement, I don't know what is."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34183387-regina,Rating 4 out of 5,"After finishing The Plot, it seems to me that author Jean Hanff Korelitz has the following:1. A giant set of cojones. To write an actual novel about the plot of a fictional novel that‚Äôs so good it will be a guaranteed best seller, and to include that fictional novel within your actual novel? Yeah, that‚Äôs pretty ballsy.2. Writing chops. This is a well-written *literary* thriller, where form doesn‚Äôt heed to function. Yes there‚Äôs a great plot to The Plot, but it‚Äôs framed with crafty sentences and giant walls of text. Don‚Äôt like page-long paragraphs? Too bad for you. 3. A crystal ball. This novel (and ergo the novel within it) will be a best seller. A worthy one, at that. My thanks to the (ballsy) author and Celadon Books for the advance copy to review via NetGalley.

Somewhat of a slow- burn that slowly turned into a fast tumbleweed that blew me away!!
Once this story took off, I couldn't stop reading to see what was going to happen next. Though it took some time to build up (somewhere around 37%), it was worth the wait! This book was nothing like I thought it would be and I'm happy I read it without knowing much of anything about the plot (other than the title). It builds slowly and adds each layer by revealing secrets that left me intrigued and wanting more.Meet the writer, Jacob Finch Bonner, who learns about a plot for a book that could make him very famous. Problem is, it isn't his story. He writes it anyway.....Someone reads it and another plot emerges and takes over Jacob's every waking moment.Who is chasing who? Its a deadly game.Addictive, unexpected and delicious mystery!Thanks to Celedon books for sending me a review copy! OUT May 11, 2021"

Such an impressive book is questioning how demanding job to be a writer and how much sacrifices you may make or how far you go to create your dream work. A thought provoking approach to be writer and be part of literature industry.I have to admit: this book‚Äôs plot so similar David Bell‚Äôs‚Äù kill your darlings‚ÄùI recently finished. At that book a literature professor plagiarized his missing student‚Äôs thesis and finds himself at the police investigation because his book he‚Äôs inspired by the thesis based on real murder.  There are slight differences about ‚Äúthe plot‚Äùs story: Jake is struggling author and also advisor at a summer college writing program. That‚Äôs how he met Evan Parker, acting like pretentious douchebag and rejects Jake‚Äôs help because that narcissistic guy already found the way to be a bestselling author: he has a brilliant plot idea which is hundred percent guaranteed to be a blockbuster and he spills the bean about the plot line during their conversation. Jake is surely pissed off as he works too hard but nothing creative enough comes out of his mind, a lucky bastard already won the jackpot.  As Jake turns back his downward spiral of self- hatred, lack of creativity, he finds out Evan Parker never published his book he mentioned him. He passed away without leaving any book behind which gives Jack free pass to use the idea at the most creative way to write his masterpiece. If we compare the both books, this one starts like slow burn, informing us the background of Jake: tax attorney father, high school guidance counselor‚Äôs son, has mediocre-at best at PSAT score on the verbal side, raised in Long Island. Even though his math skills were better than verbal ones he insisted to be a powerful author when his father objected him because only Sidney Sheldon can make decent money from writing and he‚Äôs not close to be Mr. Sheldon.  We keep reading Jake‚Äôs struggles to live in NYC, chasing his dream, working at his side hustles which are odd jobs but he has to earn his life.  We also read great criticism about why people choose to be a writer. After the slow burn character analyzing parts later, we witness how Jake‚Äôs life has changed after he finished his book. He found the fame, success, love but also faced with fears, guilt, resentment.  He meets with his wife and it seems like finally he reaches his entire goals in his life till one day an anonymous email blames him to steal the idea which pushes him dig deeper about the dark past of Evan Parker who presumed to be death from drug overdose.  The big difference of this book‚Äôs story with ‚ÄúKill your darlings ‚Äú, Jake didn‚Äôt stake his claim on finished manuscript , he took the idea but he shaped the entire development and conclusion by himself. And the author could not come back from the death to sue him about copyrights. And the second big difference is this book is about telling us how painful and compelling job to be writer even though you work as hard as you can, there is a chance you never fulfill your dreams and you‚Äôre doomed to fail. Second half of the book is more exhilarating, filled with high tension, capturing your entire focus and the realistic approach of the author telling how far you go to pursue your writing dreams was remarkably told. Jake was truly easy to connect and as a writer I truly heard him, felt for him.  Overall: it‚Äôs solid, well written, interesting, well developed and satisfyingly concluded novel which earned my four stars. Special thanks to NetGalley and Celadon Books for sharing this digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions."

Years later he's struggling, working at jobs connected to writing, becoming the clich√© of ""those who can, do, those who can't, teach"". He's his own worst critic, considering himself nothing if he can't write, mired in years long writer's block and incredibly jealous of anyone with current writing success. He really has no interest in anything else but being a great writer and his low self esteem and feelings of dejection lead the first half of the book.¬†To his utter disgust, a disrespectful student of a third-rate MFA program he teaches, shows him several pages of his work in progress, which has a plot that must be told, can't help but be a raging success, and will make anyone who writes the book an instant best selling author. Years later, when the book hasn't been written or published because the student died, Jacob takes the plot for himself, writes a best selling novel, and then basks in the glory while dreading he's going to be found out at any moment.¬†And then it happens, he starts getting texts, emails, and more, from someone threatening to expose him for stealing the story. This is where things get good. Before, Jacob was stuck on his couch, wallowing in self pity, then, basking in the glory of his success. Now he's scared and he's not willing to be exposed,, not about to lose his high standing in the publishing world. I did guess who was sending the threats but doing so didn't diminish my enjoyment of this book in any way. We've been so caught up in Jacob's head and we know that he feels like he ""took"" that plot and we know he's determined to keep the story as his story. But he has his work cut out for him to find out who is threatening him. This is very much a psychological drama, well written, and it kept me glued to the pages to see how it was all going to end.¬†Publication: May 11th 2021Thank you to Celadon Books for the print copy of this ARC.¬†"

This was one of my most highly anticipated thrillers of the year and this book DELIVERED. I listened to this as an audiobook (huge thanks to Macmillan Audio) and I finished it in ONE SITTING. I don't think that's even happened to me before, finishing a 10 hour audiobook in one sitting has never happened but I was absolutely engaged and obsessed with this story and I had to know where it was going.This story follows a professor named Jacob who once had a really popular book published. But ever since he's been trying to write book after book with no success. While teaching his creative writing class he meets a student named Evan Parker who is the most cocky piece of shit ever, and he's convinced he has an idea for a book plot that will sell millions and be turned into a movie, etc. Jacob discovers he's actually a really great writer despite being annoying as fuck, and he thinks the plot is a really great idea. Years go by and he hasn't heard of the book being published, and he finds out that Evan died. He doesn't want the genius plot of that book got to waste, so he decides he's going to write it instead. But someone knows what he did and they are threatening him. This book was so well-written, it was so fast paced and I really enjoyed reading from Jacob's POV. I found him to be really entertaining and interesting, and I love reading books about writers. I also love that in this book we get chapters of the actual book he was writing and we get to see the plot unravel ourselves, and it's a great story within a great story.And that ending!!!!!!!! I will admit, there was one twist toward the end that I kind of saw coming throughout most of the book, but that very last epilogue chapter!!!!!!!!!! I was like bitch whaaaaaaaat. It was so good. So this still gets 5 stars, because even though I predicted one of the twists I was still 100% shocked at the ending!"

The Plot  is about a struggling author who steals a masterful ‚Äúplot‚Äù for his next novel.  A game of cat and mouse ensues between the author and a reader who knows too much, resulting in a dramatic and chilling conclusion. Jake, a writer down on his luck, steals a plot to a novel that brings him fame, fortune, and success, but someone knows his secret and threatens exposure. In an effort to keep his secret, Jake tries to hunt down his adversary, but will they get to him first?This book pulled me in from the beginning. Jake‚Äôs voice had me captivated, which was interesting since I found him bland and ordinary (but I think that‚Äôs the point). He is relatable, and even though he did steal the plot for his novel, I was still rooting for him. For the most part, this was unputdownable, minus the middle (it slows down a bit).I loved Hanff Korelitz‚Äôs commentary on the literary world, which reminded me a bit of A Ladder to the Sky,  but Jake is no Maurice Swift.  The plot which Jake‚Äôs steals is supposed to be the ‚Äúit‚Äù plot leading to movie offers, fame, fortune, etc., but it is a bit of a letdown once revealed. However, the villain is masterful, and they made this book! The final sentences, which should have left me cringing, left me smiling.

‚Ä¶a few minutes later in the car, he found the first of the messages. It had been forwarded from the contact form on his own author website (Thanks for visiting my page! Have a question or a comment about my work? Please use the form!) just around the time as he was about to go on the air with local Seattle institution Randy Johnson, and it had already been sitting there in his own email in-box for about ninety radioactive minutes. Reading it now made every good thing of that morning, not to speak of the last year of Jake‚Äôs life, instantly fall from him and land in a horrible, reverberating crack. Its horrifying email address was TalentedTom@gmail.com, and though the message was brevity itself at a mere four words, it still managed to get its point across. You are a thief, it said.
Buckle up. Jacob Finch Bonner (Jake) had some early success as a writer. His novel, The Invention of Wonder, received critical acclaim, the New York Times including it in its list of New and Noteworthy books. But it has been a while since that critical (if not commercial) triumph. A story collection was largely ignored and then there was, well, nada. Jake teaches at Ripley University in northern Vermont. It is not writer‚Äôs block Jake suffers, it is more like Writer‚Äôs-Great-Wall-of-China. He teaches creative writing, endures the continual delights of academia politics, and lives, literally, on Poverty Lane. But then Evan Parker happens.  Jean Hanff Korelitz  - image from her site - Photo: Michael AvedonAn incoming student, Evan is convinced that he has a perfect plot for a novel. He is insufferable, arrogant, condescending, and clearly thinks that Jake cannot really teach him anything. He does not want to tell anyone the specifics of his work, just get a degree, educational cred, and some connections, figuring that is all he will need. But a time comes when he does share with Jake the arc and some detail of his novel. Turns out Evan was right. A few years later Ripley has down-sized, and Jake is working at a proprietary artist colony. 
All he had ever wanted was to tell‚Äîin the best possible words, arranged in the best possible order‚Äîthe stories inside him. He had been more than willing to do the apprenticeship and the work. He had been humble with his teachers and respectful of his peers. He had acceded to the editorial notes of his agent (when he‚Äôd had one) and bowed to the red pencil of his editor (when he‚Äôd had one) without complaint. He had supported the other writers he‚Äôd known and admired (even the ones he hadn‚Äôt particularly admired) by attending their readings and actually purchasing their books (in hardcover! at independent bookstores!) and he had acquitted himself as the best teacher, mentor, cheerleader, and editor that he‚Äôd known how to be, despite the (to be frank) utter hopelessness of most of the writing he was given to work with. And where had he arrived, for all of that? He was a deck attendant on the Titanic, moving the chairs around with fifteen ungifted prose writers while somehow persuading them that additional work would help them improve.
But when Jake learns that Evan Parker has died, and that his magnum opus appears to have never been published, he makes a decision, backing it up with large volumes of excuse-making and a cyclotronic level of self-justifying spin. Three years later he is on his long-dreamed-of book tour, promoting his hugely successful novel, Crib. He still carries guilt and paranoia about being found out. The guilt he manages (Mr. Bonner, when it pops up, take two excuses in a large glass of entitlement and call me in the morning), but I guess you can‚Äôt be too paranoid. Then the message.This is where the book kicks into high gear. Who is #Talented Tom, how much does he know, what can he prove, what does he want, and what will he do? Is this blackmail? I was reminded of a classic story of guilt and crime. 
...at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears. No doubt I now grew very pale; --but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased --and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound ‚Äìmuch such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. I gasped for breath --and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly --more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. from Edgar Allen Poe‚Äôs The Tell-Tale Heart
An e-mailed threat was not the only thing he left Seattle with. Anna Williams, a fan, the producer at the Randy Johnson show at KBIK, who had arranged for Jake to do the interview, chats him up afterwards. They have a coffee, stay in touch even when he returns to New York, and their connection soon become a thing. The messages do not stop. 
but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed --I raved --I swore!- EAP We ride along as Jake deals with his publisher, his agent, his fans, and his peers. There is a lot of support for him in the community, as most presume it is just a nutter harassing him in search of a lawyer-enhanced payday. But Jake knows this is no gold-digging faker. Yet he still feels it necessary to keep this from Anna for a long time, even after they are living together. Just how dangerous is TalentedTom?
I seem to be attracted to sociopathic male antagonists. I also appear to like college campuses. - from the Scoundrel Time interviewThe engine shifts into overdrive when Jake decides to stop playing defense and begins doing some serious research to identify his tormentor, and learns that his may not be the only theft related to Evan‚Äôs plot.
It grew louder --louder --louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! --no, no! They heard! --they suspected! --they knew! - EAP In addition to Poe, I was reminded of another book-stealing novel of recent vintage, A Ladder to the Sky, with a much more flagrant, and feckless thief. In this one Korelitz drives us through Jake‚Äôs excuses and makes us consider just where fair use ends and theft begins. As one might expect there is a lot in here about writing. Where do you get your ideas? an eternal question, the struggle to create. Coping with a book tour, difficult questions, redundant questions, ignorant interviewers. As this is Korelitz‚Äôs seventh published novel, and I am sure she has motored the book tour circuit a time or six, I expect this is the product of experience. As is her take on campus life, coping with students, and the horrors of faculty politics. Not to mention a writer‚Äôs inner turmoil.
The Plot may seem a little hard on writers, but that shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone; we‚Äôre hard on ourselves. In fact, you couldn‚Äôt hope to meet a more self-flagellating bunch of creatives anywhere. At the end of the day, though, we are the lucky ones. First, because we get to work with language, and language is thrilling. Second, because we love stories and we get to frolic in them. Begged, borrowed, adapted, embroidered ‚Ä¶ perhaps even stolen: it‚Äôs all a part of a grand conversation. - from Acknowledgements The only place I had issues was with the baddie‚Äôs final explanations. I cannot really go into details as it would require significant spoilage, but the motivation for what comes at the end seems thin. A name change might have raised questions at an institution. And one might have expected a greater bit of interest on the part of the authorities after one death, particularly in tracing back a specific person‚Äôs real-world movements, and someone else‚Äôs on-line activity. That said, keep your BP meds handy. This is a tension-filled journey, page-turning wonderfulness, leaving you panting to know what happens next, and unable to turn out the light and go to sleep before you get through some serious white-knuckle twists and turns to arrive at The Plot‚Äôs destination.

Most of us would consider it ludicrous to think a writer owns a plot. But what if someone does not? What if they feel wronged? How far will they go? Writer Jacob Finch Bonner is a sad sack. He was a one-hit wonder, but now finds himself struggling to write anything and teaching at a third rate MFA program. Then his luck turns. Jake seizes the opportunity to take (‚Äòsteal‚Äù?) a plot as his own, a plot so daring and different that it is certain to be a hit. He writes his book, and as predicted, it becomes a huge bestseller. Life is finally looking good for Jake.However, despite the fact that every word of the novel was his own, he lives in constant guilt and fear that his secret will be discovered. And indeed, someone does know. The anonymous ‚ÄúTalented Tom‚Äù (very clever play on words, as the reader discovers), who begins to send him threatening messages. The threats eventually escalate, risking Jake‚Äôs career and future.The cat and mouse games begin as Jake begins to investigate on his own to discover the identity of the person sending him the letters. What follows is a wild ride that ends in a shocking conclusion. Truth really is often stranger than fiction. I enjoyed the plot within the plot with chapters from Jake‚Äôs book. Each entry gets us closer to the truth. As an aside, I didn‚Äôt find ‚Äúthe plot‚Äù to be that daring or different, but maybe that is a bit of humor from the author? Maybe all authors think THEIR plot is revolutionary, when it is not? As in this book, it‚Äôs not the plot, but the way it is told that makes for a terrific read.This was a slow start, but the payoff was worth it. As a buddy read, Marialyce and I enjoyed the author‚Äôs sly commentary on a writer‚Äôs life and the publishing world. Who owns a story? Who has a right to tell it? It‚Äôs certainly a timely topic that begs discussion. Most readers will guess the revelations to come and will wonder why Jake is such a dimwit.

Jacob Finch hit it big with his first novel ‚Äì at least with the literary crowd- garnering him an air of respect. His attempt to follow up with the next great American novel never quite got off the ground. Now he‚Äôs forced to teach to make ends meet. The best position he‚Äôs able to manage is far from prestigious-The MFA program at Ripley College. Here he meets Evan Parker, a narcissistic student who claims to have a near perfect plot, the details of which he refuses to share with anyone- save for a small excerpt. He‚Äôs convinced his novel will put him on the map, will make him a household name- but after a time- the novel fails to materialize. Long after his stint with the MFA program-out of the blue, a niggle of memory causes Jacob to remember Evan Parker, prompting him to do a little internet search.  Shockingly, he discovers Evan has died. Knowing he has no living relatives, the plot of Evan‚Äôs novel begins to germinate in Jacob‚Äôs mind. The next thing we know Jacob Finch has regained his respect, and then some, after publishing ‚ÄòCrib‚Äô, his new novel. He‚Äôs a household name, an Oprah book club choice, and his novel has been optioned for film, by none other than Steven Spielberg. But just as he‚Äôs really hitting his stride, just when his life is really starting to finally come together- professionally, and personally- it would appear that his secret is not entirely his own. It seems someone out there knows that, for all intents and purposes, he stole someone else‚Äôs plot. The question is: Who is taunting him? How do they know where he got the idea for his book, and can he prevent them from blowing up his career and his personal life too? As I was reading this book, I came across an article about an old ‚Äòfeud‚Äô between John Lennon and Rod Stewart, in which the former accused the latter of borrowing a tune from one of their songs. Years later, Stewart addressed the accusation by saying ‚Äòthere‚Äôs nothing wrong with a good steal‚Äô.  Ha! Seemed like an apt quote that went well with this book. It wasn‚Äôt outright plagiarism- but‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a slippery slope. Yet, who is to say two people can‚Äôt have ideas that resemble one another? It happens all the time. As an avid reader, I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve read books with eerily similar- but totally independent- plot-lines. Plus, I‚Äôve seen several household name authors accused of plagiarism- and it does seem like a rite of passage. The situation in this book, is a bit different than simply borrowing an idea. As it turns out, Jacob steps into a quagmire he never could have anticipated. Yet, what is really eating at him is his own guilty conscience, his bruised ego at not having been able to come up with this genius plot on his own. He becomes desperate to discover who else knows about the plot. A relative, a friend, a former student? What do they want? Blackmail? Or to simply out him as a fraud- a washed -up writer who couldn‚Äôt put together an original thought on his own? Either way, Jacob has a lot at stake and his panicked state of mind is palpable. This book has a clever setup, plus, the cat and mouse games are tense and entertaining‚Ä¶ provided one manages to remain in the dark throughout the majority of the story. A huge tip off clued me in early on- and as it turns out it‚Äôs one of those situations, unfortunately, when knowing the twist in advance ruins the entire book. Once the cat is out of the bag that early on-it reveals how one-dimensional the story is. The characters were unable to enlist my sympathy, there was nothing emotional or compelling to make up for the advanced knowledge. Of course, I‚Äôm not psychic- so I continued reading to see how it would all come together in the end.  I also liked the double entendre- with the title- and I thought the author did a great job with presenting the mindset of the author- the inner workings of publishers, publicist, etc. I also thought the ending was darkly humorous- although I‚Äôm not entirely sure that was the author‚Äôs intention. The 'Ripley' allegory was a nice touch, too. Overall, though, despite all the rave reviews for this one, I was underwhelmed and thought the book was over -hyped. Don‚Äôt get me wrong-the book is good for a quick escape, but it‚Äôs just not worthy of such effusive praise. That said, I seem to be in the minority on this one- many people loved it- so don't let me deter you. You might have better luck with it than I did. 2.5 stars "
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19736308-susan-s-reviews,Rating 4 out of 5,"My thanks to the author, publisher and NetGalley for an Audio ARC of of this novel in exchange for an honest review.I truly admired the author's writing abilities and obvious intelligence. I even enjoyed many of the discussions about artistic inspiration and how writers take from and build on other author's ideas and plots. (I cringe every time I hear allegations of plagiarism in either the publishing or music industry. To my mind, hasn't every trope, conflict or life drama been depicted in just about every manner possible by now?) I actually enjoyed this novel very much, but......! As I listened to this wordy, often overly descriptive audio on the unwieldy NetGalley Shelf Ap, I kept thinking ... hmm: very erudite, ""high altitude"" writing style. This won't appeal to everyone - even I found it a tad tiresome at times, hence the one point deduction in my rating.Acquit me! - I love a good discussion about art: the history of, the making of, the talented or eccentric creators of, the feelings and thoughts evoked by, etc. etc. As I audited this book, I often felt like I was back in class, listening to a lecture - but without the opportunity to raise my hand and ask the Prof for clarification or even debate a point. (I also felt the urge to check for footnotes and reference sources, but, alas, this was an audiobook....)The narrator was quite decent and I liked his voice, but I was occasionally distracted by his pronunciation of certain words and would loose the thread of the story. (For example: the main character's name: instead of Jacob Finch Bonner, I occasionally heard Jacob Finch Boner - I kid you not! This is basic phonics, people!) Technical issues aside, this was a pretty decent thriller, but half way through, I knew who the killer was, the why of it and even the how of it, and I could even foretell how the story was going to end - and I knew I wasn't going to like that ending. My take: everything was a tad ""over-explained."" There really was nothing left to infer or guess - all the work was done for the reader. Dialogue and characterization were good, and the various settings were so well described and detailed, you could probably make your way through the halls of the now defunct Ripley college or the small New England towns where the main and side stories took place. This minute attention to detail and the heavy use of elaborate and multi-syllabic descriptors slowed the action down. This entire novel can certainly be made into a movie, but it will be a short movie, because nothing, for much of the novel, happens... just the slow dripping away of all the characters' lives - both fictional and ""sub-fictional,"" and all of those long interior monologues from Jake.Of course, I enjoyed the ""NOVEL WITHIN A NOVEL THAT MIRRORS THE ACTION IN THE MAIN NOVEL"" theme, but this is also what made it so very predictable. Maybe The Plot was never meant to be a thriller in the true sense, but if you were hoping for a shocking twist, I don't know how you couldn't see it coming.I'm rating this one a 3.8 out of 5 because the writing was very good, and I did enjoy the literary discussions, but as a thriller.... well, I'll let you decide, because I do still highly recommend this one!"

He is so protective of it, that he will only share a few pages with his instructor or his classmates. He has even selected a pseudonym, Parker Evan-to protect his anonymity. Years later, Jacob wonders whatever became of this student and his story.

16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a wonderfully intriguing psychological thriller from Jean Hanff Korelitz that immerses the reader into the world of writers and publishing, and aspects that are integral to it, including reviewers, book tours, interviews and fans. Jacob 'Jake' Finch Bonner was once a critically acclaimed author, if not a commercial success, but his second book sank without trace and his other books could not even secure a publisher. He clings onto his past success which has him tutoring would be writers at third rate Ripley College in Northern Vermont but he has little interest in other writers, having to force himself to read his students written endeavours. It is here that he is to fatefully encounter the obnoxiously arrogant and sneering Evan Parker, convinced no-one can teach him anything, reticent about sharing any of his writing, boasting that he is writing a book with a mind blowing plot that will make him the toast of the publishing world, bringing him untold riches, gaining recommendations from the likes of Oprah, and be made into a movie with a A list director and become an all round certain global success story. Jake is initially sceptical, although he accepts how well written the few pages he reads that Parker offers are, but upon hearing the plot, he enviously agrees that his student is right in forseeing an instant bestseller that will take the world by storm. Jake's fortunes continue on a downward spiral in the following years and it is only on meeting a Californian writer that reminds him of Parker that he wonders what happened to Parker, only to discover he had died soon after he had met him without completing his book. Jake takes the plot, feeling a little guilt, and writes the runaway bestseller, receiving critical and public acclaim, and all that Parker had foretold. All that he had ever dreamed of is his, the world is at his feet, until he receives a message from #TalentedTom referring to him as a thief. Terrified of his entire world crumbling into ignominy and public failure, Jake delves into the life of the late Parker to discover who is threatening him. This is a twisty and entertaining read, of murder, deception, lies and family, discussing the moral quandry of helping oneself to the plots of other writers, given that the best authors unashamedly borrow and steal from others. My only gripe with the novel is that perhaps the person threatening Jake is a tad too obvious, otherwise I highly recommend this. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC."

18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113387426-craig,Rating 2 out of 5,"After a strong start, this turned out to be a disappointment. As I see it there are two big issues with it, each having to do with one of the two things this book tries to be: a thriller and a meditation on what it means to say a person ‚Äúowns‚Äù a story.Re: thrills: The premise here is that the writer-protagonist Jacob Finch Bonner has come across a marvellous plot for a novel conceived by a former creative-writing student who never got the chance to write it before he died. So Jake finds himself with a plot which was described to him in apparently extremely thorough detail in an office-hours writing conference (one which may have lasted into the night like Shaffer‚Äôs Salieri giving confession in the institution). And this unwritten plot‚Äîwhich Jake can now write and publish to get himself out of the has-been slump his writing career is mouldering in‚Äîis apparently so much more than just a good, readily available plot for a novel. It‚Äôs apparently something utterly, entirely new, a kind of narrative eighth colour of the rainbow that turns on a plot twist so skull-shatteringly shocking that, both Jake and his late student insist, even if the book wasn‚Äôt written well, it still could not possibly lose and would certainly, certainly become a massive bestseller, a story adapted for the screen by Spielberg, an Oprah club pick, etc. So he writes and publishes it, and of course it does all those things.All due props to Jean Hanff Korelitz here: with a setup like that, she could have been forgiven for leaving the details of the actual ‚Äúcan‚Äôt-lose‚Äù plot in question out of her own story. But the doomed student‚Äôs plot isn‚Äôt like the contents of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction. We do find out in due course what the plot of the novel is, and we‚Äôre even offered excerpts from chapters of it. And while it‚Äôs a potentially successful story with a reasonably interesting twist, it‚Äôs not an eighth colour of the story rainbow by any means, and any chance of it becoming some massive Gillian-Flynn-style earthshatterer would definitely depend on it being executed very, very well indeed. This ‚Äúcan‚Äôt-lose‚Äù plot can definitely lose‚Äîand by being billed as transcendent and showing up as a simple story with a twist, it sort of does here. But what about the story of that story‚Äîof what happens when, fairly early on, someone turns up and threatens to disclose Jake‚Äôs ‚Äútheft,‚Äù and we get to The Plot‚Äôs own plot? That, too, is a story with a reasonably interesting twist, but you won‚Äôt have to be paying careful attention to see it coming, and when it finally arrives you‚Äôll have a long chapter of Bond-villain-ish speechifying to wade through as the book tells you what you already know before winding down to its predictable close. But that wasn‚Äôt even what I found most disappointing about The Plot. In some ways it‚Äôs actually a pretty engaging, well-paced presentation. (Though enjoying its various movements along the way requires ignoring a big problem: Jake spends most of the novel wandering all over hell‚Äôs acres investigating the mystery of this person who‚Äôs threatened to reveal his secret, trying desperately to figure out who did what and how, when all he‚Äôs ultimately doing is following the borrowed plot of his bestseller, which of course he knows perfectly well. He may not know exactly who, but how can he possibly not know what kind of thing this search will uncover?) In the promise of its great revolutionary twist, The Plot writes a narrative cheque that it cannot cash, one that duly bounces by book‚Äôs end, but what‚Äôs wrong with a bit of thriller-fun? Except that the book doesn‚Äôt just want to be that, and here‚Äôs where it disappoints most, at least for me. Re: questions of ownership: This is a novel that quotes T. S. Eliot‚Äôs famous observation about good poets stealing. There‚Äôs mention of literary frauds like James Frey and Clifford Irving. There‚Äôs repeated meditation on the idea that you alone can tell ‚Äúyour story,‚Äù just as you alone can live your life. There are also a few mentions of famous retoolings and retellings of pre-existing stories going all the way back to Homer and all the way up to Shakespeare. And yet there‚Äôs never any serious pressure put on the assumption that Jake has committed some great crime or sin here, and on this key question The Plot never quite gets past (or even really defines the terms of) its own ‚Äúnobody can tell your story but you‚Äù platitude. But what does it mean to ‚Äúhave‚Äù a story? What are the sorts of differences that help to account for the gap between the snowflake-unique stories each of us seems to have and the seven basic archetypal plots that are purportedly all there ever really are? Why especially should telling a story be considered ‚Äúowning‚Äù that story, especially in a world of film adaptations and fan fiction and mashups etc.? As I read I kept thinking that if the novel didn‚Äôt actually have a plot to blow a reader‚Äôs mind with, it must at least come around to exploring these questions in intriguing and illuminating ways, not least because its protagonist briefly raises them himself as he considers putting the ‚Äústolen‚Äù story on paper. But The Plot isn‚Äôt ultimately interested in these questions and never really takes them up past that early point. Jake scrambles to keep what he‚Äôs done from coming to light, but that never seems to have anything to do with fear of the world finding out he can‚Äôt write. Because he can write: he wrote every sentence of the novel. But he still acts with an uninterrogated certainty that he has committed a crime. Has he? What‚Äôs he done exactly? The novel simply waves the question away. But aside from ‚ÄúWhodunit?‚Äù it‚Äôs the main question this book is here to ask, and there aren‚Äôt really satisfying answers to either of them here."

The Clive Cusslers and mom bloggers might still be persuadable that Jake was a famous, or at least a ‚Äúhighly regarded‚Äù young (now ‚Äúyoungish‚Äù) novelist, but the would-be David Foster Wallaces and Donna Tartts who were certainly present in the pile of folders? Not so much. This group would be all too aware that Jacob Finch Bonner had fumbled his early shot, failed to produce a good enough second novel or any trace of a third novel, and been sent to the special purgatory for formerly promising writers, from which so few of them ever emerged. (It happened to be untrue that Jake had not produced a third novel, but in this case the untruth was actually preferable to the truth. There had indeed been a third novel, and even a fourth, but those manuscripts, the making of which had together consumed nearly five years of his life, had been rejected by a spectacular array of publishers of declining prestige, from the ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù publisher of The Invention of Wonder to the respectable university press that had published his second book, Reverberations, to the many, many small press publication competitions listed in the back of Poets & Writers, which he had spent a small fortune entering, and, needless to say, had failed to win. Given these demoralizing facts, he actually preferred that his students believe he was still struggling to reel in that mythical and stupendous second novel.)TLDR: fame, fiction, and revenge.* this is probably too close-reading to be of interest to anyone casually checking out this review to see if they wanna read this book, so i'm plopping it into footnote territory because i appreciate the character-work. this is from an early scene (ARC p 18), at a start of semester barbecue where jake and alice‚Äîthe poetry teacher, are chatting. alice has praised his work and been self-deprecating about her own, and jake thinks she may be flirting. he's a bit dismissive of poetry, but he's all puffed up by her appreciation of his novel, with being ‚Äúthoughtfully admired‚Äù by another writer, and he responds indulgently with ‚Äústudied modesty‚Äù and more than a little condescension until she divulges: ""I‚Äôm starting as an adjunct at Hopkins this fall, but I‚Äôve never taught. I might be in pretty far over my head.‚ÄùHe looked at her, his reserve of goodwill, already small, now swiftly draining away. Adjunct at Johns Hopkins was nothing to sneeze at. It probably meant a fellowship she‚Äôd had to beat a few hundred other poets out for. The university press publication was likely also the result of a prize, it occurred to him now, and just about everyone coming out of an MFA program with a manuscript went in for every one of those. This girl, Alice, was quite possibly some version of a big deal, or at least what passed for a big deal in the poetry world. The thought of that deflated him utterly.oh, that seethe. it is worth noting that in alice's first appearance, she ""looked to be about his own age,"" and in her second, she's a ""woman...standing beside him,"" but then‚Äîtellingly enough, when he feels vulnerable by her accomplishments, he reduces her to a ""girl."" and i knoooow this is third person, but it's a very close third person POV...until it isn't, and that little dig is just jake all over. there's another book on the publishing horizon that sounds like it might be friends with this book: Kill All Your Darlings, and even though i read and didn't love a different book by david bell (Bring Her Home), i really want to read this new one.come to my blog!"

Jake hears the plot and grudgingly agrees. A couple years later, Jake has sunk lower. It dawns on him that he‚Äôs never heard of Evan again, or his book. Researching, he finds out that Evan died a couple years back. Since Evan was so secretive about his book, Jake assumes that nobody else knows the plot.

22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2922102-blaine,Rating 5 out of 5," But there was one thing he actually did believe in that bordered on the magical, or at least the beyond-pedestrian, and that was the duty a writer owed to a story.I received a free ARC of The Plot by Jean Hanff Korelitz from Macmillan in an exchange for an honest review.All Jacob Finch Bonner wanted to be was a writer. He paid his dues, and when his first novel made a modest splash in the literary fiction market, he thought he was on his way. But then his second novel tanked. And he couldn‚Äôt even find a publisher for his third or fourth novels. Which is how he found himself teaching at ‚Äúa third-rate MFA program that nobody‚Äînot even its own faculty‚Äîtook seriously.‚ÄùEvan Parker doesn‚Äôt have any particular respect for writing or writers. ‚ÄúI just care about the story. Either it‚Äôs a good plot or it isn‚Äôt. And if it‚Äôs not a good plot, the best writing isn‚Äôt going to help. And if it is, the worst writing isn‚Äôt going to hurt it.‚Äù But what he has is a bulletproof plot for a novel that will be the next mega-hit, one of those that come along once or twice a decade and explode:  Presumed Innocent,  The Firm,  The Da Vinci Code,  Gone Girl. As much as Jake detests Evan, when he hears the plot, he knows Evan is right.But the novel never gets published, and when Jake finally digs into why, he learns that Evan died just a few months after they met. And Jake decides that the plot is simply too extraordinary not to be written. So he takes the plot, writes his own novel (he had only seen a few pages of Evan‚Äôs first draft), and it becomes the Oprah-loved, Spielberg-movie, multi-million copy selling smash that he could have only dreamed of. And his life is pretty perfect, until the first e-mail arrives accusing him of being a thief... because maybe there was more to Evan‚Äôs plot than Jake ever realized.I had a lot of thoughts as I read The Plot. Jake rationalizes using Evan‚Äôs plot, yet upon being accused of being a thief, he feels and acts guilty. But is he? Certainly you can steal the text of a novel, but that didn‚Äôt happen here. Can you steal an idea or a plot? And if he was really worried, why didn‚Äôt he just dedicate the novel to Evan, and say that he‚Äôd done his best to honor the idea that Evan had told him? Maybe I just don‚Äôt know enough about plagiarism. But I‚Äôm 100% sure that Evan is 100% wrong that that a good plot can‚Äôt be ruined by bad writing. Let 1,000 people read one of those books I listed above, then give them a year to write their own version of that book from memory, and I‚Äôll bet you couldn‚Äôt get through the first three chapters of at least 90% of the copies. Writing is hard, and a successful book works because of the marriage between the story, the writing, and the times.But I eventually stopped thinking so much about those ideas, and became absorbed with the story itself. Jake is a well-developed character, and his insights into the world of being a writer were entertaining. The book-within-a-book technique‚Äîalmost required given the story‚Äîis very effective. As Jake begins to learn more about Evan‚Äôs past, we get snippets from Crib, and each unsurprisingly sheds new light on the other. In fact, my only real critique of the book is that, given that he already knew the plot of his own book, Jake probably should have figured out what was going on faster than he did.So could the The Plot be the next mega-hit? It has all of the ingredients. It‚Äôs got a good plot with some nice twists, is well-written, has some interesting ideas going on, and seems primed to appeal to those in the grip of the current obsession for mystery thrillers. Perhaps most of all, the book builds to a legitimately great ending that I may never forget. Highly recommended.5/11/2021 update: reposting my review to celebrate that today is publication day!"

I found the writing to be very good in spite of the slow beginning. It took a while to set up the foundation for what was to unfold. I did not find it to be ‚Äúbreathtakingly suspenseful‚Äù as the blurb suggests, it‚Äôs much more of a slow buildup.Jacob Bonner is a 40 ish writer who had a one time promising career. He wrote a novel that did quite well but then his second novel didn‚Äôt take off and the third novel, well he couldn‚Äôt even find a publisher that would take it.Jacob finds himself teaching a creative writing class at a 3rd rate MFA program in Vermont. We join him as he is getting ready to greet the next class of prospective writers and he isn‚Äôt very enthused about it.Then he reads a few pages of Evan Parker‚Äôs submission. It is clever and the plot is really something he has never read before. He has some further discussion with Evan about what will unfold next in the story. Evan is narcissistic, doesn‚Äôt accept suggestions or criticisms. He knows that this novel will be a huge hit. But Evan never finishes the manuscript as far as Jacob knows. He actually disappears from campus and Jacob doesn‚Äôt know where he has gone or what he has done. Jacob kept waiting for this novel to surface but it never does. Jacob actually struggles with the thought of writing a novel with this plot. Who actually owns an idea? He justifies his use of the plot because he believes that ‚Äúif you did not do right by the great story that had chosen you, among all possible writers, to bring it to life, that great story didn‚Äôt just leave you to spin your stupid and ineffectual wheels. It actually WENT TO SOMEBODY ELSE. A great story wanted to be told . . . AND IF YOU WEREN‚ÄôT GOING TO DO THAT, it was OUT OF HERE, it was going to find SOMEBODY ELSE WHO WOULD!The less you know about what unfolds the more you will ENJOY the story. I use that word a bit loosely because THE PLOT itself portrays the story of a woman who is inherently EVIL, with no moral compass or thought of anything except what she wants!!I was thankful to read this novel with DeAnn and Jayme who helped me get past the first half!This novel is set to publish on May 11, 2021I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss."

Stepping into Jean Hanff Korelitz‚Äôs literary world, was an ‚Äòhonest-to-goodness‚Äô crazy fun thrilling ride. It‚Äôs not completely without flaws....but there are moments of brilliance that make up for them. I enjoyed the entire exploration about people who write books....their passions, urgency, arrogance, insecurities, drive, goals.... etc. It was interesting to think about creative writing MFA programs....and why some writers bond with other writers, and why some never will. Class was underway at Ripley Symposia‚Äôs first-year prose workshop. Parker speaks out... ‚ÄúI just care about the story. Either it‚Äôs a good plot or it isn‚Äôt. And if it‚Äôs not a good plot, the best writing isn‚Äôt going to help. And if it is, the worst writing isn‚Äôt going to hurt it‚Äù. Jake (the teacher), responds: ‚ÄúDo you have a plot in mind?‚Äù ‚ÄúI do, said Parker, with now overflowing hostility. I prefer not to discuss it. He looked around. In this setting‚Äù.  ‚ÄúI suppose, Jake said, that what we need to know, then, is how I‚Äî how this class‚Äî can best help you improve as a writer‚Äù. ‚ÄúOh, said Evan Parker, I‚Äôm not really looking to improve. I am a very good writer, and my novel is well on track. And actually, if I‚Äôm being honest about it, I‚Äôm not even sure writing can even be taught. I mean, even by the best teacher‚Äù.  ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôd obviously disagree with that, he said trying for a laugh‚Äù. ‚ÄúI certainly hope so! Said the man from Cape Cod‚Äù.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm curious, said the woman to Jake‚Äôs right, who was writing a fictionalized memoir about her childhood in suburban Cleveland, why would you come to an MFA program if you don‚Äôt think writing can be taught? Like why not just write your book on your own?‚Äù  Well‚ÄîParker shrugged‚Äî‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ‚Äòagainst‚Äô this kind of thing, obviously. The jury is still out on whether it works, that‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm already writing my book, and I know how good it is. But I figured, even if the program itself doesn‚Äôt actually help me, I wouldn‚Äôt say no to the degree‚Äù. Minutes went by‚Äînone of the students spoke‚ÄîJake said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to hear you‚Äôre well along on your project, and I hope we can be a resource for you, and I support system‚Äù. From the start, I enjoyed the dialogue, the mysteriously interesting characters.... the way they presented themselves versus their inner opposite selves. ...A thriller develops. ...A writer dies....A novel is stollen......Plagiarism is revealed but...not before walking down many different paths of possibilities as to why and by who....Fabulous beginning. Exceptional ending!Parts of middle the section, is where I started to drift off.I felt the book might have benefited with some tighter editing. But ‚Äòoverall‚Äô .... the greatness far out weighed the mediocrities. ‚ÄúThis story will be read by everybody. It will make a fortune. It will be made into a movie, probably by somebody really important, like an A-list director. It will get all of the brass rings, you know what I mean?‚Äù ‚ÄúAnything can fail. In the book world? Anything‚Äù. Terrific book choice for fiction readers, literary readers, and mystery thriller readers. I enjoy 75% of it a lot!!4 strong stars."

I'm more the kind of person who likes to sit back and be entertained. Surprised. Shocked even. It's the same with mystery novels. Give me a twisty story, and let me enjoy it as it unfolds.So, a book about a book with a killer plot? Strap me in for the wild ride!Except, well, it really wasn't. The main character, Jacob, is a sad sack, a real nothing. He's the kind of guy I might meet somewhere, and forget the moment he was out of my sight. As for respecting him? He was that dud, the one who does nothing to elevate himself, but keeps wondering why he's going nowhere. And the plot? Even I knew what was coming, and I hate guessing ahead. It was annoyingly predictable from the beginning. Overall it was a decent book, but nothing special. I wouldn't recommend rushing out to buy it, but if you find it free or at the library, it would make a decent beach read this summer."

It took me about 60 pages in before I felt any connection to this story. I might have put this aside if I hadn't gotten that warning and that would have been a shame because this was really well done. Who owns the plot to a story? That's the question we ponder through out. Jacob Finch Bonner meets an aspiring writer - albeit an arrogant aspiring writer - at an MFA program he's teaching. Said writer, Evan Parker / Parker Evan, claims he has a plot like no other. One that is sure to skyrocket him to fame in the literary world. He holds the details close to his chest but lets Jacob see a small snippet. Just a few pages, really, and Jacob is gobsmacked that this idiot actually has something here. Something that could be HUGE. Fast forward four years and Jacob is riding high on the success of his latest novel, Crib. That is until he starts receiving threatening messages accusing him of plagiarism and theft of plot. After the slow start this turned into a heck of a fun ride. I have to admit that I did figure out the *who* early on which normally would have annoyed me but not the case here. The writing was so addictive that I didn't even care that I figured it out. To watch all the pieces come together in the end was so incredibly clever and satisfying. I am not at all surprised to see this book getting the attention that it's getting as it is well deserved. 4 stars! Thanks to NetGalley and BookishFirst for my copy."

Now available as of 5.11.21 and now available in paperback!**ANYONE can be a writer.At least, that's what the students at Jacob Finch Bonner's seminar believe. Although Jacob has been slogging along since the publication of his first book, desperately searching for the next great idea and for purpose in his life, teaching this band of misfits wasn't exactly what he had in mind. One aspiring writer in particular, Evan Parker, has too much 'tude and not enough talent...at least, at first glance. Once he reveals the plot of his novel-to-be, Jacob is stunned, baffled, and knows a winner when he hears one. This plot has NEVER been executed before, and for a literary aficionado like Jacob, the very essence of this story crawls under his skin and never fully goes away. Years later, stuck in another hardly-literary-but-it-pays-the-bills job at a hotel, Jacob discovers that Evan Parker has tragically passed away. But that story. That one-in-a-million PLOT. Does IT really need to meet a similar fate?Jacob decides the world needs to hear it, and quickly crafts a best-seller called Crib. As his popularity explodes, he finds himself name dropping celebrities, a member of Oprah's exclusive pantheon of authors, and with a Spielberg development deal. All of this newfound glory, however, comes screeching to a halt, however, when Jacob receives an anonymous message from online from ""TalentedTom"" (a nod to Patricia Highsmith's The Talented Mr. Ripley) saying he knows Jacob has stolen the plot and that this wasn't his story to tell. Jacob is desperate to keep his secret safe, and enlists the help of his publisher and relies on his own detective work to draw him closer to the informer so he can prevent his own ruin. But has Jacob become so caught up in trying to furiously tie up his own loose ends that he has bypassed the glaring truth entirely?Korelitz is a Literary writer (with a capital L!) and this was evident from the very first page of this fantastic book. This book is rife with commentary on the literary world, what it means to be a writer, what it means to be a TRUE original, and literary references GALORE (including one very overt Charles Dickens reference that made me smile!) I always love a book that can serve several functions, and this one absolutely fits the bill. Aside from all of this book talk, Korelitz also manages to weave an incredibly compelling and suspenseful narrative that starts slow, but by about 50% is going full-throttle. I had such a hard time putting this book down, even for a minute! I have to be honest and say that I did figure out the ending partway through, but surprisingly, this almost made me want to finish the book even faster because I just wanted to see everything play out---and WOW, did it ever! The hidden double meaning of the title is just the icing on the cake for this one and proof positive that Korelitz really DID think of everything! (If only all of her characters were so astute!) üòâI had such a great time reading The Plot and the juxtaposition between commentary on the ups and downs and ins of outs of the book world and the slow-building tension of an intriguing and thrilling mystery was just the rejuvenating breath of fresh air I needed for Spring 2021! 4.5 couldn't-put-it-down ‚≠ê!#theplotbook #CeladonReads #partner"

I am sure it will bore most people, maybe even some writers and those who work in the publishing industry.Jake has written a highly successful novel that he based on a plot written by one of his students. The student is now dead, and Jake has rewritten the story. Jake did not really steal it from anyone, but he feels that he did. So does someone else who is badgering him online about it. Who is this? That‚Äôs what Jake sets out to learn.I read several good reviews of this book before I decided to read it. I feel cheated.

I loved it and I loved the narrator, Kirby Heyborne, whose voice I recognized immediately as the narrator who hypnotized me in Kubica‚Äôs Don‚Äôt You Cry. Jake Bonner is an author whose first novel was reviewed favorably in the NYTimes Book Review, where he was labeled, an author to keep your eye on. Several years (book rejections) later, he is on the Ripley College writer‚Äôs workshop circuit, a misanthrope charged with mentoring a ragtag group of wannabe authors. He drives an old car, still uses the same natty (rhymes with?) furniture from his college days and, in general, fits the description of an altogether, self-deprecating sourpuss.Enter younger narcissistic nemesis (NN), Evan Parker/Parker Evan, whose sole purpose, it seems, is to yank Jake‚Äôs chain. Puffed up NN, disparages all around him, including Jake, and boasts that he has come up with the ultimate plot that will catapult him into Stardom ‚Äì Best Seller, Agents & Publisher, a spot on Oprah Winfrey, lecture and interview circuits, Movie rights and let‚Äôs not forget a copy of his book on the table in the entrance of every book store. Tightlipped NN will not give away anything about his plot, yet at some point he can hold it in no longer and spills the beans to Jake, in the privacy of his office. Jake is gobsmacked, he knows that all the rewards NN claims he will reap from publishing his novel will come true for him‚Ä¶(circa) Four years later, Jake has dropped down to the lowest levels of the food chain, when he notices that NN‚Äôs book has never been published‚Ä¶he learns that NN actually died several months after attending the Ripley College Writer‚Äôs Workshop. Jake weaves NN‚Äôs plot into a book. The words are entirely his, as are character and plot development. As far as he knows, Jake is the only person who ever heard the plot from NN. Jake writes the Novel that catapults him into Stardom ‚Äì Best Seller, Agents & Publisher, a spot on Oprah Winfrey, lecture and interview circuits, Movie rights and let‚Äôs not forget a copy of his book on the table in the entrance of every book store (did I just plagiarize, er, repeat, myself?). Jake finally becomes a grown-up at the age of 30-something. He meets and marries the girl of his dreams, who changes his life (not to mention the furniture, dishes, and glassware). She feeds him lots of green soup and boy does he lap it up. His life is now meaningful and happy. Sourpuss is now the picture of contentment - hahahah, tell me you don‚Äôt see it coming‚Ä¶. Ooo eee, ooo ah ah ting tang, Walla walla, bing bang‚Ä¶. he wasn‚Äôt very smart (oops, there I go again, forgive me David Seville/Ross Bagdasarian).Everything comes crashing down around poor Jake as the first (of many) message(s) arrives from Tricky Tom. (Our author joins me in my newfound infatuation with Patricia Highsmith.) Did Jake or did Jake not plagiarize Evan Parker/Parker Evan‚Äôs book? Not every idea you throw out into the air can be claimed as your intellectual property‚Ä¶and you cannot plagiarize something that has never been published (published does not necessarily mean printed). Too bad Jake didn't have confidence in the merit and integrity of his work. To legally discredit Jake, ""Tom"" would have had come forward and expose the source of the claim, which would likely have been impossible since the manuscript was never published - if it existed at all. Possibly, there might have been a breach of confidence, but heck, the guy whose confidence may have been breached is too dead to sue. Let me set your minds at rest, plagiarism will make for a great debate in a book club, but it is not really the issue here, there are other issues at play. I mean, like what's with all that green soup wife keeps making and Jake keeps slurping? I looked up what green symbolizes in literature...are we talking guilt, greed, jealousy? Whose?I figured out who Tom was pretty early-on, but I confess, I should have expected (but did not) the PH-ish ending.

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,Rating 4 out of 5,"Jacob Finch Bonner had fallen on hard times. His first book was a moderate success, but book two was a flop and books three and four can‚Äôt even get published. He‚Äôs been reduced to teaching at a third rate MFA writing program. There, he encounters Evan Parker, the most obnoxious person anyone could have as a student. Evan is convinced he‚Äôs got the next best seller, on a par with Gone, Girl. When he dies later, never having published his supposed masterpiece, Jake steals the idea. And sure enough, the book is a colossal success. Then, the emails from Talented Tom start coming, accusing him of being a thief and a fraud. The theme of the book is who owns a story. This idea has been tackled before, even Mark Twain said there‚Äôs no such thing as an original idea. I liked that the book paints a very ambiguous story. This wasn‚Äôt a case of out and out plagiarism. Jake ties himself in knots explaining his own actions to himself. The book starts off slow and takes a while to really get going. The chapters interlace Jake‚Äôs life with chapters from his best seller. It would never be called fast paced. But there‚Äôs a nice underlying tension throughout and I was really curious to see how both stories would play out. I had a pretty good idea early on who Talented Tom but it didn‚Äôt dampen my enjoyment to be proven right. I was really impressed with Kirby Heyborne as the narrator.

Being a sucker for books about writers and their process and day to day problems, I really enjoyed this one. This is an in-depth look into plagiarism and how the theft of another writer's idea effects the thief. There are pages of text addressing how this person justifies what he has done and you almost start to believe it too. Jacob Finch Bonner is the writer. He is so pretentious that he adds ""Finch"" to his name from Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird. Ugh! Bonner has gotten to the bottom of the literary barrel and has no more ideas to write about. He discovers by chance that a student who had a great plot died without writing his sure thing and so Bonner decides to steal his dead student's great idea. I was ready to be wowed by the magnificent plot, but it turns out that wasn't the major twist of this book. The plot in question is only humdrum to my mind and has been done before. So, I don't know what all the hullaballoo was about in that instance, but the author of The Plot has a major twist that you don't see coming and I really was gobsmacked by it. All in all, a tasty little treat with a marvelous cherry on top ending."

The book centers around a novelist, Jacob Bonner, who writes a book using the plot of another author‚Äôs novel, who died before he was able to have his book published. When the book becomes an immediate best seller, the author does an outstanding job conveying the dread and worry that Jacob lives with in fear that he will be discovered as a fraud and thief. The book hits some very rough patches as another mystery unfolds which could destroy Jacob‚Äôs professional life. Jacob‚Äôs luck running into random people in hugely populated towns that know exactly the information he needs to further his investigation is second to no other book I have ever read. Also, the author‚Äôs description of the plot of the book that Jacob wrote is supposed to be so amazing and original that the book becomes an instant bestseller; it definitely does not rise to that level in the book excerpts the author includes in ‚ÄúThe Plot‚Äù. However, even with these and other problems, the book kept me interested throughout and even finished with some very nice unexpected plot twists that made ‚ÄúThe Plot‚Äù an enjoyable read that I would definitely recommend."

Had I not known that ahead of time I might have given up. After 50 pages or so the story really hits its stride and ended up being a fun read.After Jacob Finch Bonner published his first book it garnered some praise. His second book failed to draw any attention. To his utter dismay, he's stuck teaching in a MFA program in order to pay the bills. One of his students, Evan Parker, fits the definition of arrogant but surprisingly he came with an extraordinary plot for a novel. Jacob knows when the book is published it will set the world on fire and become a bestseller. Years later, Jacob wonders why Evan's surefire hit was never published and that's when he learns Evan died awhile back. Hmm... it'd be a shame for Evan's incredible story to go to waste...What I loved about this book, The Plot, is how the author created a tension filled thriller involving the publishing world of all things. It was an edge of your seat type read and given it revolves around writing, I just don't think it is a small feat to be able to pull that off. It was unconventional and creative and I was amazed I was able to maintain such a high interest level in the story once the ball got rolling.Now, the ending didn't exactly pack as strong of a punch for me because I had pieced together a few things ahead of time. I'm not going to give myself a pat on the back though because a lightbulb went off in my head for one thing literally a few pages before it was revealed in the story. And the ending does go in a direction that I did find surprising. Thank you Celadon Books for sending me an advance copy! All thoughts expressed are my honest opinion."

I found the writing to be very good in spite of the slow beginning. It took a while to set up the foundation for what was to unfold. I did not find it to be ‚Äúbreathtakingly suspenseful‚Äù as the blurb suggests, it‚Äôs much more of a slow buildup.Jacob Bonner is a 40 ish writer who had a one time promising career. He wrote a novel that did quite well but then his second novel didn‚Äôt take off and the third novel, well he couldn‚Äôt even find a publisher that would take it.Jacob finds himself teaching a creative writing class at a 3rd rate MFA program in Vermont. We join him as he is getting ready to greet the next class of prospective writers and he isn‚Äôt very enthused about it.Then he reads a few pages of Evan Parker‚Äôs submission. It is clever and the plot is really something he has never read before. He has some further discussion with Evan about what will unfold next in the story. Evan is narcissistic, doesn‚Äôt accept suggestions or criticisms. He knows that this novel will be a huge hit. But Evan never finishes the manuscript as far as Jacob knows. He actually disappears from campus and Jacob doesn‚Äôt know where he has gone or what he has done. Jacob kept waiting for this novel to surface but it never does. Jacob actually struggles with the thought of writing a novel with this plot. Who actually owns an idea? He justifies his use of the plot because he believes that ‚Äúif you did not do right by the great story that had chosen you, among all possible writers, to bring it to life, that great story didn‚Äôt just leave you to spin your stupid and ineffectual wheels. It actually WENT TO SOMEBODY ELSE. A great story wanted to be told . . . AND IF YOU WEREN‚ÄôT GOING TO DO THAT, it was OUT OF HERE, it was going to find SOMEBODY ELSE WHO WOULD!The less you know about what unfolds the more you will ENJOY the story.

It was fun playing detective along with Jake trying to figure out who was messing with him. Although predictable, it was such a fast-paced and fun story throughout. The author has such a unique and fun style of writing so I appreciated that as well.

The Plot is a fantastic read and absolutely has the potential to be one of my favorites of 2021.
So, why only four stars, Bridgett?There are a few reasons:1. The writing is very stylistic. I actually love the sentence structure Jean Hanff Korelitz used, but for the first couple chapters, it was a little hard to become absorbed into the story. After that, I guess I adapted, because it wasn't really an issue.2. While I liked Jake's character, I also found him to be a little...bland. He had zero affect and wasn't terribly fleshed out. Same with Anna.3. I figured out the 
BIG
, final twist pretty early on. While the clues and red herrings were very well done, for me, it was still obvious. And this, fellow readers, is the main reason this book isn't getting five stars from me. There were still a few little surprises thrown in that I didn't catch, but for me, that didn't make up for the lack of a surprise ending. Despite all those issues, I still loved this book. It was structured beautifully, and, as a writer, I could relate to so much of the content. This will definitely be a top ten read for me this year, I have no doubt. Recommended, my peeps!

If the box has your name on it, do you own each one separately? Better yet, do you actually have the rights to all the various hues contained within? Well, does anyone?A perplexing thought in regard to what is ours in life. Do we have complete ownership of our thoughts or do we loosely leave them along the wayside in conversations and discussions where they can be snatched up and pocketed by others?Jacob ""Jake"" Finch Bonner is facing such a dilemma. Jake is teaching Creative Writing at the Ripley Symposia in northern Vermont. His claim to fame is a one-hit-wonder novel from some time back. As the years pass by, so do the accolades. Standing in his doorway is one of his students, Evan Parker. Evan is filled with himself and filled with an abrasive personality. He claims to have the all and end-all plot for a bestseller. Jake leans in, but he's met with ""Anyone can write"" by the rude Evan. And yet Evan's attempts at writing are limited, but oh, how Jake remembers the crusty elements of his idea. Evan never completes the assignment.Years later, Jake has presented a new bestseller entitled Crib. He's sought after for book tours and even Steven Spielberg has obtained the movie rights. Although every word is his.....""ideas"" may be counted on like low hanging fruit. Perhaps like Eve's tango with the ol' apple. And as of late, Jake begins to receive emails from a mysterious ""Talented Tom"" accusing him of thievery. Jake is hesitant, but he informs his publisher and agent. Jean Hanff Korelitz provides us with an interesting dialogue in regard to literary property. Both legal and the publisher seem to scoff at the assertions. Jake is not so sure.....The Plot will take us on a road trip initiated by Jake in the hope of revealing the accuser. Prepare yourself for a bit of dryness in the opening chapters which convey a bit of stiffness surrounding the publishing world and novels in progress. It's this road trip that will reveal Jake's inner turmoil over his good name and reputation as a writer. ""Talented Tom"" will be sucking all the oxygen out of the room from here on out. We'll be brainstorming along with Jake. Jean Hanff Korelitz does a fine job of showcasing her main character of Jake and all the backstories involved. The storyline is a clever one and the tension heightens all the way to the finale. Even if you see it coming, you'll just sit back and absorb all the craziness of it.

And I don‚Äôt mind that, I like the idea that I‚Äôm somehow getting a glimpse inside a writer‚Äôs head, that I‚Äôve been granted an opportunity to unpick the craft in some minor way. In this story, the author introduces us to Jacob Finch Bonner, a man who‚Äôs wanted nothing else than to be a successful writer for as long as he can remember. He‚Äôs had some success too, with his first book receiving quite a bit of critical acclaim even though sales were only modest. But his follow-up books failed miserably and as a result he‚Äôs now he‚Äôs taken up a job teaching an MFA course at third-rate school, just to make ends meet for a while. But then he gets lucky.The luck involves his coming across a brilliant, can‚Äôt fail plot for a book, courtesy of one of his students. But it‚Äôs not his plot, is it possible that he can steal this idea and run with it himself? There‚Äôs a lot more to this conundrum, of course, but I‚Äôm not looking to share any of that here. Suffice to say that Bonner wrestles with this dilemma and the choice he makes shapes how his future is to play out. It‚Äôs a well-crafted and suspenseful thriller that definitely had me hooked from early on. I liked the way that Bonner was brought to life, even though I‚Äôm not sure that I actually liked the man very much: most of the time he comes across as a self-obsessed loner who really has little time for anyone else.My main issue with the book is that I worked out the key twists to come about two thirds of the way in, something I rarely do. I didn‚Äôt know exactly how it was going to play out but I had the bones of in my head from that point. This somewhat took the edge off the remainder for me as I started to spot what I saw to be confirmations of my predicted route. However, despite this there was still enough mystery left in the detail to hold my interest and, in truth, there was at least one significant element I that hadn‚Äôt foreseen that definitely startled me. When I try to analyse whether this could play out in real life I conclude that there are just too many elements that I believe would have derailed the whole thing along the way - but as a piece of entertainment it did have a lot to offer. I enjoyed it and I think a lot of other readers will too.My thanks to Faber & Faber and NetGalley for providing a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."

Now though I've read a few fiction that have changed that, this being one. Thought the narrator did an excellent job and I think that helped draw me into this story. Though I didn't like it as much as some of my friends, I did enjoy the storyline, albeit the slow start. Once it took off though I enjoyed the mystery, search and the question of morality on which the story hinges. Is it okay to steal an idea for a story? A story, within a story in which I unfortunately guessed the who in the who done it, way before it was unveiled. At that point I asked myself if I would have put the book down had I been reading instead of listening? Possibly, as I am still having and possibly judging too harshly these psychological mysteries. This though was a little different which I appreciated, but much enhanced by my listening experience.ARC from Netgalley."

Jake is teaching a joy he initially likes but after some years finds himself bored and stumbling.

He allows Jake to read a few pages of his story and Jake acknowledges this impudent man cocky and pompous has a sure to be winner on his hands. Jealousy sets in as he waits for this book to be published and his novel to be eclipsed. However, that evet never happens and Jake is perplexed and beyond curious. He finally learns that Even Parker has died presumable from a drug overdoses and since there no family well the temptation to ""borrow"" the deceased plot idea takes root.As Jake's new book storms onto the best seller lists of many publications, he meets a woman who eventually becomes his wife, but then an email arrives accusing him of plagiarizing the book and Jake's trip into the nightmare zone starts.

Jake is terrified and decides its time to delve into Evan Parker's background and the surprises keep coming.Although this book has quite a slow start, it builds momentum as we journey along to puzzle out the details of deception and lies. At times, it is a bit of a puzzlement why Jake takes this so seriously as he just seems to have taken the plot but written the story himself, and yet he does. As he delves deeper into the actual Evan Parker, he finds that as the old adage goes, life imitates art this time with dire consequences.Thank you to Jean Hanff Korelita, Celadon Books, and NetGalley for copy of this interesting story. Jan and I enjoyed this story that did seems to pull us in after a slow beginning. We were intrigued by Jake and his seemingly unsure about his own innate ability. He was definitely the polar opposite of Evan Parker, his future student. We also talked about in this time of so much controversy, who exactly is ""permitted"" to tell a story?

49,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I‚Äôve read one book per week over the last four years, and I can safely say that this is one of the worst books I‚Äôve ever read. Before I get into specific complaints (and spoilers), I first just want to beg you not to waste any time, energy, or money on this book. Trust me, it‚Äôs not worth it. It‚Äôs not even interesting in how bad it is. It‚Äôs a thoroughly bland and underwhelming book.***SPOILERS AHEAD***1) To start with the most obvious point, the story hinges on believing that the titular plot idea is in some way revolutionary and inherently engrossing, when in fact, it is actually completely uninteresting and unoriginal. Here is the totality of the plot idea: A jealous mother kills her daughter and assumes her identity. As if that hasn‚Äôt been the basis of a dozen expendable, interchangeable thriller novels.2) The book occasionally has opportunities to actually cultivate thematic depth, but it basically ignores all of those chances. For example, Jacob‚Äôs sudden success as an author provides fertile ground for exploring the nature of fame and the hollowness of desires for notoriety, money, etc. However, the novel mostly evades all interesting or meaningful questions, instead focusing on hollow, formulaic plot points. I‚Äôm not saying that mystery books and thrillers can‚Äôt be thematically rich. On the contrary, some of the best novels ever written are in those genres. But this novel is not interested in actually attempting to say anything.3) The twist of Anna‚Äôs true identity is thuddingly obvious. Anna‚Äôs entrance into the story is extremely ham-handed, and pretty much all of her words and actions might as well be big neon signs that say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the bad guy!‚Äù Unfortunately, it‚Äôs clear that her identity is meant to remain a surprise until the final chapters, but it most definitely is not. This twist has also been done so many times before, and in much better ways. The book even references another book (Gone Girl) that has a similar twist, and which employs the twist in a much more effective and original way.4) The slow revelation of the titular plot serves only to hide information from the reader and to cover up plot holes in the novel itself. For example, as soon as Jacob realizes that Evan based his plot on real life, Jacob should have logically concluded that Dianna killed Rose and took her place.5) The characters in the novel are all very one-dimensional. Additionally, Jacob‚Äôs characterization sometimes changes dramatically, simply to fit various plot conveniences. For example, Jacob is generally portrayed as a bland, bumbling, everyman-type character, but in one scene, he instantly becomes a master at manipulating other people. (It‚Äôs the scene with the Georgia lawyer. To make matters worse, this scene is pretty much completely unnecessary.)6) If given any thought whatsoever, the success of Anna‚Äôs evil plan after the publication of Crib is incredibly improbable, far beyond suspension of disbelief. For example, it hinges on her successfully seducing Jacob and manipulating him into marrying her very quickly, without ever raising his suspicions. Her plan only works because the plot requires it to, and because Jacob is not a character, but rather just an engine for the plot (like every other character in the book.)7) Here‚Äôs something that‚Äôs admittedly a nitpick, but it‚Äôs representative of some of the carelessness that‚Äôs evident in the book‚Äôs overall construction. There‚Äôs a character introduced near the beginning who seems like she might be important, but she never reappears after the scene in which she‚Äôs introduced. I‚Äôm not sure she even has a name. She‚Äôs a new faculty member at Ripley, and she even seems to flirt with Jacob a little. She has no evident purpose in terms of plot, theme, characterization, or anything else. And then she just disappears from the story as quickly as she appeared.8) The last third of the book is mostly comprised of a boring slog of generally empty and uninteresting conversations between flat characters. These scenes add nothing to the book other than to stand in for Jacob‚Äôs ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù of the mystery. The story dispenses clues at random to occasionally advance the plot.There‚Äôs more, but the above points cover most of it. I lastly just want to reiterate my point that the experience of reading this book is in no way interesting or satisfying. Not even in a so-bad-it‚Äôs-good kind of way. The relative popularity of this book is frankly kind of distressing. I‚Äôm genuinely sad that this is apparently what people want to read. I can only hope that people are reading this book because they were suckered in by good marketing, and that they‚Äôll soon realize they were sold a false bill of goods. Moreover, when/if this book is adapted into a movie (as the author and publisher so clearly hope) then the wider public will have a chance to step in and say, ‚ÄúHey, this is terrible.‚Äù (See also: The Girl on the Train.) At the very least, this book gave me an opportunity to exercise my critique muscles. And surely whatever book I read next will seem like a masterpiece by comparison."

He‚Äôs now teaching writers courses at Ripley Campus in Vermont where the obnoxious young man reluctantly shares his plot with him and Jacob knows, he just knows it in his bones, that it is amazing. This is a book about a book ..... and I imagine we can all work out where this is heading!! Yes indeed, plagiarism. This is an extremely well written and cohesive novel which starts slowly but picks up momentum and you find yourself totally immersed. Jacob is clearly a clever individual and although he‚Äôs likeable, he doesn‚Äôt have a huge personality but this may very well be the entire point the author intends. His feelings of guilt and the terror of discovery with the fear of being unmasked are well conveyed and oddly, you root for him! As threats come from an unknown source he is dogged in his research and pursuit of the truth which is beyond his wildest imagination. Whilst I do figure out who the masterful manipulator is fairly early on, this in no way detracts from the enjoyment of this skilfully written plot. What plays out becomes a really deadly game and Jake is most certainly being toyed with like the proverbial cat with a mouse. I love the chapter headings which are clever and excerpts from Jacob‚Äôs book, ‚ÄòCrib‚Äô. The ending is excellent and very entertaining and you read with baited breath.

I kept putting it down and doing other things and then reluctantly picking it back up. About halfway through it definitely gets better and picks up steam and so I read the second half much more quickly.There really aren't any likable characters in this book, but that was honestly all right in the context of this novel. I like how we get into Jake's head and his spiraling after he's accused of plagiarism (which I also found to be bizarre because can you really plagiarize a plot? And how many details could Evan really have told him to make them so similar?) and how he goes off on an armchair detective pursuit of the person who is making the accusations. I did figure out a couple of the twists ahead of time, but overall the plot of The Plot (ha) is pretty intriguing and entertaining.As an aside, I didn't find Jake's book and the storyline (can't keep saying plot over and over again) to be that ""shocking"" and ""stunning"". I kept waiting for the big reveal of this amazing stolen plot and when I finally read it I wasn't blown away. However, when all is said and done and the pieces are slotted together in The Plot, and then we get to the very end, the way Korelitz puts it all together makes for a book worth reading. If the beginning wouldn't have been such a slow, dragging setup I probably would have rated it higher. I encourage readers to pick this one up to experience it for themselves, because it is decently good.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own. "

This plot, being withheld from the reader at this time, is made out to be so incredible, so genius, never having been told before, that the student as well as the protagonist are convinced that it is a ""sure thing"", sure to be a bestseller, the one book everyone and their illiterate uncle will read. The protagonist goes as far as to proclaim that anyone could write that book and be successful, no matter how bad of a writer they are. Surprising to no one, the student dies and our protagonist steals The Plot. Everything turns out as predicted; the book is a mega-hit, the protagonist gets propelled into superstardom.

That's the never-done-before twist of the century. Something no one has even remotely thought of. I shouldn't have been disappointed. I mean, had Korelitz actually thought of a super duper amazing story, she would've just written that instead. Do you see how this book doesn't work in and of itself?And then there was the so-called twist I had seen coming from the time a certain character was introduced. The whole book was like a box of chocolates: building unrealistic expectations and then leaving me disappointed and slightly disgusted once I had finished it.

Make no mistake, if you take something someone else has written and try to pass it off as your own, that is plagiarism. But, can you steal a plot? Are there original ideas left in the world?The first half of this book was a bit slow going, but once Jacob starts getting messages claiming he is a thief, the pace and intensity pick up. We get to read a few sections from the blockbuster book itself and that was a fun element of the book. There were definitely some great twists in this one, a few I guessed, and a few that were surprises. The ending boosted my overall enjoyment of the book!I received a free ARC from Macmillan in an exchange for an honest review."

I was captivated from the very first page of this book, which is not shy about its homage to the Talented Mr. Ripley. But, there‚Äôs a difference between homage and stealing, right? At least, that‚Äôs what Jacob ‚ÄúFinch‚Äù Bonner, a novelist with only one obscure book under his belt, tells himself when he stumbles upon the plot of a lifetime. But it‚Äôs not his. It‚Äôs a story told to him by one of his writing students, who dies before he can write the book.So, if Jacob just steals the plot, but writes the whole book himself, it‚Äôs not really theft, is it?Fast forward a few years and Jacob is the toast of the town, having written the book with the plot that captured the world‚Äôs attention. But of course, someone knows and is sending threatening missives to expose him. Will Jacob get away with it?I gobbled this book up in 24 hours. Like the plot of the book at its center, it is delicious and shocking and fun. One problem I sometimes have about authors who write about writing ‚Äî they will characterize their characters work as spectacular, and then they‚Äôll present the thing the character supposedly wrote, and it‚Äôs not spectacular. So all along I was worried this magical ‚Äúplot‚Äù that captivated the world would end up being a disappointment. It wasn‚Äôt! It was great, and it was also tempered by Korelitz‚Äôs sense of humor and some fun wordplay. No spoilers - but let‚Äôs just say the title of Jacob‚Äôs fictional book and the book you are reading have something in common! You get to read chapters of Jacob‚Äôs book parallel with the plot of this book, and that is extremely fun and deftly done.For lovers of a good plot (me, please!) - this book delivers. And the writing is good too. I didn‚Äôt realize initially that Korelitz had written the also-great You Should Have Known, but if you know that going into this book, it makes reading about this fictional author even more fun.Big thanks to Celadon Books, Jean Korelitz abd NetGalley. I had nonstop fun with this one! 4.5 stars rounded up for ... two great plots."

61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5/5 STARS!Happy publication day to The Plot! THE PLOT is a beautifully written mystery/thriller that had me guessing almost all the way. Jean Hanff Korelitz is going on my ""must read"" authors list! Jacob Finch Bonner is struggling as a writer. His first book was a modest success, but in some ways, that makes writing the second more difficult. He's now written a second and a third, but neither one was accepted for publication, so now Jake is teaching at a small college in Vermont. One of his students, Evan Parker, stands out because of his arrogance and attitude. One day in what amounts to a student-teacher conference, Parker tells Jake the plot of the book he wants to write, and Jake finally understands where Parker's arrogance comes from. The plot is AMAZING and will most certainly be a best-seller. Jake moves on, waiting to hear news regarding the publication of Parker's novel, but he never does. A few years later, having heard nothing, Jake searches for Evan Parker and found that he died, never having published a word. What do you think Jake did then? What any writer would do, of course! What happened after that? You'll have to read this to find out! I listened to THE PLOT on audio and at first, I didn't think I'd be able to finish it. Seriously, this book has a very slow start. I didn't care for the narrator at that point either. A few Goodreads friends warned me of the slow start and advised me to try and hang in there because the payoff was *chef's kiss*. I'm glad they warned me and I'm happy to report that they were right. The narrator ended up growing on me quite a bit as more characters and voices were introduced. What I did like, right from the beginning was the author's writing style. The first part of this book is a lot of ""telling"" and even though I didn't much care for that, I can still respect how well it was written. Once the story gets moving though, the writing really shines and here's the kicker: not only is she telling Jake's story, she's telling the story that Jake wrote, based on Parker's idea. So, there are actually two stories here, with chapters of Jake's book CRIB, intermittently sprinkled throughout. Somehow, Ms. Korelitz manages to do this so that the storylines between the two are correlated and it makes for very fast paced and intriguing chapters.The plot for...well, THE PLOT, is an intricate wonder and I found myself guessing almost to the very, very end. I'd say I guessed correctly around the 70% mark, but I did doubt myself. Around the 90% mark is when I knew I had guessed correctly. I did not see all the twists related to my theory, so even though I did guess the perpetrator, the denouement still held a few surprises. I was not familiar with this author prior to this book, (I thought.) Then I discovered that the HBO series I watched called THE UNDOING was written by her, and that show was a trip! THE PLOT would have been a perfect 5 star read for me, but I deducted half a star for the slow beginning and because I did guess who the bad guy was beforehand. Still, I rounded it up to 5 stars here at Goodreads and I'm pretty sure this book will make my top ten of the year! Highly recommended! *Thanks to MacMillan Audio and NetGalley for the audio download of this book in exchange for my honest feedback. This is it!*"

63,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39272121-marilyn-trying-to-catch-up,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Plot by Jean Hanff Korelitz was an extremely clever book. Jean Hanff Korelitz was a new author for me but based on this book I would definitely read other books by her. I listened to the audiobook that was well narrated by Kirby Heyborne. The Plot could be described as a psychologically suspenseful novel. It explored the morals of writer‚Äôs plagiarism. What would you do if you were given the privilege of listening to a plot for a book from one of your students and were convinced along with your pompous student that it would become a successful, best selling novel? That was the dilemma Jacob Finch Bonner faced. He was teaching a writing course at a small unknown master‚Äôs program when this happened. Jacob had written two novels already but he was experiencing writer‚Äôs block when he tried to write his third book. He never forgot the plot of the story his disrespectful student told him during office hours so many years ago. Jacob continually watched for the book to be published but it never materialized. As Jacob dug further into his student‚Äôs life he discovered that his student had died. At that point, Jacob made the decision to borrow the plot and write the book himself. It was an instant success as he knew it would be. Jacob became a celebrated and well accomplished author. Jacob never stopped looking over his shoulder, though. Would he be accused of stealing someone else‚Äôs story?The plot was a fast paced, page turning book. I could not seem to stop listening to this book. It was suspenseful but a little too predictable. I guessed the ending well before it was presented. The characters were well developed and complex. Jacob may have been too trusting and a little naive but likable. I really enjoyed reading The Plot and would recommend it very highly.Thank you to Macmillan Audio for allowing me to listen this advanced copy of this audiobook of The Plot through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

It is here that he discovers the plot to end all plots. Unfortunately, it is a plot concocted by an arrogant cocksure student. There is more wallowing and then things change. The author pens a wildly successful novel catapulting him to unimagined success. Then things change again. There is a great deal of tension as the main character finally stops his wallowing as he tries to find out who is threatening his success. Authorial angst abounds as does the concept of who owns a free-floating idea. I vaguely recall Elizabeth Gilbert discussing the appearance of an idea which stays with one writer for so long before it flits of to find another writer willing to write it. Woo Woo? Sure, but I‚Äôm a reader not a writer so what do I know. Oh! I know that this is a sure-fire bestseller."

So to discover a novel about a down-on-his-luck, once-successful author stealing another‚Äôs plot and the consequences that come with this, had me requesting this book immediately. Jacob ‚ÄúFinch‚Äù Bonner, a once successful author, is now working at a literary programme on a small college campus. Here he has to read other student-writer hopefuls work (which he hates doing) and giving them tips. When a student arrives called Evan Parker, a self-confident, sort-of-an-asshole, tells Jake about his plot, Jake (and Evan already) knows that this is unique and will become an instant best-seller and success.Switching to a few years later Jake is still in a rut with his writing and life when he remembers this student- what ever happened to him? What happened to his novel? And from there he steals the plot and publishes his own.Bathing in his success, Jake starts getting anonymous emails- someone who knows his secret- and from this point, Jakes mental anguish and trying to discover who this person is consumes his life.It was fascinating to see the investigation Jake does to find the truth of who is threatening him and finding more about his ex-student. As things unravel, Jake learns where the plot originally came from and this investigation I really enjoyed. The author here does well to plot the narcissism of Jake to begin with and the self-frustration at not being able to write a new book and lack of ideas. I would say that this was a slow burning novel (which isn‚Äôt for me) but the novel does pick up around 60% when move things are uncovered and then I wanted to read more.I did unfortunately guess the ending quite early on in the book so there was no sudden ‚Äútwist‚Äù that I usually love from thrillers. Also the beginning of this book seemed to have lots of exclamation marks for some reason. They were used at points that I didn‚Äôt think were necessary- but I think that‚Äôs just me üòÇüôà I am not a writer but the over-use of exclamation marks at the beginning did keep throwing me off."

He is scraping together a living teaching writing and editing books. Evan Parker is one of his most arrogant students. He is certain that he has a unique plot that will be a sure fire hit, with a twist that will shoot his writing career into the stratosphere. After Evan dies, Jake takes the plot and writes Crib which in fact does become a huge success. It gets Jake a movie deal, a contract for further books and a wife. After a while, Jake starts to get anonymous messages accusing him of theft. The messages are followed by an online campaign with the same accusations.

There is zero suspense until the last 5% of the book, and that is pretty tepid. This is an entertaining book with a nice twist at the end. I liked the way Evan's plot was doled out over the course of the book. However, a lot of the book is slow. Also, why do authors think it‚Äôs OK to write books full of whining about how hard it is to write books. Do their readers/customers really want to hear that? Lots of jobs are hard.

68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,Rating 4 out of 5,"***NO SPOILERS***What‚Äôs considered plagiarism in the literary world? Where does one draw the line? In The Plot, Jean Hanff Korelitz wants to get readers thinking about this, and she does it in the character of Jacob Finch Bonner, a novelist who wrote a hit book in the past only to follow that with a few misses. To make ends meet, Jake is unhappily teaching creative writing, which he doesn‚Äôt believe can actually be taught. When he‚Äôs not teaching, he‚Äôs trying to write a new hit book but is frustratingly stymied by writer‚Äôs block. With a voice that‚Äôs honest and wry, Jake is authentically human. In the opening pages, readers learn that he nurtures bitterness over his circumstances but puts up a serene, satisfied facade. This changes, however, when the story soon fast forwards a few years to show how he‚Äôs finally published that elusive hit and has transformed into someone humbly confident and grateful. But he‚Äôs not allowed to bask in the glow for long thanks to a vengeful someone out there: the sinister ‚ÄúTalentedTom.‚Äù I loved The Plot for its intelligent story told in casual prose and for the character of Jake. As someone who likes dialogue-heavy stories, I appreciated Korelitz‚Äôs fine-tuned ear for dialogue and Jake‚Äôs point of view. I liked the story-within-a-story structure, particularly Korelitz‚Äôs skill in ordering the two stories so they unfold in tandem to reveal important information. I even liked how the title has multiple meanings. However, the book is a little simplistic despite its stand-out complex traits. The cast of major characters is small, making the mystery feel basic. For a mystery, it‚Äôs also just too...taut: It doesn‚Äôt go in exciting winding directions or get itself in a bind. In the course of Jake‚Äôs investigation, helpful clues fall right into his lap, and pieces of the puzzle lock into place too neatly as the story marches toward a twist that becomes predictable several chapters before its reveal. Pacing is very steady and the plotting singularly focused on the mystery, but this book isn't high adrenaline so may feel slow in comparison to numerous other mysteries. The drawbacks aren‚Äôt exasperating, dumb drawbacks, though; they aren‚Äôt deal-breaker drawbacks. The journey to get from beginning to end is still really fun. Even predicting the twist doesn‚Äôt dampen enjoyment because, although significant, the twist isn‚Äôt the be-all, end-all of The Plot. Interest simply shifts to watching Jake himself discover it and then seeing what comes next. This is a page-turning read with its own identity. It isn‚Äôt unique‚Äìvarious iterations of the premise have been done before‚Äìbut it doesn‚Äôt devolve into clich√©, and it‚Äôs different enough to feel fresh. I probably won‚Äôt remember every single detail of the intertwined stories, but I will remember how nice it was to read a mystery with many more strengths than weaknesses."

Can one author appropriate a ‚Äúplot‚Äù idea legally? Korelitz does a great job providing input for both sides. In America, we‚Äôve seen music artists taken to court for stealing another musician‚Äôs music. Some authors have been taken to court for stealing book ideas, but generally the original plot books have been published previously to little fanfare while the alleged ‚Äústealing‚Äù author makes a best-selling novel. In this story, however, there is an idea that is never written by the person with the concept.Jacob Bonner is a struggling author who is a has-been. He wrote one novel that received much press. His following two works were published and were disasters. Jacob is now a professor at a third-rate college working with student writers who want to publish novels. It is there that he meets an unlikable and obnoxious man who claims he has a plot idea that is so fantastic that even a bad writer will make it into a best-selling book, which will eventually become a film. I, as a reader, beg to differ. I don‚Äôt care what the plot is, bad writing will be the death of the novel. But I digress. Years later, Jacob is still teaching and another obnoxious student piques his memory of his previous student. He googles the guy‚Äôs name and discovers the guy died shortly after he was a student. It‚Äôs been years, and no book was written. Jacob uses the plot idea and writes a novel that is loosely similar to the original plot.Of course, the book is a best seller, and Jacob has sold the film rights. He gets trolled by someone claiming he stole the novel, causing Jacob to emotionally unravel.Pieces of Jacob‚Äôs novel which is entitled ‚ÄúCrib‚Äù are included in the novel, dispersed between chapters of Jacob dealing with the stress of writing another novel and the person trolling him. I found the idea of examining what is an author‚Äôs personal property interesting. If an idea is never written, who can claim that the idea was stolen? What if the idea was telling someone else‚Äôs story without their permission? Aren‚Äôt some of the best novels ones that we can relate to because we have seen the situations/characters/plots in true life, making it realistic fiction? Now the part of this story in which Jacob unravels is where it fell apart for me. I easily guessed who the troll was, so I was not surprised. I‚Äôm assuming many felt the same way. Also, Jacob was realistically written until the troll started hounding him. I didn‚Äôt understand or could empathize with his behavior of trying to find out who the troll was. But then, reality can be stranger than fiction.I‚Äôll remember this novel for its exploration of what an author owns, whether ideas are written down or not. This was not a case of plagiarism, as the novel was written by Jacob. Plus, he loosely based it on the idea of someone else, someone who died and never wrote the story. My disappointment was in how easy it was to figure out who was trying to blackmail him.That said, I do recommend it as a fast and interesting read. Plus, this is well written."

Because heaven forbid a reader know exactly what you're doing from, oh, say page 50 on, if the ENTIRETY of the remaining book only exists to have this one big twisty moment in the last 10 pages. Because IF that's the case, then said reader will be wondering why they read 300 pages of 'who gives a shit' to get to the last 10 pages in which, yes, there it is, the big twist that we saw coming from 250 pages back.Look, I'm not saying ""twist"" books don't have merit if you know what's coming. The journey, often, is more important or as important as the ending. BUT, if your journey does nothing but tease the big twist at the end, and in itself has no interest or entertainment value or merit, than you need to understand it's going to annoy a LOT of readers who see the unbelievably obvious twist you are setting up for 250 pages.I'm sorry if this review is more of a rant, but please understand I spent three days flipping pages, annoyed and bored out of my mind, saying: ""please don't do what I know you're going to do, please don't do what I know you're going to do, please don't... GOD DAMN IT.""Because THAT means the book was a waste of time.Okay, here's the reality. The first 50 pages are excellent. Tight, intriguing, and actually unexpected. But the rest of the book is supposedly some sly wink of a setup that thinks it's being insanely clever when in fact you and anybody with half a brain will know is leading to only one possibly ending.Spoiler? Yeah, not really.The only thing remotely shocking about this book is that she ended it with a much darker note than even I had anticipated. So maybe that's the twist?Thriller writers, take note: Don't write around the twist. Write a great book. If it has a twist, great. If the twist doesn't work, who cares, because you wrote a great book. But if your ENTIRE book only exists to feed up one small moment that is supposed to blow the reader away and absolutely does not, then please rethink writing the book.Does any of this make sense? Probably not, because I'm annoyed and drunk. But good lord, you guys, find another book to read.This marks a big fat Strike Two on my latest thriller reads (The Maidens was also a waste of time). Which means don't trust the big publicity machines. Go read Laird Barron or S.A. Cosby or Joe Lansdale, somebody who can tell a story that doesn't make your entire experience hinge on one page of GOTCHA that you saw coming from the start. Because there's no point, is there?Not recommended. Ignore the Stephen King blurb on the cover."

I liked how informative this book was. The pace picked up when samples of stories were introduced, especially the story titled Crib. The horror of someone knowing the author's secret was a nice push, made me want to turn the pages. This book definitely answered many of my asked and unasked questions about writers, publishers, and readers including reviewers. I'm glad to be informed as an early reviewer.‚Ä©This book followed Jacob aka Jake, a once well-known author, told in the third person point of view as he arrived at his office looking hopeless. His new job was a teaching position, a writer teaching students to become a writer, except he's not motivated to do the job because his own writing career has been receiving rejections after rejections since his first book was published years ago. One student, Evan Parker, had an idea for a story that was self-proclaimed mind blowing and after much persuasion, Evan finally told Jake about it. Jake thought that it will be the best story even though he hated to admit it. Two years later, Jake found himself yet again with a new job, but this time at a small town. There, he met a fellow writer that acted like Evan and the memories about Evan and the book idea returned. He decided to look up Evan and the book but found out Evan died and couldn't find the book had been published. Three years later, Jake published a book with the idea he stole from his student, Evan. He became wildly successful as he always imagined but also terrified that someone will find out that the idea wasn't his. The inevitable happened when Jake received an email from an unknown person accusing him of being a thief. This book was divided into four parts where there's a title for each chapter summarizing what's to come.‚Ä©The Plot was well written with a unique idea I have not encountered before. I rarely able to guess who the killer was in thrillers but in this story, I was able to. I enjoyed both stories very much: the book and the story within this book. I was sad for the ending though because I do liked Jake and would prefer him to have a happy ending. The big reveal was great but I was hoping Jake would realize something was amiss sooner. The epilogue was okay only because the character was not my favorite. Overall, this mystery thriller was definitely an interesting read and I do recommend everyone to read it.‚Ä©xoxo, Jasmine at www.howusefulitis.wordpress.com for more details Many thanks to Celadon Books for sending me a copy of The Plot in exchange for an honest review.

I think the problem is that I read many mysteries and I figured this out too soon also, there was one thing I just didn't buy (okay, I'll spoil this one: a plot so perfect poor writing can't ruin it), one situation that is never explained and some of the ending that the more hours after I've read it elapses, the more I'm like ""I know you said it's like that... but is it though?"". To the good, this was a quick read. If I'd had time to just sit and read all the way through, I imagine this could be a one-sitting book. I definitely wanted to know how this was going to end, so points for that. I thought it began quite cleverly but after the 25% mark when I suspected how the die was cast on how this was going to play out, it just didn't quite hold for me. I really liked the use of the ""book within a book"" but didn't find the interior book to be gasp-worthy as the readers in the book's universe do. YMMV. I found the discussion about who owns and is allowed to tell a story compelling and I very much feel the murderer doesn't own it any more than their victims, and I'm totally fine with pretty much anyone other than the murderer telling a fictionalized account of it, for financial gain or personal furtherance.I think it's going to be a smash for vacation reading and I think that's great. Completely random cool thing, there's a description of what sounds like a lovely spinach soup & now I want to make something just like it... minus one ingredient included in the book of course.

When Jake realizes the reason Evan never published the novel, he does and it becomes a best seller. Someone knows that Jake stole the plot and threatens to expose him. Perhaps my expectations were a bit lofty for this one. I was drawn to the book within a book premise, and overall I thought it was well done. It started off good for me, but then unraveled a bit. In my opinion, the plot was not all that original and definitely didn‚Äôt live up to Evan‚Äôs claims. Secondly, I am probably one of the worst detectives ever despite all of the mysteries and thrillers I read and yet I was easily able to figure out where this was going and even guessed the mystery person. Lastly, the manner in which everything came out in the end is one of my least favorites and felt very abrupt. Overall, 3.5 stars because I did mostly enjoy it and it kept me entertained. "
76,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,Rating 4 out of 5,"This author it masterful at writing around voids. Internal voids and plot voids both. Her style pulls the narrative to intensity pitch after a slow and wordy/erudite start which is highly deceiving both in category (mystery/whodunit) and pace. Yet the carved and nervous tenseness arrives much earlier full strength than in other novels or works of this sort. Here she nails attitude, IQ brilliance of overlook, and essential parts of their emotional cognition to a 5 star degree in at least 4 characters. This is a supremely dark book. Let me warn first. Much darker than the first 60 pages would lead you to warrant.There is a skill here with character plummeting that translates to visuals too here- this novel will most probably be made a movie. Or even a short limited series. I would not be at all surprised.I read this over a period of about a week (that is much slower than usual) as it was busy planting time. But it gave my little grey cells time to posit about it while doing physical work. Regardless, I had a HUGE inkling by page 122-126 how this was. The who for sure and the where and how less sure. But I was right about 2 out of 3 of those prior and ""missing"" aspects. So the last parts of this book were not as loaded with shock value to me as it seems they were to others. Being old, and reading too much? Well, when an author spends so much (too much) time on certain descriptions of ambiance or nuance or physical appearance to make sense? It's a red flag (nearly a red herring in reverse) for me. What is that trying to obscure?This could easily be given a 5 star rating. The writing prose forms and switch features to another ""book novel copy"" are not too frequent or confusing of pronouns either. Like a talented illusionist performing for the staring audience, the eye or mind or emotion are diverted here repeatedly. It's done well.The author also put in a few cheap shots that were beneath her and this body of work. Not just to the politico but to the ""writing about writing"" teach and do skills. It also rather detracted from Jake's personality analysis / background/ mindset, IMHO. But that's the times we live in. They are tawdry.Only read this book if you can tolerate Godless, insipid, faithless to mankind on the whole souls. For much of it, you think it is about writing and writing skills or how people form ideas, but it is actually at a much lower scale of operations than those.Lastly, and this is a semi-spoiler if you saw the limited series The Undoing with Nicole Kidman. All the way through this book it started reminding me of that exact New York city couple, but he was a doctor, a surgeon. Well would you believe after I had finished and read the acknowledgments- I read the back leaf page. And she is the SAME author of that plot too. I don't have those channels but watched it on Watchathon week last year because it was 6 or 8 episodes, very short for such a high end series. But some part of me recognized that particular brand of intimacy ""kindness""? Well, she writes extremely dark individuals but in a very high end intellectual and world placed way. At the beginning of this read I thought this reminded me of Weight of Ink. In fact, it is almost polar opposite to that. This will be popular."
77,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta,Rating 4 out of 5,"Jacob (Jake) Finch Bonner is a writer and published novelist whose first book reached critical acclaim but not the commercial success he‚Äôd dreamed about. His second book didn‚Äôt reach the level of the first and so he began teaching in an MFA program at Vermont‚Äôs Ripley College that even he knew wasn‚Äôt highly regarded. Jake was also struggling the past few years to find inspiration for his next book when one of his students, an arrogant and narcissistic young man named Evan Parker, declares he doesn‚Äôt need his or anyone‚Äôs help because the plot of his book is so compelling, it will become an immediate bestseller on its own. Evan won‚Äôt share more than a couple of pages with Jake but it‚Äôs enough that he becomes highly intrigued with the beginnings of the plot. A few years later, another student with Evan‚Äôs personality traits triggers Jake‚Äôs memory and he searches to see if that much touted story ever got published. When he discovers that Evan died a few weeks after he left Ripley, Jake ultimately convinces himself that he can pursue writing the story himself. It does become that predicted commercial and financial success and Jake's name is right up there with the well known authors of the day. But as he‚Äôs enjoying all that comes with fame and critical acclaim, he receives the first of many messages to come from an anonymous sender called ‚ÄúTalented Tom‚Äù who simply states, ‚Äúyou are a thief.‚Äù Jake‚Äôs private search sends him on a journey into Evan Parker‚Äôs past that produces astonishing results. Let me first warn you that this story requires your patience as it takes some time to develop but there is a payoff for your efforts. When it finally takes a turn to the point where it‚Äôs hard to stop reading (or in my case, listening), the foundation that was created provides that insight into the characters you‚Äôll need to keep up. To make matters more interesting, the story transitions between Jake‚Äôs present day movements and excerpts of his book. Those transitions were well crafted as they become more meaningful as Jake delves deeper into Evan‚Äôs life. But the most compelling aspect of the story is the question it raises about the ownership of an idea. Jake had only a fragment of Evan‚Äôs story premise but was it enough to be considered a theft of someone else‚Äôs story? You‚Äôll be left to decide that for yourself. I listened to the story and it took me a moment to adjust to the narrator because he was so low key. But, after a bit I realized he was just being Jake who consumes most of the beginning of the book and he did that very well. When other characters emerged, there was quite a distinction. I‚Äôm really glad I chose to listen versus read because he helped build the excitement and intrigue, especially that twisty ending. I also have to admit to having guessed the surprise revelation but not the ending. I enjoyed this slow burn novel with the provocative proposition about what constitutes theft in the writing arena. You‚Äôll have to consider decide for yourself. And, the journey to get there was delicious.Posted on Blue Mood Caf√©(Thanks to NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for my complimentary copy.

Although I'm not an aspiring writer, I do free-lance work for a company and have been told too many times to count that I should write a book. As if! Although the main character often says anybody can be a writer, I have read or attempted to read too many books that prove the opposite. Jacob ""Jake"" Finch Bonner is a writer who met with success by making the ""New and Noteworthy"" column of the New York Times with his first novel. Unfortunately, his second and third attempts were not as successful so he turned to teaching at a third-rate MFA program. One of his students, Evan Parker, an arrogant jerk, has a self-proclaimed ""sure thing"" whose plot he shares with Jake. Jake agrees it's a certain hit. As time passes but the book fails to be published, a curious Jake finds out that Evan has died and has left the door open for Jake to appropriate the plot. Life for Jake changes on a dime. His book is everything he thought it would be: number one on the NYT best seller list and movie rights optioned with an A-list director. Life couldn't be better. That is until he receives an e-mail saying he is a thief. The attacks continue to be more specific and more public and set Jake on the path of discovering who is behind these attacks.This is a great suspense thriller. The pacing is good, the story original and the insights into writers and writing are enlightening. I did figure out early on who was behind the attacks, but how the story unfolded kept me reading.

79,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21413858-k-j-charles,No Rating,"Failed novelist steals a brilliant plot from his now-dead creative writing student. It becomes a huge hit. But then he starts getting threatening messages from someone who's found out. This is well written and absolutely conveyed the nightmarish sense of being stuck in your wrongdoing with no way out. But I couldn't get past two aspects of this. 1) He was always going to get found out. If the student was prepared to tell a creative writing tutor he didn't respect or like his entire plot, you would have to assume he told it to other people. I mean, the hard part is getting unpublished authors *not* to tell you their entire plot. Stealing it was dumb as a box of rocks. (Especially given the premise that it was going to be an Oprah-level mega hit). Of course someone out there would know. I don't know how it works out, I DNFd, so maybe nobody knew and it's actually a crazy person accusing him and his sense of guilt will ironically be what betrays him? But even if that's the case, you would *have* to assume someone else knew.2) The guy *stole someone else's book*. Not an idea, not a title: he stole the whole damn book. He stole a book. I hope his hair catches fire. As such I couldn't feel any sympathy at all for the MC, which pretty much torpedoed my engagement with the story since it's very firmly located in his head, so bailing about 30%. Possibly I'm being extremely grumpy about this. Certainly if you like thrillers with unlikeable protagonists--The Talented Mr Ripley being the obvious parallel--you'll probably love this, but I'm not in that sort of mood. "
80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407123-pat,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars rounded down.With every book there has to be an outlier review and in this case it my unfortunate duty to be that person. Jacob Finch Bonner is a mediocre writer who had some moderate success with his first book. His second sank into obscurity with barely a ripple and he now finds himself teaching creative writing to a new generation of hopefuls. One of his students, Evan Parker, an obnoxious young man is unwilling to share much of his writing but claims to have an idea for a sure fire plot that cannot fail. Begrudgingly Jake agrees with him when he finally wheedles the plot out of Evan.Jake think nothing more of this but, a couple of years later, is surprised not to find Evan‚Äôs book on the bestseller lists. He does some basic sleuthing and learns that Evan died shortly after attending his (Jake‚Äôs) course. He also learns that there are, apparently, no living relatives. So Jake does the unthinkable and takes Evan‚Äôs plot and crafts it into a book that, yes, makes it onto the bestseller lists. Ok it‚Äôs not his plot but all the words are his. He did write the story. He is still riding the wave of success when he gets the first message from someone calling themselves TalentedTom claiming he is a thief! Jake brushes it off. How can you steal an idea? Aren‚Äôt most plots derivative of something? Didn‚Äôt he write all of the words in the actual book? But as the messages continue and get more threatening he decides to try and track down this TalentedTom and set them to rights. He travels around following the leads and clues. What he finds though is rather disturbing. It‚Äôs not just a plot he has taken - it seems to be someone‚Äôs actual life story. And that someone is not very happy about it!I do agree the story was very well written although in a very flippant style. That‚Äôs fine, I do flippancy myself. It was, however, I thought, quite slow and not particularly riveting. Yes it got a lot more interesting towards the end but by then I had already guessed the twist so again any suspense was lost on me. The way the story was told - a book within a book was well done and Jake‚Äôs character was really well portrayed. He wasn‚Äôt exactly likeable but neither was he unlikeable, I suppose he was like most of us, a mixture of characteristics and just trying to make a living. I could totally imagine him sitting at his keyboard typing away at this amazing story. But that‚Äôs my other problem - I don‚Äôt actually agree that ‚Äòthe plot‚Äô was that exceptional! The idea for the book was very good and I know a lot of people enjoyed it more than I did. I didn‚Äôt NOT enjoy it - I just didn‚Äôt love it but I think the author has a lot of talent and I would totally read another book by her.

82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6970586-denise,Rating 4 out of 5,"I almost gave up after the first 50 or so pages - I thought the start of this one was beyond slow, but luckily I had read several reviews warning of the slow start so I knew to keep on, and ultimately I'm glad I did. I'm not sure that this is quite the mind-shattering, jaw-dropping read that is being touted, but it is a clever, twisty, tale of comeuppance that I found very unique and for that alone, it is worth 4 stars. Jacob Finch Bonner, a down-and-out novelist, is teaching in a third-rate MFA program and hasn‚Äôt written anything decent in years. When an arrogant student, Evan Parker/Parker Evan, announces he doesn‚Äôt need Jake‚Äôs help because the plot of his book in progress is a sure thing, Jake is skeptical ... until he hears the plot, and he knows it will be an instant hit. He waits for the publication of Parker‚Äôs book, but it never comes. After doing some digging, he discovers that his former student died, presumably without ever completing his book, Jake does what any self-respecting writer would do with a plot like that‚Äîhe publishes it. In a few short years, Jake has it all - he is wealthy, famous, praised and read all over the world, thanks to Parker's plot idea. But at the height of his fame, an e-mail arrives that says only, ""You are a thief."" And thus begins the downward spiral of Jake Bonner.This is one that you are best going into rather blind, so I am not going to say too much about the storyline. I'll be honest, I didn't like Jake's character at all - he is pretentious, cold, and rather calculating - but I think that is how Korelitz intended for the reader to feel about him. I can't say as any character really gripped me, but it didn't bother me in the least, as that fits the plot. I loved the glimpse into the writing and academia world that Korelitz offered, and I really liked the chapters that gave snippets into the book Jake stole from Parker. My only real disappointment was that I figured out most of the plot pretty early on ‚Äì one or two things did somewhat surprise me, but I was right about most of it. Still though, it was a crazy ride getting to the very cleverly-done ending. As an aside ‚Äì I always find it interesting when authors reference Goodreads in their plots (talking about poor reviews and checking on how many stars their book has, etc.). I thought Korelitz may have been being a bit patronizing, but overall, it gave me a good laugh! This really is different from your average thriller, and for that I applaud Korelitz.

The novelist steals an over-the-top story idea from one of his fourth-rate students. The stolen story gets published and the novelist's fame and wealth soar. The novelist's ""perfect world"" starts to fall apart, however, when he receives an anonymous ""I know what you did"" email accusing him of stealing the story.It's important to note the novelist wrote his best-selling ""stolen story"" book in its entirety by himself. I have read many books with very, very, very similar plots and even though I agree that stealing an author's idea for a book does not comply with ""best practices"" and is WRONG, it happens all of the time.I listened to the audiobook and perhaps the reason why I was unable to connect with the book's protagonist (and had trouble staying awake when listening!) can be blamed on the book's bland narration by narrator Kirby Heyborne. The book only had one narrator and almost 11 hours of straight book narration did not bode well for this narrator or this listener. I was waiting for a jolt from both the author and/or the narrator, and was left disappointed. (I was actually hoping for several jolts!) I checked Kirby Heyborne's credits and he did a great job with the narration of ""GONE GIRL"" and 'THE WIFE UPSTAIRS"" but in those books, he only narrated portions of those audiobooks and not the entire audio.Author Jean Hanff Korelitz has had great luck with film and television adaptations of her novels and if the author secures a screen deal for THE PLOT, I will definitely be watching!Special thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with an ARC in exchange for an honest review of the book."

I can‚Äôt say enough wonderful things about this book!As anyone who is deeply invested in the literary world knows, even the mention of scandal surrounding the plot of a book or what inspired it can cause an uproar that can make it hard for a book to recover from. I don‚Äôt want to rehash something that got way too much attention in the media as is, but I can remember just such a scenario happening last year. Two books came out close in time that were on a somewhat obscure historical period and profession, rendering a discussion in the book world that spiraled quickly out of hand over whether one author had essentially taken the other author‚Äôs idea and run with it.Jean Hanff Korelitz‚Äôs novel The Plot is based around a premise that, while different, reminded me of this exact discussion. Because truly, even if someone did hear about something from someone else, who is the owner of an idea?Jacob Finch Bonner is such an interesting character‚Äîneither fully rootable nor fully despisable. This is the hardest sort of character balance to strike, I think, and shows the skill of the author in crafting him.

By the time our story begins, Jacob is teaching writing at a third-rate MFA program, at a school that (unlike his own) has neither the reputation nor quality to matter much to most of the staff and students.In the slog of yet another cohort beginning, Jacob meets a rather obnoxious student who declines to share his writing with his class, claiming he has a plot for a book in his head that is so outstanding, it doesn‚Äôt matter if he is a good writer. The book will be a bestseller regardless. Jacob dismisses this bravado until he meets with the student to review his chapter, and the student tells him the plot. And suddenly Jacob realizes he is right. This is the sort of plot that will make this one of the most popular books of its time. The sort of plot that will have movies made off of it, that will have people talking, that will be the pick of every famous book club out there.And how demoralizing to know that it is the idea of someone so distasteful!Several years go by, the program shuts down and Jacob is laid off. He‚Äôs taken a job at a retreat to make ends meet while he tries yet another attempt at his third book. He has almost forgotten about his former student, until by chance he learns that his student passed away not long after the program, without ever having written his book.And suddenly Jacob finds himself in an interesting position.

And the book was long (400+ pages) ‚Äî which normally wouldn‚Äôt matter, except that the story was written in such a convoluted way that, by the time I got to the end, I was just glad it was over.Given the above experience, it shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise that I went into Korelitz‚Äôs newest book 
The Plot
 with a bit of trepidation, despite the fact that, as soon as I had read the book‚Äôs premise, I had immediately wanted to read it. My concerns didn‚Äôt go away even after starting the book, as the story progressed really slowly for the first 50 pages or so ‚Äî not only that, I also started noticing some of the long, meandering, overly-descriptive passages that had irked me in her previous book. But I stuck with it and am so glad I did, as this ended up being such a wonderful read! The story centers around a writer named Jacob Finch Bonner, a once successful author of a bestseller who hit a snag with his second book and is now struggling to move his career forward. While teaching at a low residency MFA program, Jake encounters a student, Evan Parker, who shares with him the plot of a story he plans on writing that he believes will be ‚Äúa sure thing.‚Äù Several years later, as Jake still struggles with his writing and has just about given up all hopes of reviving his career, he inadvertently finds out that Evan Parker has died, supposedly without having finished the ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù novel he had bragged about during the MFA session. At this point, Jake does what he feels any self-respecting writer would do ‚Äî he takes the plot that Evan had told him about and turns it into a widely-read, bestselling novel. Jake instantly becomes famous and also wealthy beyond measure. One day, as he is riding the highs of success in both his personal and professional lives, he receives a mysterious message that contains four terrifying words: ‚ÄúYou are a thief.‚Äù But it doesn‚Äôt stop there ‚Äî as Jake receives more and more threatening messages, to the point that he can‚Äôt ignore them anymore, he sets off on a race against time to find out who his harasser is in the hopes of confronting them before they expose him.As I mentioned earlier, I initially didn‚Äôt have very high expectations going into this book (despite all the hype it has gotten so far) because I thought it would be a convoluted, drawn-out story that would take me longer than preferred to read. But this book turned out to be opposite of what I was expecting ‚Äî not only was it a quick read for me (I finished it in 2 sittings, with majority of the book completed in the second sitting because I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to put it down), the story was also tightly-plotted and absolutely brilliantly written. Of course, there were still moments throughout the story where certain passages veered into the ‚Äúoverly-descriptive‚Äù category, but not to the extent as her previous book, in my opinion. Having said this, in researching the author and her other works, I‚Äôve come to realize that this is actually her distinctive writing style, which is good to know. In addition to a cleverly-crafted story however, one of the things that makes this book stand out is the way the characters are rendered, especially the main character Jake. As a character, Jake is entirely fictional, however the way his struggles as a writer and the angst he goes through both come across so realistically, it really made the character come alive for me ‚Äî to the point that I found it difficult to figure out where I stood in terms of what he did. Here, Korelitz did a masterful job weaving in recent ‚Äúdiscussions‚Äù about certain aspects of the publishing industry and literary community that have been concerns over the years: issues such as appropriation versus inspiration, who should get to tell what story, the writing process and the trials and tribulations of being a writer, and most interesting of all, an inside glimpse into the publishing world and the role of the writer in that world. Another unique aspect of this book is the way Korelitz utilizes the ‚Äústory within a story‚Äù method to tell Jake‚Äôs story by incorporating excerpts from his book (the one with the ‚Äústolen‚Äù plot) interspersed throughout the story, culminating in a fantastic coming together of the plot to create a ‚Äúfiction vs reality‚Äù twist in the end. I don‚Äôt want to say too much so as not to give away the ending, but I will say that this was one of the most propulsive, surprising endings that I‚Äôve read in awhile.Lastly, I just wanted to comment on why I ended up rating this one 4.5 stars rather than the full 5 stars. The main reason for this is because I actually was able to figure out aspects of the ending early on, which made the ‚Äúbig reveal‚Äù (specifically as it pertained to the person sending the messages to Jake) less impactful ‚Äî though with that said, the last couple scenes were definitely unexpected and very well-done.This literary thriller is definitely a ‚Äúmust-read‚Äù in my book! It‚Äôs clever and creative and even though I did figure out parts of it early on, I still found much of the plot to be unpredictable in terms of the direction things ended up going. Already, this book is getting a lot of buzz, and deservedly so, in my opinion! And I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this one also gets optioned for a movie or TV series at some point ‚Äî I would definitely be interested in watching if that were to be the case!Received ARC from Celadon Books via NetGalley"
93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74034800-lucy,Rating 3 out of 5,"This blurb had everything I wanted in a thriller- I don‚Äôt know what it is but I love the academic or literary setting and a thriller. So to discover a novel about a down-on-his-luck, once-successful author stealing another‚Äôs plot and the consequences that come with this, had me requesting this book immediately. Jacob ‚ÄúFinch‚Äù Bonner, a once successful author, is now working at a literary programme on a small college campus. Here he has to read other student-writer hopefuls work (which he hates doing) and giving them tips. When a student arrives called Evan Parker, a self-confident, sort-of-an-asshole, tells Jake about his plot, Jake (and Evan already) knows that this is unique and will become an instant best-seller and success.Switching to a few years later Jake is still in a rut with his writing and life when he remembers this student- what ever happened to him? What happened to his novel? And from there he steals the plot and publishes his own.Bathing in his success, Jake starts getting anonymous emails- someone who knows his secret- and from this point, Jakes mental anguish and trying to discover who this person is consumes his life.It was fascinating to see the investigation Jake does to find the truth of who is threatening him and finding more about his ex-student. As things unravel, Jake learns where the plot originally came from and this investigation I really enjoyed. The author here does well to plot the narcissism of Jake to begin with and the self-frustration at not being able to write a new book and lack of ideas. I would say that this was a slow burning novel (which isn‚Äôt for me) but the novel does pick up around 60% when move things are uncovered and then I wanted to read more.I did unfortunately guess the ending quite early on in the book so there was no sudden ‚Äútwist‚Äù that I usually love from thrillers. Also the beginning of this book seemed to have lots of exclamation marks for some reason. They were used at points that I didn‚Äôt think were necessary- but I think that‚Äôs just me üòÇüôà I am not a writer but the over-use of exclamation marks at the beginning did keep throwing me off.

97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40997852-nicole,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsFirst, for such a book that heavily involved publishing houses, I have no idea how such a dreadful cover was chosen. I spent months thinking that's the cover of the arc and not the book itself. The designer could've done a much better job especially since it's a book about a book! A lot of room for creativity but no, let's go with the most direct and ugly way.Next. I honestly liked this book much better than I expected. It was more fun and interesting than I originally thought and that ending was strong!! I have the mental capacity of a goldfish when listening to mystery audiobooks so I don't bother to guess the final twist and it did not even occur to me, not even remotely, how the author will close his story.I also assumed when I read the description that I would hate Jake, he sounds obnoxious. I didn't. Far from it. I was able to understand his PoV and see why he acted the way he did. It's very human. Sure, at the beginning, I didn't appreciate his character at all given the way he treats his teaching job. I wouldn't go as far as saying he's a bad person but the beauty of books is that we can appreaciate those and it's always a plus when their PoV makes sense, not complete BS.The only thing that prevented me from rating this book higher was that the story was slow and it lost me several times before Jake took off on his own personal ""quest"". I wouldn't go as far as saying it's a thriller because a huge part of it is purely fiction, discussing the characters' inner thoughts, his turmoil, his response to his problems... I did get me bored a bit but overall, it is a good book. Would I recommend it? Well, check GR's summary and if it sounds like something you'd like then sure give it a shot. It's different from the usual mysteries given the time the author delves into the author's inner thoughts and at many points it was mostly character driven rather than plot drive until that explosive ending. The audiobook was also well narrated and I rarely lost focus while listening. Even if I did, I was still able to keep track of the story. "
98,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53067896-amina,Rating 2 out of 5,"I had a hard time getting into this book from beginning to end. Initially, I thought the book had a good idea but about 30 percent of the way in, I started to lose interest. Maybe that's the time it picked up for many, but I couldn't commit to the plot with ""The Plot"". Jacob Finch Bonner started off as a pretty great first time author, but he hasn't been able to write a second novel, and can't even think of a slightly interesting plot. To keep himself relevant, Bonner is teaching an MFA course. One of his students, Evan Parker, who is obscenely arrogant feels like he doesn't need Bonner's help and has an amazing plot. When Parker suddenly dies, Bonner takes on his plot and enjoys all the notoriety that comes with it. What happens next consumes Bonner. Someone is on to his stolen novel and want to expose Bonner for stealing Parker's story. I had a hard time dealing with the main character's whinny, annoying, and tiresome failed attempt at becoming someone important again. What ensues after felt too predictable and simplified. This was a laborious read for my semi-important desire for good mystery. I know many others enjoyed it, and I just couldn't commit. I gave it a solid 2.5 stars. "
99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75801211-max,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love the ""obsessed artist"" archetype, and in The Plot's context: the obsessed author. Jake, his anonymous hunter, and even Evan Parker are all very compelling and complex characters. The writing of the Plot felt very literary when compared to other popular thrillers being released this year. Jake's narrative of his life before ""fame"" is slow-paced but a great introduction to set the building blocks of an amazing twist. And yes, like the many others in the reviews section, I will also continue to gush over the hugely anticipated twist at the end of the novel. You also get a book inside a book format, sort of similar to Moonflower Murders. The Plot is truly just a bunch of pretty crazy ideas all mashed into one, and it works for me! Korelitz, being an author herself, kept the commentary interesting about some of the highs and lows of being a writer. This is a great book to pull an all-nighter for, the ending was worth the read!

It was boring, drab, stupid, dumb, wordy, pointless, trying too much and ending up achieving nothing, the main character was a clueless moron, so much so that he couldn't find his own arse with a map and a head start, the ""twist"" was predictable and could be figured out after a few pages, really,there was no suspense as the plot is not only lazy but extremely straight forward and relies on the stupidity of its main character... And my word: THAT FUCKING BULLSHIT ENDING! Seriously?! I'd be glad if there was a way to erase this novel from my mind or get back the hours I wasted on this piece of crap.Can't, and won't recommend this to anyone. "

Jacob Finch Bonner was an author with a great first book, but then his subsequent books didn't do well. He's struggling to write anything good! He is now teaching an MFA writing program. He then meets one of his students Evan Parker, who is bragging about a plot that he has written for a book saying this it's going to be a bestseller, and could even be picked up to be made into a movie.When Jake reads the PLOT, he does agree with how great it is. Well years later Jake thinks about Evan and how he has never heard anything about him or his book. He does some digging and finds out that Evan died a few years ago. So then he has the idea that HE could write the book. So he uses Evans PLOT and becomes a successful author again, and things are looking good in his life. Then one day he gets a message on his site threatening him, and saying he stole ""THE PLOT"". Who else could possibly know the truth? I don't want to say anything more and ruin it for you, but I loved the mystery behind this one. The book picks up pace the more you get into it, and I really loved the twisted ending.

103,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37640114-emma-scott,Rating 3 out of 5,"The premise of this book is that our hero, Jake, (I picture him as the actor who plays Nate on Succession) is a failed novelist who once had promise. He now teaches at a small writer's program and one of his unruly students tells him the plot of the book he plans to write. Jake is struck with envy and a certainty that this plot is SOOO GOOOD that it'll make literary tsunamis once released. But years later, no book. Evan has passed away. Out of a sense of writerly duty to a good idea, he can't let the story languish, so he writes the book Evan never did. As predicted, it becomes a huge, mega-selling, blockbuster, Oprah Book Club, Spielberg attached to direct, NYT bestselling novel. After it blows up, Jake begins receiving threatening anonymous messages to the tune of ""You're a thief"" and ""I know what you did."" Our novel then becomes a mystery to find out who else knew Evan's story and is tormenting Jake about it. Sounds pretty exciting, which is why I picked it up in the first place. Plus, books about books, writers, and author-y stuff are my jam. I loved the inclusion of insider tidbits, writer angst, and name-drops of some of my faves, like Donna Tartt and Stephen King. I was ready for a five star read. But the thing is, Jake is not a plagiarist. He didn't steal a word of Evan‚Äôs writing. He used an unused idea. An idea that wasn't going anywhere or being written by anyone else. This is not thievery. He is not a criminal. If I post online a plot idea for a book and then fail to write the book, someone else just might. And so long as they use none of my actual words, they'd have every right to. You can't copyright ideas. But the threats grow stronger and Jake's publishers make legal noises against the culprit while Jake's freaking out about discovery (as he has been this entire time.) And that's the narrative tension that drives the first 2/3 of the book. I almost fell for it, too. Jake's paranoid about social media outing him, but here's thing: he didn't do anything wrong. If there's one thing we know about Twitter it's that it demands receipts. Without actual screenshots of plagiarism, these accusations are baseless noise. Jake makes a few comments about the duty of a writer to salvage a good story, and that's valid but also completely deflates the entire conflict. The original author is dead and has been dead for years (not a spoiler, that's in the blurb). So there isn't going to be any book. So there's nothing to ""steal"" here. As a reader, that detracted from the enjoyment. As a writer, the bigger issue was that the plot to the mega bestseller in question here is not only excerpted throughout the book, it's also called every manner of superlatives imaginable. At one point, this plot is even deemed ""legendary.""For the author to hype it with that kind of language, the plot twist has to be absolutely mind-blowing. Keanu-Reeves-like-whoa. I guessed it pretty easily and while it's a cool idea, it's just that: a pretty cool idea. And that's okay. It can be a cool idea. And while it‚Äôs all good to have confidence in one's work--god knows writers need all the mental boost they can get‚Äîconfidence in the work isn't the same as telling your readers that your plot twist is literally the stuff of legend. I don't like giving negative reviews but my biggest pet peeve in any book I read (or write) is when stuff just plain doesn't make sense. I don't try to pull crap on my readers and I don't like it being pulled on me. As if I will just accept what is tossed my way without much thought. I give much thought. ;) So three stars for an unconventional ending and the writerly goodness at the beginning. I don't deter anyone else from reading it either--many, many others have enjoyed it, and maybe I'm just too darn picky for my own good. I can't just go with the flow. I wish I could; this one might've been a lot more fun."

It felt like it took a really long time for Jake to decide to write the book. Then, once he did, the book spent way, way too long with him feeling guilty about writing it. Finally, it starts to pick up about the halfway point. The second half is pretty good, but then the ending pretty much ruined it for me. In another review, I complained about twists coming out of nowhere without any kind of build up or hinting. This book falls at the other end of the spectrum where it gave out too many hints. I knew what every twist was going to be long before it was actually revealed. The only real surprise was the very ending. The author had two ways to end it, and in my opinion, they picked the worst option. Surprise!Probably my biggest complaint, other than the ending, was some of Jake's decision making. He spends way too much time lying when there really wasn't any need to. His argument for why he ""stole"" the book were enough to convince me that it was okay. Like the book said repeatedly, plots and basic outlines get used over and over, so I didn't see any real issue with it. Evan wasn't alive to write the book anymore. Jake wrote the entire book on his own and just borrowed the plot, so there was no plaigarism. As far as I'm concerned, it passes the sniff test. He could have also done a better job planning. At some point in the second half of the book, he should have realized what he was dealing with and begun to take some precautions. Ulitmately, I think I'd have rather read the novel within the novel, than The Plot. It felt like a more interesting story than the one we ultimately got. I was disappointed that we only got one or two pages at a time. At the least, I'd have liked to see alternating chapters between the Plot and Crib.

With a little more than half to go, I literally could not flip the pages fast enough and stayed up way past my bedtime to finish!Jake is a struggling author trying to reclaim the small amount of fame he felt from his first book. Problem is, he can't seem to write anything and his lackluster ideas take years to get down on paper and fizzle out before they even start. Teaching a three-week, immersive creative writing course for Ripley College, Jake feels burnt out and underwhelmed with his life.When he meets student Evan Parker, Jake is less than impressed with Parker's arrogance and overconfidence. Parker claims he has the next big American novel on his hands and isn't shy about letting people know. However, he keeps the plot close to his chest. In a constructive session, Jake is able to get Parker to open up a bit about the plot and he's dismayed when he actually agrees that there's no way the book won't be a hit.Years later, stuck in another dead end job and working on a novel going nowhere, Jake thinks back to his old student Evan Parker, wondering why he never saw the great American novel hit shelves. Turns out, Evan Parker died shortly after the creative writing class. Is it really stealing if Jake writes the whole book on his own and just uses the basic plot line designed by Parker? Can Jake live with himself if he does?This was such an interesting novel about morality and right versus wrong, how to live with guilt, and the impact of our decisions on ourselves and others. Additionally, it discussed some very relevant topics such as cultural appropriation and the impact of social media, bloggers and early reviewers on authors and literature. Being an early reviewer, blogger, and Goodreads user, I loved the references to those platforms and the viewpoints from the publishers and authors. I couldn't give this one the full five stars because admittedly I found the first chapter to be a slog (it was all dramatically uphill from there) and I figured out the basic twist less than halfway through (this did not in any way slow my reading down and actually probably sped it up because I HAD to know if I was right!). I really loved the format of this book with the novel within a novel. I was totally enthralled with Crib and loved the snippets we got.

111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,Rating 4 out of 5,"It's bestseller-like with a whiff of the artsy thanks to the subject matter -- namely writing and writers and the games they play. Clearly the author, Korelitz, knows the terrain well. You see lines like so:""I've learned so much about writers. You're a strange kind of beast, aren't you, with your petty feuds and your fifty shades of narcissism? You act like words don't belong to everyone.""And this:""... the world -- the world of writers in particular -- was full of bitter people who believed they were owed something or other, by someone or other. The logic of this being something like:""If you could write a sentence you deserved to consider yourself a writer.""If you had an 'idea' for a 'novel' you deserved to consider yourself a novelist.""If you actually completed a manuscript you deserved to have someone publish it.""If someone published it you deserved to be sent on a twenty-city book tour and have your book featured full-page ads in The New York Times Book Review.""And, if, at any point on this ladder of entitlement, one of the aforementioned things you deserved failed to materialize, the blame for that must rest at whatever point you'd been unfairly obstructed:""Your daily life -- for not giving you an opportunity to write.""The 'professional' or already 'established' writers -- who'd gotten there quicker because of unspecified advantages.""The agents and publishers -- who could only protect and burnish the reputations of their existing authors by keeping new authors out.""The entire book industrial complex -- which (following some equal algorithm of profit) doubled down on a few name-brand authors and effectively silenced everyone else.""In the Acknowledgments at the end, Korelitz apologizes for being so rough on writers, but says it's only because she loves her brethren so much. (Editor's Comment: ""Tough love,"" anyone?)As for the book, it doesn't feature a cover blurb by Uber-reader Stephen King for nothing! This novel could have been written by King. In fact, he no doubt wishes he had written the thing. But, because he didn't, he generously and correctly assured us that it is ""insanely readable,"" which is a great way of saying, ""Plot, baby. Great plot.""Good characterization, too. Reads like a mystery, too. A plagiarism case in need of a whodunnit in need of a warning about SPOILERS. O. Henry would sympathize. By the end, you may too. Me, I insanely turned pages. I followed the long and winding road to (pardon my French) denouement. I wondered a bit if the long step-by-step solution was one too many steps.Maybe. Or maybe me being impatient, which I seldom am with a book. On a bestseller rating, I give this a 5. On an ""all the world's a stage (of every book written in 2021), I give it a 4. If you feel like some fun or like mysteries or, like me, have had a taste (however small) of writing and publishers and fellow writers and egos and much ado about that something we call nothing -- even in that Outback we call ""Poetry World"" -- you'll relish this book. Pass the hot dog."
112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126296-kristy,Rating 4 out of 5,"A suspenseful read about the ownership of storiesJacob Finch Bonner, the once promising author of the debut novel The Invention of Wonder, is now a struggling writer teaching at Ripley College in Vermont. At Ripley, basically anyone can attend to receive a MFA. This includes Evan Parker, a pompous jerk who declares he doesn't need Jake--or anyone's--help to make his novel a success. But when Evan actually deigns to share his plot with Jake, Jake can't help but agree. He waits for Evan's inevitable success, but it never comes. When he learns that Evan has died--without having published his book--Jake feels that his story must be told. So Jake writes it, and he is soon basking in the success he was so sure Evan would have. He's rich, famous, and touring the country on a book tour. But then he receives the first email: ""You are a thief."" Jake feels everything he has about to slip away. As the threats increase, Jake begins to dig into Evan's past. What he finds is horrifying--he may not be the only one who stole this story--and the consequences could be deadly. 
""All Jacob Finch Bonnner had ever wanted to be was a writer."" 
THE PLOT starts off slowly, but then takes off, becoming a compulsively readable thriller. It's incredibly ominous and creepy and peppered with reading and writer references. If you love to read, or write, there's a whole meta layer to this book. (Not to mention, we get pieces of Jake's ""stolen"" novel within our novel as well.) Slowly everything untangles: Jacob's plot, Evan's life, and more. 
""Evan Parker had been entirely correct: the worst writer on the planet could not mess up a plot like this."" 
The book builds on, year by year, as Jacob moves from his struggling writer days to a successful and famous novelist. I had an inkling of some of what happened, but enjoyed reading to see if I was right. Jake isn't exactly a sympathetic character, but he's fascinating, and the book certainly makes you think. It's best to go into THE PLOT blind, so I don't want to reveal too much. But I stayed up late to finish it, because it's quite captivating--and different. I certainly recommend it. 4 stars.

As both novelist and writing program instructor, the reader is given a clue about the direction when Jake Bonner, the protagonist, cites a book quote early in the story. From there, the plot reveals elements that if paid attention to, signal the finale. While I'm no Sherlock Holmes, I had it figured out when a 'chance' encounter on a book tour blossoms. It's well written, paced and engaging, though I felt Jake's character was shallow. Regardless, its easy to see how its popularity grew, though its far from what I'd call unique. A fan of unusual characters, unique plots and evocative writing, this one fails in all three. That said, if mystery is your preferred genre, you'll probably enjoy it. "

119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4708498-sketchbook,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is the best psychological thriller I've read in years - and the most disturbing. There are a ton of lauded reviews here, so I'll be brief. After a creative writing teacher helps himself to the plot of a dead student's story and it becomes a huge best-seller, the teacher starts receiving emails, ""You are a thief,"" and other tormenting messages. Alas, the teacher knew nothing about the student or his personal life. Author Korelitz interweaves pages from the best-seller and, yes, it's a gripping (shocking) story. Some GRs say ""The Plot"" starts slowly: nonsense! These infantiles want a dead body by Chapter 2 !This is a novel about writers, writing, the whole creative process and the morality of using someone else's ideas. ""We're not all hung up about the sales and the rankings and the Amazon number,"" the teacher-writer Jake tells his soon to be wife. ""But we're just so glad that people are reading our work."" He reminds himself: On creating narrative tension...""Understanding what made a story track and grab and hold....can just anyone do that?""""In my world,"" the tormented Jake explains, ""the migration of a story is something we recognize, and respect. Works of art can overlap. Narratives get told and retold. It's how stories survive through the ages."" Yes, he feels, this is powerful, exciting, and - hell - it has a kind of beauty.Here's a fiercely intelligent ""thriller"" from an original mind. About 2/3rds of the way author Korelitz deliberately suggests who the email blackmailer is, and you, dear reader, can participate in the chilling plot within ""The Plot."""

It is worth mentioning this is definitely more of a slow-burn mystery with a literary bent, than a twist-galore commercial thriller; but the deliberate pacing is justified for the well-realized cast of characters, and the planted hints throughout that actually lead towards its grim reveal (rather than the blindsided, but illogical 'twist for the sake of it' maneuver that often disrupt stories of this genre). Also, how subtly clever is the book title and cover design (hardcover edition)? I 'get' it now.Overall, The Plot feels extremely classy and substantial; not only does it dive deep into the process and psyche of authorship (inspiration vs. plagiarism), but also sustain a constant echoing of fiction vs. reality (love the meta detail, such as the fictional 'novel' in the story being published by the actual publisher in real life).This might be an odd comparison, but the taut atmosphere of The Game with Michael Douglas came to mind numerous times‚ÄîI would love to see David Fincher adapting this!***This ARC was provided by the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

Soon, he‚Äôs teaching creative writing at a third-rate college, helping aspiring writers, including Evan Parker. Jake takes an immediate dislike to Evan, who claims he has the next ‚Äúhit‚Äù novel, and insists he does not need Jake‚Äôs help or guidance in order to be a huge success. What‚Äôs worse is that when Jake reads Evan‚Äôs work he realizes that Evan may actually be right. Months later, Jacob is working an ‚Äúartists retreat‚Äù, dealing almost exclusively with struggling writers, when he finds out that his former student Evan passed away, leaving his book idea unpublished. Jacob decides to take the idea and write a book of his own and it instantly hits superstar status, until he starts to receive messages calling him a ‚Äúthief‚Äù, that threaten his entire future. Jean Hanff Korelitz newest novel, ‚ÄúThe Plot‚Äù takes a deep look into the world of creative writing, book publishing, and the general birth of a novel from the mind of writer and beyond. Although Korelitz is a well-known and much-published author, I have not read her before and figured a book about books and the writing process was a good place to start  (also, anything Stephen King calls ‚Äúcompulsively readable‚Äù is on my immediate TBR list). ‚ÄúThe Plot‚Äù is creative and well-written, with substantial vocabulary. This novel has all the nitty gritty details of the publishing world, from the consumerism to the backhanded support and competition between authors. It was an engaging look at the ‚Äúbackstage‚Äù world of books and their creation, and I was intrigued from page one. Each chapter is relatively short, which contributes to its ‚Äúcompulsive readability‚Äù and is told from Jacob‚Äôs viewpoint, allowing a reader to bond with Jacob as he struggles with his moral and creative challenges. One can‚Äôt read this book and not wonder what they would do in this instance, and begin their own internal debate as to whether Jacob‚Äôs choice was moral or not. Above all, it is the ending of this novel that blew me away. As soon as I got to it, I let out an audible gasp. It was completely unexpected while still managing to be realistic and believable‚ÄîI definitely didn‚Äôt see it coming! I picked up this novel completely based on reading nothing but positive reviews, opinions and accolades and I can see they were well deserved- Hanff Korelitz has a winner on her hands!"

Yes, this author comes out with TWO novels in one and both are sure to be hits! This thriller starts out slow, but by the time you get comfortable, she shakes you up like ants in an ant farm - yes, my reading friends- there are ant bodies flying everywhere while you try to ferret out who is doing what and will this fictional author (because our real one absolutely got away with it) get away with stealing (borrowing/ resurrecting‚Ä¶) someone else‚Äôs plot.

Even though I predicted the culprit (I'm notoriously bad at this too), the ending was deviously satisfying.- No pun intended, but the plot is truly genius. It's also a wonderful insight into the psyche of a writer. The ups and downs, the expectations, etc. Reasons for my reservations to round up:- The execution and the artistic decision-making. With a plot like this, you can go a number of different ways. I would've enjoyed seeing this play out without ever knowing a single thing about the plot of Jacob's book. HOWEVER, this path wouldn't have led us to the ending I enjoyed so much. So there's that.- The plot and the ""twist"" of Jacob's book was underwhelming. It's the risk the author took touting a sure thing, best seller.Ultimately, the good far outweighs my minor gripes. But if anybody wants to turn this into a Burn After Reading type of comedy, I will forever be your fan. Cheers!"

128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15962370-sarah,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Plot is an entertaining psychological thriller exploring the competitive world of aspiring authors and the publishing industry.The first part of the book is set on a Vermont college campus, as published author Jacob Finch Bonner teaches a short course for aspiring writers. It's not a job he's passionate about - having experienced fleeting success and recognition after the publication of his first book several years ago, he's struggled to live up to his early promise and has to take on teaching jobs to support himself financially. Among the predictably uninspiring cohort of wannabe writers Jacob is assigned is one standout, a rather obnoxious young man called Evan Parker. Evan confidently asserts that his has a unique plot idea that cannot fail but launch him into the publishing stratosphere - but he won't share it with the group. Over the course of their private meetings, Jacob gains access to the opening pages of Evan's manuscript and gradually draws out of him the great plot twist, and he's stunned: Evan is right - his plot is a virtually guaranteed bestseller.Returning to his dispirited life, searching but failing to find inspiration for another novel, Jacob waits for Evan's novel to hit the shelves, but it never does. It transpires that the young author died tragically shortly after the conclusion of the writing course, and never got a chance to finish his book. Readers will guess what happens next - Jacob develops the plot idea himself, quickly finds a publisher and the book becomes a runaway bestseller.All is rosy for Jacob for a while - he has the life he's always aspired to - but then the creepy emails start arriving: ""You are a thief."".Jacob becomes quite paranoid, terrified that he'll be publicly exposed - but for what? It's not as if he plagiarised Evan's work, and there's no property in ideas, is there? As Jacob digs deeper into the story of Evan's life and death, he comes to the shocking realisation that Evan's imaginative plot premise may actually be based on real life events. And someone out there is furious that Jacob has appropriated their personal tragedy for his own gain - can Jacob hunt down the truth and identify his online stalker before his career is blown out of the water, or worse?The Plot takes a meta-fiction format, with excerpts from both Evan's manuscript and Jacob's published novel woven into the main narrative. Jean Hanff Korelitz cleverly drip-feeds details to readers as the story unfolds. While the plot twist alluded to throughout is surprising and unusual, I didn't find it quite as earth-shatteringly original as it had been portrayed. Perhaps this is the author playing games with her audience - there are so many layers of reality and perspective here, it's hard to be sure.As a qualified lawyer and aspiring fiction writer myself, what I enjoyed the most about The Plot was the exploration of intellectual property concepts against a narrative background. Where is the line between taking artistic inspiration, which all authors do, and plagiarism / stealing? Who owns a true story, and to what extent can it be legitimately incorporated into a work of fiction? Is it okay for an author to enjoy professional acclaim and huge profits off the back of someone else's trauma? I had sympathy with both ""sides"" of these conundra, as played out by the story and characters of The Plot. While Jacob wasn't a particularly likeable character in many respects, my own feeling was that he had the letter of the law on his side, if perhaps not the spirit. Jacob's battle of conscience over Evan and constant self-justification reinforced this impression.The Plot is a thought-provoking and entertaining read, which I'd recommend highly to any reader who enjoys twisty thrillers, especially those with a literary setting.My thanks to the author, Jean Hanff Korelitz, publisher Faber & Faber Ltd., NetGalley and NetGalleyUK, for the opportunity to read and review this intriguing title."

Dismayed at this predicament and with his inadequacies, Jacob desperately looks for that ‚Äúbig break‚Äù that will propel him back into the limelight of the literary world.Enter Evan Parker. Evan is a blistering, arrogant snob that claims he has a blockbuster of a novel. That his novel will be an instant bestseller. Not easily persuaded, Jacob regards Evan‚Äôs boastful remarks as showboating until he hears the plot. It is then that Jacob waits with bated breath for news of Evan‚Äôs book release. Nothing happens. Then, Jacob learns of Evan‚Äôs untimely death. Of course, knowing that the plot would be a bestseller and that the story needs to be told, Evan does what any other author of his time would do. That is to write a novel worthy of A-list producers and directors.The Plot is a slow and deliberate read. The reader needs to be prepared to ride the tide and be well invested in order to fully appreciate and enjoy the novel. It took me past the 50% point before I actually thought, ‚Äúwow, this is an interesting novel.‚ÄùThe characters are somewhat boring in an of themselves, but the plot is what makes them shine together.

You know the movies your 13 year old likes, about babysitters who hear a noise in the basement and though they are frightened they decide to investigate? Those movies that give the kids a chance to shout in unison ""Don't do it!""?Because there is nothing else at all to move the plot along if someone isn't doing stupid things against even their own better judgement?That's this book. The main character is a self-centred, navel-gazing dweeb, who constantly does things he knows he shouldn't, then moans about the consequences. I shouldn't even call him the main character because he has no character. The protagonist then.He consistently trashes other people - everybody really - his students, other writers, and envy rules his life and his world since he sees himself as having been denied the success that should rightfully be his.It's nasty, and he gets really boring.But that said, the twists at the end are really very good.

132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5990485-mary,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Plot by Jean Hanff Korelitz is a slow burn mystery/thriller that centers around a struggling writer named Jacob Finch Bonner who ends up stealing the plot of another writer's book. This one definitely took me a decent amount of time to get into, but after I did I found it to be quite enjoyable. I thought of it more as a mystery than as a thriller and had no idea who the mysterious person calling Bonner a thief could possibly be. I found myself cringing quite a bit at the choices Bonner makes, and as he searches for the person calling him out online, the story is quite suspenseful. So if you think it starts slow, just wait because the end will make it worth it! I did listen to the audio via NetGalley and unfortunately, their app is not good, and it made the narrator sound a lot like a robot. However, from what I could tell of Kirby Heyborne's narration, he did a really good job, and I was really impressed with all of his inflections. I would definitely listen to him again (not on the NetGalley Shelf app) to see what he sounds like normally. I think going the audio route really helped me with the slow pacing of the novel at first, and once I got to about the halfway point I didn't want to put it down. I am still coming to terms with the end (WHAT), but it was not at all what I was expecting, and I am shook. The Plot has been called clever by a lot of readers and I am definitely inclined to agree.

Although I'm not an aspiring writer, I do free-lance work for a company and have been told too many times to count that I should write a book. As if! Although the main character often says anybody can be a writer, I have read or attempted to read too many books that prove the opposite. Jacob ""Jake"" Finch Bonner is a writer who met with success by making the ""New and Noteworthy"" column of the New York Times with his first novel. Unfortunately, his second and third attempts were not as successful so he turned to teaching at a third-rate MFA program. One of his students, Evan Parker, an arrogant jerk, has a self-proclaimed ""sure thing"" whose plot he shares with Jake. Jake agrees it's a certain hit. As time passes but the book fails to be published, a curious Jake finds out that Evan has died and has left the door open for Jake to appropriate the plot. Life for Jake changes on a dime. His book is everything he thought it would be: number one on the NYT best seller list and movie rights optioned with an A-list director. Life couldn't be better. That is until he receives an e-mail saying he is a thief. The attacks continue to be more specific and more public and set Jake on the path of discovering who is behind these attacks.This is a great suspense thriller. The pacing is good, the story original and the insights into writers and writing are enlightening. I did figure out early on who was behind the attacks, but how the story unfolded kept me reading.

I like to think of myself as not a stupid person but some words had me scratching my head and pondering googling them. Maybe that‚Äôs normal in the collegiate literary world, which would explain my confusion‚Ä¶.slight digression. I also wasn't a fan of how slow it was, however once we got to Part 3 it really did hold my attention and took off and I could not put it down!! About half way through a light bulb went off on where I thought it was going. Normally that would ruin an ending but in this case it didn't. It was well written for sure. "
135,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam-cooks-the-books--,Rating 4 out of 5,"Anybody can be a writer, right? All you need is a really great plot. And if you can't come up with one of your own, maybe you can...er...borrow one? Jacob Finch Bonner, once considered a promising young author, has done just that and hit the jackpot--#1 best seller, book tours, movie deal with Stephen Spielberg, beautiful young wife. But he's not completely happy with this fame and glory because he fears the truth will be revealed and it will all come crashing down around him.This is a slow burner of a story with a terrific twist ending. Along the way, the book delves into the moral issues that come up in writing and publishing--mainly, who owns an original idea, a storyline? The title and the choice of cover art are perfect for this novel with all the different permutations of that word. I have now read two of Korelitz's novels and have signed copies of two others on my bookshelf to be read, obtained at St Mary's College's National Literary Festival, October, 2019, where she was one of several authors who were interviewed. If anyone can come up with an original plot line, it's Jean Hanff Korelitz!I received an arc of this new thriller from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Many thanks for the opportunity."

138,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2592286-kerry,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 mostly for readability, enjoyment and storytellingI'm certain that listening to this immediately after the audio of Who is Maud Dixon was a mistake since a year from now I most likely will get the two confused. But writing and writers are a subject on my mind.Both books are mysteries that concern writers and writing. Both are at the heart about women who feel they deserve more in life. In Dixon there are many unexpected twists and turns where as in The Plot I felt pretty sure where the story was going but like an accident unfolding I could not look away or in this case stop listening and in truth felt unable to listen fast enough (without turning up the intended speed) to get to see if I was right and exactly how it would unfold. If I could have gotten the print at the library I likely would have stayed up most the night reading.This story about a writer and his use of another's plot poses many great questions about writing. This even more than Dixon was its strongest recommendation for me. Dixon really did not talk much about writing where as the Plot wove in some interesting writer knowledge and questions. The obvious: Can the idea for a book, its plot, be used by another. Are a plot and a trop the same?Does each person have a unique story to be told? Does that story belong to that person or can it be appropriated by another? and in what degree? Is it possible that there are story ideas out there, that if you don't grab and use them when they are presented/gifted to you (in a dream, idea, thought), that the story will eventually find someone who will write it? (I think I read something similar in Elizabeth Gilbert's novel, Big Magic). I wanted to think more about these ideas, considerations yet I was so engaged in the story, the plotting of it, the telling of it, that I found I put aside all questions/thoughts posed and was just anxious just to see where this particular story was going, where the author would take this story. Excellent story telling, a mystery I will be recommending for sure and one with ideas that will linger long after the plot has been forgotten. Well done Jean Korelitz 4.5 stars rounded up."

And that twist y‚Äôall were hyping up??? What the fuck????? I guessed it the second the character was introduced. Also, this supposed ‚Äúplot that is SO GOOD even an idiot can‚Äôt mess it up‚Äù is literally the stuff of lifetime movies. And the writing drove me NUTS!

141,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16061946-jaymeo,Rating 3 out of 5,"Jacob Finch Bonner is looking to write his next big novel. When arrogant Evan Parker walks into his MFA program‚Äôs writing class claiming that he doesn‚Äôt need help because he has the perfect plot, Jacob easily dismisses him. However, when he eventually hears the plot of Evan‚Äôs novel, he agrees that its a winning book. He tamps down his jealousy and moves on with his teaching career and own writing. When he eventually hears that Evan died without ever publishing his book, he steals the premise and writes the book himself. The book turns out to be an overnight success, giving Jacob the wealth and fame he desires. When he starts receiving threatening messages from someone who knows he is a thief, he decides to investigate Evan Parker and where he found the idea for his ultimate plot. I‚Äôm definitely in the minority with my opinion on this book, so please check out other reviews as well. This could be due to the fact that I listened to the audiobook, whose narrator spoke in a robotic monotone voice. For this reason, I highly suggest reading the written book instead of the audiobook. I actually debated quitting many times, but ultimately stuck with it and finished the book. Overall, I found The Plot to be a very slow-paced thriller with very little thrills. It took almost three hours of listening before anything happened. I also found that the third person narration took away from the authenticity of Jacob‚Äôs voice. I predicted most of twists early on and was underwhelmed by the actual ‚Äúplot‚Äù of Crib, as it was not as shocking as promised. This book just didn‚Äôt deliver for me. 3/5 stars"
142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113964905-eva-k-journeyofthepages,Rating 3 out of 5,"If you enjoy a very slow burn, an extremely complex plot and strong character development ... pick up The Plot by Jean Hanff Korelitz! This novel is a story within a story, a book within a book, and a plot within a plot that you will definitely have to pay very close attention to. The problem for me was that it moved so slowly that I had a hard time keeping that close attention. The plot (pun intended) definitely thickens with every chapter and every detail uncovered! It's a really interesting story but you cannot expect it to grip you. If it had been executed more like a thriller with a fasted paced edge and quickening to it, I would have enjoyed it so much more. But that's just me. Some readers LOVE slow burns and if that's you -- ENJOY! Thank you, Celadon Books, Macmillan Audio, and NetGalley, for a copy of this book for review! "

Of course, a mysterious antagonist knows the truth and begins to harass him. There were things I really liked about The Plot and things I didn't.Disliked:1) The antagonist was lame and barely threatening while Jake, the protagonist, was whiny, unlikable, and in constant pursuit of his own demise. 2) The identity of the mysterious antagonist was obvious from the very beginning. Liked:1) I loved the book within the book, aka Crib. I wish the author just wrote this book and let us all enjoy twists, turns, and drama.2) The end. It made me happy."

IT WILL BE MADE INTO A MOVIE, PROBABLY BY‚Ä¶ AN A-LIST DIRECTOR‚Ä¶ OPRAH WILL PICK IT UP FOR HER BOOK THING. IT WILL BE TALKED ABOUT ON TV SHOWS... EVERY BOOK CLUB. EVERY BLOGGER. THIS BOOK, THERE‚ÄôS NO WAY IT CAN FAIL.‚Äù -An actual quote from The PlotThe most pretentious and narcissistic book I‚Äôve ever read. It‚Äôs impossible to review this without spoilers so stop here if you don‚Äôt want this spoiled for you (or keep reading instead and DON‚ÄôT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK.)MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD:This is going to be a bit of a rant. I‚Äôll just list a few of the things I disliked the most.1. WOW, this writer has a high opinion of herself. I lost track of how many times she complimented her own writing and plot. The main reason I read this book so fast was to see what made the plot within the plot sO aMaZiNg. A plot and twist unlike ANY other. A thriller worthy of Steven Spielberg directing the adaptation and Oprah putting it on her book club (both of which happened in the novel p.s.). Never mind the fact that neither of them ever pick books of this genre to promote/adapt. If David Fincher was directing, then sure, maybe. It could‚Äôve theoretically made it onto Reese‚Äôs book club, yeah. But it‚Äôs like this author has never looked into Spielberg‚Äôs movies or Oprah‚Äôs book picks and just chose them both since they‚Äôre the most famous. After a very, very long time, we finally find out the ‚Äútwist‚Äù that took the world by storm. The plot unlike any plot the world has EVER seen (keep in mind, this is set in modern day. Trump is president.) You ready for it???*A mother gets pregnant at 15. Her future is ruined. She resents her daughter. They hate each other. When daughter is 16 she gets accepted into college early. The mother kills her daughter. (But on accident kind of?) She then takes her place at college since she‚Äôs such a young mom. The end.*In the hands of Gillian Flynn or Karin Slaughter I‚Äôm sure this could‚Äôve been a great thriller. I could even see it being on the NYT best seller list! But a book SO incredibly famous that flight attendants are used to passengers gasping on airplanes while reading this?? And everyone in every small town across America has heard of it within a year of release?! It was not executed well and the ‚Äútwist‚Äù (I don‚Äôt agree that is classifies as one) was completely anticlimactic. I‚Äôve read so many twisty thrillers that stand out as far superior to the fictional book ‚ÄúCrib.‚Äù I really am just floored with this author‚Äôs opinion of herself. 2. This book (and the book within the book) was SO boring. It blows my mind that someone labeled this as a thriller. The writing was very repetitive and the author over explained just about everything. You could cut out 150 pages and still read the exact same story. The protagonist is the absolute worst. You‚Äôre inside his head 90% of the time with very little dialogue and only a couple of side characters, so there‚Äôs no escape from his whiny, cowardly, pretentious stream of consciousness. I 100% would‚Äôve marked this as DNF had it not been Jimmy Fallon‚Äôs summer book reads pick (in his defense, he hadn‚Äôt read it yet).3. The MAIN ‚Äútwist‚Äù ending of this book was painfully obvious. Everything about Anna seemed off to me from the very beginning and the last quarter of the book felt like such a chore to get through since I knew e x a c t l y what would happen. The Insta love, the dark backstory, the difficulty in guessing her age, how similar her name is to freaking Dianna, and so much more. The obnoxious cherry on top was her excessive monologuing at the end like a dang Disney villain. 4. Okay, my last complaint is the author literally didn‚Äôt do anything wrong in the eyes of the law. Like his publisher said, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt copyright a plot/idea.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt plagiarize. He used different character names. He wrote it years after the original author died. Why was he so afraid?? Do you know how many books I‚Äôve read that have had nearly identical storylines/twists?! Was it ethical? Probably not. But it makes no sense to me why he was so stressed about it and why Anna was angry enough to kill him. Anyways, I‚Äôll stop ranting now. The quote I paraphrased at the beginning of this review was one of MANY singing the praises for the book within this book, and even for her own writing style. I have a feeling this author would get along swimmingly with Kanye & Trump."

And that is exactly what happens when his arrogant student boasts about his own manuscript and the ingenious plot therein. Bonner is tempted. How hard could it be to steal someone else's story? After all, a great story needs to be told, doesn't it?Years pass, Bonner writes and publishes the book and becomes an overnight success and all is well until he receives a much less than praising email accusing him of plagiarism. You know what you did. I know what you did. Are you ready for everyone to know what you did? I hope so, because I‚Äôm getting ready to tell the world. Have fun with your career after that.You would think the person behind the condemning messages is the rightful owner of the plot; but the thing is, he is long dead and buried.So, who is Bonner's accuser and what do they want from him?The reasons for my 2 star rating:-The superfluous and unnecessary use of parentheses in almost every sentence rendering the sentence long and painful to understand. Reading the dialogues was less excruciating than the rest of the writing.-The main character who is named Bonner by the author for reasons best known to herself, is a despicable, condescending and self-centered person filling half of the book whining and explaining the reasons for his failure. The book could have been much shorter.-The transparency of the plot and the lack of any major twist is disappointing to say the least.-What's the deal with the bottle-opener that it's mentioned a million times? Did i miss something?Naturally, the Evan in question would only require his first name, at least to anyone and everyone who‚Äôd known him. Evan, the triumphant rescuer of the kidnapped bottle opener. Evan, the guy who sat at the seminar table with his arms tightly folded across his chest. Everyone would know an asshole like that."

151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Here we have the second novel published this year that takes aim at the publishing industry with an arrow of suspense. Whereas Zakiya Dalila Harris's The Other Black Girl happens inside a publishing house, Jean Hanff Korelitz's The Plot happens in the writer's mind. Both novels hit their targets dead to rights, skewering the top hits-driven publishing industrial complex in its fickle heart. But The Plot's twisty moral ambiguity caught my imagination and not a few times, I had to catch my breath. Like many readers before me, I figured out the whodunit aspect long before the end. And yet, this did not dull the figurative sheen of sweat that broke out on my forehead as I felt Jake Bonner's fear of being found out as a writer who purloined a plot. What if I published a bestselling novel, knowing the story wasn't mine? Could I live with the guilt, and then worse ‚Äî when it's clear someone out there knows what I did and they are really, really pissed about it ‚Äî the fear?But here's the thing. This question is what I love about this novel ‚Äî the nested mystery inside the mystery: was Jake really in the wrong? After all, every word he wrote in his Oprah-approved, film-optioned blockbuster was his. Whatever the answer is, I had to keep reminding myself this was fiction, and I was not this writer. Korelitz's prose is elegant, the story-within-a-story plot device propulsive. This is an irresistible read that falters in the blandness of its protagonist, Jake, and his too-sublime girlfriend, Anna, and the odd oversell of the world's most ingenious plot. The real mystery is that there really are so few storylines to go around, and yet terrific, original and satisfying novels keep being written. The Plot is one of them."

While the beginning is a bit slow, the second half clipped along at a rapid pace and it kept my interest throughout. I especially enjoyed the glimpse into the writing and publishing world. There were some brave choices by the author. The cat and mouse game between the writer and his internet troll/stalker felt, at times, a little like the game the author was playing with the reader. Aside from the fun and devious ""plot"" of the book, I found the ponderings of the protagonist interesting as he debates the ethics of appropriation to justify his actions. As society increasingly looks for stories told by authors with lived experience of the subject matter, in their own voices, this book asks who really owns a story? Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for an advance copy!"

It‚Äôs a story about a writer, a plot, a book within a book, and the mess he got himself in. It started a bit slow, but then it got engaging till the end. Highly recommend it. "

It was slow out the gate but as soon as she came on the scene I knew where this was going. This was my first book by Korelitz and it was very addictive to say the least. Her writing style is very unique. This is a book to grab and read straight to the end. You won't be able to put it down, I was hoping I was wrong and did not have it figured out from the beginning. But I still enjoyed it.I gave The Plot 4 stars and I recommend it. The Mary Reader received this book from the publisher for review. A favorable review was not required and all views expressed are our own."
156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2870295-shaun-hutchinson,No Rating,"This was interesting. I found the bits about writing and publishing more interesting than the thriller itself. The story idea that Evan comes up with and that Jake thinks is some kind of story that's never been told before turns out to be pretty pedestrian. I think it would have been better not to reveal it. But not doing so would have broken the rest of the story. I guess if you're going to claim an idea is so perfect that it's going to be an instant success no matter what, I'm expecting something outstanding. The twist within Jake's story was pretty predictable too. Nothing that happened over the last 100 pages was much of a surprise, sadly. Still, a fun read."

159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17755575-wendy-sthoughts,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 Be Careful What You Wish For Stars* * * * 1/2 Spoiler FreeWhen I saw this blurb, I clicked immediately. As a reader/reviewer, the art of writing is near and dear to me. I started it, dug in, and was captivated by the two major points of this book. Yes, it is a mystery/thriller and I loved that...but it also put out there this bare, raw, and vulnerable reveal of what it is like to have that need, that desire to write, to appreciate the wonder of what words can do.Our main fella isn't really a hugely likable character. The main thing about him is his early understanding of words and stories. He was advanced in his observations and decided to read books way more advanced for his age. He grew to realize writing was something that needed nurturing, devotion, and a focus to the point of sacrifice. He worked harder, applied to all the necessary programs, awards, scholarships, anything that would advance him in the writing field.And then it happened, after all the years of schooling, programs, and dedication, he was published and recognized as a promising new voice. He experienced that feeling...it was a high like no other. His book had made a little mark for him and then he needed to do his second book to hold onto his place among those who were considered worthy. It was that second book curse, he experienced it and never really recovered from it. He was published after many submissions, it never being anything to be proud of. He was on that ugly spiral, the downward journey that had him becoming what many shift to...a teacher. It is as this teacher for a program for those who wish to write and come to for guidance. It was almost a joke to have him teaching this as he had no real concern anymore for these minds. He did when he first was hired for the program but now he was just marking time and cashing the small check.This story starts to move forward when we get to the major set-up for this book, an arrogant, entitled guy is part of this session, and his attitude in how he behaves has us immediately disliking him. The joke, of course, is he won't talk about his project when the group first meets and it seems the only reason he is here is to try to get an agent and put a program on his resume. Full of himself would be the perfect description.This guy has a scheduled time to meet with our teacher and before the meeting, our teacher searches for the required submission needed for the course. It is read, then re-read because it isn't the usual drivel he gets. No, this is different. It is descriptive but with few words. You feel the place and who the people are...the conflict and pain just under the surface. Prepared to deal with this ass, the meeting starts. It is during this meeting, our author is juggling, dancing back and forth with this guy. It finally comes down to the challenge from the guy daring him to ask about this ""Sure Thing"" plot for his book. After a back and forth of mental gymnastics for the power play, the guy tells the teacher what is his plot. It is devastating...It is something that defies all the rules of plotting, of how there are only so many that can happen. It is perfect and everything the jerk had said that would happen when he writes this, will come true. This is the first part of the book. Heady, right. The book is done in parts and the next one is three years later and our writer has continued down his spiral of non-writing becoming a manager for a writers retreat. It is while he is there when his life will be presented his writing crossroads.I could not stop reading this, even when I needed to do other things. It presented an interesting theory about the responsibility of words and how the gift of something given needs to be taken seriously, how there is this purpose that must get them out, to not turn your back on them. To revere them, nurture them, and take on their responsibility. Yes, there is so much more than the concepts of writing, there is a terrific mystery/thriller story too. Our fella took on so much more than he ever could have thought when he decided to go on his path with his new book.

I thought, damn this must be the best book of the year!! Last night I got pass the line for the book if I agreed to read it in 5 days. Well, pffft, five days is nothing, right? Silence. I read the book in one night and I guess I totally ""lost the plot."" What is the hype about people!? I'm clueless. This was one of the most boring ""thrillers"" I've ever read, not to mention the fact that not only was the fictional plot stolen, the premise for this book was as well. Wait, was that the point? A plot within a plot within a plot. Oh, I don't know. Just no more ""thrillers"" or suspense for me. Apparently my thrill factor days are over. Now, carry one with your hype. Interesting note: The book is getting a ton of stars here at Goodreads, not so much love at my library after the fact or on Amazon. Hmmmm.... "

So many things that happen and so many things that the main character, Jacob, talks about happen in real life! Jacob is a struggling author turned teacher, who through a series of events ends up stealing the plot of one of his former students stories and becomes a bestselling author. When he starts receiving threats to expose him for stealing the story, he starts looking into his former student's past. This book is thrilling, exciting and totally nerve-racking! It definitely had me on the edge of my seat and reading well past my bedtime as Jake was trying to put all the pieces of the mystery together. Highly recommended for fellow lovers of thrillers!!!"

163,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25309949-lotte,Rating 4 out of 5,"it's rare that I can figure out the big reveal in a mystery so early (which in this case, definitely wasn't due to my excellent sleuthing skills, many reviewers have pointed out that the central mystery is fairly predictable) and still have a great time reading the book without getting frustrated in any way. the writing and the (at times bitingly funny) observations about life as an author kept me intrigued the whole time and made for a really enjoyable reading experience!"
164,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17792052-amy,Rating 4 out of 5,"It's almost impossible to review this book without giving a thing away. I do feel like the one thing that might be interesting to talk about, is whether a book idea can be truly stolen. When the publishers were met with the question, it was clear to them. An idea can not be stolen. And just because one has an idea, doesn't mean they can write it, or get it published. Many themes and tropes are used all the time, and many ideas blend into one another. In her book Big Magic, Elizabeth Gilbert tells the story of having had a particular idea. She had some of it flushed out. She went to lunch with a novelist friend, and they never once spoke of it. Not even a word or reference to it. She got busy and distracted with other projects and never got the book written, despite it having been flushed out. One year later, the novelist friend published her well known novel. It was the same exact idea, flushed out in the same exact way, in the exact setting and plot. Coincidence? I remember a few years ago, where there were three Mata Hari books out at once. Someone in my main group (CW I believe) suggested that it was because the 75th anniversary. Perhaps, but that was indeed strange. I have also noticed more than once that a flush of books emerge on a particular topic that isn't even current or prominent, but rather obscure - I ask again, can an idea or plot be truly stolen? Now of course in the book, the Plot, there is more to it than that. For one, our central character feels an immense guilt that is hard to understand, but that drives the story plot. The question becomes deeper, what if the plot were based on a real story? Whether you know it or not, is any plot that has a remote resemblance, stealing? Or are our stories so similar enough that it wouldn't have mattered. To whom might it truly matter? We get our imagination from our own lives, so is it stealing if it is adequately disguised? If it mirrors too close to the truth, even without knowing, is there a blame aspect required? Now the book is a fun thriller, but what does it say about writers and writing, and whose story is it to tell?An interesting phenomena happened while reading the book. And the book within the book, which promised a twist that no one saw coming. I wanted to comment on reviewers and twists. We seem many of us to get abject pleasure in ""having seen the twist a mile away"" or having been blown away by ""I didn't see that coming."" People in their reviews seem to love to announce that they predicted the twist. Why is this I ask? And yet I had that thought with this book. I felt I knew exactly what was coming, and often I don't quite..... But the need to announce that to everyone? That I knew it early? (If indeed I did....) Well who does that serve? Why as a book reading culture are we caught up in announcing whether or not we saw it in advance? Even I found the desire to do so, and caught myself and say, ""well who cares, and what on earth is that about?"" I don't think we should be congratulated personally, for outsmarting the author. It's about the joy in reading the tale. And enjoying the twists, whether you are right or you aren't. The book was fun, and layered. And worth a read. Four stars from me!"
165,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5899398-kyra-leseberg-roots-reads,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsJacob Finch Bonner saw moderate success with the publication of his debut novel. Unfortunately, his second release failed to garner any attention and he fears he‚Äôs fallen into obscurity. He finds himself teaching creative writing to others and knows all too well the starry eyed dreams of the hopefuls who fill his class. One student stands out: Evan Parker, tight lipped about an idea he has for a novel yet arrogant enough to brag to anyone who will listen that he‚Äôs come up with the perfect plot for a runaway bestseller.Jake is ready to brush off Evan‚Äôs arrogance but then he hears the plot ‚Ä¶and he has to agree that it is going to be a complete and total success.A few years later Jake discovers Evan died soon after the creative writing course ‚Äî presumably before he could finish his novel or even reveal his idea to anyone else. Jake can‚Äôt forget that incredible plot, in fact, it‚Äôs too brilliant not to share with the world. So Jake writes the novel based on Evan‚Äôs idea and finally has the fame and success he's longed for as an author; he even finds love on his never-ending book tour. He‚Äôs enjoying every moment of his success until he receives the first of many brief and menacing emails: ‚ÄúYou are a thief.‚ÄùJake‚Äôs life could come crashing down at any time. In order to find out who knows the truth, he has to learn more about his late student and what he uncovers is that his bestselling novel may not be fiction after all‚Ä¶The Plot is a story within a story. Readers follow Jake‚Äôs story and as it progresses we get excerpts from his novel. When the plot of his novel is eventually revealed, it was a letdown because it is a pretty formulaic thriller twist. That choice seems to be tongue-in-cheek commentary on the author‚Äôs part; Korelitz delivers some amusing insight into the publishing world and a writer‚Äôs life. The story is at times clever with the way it appears to poke fun at - while paying homage to - the ‚Äúpsychological thriller‚Äù genre trends of the past decade, and I was hoping Korelitz would deliver a truly surprising twist ending. Unfortunately, the twist was glaringly obvious to me and I was left thinking this is just your average middle of the road thriller which means a highly entertaining beach read but nothing shocking or new.I recommend The Plot to readers who enjoy psychological thrillers, suspense, and books about books. Thanks to Macmillan Audio and NetGalley for providing me with an advance audio copy in exchange for my honest review.

166,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75183808-kathryn-in-fl,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 STARS""THE TWIST"" as an alternative titleNo SpoilersThis is my first Jean Hanff Korelitz novel but assuredly not my last. She is a highly skilled author and delivers her story with aplomb. The reader is highly engaged from the beginning and is led through the story by the narrator thoughts and reactions as the observant fly on the wall.Jacob Finch Bonner is an author of limited success. His first book was a modest success but the following three stories were mediocre and though he knows he is talented that doesn't seem to correlate with fame or name recognition or even money for him. He relies on teaching to pay his bills living a life of near poverty and focused on a gangbusters idea to success. One day, a mediocre student delivers the hit of the decade for plot and Jacob is tied in knots at not conceiving it. He awaits its publication but years pass and not a squeak is heard, leading to his discovery that the student died without publishing the story. So, Jacob writes the story and becomes a big hit. However, that isn't the end of this tale, no it is really the beginning.We suffer Jake's angst at being non-productive and then the high of being ""that famous author"" and then later to his anxiety prone life which is always over shadowed by the secret he carries and the threats of being unmasked. Someone knows how he learned of this plot and they want him to admit that he stole it. However, there is a bigger matter that is never quite obvious. Though I did figure the twist before the reveal it was just a few pages before it was revealed, that wasn't a problem. I was delighted how Korelitz wrote the story and the pieces tied together. The characters make this story and they are well drawn and memorable. One never completely empathizes with any of them completely, as they are drawn with flaws, however, the reader is always highly engaged. ALWAYS. What I liked most is that I even wondered if Jean was male because she seemed to capture the way I believe a man thinks. I'm not sure what male readers perceived but she seemed to capture his slight arrogance as a professional writer having to interact with less superior persons attempting to write (students). His interaction with the females in the story reflected a male persona as well (I'm not inferring anything here).I will be back to read some of this author's prior and future works. If you like character driven stories this is one to put on your reading list."

This surprising ‚Äúplot within a plot‚Äù narrative just grabbed me and wouldn‚Äôt let go. Now, I was hooked, and this amazingly, well-crafted book had me in its clutches until the very end. Jacob Finch Bonner, author, has one bestseller under his belt, but the second is eluding him. He begins teaching other aspiring writers at a second-rate collegiate program where he comes across obnoxious student, Evan Parker who brags that he has a best seller plot. One evening Evan gives Jake a brief synopsis of his plot and after they go their separate ways. Later Jake learns that Evan has died and decides to use his plot to write the book which become an instant best seller. Soon he begins receiving threatening emails from someone who knows he has stolen Evan‚Äôs work. I won‚Äôt even begin to delve into the complicated subject of plagiarism. In this case, the story was never written, and Jake wrote the book with his own words. However, what transpired next was quite engrossing and riveting. I was transfixed up until the very end and must confess I did not see the shocking end coming. Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher, Celadon Books, for the opportunity to read this fabulous book. I look forward to more books from this author. I gave this book four stars. "

177,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54138240-zachary,Rating 1 out of 5,"When writing a book about a plot that is so unique, so fantastic, that it will simultaneously become a commercial hit and an instant classic, divulging the details of that plot is a risk. This is because the author must actually be able to deliver such a story. At first I thought Jean Hanff Korelitz would avoid this by cutting away each time the plot details came up‚Äîwhat I thought was a smart move. However, once the plot is actually revealed, it is no where near the caliber described in the book. Coupling this with the fact that the thriller itself possesses a twist that is discernible from the jump makes the whole thing feel like a waste of time. It could be argued that the visibility of the twist is a comment on the protagonist‚Äôs character, but that doesn‚Äôt make this a novel worth reading. Some of the most squandered potential I‚Äôve encountered in a long time. "

181,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17148107-lisa-leone-campbell,Rating 5 out of 5,"Writer Jacob Finch Bonner is a one semi-hit book author. Years ago he wrote a fairly well received first book, with a not terrific selling second book. As years have gone by and he is still struggling to write a third book, with no luck, he now works as a writing teacher at a Master‚Äôs Program coaching who he feels are inadequate and undeserving self-centered wanna-be writers.At the beginning of the current semester, he come across a student who not only is egotistical, but insists that he will become the number one best-selling author of all time because he has thought of a plot which not only has never been conceived, but a story that will blow people‚Äôs minds. Jake has heard and seen this type of enthusiasm before, but from this student, Evan Parker, he sees something else. An absolute surety in his story.Jake of course does not believe Evan Parker, and tells him. He asks for proof that Parker really has written this great American novel. Parker refuses to let him see any of his writing because he says he does not believe another writer would not hesitate to steal his plot. But Jake being the teacher finally convinces Parker to let him read a few pages of this novel. And Jake begrudgingly sees that Parker is correct. He will have a blockbuster on his hands.As time goes by and Jake continues to attempt another novel, and moves on to a different school, he continually awaits the publication of Parker‚Äôs novel because he knows for sure it will be sold. But the book never comes out. Jake decides to do a little digging and discovers Evan Parker had died. Jake realizes this could be the opportunity of his lifetime knowing Parker did not discuss the plot with anyone. He decides to write the book with the plot which Parker took to his grave.And just as Parker assured him, it became not only a best-seller, but he appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and Steven Spielberg is making the movie. His life went from writing an ok book to being a famous author. And he was enjoying every second of his fame!Until he receives an email out of the blue which changes his life forever. Someone knows his secret. They have made it perfectly clear they will expose him for the plot stealing plagiarist he became. Clearly, Jake has no where to turn. He is in too deep. He cannot tell his editor or publisher what he has done, his career will be ruined. He decides to ignore the email. But whoever the person is persists and takes their case to social media.Jake embarks on a journey to try and find out who this mysterious person could possibly be and figure out how THEY knew about the plot and somehow try and make them stop before his life is ruined. He begins to investigate Evan Parker‚Äôs life to see if there is possibly someone from his past (all his family is dead) who knew about Parker‚Äôs story.And what he begins to discover will shock, amaze and horrify Jake as well as the reader. And where the plot inevitably leads Jake will have the reader stunned.Jean Hanff Korelitz, author of You Should Have Known, which was turned into the HBO mini-series The Undoing, has written a terrifying mystery in The Plot which the reader knows only what Jake knows and we are all kept in the dark until the last page. Incredible!Thank you #Goodreads #CeladonBooks #JeanHanffKorelitz #ThePlot for the advanced copy."
182,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14670631-crystal,Rating 3 out of 5,"Jacob Finch Bonner was once an up-and-coming novelist with a bestselling book. Too bad his second book was such a flop. Now he's a down-and-out professor with a fourth book he'll probably never finish and students he despises. There is one student that has particularly incensed him: Evan Parker. Evan is arrogant enough to think he doesn't need Jacob's help or his lackadaisical teaching. When Jacob hears the plot of Evan's novel, he realizes that Evan is completely right. That plot is a winner, which sends Jacob into an even further downward spiral of self loathing. Only, the book never gets published and Evan ends up dead. As Jacob sees it, there's no sense letting a perfect plot go to waste. So he steals it for himself and is catapulted to fame. The only problem is: Someone knows he stole the plot and is hellbent on making him pay. This book was a chore to read. The main character was dull as dirt, as was much of the story.As others have mentioned, this is a slow burn. A very slow burn. And not the good kind of slow burn that builds tension and suspense. The ""Good lord will something happen already?"" kind of slow burn. Because nothing of note happens until Part Three. Even then, I didn't find it to be a fast-paced read. That being said, I did like the twist at the end. It was very well done and unexpected. It was just the getting there part that I found quite tedious. And, honestly, that could be in part due to me rather than the writer. I simply didn't enjoy Jean Hanff Korelitz's writing style and didn't find it engaging. Other people may love it, so I do recommend trying this book out for yourself. I do recommend this book to anyone who enjoys academia literature, stories of writers and slow burn thrillers. Thank you to NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for an honest review. "

Then one day, he is contacted anonymously and accused of stealing the plot. Down the rabbit hole goes the professor as he tries to find the person who knows he stole the plot.For a while the book was a bit long and slow, but I stayed with it because I knew it it would become twisty and crazy per all the reviews I had read. And yup... It did. The twists are insane and definitely unexpected. Especially that last one which I caught onto only a few pages before it‚Äôs reveal. It was delicious. I love these twisty tales.This was a book within a book, which the cover alludes to, and I really got interested in the chapters of ‚Äúthe book‚Äù inside The Plot.

184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6915263-nev,Rating 2 out of 5,"Zzzzz‚Ä¶. How could a book with such a promising concept end up being so boring? Jacob, a washed up author teaching at a writing program meets a student with a stellar book concept. When that student ends up dead before publishing said story, Jacob decides to take the plot and write his own book with it. After he becomes wildly successful he starts receiving anonymous messages saying that the sender knows Jacob is a thief. First of all, the writing in the book made this story hard to get through. It just felt super overwritten and pretentious at times. Maybe that was on purpose in order to fit with the vibe of the main character, but it made it a slog to read. Next, this super explosive plot that‚Äôs never been done before and took the world by storm‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt anything that wild or new, in my opinion. The sections of Jacob‚Äôs book that are interspersed throughout the story were so fucking boring, it doesn‚Äôt make sense that it was so successful. Finally, the big reveal was pretty obvious and not a shocking twist. I‚Äôm just disappointed that this interesting plot ended up being so boring. It was a quick enough read and it kept me wanting to find out what happened. But I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the outcome. "
185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21442406-frosty61,Rating 2 out of 5,"Wow, I can't believe the stellar reviews for this book. Given how much of a disappointment it was I feel I'm being generous with a 2 star rating. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I really tried to like it. I think it's probably a case of this one just not being for me. My expectations were for an edge-of-your-seat thriller with chills, twists, and a quick pace. I got none of the above. The snail pace and long meandering paragraphs caused me to lose interest within the first few chapters. I ploughed ahead, certain that things would improve (all those fabulous reviews, y'know). Nope. The main character, Jake, is a one dimensional, self-obsessed jerk; the twists in the plot are easily predicted; there are no sympathetic supporting characters; and the abundance of detail added nothing to the story. On a positive note, there is more dialogue in the last quarter of the book so the pace improved a little bit."
186,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Plot had an absolutely brilliant, well, plot! A kind of cautionary tale for writers everywhere as one author, reaching for the spotlight once more, uses a dead man's idea to create the perfect bestseller...That of course is not the end of it and the Jean HK offers us an utterly compelling and hugely addictive story that twists and turns beautifully, has a thought provoking narrative on plagiarism and just what exactly defines it in a wildly entertaining fashion. Beautifully written and intelligently crafted The Plot is an absolute must read. Highly recommended. "

The huge plot reveal was a letdown, and the main character was the biggest wimp I‚Äôve ever read. I honestly do not understand all the rave reviews about this book."

190,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843912-switterbug-betsey,Rating 3 out of 5,"Jake Finch Bonner is a published author who has received some critical acclaim for a past novel, but has never achieved the kind of success and financial reward that he craves. After teaching at a ‚Äúlow-residency‚Äù writer‚Äôs workshop, he makes a decision that will alter the course of his life and career. It also prompts a moral question about his integrity, especially when a Twitter comment threatens to expose what he did.Korelitz made some style and structure choices that hooked me in immediately‚Äîthe novel within a novel format, although with a carefully navigated twist. It‚Äôs not the first novel to concentrate on stealing another writer‚Äôs work, but this one focuses on hijacking the plot. The prose and story conflicts are the work of the writer and protagonist, Jake, who ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù the plot from his former student, Evan Parker. Familiar tropes are used, although Korelitz made this her own story. However, for me, it had mixed results.Jake‚Äôs successful novel, CRIB, centers around a mother and daughter that dislike each other so entirely that their interactions are merely transactional. Jake is a competent writer with a talent for producing a suspenseful narrative, but lacked the imagination to create a brilliant plot. When Parker reveals his own story line, Jake is jealous and aware that Parker could produce a winner, and later finds an opportunity to make it his own. Korelitz adds intensity by not revealing Parker‚Äôs prized plot to the reader until close to the end, but I figured it out pretty quickly, anyway.In the meantime, Jake has been consumed with his success, his new girlfriend, and a movie version of his book, directed by Spielberg. He struggles with doubt elicited by the anonymous tweeter, and attempts to convince himself that he was scrupulous. What is the outcome, and what are the implications, when a writer covertly lifts a plot from another writer? What are the boundaries and ethics of a writer, especially when he cherry-picks the meaning of T.S. Eliot‚Äôs, ‚ÄúGood writers borrow, great writers steal.‚ÄùI‚Äôve read several Korelitz novels, and noted her talent for insights and characters. Perhaps it is my familiarity with her arcs, but I was able to figure out 90% of the late revelation before I finished the first third of the novel. Parker‚Äôs winning plot did not win me over, as I surmised the bombshell ‚Äústeal.‚Äù If that was the only idea that Jake ‚Äústole,‚Äù it lacked the gravitas he made of it, or that Korelitz presented. Even though it was part of Korelitz‚Äôs aim for us to question whether Jake‚Äôs actions were libelous, dubious, a transgression of his craft, it felt a bit feeble as the breathless disclosure. The actual ‚Äúplot‚Äù idea is available from the vapor, the place where writers‚Äô ideas collect and swirl; it‚Äôs not the kind of plot that calls out ownership. There was also an expository info dump at the finale, which was unnecessary, since most of the facts had formerly and slowly been signaled or revealed. And Korelitz regularly overexplained how Jake‚Äôs thoughts turned, such as writing that ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt really believe that‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt really think that,‚Äù not giving enough credit to the reader for tacitly understanding it without requiring her parentheticals.THE PLOT, despite its flaws, is still a dark, engaging book. It will appeal to escapist readers who want something deeper than Dan Brown and more literary than Liane Moriarty. If they make a series, I hope they do a better job than they did with YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN, which was made into the HBO prestige domestic thriller, THE UNDOING, which was a complete mess. But I can‚Äôt blame the plot changes on Korelitz. :)Thank you to Macmillan First Reads and NetGalley for an advanced reading copy."

The Plot is about Jake Bonner, a stalled novelist who is teaching at a mediocre MFA program. His book dreams of grandeur are unmet and he's having some trouble making rent. He grumbles about his lackluster years teaching students until he hears the plot of Evan Parker‚Äôs story. Evan‚Äôs narcissistic about his future acclaimed book, but even Jake silently acknowledges ‚Äúa good plot when he saw one.‚Äù Two years later, Jake‚Äôs a glorified receptionist at a writer‚Äôs retreat, and he has still failed to churn out a book. He recalls that unusual plot his student spoke about. In a moment of desperation, a quick search reveals the acclaimed plot has not been published because Evan‚Äôs dead. Jake takes this windfall and runs with it ‚Äì straight to wealth, fame, respect ‚Äì just as he‚Äôd always dreamed. Life would be perfect now if he were not being harassed and threated to be exposed for plagiarism. As Jake tries to figure out who‚Äôs behind the attack; he finds a connection that he can‚Äôt overlook. The Plot is told in two narratives with different writing styles. It starts off with Jake‚Äôs narrative when he meets Evan and continues in a present timeline. The other narrative contains brief excerpts from the novel Jake wrote. So, you get a story within a story. I struggled through the first 30% at a crawl. Besides not introducing anything more than I had learned in the book‚Äôs description, Jake‚Äôs narrative drove me batty. It was all mile-long paragraphs, infinite serial lists, and the most excessive parenthesis usage I‚Äôve encountered. I soon realized this writing style was a ploy to show how shallow and annoying was Jake‚Äôs character. And, yes, I found Jake terribly annoying. However, it was a chore to get through this part. Interestingly, each time the narrative would flip to the novel excerpt, I was engaged and couldn‚Äôt wait to find out more. But like I said earlier, you only get a few pages of this every so often. This alone proved the quality of the author‚Äôs writing to me. This and the positive reviews for the book kept me reading. It was unfortunate that I spotted the twist early in the book. And I do mean early. This wasn't a complete let down though, I was still curious about how the details would play out.  It wasn‚Äôt until the last 30% did I feel the story had begun in earnest. From this point on I was fully engaged in both narratives. But I found the suspense only marginal. Perhaps, since I didn‚Äôt engage with Jake‚Äôs character, I felt less urgency‚Ä¶maybe. Or if Jake hadn‚Äôt been so inept here‚Ä¶The way the ending came together made reading the book worthwhile. I especially liked the narrative in the final reveal, even if I found it somewhat predictable. This psychological drama was my favorite part. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy fiction with a less violent narrative."

I don‚Äôt get that feeling often when I read something. I wonder if the author ever considered this.I was really digging this book at the beginning to the point that I was talking it up to all of my friends. I just reached a point where the story got too stupid to tolerate.The book was way too long. It would have been a terrific short story. The author goes into so much unnecessary description of places and people that mean nothing to the story, she was just filling up pages. Long descriptions of not-shit characters who disappear after a few paragraphs are a sure sign that the writer is looking for something to flesh out a novel from a short story.Jake couldn‚Äôt possibly be charged with plagiarism for what he did. You can‚Äôt copyright a story idea someone pitches to you. If that were the case, people from publishing houses would be writing endless synopses of stories and nailing down the rights to them. He wrote the book from start to finish, the guy who told him the story died without leaving behind a paper trail, and Jake would have proof that he wrote the entire novel. There is no legal issue here at all. Perhaps a bit of a moral dilemma, but nothing to worry about in a court case.I was confused early on when Jake finds out that the Parker kid is dead and decides to steal his book. How he ‚Äústole‚Äù it wasn‚Äôt explained, and as it turned out, he didn‚Äôt steal the book, at least not a manuscript. He simply wrote the story that the kid relayed to him. P.S. It wasn‚Äôt such a shit-hot story.I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôm not alone when I say that for the last one hundred pages, I knew what was going on and had to put up with a slow wrap of the story. It‚Äôs not like it was some big, secret twist because I figured it out early and I usually never do that, I never really care. I hate mysteries, for the most part.Really dumb Things that Annoyed Me:1 - How did Jake not know that his wife had a baby?2 - That was some coincidence that Anna just happened to be working at a radio station where she could arrange the meet with Jake. It‚Äôs almost like her whole life up until then was preparing for a stranger to steal her life story and turn it into a novel.3 - Why would Anna go after Jake in the first place? She murdered her own daughter and prodding the author could bring out the true story.4 ‚Äì How could Anne go from psychopath who killed her entire family to dream girl who Jake‚Äôs parents loved?5 - How could she steal her daughter's scholarship?"

I‚Äôve read some people complaining about the writing style, really long sentences or the overuse of parenthesis, but that wasn‚Äôt an issue to me with the audio version.I found the dilemma the story presented really interesting. Is it plagiarism when you actually wrote every single word yourself? Do ideas have an owner? If the one who thought of a plot is dead, is it really dishonest to take it and write the book yourself? After all, everyones will want to read that story, so original and shocking it is (I lost count how many times this was said).My allegiances and sympathies for Jacob came and went all throughout the story and I really don‚Äôt know what I would have done in his situation (in case I had the knack to write a book, which I don‚Äôt).The first few chapters were a bit slow, but once Jacob publishes his novel and starts ‚Äúinvestigating‚Äù everything became much more interesting.I was not that surprised with the ending cause I called it (or some variation of it) almost from the 50% mark. I loved how the word ‚Äúplot‚Äù took more than one meaning at the end.A small issue I had with the story was that we‚Äôre told countless times that ‚Äúthe plot‚Äù was something spectacular, never been done, that every publisher would want to publish it and every person in the world would want to read it, so when it was finally revealed I could not help but think that we‚Äôve all read ‚Äúplots‚Äù like that hundreds of times, so I could not completely understand Jacob‚Äôs huge success.Good writing and an original plot made of The Plot a fun listen, with every piece of the puzzle fitting together at the end in a clever way.It was my first approach to the author‚Äôs work but I‚Äôll be definitely checking out some of her previous books. I can see how this will be one of the books of 2021."

I almost DNFed this a dozen times. But I persevered. Not only was this very slow to get interesting, but the beginning was kind of hard to follow. Again, I listened to the audiobook, so it is very possible this will not be the case in print. But the timeline jumps around a few times and I found it hard to figure out what was happening a few times.The characters are all assholes. Which, I typically do not mind. But Jake was the worst sort- incredibly arrogant and I found him difficult to read. I felt like I wanted to punch him at all times.Now- the ""plot""- I had an inkling of where the book within a book was going fairly early on. And I was correct. I also figured out where the other plot was going, as well. I actually figured out the villain as soon as they entered the story. So adding that to the fact that it took forever to get going, this made the book very disappointing. I kept reading to know what this fantastic plot was, only to be completely underwhelmed.As I said, I listened to the audiobook. I did not enjoy the narration, but I really think it was more the book than the narrator. The narrator was paced well and enunciated well. However, as mentioned before, especially the beginning was difficult to follow at times. Also my extreme disdain for Jake made me annoyed by the narration. Basically, if you decide to read this, I would try the print version. This did not translate to an audiobook well. This is coming from someone who almost exclusively listens to audiobooks since I listen while at work. 75+ per year. I was given an audiobook in exchange for an honest review. "

The characters are multilayered, consumed, and vulnerable. And the intricate, intriguing plot builds nicely to create just the right amount of tension and suspense, as it unravels all the manipulative personalities, questionable motivations, duplicitous actions, and complex relationships within it.Overall, The Plot is a compelling, cunning, tragic novel by Korelitz that started off a little slow for me but by a third of the way through, with its story within a story, the momentum started to ramp up, and it quickly became an addictive, enthralling read I couldn‚Äôt get enough of.Thank you to Celadon Books for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review."

But our Jake Bonner - the writer of one of the tales - is no Hamlet. Jake is an entitled author of one somewhat notable first novel, and not very introspective regarding his failure to replicate his early success. Instead, we see Jake moping and feeling very very sorry for himself as he struggles to make a living as a once-touted young author. Until he writes his soon-to-be-Spielberg-produced-phenomenon.Korelitz does a fantastic job painting Jake's sins in the gray area - a real reader's book, a real writer's book - to whom does a story belong? And who has the right to write it?The twist in The Plot is evident as soon as the twist in Jake's fictional blockbuster, Crib, is revealed to us but the ride to the end is still thoroughly thrilling. Does the bad guy - the worst guy - ever win? The answer is, of course, sometimes.Thank you Netgalley for this preview!"

I had been looking forward to reading it because it had so many great reviews. It started out with vivid descriptions of the creative writing and academic worlds, which I enjoyed. The style of writing at the beginning is sophisticated and detail oriented. I enjoyed the premise of the story and was curious to see where the author was going to take me in my reading. Yet somewhere along the line, the story began to lose me. Lack of suspense? Too much unnecessary detail? Too many ""coincidences"" of people just happening to fall into Jake's immediate presence at the exact times he needed them to? I cannot put my finger on it. However, I personally did not see the end coming in this one, so when it began to happen, I was naturally glued to my book until I finished it. I would rate it 3 1/2 to 4 stars. There are some very strong parts to the story, yet cliche driven parts in others. Yes, I am torn on this one."

There was one aspect I wish was included, I wish we could have seen Jacob actually writing the book and see his guilt struggle through the writing process.

Based on a well-received (but not well-sold) first novel, Jacob Finch Bonner has managed to secure a gig teaching writing at a low-residential program at a decently respectable small college in Vermont. He expects it to go like every other class he‚Äôs taught ‚Äî that is, nothing will come of it for any of his students. But then, one student says he has a plot that‚Äôs never been seen before, guaranteed to be a bestseller because even people who don‚Äôt read will want to read it, that will make its author rich and famous, and that will be made into a blockbuster movie by an A-list director ‚Äî every single one of every writer‚Äôs dreams all come true. After being told The Plot, Jacob ruefully agrees that this is indeed a likely scenario. But then ‚Ä¶ the book never appears. And, seeing and seizing an opportunity, Jacob decides to write it himself.
I probably wouldn‚Äôt have read this book if it hadn‚Äôt been for the writing aspect of the plot. And I really did enjoy that part of the story. It made me both laugh and squirm in recognition of authorly behaviors and thought processes. The rest of it, though ‚Ä¶ eh, very much a mixed bag. I ended up finding quite a bit of this book to be tedious. I think my problem was mostly that we‚Äôre told about that awesome Plot very early on. Then we have to wait ‚Ä¶ and wait ‚Ä¶ and wait to find out what it is. For me, there was probably no way The Plot was going to live up to all that anticipation, and sadly it did not. (I was definitely straining my brain to figure out what it could possibly be.) The road to the reveal shows Jacob‚Äôs new life as a famous writer, traveling the country to appear on various talk shows and at bookstores and concert halls (rockstar writer for real!) At intersections along this road, so to speak, are excerpts from Jake‚Äôs bestselling book. And they mystified me. I found them a combination of depressing and dull, written in a way that I probably wouldn‚Äôt make it through 50 pages of in a real book. I couldn‚Äôt believe anyone would read that entire novel, no matter what kind of incredible twist it was supposed to promise. Most interesting to me was that a few pages of the original author‚Äôs novel are also included, and I found his writing far more engaging. Jake keeps congratulating himself throughout the story on how much better his version is, but I wonder if that‚Äôs a sort of joke on him by the author. Then Jake starts getting emails from someone who knows he stole the book. And then, for me, the pace of the book went off-track. Jake would get an email ‚Ä¶ and then there would be pages and pages about his domestic life. Another email, and more pages of utter mundanity. The Person Who Knows starts a Twitter feed, and Jake feeds the cat. Etc. This pattern went on for about 50 to 100 pages too long for me. It should have felt suspenseful, and apparently does to other readers going by their reviews, but I was about ready to flip to the end to see what the twists were and chuck the book back to the library. I only read the entire thing to be sure I can give it a fair review. The story picked up steam when Jake finally started trying to track down his mystery harasser. This section was fast-paced and intriguing, and I hung on every word. We (at long last) learn what the twist in The Plot was (but I didn‚Äôt care any more, and I found it more sad than shocking). And then there is a Big Twist in Jake‚Äôs story, which I should have seen coming, but didn‚Äôt because I hadn‚Äôt cared enough to pay attention (and semi-spoiler I never read  Housekeeping, either; I did see the movie but sure don‚Äôt remember the details). So at least that did surprise me. I have a few issues with the Big Twist for Jake:First, I question that anyone can fake being a loving wife and empathetic, caring person for nearly a full year. I know sociopaths are supposed to be able to be charming and all, but so consistently, to everyone, for such a long time? Maybe I question that because I have a hard time pretending to like people I don‚Äôt, even in small doses (luckily, I like most people). But it seems to me that a person with a generally bitter nature would find it challenging to come across as so sweet all the time, without ever dropping the facade. Second, why did Di/Anna feel she needed to murder her daughter? The kid was moving out, and Di/Anna could have just packed up and left Vermont and done whatever she wanted, wherever she wanted. She barely made use of that scholarship, although maybe she would have stuck it out the full 4 years if she hadn‚Äôt also murdered her brother and gotten the money from the house, which freed her up to be herself again (sort of). Last, why send those emails and start that Twitter account, etc.? Nobody thought Jacob‚Äôs book was based on a true story, but even anonymously asserting that it was a stolen story risked somebody tracing those accounts and finding out it was not just stolen, but also true. Sheesh, why take that risk?This was a decently entertaining read, and would have gotten 4 stars if I hadn‚Äôt been so bored in the middle of the book."

It starts out as a slow burn, but then it grabs you and pulls you in, at least it did for me. This was a suspenseful thriller based on an author, Jacob (Jake) Finch Bonner, who is trying to write books but just not quite making it at first, so he resorts to teaching a creative writing class at the local college. One day he reads just a couple pages of his student, Evan Parker's, manuscript and can tell he is on to something big. He tries to tell him, but the student is so arrogant and rude he gets nowhere with him. Years later, Jake is trying to come up with an idea for his next novel and he remembers Evan Parker's manuscript. He curiously looks him up to see if he ever did write the book, but finds out that not only did he not write it, but he died not too long after he last saw him. Jake decides to write the book based on the basic idea, since he had only seen a couple pages, and then made up the rest. His novel is a smashing success and he becomes famous and rich. Fast forward to later, Jake met a woman, Anna, at a book signing, they fell in love, got married, they are happy, life is good, they live in New York, and he is busy working on his next new novel. Then, bam! Just like that Jake starts getting messages from someone who calls themselves ""Talented Tom"" accusing him of book theft, plot theft and plagiarism. Jake is horrified, terrified and has no idea who it is, since he knows Evan Parker is dead! Jake also basically knows that he didn't steal the story, since he only saw a couple of pages and wrote the rest himself, but since he is getting threats he feels guilty. Eventually the threats ramp up and his publisher gets involved and brings in a lawyer. They assure him that this always happens to famous authors and that as long as he did not blatantly steal from a published book or story he has nothing to worry about. But STILL, Jake is worried, Jake feels guilt deep inside. Guilt will eat away at your rational thoughts and actions like ants, and make you do irrational things... This story has many more aspects to it, much more happens and it keeps you wanting to know what will happen next, and just who is Talented Tom? You will not want to put this one down until the thrilling ending. I gave this audiobook 4 suspenseful stars! Get yours today, you won't regret it!

He had not seen Parker‚Äôs whole story, just a little of ‚ÄúThe Plot,‚Äù but he recognized the powerful and exciting theme; this was a story that would sell millions of copies. When Bonner published his book, he was careful to craft something new, not identical to Parker‚Äôs original work, but still ‚ÄúThe Plot.‚Äù After all, he thought, one cannot copyright a plot; the same ‚Äústories‚Äù have been told and retold for generations.

I did not think it was earned and really diminished the rest of the book in my opinion.But hey, you might like it and think it was a brilliant change in direction. And I did enjoy about 90% of it, so don't let me naysaying discourage you from giving it a whirl. I just doubt I will invest any more time in works by this author, too many other books out there whose authors have not betrayed me."

The narration very much reminded me of The Great Gatsby/The Secret History and it worked really well; at times I shook my head at the author, but other times I could not help but sympathize! As the story (and his life) started unraveling, this book got more and more intense and I could not put it down! Although ultimately the final twist wasn't entirely unexpected, it delivered enough of a punch that my jaw still dropped. I would love for this to be turned into a miniseries because it was just wow!"
212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63564549-matt,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved the unique premise of this book, it def falls more into the suspense category (and very literary style writing) as opposed to a thriller so I think I went into it with false expectations but still really enjoyed it! it lost me a bit in the middle but the final third was brilliant with some truly unexpected twists."

He‚Äôs frustrated and depressed. When the opportunity arises for him to steal a student‚Äôs idea for a novel, he takes it. When he finally achieves wild success and believes he has fully justified his theft, he starts receiving messages from someone who possibly knows what he has done. But as time goes by, who exactly stole from whom? Every once in awhile I totally miss out on a book. The Plot was one such book. I loved the story and also the story in a story. The author is clever and I truly appreciate the many layers of the story."
217,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14321329-christina-pilkington,Rating 3 out of 5,"Actual rating: 3.5 stars For the first half of this book, I was glued to the page. The writing style was a little strange for a thriller- long, blocky paragraphs with little dialogue and lots of telling instead of showing, but I was captivated by the story. At around the halfway point, I knew what the ending would be and it stopped being as interesting. And the fact that the main character was so oblivious to what was going on felt a little too unreal to me. And the epilogue at the end seemed so unnecessary. So while I think this book will work great for lots of readers, especially if they don't see the ending coming early on in the story, it wasn't that great of a thriller for me. "

The student dies and the teacher thinks that maybe he can write the student‚Äôs story and no one would know.A bit of a slow burn that still kept me interested until the last 1/4 of the book grabbed me. Don‚Äôt read tell-all reviews to prevent ruining the fantastic ending.
219,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/714583-anita-pomerantz,Rating 3 out of 5,"The Plot is hard to review without you know . . .giving away the Plot. I didn't really know this was a mystery/thriller going into it. I really enjoyed the beginning where we meet a disenchanted writing instructor and his difficult, unpleasant student. The student has this terrific plot idea and a few pages of his novel. He reveals the plot to the instructor after being unwilling to share it with anyone, and that kicks off the heart and mystery of the story.For me, the best parts of the book were some of the ethical issues that were raised about novel ideas and to whom they actually belong. The mystery itself was fine, but by the latter third of the book, it was getting boring. I feel they could have cut a bunch of pages without losing much.The end got my adrenaline going, and I liked it. Others said they saw it coming, but I definitely didn't. All in all, solid and entertaining, but I don't think this is a genre that really excites me all that much. I felt almost identical about The Woman in the Window. I just don't find them that riveting for whatever reason. It's a bummer because I used to enjoy books like this a lot more. The fact that this book overlays an interesting ethical question definitely made it more engaging overall."

I think it‚Äôs the writing style and voice of the main character but I honestly can‚Äôt put my finger on it specifically! I thought the premise for ‚ÄúThe Plot‚Äù was intriguing and it kept my interest the whole way following the mystery. The pacing took some getting used to since months/years would pass in a page or two, but it was always directly started so you don‚Äôt get lost and there was always a purpose for the time jump. This is a HUGE improvement from the author‚Äôs previous novel ‚ÄúYou Should Have Known‚Äù which I did not like. Like I would not be able to tell you this was the same author if I just read the pages! The writing flows nicely and the present day is interspersed with short excerpts from Jake‚Äôs novel, consistently building suspense and tension. A little slow in the beginning and repetitive at times, but I loved the ending and don‚Äôt want to spoil it so I won‚Äôt say anything more! ‚ÄúThe Plot‚Äù was a twisty, fun, addictive novel that I would recommend picking up upon release in May!

221,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82312876-silvia-c,Rating 4 out of 5,"A very interesting premise. I don't think I've read many books about writers (if any), so this got my attention, plus suspense/mystery is one of my favorite genres.I'd say the first part was a bit slow, but it did build up the suspense and made me care and understand Jacob better. I definitely wanted to know what the twists would be and how it will all end up.It is the type of mystery that you can figure out if you want and follow the hints and clues, which is something I appreciate a lot. At the same time the twist is really good and I loved the ending. For those that read it, or will read it, I don't know what that says about me, that I loved the ending, but what can I say, other than I like what I like.I recommend it to any person that likes the thriller genre."
222,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67851627-mark-turner,Rating 4 out of 5,"They say it is about the journey rather than the destination. This statement is especially true in regards to The Plot. I really enjoyed this book even though I figured out the twist halfway through. I enjoyed the journey Jake was on throughout the book, the characters he met, and locations he visited were extremely well written and captivating. Even though I figured out the ending prior, there is still so many WTF moments!"

Every person he talked to was annoying and unrealistically rude. Also seemed like the author was punching down at people who live in rural areas? It took me months to get through the main character's investigation, especially after I'd already guessed the 'twist'. I love being surprised by stories, I NEVER try to guess twists and I try my best not to speculate -- I like just letting the story unfold how it was meant to.

229,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian,Rating 4 out of 5,"I don't even know what to say about this one. It's a great book, and it really gives you insight into human behavior. I honestly did not see the ending coming, I thought someone was the ""bad guy"" but then told myself I was wrong. And then I found out I was partially right. I will say though the reason why I am giving this 4 stars and not 5 is that the first part of the book starts off really slow (push through) and then we get the ending which I thought was cold (and I loved it by the way). But having the ""bad guy"" do a villain monologue took away from things a bit. I rather it had been short and to the point to make it more devastating.¬†""The Plot"" follows Jacob Finch Bonner. Once seen as the next bright young thing in the literary world, Jacob after some failed releases is now teaching MFA at a low level college in Vermont. When Jacob meets a student named Evan Parker whose excerpt causes his imagination to start firing again, Jacob feels jealous of the young man. Jacob knows that Evan's story is going to be a blockbuster and waits to hear about it. And when the story never comes, and Jacob finds out Evan has died, well Jacob starts thinking.....and then we jump forward to Jacob's novel ""Crib"" taking the literary world by storm. But when some anonymous person gets on social media and calls him a ""thief"" Jacob gets worried that someone out there knows what he did. And from there we follow Jacob as he finds out more about Evan Parker's life and death.So at times I felt so much sympathy for Jacob. I can't imagine how it feels to have been on top (somewhat) of the world and to find your life not working out the way you want it to. And when you get to ""read"" Jacob's justifications for what he does, you can almost see and agree with his point of view. But as Jacob plays detective and finds out more about Evan Parker my sympathy for him left. He doesn't seem to care about Evan or the rest of his family. And heck he even uses a former student that was friends with Evan to find out what he could possibly know. Jacob is just focused on not being found out.¬†The secondary characters that come the most alive to me though or the characters we read about in the excerpts from ""Crib"". Jacob can write. He has a way with words. You feel for the characters and I kept wanting/wishing that we had that standalone novel somewhere where we could read it. I usually don't like a story within a story, but Korelitz did a great job with this and showcasing Jacob's writing along with his quest (yes we find out the major plots that all books follow in this one).¬†The writing was very good, I liked how developed everyone was in this. I felt things as I was reading this and shook my head a few times and even gasped here and there. The flow was a bit off to start with though. I think things don't pick up until after we see Jacob's success. The first few pages/chapters had me going good grief.The book setting moves around a lot, we have New York, Seattle, Vermont, and even down south.¬†The ending though was great. Except for the longish monologue. I loved the epilogue though.¬†"

231,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,Rating 4 out of 5,"The first time I started this I had to put it down. I was absolutely not in the mood for Jacob and spending a whole book with him. The second time was easier, I knew ahead of time that I hated the protagonist, and I did it on audio which often means I am less picky about such things. And I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed it.The way Korelitz had me really hating this man but made him just smart enough and just capable of change enough to not totally detest him was a tightrope walk but she pulled it off. It opens the door to a plot that is a lot of fun to turn around in your head, that echoes a lot of the current questions around what is ethical for writers to use in their fiction. At first, though, a lot of things about the titular plot annoyed me. I rolled my eyes at the idea of a ""silver bullet plot."" But after a while I let myself go with it. I let the book exist in a kind of surreal world where an idea can be a sure thing. (There is no idea that is a sure thing!) So when we got to the details of the actual plot it was an inevitable let down. This is a common problem in thrillers, keeping a secret for too long, hyping it too much, can create a disappointing third act. This one wasn't so terrible, but it definitely wasn't an actual silver bullet plot. And I often found myself missing the idea of the book as a work of surrealist satire rather than the more real world thriller it ended up being. But at least Korelitz knew how to up the ante and give a nice twisty ending. It was, in the end, satisfying. So I forgive the book for being what it is and not what I imagined. It is a fine line, though. Some thriller readers will find this takes much too long to get started. Some literary readers may find that it's too much of a thriller for their taste. But I think it's a nice sweet spot and we could use more like it. Just maybe with protagonists I don't hate quite so much. :)"
232,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76596-kirsty,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a fun one! One of those books you race through, and think about when you're not reading it. I think Korelitz sets herself up at a bit of a disadvantage by describing the book-within-a-book in quite such gushing praise, describing it as having the most incredible twist in the entire world, and utterly unlike any other book that's ever been written ‚Äì¬†this could have been tongue-in-cheek self-consciousness, except that every character agrees that it's incredible, and it's a massive hit, instant bestseller, Spielberg making the movie etc. There are extracts of this incredible novel, and sure, it's fun, but it's just a good-quality thriller. It was quite easy to guess both the twist in the book (as in, who the culprit was) and also the twist in the book-within-a-book ‚Äì¬†it was so obvious that it grew frustrating to watch the protagonist bumble around not knowing what was happening. But I don't mind if I guess the end of a book as long as the journey to get there is still enjoyable, and in this case it definitely was. Other reviewers have said that the beginning is slow, and it is compared to the rest, but I still enjoyed it ‚Äì mostly because Korelitz is so scathingly accurate about the life of a midlist writer, and that stuff is catnip for me. If you've been looking for a fun, smart, absorbing thriller, this is certainly worth a read."

I ate this story up! There is just something so fun about a plot that discusses another plot. It's a two-and-one deal that did not fail. The protagonist, Jacob Finch Bonner demonstrates the reality for writers in the current writing industry. We get to see the ups and downs of his career while following the thrill of the plot of his book Crib. I did realize the last twist pretty early on but it didn't destroy my reading experience. I absolutely adored this and this book will most definitely be on my top ten favorite thillers of 2021.Thank you to NetGalley, Celadon Books, and Jean Hanff Korelitz for the arc!https://amzn.to/3DrqNg5"

The beginning was so slow and felt like a chore to get through. I found myself really annoyed about how often this super amazing plot is mentioned, without actually finding out what it is. I also guessed right away who the internet ""troll"" who accuses the main character of plagiarism was. I stopped reading properly at around 47%, but then skimmed through towards the end so I could see if my prediction was correct. It was. And that plot that kept being mentioned as revolutionary?

241,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256603-sara-the-librarian,Rating 2 out of 5,"This one left me scratching my head and feeling, once again, like I'm missing something everyone else was utterly thrilled by.A great deal of this review is going to have to go under spoiler tags because my ""eh"" reaction along with the reason for my new shelf ""wait, what?"" can really only be explained by getting into the meat of this story.I think that this book wants to be a great deal deeper than it actually is. As the story begins we meet the pretentiously named Jake Finch Bonner (the Finch is his own entirely unironic creation because he loves To Kill a Mockingbird) who is a washed up writer once considered ""new and notable"" by the Times but now relegated to teaching in a backwater, equally washed up writing school. Jake has lots to say about writing and how much he loves it. Lots and lots and lots. None of it is terribly interesting. Which I think is the point but is, nonetheless, not super fun to read about.As the latest semester of the writing program begins he meets one of his new students, a giant, flaming asshole who swears, loudly and frequently, that he is about to become the greatest novelist in the history of novel writing because he has the greatest story ever that no one has ever told before and it is so amazing that it will immediately be published, adored by millions, optioned into a film and propel him to fame and fortune forever. Jake scoffs at this. The few pages he's permitted to read of this supposedly brilliant book are fine, but nothing to write home about. But then in a private meeting with giant, flaming asshole he's told just what this story is and he realizes...giant, flaming asshole is right! This is the single greatest story in the history of novels! It will immediately be published, adored by millions, optioned into a film and propel giant, flaming asshole to fame and fortune forever! The seminar ends and giant, flaming asshole leaves to write the greatest novel ever written. But as the years pass and the greatest novel ever written never appears Jake begins to wonder what on earth has happened to giant flaming asshole? Why did he never pull the trigger on his masterpiece?A quick internet search reveals that Jake now has a choice. And when he makes it he will decide the course of the rest of his life and attract the ire of a dangerous enemy.So, on to my issues of which there are four. The first three absolutely contain spoilers so if you have any desire to read this go no further. Number 1: The question of morals and ethics...is kind of a non-starter Jake discovers that giant, flaming asshole died before getting the chance to write his book. So he takes the basic plot he learned at the writers conference and uses it to write the book himself. And I mean I get it, we're supposed to get into a deep debate over whether or not Jake is a plagiarist. We're supposed to think that the person who starts threatening him with exposure for his ""theft"" is at least sort of justified. But he's not a thief. He's just not. Should he maybe have revealed that he heard this story from someone and decided to use it? Yeah I guess but he didn't steal someone's manuscript and then write his name on it. Its just nowhere even close to the same thing. There's just no debate here.Number 2: The greatest novel ever written...is very much not the greatest novel ever written Not only has the story absolutely been told approximately a million times, (I can think of like three novels with the same plot just off the top of my head) it was lame all those times too! Here it is! A disaffected, overachieving teen is forced by her shitty parents to have a baby she doesn't want. She raises the baby until she too is a disaffected, overachieving teen but they kind of hate each other and then one day accidentally (?) mom kills her and kinda sorta assumes her identity to live the life she never got to have. The end.The book reveals this plot slowly because clearly the point is that the reader is meant to be totally shocked by the reveal that the mother kills her own daughter. Much is made over this ""crazy twist"" that no one sees coming and how very shocking it all is and I was waiting for, I don't know, aliens? ghosts? they're the same person? (that actually would have been cool) only to arrive at a very mundane story that I've seen every where from Law and Order to V.C. Andrews novels.Number 3: The big bad is...just silly After Jake writes his book its not long before he begins receiving increasingly terrifying messages from someone who knows he didn't come up with this story on his own. In all fairness why this person is tormenting him is pretty cool. I definitely got invested enough it what was happening to Jake and his fears of someone revealing that he'd ""stolen"" his story that I forgot to even wonder what the motivation would be for someone to try to out him. The reveal that giant, flaming assholes story was never his but was in fact stolen from someone else isn't enough to detract from the utter ridiculousness of whose it in fact is. Its doubly annoying because, if you know how these things work at all, its very, very simple to pick out the villain the second they're introduced and then everything unfolds exactly as you assumed it would. The character was introduced, I went ""oh they're the one"" and several hundred pages later I was right. This does NOT make me a genius, it makes the story lame and predictable.Number 4: The writingSo this one is all personal preference and should be taken as such. Jean Hanff Korelitz is a perfectly fine writer but I found the ""voice"" of this book especially grating. This is the first book of hers I've read so I don't know if its her style or a conscience choice but there are just so many italicized phrases and parentheticals and asides that I could never decide whether they were intended to be ironic and meant to paint Jake Banner as a pretentious nitwit or were actually supposed to be witty bon mots and winks to the reader. The ""quipping"" just became too much after a point. Like by page three.Then we come to the insertion of excerpts from the greatest novel ever written. There's virtually no change from the story of Jake's travails and the chapters devoted to his novel. Again, this is a personal preference but since this is not a first person narration completely in Jake's voice I'd expect at least some stylistic choices to indicate I'm reading two very different things. Something that tells me the difference between the fact and the fiction. Magpie Murders is a great example of an author who does this brilliantly. Instead we get the same dry if acceptable prose and the same dry if acceptable voice and I'm left, once again, wondering what in the world everyone thinks is so amazing about either of these books.I don't know if this was a simple case of too much hype spoiling the broth or if I just read too many mysteries or if there really is nothing new under the sun.I can't help but feel that had we never learned what the greatest story every told was this would have been a very different kind of book. Until it began to be unveiled in all its lackluster glory I was genuinely on the edge of my seat wondering about how amazing it must be. Of course given how the rest of the plot unfolds it wouldn't make any sense to have done this but if this was really going to be a book about the ownership of an idea and what stories writers have the right to tell it would have been super neat to leave readers having to tell it themselves."
242,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"The premise of the story is a compelling one. An author of a moderately successful novel has been trying to write another to establish his writing credentials. Although he has written several additional books, none has been remotely successful or even attracted much attention. Jake Bonner makes his living teaching writing seminars to graduate students. He spends his spare time agonizing over his writing attempts and at the prospects of ever reclaiming his career.Jake teaches one particularly irritating student. Evan Parker is obnoxious, arrogant, and overly confident, but he also happens to be a gifted writer. Parker reveals his plot for a book he is starting to write. Bonner is stunned and envious. Parker‚Äôs plot is so ingenious that it would be a crowning achievement for a seasoned writer, let alone a debut author. After the seminar concludes, Bonner loses touch with his former student. In the back of his mind, Bonner always expects to hear about the release of Parker‚Äôs book. Meanwhile, his career continues to decline. One fateful day, Bonner learns that Parker is deceased, never having written his book. The temptation is too great for him. Using the story‚Äôs plot, he writes his own book. It becomes an overnight sensation and bestseller.Suddenly, Bonner is in the spotlight again. His calendar fills with book tours and speaking engagements. He starts a relationship with a woman, Anna Williams, and they move in together. Not all of the attention, however, is welcome. Bonner starts to get emails from an anonymous person who claims he is a thief. The emails become more frequent and threatening. They promise exposure through social media. Bonner‚Äôs life which had been looking so bright with possibility becomes one of paranoia. Now he has someone and something to lose, Anna, and his newfound reputation. Bonner takes dangerous risks to avoid being exposed.Jean Hanff Korelitz has written a novel I raced through because of its plot, intensity, and unbeatable story. The work is well-written and has an incredible ending. This was a terrific read anyone with a curiosity about a writer‚Äôs inner life needs to get. It‚Äôs also a smartly crafted mystery."

I finished it within 24 hours ‚Äî I just couldn‚Äôt stand waiting to see how it all turned out!In The Plot, our focus is on Jacob Finch Bonner, a has-been writer who burst onto the literary scene years earlier with a well-reviewed first book, then flamed out on his second book and couldn‚Äôt even find a publisher for his third or fourth. He can‚Äôt bring himself to write, and supports himself through teaching at a mediocre MFA program that‚Äôs open to anyone who wants to write, no competitive admissions process required.When the super obnoxious Evan Parker shows up for Jake‚Äôs class, Evan is dismissive and rude, and asserts that he‚Äôs just there to get the initials MFA into his credentials. He insists his plot is amazing, can‚Äôt fail, and will make what he writes a huge bestseller and get him a major movie deal. Jake can‚Äôt believe Evan‚Äôs arrogance, but when he finally coaxes the plot out of Evan, he has to reluctantly agree that Evan has something unique and possibly quite valuable. Of course, it‚Äôs insulting that Evan insists that it doesn‚Äôt take writing talent to make a great book ‚Äî all that‚Äôs needed is a great plot, and he has one.Years go by, and Jake supports himself through online teaching and an editing business. But when he hears that Evan has died, he‚Äôs curious about the plot of his book. Surely, if someone had published such a story, he would have known. After googling and poking around, Jake becomes certain that Evan never did write his book‚Ä¶ and since the plot was never used and never truly left Jake‚Äôs mind, well, why not?Jake‚Äôs book is everything that Evan knew his plot would lead to. Crib is a huge bestseller, an Oprah book, and is about to be optioned by Stephen Spielberg. But Jake‚Äôs success is disturbed when he receives an email calling him a thief. His anxiety leads him into a deeper look into Evan‚Äôs life, and the more he digs, the more he understands about how someone like Evan could have come up with this amazing plot in the first place.I can‚Äôt go into more detail than that, because spoiling this book would be unforgivable! Suffice it to say that Jake‚Äôs investigation reveals plenty of weirdness and unexpected twists, and I found it fascinating.The Plot gives us a lot to think about, both in terms of the book‚Äôs storyline and the suspenseful elements, but also in terms of the world and inner life of a writer. As one character points out, ideas can‚Äôt be copyrighted. So if someone has a story idea but never uses it, and someone else knows about the idea and does use it, is it stealing? On the surface, yes‚Ä¶ maybe? Was it ethical for Jake to write a book based on a plot concept that, as far he knows, was never used and was never even written beyond the draft of a first chapter? If Jake took the story outline he heard from Evan and turned into a compelling novel, was that Jake‚Äôs work in reality? How much credit, if any, does he owe to Evan? The questions are fascinating to think about, and my feelings and opinions on these issues continued to change throughout the novel.I did pretty much nail the biggest plot twist early on, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that I truly figured it all out. I may have had a good idea of the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù, but the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and the ‚Äúhow‚Äù were surprising and really well put-together, and I loved all the little ups and downs of Jake‚Äôs search for the truth.I will say that the very end was not what I expected, and I‚Äôm still struggling with it! Not because it doesn‚Äôt work ‚Äî it absolutely does! But I will say that my sense of fairness feels upset. This is not the ending I wanted for the characters‚Ä¶ but it totally works in a very creepy sort of way.The Plot has lots of disturbing developments, but it‚Äôs not graphically violent. As I said, beyond the actual intrigue and action, I also appreciated the thoughts on a writer‚Äôs life, the highs and lows of success as an author, and the various questions brought up about who gets to tell whose stories and whether it‚Äôs true to say that each person has a story that‚Äôs uniquely theirs to tell.I think one sign that The Plot is really well done is that even though I felt disappointed by some of Jake‚Äôs actions and decisions and what these say about his morality or lack thereof, I still rooted for him and cared enough about him to want him to find a way out of the increasingly perilous place he finds himself.The Plot is one of the buzziest books this summer, and with good reason. It‚Äôs a fast, engrossing story that kept me hooked until the very end. Check it out!"

246,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39016044-rachaelbookhunter,Rating 2 out of 5,"The Plot is about a failed author, Jacob Finch Bonner, who is stuck with a job teaching writing. When a student comes to him with the plot for a novel that he claims will be a bestseller, Jacob is disbelieving. After hearing it though Jacob agrees. Some time passes and Jacob realizes the book has not been published because the student died. Hesitating only briefly, Jacob writes his own novel using the student's plot. Soon he has the fame and money he always wanted. But someone out there knows what Jacob did.I liked the idea of this book. Books about books or writer characters are enjoyable. So the first 40 pages, although slow, were very interesting to me. After a while though I began to notice the wordy sentences and long paragraphs. Something would be explained and then an extra 5 words were tacked on, repeating for emphasis the original statement. As I read I realized that I didn't like Jake. He was arrogant and thought poorly of people without reason. He also frustrated me with his lack of effort put into writing when forced to come up with his own plot. And speaking of ""plot"" the novel Jake writes is supposed to have an amazing plot twist. The plot of The Plot centers on this. It is supposed to be so amazing, never seen before that we can believe that readers everywhere would become obsessed with it. We get to read chapters from Jake's book, called crib. It isn't an action packed story so everything, from what we are given anyway, comes down to the end. I don't see the twist in Crib as anything special. In fact it's not a book I would enjoy reading. After Jacob's success he gets an email. Someone knows the plot wasn't his own. The communications become more frequent and nasty. All Jacob can think about is losing everything. I didn't feel any tension from this. The stakes seemed to be mostly in his head and he spends most of the book worrying. His editor and agent aren't that concerned and it's hard to see anything too bad potentially happening. He finally does a little investigating but I don't think Jacob reads mystery novels because he doesn't know how to ask questions. And when he actually has something to go on he does not put any of the pieces together. He is a little stupid actually. I was able to guess the villain as soon as they were introduced. It was obvious mostly because of the writing. It's hard to explain without spoilers but if the author had handled their introduction and inclusion in the storyline better, maybe there would have been some suspense. Probably not much though because it was also obvious there were limited options for the solution. This book took forever to get through. I think it was a bad idea to have the reveal from the villain's point of view. Their identity and motive wasn't a surprise. Their actions and plan were unbelievable. So the end was a depressing end to the letdown of a story. Due to Jacob's unlikable personality, lack of work ethic, and lack of intelligence I wondered if the author wanted us to be happy with the ending."
247,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11012155-sofie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Thank you NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for the audiobook for review!This is my first audiobook. Ever. I wish I had a ebook so I could look back on it while I write this review, but since I don't, I apologize for any vague references or misrememberings.First, the audiobook itself. I'll be frank: It was awful. It sounds like it was put together from a library of recorded syllables rather than an actual person reading, and the reader was so slow that I had to listen to it in 1.5x speed just to get through it. After that, though, I flew through this. The story was compelling, the mystery was enchanting, and the writing was as lyrical as Korelitz has Jake describe Evan's writing in the beginning. I do wish the voices had been a little more distinct, however, from the story of Jake and The Plot, to the story within the story, of Jake's novel, Crib, to even the first few pages we get to read of Evan's version of the novel in the beginning. The style was incredibly similar, and if it hadn't been for the chapter titles where readers are literally TOLD these are pages from Jake's novel within the book, I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference.The story is as unique as any mystery/thriller I've ever read. The meta-factor definitely helped with the originality, and it was a refreshing take on the genre. Do I think the plot (the actual story that starts all the drama, not this book, The Plot) is the best thing since sliced bread; as remarkable as Jake seems to think when Evan describes it to him in his office, guaranteed bestseller and sure to be picked up by Hollywood? No. Did I see the big bad coming from about 50% in? Yes. Was the ending pretty expositional and slightly eye-roll worthy? Yes. Can I think of better way to have ended the book instead? Well, no. So.All in all, a quick thriller that, while it didn't really keep me guessing, definitely kept me engaged, if for no other reason than I enjoyed Korelitz writing and Jake's character. I will definitely be checking out some of Jean Hanff Korelitz other books, and am grateful to have received this eARC!"

I was able to guess the plot/reveals ahead, but attribute that to good foreshadowing by the author.The book is also markedly similar to The Words (starring Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana) for the first 60% which I oddly didn‚Äôt mind since it worked to emphasize the ‚Äúmessage‚Äù in the book. I also had an unusual personal connection to one of the characters, which increased my interest and enjoyment. If you're thinking it's Jacob because I'm a published author, you're wrong! ;) I once attended a writers meetup and there was a guy there exactly like Evan Parker / Parker Evan (He wouldn‚Äôt share even a snip of his story because he believed it would be the next Star Wars). At the time, I was feeling very üôÑ& judgmental about his ego and inability/unwillingness to share or participate with all of us and now I don‚Äôt blame the guy!SUMMARY: a washed up novelist (Jacob) is teaching a writers course in Vermont. One of his students has a terrific story/plot, but he never publishes it... years later when the student (Evan Parker/Parker Evan) dies, the washed up novelist takes the plot and writes it. (It‚Äôs not plagiarism since he didn‚Äôt copy even a single word.)The book is mega successful and while riding high on his success/book tour, he gets a message ‚ÄúI know you stole it‚Äù and so begins the long journey/investigation into who is this person that knows and what do they want and was the plot truth or fiction!?! Periodically pages from ""the novel"" are chapters. It's brilliantly and beautifully woven together. I LOVE a book inside a book, 2-for-1 when executed correctly.OVERALL, This is definitely something that will keep your interest and turning pages! I look forward to more books by this author!UPDATE: A day later and I'm sad I can't read more."

As the tension built, I found myself increasingly eager to know what was going to happen. Jacob is a one hit novel wonder. He wrote a book at the start of his career that somewhat took off. Since then, he has been teaching writing at a mid to lower end university program, trying to replicate his success without any luck. He‚Äôs stuck in a rut and his self esteem is suffering. Then comes Even Parker, a narcissistic student who claims to have the perfect plot idea for a best selling novel. Evan is protective over his idea. He scoffs at Jacob and the university saying his idea is so good, he really doesn‚Äôt need any help in crafting his book. But in a rare moment of Even letting down his guard, he shares the plot idea of his book with Jacob. And so the story continues from there....This is a book that delves into the writing profession and publishing industry. It is both plot and character driven in that the reader is given an intimate glimpse into Jacob‚Äôs psyche and his transformation as things start going horribly wrong. I was taken with this audiobook but will be honest and say that I guessed the ending. I had a hunch early on and sadly for me, I was correct. However, the ending is fantastic and it appears that I‚Äôm in the minority of guessing the reveal as I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs super obvious. Regardless, this was a book full of tension and edge-of-your-seat moments as the mystery grew. The audio performance was well performed. Absolutely recommend this audiobook.

And so it does, after the teacher learns of the student's death and writes the book himself. My problem is that there is NO plot that is a guaranteed bestseller. None. And plots can't be copyrighted, and many similar books have come into the world after having been inspired by the same source material. Yet the author character is living in fear that his secret will be found out, even though he wrote every word of it. The twist was pretty clear early on. And the main character spends most of the book moping and being gripped with anxiety. He only starts doing things in the last quarter of the book. "

257,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,Rating 4 out of 5,"'The Plot' by Jean Hanff Korelitz has so many wonderful tongue-in-cheek moments about the ecosystem of being a writer of novels I knew this mystery was a crafty satire immediately! I started chuckling when I recognized a certain autobiography that supposedly a character in 'The Plot' had lived. The book is a slow-burner mystery, but for certain, imho, the mystery is not really where the fun in reading this book is. I guessed almost everything about the identity of a character when I got about 2/3rds into the book. Despite this premature identification of a murderer for me, I enjoyed reading 'The Plot'. Below I have copied the cover blurb:""Jacob Finch Bonner was once a promising young novelist with a respectably published first book. Today, he's teaching in a third-rate MFA program and struggling to maintain what's left of his self-respect; he hasn't written--let alone published--anything decent in years. When Evan Parker, his most arrogant student, announces he doesn't need Jake's help because the plot of his book in progress is a sure thing, Jake is prepared to dismiss the boast as typical amateur narcissism. But then... he hears the plot.Jake returns to the downward trajectory of his own career and braces himself for the supernova publication of Evan Parker's first novel: but it never comes. When he discovers that his former student has died, presumably without ever completing his book, Jake does what any self-respecting writer would do with a story like that--a story that absolutely needs to be told.In a few short years, all of Evan Parker's predictions have come true, but Jake is the author enjoying the wave. He is wealthy, famous, praised and read all over the world. But at the height of his glorious new life, an e-mail arrives, the first salvo in a terrifying, anonymous campaign: You are a thief, it says.As Jake struggles to understand his antagonist and hide the truth from his readers and his publishers, he begins to learn more about his late student, and what he discovers both amazes and terrifies him. Who was Evan Parker, and how did he get the idea for his ""sure thing"" of a novel? What is the real story behind the plot, and who stole it from whom?Hailed as breathtakingly suspenseful, Jean Hanff Korelitz's The Plot is a propulsive read about a story too good not to steal, and the writer who steals it. I did not think the book propulsive, but it was suspenseful as a light dramedy for me. Jacob isn't particularly likeable - he's too narcissistic. But he represents a type of person which I thought spot on and very funny! Did I see a bit of myself in the character of Jacob, perhaps? Not telling. *ahem*The novel is full of ironic sotto voce information about writers, writing and becoming a famous author! The plot is more about the variety (a sad and inadvertent comedy) of people who want to break into the New York City literary world, and what happens when they do. It's also about the anxiety of creating an ""original"" story without having echoes and restatements of other book plots and characters, which after two thousand years of storytellers writing stories is truly an impractical idea, basically. The chapters alternate between the fictional book Jake has written and Jake's 'real' (fictional) life, as well as the fact Jake's book is based on the life of another 'real' (fictional) character in the book cribbed from another writer/character, while we readers are reading about all of this in the fictional novel 'The Plot' - well, you see the fun the author was having, gentle reader! The writing is very good too."
258,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7510561-stephanie,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Plot is a slow-burning book that captured my attention right from the start because I was fascinated by the premise of the book, especially the idea of whether a writer can plagiarize an idea or a plot that's never been written by another person. The idea that stealing an idea or recycling ideas for writing is crazy since writers have been doing it for centuries-but so have artists, architects, and composers as they take ideas from the past and build and expand on them. Yet, in The Plot by Jean Hanff Korelitz, someone doesn't share this sentiment and feels that the taking of their story, their ""plot"" is stealing, and they're more than a little angry.Jacob Finch Bonner is a has-been writer. His first book hit the bestseller charts and proclaimed him a New and Noteworthy author; now he's teaching aspiring writers at an MFA program. When he meets Evan Parker, a know it all, who wants no help with his book because he says it's so good that it's going to be on every bestseller list and be made into a blockbuster movie, he's taken aback by his arrogance and confidence. Then Jake hears the plot of Evan's book and knows it's true.Three years later, Jake happens to wonder what happened to Parker's book since its never been published. After searching the internet, he finds out that Parker died a few months after leaving his course, never writing the book. This leaves Jake, now struggling more than ever with money and still no new book, with the idea that he should take the plot of Parker's book and rewrite the story into his own. After all, if Parker never told anyone (he shared nothing about it while at the college with anyone but Jake) and didn't write it, then no one will ever know where the idea came from. That's exactly what Jake does.Suddenly, he's a huge success. Everything Parker said would happen comes true-NYT #1 bestseller, a movie deal, Oprah, book tours, and more. Jake is famous beyond his wildest belief. There's just one problem: he gets an email that says ""you're a thief"", just one of many emails, texts, tweets, and letters from the person who knows what he did and is threatening to expose him. As Jake begins research into Evan Parker's life in the hopes that he can find who is threatening him, his career, and stop them, the pace and tension in the storyline amps up. Things start to get much more interesting from this point on, and the second half of the book is definitely the part that will keep you turning pages.Now, I did figure out who the person was that was sending him the messages almost immediately and guessed how the book would end, but that didn't really take anything away from the book because I while reading, I couldn't see who else it could possibly be. This really is more literary suspense than anything, and Korelitz has a mastery of words. The characterization was remarkably well-done although the characters were unlikeable, which was not a big deal, of course. The Plot is thought-provoking: who really owns a plot? Can you even appropriate an idea? Thank you Celadon Books and Jean Hanff Korelitz for the ARC. All opinions are my own."

Happy Publication Day!
 This book is now available in paperback and ebook. (Celadon, $28) Go get your copy today! ‚ÄúThe Plot‚Äù is gutsy and consequential; it keeps you guessing and wondering, and also keeps you thinking: about ambition, fame, and the nature of intellectual property. Are there a finite number of stories? Is there a statute of limitations on ownership of unused ideas? These weighty questions mingle with a love story, a mystery, and a writer's journey to strive‚Äîthree of the most satisfying flavors of fiction out there.---A book about a book. A plot about a...plotOh my God. This was so good. If you know me, you know I'm picky when it comes to mysteries and thrillers, and this one...this one didn't disappoint. I finally finished it a day before its publication date, and I couldn't be happier. The Plot was a bit slow in the beginning, but once we started rolling, I couldn't stop reading.We follow Jacob Finch Bonner, who recently became a literary God due to his novel Crib, the plot of which he stole from a former student of his. Jake is riding the wave of success when he gets a message that reads: You are a theif. As he struggles to understand to hide the truth from his readers and his publishers, he begins to learn more about his late student, and what he discovers both amazes and terrifies him. What is the real story behind the plot, and who stole it from whom?The writing was extremely difficult to get through at times, but Jake and his story kept me going through, and although unbearable at times, it was wonderfully poetic and actually kind of enthralling. Jacob struggles to the very end with what he once believe to be the truth: Anyone can be a writer, as well as: No one can tell your story but you. And guess what? I was SO there for it.Go read this book if you want a thriller that truly thrills! Not gonna lie, I got major Gone Girl vibes with that ending!"
260,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3112760-kristin-always-with-a-book,Rating 5 out of 5,"Thank you Celadon Books for the gifted copy.It's not often that I read a book so far ahead of it's publication date but I just had to with this one. This is going to be a book everyone will be talking about...it's that good! So mark your calendars for May 11th when this one hits the shelves...you will definitely want to pick up a copy or pre-order this book.I will say, this is a slow-burning psychological thriller but I found myself completely captivated right from the start. I absolutely loved all the commentary about the writer's world - some I was quite familiar with being a book blogger. I also loved the way the story was structured, alternating between what is going on in Jake's life and then the chapters from ""the book."" I found each equally compelling and both added to the overall enjoyment of the book, propelling it forward.This premise of this book definitely piqued my interest and then once I started reading it, I found I could not put the book down, but again, it's a rather slower read until that last third of the book when things really take off. This is when Jake is really in the midst of figuring out who is behind the messages and boy do things take on a life of their own. While I did figure out some of the twists, this in no way detracted from my overall enjoyment of this book because I still did not figure out everything. And the ending...just brilliant! I loved it! There are quite a few subtle twists and turns this book takes and it really kept me engaged and flipping the pages. I definitely recommend picking this one up when it comes out in May!You can see all my reviews at: https://alwayswithabook.blogspot.com"
261,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9827967-deb,Rating 5 out of 5,"I caved and purchased this book, because my library loan list was groaningly long. Partway into the novel, I wondered why I‚Äôd thrown down my hard-earned coin because my attention wandered. What was the charm? Such a SMART storyline- that‚Äôs the charm- since protagonist Jake Finch Bonner is underwhelming and almost unlikeable at first. Gradually, the frustrated and flailing author becomes an object of sympathy, as we join his efforts in publishing the book, the story he has had dropped into his lap and which might never otherwise have been written if not for him. ‚ÄúStories, of course, are common as dirt. Everyone has one, if not an infinity of them, and they surround us all at times whether we acknowledge them or not. Stories are the wells we dip into to be reminded of who we are, and the ways we reassure ourselves that, however obscure we may appear to others, we are actually important, even crucial to the ongoing drama of survival: personal, societal, and even as a species.‚ÄùHumour barbs this inventive ‚Äúplot‚Äù, as cat and mouse problems beset Jake. At times a psychological thriller and others, a philosophical look on the ethos in the world of writing and publishing, the structure of the novel reminded me of a Russian nesting doll - a matryoshka- as revealed by each layer. I always knew ‚Äúwho‚Äù - but couldn‚Äôt guess how it all would end. Kudos to author Jean Hanff Korelitz for her layered and zigzagging tale. Strong 4.5 stars and a ‚Äúplot‚Äù which I‚Äôll remember for a while. It was worth dropping my own coin. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

A relatively quick read that feels like a good quality thriller.I didn't really feel bad for the self-depreciating expert main character and his failures, as he seemed to be a terrible person overall. The twist was a bit easy to figure out but still very well executed. I enjoyed the ending very much: as satisfying as any ending in this type of book can get. I've read quite a few books about writers (including many from Stephen King), But fewer that delve so deeply into the fascinating world of publishing. I would recommend it for a quick and entertaining escape from the real world."

I LOVE them and am always drawn to anything with a book within a book, an author as a character or anything publishing related. This follows Jake, a struggling author trying to write his second novel. He‚Äôs teaching at a third rate school and meets, Evan a cocky aspiring writer. When Evan tells Jake the plot of his novel he‚Äôs intrigued. Fast forward a few years and Evan is dead so Jake takes his idea and writes the book. It takes off in a huge way, think Oprah‚Äôs Book Club, it‚Äôs been optioned as a movie and been reprinted several times. Life is good for Jake until he receives a note calling him a thief....Many people warned me that this one was a slow burn but that once it takes off, it‚Äôs pretty gripping. I can see that, but for me the audio was so well done that I honestly never found it all that slow. If a steadier paced book is an issue for you then consider the audio because the narrator was fantastic. I thought this was a really smart thriller and recommend going in as blind as possible. What I said above is pretty much all you need to know without giving too much away. The characterization was strong as was the ending, definitely a super solid thriller with a fresh spin "
264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9711335-mallory,Rating 4 out of 5,"I enjoyed this story but I think I had been expecting more. For a book about a plot with such a crazy twist I didn‚Äôt find this book to be very twisty at all. Despite figuring out what was going to happen I did enjoy reading it and especially liked the chapters from the narrator‚Äôs novel intertwined int he main story. The writing was good and the characters were well-developed (even if they weren‚Äôt particularly likeable). The narrator is Jacob who started out his career as writer with a lot of promise and was highlighted by the New York Times. His follow up book was significantly less successful and led him down a path to teaching creative writing at a third rate program. He hates his job and his students. At one point he comes across a particularly cocky student, Evan Parker, who has an ingenious idea for a novel that will make him famous and to Jacob‚Äôs frustration he agrees about the brilliance of the idea. Years later when he is reminded of that student he looks him up and finds out he died not long after the program. Jacob can‚Äôt help himself and writes a novel using the plot Evan had told him. He instantly rockets to success but someone starts to send him anonymous notes calling him a thief and a liar."

Don't read it in bed before going to sleep, because you won't have nice dreams if you manage to put it down. There's a very unpleasant novel (to say the least) inside a very intriguing one. In the beginning, everything goes slowly and I thought that it may not live up to the high expectations I had, but I was wrong.I didn't really like the main character. A writer who seemed to have lost all hope and whose life was boring until he found ""the plot"". Then he changes for the better and his life becomes more exciting. He also musters the courage to protect what he has achieved and the second part of the book is much more fast-paced and definitely undownputable.The final twist didn't come as a surprise to me. However, that fact didn't make it less appealing. The writer disappointed me again for his lack of foresight, inability to connect the dots and helplessness. The novel didn't disappoint me though. Jean Hanff Korelitz wrote it with the skill of an author who truly knows human nature.I recommend this novel to readers who are not easily appalled by how terrible people can be.www.theleisurediaries.blogspot.com"
266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49613067-jake-brzovic,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is simply one of the worst books I‚Äôve ever read. My wife said I should read it because she wasn‚Äôt sure what she really thought about it (she gave it a generous 3/5). Well, I read it and that was painful. It‚Äôs one of those books that seems like it‚Äôll be great and then you start reading and wonder why you picked it up in the first place. It was painful to read. The 300 pages felt like 800. So why is it so bad? First, you know who‚Äôs going to be blackmailing him the second the character shows up. It‚Äôs not even a question as there are no other main characters for it to be. The ‚Äúplagiarism‚Äù itself isn‚Äôt plagiarism in the least. It‚Äôs barely borrowing a story. It‚Äôs like saying Harry Potter is stolen from Star Wars. The ending was STUPID beyond words but I won‚Äôt spoil it for those who haven‚Äôt read it. Just do your self a favour and never read this book. You won‚Äôt care anyway. This was worse than Ready Player 2 and I thought that would be the worst book I‚Äôve ever read to the moment I died. I was wrong. This book is the worst I‚Äôll ever read. Sorry Jean, this sucked. Like this sucked beyond words. This book proves what you yourself wrote. Anybody can write a book. "
267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1065846-cindy,Rating 4 out of 5,"The plot of ‚ÄúThe Plot‚Äù certainly was interesting and unique. The story started out slow but as the tale progressed I became fully invested in the plot and the mind of the main character, Jake. Jacob Finch Bonner is a novelist who is struggling to write a novel that is successful. While teaching in a third-rate program in a lesser prestigious school he encounters a student who unbelievably has written a novel worthy of publication. Unfortunately or fortunately for Jake this student tragically dies. Jake doesn‚Äôt let this opportunity go to waste so he publishes this novel under his own name and becomes famous! Maybe not a good decision as he now receives threatening messages that promise to expose him as a plagiarist! The story intensifies as Jake tries to rationalize what he did and searches for the person who is about to expose him. I thought the story was original with a few unexpected twists."

273,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5194069-jenbebookish,Rating 4 out of 5,"Finished 06/14/20213.75 stars. Womp womp. Not quite a 4 star read for me, which is sad because I was particularly excited about this one, & for the first 1/3 I was actually really enjoying it! Was having 4 star feelings, aaaand was even thinking I could imagine giving it 5 stars if the ending really blew me away, which apparently people were saying things like ‚Äúread this for the ending!‚Äù So I had high hopes. But alas, it wound up being the ending that killed it for me. A few things‚Ä¶First of all, I saw the ending coming from a mile away. The moment the character was introduced, I knew it would be said character that was f‚Äôing with him. And as the story progressed and we were clued in on more details about how ‚ÄúCrib‚Äù, was similar/the same as real life happenings, I only became more and more positive that this character was in fact the one. Silver hair? I mean come on. It became blatantly obvious for me & as soon as the word soup was uttered I knew what was coming. All this made for a sorta spoiled reveal, usually I‚Äôm annoyed at the fact that I can never guess what‚Äôs going to happen the way so many other people seem to be able to, but having done so this time around, and so early on, I realize how thoroughly the fun is spoiled when there‚Äôs nothing left to guess. So definitely anticlimactic for me. Secondly, the premise of the entire story is that the mostly defunct writer Jacob Bonner is on his last legs as a writer, forced to sink to new lows in order to continue to support himself as a ‚Äúwriter‚Äù with writer gigs. Teaching writing at a school that‚Äôs basically available to anyone willing to pay, the kids coming thru the program are not exactly the rising stars of the writing world. But having already had his 15 minutes of fame with his first book that was somewhat successful, Jacob‚Äôs now stuck in writer purgatory having not been able to produce another success, & is forced to take this job that consists of humoring writer hopefuls. When Evan comes along, he is obnoxious in every way. Boisterous, rude, cocky (and not in a good way) and full of unsubstantiated confidence in his skill as a writer. Jacob reads some of his pages & attempts to give advice, & Evan rebuffs his attempts at helping him, so sure is he that he already has a golden ticket. He sets it up to Jacob like he already has a plot that is so luscious, so juicy and enthralling and unique that he is 100% positive that his book could not possibly fail. He‚Äôs thoroughly sure that he is the world‚Äôs next John Steinbeck & John Grisham all in one. It‚Äôs the infallible plot. Jacob of course accompanies this with the appropriate internal eye roll, that is until Evan takes him into his confidence and reveals this perfect plot. We don‚Äôt hear it right away, we only know that Jacob agrees with Evan‚Äôs assessment. It‚Äôs supposedly so amazing of a plot, that it inspires immediate jealousy in Jacob because now he too is positive of the book‚Äôs future success. It‚Äôs just that good. They are both certain without so much as an iota of doubt that it is a plot/book that will be turned into movies with top notch directors, it will be talked about on Oprah, it‚Äôll be on every best seller list. Comparisons to Steinbeck & Dan Brown & John Grisham, he is all of those authors in one, it will be both the great American novel AND a best seller with mass appeal. The hype is REAL. Of course we all want to know what this gift from god of a plot consists of, but I assumed the author would find some way to skirt around ever having to reveal the actual plot and just continuously reference it, cuz otherwise the author is going to have to actually produce some magical plot that sends shockwaves through readers at barely the mention of an outline. But this isn‚Äôt what happens at all. The overall outline/plot is revealed to be basically mom kills the daughter that she‚Äôs bitter towards cuz of all her own unfulfilled dreams & potential, then takes her place at college & la dee fucking dah. That‚Äôs a fine plot, and I‚Äôm sure in the hands of a proper author it could be titillating, shocking, all the things a proper plot twist generates. It has the makings of being a perfectly adequate thriller. But the infallible, perfect, ultimate, so-damn-good-i-know-it‚Äôll-be-on-Oprah-plot that they made it out to be?! Yeeaaahh‚Ä¶No. 100% No. To pass it off as such just felt phony, fake, & like the author thought we the readers were stupid. Like didn‚Äôt he expect that we were going to get curious about this magical plot? I guess it‚Äôs called suspending your disbelief, it‚Äôs something we have to do often as fiction readers, but still. For a book called the plot, all the hype surrounding the plot, only to have the plot be some mediocre second rate, dime a dozen thing? He‚Äôd have been better off going my route and trying to find a way from never revealing the full scope of said plot.And, last but not least‚Ä¶the ending of this book came with my absolute BIGGEST bookish pet peeve: the villainous monologue. I absolutely despise this tool that lazy authors use to give the reader info. Rather than finding a way in which to properly relay info to the reader, the author does THIS. They have the villain/bad guy/whatever in some way come face to face with the MC, then for some strange reason that makes no logical sense proceed to lay out a play by play of their every villainous move & motive. The ‚ÄúMUAHAHA, I got a knife from the kitchen drawer & then i waited in the hall way & hid in the cabinet and then jumped out when they got here and then stabbed him to death. I‚Äôve been waiting to do this since he stole my girlfriend 10 years ago! Then i wrapped up all the evidence and threw it in the trash‚Ä¶then I stole your mom‚Äôs car and waited for your dad so i could stab him too!‚Äù Okay so maybe it‚Äôs not quite so bad as that but it‚Äôs pretty damn close. There is never any situation ever in which a murderer chooses to give their victim a literal play by play of all the actions they engaged in, at any time for any reason. Murderers don‚Äôt sit there and explain things. They don‚Äôt find it necessary for you to understand things before they kill you. Authors everywhere need to stop considering this as a tool in their tool box, because once i come across a villainous monologue all bets are off. They‚Äôd be lucky to come out of it with more than a single star. It‚Äôs quite ridiculous, and bottom line it‚Äôs absolutely LAZY WRITING. Figure out a way for us to learn these things on our own!!!Sigh.I still chose to round this up in the end because I did think that the book‚Äôs first half was better than decent. I was fully absorbed in the story and in Jacob‚Äôs internal struggles. Jacob was not exactly the hero of our story, he was both unlikable and relatable. He was weak & insecure, which are of course very easy to understand. Who of us is not those things, at least some of the time? His superiority is a bit irritating, the fact that he seems to feel success is owed to him, & that he gets to be the judge and jury of writers and who‚Äôs deserving of success. Jealousy & envy are traits that are also easy to wrap our brains around, & of course Evan is portrayed to us as obnoxious enough that we don‚Äôt exactly sympathize with him either. I was torn as to how to feel about what Jacob did. Was it plagiarism? Not quite. But was there dishonesty in his actions? Absolutely. That‚Äôs another thing I thought about a lot. Based on how things went down, the chances of anyone being able to prove that Jacob ‚Äúplagiarized‚Äù anything are impossible considering that his writing was 100% his own! It was the idea that was stolen, Jacob took the raw idea and ran with it and turned it into something real. Proving the way this went down would‚Äôve been pretty much impossible so Jacob‚Äôs major stress out over this was pretty unfounded. If it were a crisis/attack of conscience that would be one thing, but spend your life dreading being outed? Eh. No doubt authors deal with stuff reminiscent of this all the time, without some sort of record of this idea somewhere that could be time stamped in some way, it would be no more than the word of some random crazy person against a famous published author. Just unsubstantiated claims. After writing this review I am seriously considering dropping my rating to 3 stars. There were so many stupid things wrong with it. I‚Äôm already starting to forget the feelings I had when I was enjoying the first half! Still, I think I‚Äôm going to stick with the 4 stars. Plot holes and eye rolls and all, it was still a good time."

Do I need to give up on thrillers?
Jacob Finch Bonner ‚Äî an author whose first book was a critical success, but who has been less successful with his follow-up publications ‚Äî has been compelled for financial reasons to take a teaching job at Ripley College. There he meets a student, Evan Parker, who, from the get-go, is so obviously smug about the incredible, so good, fantastic, brand new plot for his yet-to-be-written novel that Bonner finds it hard to imagine the plot to live up to its high expectations. But Parker relays the plot to Bonner after having submitted a measly handful of pages for review for the class. That's when Bonner realizes that Parker is correct. This novel with its unbelievable plot twist is going to make the biggest splash in the book world this side of the century mark.But a few years later he runs a rudimentary check on a search engine and sees that this arrogant guy (with the hair perpetually flopping over his forehead) has never published this phenomenal new book. In fact, after another search, he sees that Parker has died ‚Äî just a few months actually after leaving the class at Ripley College. So, Bonner does what he thinks any writer would do ‚Äî¬†he writes it himself. For how could he deprive the world of this amazing plot?Jacob continues along a nice path ‚Äî with this guilt and constant awareness poking at the back of his mind the whole while ‚Äî enjoying the success of his book, Crib (which is offered up within The Plot through a handful of excerpts). It has been chosen for Oprah's Book Club, optioned for a movie, and made all the best seller lists. He's traveling with book tours, scheduled appearances, and book signings. When suddenly, he receives an email that the sender knows what he's done. The threats to out his supposed theft increase and eventually become public. The legal team with his publishing house gets involved along with his agent and his editor. Meanwhile, Bonner decides to get in front of the anonymous instigator and try to discover who could be behind the increasingly threatening messages.Another book where I really liked some of the ideas put forth and the potential there, but felt the execution lacked in its delivery. It truly may be that thrillers just don't thrill me. At no point was I holding on in suspense. At almost no point did I wonder what was going to happen. The structure and play with words were especially interesting, but could not carry the weight of the entire book ‚Äî much less all three interwoven stories. I do admit to liking both the way Korelitz writes and the voice of Bonner as the narrator. But I never felt connected enough to his tale to truly care, especially once I'd figured out the forthcoming details early on. Also, the actual plot in Crib ‚Äî the book-within-the book ‚Äî felt incredibly obvious to me, which I understand would be the danger in hyping it up within the novel's interior to begin with. But it really made it a hard sell as I continued through the whole of the book. Crib was just not that amazing of a story for me to warrant all that effusion of brilliance.I wanted a little more by way of understanding and exploring the idea of who owns a story. What Bonner has done isn't plagiarism. But where is the line for theft of intellectual property? Who is allowed to tell the story? And when does borrowing or being inspired by something cross the line into outright thievery? But I didn't get that here. Bonner only seemed to briefly and occasionally wonder the same thing, but by reassuring himself in a way that allowed him to power through a moment of despair.All in all, not enough meat on the bone for my particular tastes. It was a middling sort of story and for once I never looked forward to the book within when those chapters popped up."

About the book: Jacob Finch Bonner was once a promising young novelist with a respectably published first book. Today, he's teaching in a third-rate MFA program and struggling to maintain what's left of his self-respect; he hasn't written--let alone published--anything decent in years. When Evan Parker, his most arrogant student, announces he doesn't need Jake's help because the plot of his book in progress is a sure thing, Jake is prepared to dismiss the boast as typical amateur narcissism. But then . . . he hears the plotRelease Date: May 11th, 2021Genre: Thriller Pages: 336Rating: 3.5‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êWhat I Liked:	‚Ä¢ The plot seemed so promising.	‚Ä¢ The writing	‚Ä¢ The two stories intertwined in the bookWhat I Didn't Like:	‚Ä¢ The ending..... Overall Thoughts: This started off so so so good. I wanted/needed to know what was happening. I loved that we had two stories going on at the same time and we would pop in between the two stories. It started to go down hill for me when Jacob went searching for the person that was sending the notes. If you stole someone's story would you try to find out the truth or just listen to the people around you and forget it? Finding out the truth exposes you to being the one who stole.As we progressed things bothered me. When the author says that Georgians call soda pop I was like nope, that's a sin!The cleaning lady at the school just happens to remember one student that was only there for a year who was quiet and didn't even clean her room. It's been like This book is obsessed with Oprah (mentioned 16 times) and James Frey(mentioned 4 times). It was kind of getting on my nerves.She killed all these people just so she could be a radio host helper? LolHoly shit that ending!!! Wow I was completely underwhelmed! That's the ending? It felt like the most distant ending. I thought there would be more to it based on what everyone was saying and the reviews. Final Thoughts: So it's a book... It's okay. Actually better than okay.. Like okay plus good. It's going to be forgettable for me though.

281,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31384215-sara,Rating 3 out of 5,"Unpopular Review BelowI looked forward to reading this book for months, and even spent my own money purchasing it instead of waiting patiently for a copy from the library. Regrettably, this book was predictable to me. The first 3/4 of the book were tedious and boring to read, followed by a fast paced, foreseeable ending. Lately I don't have very much time to read, and I prioritize my book selections so this was a big disappointment and waste of time for me."
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/442233-jen,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book starts off very slow but I promise you if you stick with it you will be rewarded with an amazing story! It centers on Jake, an author who had trouble maintaining success after his first book and is relegated to teaching writers courses at various schools. He talks to a very unlikable student who has an amazing idea, and when he sees later that the book hasn't yet been published, he takes the idea and writes it himself, to huge success. As time passes, he starts getting indications that someone knows what he did and tries desperately to protect himself.This book is uniquely told by alternating between chapters from the actual novel Jake wrote with the chapters of what is happening right now and told from Jake's POV. I was equally interested in both storylines. As I said earlier, it does start slow- the first 3rd of the book felt like a slog but I read the rest of it late into the night once it got going. The author expertly weaves a complex story in a way that is easy to understand and ties what seemed like disparate pieces together, with multiple twists throughout. Though I did figure out who the villain was, I enjoyed reading up to the point where it was revealed to see if I was right, and didn't feel let down that I had guessed it. There were additional surprise reveals beyond that one as well.I would absolutely recommend this book- rarely do I go from just pushing my way through a book like I did in the first part to finishing it and thinking ""wow, what an amazing story"". It's a unique storyline with an intriguing mystery, and Jake is a likeable (though flawed) character. Thanks to Netgalley for providing me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
283,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/593392-carolyn,Rating 5 out of 5,"I didn't like Jacob Finch Bonner much as The Plot opened. He was teaching creative writing at a summer program on a college campus. The symposium attracted adult writers trying to learn the craft and make connections with agents and other writers. Jacob, a washed-up, one trick wonder, was clinging to the literary success of his first novel, and trying to ignore the losers he had written since. He was bitter, sarcastic, and had no respect for the earnest wannabes who hoped to get a little help, or at least inspiration from a ""real"" writer. Jacob went through the motions, doing the bare minimum he had to in order to get paid. Then a cocky, insolent student, Evan Parker, tells Jacob he has sure fire best selling novel and explains the plot. Astonished, Jacob agrees it is the plot of a sure bestseller. He leaves the encounter feeling even more sorry for himself, reflecting bitterly that it wasn't fair that Evan Parker was able to come up with a great story idea, when his own writer's imagination had deserted him. That's the set up for a complicated and twisty mystery. The story was slow at first, and although I never learned to like Jake Bonner, as I got to know him I understood his frustrations and motivations, and began to root for him a little. If you've ever attempted to write a novel, or attended a writer's event, you'll appreciate the background and insight into the world of writing and publishing. The Plot is deftly written with subtle humor and unexpected turns. Highly recommended!"
284,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,Rating 3 out of 5,"Jacob Finch Bonner, author of a novel that achieved success many years ago, is teaching at an MFA program. One of his students, Evan Parker, discloses a sure-fire plot behind an as-yet-unpublished book. Jacob later finds out Evan has died. He usurps the idea and turns it into a blockbuster. When Jacob starts receiving anonymous threats, accusing him of theft, he begins an investigation to see if he can figure out the person‚Äôs identity. This book starts out as a mystery and turns into a thriller. Excerpts from Jacob‚Äôs book are included, so the reader will need to keep track of several layers of characters. I particularly enjoyed the parts about literature and the writing process. It is perhaps no surprise in a book entitled The Plot that the characters are thinly drawn. It might have been better to keep this ‚Äúperfect plot‚Äù a secret since it does not seem all that extraordinary once it is revealed. This book explores the ethics of appropriating an idea for a story. I am not sure I buy into the idea of a ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù in terms of an idea for a book, since so much depends on execution, but it was certainly entertaining. I listened to the audio book, competently read by Kirby Heybourne."
285,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81258772-jordan-jordy-s-book-club,Rating 4 out of 5,"QUICK TAKE: I love a good TALENTED MR. RIPLEY story, and while I didn't love love love THE PLOT, I ultimately really enjoyed it. It definitely feels a little long, but the ending saves what is a bit of a slower middle section. A down-on-his-luck author decides to teach a writing course and one of his students pitches him what is essentially THE NEXT GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL. Cut to two years later, said student has died, and the author decides to steal his idea for his own, cue the awards and accolades and Steven Spielberg movie adaptation. That is, until an anonymous person starts sending the author messages threatening to expose him as the fraud he is. I was onboard until the middle section, which is essentially the author trying to figure out who his ""blackmailer"" is, but the ending is dark and fun and twisty and worth the read. If I'm picking a fave of this genre, it's still MAUD DIXON, but I enjoyed this one a lot."

Nothing about the writing, characters or plot was pulling me into the story. Every single page I fought to keep going. Now I‚Äôm here sitting at a 2-star rating.On a positive note, the author is very much in the author world and knows how readers view authors. That is evident in the storytelling and the quips and call outs throughout The Plot. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not why I wanted to read this book. I picked it up after countless people spoke so highly of the plot and the thrills. What the heck did they read? Surely, we did not read the same book. The plot was slow to develop, the characters were boring, the book inside the book was boring, the ‚Äúplot‚Äù Jacob stole was not unique in any way, and ultimately, I saw ALL the twists coming a mile away. Maybe I would have appreciated it more if I was interested in writing. Doubt it, but maybe. No suspense, no thrills, slow and boring. "
287,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3900438-alma-katsu,Rating 5 out of 5,"The premise of this book is that a once famous but now down-on-his-luck writer steals (borrows?) a totally original plot from a former student when he learns the student has died. It's the kind of book you know is going to be THE book, the one everyone is reading and talking about. And it is--it changes his life.And then it all starts to go to hell when the author is stalked by someone who says they know his secret.It's a great premise but the only way for an author to pull it off is to come up with that once-in-a-lifetime plot, and how likely is that?Well, Jean Hanff Korelitz pulls it off. This book is like the ultimate locked-room mystery, only with the perfect plot at the center, and if that isn't catnip to writers and readers alike, I don't know what is. A deliciously satisfying read that would make a great book club book, too."

It will be made into a movie.‚Äù I am a longtime fan of this author‚Äôs campus novels, but this story within a story surpasses them all.Surely the most irritating question an author has to address must be ‚ÄòHow‚Äôd you come up with the idea for the plot?‚ÄôWith three stories in one, the intriguing premise of ‚Äòa sure-fire best seller‚Äô in this novel is what happens when writerly ambition collides with the idea of intellectual property or moral obligation and becomes plagiarism? The ingenious narrative construction takes time to get going, but the gradual jaw-dropping incremental revelations, with literary nods to suchlike authors as Marilynne Robinson and Patricia Highsmith leads the reader to the meta fictional clues within.My thanks to the publisher for the ARC via NetGalley."

Hate to report that I was correct regarding what I thought the big twist was going to be when I updated my status at 57%. Up to this point, I was really enjoying the book, which I can't deny is very well written. However, I've seen too many reviews of people saying you'll never see the twist coming, or that this book is just twist after twist. I feel like this is the kind of book you read FOR the twist, and it was just so painfully obvious what the twist was at just a little over halfway through it that the rest of the book was not very fun to read. Certainly not a bad book overall, but the twist was so bad and obvious that I really don't even think it can rightfully be considered a true twist ending. 3.25/5."

I almost put this book in the DNF pile several times, but because of the rave reviews I pushed on. The Plot started off super slow for me, and if I‚Äôm being honest, it didn‚Äôt pick up until Part Four with only having six chapters left in the book. I did have this book figured out pretty early on, and I‚Äôm left with a feeling of unease as I can relate to and know some people like one specifically referred to in The Plot. Yes, this was a good read, but unfortunately I think my expectations were set way too high due to all the high reviews. I would still recommend this book as it gives you a clear view from a writers perspective. "

298,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a book that verrrry much had me in its grasp, and which I really wanted to give five stars. But right from the beginning I told myself I was only allowed to do that if the hook of this book delivered on its central promise. And I don't think it did, not as much as the author wanted it to, anyway. The premise here is that a writing teacher (a once promising author himself) takes the plot of a novel from a deceased student‚Äîa plot which the student told him would be a guaranteed bestseller and make him tons of money, a ""sure thing""‚Äîbecause hey, he's not using it (being dead), and that premise *needs* to be written. Sure enough, two years later, our main character is a bestselling author, rich, with a movie adaptation on the way to be directed by Steven Spielberg. But he starts getting messages calling him a thief. Who is writing the messages if the student is dead? plot /pl√§t/a plan made in secret by a group of people to do something illegal or harmfulthe main events of a play, novel, movie, or similar work, devised and presented by the writer as an interrelated sequencea small piece of land that has been marked or measured for a particular purposeAnd we get to play with all of those by the time the story is done. In addition to the main plot of our main character Jake writing the book and then hoping not to get caught out, we also get excerpts from Jake's novel, which he calls Crib (a clever play on the double and/or triple meaning of the this book's title, as ""crib"" has multiple means as well). It is in this area that I felt the story didn't fully deliver, although to be clear what was there was great. But this guy (his name is Evan) makes the bold claim that no one has a plot like his, that it's a guaranteed hit, no one could mess it up, that it will make its author a millionaire, win him fame and critical acclaim. And he's right. So by the time we finally get around to seeing the ""twist"" that everyone is pooping their pants over, it has to live up to all that expectation. And I just don't think it does! For one thing, there are several interconnected twists in this book, but I called one of them almost right away, which had me primed to try and figure out what else was going on. So by the time I had that suspicion confirmed, the ""big twist"" at that point felt inevitable. I just don't think this is a plot that is as good as Korelitz thinks it is (or, at the very least, almost every single character thinks it is, in the world she's created). All that said, though, this was still great. I love the way that Korelitz writes about writing. I thought she navigated several complicated characters and fraught situations in a way that left me appreciative of their nuance, instead of being beaten over the head with a stick. The ending of the book is almost perfect, a hard enough thing to accomplish, but especially in a suspense novel. This book made me want to pick up writing again. I'm not sure whether I will pick up anything else from this author. None of her other plots sound as interesting as this one (heh). Although I did have Admission on my TBR for a long time, I finally took it off a couple of years ago because it had been there for over a decade without my having read it. The Latecomer sounds interesting, but I'm rarely in the mood for family drama. I guess we'll see what she comes out with next.[4.5 stars rounded down, coz of that plot, yo]"

And anybody can be a writer.""This book was another slow starter. I found myself constantly putting it down and leaving it for a while before picking it back up. It felt like I'd been reading for so long but not progressing with the story. But then, just over halfway through, the story starts getting better and better. And it was amazing.The idea of a book inside a book is so cool to me. I loved getting to read the story that the MC wrote. I did figure out the twist towards the end, and it was such a good one. I really ended up enjoying this book. Highly recommend."

It felt like much was made of what was in essence nothing."
306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie,Rating 5 out of 5,"In and of themselves, ideas cannot be copyrighted. So if you write a story or book with a plot that someone else simply claims to have thought of first, you're likely on pretty solid ground. But what if that someone shared his or her idea with you - even jotted down several pages of notes - and then unexpectedly died? You're positive it will be a best-seller if it's fleshed out, and in your heart of hearts, you know it's a story that begs to be told. If you do the telling, though, are you stealing? Such is the overarching question behind this mesmerizing book. It actually happened to Jacob Finch Bonner, who's had a couple of relatively nondescript books published but is hoping one day to hit the New York Times best-seller list. A student in one of his college writing seminars, a total jerk named Evan Parker, describes the book he's sure will be a winner, and Jake (secretly) agrees. Later, when Evan dies, Jake is faced with a decision: Publish, or let the story perish?Rationalizing that, as previously mentioned, ideas cannot be copyrighted and this is a story that must be told, Jake chooses the first option. And by golly, he was right; in short order, he becomes a writing sensation, landing on that coveted list and and Oprah's book club choices. Although he now must deal with his publisher's expectations for a follow-up book - one he knows can't possibly live up to the wild success of this one - for now, he's relatively content to enjoy the fruits of his (and Evan's) labors. That is, until he gets an email that tells a different story: You are a thief.Needless to say, he sees his now-stellar career in shreds, but on the other hand, he doesn't want to admit that he got the idea (and maybe more) from someone else. Now, he sets out to find who wrote that message - which in short order turns into many more, some even posted on social media. In the middle of it all, he marries Anna, his love from across the country (he's in New York, she's got a successful job directing podcasts in Seattle). Not wanting to worry her, he rationalizes, he keeps his so-far secret between himself and his publisher.The rest of the book details his search to identify his accuser and learn more about Evan as well as his struggles to write another book and keep his new marriage on solid ground. Interspersed are chapters taken from the book he wrote - the one he ""stole"" from Evan - and reading these builds awareness of what the story behind the story really is. I must say the first third or so of the book is a little slow, but trust me, once it gets going you won't want to put it down. Although I did guess early on who might be behind the whole mess, I had absolutely no idea the hows or whys, making the ending one that quite literally made me gasp.In short, if any book deserves to be on that NYT best-seller list, this is it. Many, many thanks to the publisher for sending me an advance copy to read and review. Wow!"
307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4484885-robin-loves-reading,Rating 4 out of 5,"Jacob Finch Bonner was a well respected novelist after just one book. However, for his sophomore title, he is hit with a hard case of writer's block. To make ends meet, he is teaching a program for aspiring writers, although it has been years since he has published. When someone taking the class, Evan Parker, tells Jacob of a plot for a book, Jacob is intrigued. Then, Jacob discovers that Evan has died, so Jacob takes on Evan's plot as his own and writes a bestselling book. The book has done so good that Jacob rises immediately to the top - including an offer from Stephen Spielberg for a feature film. He is a book thief, but who's to know?Now, wealthy beyond belief, traveling far and wide, Jacob's success almost comes to a screeching halt - and it starts with a single email - You are a thief. That is all it says. Jacob perhaps should have given the idea of Evan's plot some serious thought. Actually, Evan felt it was a sure thing. If Evan had not died, would he have achieved the very success that Jacob is experiencing? Who knows of Jacob's actions? Jacob now starts to dig deeper into Evan's life. Now he needs to know how Evan came up with the plot, and whether or not it had anything to do with his death. What was the plot based on, who was really behind it and who is sure to expose Jacob?That one email becomes many. Then there are the texts. But, it doesn't stop there. Threats are coming fast and hard, giving Jacob pause. However, the train has left the station and Jacob can do no less than to try and sort things out so that he never becomes exposed.Although I loved this thrilling story, there was a point I pretty much figured it out. Even though that part of the mystery fell flat, I was eager to see the journey ahead of Jacob so that the many questions and fears facing him would be resolved. The book definitely was intriguing, enough that I pretty much read it from cover to cover in one sitting. Having an idea who was threatening Jacob did not take away my enjoyment of the story. In fact, what it did was to keep me even more riveted to the events as they unfolded. I ended up loving this book and have already recommended it countless times. Although I received a print ARC of 
The Plot, 
I also got an audiobook review copy. I did have to speed up the book in order to feel a bit more engaged with the story. This is not the first time I have listened to this narrator. In fact, two of the books I have listened to were 
Gone Girl
 and 
The Wife Upstairs.
 Once I got deeper into the story, I was able to relax into the narration, and thus also have been recommending the audiobook to fellow readers. Many thanks to Celadon Books and NetGalley for this ARC for review. This is my honest opinion."
308,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23240493-angela-staudt,Rating 4 out of 5,"Thank you Celadon Books for an ARC in exchange for an honest review.The Plot was such an interesting and unique book. I would classify it as a mystery thriller, but I also learned so much from reading this book about publishing, writers, and reviewers. While the beginning was a bit slow and kind of a lot to take in, after a couple of chapters I was super intrigued. Once I got hooked into this book I did not stop until I was flipping the last page. It kept me on the edge of my seat and the way it was written had a big sense of thrill throughout the book.This follow Jacob Finch Bonner who is struggling with his career. He wrote a somewhat good book that became a best seller and now has no motivation to write. He is currently a professor teaching at a university to aspiring young writers on how to write successfully, only he has no motivation to teach these kids anything as he is facing that he will never be a big-time writer. One of his students perked Jake‚Äôs interest when he said the plot of his story is mind blowing and once he finishes the book it will be the best book ever written. Jake is very intrigued and sits down with Evan Parker and gets him to spill the plot of this soon to be famous book. Jake agreed it would become a best seller and everyone would be talking about it. Two years later, Jake is now doing random side jobs and remembers Evan Parker, but can‚Äôt recall ever hearing about his book being published. He googles Evan and realizes he died a couple of months after they met, and he never did publish his book. It looks like no one even knew that he was writing a book besides Jake. Jake ends up stealing the plot of Evan‚Äôs book and becomes an international best seller. Only is it too good to be true? Someone seems to know what really happened and starts accusing Jake of being a thief.I am so glad I picked up this book because it was so amazing. We get a story within a story because we get chapters from Crib, the book that Jake wrote that was based off on Evan‚Äôs plot. It was very chilling to read the chapters from Crib because it was a seriously messed up book. It is definitely a superb psychological thriller that has you glued to the pages wanting to find out more. While I did kind of figure out who was blackmailing Evan early on, I think the author wanted readers to find out. It made it kind of eerie to read this and know who the bad person was. I was still very shocked by the ending and had chills reading the epilogue. I honestly just really enjoyed the entirety of this book and it was kind of crazy knowing Jake stole someone‚Äôs entire idea for a book, but yet I was rooting for him. He wrote the book himself, he just used someone‚Äôs idea. If you‚Äôre looking for an exceptional thriller, pick up The Plot it will not disappoint."
309,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19738227-jay,Rating 3 out of 5,"And that kids, is why we don't plagiarize.The plot of The Plot (nice) is basically: unsuccessful author hears the worlds greatest pitch for a novel from one of his students from a creative writing class; is like ""shit, i wish i thought of this"" cause the plot of that pitched book is allegedly so great that it is GUARANTEED that it will sell millions of copies and get turned into a movie by an A-list director; then he waits for that student to publish said book, which never happens; he learns that students has actually died shortly after telling him about the novel; unsuccessful author is like ""well, it's free real estate then""; publishes said book himself; lives in constant fear of being figured out; one day gets a text saying ""you are a thief"" and from then on lives in even greater fear of being figured out.Couple of thoughts about this.a. don't steal an idea from a dead guy if you are not going to be able to live guilt free. like what was up with that? stop whining, you are getting a movie and no-one can actually prove that you stole it.b. the plot of ""Crib"" (the stolen book) is SHIT. IT IS SHIT. everyone in this was like ""holy guacamole, this is the best thing i've ever read, how did you come up with this, the plot is so unique, wtf"" IT LITERALLY ISN'T. i read like 6 books like ""Crib"" just last month. ""Crib's"" plottwist was laughable. if Korelitz just wrote ""Crib"" instead of writing ""The Plot"" i would have dragged them through the dirt. (this right now is a NICE review)c. the plot-twists of ""The Plot"" were also shit. also the reactions of our protagonist to the plot twists made no sense because he should know they were coming. he just should okay, i am not going to elaborate on this. and yet he is like ""what is happening"" every single time. you know what's happening??? And yet.The combination of the plot of ""The Plot"" and the plot of ""Crib"" (which I guess is also part of the plot of ""The Plot"" and therefore it makes no sense for me to distinguish between those two because the plot of ""The Plot"" does literally entail the plot of ""Crib"" but I just wanted to see how often I could write ""the plot of ""The Plot"""" until some yells at me) was kinda fun?So here, I'm saying it. Me, the thriller hater. Here it comes. I will try not to gag.This thriller did have some good moments. And it entertained me.I don't think I can give higher praise to a book that had a protagonist with zero braincells. THIS DUDE I SWEAR, SO STUPID???? YOUR OWN BOOK???Anyway. 3 stars."

311,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113333692-alex-nonymous,Rating 1 out of 5,"Thanks to the publisher for providing an early copy of the audiobook for The Plot in exchange for an honest review.While I get that books can have unlikable protagonists (especially in mystery/thrillers), those protagonists need to be supported by a really strong or compelling narrative to make sure you end up hating them and not the actual book and Jacob Finch Bonner is such an unlikable protagonist that it made this book feel really, really, long.I think a lot of the problem comes from having the narcissistic, judgmental protagonist be a writer because inevitably, it becomes very difficult to draw a mental line between what's the character showing those traits and what's the author. For example, after spending the books opening hearing Jacob judge everyone around him and think about how he's destined for greatness he is finally humbled through reading the work of a student that he describes in narrative as one of the best written things he's ever read. I assumed that was going to work as a summary for what the student wrote but then the next chapter, we read the perfect piece ourselves which (unintentionally) moves Jacob's narcissism to the author since we just read paragraphs of them praising their own work through Jacob's judgmental lens. This book is a whole lot of Jacob feeling awful with the real mystery not really kicking in until the 60% mark and at that point, I was so frustrated with the narrative that Korelitz could have told the best mystery of all time and I still wouldn't have been able to get invested."
312,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94480701-zibby-owens,Rating 5 out of 5,"""The Plot"" is about a failed writer named Jake who's watching his career descend. He can't write anymore, and his last book tanked. He has nothing in the tank. He is reduced to teaching in a lousy MFA program where they take anyone who signs up. He gets a horrendous student who waltzes into class and says, ""I don't need to be here because the book I'm writing is foolproof with a foolproof plot."" When Jake hears the plot, he knows the jerk is going to have massive success. Years later, Jake wonders why the book never came out. He discovers his former student died, and there is no book. Jake writes his own book and becomes massively successful. But he can't enjoy it because he's terrified that somebody's going to find out. Then somebody does. The rest of the book is a puzzle to figure out who it is and what they know. Jake has to ask himself: who was his student? Where did he get the idea? Did he take it from someone else. This was a very suspenseful plot, and it does involve a book within a book, so we to see some of the novel that's in question because everybody who reads this will want to know, what is the foolproof idea? Jake is complicated, and he has been so twisted by his perceived failure and the loss of what he thinks he deserved to have because he worked hard. I felt bad for Jake. I couldn't tell if I was rooting for him or not, but I wanted him to shout the truth from the rooftops.To listen to the interview with the author, go to my podcast at:https://zibbyowens.com/transcript/jea..."
313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14844044-michael,Rating 3 out of 5,"Jacob Finch Bonner is a writer whose glory days are behind him. Now resigned to teach at a third-rate MFA program in nowhere Vermont, he encounters an asshole student who says he has a great idea for a novel. One that is certain to make him rich and famous. Except the student dies. And Jake steals the dead student's idea. Wich makes Jake rich and famous. Well, what could go wrong? Apparently, everything. Great premise, right? But here's the rub: while I adore the premise, I didn't adore the book. I didn't hate it or dislike it, mind you. I just ""liked"" it, thanks to the author's foundational idea that's as original as the book is readable. The pages flew.On the flip side, my reservations became twofold. First, it was far too easy to deduce who the ""anonymous"" person was; the one threatening to expose Jake. So once that big ""reveal"" was revealed, I felt a bit deflated (though I have to say the dialogue portion of that part was written very well). Second, everyone in the book is either a dick or a bag of dicks. Which makes it really hard to root for anyone. Granted, we're supposed to dislike the protagonist, since he stole the idea for his novel from his dead Bag O' Dicks student. How warm and fuzzy are we supposed to feel about any of it? Not much, and I get it. But still. Almost everyone in the book is unlikable in some way, and some far more than others, even though the overall pacing of the novel was good and the tension pretty high throughout. A decent summer read. As long as your expectations aren't too high ."

So shut up and write.‚Äù‚ÄúOnce you were in possession of an actual idea, you owed it a debt for having chosen you, and not some other writer, and you paid that debt by getting down to work, not just as a journeyman fabricator of sentences but as an unshrinking artist ready to make painful, time-consuming, even self-flagellating mistakes.‚Äù‚Äú...I've always thought there was a kind of beauty to it, the way narratives get told and retold. It's how stories survive through the ages. You can follow an idea from one author's work to another, and to me that's something I find powerful and exciting.‚Äù‚ÄúStories, of course, are common as dirt. Everyone has one, if not an infinity of them, and they surround us all at times whether we acknowledge them or not. Stories are the wells we dip into to be reminded of who we are, and the ways we reassure ourselves that, however obscure we may appear to others, we are actually important, even crucial to the ongoing drama of survival: personal, societal, and even as a species.‚Äù"

We first hear from Jacob in his earlier years, and then after he publishes this career-changing novel. We also get to read excerpts from his book along the way, which I particularly enjoyed.I didn‚Äôt know much about the plot (ha) going into it. I find that book blurbs often taint my expectations, so all I knew when I started this one is that there was a grave on the front cover and that I enjoyed the author‚Äôs previous book! As you can imagine, this book was nothing like what I expected. I was so pleasantly surprised by this unique premise.I recommend going in without much information as well. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!On audio, it was a lot to keep straight. You have the real-life characters as well as the characters within Jacob‚Äôs book, and if I happened to pause in the middle of a book excerpt, it was a little confusing to figure out ‚Äúwhere‚Äù I was and who the focus was on. I was especially glad I had the book to follow along with!"
316,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110373082-monika,Rating 3 out of 5,"Thank you Celadon Books & Netgalley for the arc. I actually listened to this book on audio copy provided by Macmillan Audio.3.25/5 Plagiarism is a serious issue no matter the situation. One should never ever steal other person‚Äôs work. This is the core message of The Plot. Though the story started slow, I was able to connect with Jake and understand him as a struggling author / writing coach. Not justifying what he did, but Jake sounded like a sensible person who should have guessed the *someone* since he knew the story of *something turned* why did it occur to him only at the end rather than sooner? When I got ahold of the plot, I guessed the ‚Äúvirtue‚Äù of a certain character long before Jake did. This made me loose my grip with the story, but since it was an audiobook I continued to listen just to know how Jake comes to ‚Äúknow‚Äù. It was an okay revelation - guess this is what happens when one reads too many thrillers!! But I should say, the book with the book format was pretty cool. The writing was very good and the narration was decent, I felt the voice modulations could have been better. If you don‚Äôt read much suspense novels, this might impress you."
317,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4834343-martha,Rating 5 out of 5,"James Finch Bonner has become forgettable. His one published novel has faded from memory and he has no idea how to get an agent or publishing house to give him another try. He stumbles along in his sad little life, bringing his black cloud of desperation with him. He takes a job as an instructor at a writers' retreat, pretending to care about his students' submissions. But then he meets Evan Parker, an arrogant young man who has written a few chapters of his guaranteed best-seller. When Bonner hears the snippet that Parker submits, he recognizes great writing and needs to know more. Soon enough, Bonner takes the opportunity presented to him and ... intrigue and mystery ensue.From cover to cover, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Korelitz is a master at doling out little bits along the way, making you endlessly try to piece it all together. From the first little snippet of the novel that Evan Parker/Parker Evan submitted to his instructor, I was desperate to know more of that novel within the novel. Slowly, Korelitz reveals it all in such a clever manner and her multiple red herrings had me convinced each time. Totally enjoyable, thrilling and worthy of its hype."
318,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4021265-tad,Rating 1 out of 5,"I had to give up on this book at about the one-third mark. It was dreadfully slow and lacked any real tension. The narrator was especially hard to listen to. It seemed like they were concentrating so hard on enunciating every word that it sounded computer-generated and was filled with unnatural pauses. Speeding up the playback helped but did not improve the experience enough. I've seen some reviews suggesting the pace picks up in the latter half of the book, but glacial pacing through the first third is just too much. Unfortunately, I could not enjoy or finish this book."
319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5725102-renee,Rating 1 out of 5,"I had hopes based on the synopsis, but it fell flat fast. The writing was wordy, in fact, too wordy. For an example - the first main was given paragraphs to explain his three part name. I don't feel like I needed that in depth explanation for the middle name Finch that he gave to himself. The last name derived from a Jewish name. Who cares that much ? It held nothing in regards to the plot. Sadly, about 25% I gave up. The style and length was just overboard, in my opinion. DNF"

323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13850569-shikha-rawal,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book is written as a story in a story format meaning that there is the main story of the book and another story inside the main story. Jacob Finch Bonner is a writer or rather was a writer of a great novel, once upon a time. He was unable to produce books of the same stature as his first book and accordingly his writing career was non-existent of sorts (much like the author of this book). Until he comes across ‚Äúthe plot‚Äù which guarantees his successful return as a writer. Jacob, does not chance upon this great ‚Äúplot‚Äù but actually steals it and that‚Äôs the main premise of the story. You have to wade through the entire book to understand how he steals ‚Äúthis plot‚Äù and this stolen idea has grave repercussions on his own life, albeit the main story. As the story was predictable for me, it did not give me any thrill or cliff hangers feeling to at-last know why ‚Äúthe plot‚Äù had such grave consequences for him and who was actually behind this idea. The author of this book, herself brings up this point that in the world we live in today, no body has a copyright to a great idea and unluckily, the entire premise of the book is predicated on stealing ‚Äúthe plot‚Äù. It‚Äôs tough to digest that a great idea, even if stolen would make the author jump through so many hoops and give so much heartburn given that the author herself points out that a great idea cannot be copyrighted. Another issue I have with the writing is that if a thought can be communicated in a crisp and concise manner then there is no need to regurgitate the same thought in twenty different ways as musings of the writer. To my mind that is just lazing writing since you‚Äôre trying to fill up the pages in the book without much thought to the story moving forward or actually helping the narrative of your book. Another issue I have with the book is the main character of the book, namely Jacob Bonner, always seems to be lucky to get hold of the right people at the right time - this again I feel is laziness on the part of the author as the author should try and put some more context and colour on the people. Some books are so easy to read. This was definitely not one of them. I felt like giving up so many times cause either the author kept saying the same thing over and over again or was whining a ton but I stayed with it. Pick it up if you have nothing else to read!!! Because of all the above reasons, my rating for the book is 2 stars."
324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35905360-ric,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book had one of the most unique and original plots I‚Äôve ever read, and that‚Äôs saying a lot. Also, a book about books, authors, bookstores, or publishing is just going to resonate even more with me because I (obviously) love books and my job. Both of those things made it so fun to read, especially the interludes with the chapters of the book written inside of this one. I will say that the reveal at the end was entirely surprising, but the twist to lead up to that point absolutely was. And even so, the way that the ending was done was perfect, even guessing what happens it was still entertaining and jaw dropping. If I had more time I probably would‚Äôve finished it in one sitting. "
325,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109747161-mid-continent-public-library,No Rating,"Plot (noun)) = A sequence of events in a narrative, as in a novel. This novel's suspense quotient is thru the roof! A page-turner that grabs you from the first chapter and won't let you go until the breathtaking conclusion, one that you won't see coming. A story within a story where a jaded writer, Jake Bonner, finds a second shot at success in a whirlwind thriller that probes the nature of creative provenance and asks the question: Whose stories are we allowed to tell?When a student shares a story he is writing that he believes will be a best seller Jake can't get it out of his head. When years go by and he still has not seen it published he gets curious and starts hunting for his former student. Finding out that the student died ten years ago he decides to write the book himself. What could go wrong? It's the perfect plot!! *Reviewed by Janet from Camden Point*"

Sin embargo, la manera en la que habla sobre los retos a los que tienen que enfrentarse los escritores y las particularidades del oficio de la escritura es bastante rescatable."
329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104718635-christine-indorf,Rating 4 out of 5,Well I had mix feeling at first. I have to say right away I figured out the end. Usually that puts a book to a 3 star but I have to say they did the ending perfectly so I gave it a 4 star. I also hated the main character. Not happy with his writing life after hearing a great plot from a book he is jealous. Two years later and after finding out the man who had the great plot is dead he justify writing the book. As time goes on a person writes him and said he stole the idea of the book so he goes out to see who wrote this message and during this he finds out the truth! The book drags on when he is discovering the truth but I have to say the ending makes up for all is flaws. I do recommend this book. A good summer thriller. I did enjoy reading this book but it isn't one of the best thrillers I have read. So going in with this information I think you will enjoy it!!
