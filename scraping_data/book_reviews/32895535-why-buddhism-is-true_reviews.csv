0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14046996-roy-lotz,Rating 3 out of 5,"A far more accurate title for this book would be Why Mindfulness Meditation is Good. For as Wright—who does not consider himself a Buddhist—admits, he is not really here to talk about any form of traditional Buddhism. He does not even present a strictly “orthodox” view of any secular, Western variety of Buddhism. Instead, this is a rather selective interpretation of some Buddhist doctrines in the light of evolutionary psychology. Wright’s essential message is that the evolutionary process that shaped the human brain did not adequately program us for life in the modern world; and that mindfulness meditation can help to correct this bad programming. The first of these claims is fairly uncontroversial. To give an obvious example, our love of salt, beneficial when sodium was hard to come by in natural products, has become maladaptive in the modern world where salt is cheap and plentiful. Our emotions, too, can misfire nowadays. Caring deeply that people have a high opinion of you makes sense when you are, say, living in a small village full of people you know and interact with daily; but it makes little sense when you are surrounded by strangers on a bus.  This mismatch between our emotional setup and the newly complex social world is one reason for rampant stress and anxiety. Something like a job interview—trying to impress a perfect stranger to earn a livelihood—simply didn’t exist for our ancestors. This can also explain tribalism, which Wright sees as the most pressing danger of the modern world. It makes evolutionary sense to care deeply for oneself and one’s kin, with some close friends thrown in; and those who fall outside of this circle should, following evolutionary logic, be treated with suspicion—which explains why humans are so prone to dividing themselves into mutually antagonistic groups.  But how can mindfulness meditation help? Most obviously, it is a practice designed to give us some distance from our emotions. This is done by separating the feeling from its narrative. In daily life, for example, anger is never experienced “purely”; we always get angry about something; and the thought of this event is a huge component of its experience. But the meditator does her best to focus on the feeling itself, to examine its manifestation in her body and brain, while letting go of the corresponding narrative. Stripped of the provoking incident, the feeling itself ceases to be provocative; and the anger may even disappear completely. Explained in this way, mindfulness meditation is the mirror image of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). In CBT the anger is attacked from the opposite side: by focusing on the narrative and subjecting it to logical criticism. In my experience, at least, the things one tells oneself while angry rarely stand up to cool analysis. And when one ceases to believe in the thought, the feeling disappears. The efficacy of both mindfulness meditation and CBT, then, is based on the interdependence of feeling and thought. If separated—either by focusing on the feeling during meditation, or the thought through analysis—the emotion disappears. This, in a nutshell, is how mindfulness meditation can be therapeutic. But Wright wants to make a far more grandiose claim: that mindfulness meditation can reveal truths about the nature of mind, the world, and morality.  One of the central ideas of Buddhism is that of “emptiness”: that the enlightened meditator sees the world as empty of essential form. The first time I encountered this idea in a Buddhist text it made no sense to me; but Wright gives it an intriguing interpretation. Our brain, designed to survive, naturally assigns value to things in our environment based on how useful or harmful they are to us. These evaluations are, according to Wright’s theory, experienced as emotional reactions. I have quite warm and fuzzy feelings about my laptop, for example; and even the communal computers where I work evoke in me a comforting sense of familiarity and utility. These emotions, which are sometimes very tiny indeed, are what give experiential reality a sense of essence. The emotions, in other words, help us to quickly identify and use objects: I don’t have to closely examine the computers, for example, since the emotion brings their instrumental qualities quickly to my attention. The advantages of this are obvious to anyone in a hurry. Likewise, this emotional registering is equally advantageous in avoiding danger, since taking time to ponder a rattlesnake isn’t advisable.  But the downside is that we can look at the world quite narrowly, ignoring the sensuous qualities of objects in favor of an instrumental view. Visual art actively works against this tendency, I think, by creating images that thwart our normal registering system, thus prompting us into a sensuous examination of the work. Good paintings make us into children again, exploring the world without worrying about making use of things. Mindfulness meditation is supposed to engender this same attitude, not just with regards to a painting, but to everything. Stripped of these identifying emotional reactions, the world might indeed seem “empty”—empty of distinctions, though full of rich sensation. With objects, it is hard to see why this state of emptiness would be very desirable. (Also it should be said that this idea of micro-emotions serving as registers of essential distinctions is Wright’s interpretation of the psychological data, and is rather speculative.) But with regards to humans, this mindset might have its advantages. Instead of attributing essential qualities of good and bad to somebody we might see that their behavior can vary quite a bit depending on circumstances, and this can make us less judgmental and more forgiving. Wright also has a go at the traditional Buddhist idea that the self is a delusion. According to what we know about the brain, he says, there is no executive seat of consciousness. He cites the famous split-brain experiments, and others like it, to argue that consciousness is not the powerful decision-maker we once assumed, but is more like a publicity agent: making our actions seem more cogent to others. This is necessary because, underneath the apparent unity of conscious experience, there are several domain-specific “modules”—such as for sexual jealousy, romantic wooing, and so on—that fight amongst themselves in the brain for power and attention. Each module governs our behavior in different ways; and environmental stimuli determine which module is in control. Our consciousness gives a sense of continuity and coherence to this shifting control, which makes us look better in the eyes of our peers—or that’s how the theory goes, which Wright says is well-supported. In any case, the upshot of this theory still would not be that the self doesn’t exist; only that the self is more fragmented and less executive than we once supposed. Unfortunately, the book steeply declines in quality in the last few chapters—where Wright tackles the most mystical propositions of Buddhism—when the final stage of the no-self argument is given. This leads him into the following speculations: If our thoughts are generated by a variety of modules, which use emotion to get our attention; and if we can learn to dissociate ourselves from these emotions and see the world as “empty”; if, in short, we can reach a certain level of detachment from our thoughts and emotions: then, perhaps, we can see sensations arising in our body as equivalent to sensations arising from without. And maybe, too, this state of detachment will allow us to experience other people’s emotions as equivalent to our own, like how we feel pain from seeing a loved one in pain. In this case, can we not be said to have seen the true oneness of reality and the corresponding unreality of personal identity?  These lofty considerations aside, when I am struck by a car they better not take the driver to the emergency room; and when Robert Wright gets a book deal he would be upset if they gave me the money. My point is that this experience of oneness in no way undermines the reality of distinct personal identity, without which we could hardly go a day. And this state of perfect detachment is arguably, contra Wright, a far less realistic way of seeing things, since being genuinely unconcerned as to whom a pain belonged, for example, would make us unable to help. (Also in this way, contra Wright, it would make us obviously less moral.) More generally, I think Wright is wrong in insisting that meditation can help us to experience reality more “truly.” Admittedly, I know from experience that meditation can be a great aid to introspection and can allow us to deal with our emotions more effectively. But the notion that a meditative experience can allow us to see a metaphysical truth—the unreality of self or the oneness of the cosmos—I reject completely. An essentially private experience cannot confirm or deny anything, as Wright himself says earlier on. I also reject Wright’s claim that meditation can help us to see moral reality more clearly. By this he means that the detachment engendered by meditation can allow us to see every person as equally valuable rather than selfishly considering one’s own desires more important. Now, I do not doubt that meditation can make people calmer and even nicer. But detachment does not lead logically to any moral clarity. Detachment is just that—detachment, which means unconcern; and morality is impossible without concern. Indeed, it seems to me that an enlightened person would be even less likely to improve the world, since they can accept any situation with perfect equanimity. Granted, if everyone were perfectly enlightened there would be no reason to improve anything—but I believe the expression about hell freezing over applies here. Aside from the intellectual weakness of these later chapters, full as they are of vague hand-waving, the book has other flaws. I often got the sense that Wright was presenting the psychological evidence very selectively, emphasizing the studies and theories that accorded with his interpretations of Buddhism, without taking nearly enough time to give the contrasting views. On the other hand, he interprets the Buddhist doctrines quite freely—so in the end, when he says that modern science is confirming Buddhism, I wonder what is confirming what, exactly. And the writing, while usually quite clear, was too hokey and jokey for me. Last, I found his framing of meditation as a way to save humanity from destructive tribalism as both naïve and misguided. In brief, I think that we ought to try to create a society in which the selfish interests of the greatest number of people are aligned. Selfish attachment, while potentially narrow, need not be if these selves are in enmeshed in mutually beneficial relationships; and some amount of attachment, with its concomitant dissatisfactions, seems necessary for people to exert great effort in improving their station and thus changing our world. Encouraging people to become selflessly detached, on the other hand, besides being unrealistic, also strikes me as generally undesirable. For all the suffering caused by attachment—of which I am well aware—I am not convinced that life is better without it. As Orwell said: “Many people genuinely do not wish to be saints, and it is probable that some who achieve or aspire to sainthood have never felt much temptation to be human beings.”"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've read every book Wright's written and all have been fantastic. This is my favorite. It's the perfect book for the cultural moment we're in. Forget the title--it's misleading. The book is a nice primer on meditation and evolutionary theory with some helpful insights. Basically, our brains are not wired for peace and happiness--only to propel our genes forward. There's a yearning for more programmed into us and the only antidote is mindfulness meditation. I've read a ton of evolutionary theory and a bunch of buddhism lite, but this one is exactly the synthesis I've been waiting for (without knowing it). It changed the way I think about meditation and my thoughts and feelings. Read it and pass it along. We all need this book right now or we're going to nuke ourselves off the planet or otherwise destroy it through greed in no time. "
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u,Rating 4 out of 5,"“The problem with introspection is that it has no end.” ― Philip K. Dick For years I've told people I was a Zen Mormon. More as a way to squirm into the edges of LDS cosmology, and less because I was practicing anything really approaching a hybrid of Buddhism and Mormonism. But I've always been attracted to Buddhism, like many Westerners before me. I'm thinking of Herman Hesse, W. Somerset Maugham, Jack Kerouac, and Peter Matthiessen. I've always been attracted to the intersection of cultures, philosophies, etc. So, I guess it is natural for me to be attracted (if somewhat lazily) to Western Buddhism, Zen gardens, and the potential of mediation.I'm also a big, nerdy fan of Robert Wright. I've read most of his books. It is probably easier to just post the one book of his I haven't read, rather than list the ones I have.* I enjoy Wright's evolution from Evolutionary Psychology to Buddhist writings. I think the premise of Wright's book is mostly correct. There is something that evolution has burdoned us with, that meditation (specifically Mindfulness Meditation) and Buddhism can help us with. The books title, I should note here, IS a little off putting. I think Wright almost meant it as a joke (with a hook of truth). It comes across like some Mormon, Southern Baptist or Jehovah's Witness tract; a bit evangelical. But Wright is not just trying to convert the reader (and he's not exactly NOT trying to convert the reader either). He lays out pretty good arguments about how Evolutionary Psychology and behavioral psychology show (lots of caveats, obviously the mind is complex and not everyone agrees with everything) that a lot of our feelings, motives, choices are built on genetic coding which might actually make us unhappy, unhealthy, etc. The Buddhists seemed to have climbed that mountain before us. Wright seems less of a philosophical or religious Buddhist and more of a pragmatic Buddhist. I think his time studying how religion, the mind, behaviors, etc., have evolved over time has also provided him with ample evidence about how these traits that were evolved to help our more primitive selves reproduce, survive, etc., don't always help us in a modern age that includes HR departments, Facebook, politics, etc. Buddhism, Wright would argue, can help untangle some of these evolutionary knots. So? What does this book mean for me? Someone who calls himself (mostly in jest) a Zen Mormon who has spent exactly 10 minutes mediating in a half-assed way? Well, I'm thinking of hooking up with a local Buddhist/Meditation group and giving Mindful Mediation a try. I'm pretty chill, but I think mindfulness can only help. I'm also not above exploring truth beyond my own familiar cosmology. When I told my wife and kids of my plan, they did laugh however. My wife suggested meditation might not be easy for me, given my competitive nature.Wife: ""You can't win at meditation.""D8u: ""Sure you can, isn't enlightenment basically winning?""Daughter: ""Yeah Mom, the Buddha definitely won.""D8U: ""See?""My daughter, laughing, said the closest I've come to meditating was my nightly scalding bath, with headphones in my ears, a cold diet Dr. Pepper, and candy. She thinks anything that would help me unplug one or two of my sensory addictions might not be a bad thing. I agree. It is worth a shot.* I haven't read Three Scientists and Their Gods: Looking for Meaning in an Age of Information."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78485297-mario-the-lone-bookwolf,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a fact-based and serious book that uses brain science, evolutionary psychology/biology and sociobiology to prove each claimed assumption and maybe one of the best explanations of how and why mindfulness and a livelong training and evolution of meditation and self-reflection might be advisable. A few examples: Someone working hard and achieving amazing results after decades of training and exercising to become a leading expert, master, maybe even a prodigy, world elite. People bursting full of enthusiasm, charisma and happiness, spreading it as if it was a renewable energy source they could never run short of. A classical, stereotypical Buddhistic monk or a kung-fu master. A surgeon, soldier or emergency doctor, staying cool and focused for hours. Etc.They all have what all others are desperately searching for, control over their minds. Be it innate, epigenetic or just regular practice, guess what way could work for nearly everyone? By starting practicing right now and never stop being mindful again many of personal, unreachable seeming goals can become possible. But that´s just about controlling the mad monkey in one´s single brain.Where other books about the topic end, Wright begins to dissect the functioning of all aspects of a human mind and how a loss of objective serenity just always leads to problems, no matter if it is a family of 4 or a state of hundreds of millions or humankind. All those group dynamics, ego, being right or wrong, getting angry, sad, etc. were really fancy vehicles as long as we were nothing more than animals, but in highly developed civilizations, where uncontrolled emotions are no evolutionary advantage anymore, they just bring pain and sadness. Of course, it´s about the bad, negative emotions, not cutting love and joy out of one's soul.Wright has the idea of a new, real-life based Buddhism without focus on afterlife, reincarnation, heaven, hell, etc. and instead a basis on the philosophical and scientific ideas that help everyone to become a better human by integrating the knowledge of psychology and evolutionary biology/psychology at a purely scientific base without any faith or potential for extremism.Happiness and joy is a free choice and everyone can freely choose between it and neutral or pessimistic, but both the neurological and Buddhistic approach show that it might just hurt oneself. It is much healthier and makes one stronger, because we are social animals that are functioning better, be it as extroverted people lovers or as introverted stay at homers, when we enjoy what we do. It´s a shield against any harm and it´s an armor that is easy to wear and impossible to permeate, because if someone is cool about everything and takes everything negative, even provocations, positive, she/he is indestructible. In contrast, someone who protects her/himself by anger and hate, is permanently boiling her/himself in everything negative the biochemistry of the body can provide and is much easier to attack or be provoked to overreact.As long as we were even more primitive and hairier apes (how I love calling everyone a monkey, hey, chimpanzee over there, yea, looking at you, do you want a banana? Don´t forget, anger is your enemy, I am just helping you, don´t throw sh** at me please.) many of those mental dysfunctions were helpful. Find oneself great and think that everyone else is an idiot. Check. Prone to group dynamics, opportunism and hierarchies to build mighty tribes. Done. Building a conscience, ego and higher intelligence by repeatedly believing and thinking the same things to shape the wetware. Bingo. And then, well, it quickly escalated, because narcissistic, cognitive dissonant, psycho primates (ha, got you again!) are a true pain in the gluteus maximus for themselves, all other groups and those poor, innocent planet under their swift paws.A short utopia: Out of calm and mindful minds grow more when they reproduce and the more they get the more influence they have on the state and if everyone would be enlightened and realized how destructive ego and negative emotions are world peace and a sustainable economic system would come and, but wait, stop, dystopia just called, saying humans are humans. The sad end of the story.No, just joking, forget the misguided and deluded ones who aren´t guilty, just had no chance and are impossible to heal, focus on the next generation instead. With each kid, able to control her/his emotions, self-reflection, self-criticism, stay objective, believe nothing, stay evolving and adapting and always curious, you make Buddha laugh.And questioning and changing anything may bring us away from many self-destructive paths we are currently on as humankind, to realize that there may be the too objective, too easy and egoistic and wrong Buddhistic approach to say that there is no right and wrong, nothing matters, no true or false, the mind is empty, total objectivity is king, all is an illusion, etc. That´s a sophisticated way to say that one's own peace of mind and easy, stressless life is more important than to stay motivated, positive, neutral and engaged in both civil society and politics to make a change happen.Not all that seems bad is just evil and not all that seems good is pure gold, instead the wrong, destructive, dangerous and misleading ideas out of all ideas humans ever had, have to be eliminated because there is just a collective way in the middle of the road together, not with everyone walking angrily, sulky and offended as far at each side of this metaphorical entity that is our all lives. But all compromises have to be evidence-based, no soft science, no mumbo jumbo humanities, just real, hard-science based long term, reproducible studies, not funded by anyone interested in a certain outcome. This is also how this amazing author wrote a must-read book and how we as a society can overcome our animalistic roots, urges and instincts to something more worthy of the Latin name sapiens in the article description.

“Ultimately, happiness comes down to choosing between the discomfort of becoming aware of your mental afflictions and the discomfort of being ruled by them.”
True happiness is exceedingly hard to find in this life. And when I hit hard times I always find myself drawn to Buddhist teachings as a way to detach myself from my thoughts, feelings and desires in order to become mindful and live in the moment. Whilst not a miracle cure, the strongest benefit gained by Buddhist practice is the ability to gain perspective and understand that often it is our own reactions that cause us to suffer internally. The wisdom gained through achieving contentment with our life can lead to the emptiness Buddhist's strive for. But these are just words. Achieving them is an entirely different matter. This is what Wright discusses here, the philosophy of Buddhism and the truth and positiveness behind it. Because it is true if we can embrace it. If we can learn to live it everyday we can achieve some small sense of internal happiness. Initially this is all marginal and preoccupied with the self; however, once we learnt to transform the self we can transform the world and others around us.So I believe in the truth of Buddhism and this book provides a deep, stimulating and intellectual discussion behind exactly why the truth is such a potent one. __________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________"
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was a really compelling book for me - it made me think deeply about myself and the world and opened my eyes a bit too. It's no coincidence that multiple of my smarter friends have told me to read it!Meditation is a subject that is interesting to me because of how many smart/successful people that I've talked to or read about highly recommend it. I wanted to better understand it, but I didn't predict all the directions this book would take. One of the main interesting takeaways was how strongly the book ties the theory of natural selection with meditation. ""So if you ask the question “What kinds of perceptions and thoughts and feelings guide us through life each day?” the answer, at the most basic level, isn’t “The kinds of thoughts and feelings and perceptions that give us an accurate picture of reality.” No, at the most basic level the answer is “The kinds of thoughts and feelings and perceptions that helped our ancestors get genes into the next generation.""This makes sense, we evolved over millions of years according to an algorithm that simply said: the ones who live pass on their genes. This has a lot of implications however, the foremost being that our ancestors - the ones that passed their genes on to us - evolved to be particularly good at finding food, mating and having kids, being alert to and surviving various dangers, and being positive contributors of their tribe (as outcasts don't survive). They did NOT evolve to be ""happy"". ""Natural selection doesn’t “want” us to be happy, after all; it just “wants” us to be productive, in its narrow sense of productive. And the way to make us productive is to make the anticipation of pleasure very strong but the pleasure itself not very long-lasting.""This to me was a huge insight. I am constantly seeking new experiences, and am fortunate to have experienced many amazing things. But each thrill quickly fades and I find myself worrying about whatever is next remarkably quickly. To know that we were evolved that way on purpose - because our ancestors who killed a mammoth would only survive if they killed another one next week - is both fascinating and illuminating. This is why it is true that money doesn't make you happy, nor do successes in career. The book delved into our emotions around human relationships a lot, which I found very interesting. Because as much as I would love to say ""I don't care what others think of me"", it's simply not true. In fact, random encounters with people I don't know and will never see again - can bother me. Also, encounters with people I do know can worry me quite a lot too. So it's somewhat comforting to realize that we evolved to be this way. Interestingly, interactions with strangers is a newer thing to us and has likely added to our modern day stress. The book also talks a lot about essence, as many of us have impressions of others (eg nice, not nice, helpful, jerk, selfish, weird, etc) that aren't really ""accurate"" - they are just our perceptions, and by being aware of this, it can better help us interact with such people. ""We're designed by natural selection to care—and care a lot—about what other people think of us. During evolution, people who were liked, admired, and respected would have been more effective gene propagators than people who were the opposite. But in a hunter-gatherer village, your neighbors would have had a vast database on your behavior, so you’d be unlikely, on any given day, to do anything that radically revised their opinion of you, for better or worse. Social encounters wouldn’t typically have been high-pressure events.""So meditation can help us by recognizing that our mind is running these ""algorithms"", which come in the form of emotions, and cause us to ""worry"" about things, instead of focusing on being present in the moment. By observing which emotions and worries pop up, we can become more aware of them, and somewhat strangely - worry a lot less about them. ""The routine business of mindfulness—observing the world inside you and outside you with inordinate care—can do more than tone down troublesome feelings and enhance your sense of beauty. It can, in a slow, incremental, often uneven yet ultimately systematic way, transform your view of what’s really “out there” and what’s really “in here.” What begins as a modest pursuit—a way to relieve stress or anxiety, cool anger, or dial down self-loathing just a notch—can lead to profound realizations about the nature of things, and commensurately profound feelings of freedom and happiness. An essentially therapeutic endeavor can turn into a deeply philosophical and spiritual endeavor. This is the third virtue of mindfulness meditation: it offers a path to liberation from the Matrix.""The book had an interesting section on ""the self"". Most of us think there is an ""I"" inside of us that is calling the shots in our lives, or as the book calls it, our internal ""CEO"". But in Buddhism, one of the key concepts as you advance is you are supposed to learn that there is no self. But we aren't really in control of ourselves - if we were we wouldn't have all kinds of thoughts all day worrying about or contemplating all kinds of random things. The book proposes that what is really going on is that there are a number of ""modules"" (or algorithms as I prefer to think) that are competing for our attention. There is the ""mating"" module, the ""get food"" module, the ""look good socially"" module, etc. Any thought or anything we see or hear or smell can easily trigger the emotion that starts any of these modules. ""Buddhist thought and modern psychology converge on this point: in human life as it’s ordinarily lived, there is no one self, no conscious CEO, that runs the show; rather, there seem to be a series of selves that take turns running the show—and, in a sense, seizing control of the show. If the way they seize control of the show is through feelings, it stands to reason that one way to change the show is to change the role feelings play in everyday life. I’m not aware of a better way to do that than mindfulness meditation.""So, to summarize, humans suffer from ""dukkha"" or unsatisfactoriness, which means we have a constant craving or thirst or desire, which can't be quenched because if we attain our desire we will just have a new one. The only solution is to be mindful of the desires we have. To notice when we have a feeling, to examine the feeling, turn it over until you understand its root. By doing this, it loses its power over you. You can also start to recognize patterns in your thoughts if you do this a lot. The book says meditating 20min a day is a great start, but the difference between 30min a day and 50min is huge, as is the difference between 30min and 90min. But it also seems to imply that a weeklong retreat is likely also required if you really want to see benefits. ""You might say that the path of meditative progress consists largely of becoming aware of the causes impinging on you, aware of the way things manipulate you—and aware that a key link in that manipulation lies in the space where feelings can give rise to tanha, to a craving for pleasant feelings and an aversion to unpleasant feelings. This is the space where mindfulness can critically intervene.""This all leads to a question that is interesting to ponder but the book only touches lightly on, which is that: is the way we evolved the way we need to behave to be happy and thrive in modern times? The answer is likely not as humans over the past 1000 years have changed a lot - even the past 100 years. So how could we help a lot more people be aware of this and what impacts could that have? A good question!""There’s a lot to dislike about the world we’re born into. It’s a world in which, as the Buddha noted, our natural way of seeing, and of being, leads us to suffer and to inflict suffering on others. And it’s a world that, as we now know, was bound to be that way, given that life on this planet was created by natural selection. Still, it may also be a world in which metaphysical truth, moral truth, and happiness can align, and a world that, as you start to realize that alignment, appears more and more beautiful."""
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william2,Rating 2 out of 5,"I disagree with the author’s view of meditation as a study of one’s thought. But then there are so many schools of meditation… I’m primarily interested in the evolutionary psychology angle here, but have to sit through these pages that don’t entirely accord with my Soto Zen dharma. But as Shunryu Suzuki-roshi once said—read Zen Mind, Beginners Mind—there’s something to be gained from all schools of meditation, and we should seek those aspects of any dharma which strengthen our practice instead of seeking to tear down by way of a brittle Western-style critique, which, let’s face it, is little more than dogma-mindset or just plain envy masked by pedantic connoisseurship. The author goes through the many self-delusions evolution instills in us as a means of making our genes more viable in a hunter-gatherer society. These include our ability to generate fundamentally baseless feel good stories about ourselves as a means of instilling confidence in others; our tendency to convince ourselves that we are more valuable than the average team member. Our egocentric biases are aided and abetted by the way memory works. Those certain painful events get seared into our memories—perhaps so we can avoid repeating the mistakes that led to them—we are on balance more likely to remember events that reflect favorably on us than those that don’t. . . which presumably makes it easier to convince others that our story is true. (p. 84)We are in short a species of hustlers. No wonder the one percent is flourishing. (!) Overall the book is too colloquial, too chatty, to be genuinely engaging. I like the evolutionary biology angle but it’s buried among too much padding. Meh. Stopped reading at p. 109. The prose being dull as dishwater. (I say this not really knowing how or why dishwater is dull, just that the simile seems apposite.)"
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22908303-brian-bergstrom,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a truly remarkable, fantastic book. It is one of those rare volumes that will turn your head inside out and leave you seeing the world differently, not because he (or it) is extreme, but because reality is extreme; he is sewing together science and philosophy and offering readers a breathtaking tapestry for their consideration. Briefly, his argument is that our minds are populated by evolved psychological adaptations that were naturally selected for their adaptive utility, NOT for seeing the world objectively. And especially when it comes to our feelings and emotions, our minds often saddle us with perceptual and conceptual distortions that lead to unnecessary suffering. This state of affairs, as revealed by psychological science, aligns well with Buddhist renderings of the human predicament, and (even more remarkably) psychological science is also showing that the Buddhist prescription of mindfulness meditation can indeed help alleviate much of this suffering. Mindfulness meditation works as a kind of cognitive exercise (a kind of mental resistance training), that over time affords us distance from the tumultuous workings of our mind and allows us to see things more clearly (which often drains anxiety and anger of their motivational power) and helps foster our ability to chart where our mind goes next. Not only does mindful distance get us closer to the Truth (or at least further from delusion), but Wright argues that it can also bring us closer to moral truth, enhancing our capacity for responding in idealistically ethical ways. And that's just scratching the surface. The deeper details, duly contemplated, will leave readers enchanted (head often spinning, occasionally agitated). Robert Wright has always had a keen ability to integrate disparate ideas in science and philosophy (stepping back to view things in wider perspective than the original scientists whose work he builds upon) and this book is a gem that will not disappoint those who enjoyed his earlier books (e.g. The Moral Animal, Nonzero, The Evolution of God), especially his dry wit, everyday-guy accessibility, pragmatic reasoning, and clear writing. As a psychology professor who teaches courses in evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and psychology of religion, I'm in something of a unique position to review the work. Certainly I can say that Wright's command of the subject matter, ranging from evolutionary psychology to abstruse Buddhist philosophy, is excellent. (Experts in those fields will find details to quibble about, of course, but Wright does his homework and--to his credit--modestly concedes that his interpretations are his own best renderings. And they are good renderings.) I think everyone should read this wonderful and important book. I worry that many will be put off by the title alone. I worry that those conversant with the subtleties of Buddhist thought will not invest the time and effort to grapple with the subtleties of psychological science and evolutionary biology (and vice versa). It IS a book that, I think, requires more of a cognitive commitment from readers than others. But it will reward all who do. Whether readers come away in general agreement with Wright or not, I don't think it is possible to read the book and come away WITHOUT a better understanding of yourself and a better appreciation what it means to be human. That alone makes it an engine of insight.(Thank you to NetGalley for the advance review copy!)"
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,Rating 2 out of 5,"62nd book of 2017.I imagine the author at a diner party, demanding complete attention from those present, while he describes at length being at an intense macho meditation retreat in the Maine woods, having the unfortunate luck of sitting next to a fat flatulent person. Telling all present very seriously that he's not the sort of person who is OK with flatulence, especially from other people, especially if they are fat, but because of his very serious (but also very modest) attempts at mediation he was able to step-back from his intense hatred of the person sitting next to him, and was able to experience the beauty of each particular fart in turn, smelling different notes, and if not loving them, at least seeing their beauty for what they are. He also felt some sort of oneness with the farter next too him. Now he tells us how some super-meditator, that he (blush) could never be, was put in a brain scanner, and showed almost no brain response when smelling evil odours. Imagine that! Now throw in some random passage from either Buddhist scripture or some other pre-20th C source to make some sort of weak point. Now repeat for another +300 pages.I would have been much happier if it had either (1) been a serious attempt at accessing the science and philosophy of meditation and enlightenment; or (2) been offered a serious discussion of Buddhism. The book offers neither. It's a shame because I think the topic itself is worthy of a serious book."
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,Rating 4 out of 5,"The title is a bit misleading, in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way. This book is really about Wright wanting you to know why he thinks secular Buddhism makes sense, and why mindfulness meditation is good for you. Wright goes with the basic idea that suffering is caused by our desires, and that our desires are caused by our illusory perception of reality. Buddhist practice aims to bring people out of that state of delusion and suffering, but Wright wanted to know, very practically, how that works. How does keeping the mind still and counting your breath while sitting in front of a wall make things clearer? He uses evolutionary biology and neuropsychology to dig at that question, and I must say that he comes up with very interesting explanations.I have read plenty about the overlaps of Buddhism and psychology and physics, but the evolutionary biology is a new perspective I hadn’t dwelled on before, I found the information provided by Wright fascinating. Biology, after all, affects our behavior, and the way Wright connects it to the Teachings makes an awful lot of sense. As does the way he explains the role of our conscious mind and the way our emotions often end up taking the wheel.I liked the passages on fundamental attribution error, as this is something I try to remain very aware of; it goes back to the axiom of grandmotherly wisdom that you should be nice with everyone because you never know their story, and their rudeness might have nothing to do with you, but be part of a greater context you have no knowledge of. Cheesy, but nevertheless important to remember when faced with difficult people.This book is written in a very accessible, conversational tone, and quite relatable to anyone who first came across Buddhism in the Western world. To anyone who isn’t familiar with the practice and philosophy, it is a clear book on how it all works, but it doesn’t contain any sutras, or anything like that. This is really a purely practical work on how the mind and brain work to defuse harmful habits and behavior when we engage in regular meditation practice.There is no mysticism or superstition in this book, which I appreciate greatly, as it can be a really helpful resource even for the biggest skeptics. You don’t have to believe in anything supernatural to understand what Wright is saying, nor to understand how meditation works and its effects. I was practicing cognitive behavioral therapy, as recommended by a mental health professional, for a long time before I started practicing zazen; it has been a very important tool for dealing with anxiety, anger, self-confidence and abandonment issues, and when I started getting serious in my Zen practice, the parallels were quite obvious right away. But I was also aware that they had different goals: the first one was to help me function in my daily life without getting paralyzed by the tricks my mind was playing on me, and the second was about reaching a very different kind of clarity. While there are similarities between CBT and zazen, it’s crucial to remember that they do not have the same purpose. I am not 100% on board with blurring the lines between therapy and spiritual practices, even when they feel very similar – which is really the main bone I have to pick with this book. Mindfulness meditation is great tool, but Buddhism is not therapy and should not be sold as such.I can see how it could have felt very fluffy to some people, but I really think this was meant as an introduction to Buddhist ideas: there are plenty of other books with which one can deepen their understanding of Buddhist philosophy, practice and history. Anyone curious as to how their brain works while they meditate will find this interesting, if occasionally a bit irritating."
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13716226-murtaza,Rating 4 out of 5,"Growing up I always had a problem reading philosophy books, which often seemed to be written in a way that made them deliberately obtuse and inaccessible. For that reason I was really glad when I discovered the writing of Will Durant, an early 20th century writer who became popular for revisiting the arguments of the great philosophers in a clear and unpretentious language. It struck me as a very American thing to do, and I think with this book Robert Wright does much the same thing with Buddhist philosophy. The book traces through the core teachings of Buddhism and how they relate to evolutionary biology, which is Wright's area of expertise. Many of our ingrained yet seemingly irrational social behaviors (i.e. flying into a rage while driving, gorging on sweets past the point of hunger) are evolutionary remnants from the time we lived as hunter-gatherers or in small tribes. While once useful these behaviors and feelings are not actually good for us today living in a modern society, nor are they good for what evolutionary biology gears us towards: protecting and spreading our own genes. Since feelings are in some sense a means of getting us to do what's good for us, these behaviors and emotions could be said to correspond to what Buddhists call ""false"" feelings. This was an interesting hypothesis and is clearly a product of Wright's own expertise in this field. Much of the book also deals with Wright's own journey as a Buddhist, and he provides many helpful tips about both meditation and mindfulness. Among these are: 1) Consciously recognizing that your mind is wandering during meditation is actually a good thing, because it shows that you aware of the moment, which is the first step towards mindfulness. 2) Rather than you creating them, ""thoughts think themselves"" in your mind. They try to draw you into embracing them, but you are neither their slave or master. Once you become aware of that, it is easier to dismiss the ones you don't want or that are harmful to you. For example: frivolous thoughts during meditation or anxious ones when you have no reason to be unhappy.3) Accepting and analyzing your feelings or temptations about something are a means of truly ""owning"" them and then deciding whether you want to accept them or not (again, you don't have to).4) Declining to satisfy your temptations is a means of reducing their hold over you in the long term, as it gradually weakens the temptation-reward circuit in your brain.Wright also briefly discusses some of the more blissful and you could say ""supernatural"" experiences that he has had while on the Buddhist path. Like writing about how a piece of cake tastes to someone who has never eaten one, this is a difficult thing to do and in a sense it is not really possible to convey in text to someone a thing that they just have to experience. He seems to be aware of this and the book is written in full humility about the limitations of text. It was interesting to me to contrast some of the teachings of Sufism, which I'm more familiar with, with the ideas that animate Buddhist meditation. While there are areas of crossover and perhaps the ending point is similar, I think that they are genuinely different paths.All in all this was a rewarding book and the product of a deeply humane and thoughtful mind."
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1139239-michael-austin,Rating 4 out of 5,"Here are a two things about myself that shaped my reading of Why Buddhism Is TrueFirst, I like to play at evolutionary theory. I am not a scientist, but I did write a book on evolutionary psychology (Useful Fictions: Evolution, Anxiety, and the Origins of Literature) as it applies to the human attraction to literature, and, in writing this book, I read a lot of popular-science-type evolutionary psychology, including Robert Wright’s first three books. I liked them, and I thought that they were a notch above most of the genre. So, in a heavily qualified and limited way, I am a fan.Second, I have a deep intellectual attraction to Buddhism. I love reading about it and thinking about it. It makes sense to me on an intellectual level. I do not have a strong spiritual attraction to it, though, which is not surprising because I don’t really have a strong spiritual attraction to anything. I am religious, but not spiritual. I love religions, but I don’t go in for the spooky stuff. I see religion largely as a facilitator of deep human connections, which has always made Buddhism a bit problematic for me, as, in the orthodox varieties, human connections are among the things that you are supposed to not have attachments to because they only make you miserable. I don’t disagree. But I still want human attachments.Robert Wright’s view of Buddhism, then, is at the right level of abstraction for me. He is intellectualizing it too, as I would, and he dismisses most of the spooky stuff the beginning. In fact, he makes it clear that what he is really talking about in this book is not Buddhism as practiced in most Buddhist nations, but the sort of Westernized pseudo-Buddhism that goes in for yoga and mindfulness meditation but not for Bodhisattva vows and celibacy. He acknowledges that he is working from a very limited palette of Buddhism.So, how does he do? There are some terrific insights in the book. Two of them, I think, stand out for their clarity and usefulness. First, he observes that natural selection causes us to anticipate more pleasure in things like food, sex, and achievement than we will actually ever feel. We are supposed to keep wanting these things, but never to feel like we “have” them (or we will stop pursuing them), so we will always overestimate the happiness that they will bring us. This puts us on a vicious cycle of trying, and failing, to achieve happiness through mechanisms that are never going to bring it to us. This is an important observation in Buddhism, and, by showing that it has an evolutionary foundation, Wright makes it all the more compelling.The second key observation is that most of the things that motivate us can be described as illusions. What he is really talking about here is anxiety. Human beings are really good at worrying about stuff that is never going to happen, or, if it does happen, never going to be as bad as we think it is going to be. This is because natural selection does not care if we are happy. It only cares that we are surviving and reproducing. And high anxiety correlates strongly with survival. The theory here is that, if we run away from everything, we will eventually run away from something dangerous, and even if we run away from a thousand non-dangerous things, running away from the real dangerous thing just once will save our life and our genes. Understanding this has been key to my own psychological development. It is a known thing in evolutionary theory (usually called the “Smoke Detector Principle”). I encountered it in researching my own book, and it became the basis for the cognitive self-talk that brought me out of a period of crippling anxiety many years ago. I had never connected it to Buddhism before, but it makes sense. In both of these areas, Wright’s marriage of Buddhism and evolutionary psychology works. And it works in a way that makes the argument stronger. The Noble Truths of Buddhism really do have as scientific foundation. Desire leads to suffering. We are programmed to believe that things will make us happy, and we are programmed to overestimate the happiness they will bring us. So disappointment is inherent in desire. Similarly, we are motivated by anxiety, and we are programmed to feel a lot more anxiety than we need. So, in a very real sense, the things that make us anxious are “illusions.” Not all of Wright’s points of contact between evolutionary psychology and Buddhism work this well. He devotes two chapters, for example (Chapters 5 and 6) to defending the Buddhist principle that the self is, on some level, an illusion. To do this, he makes the same sorts of arguments that Daniel Dennett makes in Consciousness Explained : we tend to think of ourselves as a discrete and consistent phenomenon, we see our brain as the CEO of our being, we imagine ourselves sitting in a ‘Cartesian Theater’ watching a set of concrete actions and motives that we call “us.” These are defensible positions, but they have almost nothing to do with Buddhism, which sees the isolation of the self as the illusion, not the consistency of the self. (Hence the old joke about the Buddhist monk who orders a hot dog by saying “make me one with everything”). The idea of connectedness, or interbeing, gets fairly short shrift in Why Buddhism Is True. I find this problematic for two reasons. First, it seems to me to miss the whole point of why Buddhists say that the self is an illusion, and second, it drives the narrative further into the self (to try to understand what is really behind the illusion), whereas (I would argue) Buddhism forces the self into seeing more connections with everything else.I think that Wright misses a huge opportunity here to talk about the fact that evolution always occurs in an ecosystem that includes, in broadest terms, the entire universe. Things that happened worlds away affected human evolution. Everything that surrounds us created the context in which we evolved. And we affect the way that other things evolve. Even within societies, human beings are adapted to other human beings. There is a strong evolutionary basis here to talk about the interconnectedness of all living things as both a Buddhist principle and a biological fact. I would have found this more interesting than a rehasing of recent evolutionary theories about the non-existence of a Cartesian Theater.I also felt that, during the last half of the book, Wright overused the ""modular mind"" theory, or the idea, popular in evolutionary psychology, that our mind has a series of ""modules,"" or brain apps, that interact with each other to produce our thoughts and actions. We may have a ""get sex"" module, or a ""do things to be popular module,"" or a ""understand what other people are thinking"" module. This is not a generally accepted idea outside of Evopsych circles, and at best it is an extremely abstracted metaphor for what really goes on inside of our minds. I don't think that it supports all of the uses that Wright puts it to in explaining things like self-discipline, meditation, and the interplay between reason and emotions. And I don't really think it is necessary. It ends up getting in the way of his explanations more than it further supports them.But now I’m starting to quibble. Wright narrows the case that he is making and acknowledges up front that he is using a very specific version of Buddhism to tell equally specific stories about the evolution of human consciousness. He does this, and he is a good writer. He is funny and interesting, and he makes some good points about important things. I wanted the book to be more, and I was disappointed that it was not. But, according to Wright, we always want things to be more than they are and we are always disappointed that they are not. So it would be both ungenerous and unscientific to expect Wright himself to be any different.All of this said, I can conclude that, while I enjoyed Wright's book, it did not unseat my favorite Buddhism-and-Science mashup: The Monk and the Philosopher: A Father and Son Discuss the Meaning of Life. This is a dialogue between a father and a son. The son, Matthieu Ricard, is a former biologist who became a Buddhist monk. The father, Jean-François Revel, is a reasonably well-known philosopher and atheist who loves his son. Through a dialectical process, they arrive (and guide the reader to) a deep understanding and appreciation of Buddhism as both an intellectual and a spiritual phenomenon. It is a phenomenal read."

I LOVE self help books based on scientific and psychological research, ones that cite a lot of studies and academic papers. I HATE self help books based on the personal opinions and philosophical musings of the author. Based on reviews and descriptions of WHY BUDDHISM IS TRUE, I thought it would be the former, when it was in fact the latter.I also felt like the author only made about five main points that could have been summarized in a nice magazine editorial. Instead they took up an entire repetitive book. Bleh."
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,Rating 4 out of 5,"In book titles, the sub-title after the title is a popular but often unnecessary thing. In this case, it's necessary. Why Buddhism Is True is very much indeed about The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment. Especially the science. Or so it struck me, who at times grew impatient with the science aspect. Frankly, I was much more engaged by the Buddhism part of the book--Wright's experiences, chiefly, and his attempts (in Buddhism, there can be nothing but attempts) to explain the religion (which isn't a religion so much as a paradox).Speaking of, if you read this book, prepare for the paradoxical. Not even Buddhists can agree on Buddhism--and I mean Buddhists from the same branch (be it Mahayana or Theravada or Zen or whatever other sub-categories there might be... and there might very well be).But back to science, is it that important that Buddhism's precepts be ""proven"" by science or, more sketchily, by psychology (which, like Buddhism, can be pretty paradoxical itself)? Wright seems to think so. He is in argument mode here, out to show that the ""weird"" parts of Buddhism are a lot less weird than first glance would lead you to believe.Me, I'm not worried about such truck when it comes to religion philosophy. But I had no choice but to be here. Meaning: move over Siddhartha. Make room for Darwin. Lots of natural selection, because natural selection works against Buddhism which works against natural selection. And lots of talk of modules here, too. Good grief. Modules? Something to do with adopted behaviors. Somewhat like the lecture hall in Psych 101, I dozed a bit but kept hearing the word. Like a mantra, maybe. Om... module.Happily, Wright sees Buddhism-style thinking as the only hope for an increasingly hopeless world. He never mentions He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Neither the one in Washington nor the one in Korea, but both could use a healthy dose of meditation and soul-searching, if there be one to search:""...we're living in an age when information technologies make it easy for relatively small numbers of people bound by a common enmity to find each other, no matter where on earth they are, and then coordinate to deploy violence. Hatred, even when diffuse and far-flung, has increasingly lethal potential.""What causes all the hatred? At some level it's always the same thing: human beings operating under the influence of human brains whose design presupposed their specialness. That is, human beings operating under the influence of the reality-distortion fields that control us in many and subtle ways, convincing us that we and ours are in the right, that we are by nature good, and that, when we do the occasional bad thing, it's not a reflection of the 'real us'; whereas they and theirs aren't in the right and aren't by nature good, and when they do the occasional good thing, it's not a reflection of the 'real them.' And it doesn't help matters that these reality-distortion fields often magnify, even out-and-out fabricate, the threat posed by them and theirs.""So, yes, we need to reject the core evolutionary value of the specialness of self. Indeed there's probably never been a time in human history when this rejection was more vital.""The poisonous tribalism Wright sees Buddhism as an antidote for works not only from an international standpoint but from an intranational one. I mean you, red state and blue state where never the purple shall meet. So here's one science quote I did like that might apply:""[Einstein] said, if you want a deeper understanding of physics, you need to detach yourself from your particular perspective--from any particular perspective--and ask: Suppose I occupied no vantage point? Since I wouldn't be able to ask how fast things are moving relative to me, what exactly would it mean to ask how fast things are moving?""The answer, of course, is it would change the question entirely, just as Buddhism does. ""After all,"" Wright writes, ""without a perspective to serve, there would be no feelings in the first place.""Hoo, boy. Giving up feelings is a hard thing to do. Which is why you best get meditating. Another hard thing to do. But look at how far we've come taking the easy way out by ignoring self-awareness and catering to our desires. Kind of like the band playing on as the Titanic took on Atlantic, in its way."

The book served to be pretty enlightening , as it gave a solid overview of a secular, or ""naturalistic "" perspective of Buddhism - by showing how many psychological theories that are currently entertained by the scientific community have, all the while ,been accepted(albeit in a implicit sense... very implicit sense) by Buddhists for thousands of years . Well, at least some of them. He acknowledges that there are a ton of schools of thought that can be classified under the category of Buddhism - therefore drawing a universal understanding of all schools is kinda hard. Which, partially invalidates the universality of his thesis. But , I digresss. The book was pretty good as an introduction to some secular perspectives of Buddhism, some modern perspectives in psychology , and an ehhh intro to evo psych. yayIt is well complimented by wrights earlier book on evolutionary psychology, the moral animal ."

Bet tada prisimenu, kad pvz road rage - įsiūtis vairuojant yra tik vienas iš mano proto modulių, na tokių beveik kaip telefono apps’ų, įjungiančių ir tam tikrą emocinį režimą, kuris išsivystė dar pirmykštėje žmonijos stadijoje kaip vienas evoliucinių išlikimo mechanizmų. Maždaug taip. Bet pradėsiu nuo pradžių. ..Iš tikrųjų tai truputį pykstu dėl klaidinančio pavadinimo: nes ieškojau grynai dvasingos knygos; ir dėl to, kad toks pavadinimas gali atbaidyti dvasingumo nemėgstančius.

17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1662632-richard,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’d strongly recommend this for anyone curious about meditation, specifically the Buddhist Vipassanā “mindfulness” meditation that everyone and their dog is doing, attempting, or at least talking about.What Robert Wright provides is the very welcome examination of the scientific basis of the claims and practice. Wright is a journalist so deeply embedded in cognitive science that he has taught in the philosophy department at Princeton and the psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania. He has written several books on related topics, and taught a six-week Coursera online course on “Buddhism and Modern Psychology”, which was part of his preparation for writing this. Wright has also been meditating seriously for many years.So you could think of this as a mostly unbiased, non-spiritual defense of Buddhism. Unlike every other book on the topic out there, he doesn’t assert the Buddha was the enlightened one and genuflect; in fact, the concept of enlightenment comes in for some rough treatment before Wright concludes that the goal isn’t as important as the attempt to progress towards that somewhat amorphous objective.The early chapters provide the scientific basis; the later ones are about Wright’s philosophical examination of meditation — and frankly, those latter chapters got kind of repetitive and boring.But meditation is connected in multiple ways to current cognitive science. ■ The attempt of the meditator to take control of their own thought process is related to the gradual recognition of the default mode network, which is that part of your brain that is active when you’re daydreaming, or when distracting ideas come unbidden when you’re trying to focus, or even when you're trying to get to sleep. When you’re really focused on something, this network is usually quiet, but it gets in the way a lot. Meditation is an attempt to tame that. ■ The connection between thoughts and emotions is examined. There’s a strong case here that no thought can exist without being tied somehow to an emotion, which is why your subconscious “cares enough” about it to present the thought to your conscious self. This is consistent with recent work in identity-protective cognition, which tells us that we didn’t evolve the ability to think in order to be logical and rational, but to aggressively defend those emotionally-connected thoughts. Wright mentions tribal cognition several times, which is the social version of those identity-protective mental heuristics. I agree with Wright that tribalism can be highly caustic in modern society, and he believes that meditation is the best chance at saving the world. I’m doubtful, primarily because of free riders and the coordination problem, but his point is a good one otherwise. ■ He doesn’t explicitly refer to Daniel Kahneman’s System 1 and System 2 thinking modes, but the connection is obvious. Meditation is designed to take control of the automatic part of the fast, instinctive, and emotional System 1, and be capable of using the slower, deliberative, and logical System 2 whenever the practitioner desires. This also connects to the “elephant and rider” analogy in Jonathan Haidt’s excellent The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom. ■ And, as I noted, mindfulness meditation is now everywhere. In the August 29, 2017 episode of the excellent science podcast STEM-Talk, the hosts interview David Spiegel, a psychologist who is one of the nation’s foremost experts on hypnosis. I listen to that podcast because it dives deep into the science, but I really wasn’t surprised when the connection between hypnosis and meditation came up early on, and Dr. Spiegel noted that they work in related ways, and that people who are good at meditation tend to be good good subjects of hypnosis.If you’re interested in mindfulness meditation but need convincing that it isn’t just a bunch of mystical nonsense — or you’re just curious — then this is the only book out there.­"

19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've been interested in many of Robert Wright's other books, but this is the first one I've read. The title is misleading (and perhaps nonsensical?), but there's plenty of interesting reflection here on the benefits of mindfulness meditation, both in terms of personal health and wellbeing, and in better understanding the nature of self and the universe in ways consistent with what scientific discovery has revealed on those subjects. It is in THAT sense that Buddhism is ""true"", and Wright hastens to separate secular Buddhism from the metaphysical claims and figures (such as Mara, the demonic deceiver) that attend some strains of Buddhism. I feel it is strange to label any belief system as ""true"" or ""false"", terms better suited to describing individual claims.Wright shares his own stories from various retreats, personal experience, and discussions with sage practitioners. There's a LOT of repetition here, which can prove boring, but the book is punctuated by moments of profundity that could be collated into a much shorter work of greater impact. It didn't help that I was already convinced of the thesis, which is that a habit of introspection and contemplation offers many important benefits (and Buddhism has a long and impressive history of presenting the best methods for fueling that habit). Taking the time to inspect one's thoughts, to realize we are but temporary collections of atoms, and to see there is no self... directly improves one's grasp of reality and sense of humility. Adding a filter of detachment and examination of one's emotions provides an extra beat before reacting. This one habit allows a chance to assume the best in others, to put yourself in their shoes, and to reconsider passionate or angry responses that might prove ineffective.An expert on evolution and morality, Wright spends a lot of time exploring how natural selection has primed us with certain behaviors. He looks at many pre-programmed urges in turn, and demonstrates how they've been co-opted in ways that no longer improve our reproductive success, yet still rule our habits and interactions. Meditation can be a great tool for examining those motivations and resisting them where they are unhelpful. There are mentions here and there of brain studies that buttress these findings, though not as many as I might have expected.There are a lot of terms related to meditation practice: schools of thought and names of techniques that I must confess have not stayed in my head. Part of it is that I heard them pronounced on the audio book, but did not see how they are spelled. The other part is that I have a hard time engaging with these other-language terms because I fear I could only employ them superficially or incompletely. That's purely my fault - I can't blame the book for that. Throughout, Wright is self-deprecating and makes clear that his years of mindfulness study have only equipped him enough to be dangerous, but nods toward the findings of advanced practitioners. I'll admit a certain level of skepticism toward those claims, and the utility of such extensive withdrawal from society, but I can't fault those who have devoted years to internal searching. There are far more harmful things they could be doing, and the world could use a lot more introspection and awareness right now. Not less.I was about to give this three stars, but realized I was docking it mainly for the soporific narration in the audio book, which is how I consumed this. That was the longest 10 1/2 hours of my life, and I've done Scientology auditing. I had to frequently rewind to figure out where I'd left off before my mind had started wandering. Robert Wright would remind me to use that as an opportunity to examine my thoughts question the nature of the sensation of ""boredom""."
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is Robert Wright’s attempt to square the insights and outcomes of Buddhist practices and philosophy with evolutionary psychology. The book is confused and confusing at times. But that’s mostly because Buddhism is pretty confused and confusing when you press down hard on some of its key constructs.That being said. Write is honest about his areas of confusion and does a more than admirable job of exploring and resolving the dissonance over the course of the book. Ultimately, Write’s basic argument is pretty sound. In a nutshell: * Natural selection predisposed us language adapted chimps to feel perpetually anxious and dissatisfied.* This feature kept our ancestors alive and striving, but now we’re needlessly miserable pert near all the damn time for no good reason. * Buddhists noticed this a long time ago, and figured out some ways to reduce/eliminate that particular brand of suffering better know as ‘the human condition’ or Dukha in the parlance of Buddhism.* If you pay mindfull attention to your thinking and feeling processes enough, you begin to realize that the ego (self story) thing you/me/we identify with and tirelessly defend is actually just a bunch of psychological ‘smoke and mirrors’.* Furthermore, we should probably all practice meditation so we can progress beyond our evolutionarily programmed proclivities to reflexively compete, endlessly self promote and mindlessly consume.I can’t really argue with any of that. And overall, I loved this book."

For example it isn't about rebirth which is part of buddhist believes. In fact it is not about any of the religious aspects of Buddhism. It's about secular Buddhism, or Western Buddhism. The subtitle, The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment, is on the other hand completely right for it. This book is mostly about scientific research into meditation, and the authors own experience of it. That being said, I really like this book. Wright manages pretty well to go into what science has to say about meditation, and that is actually quite a lot. I can't say I'm an experienced meditator, but I've done enough that I can say this rings true to me. It didn't teach me anything new about how to meditate, but it does explain the effects of it quite well. On the whole I think Robert Wright is a good writer. He writes with this self-deprecating humor that I found quite likeable. I listened to the audiobook version of this through storytel, but I think I may buy the print book to read someday."

But I also did not like the framing. It tries to explain why buddhist practices (not buddhism itself as a religion or belief, like the title claims) are good for humans via evolutionary psychology. I have conflicted feelings about evopsych anyway, but what Wright does here is so superficial that it really doesn't offer us anything new. I mean, yeah, sure, meditation is good for you. But you don't need to read this book to know that."
25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,Rating 1 out of 5,"Wrong from the title onIgnore the blurbs, it’s still a bad bookThere are several reasons for that.First, IMO, Wright is overrated. I rated “The Evolution of God” as a one-star. This one had a chance to get lucky, even though it was starting minus 1 star due to the title alone. That title, and ding, along with puffery from too many others, though, cost it that chance to do better.Now, within specific reasons it’s a bad book.First, ev psych isn’t nearly as true as Wright claims. And, as I said in the review of “The Evolution of God” if you want to apply something like that to religion, try the evolutionary anthropology of Scott Atran or Pascal Boyer.Second, the Stephen Batchelor denatured, demetaphyticized “Buddhism” that Wright presents isn’t Buddhism. (Wright even backhandedly, and out of the side of his mouth, admits this in the first chapter.Third — or, if it is, then Unitarianism is just as much Christianity as is what Wright et al call “Buddhism.” And, it’s not.Fourth — If Unitarianism WERE that, yet, nobody writes a book called “Christianity is true” unless they’re a fundamentalist.That alone should show what’s wrong with the book.But BuJews like Sam Harris on one said, and BuGoys like Wright et al on the other, find millions of people who can still be conned this way.Fifth, it is possible, indeed, that Buddhist secularism has special mediation insights derived from its religious roots. It’s also possible Christianist secularism does, too. It’s also possible neo-Stoicism does, and derived from its original philosophical roots. Maybe self-hypnosis does, derived from original empirical results followed by trial-and-error fine tuning. Or that modern science does, and influenced by a Buddhist-derived general idea of mediation, but NOT by anything specific.(From what I know, there is indeed at least some degree of truth to all of the above. That’s from reading a new bio of Rorschach, on precursors to modern science; from some experience with self-hypnosis; from a philosopher friend who teaches neo-Stoicism counseling; and more. And, much of these things started happening before Batchelor, or precursors, started popularizing Buddhist-derived meditation ideas in the west.)Sixth, note my adjectives two paragraphs above. Non-metaphysicians within Unitarianism would practice Christianist secularism, not Christianity. (Not all Unitarians are non-metaphysical.)Wright seems to make the assumption that only Buddhism, among world religions, has unique insights that can be secularly distilled. Tosh. I haven’t even mentioned Taoist secularism. (Confucianism? I agree with many philosophers of religion that it’s a philosophy, not a religion.)None of this is to say that meditation is bad. I think it can be good, indeed, for reasons in the book and beyond. So, don’t feel discouraged if the meditation Wright derives from Buddhist secularism doesn’t float your boat.Seventh, Wright ignores the irony of people — selves — reporting on the idea that there is no self. This is part of a larger issue that certain Buddhist principles should be ineffable. Wright also ignores this connection to karma, vis-à-vis what is, and is not, reincarnated, and why the whole idea of karma is senseless at best and repulsive at worst if there is no “self” yet we have punishing karmic reincarnations based on actions of past selves.Of course, he ignores it in part by presenting Buddhist secularism as “true,” and as true without having to look at its religious and metaphysical background.In fairness, he does note that issues related to this are raised by “maverick” Buddhists.Eighth, Wright, like other BuJews and BuGoys ignores that real, actual Buddhism has its own version of fundamentalism, violence against other religions, etc. Take the 969 Movement, leading the attack against Muslim Rohingya in Burma.And, no, please no “no true Scotsman” claims that this is modern, and just one small offshoot. Before Buddhism in its Indian homeland went over the mountain to China and then was pushed out of India by a new, reformed Hinduism (Vedism or Brahamnism or similar are better terms for the main religion of India at the time of Siddhartha Gautama), Buddhists are documented as persecuting Jains.Beyond Buddhism, he gets things wrong elsewhere. That includes muddling emotions and instincts, which he does so baldly and badly. Finally, the title.Often, it may be an editor at a publishing house that chooses a title. In this case, I highly doubt it; I’m sure that’s Wright’s baby. It is provocative and smug as well as wrong.==If Wright were just offering up a book called “Buddhist-based meditation tools and ideas,” he might get another star. But, he earned the low rating."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5610133-sologdin,Rating 2 out of 5,"Cool, the interaction of philosophy of mind, buddhist theology, and recent neuroscience. I can see a number of consistencies between leftist ideas of how the mind works and buddhist conceptions, such as non-self and emptiness doctrines, the notion that desire is separate from the desiring ego, both anterior and superior to it, and how conduct is often based on irrational or pre-rational impulses. This is all worthy of severity.Less cool, the evopsych insistence on certain hobbesian assumptions. I don't see how these ideas are necessary to the argument; it is almost as though certain rightwing ideas are being smuggled in through the trapdoor. The normal method for this sort of smuggling is to state, unequivocally, that ""human nature includes [rightwing idea],"" even though this statement is controversial insofar as such ""[rightwing idea]"" need not be a cultural universal, requires some amount of cynicism to identify at all, and, at best, may apply merely to a fragment of human persons, as a matter of history rather than genetics. Then it is stated, again without any evidence, that this ""[rightwing idea]"" must be because evolution needed it (one major problem is the rhetoric in this book that evolution ""designed"" or ""wanted"" or ""intended"" a result, as though it were a person with a telos--this just theologizes something that need not be and should not be theologized)--a dreadfully overt post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. An attempted 'proof' is then adduced from an unknowable prehistoric evolutionary record in the form of bogus inferences drawn about what ancient proto-humans must have done or thought, as though there could ever be any falsifiable claims made about such things. Often support for these bogus inferences is drawn from the behavior of present day monkeys, which are both not part of our evolutionary history and are, ahem, present day, rather than prehistoric ancient. At every step, the inferences are ludicrous, the evidence lacking, the rightwing politics naked. All that said, even if there were airtight authority for this sort of argument to establish that such and such simplistic rightwing mental characteristic were 'natural,' that doesn't get us very far for the precise reason that this is about evolution, in which doctrine genetic change is in on the ground floor: 'nature' is always in motion, and reasoning from the present moment about prehistoric behaviors, in either direction, is not only unwarranted but unclear as to what the purpose actually might be. That is, things that are natural now need not have been natural then; and, in what absolutely crushes the dumb inferences aforesaid, things that were natural for troglodytic ape creatures need not be natural for us any longer--so those assumptions about what cave-dwelling proto-chimps thought and did when they were eating each other and climbing on giant fungi and trying to invent the opposable thumb are completely irrelevant when examining what we are doing. Excise all the evopsych posturing, and there's some great writing here about the buddhist philosophy of mind, which is intellectually worthy and has practical value for one's own aesthetic management."
27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2986010-francisco,Rating 5 out of 5,"If I meditated half as much as I read books about meditation it is very possible that I’d be a notch or two from enlightenment by now! But in my own weak defense, I will say that when the writing is good, as it undoubtedly is in this book, reading about the science, philosophy and psychology behind the Buddhist Vipassana tradition of meditation is . . . well, more fun. It would be tempting to lump this book about mindfulness as yet another attempt to capitalize on the current mindfulness vogue. But Wright’s book, although delightful to read, is intelligent and care-fully written and it doesn’t take long to detect the act of generosity that motivated its writing. The book seeks to have the same effect on your mind as mindfulness meditation: it will help you see your world a little more clearly, a little less clouded by egocentric delusions – yours and others. And that is not a bad thing. It was helpful to me to see how the findings of evolutionary psychology shed light on the question that comes up for all of us now and then: where the hell did that thought come from? It is good to know that my particular desire to strangle the living daylights out of someone is a vestige of a brain whose primary function was keeping me alive and keeping my genes traveling on into the future. Or that the nagging restlessness for some kind of specialness comes from when social status was needed to survive. But do I really need to give in to that kind of hunger now? Especially when to be special means that others aren’t? What the book did is to direct my attention for some three-hundred pages to feelings and thoughts I often think of mine but need not do so. I can observe them, and the observation diminishes their power. You can say that this is a small step toward liberation – a small step that has good effects for me and for the rage-filled world I live in. It is in this sense that Wright believes Buddhism to be true: that it accurately describes the faulty seeing that is happening inside of us, the suffering caused by the lack of clarity, and a way to ease the pain. The Buddhist notions of “no-self” and “emptiness” are not metaphysical doctrines to be intellectually examined. They are existential facts to be experienced. The beauty of this book is that thanks to it I could see how even a tiny movement toward no-self and emptiness, a tiny experience of their truth, could help bring peace to my world."
28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3429191-mg,Rating 5 out of 5,"I was a huge fan of Wright's EVOLUTION OF GOD where he tracked the progress in humanity's idea of God from an evolutionary paradigm. That is why I was surprised by his new book: In what sense did he mean Buddhism is ""true""? Well, he is still a naturalist but he has discovered that Buddhism has done the best job of describing the human problem and how to transcend our natural states and live happier, more peaceful lives--namely, through the practice of meditation. He even has some eschatological urgency to his mission since he thinks the forces of tribalization might end humanity's prospects for future thriving and so the best prospects for becoming nontribal is through becoming mindful souls who can transcend our fears and anxieties. Also, Wright's Buddhism is itself nontribal in that he describes the practice in terms of science and psychology and so requires no religious attachment in order to benefit from these spiritual exercises. As a Christian, I see no problem in fully embracing his insights and recommendations for meditating and becoming mindful. It simply reinforces the idea that spiritual growth requires deep self-knowledge and reflection, and too many of us treat these as optional."

30,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've given this 5 stars because it is the first book that I have come across that so neatly and persuasively links together the big ideas of buddhist thought and modern understanding of psychology and neuroscience. I've read great books that focus extensively on Buddhist logic with examples peppered throughout of corroboration with modern neuroscience (Rodney Smith's ""Stepping Out of Self-Deception: The Buddha's Liberating Teaching of No-Self) or books that deconstruct Buddhist ideas using a rigorous empirical approach (Stephen Batchelor's ""Alone With Others"") or books about neuroscience that implicitly underline specific ideas within Buddhism (Robert Kurzban's ""Why Everyone Else is a Hypocrite: Evolution and the Modular Mind"") but nothing that is (at least to my knowledge) as single-minded in the synthesis of both fields as this new book by Robert Wright. So in that sense, it is an important book in my view. The idea underpinning the book is that feelings have been utilized by natural selection as levers in which to push and pull us towards its ends (genetic proliferation), either towards things that are 'good' for us or away from things that are 'bad' for us, and that mindfulness meditation can help loosen the grip that these feelings have on us. It goes into the myriad ways in which these feelings give us inaccurate perceptions of the world and by extension guide us in ways that make us suffer, and offers real world experimental counterparts that give a clearer picture. For example, the tendency to anticipate a much more enduring sense of satisfaction from the attainment of goals than what actually occurs upon attainment of the goal is presented alongside a study of dopamine generation in primates where much more dopamine was produced in anticipation of fruit juice (association of a light being turned on with receiving juice) than when the juice was actually given to them. It makes sense from natural selection's perspective to program this sort of illusion into us, as resources need to be acquired to keep the gene-vehicle running and if what is 'out there' always seems better to us than what we already have, then we will try to keep acquiring new things. The 'good' feeling of of anticipation is a lever used to push us towards a new perceived resource, and the 'bad' feeling of dissatisfaction upon attainment is to keep us on the hedonic treadmill. This idea of craving leading to suffering is right in line with buddhist doctrines, as Wright lays out. And more importantly the teaching that mindfulness meditation can be effective in getting distance from your feelings and therefore more freedom in choosing which, if any, to follow. It seems that simply learning to focus on feelings themselves can dissolve their power in some fundamental way. As if our very ignorance of their presence or the circumstances in which they manifest is a core component that lets the levers do their work.There are numerous examples in the book that go into different aspects of buddhist doctrines and seamlessly ties them to current findings. The feeling certain things in the world are imbued with a particular essence is another delusion that is is dealt with at length with experimental examples (among others: expensive wine labels giving a ""good essence"" to wine 'experts' in comparison to an identical wine sans label) and compared to buddhist ideas about emptiness. The stories we attach to things, and the accompanying feelings, drastically affect our judgment.Outside of just experimental examples he goes into some detail with brain scans and which areas of the brain are activated for which impulses, and so on. It all helps to give a backbone to the arguments presented and make them altogether unassailable or at least very difficult to deny.Perhaps the most powerful section of the book is the area about the modular view of the mind. The buddhist doctrine of no-self is perhaps one the most difficult to apprehend and integrate into practice and Mr. Wright meticulously details the history of the teaching as well as the nuts and bolts of it. He also expounds about how current neuroscience supports the claim, specifically the landmark 'Split-Brain Experiment' which casts serious doubt as to whether an ""I"" exists as perceived and suggests that the sense of self is, to borrow the analogy, more of a Public Representative than a CEO.Wright intersperses the science and the rigorous appraisal of doctrine with his own experiential anecdotes of meditation and the evolution of his relationship with his feelings. The book is both parts descriptive and prescriptive in how a clearer relationship with our feelings can lead us to greater moral truth (dispelling the myth of our specialness in relation to others, for one). The prescriptive part may turn some people off, but I found it to be compelling and inspiring. There is a whole transcendent aspect of rising above natural selection's aims that permeates the book, and a call to arms using mindfulness as an entry point. The world is in a sorry state, and as effective as evolution has been to get us to this point of global integration, it now threatens to overwhelm. Higher cognizance of our situation is needed, and especially the delusions we operate under. We have to get distance from our feelings first, which is natural selection's primary tool for fostering delusion, and as Wright forcefully demonstrates mindfulness is a direct path to doing so. As liberating as the prospect of having a more objective relationship with your feelings and the world around you may seem, it can be hard to catalyze motivation without convincing evidence. Robert Wright's book offers such evidence and is an important dissemination of the 'radical' ideas of buddhism and modern neuroscience and what they tell us about our condition and how they can help us overturn our creator."

Like many words about religion and ideology with thousands of years' history, Buddhism is a loaded word, especially for someone from the East. During my upbringing, I have unavoidably heard enough stories about greedy monks and shady monasteries, witnessed numerous superstitions in the name of Buddhism in day to day practice. As to Buddhism philosophy (mostly Zen Buddhism), it was incomprehensible and impractical to me. Statements such as:-- Life is an illusion (but why you are still alive?)-- Do good things so you will be rewarded in your next life (but what about this life? Plus I don't believe in reincarnation)-- All creatures on earth are equal (what does that really mean? Does everybody have to cut off their arm to feed hungry eagles? Of course myself and my family are more important than other people, to me anyway)-- Let go all your desires (If I desire nothing, what's the point of living?)-- Let go your hatred (so must I forgive people who do me wrong? Must I continue to suffer the pain others inflict on me?) -- The thing (lamp, dust, flower, etc...) in front of you does not exist except in your mind (seriously? Are you insane?)Robert Wright, who studied evolution psychology in university and has taught philosophy and psychology, is an excellent writer who writes in the language of science and reason. Buddhism in his book, as the writer scoped Buddhism in ""A Note to Readers"" at the beginning of the book, only refers to ""Western Buddhism"", an atheistic version deprived of supernatural elements (such as reincarnation) and deities (such as the statue who might grant you your wishes if you offer her joysticks and pray really hard), close to monks (such as Tibetan Buddhism monks who meditate) than lay people (such as my older relatives), and it includes meditation and Buddhism philosophy (from Siddhartha Gautama’s teaching to Tibetan Buddhism tradition). Why Buddhism is True is a mix of evolution psychology, intellectual explanation of certain Buddhism concepts and why they are in sync with evolution psychology, and the author’s personal meditation experience. Buddhism described in the book speaks to me much clearer than any other Buddhism. There are 16 chapters. If you don’t have time and if you are really curious about what he means by “Buddhism is true”, you can read the appendix: A List of Buddhist Truths, which is an excellent summary of the coherence between Buddhism concepts and modern science, namely evolution, psychology and neuroscience. Here is a list of my takeaways:1. Based on Darwinian evolution, we are gene propagation machines “designed” (blindly) by natural selection. Natural selection does not want us to be happy, but productive, hence happiness by design is evaporative. This is what Buddha said long before neuroscientists of 20th century discovered the hedonic treadmill. 2. “Ultimately, happiness comes down to choosing between the discomfort of becoming aware of your mental afflictions and the discomfort of being ruled by them.” ― Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche3. The purpose of feelings is to help us to survive and reproduce. They are not designed to be accurate, and becoming even less in modern world. When feelings can not be accurately relied upon to guide our decisions, they become “false”. 4. “No-self” (or some interpretation of it) in Buddhism echos findings in neuroscience and psychology regarding consciousness, decision making and cognitive fallacies. The atuhor draws heavily on the notion of Modularity of Mind. Your conscious self is not the CEO who controls the enterprise of you, rather, it’s the Speaker of the House who announces the module that has the popular votes. Mindfulness meditation is the way to help your conscious self to get a clearer view of your modular mind, therefore to give nudges to the module that better suitable for the job.5. “Formless” or “emptiness”: No, it doesn’t mean the physical world does not exist. Rather, the “meaning” (the essence, the feelings and judgement that comes with feelings) of the physical world is what we, sentient beings, impose upon. These feelings and judgements do not exist in the physical world. I don’t think I full understand or agree with arguments on this topic, however, as someone who always admires the holistic world view, who try to view the world outside my self-entered, anthropocentric box, I incline to believe that the perceptual boundary between oneself and other human beings, between humans and other creatures, are not as clear and fixed as our intuition has told us.6. Nirvana: again, the author refers to the “naturalistic” side of Nirvana, ""not the liberation from perpetual rebirth, a liberation that will fully kick in at the end of this life cycle, but the liberation in here and now, liberation from the suffering Tanya brings—liberation from the cravings to capture pleasant feelings and escape unpleasant feelings, liberation from the persistent desire from things to e different than they are. "". On meditation: 1. Meditation, why and how they work. Two types of meditation: concentration meditation and mindfulness meditation. During mindfulness meditation, your DMN (Default Mode Network) in your brain quiets down therefore you may reach a sense of deep peace. Meditation is also the only way to experience “No-self” and “Formless”. 2. Intense meditation retreat is like extreme mental sports, an opportunity for you to engage a deep contact of innermost thoughts. Like physical sports, it may have side affects. This is an honest statement that reminds me an article about an unguided meditator who bought up childhood trauma through meditation but unable to deal with it.3. The author admits meditation practice needs a moral compass, but he does not elaborate the set of moral rules provided by Buddhism. I don’t mind such, because morality is not an religious invention, certainly it does not only belong to Buddhism.4. The author gives an answer to one question of meditation puzzled me for a long time: “Mindfulness meditation is often taught of as warm and fuzzy and, in a way, anti-rational. It is said to be about “getting in touch with your feelings” and “not making judgements”. And, yes, it does involve those things. It can let you experience your feelings—anger, love, sorry, joy—with new sensitivity, seeing their texture, even feeling their texture, as never before. And the reason this is possible is that you are, in a sense, not making judgements—that is, you are not mindlessly labeling your feelings ad bad or good, not feeling from them or rushing to embrace them. So you can stay close to them yet not be lost in them; you can pay attention to what they actually feel like. Still, you do this not in order to abandon your rational faculties but rather to engage them: you can now subject your feelings to a kind of reasoned analysis that will let you judiciously decide which ones are good building lights. So what “not making judgements” ultimately means not letting your feelings make judgements for you. And what “getting in touch with your feelings” ultimately means not being so oblivious to them that you get pushed around by them. I am skeptical about the last chapter, Meditation and the Unseen Order. Tribalism is a part of human psyche designed (again) by natural selection. However, in today’s world where globalization has made mankind a single interconnected network, and catastrophic climate change is closer than ever, to be continuously ruled by psychological tribalism will likely lead us to our collective death. The author therefore raises the possibility of “cognitive revolution”, whereby mindfulness mediation is somehow applied by all of us (or applied upon most of us?) and our collective psychological makeup gets revolutionized. The idea reads too much like a science fiction. No one knows how such a revolution can be achieved. And, please don't suggest to put LSD in water supply!"

35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,Rating 2 out of 5,"A bit of an extended throat-clearing before I explain rating a book by an author who I hold in very high esteem with a measly 2 stars:1) I absolutely was enthralled with Robert Wright's, ""The Moral Animal,"" and I think any animal wishing to understand morality should read it.2) I am not a Buddhist but I have studied meditation extensively and read nearly all of the Buddha's writings, a particular treat was the Glenn Wallis edition of The Dhammapada.3) Though a skeptic myself, I enjoy engaging with arguments for various faiths especially when presented by scholars such as Wright.Unfortunately, he very quickly - I'm talking on page one of the intro - explicitly states that he is not going to try to prove that Buddhism is true. Normally it's considered picking the low-hanging fruit to harp on the title but since Wright states several times that he himself chose the title I consider it fair game. What Wright is trying to prove is that a secular form of Vipassana meditation can have positive effects on your world-view and psychological make-up, without any of the supernatural baggage that comes along with it. Also, towards the end of the work, he admits and explains that he isn't a Buddhist and isn't seeking genuine enlightenment (""genuine"" here meaning applicable to religious practice of Buddhism, not secular meditation). Hopefully you can see an issue with this...His argument centers around similarities between suggestions from Buddhist teachings on the mind and recent modular theories of psychology, or more accurately represented, ""domain-specific psychological mechanisms."" These connections are mostly tenuous at best and a crash-course through Hume's philosophy of emotions is embarrassingly weak and unnecessary. If you have access to the book I would recommend skipping right to the Appendix as here he spells out in great clarity what he means with several terms relating to Buddhism as a religion that he is using in a secular context throughout the preceding 300 pages. Also it contains a cogent summary of his position, unsupported as it is: ""We are animals are created by natural selection. Natural selection built into our brains the tendencies that early Buddhist thinkers did a pretty amazing job of sizing up, given the meager scientific resources at their disposal. Now, in light of the modern understanding of natural selections and modern understanding of the human brain that natural selection produced, we can provide a new kind of defense of this sizing up.""In my opinion this isn't even close to meeting any conceivable standard of proof or even argument for the book's title, Why Buddhism is True. Sadly I think this is one to be ignored, read his paradigm shifting work of evolutionary psychology, ""The Moral Animal."""
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/874936-james-madsen,Rating 5 out of 5,"An entirely different type of book on secular Buddhism! First of all, about the misleading title: Robert Wright explains in his prefatory note to readers and then in Appendix A why he chose it. He had good reasons. But this is *not* a book trying to prove that the esoteric religious claims of Buddhism (e.g., reincarnation, karma) are ""true"" in the sense that they reflect the way that things really are. Wright is clearly and unambiguously not a ""religious"" Buddhist. (""I don't believe in reincarnation or related notions of karma, and I don't bow before the statue of the Buddha upon entering the meditation hall, much less pray to him or to any Buddhist deities. Calling myself a Buddhist, it seems to me, would almost be disrespectful to the many Buddhists, in Asia and elsewhere, who inherited and sustain a rich and beautiful religious tradition."") He's not into trying to make you into a Buddhist (even a secular Buddhist, which is how one would categorize him) or a Vipassanā meditator, although he clearly thinks that it would help us as individuals and as a global organism to practice mindfulness meditation for its practical virtues and to investigate Vipassanā meditation as a portal to a deeper, clearer view of reality.Instead, in this book, Wright uses evolutionary biology and psychology (he has taught not only in the psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania but also in the religion department at Princeton University, where he created the online course ""Buddhism and Modern Psychology"") to show that the core concepts of a naturalistic or secular Buddhism are not only consonant with but also buttressed by what we have come to know about how we evolved. As a reader who majored in zoology before going to medical school and who became fascinated by evolutionary biology (and evolutionary medicine), I was hooked early on.""Why Buddhism Is True"" could have been far more abstruse and ponderous; that it attacks difficult subjects and sometimes subtle arguments head on while still engaging the reader is largely because of Wright's precise but accessible, even conversational, style: he could just as well be talking with you at a party (I can just imagine his classes!). Nevertheless, this book goes deep into the rabbit hole and doesn't shy away from attacking subjects that require concentration and at times probably several focal rereads (not to mention consultation of the useful footnotes sprinkled throughout the text).But once you've taken the red pill and seen how natural selection equips us to live in its own Matrix of maximizing possibilities for the spread of our genes, you can see how evolution-generated feelings-based misperceptions and misinterpretations of the worlds inside and outside us contribute to our built-in resistance to seeing things as they truly are. You can see how the modern concept of the mind as a collection of competing modules without a permanent CEO function is one way (there are others, explained in the book) of relating to what Buddhists have called not-self or no-self. You can see how biologically engineered feelings can often contribute to evolutionary fitness but can also backfire, especially when their effects on our thinking are unrecognized and unresisted. You can understand how the ""fundamental attribution error"" contributes to our incorrectly assigning what Buddhists would call ""essence"" to ourselves and others, and how dangerous that can be. (""War offers a good example of how essence can spread from one level to another. You start out with the idea that a nation's leader is irrevocably bad. From this you move to the idea that an entire nation--the nation of Iraq or Germany or Japan--is your enemy. This then translates into the idea that all the soldiers of that country--or even all the *people* in that country--are essentially bad. And if people are bad, that means you can kill them without the sting of conscience. The United State dropped atomic bombs on two Japanese cities--cities, not military bases--and drew virtually no protests from Americans."" For a longer passage, one more relevant to current political tribalism than to wars per se, see my asterisked footnote [*] at the end of this review.) You can appreciate, in an insight that echoes David Foster Wallace's ""This Is Water,"" the affective and cognitive distortions that convince us, without our ever really thinking consciously about it, that we are special, not only the stars of our own life stories but also somehow deserving of more respect and attention than are others. And you can learn (mostly from personal anecdotes) how mindfulness meditation might help release us from the Matrix and what the experience of that kind of meditation can feel like.For it's crucial to realize that getting a grip on the genesis of the problems arising from our often incorrect perceptions and feelings and thoughts is only one step. Wright's professed reason for writing this particular treatise was to confront what is arguably the most dangerous moral crisis of our time: tribalism. His is an engaged secular Buddhism, one that doesn't retreat into meditative equanimity and withdrawal from the world at the expense of speaking out and acting when necessary. Speaking of those caught in the grip of evolutionary forces that reinforce tribalism, he writes, ""The question is whether I can get far enough down the path to conduct my ideological conflict with these people wisely and truthfully, which in turn means viewing them more objectively and, in a sense, more generously than I'm naturally inclined to do. . . [I]t would be tragic, to say the least, if after billions of years of arduous effort on the part of organic life, effort that has gotten us to a global community of minds, we let the natural distortions in these minds blow the whole thing apart. It would be all the more tragic in light of the fact that these distortions are now a scientific fact and that we have ways of correcting them, including, though not confined to, meditative practice.""Whether you're a traditional or a secular Buddhist or someone grounded in science, I would expect you to find this marriage of naturalistic Buddhist thought and modern science intriguing and enlightening (well, with a lower-case ""e""). And because of Wright's gift for teaching and writing with clarity and humor and unflinching honesty regarding his own little stumbles and partial successes along the way, you'll hopefully find the journey as delightful as I did.At the very end of the book, he addresses, almost as an aside, the observation, inimical both to certain lines of Buddhist thought and also to evolutionary psychology (he explains why in the text), that one of the consequences of meditation is a seemingly natural relaxation into a deep appreciation for beauty. And he concludes with this: ""There's a lot to dislike about the world we're born into. It's a world in which, as the Buddha noted, our natural way of seeing, and of being, leads us to suffer and to inflict suffering on others. And it's a world that, as we now know, was bound to be that way, given that life on this planet was created by natural selection. Still, it may also be a world in which metaphysical truth, moral truth, and happiness can align, and a world that, as you start to realize that alignment, appears more and more beautiful. If so, this hidden order--an order that seems to lie at a level deeper than natural selection itself--is something to marvel at. And it's something I'm increasingly thankful for.""As much as I enjoy and appreciate what Stephen Batchelor and others have written about secular Buddhism, this is my favorite book on the subject so far. My highest recommendation!*[the passage that I mentioned that I'd put at the end of my review, for those who might be interested]"". . . Natural selection designed parts of the human mind specifically to steer us through conflicts--conflicts between individuals and conflicts between groups. Some of our mental machinery is exquisitely geared to that function, including the essence-preservation machinery that makes our enemies more readily blameworthy for bad behavior than our allies and makes it easy to witness the suffering of our enemies with indifference.""In fact, 'satisfaction' is more like it than 'indifference.' One piece of moral equipment natural selection implanted in our brains is a sense of justice--the intuition that good deeds should be rewarded and bad deeds should be punished. So seeing evildoers suffer can give us the gratifying sense that justice has been done. And, conveniently, it's our enemies and rivals who typically are guilty of doing bad things; when our friends and allies do them, they are likely just victims of circumstance and so not deserving of harsh punishment. Unless, perhaps, they do bad things to *us,* which may be cause to start moving them out the 'friends and allies' category.""Bonus[es]: Not long after I'd written this review, I serendipitously came across two Tricycle articles (I wasn't looking for them), one (at https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/mindf... ) about Wright's view of mindful political resistance, and the other (at https://tricycle.org/trikedaily/why-b... ) that is Wright's encapsulation of the core ideas of ""Why Buddhism Is True."" Enjoy!"
37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50439065-sophia,Rating 1 out of 5,"I should have known. First a few disclaimers, this is nothing like the types of books I typically read and enjoy. I'm really more of a sci-fy fantasy person, I was just on a bit of a mindfulness kick and kept seeing this book mentioned on the forums. I'm also a biologist. I also listened to this on tape so I definitely didn't pay super close attention to every section.I'm not sure I am well versed enough in religious/philosophical writing to correctly articulate the issues I have with this book, but here's my best go at it. This book isn't really about Buddhism. The book's introduction and conclusion are both long lists of qualifiers about how the author is actually talking about the western world's interpretation of Buddhism and mindfulness meditation divorced from the teachings of the Buddhist religion. At one point near the end of the book the author even admits that he thinks it could be considered offensive for him to claim that he is a Buddhist because he doesn't believe many Buddhist teachings. I know almost nothing about Buddhism, but I do feel like it is a huge problem to name a book ""Why Buddhism is True"" and then pick and choose parts of the religion to defend while chalking the rest up to tradition. As someone who is not Buddhist, it seems problematic to me for the author to claim certain parts of the religion are more valid than others.I think if I had to try to summarize the author's motivation behind writing the book it would be that mindfulness meditation has helped him overcome a lot of struggles in his life by giving him the space to observe his emotional reactions to circumstances and assess their validity/decide logically whether he wants to allow himself to be affected by these emotions. He writes a lot about how he thinks that the widespread practicing mindfulness could break down what he calls ""tribal"" barriers. His examples of these tribal barriers are painfully privileged. He talks about how his greatest resistances to others come from differences in opinions on things like policies and philosophical theory, and maybe its just the time when I'm reading this, but it seems outrageous to me that he never discusses race and how mindfulness could be used as a tool to identify one's own racial biases. It is just so crazy to me how much time he dedicates to giving examples of identifying that a coworker's annoying behavior might just be influenced by their circumstances that day and other seemingly trivial examples of how mindfulness can allow you to be more like conscientious of the circumstances of the people around you without even really mentioning race. At the end the author talks about why mindfulness meditation is worth practicing and one of his conclusions is that it leads to what he literally terms ""valid happiness"". He defines ""valid"" in this context as something along the lines of ""more aligned with reality"". He has this running matrix metaphor throughout the book where he claims that practicing mindfulness meditation allows you to ""escape the matrix"" like Neo does, in that you can more clearly observe the factors motivating your emotions and in doing so have a clearer and more ""realistic"" and unbiassed view of reality. First of all, I just think valid happiness is a horrible phrase. I'm not sure I can get behind anyone defining what constitutes valid happiness for anyone else, it just seems extremely presumptive of an understanding of other peoples' conditions and quite frankly feels very condescending. Secondly, and this I think is more just me needing to read more philosophy, but I remain unconvinced that a more realistic/unbiassed view of reality will necessarily lead to more happiness. This I think is a bigger discussion and this review is already way too long.Also, my gosh is this dude obsessed with natural selection. Yes, we get it, Darwin was a smart dude and he really progressed the field of genetics a lot, but there is a fair amount of non-genetic inheritance that is also tremendously influential in evolution. Not to say that natural selection doesn't also influence those means of inheritance, it certainly does, but I'm not sure I can get behind just how entirely this author attributes all influences leading to the formation of humans to natural selection. He literally makes natural selection a character in the book and ascribes logic and motivations to this theoretical force. I found it a bit silly how he entirely rested much of his understanding of the formation of human ""instincts"" (if you will) on why natural selection might have wanted humans to behave certain ways.Also the book is incredibly repetitive and the organization made no sense to me. On the whole, this was really not the book for me."

39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23802045-vinit-nayak,Rating 4 out of 5,"Very insightful and raises very good discussion questions.As expected with a book of this kind, you have to go in w/ an open mind.More important TL;DRs:Feelings are very central and important to humans. They’ve been put in place by evolution to get us to where we are today. However, because we far outpaced the rate of evolution, they are now out-of-place and misinterpreted. Feelings aren’t “bad”, they do still provide us with many quick judgements that we wouldn’t be able to make at the conscious level. It’s just that they’re a double edged sword.Author argues that we are at the mercy of our emotions, which, given that modern society doesn’t match the environment where these feelings arose, can be harmful for us both mentally and physically. The way to “fight” this is via mindfulness meditation (you can read up on that at your own time). Essentially, observe your emotions before they have a chance to act for you. This is most easily done in a meditative environment where you are forced to focus. If your focus breaks, observe what caused your focus to break. Through this repetitive and arduous process of mental observation, one can get better at it in real-time and observe potentially negative emotions (anger, jealousy, etc) and curb them from acting on your behalf when it comes to your interactions with other people.Being able to do this, he argues, also will allow you to see other’s perspective and be less judgemental (where judgements = snap reactions from feelings you have, which you should be able to slow down by observation). Given how many millennials say “Don’t judge me” every hour, I think this might be worthwhile.That’s the most actionable, practical benefit I see."

The emphasis on the utilizing Buddhist ideas and practice to recognize the distortions in our perception of reality both inwardly and outwardly. The book covers several core Buddhist ideas, however, it doesn't actually spend much time with the mechanics of meditation practice. I would recommend that before anyone read this book, they learn and try a little meditation practice. It will help provide context for the concepts the author talks about. I don't think you need to spend a lot of time, just simply try it for a week or two first.And for those of you unfamiliar with Buddhism, don't be afraid of these ideas. There's a famous quote from the Dalai Lama: ""Do not try to use what you learn from Buddhism to be a Buddhist; use it to be a better whatever-you-already-are."" The concepts in this book can benefit anyone without them abandoning their current belief system. Whether you are an atheist, fundamentalist Christian, Jew or Muslim, the concepts in taught in this book and secular Buddhism will only enhance your existing spiritual and religious practices. This book discusses some very heavy, often at times, paradoxical concepts. I think it's a good idea to pace yourself. Read/listen to a little bit and then give yourself time to reflect and ponder on what has been said so that you can fully appreciate the ideas presented. "

42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2168708-marta,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have finished kind of speed listening to this book; but I am also slow-reading it with my husband which certainly will feel different, as reading it out loud and discussing had produced hilarious fits of laughter (like why we don’t see the phrase “stop and smell the feces” pop up often in modern Western Buddhist teachings). While this is not exactly a laugh-out-loud book, the author occasionally throws in some snark and self-deprecation. He also often feels self-indulgent, which is kinda weird in a book spending a large part on non-self and non-attachment. It does make sense, though, as the premise is relating evolutionary psychology to Buddhist traditions. Science has data to draw on, but meditative experience is personal, and Wright uses himself as the “laboratory rat”. This leads to many reflective passages. In many ways this makes this book a better starting point to non-meditators than those by renown teachers: everyday people will never spend as much time in meditation as spiritual leaders and will never reach the experiences they do. Yet, Wright says, we all can get glimpses into mental states and joyous experiences, if we have a regular practice. We can all get happier, beat up on ourselves less, and overall be kinder and more compassionate to our fellow beings. I can attest to that. I have been practicing about 15 minutes a day for several months, and was much calmer, less irritable, and achieved deep states of physical relaxation and happy moments. After a while I let my practice slide, and my irritability and tendency to see others as “jerks” if they bugged me, returned. I am picking meditation back up and slowly feeling that my negative emotions rule me less. I use different types of guided meditations. I feel that after practicing with guidance for a while I can sit in silence on my own, but if out of practice, I just end up thinking about my grocery list, work problems, or the latest book I am reading... you get the idea. Wright’s solution is to sign up for a retreat - mine is Insight Timer.Anyway, about the book. The premise is that evolution created our brains to do one thing: to propagate our genes. Activities that help this are pleasurable - such as eating, mating, feeling good at a social success. Things that endanger us we feel aversion for, such as being afraid of a lion, averse to illness and unclean things, etc, hating bitter things, etc. However, many of these basic instincts do not serve our happiness, or in fact, get in the way of it in our modern society. In addition, pleasure is designed to be fleeting - so that we will seek it again. After we eat that cake, the satisfaction will linger only a little bit before the sugar low hits.Wright started to look for solutions to address the inherent unhappiness in how we are wired, and found it in meditation practices. Buddhist thinkers have figured this out a long time ago. They say that our default way of looking at the world is a delusion: we create stories, attachments, seek fleeting pleasures, only to find they don’t satisfy. This condition is described by the Buddha as “suffering”, and his prescription is meditative practice (I am simplifying here).I do not wish to repeat all that’s in the book - read it if you are interested in psychology or meditation, or feel that you could use an aid in getting your mind off the hamster wheel occasionally. It gets a bit tiresome in the chapters about non-self and emptiness, as I felt they are long and don’t go anywhere, but overall I found the exercise enlightening and interesting.One problem I had with the book is that Wright admits he does not get lovingkindness meditation. Personally that is what I enjoy the most and what lets you cultivate your best side - compassion, kindness, sympathetic joy towards others. His lack of lovingkindness practice shows up towards the end when he can’t explain why meditative practice leads to more joy and appreciation of beauty. Well, there are two explanations (see my favorite spiritual book: Lovingkindness: The Revolutionary Art of Happiness). The Buddhist one is that goodness is our basic nature, and that being free from aversions will make you happy. The scientific one - and as evolutionary psychologist, Wright should have mentioned this - is that our negative emotions, that are processed in the amygdala, are more dominant and immediate than the positive ones. This is because fear, hate and disgust often require immediate reactions, such as running away from the lion or spitting out the poisonous fruit. When we calm our thoughts, thus we calm our negative emotions more, and the positive ones can come forward. Also, the absence of negative feelings often inspires joy. Have you ever had to pee really really badly, then felt wonderful after you finally got to that bathroom?Overall, this is a good book, but far from perfect. It is actually a very personal book as Wright filters much of it through his experiences, and has clear opinions. Thus I felt that the science was somewhat lacking and the Buddhism was rather limited by Wright’s personal understanding, or often, non-understanding. Nevertheless the approach is unique and important, as it validates that much of the psychological barriers to our happiness a.) are built into us by evolution; and b.) can be eliminated, or at least loosened, by the ancient Buddhist traditions.In other words: meditation works. Science proves that it makes us happier. Old and new come together."

All of the spiritual and metaphysical aspects of Buddhism are left out and the book fails to resonate as a serious discussion of this great philosophy."

45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1571969-billie-pritchett,Rating 4 out of 5,"UPDATED REVIEW: Tuesday, July 12, 2022 (4 stars)I am extremely sympathetic to the work Robert Wright is doing in this book, but I think we need make no mistake about what it is he is doing in this book. Having been exposed to a certain Buddhist tradition built around insight meditation, Wright cherry-picks pieces of this subset of the religion that will jibe with facts about the world as we know them, then having cherry-picked what he wanted, he concludes that Buddhism is true. I wonder about the value of this project or if it's even ethical to do. Granted, it's not an ethical violation like theft, more along the lines of gauche etiquette. And sure, we all accept the practice, because we live in a cosmopolitan world and we want to understand other cultures but how respectful is it to a culture or cultural practice if we eat only the nummy bits? I'm saying all this and yet I quite like this book.All right, let's get down to brass tacks. Why, according to Wright, is Buddhism true? Hard to answer this question, because Wright has so intertwined his understanding of biology with his selective examples from Buddhism that it's tough to tell what's what. Like this, for instance. Wright tells us that one thing that makes insight-meditation Buddhism true is that the meditative practice allows us to see that we don't naturally perceive the world clearly. Strictly speaking, sitting on a cushion and observing your thoughts and emotions tells you nothing. If you want it to tell you anything, you will have to rely on prior assumptions.I'm doing all the talking. Let's let Wright speak for himself. He says that in particular this brand of Buddhism can show us that we ""tend to anticipate more in the way of enduring satisfaction from the attainment of goals than will in fact transpire. This illusion, and the resulting mind-set of perpetual aspiration, makes sense as a product of natural selection, but it's not exactly a recipe for lifelong happiness."" Notice the tucking in of natural selection there. Yes, right, the idea that we expect greater returns from what we want than what we get from what we want makes sense in terms of natural selection, but neither the claim that we expect greater returns from what we want than what we get from what we want nor the claim that this illusion arises because of natural selection can be derived from sitting on a cushion and meditating. Emphatically, at most, what meditation like focusing on your breath can get you is the realization that in moments when you are trying to concentrate on something like breathing, your thoughts and your emotions will carry you away. That is, at most, the conclusion you can draw. It might not be too big a leap to say, then, that most of our waking life is like that, though, that is, that in our waking life we are mostly beholden to our thoughts and feelings, and we might do better to realize this, that we don't have to succumb to our particular thought or feeling in a particular moment. In that way, I understand what Wright is saying and I think there might be value in the whole rigmarole of what he's doing with this book.ORIGINAL REVIEW: August 31, 2017 (3 stars)I listened to Robert Wright's Why Buddhism Is True in audiobook format. I'm glad I did. It's a good work. What Wright does in the book is argue for the major tenants and practices of Buddhism insofar as they help us with the tendencies we've been endowed with through natural selection. For example, anger as an emotion may have served our species inasmuch as it helped propagate our genes, but it does very little for us in the modern world. It might be more useful to adopt some of the meditative practices like control of breath and other mindfulness techniques in order to help us be more compassionate rather than angry. This is the way Wright tends to make his arguments in the book."
46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7310589-tadeas-petak,Rating 5 out of 5,"A good friend of mine suggested this book for a book circle, which was awesome, as it made me read it a bit more thoroughly than I would have otherwise. Given the topic, showing that modern psychology corroborates buddhism and its theories, it is a very good idea to be paying attention.First things first. If you find the title of the book off-putting, don’t despair. The author goes out of his way to explain why he chose it and multiple times states that he realises how bold of a statement this is. Anyway, with the out of the way: the book is wicked.Here’s what I would like to carry around with me having read this:

   - Natural selection favours genes being transfered to the next generation, not seeing the world clearly. Often, seeing the world objectively is actually at odds with DNA preservation. If you realise you’re really only as important as everybody else, that could be detrimental for your DNA, especially when compared to you being the centre of the universe, right? This results in an abundance of illusions causing all sorts of afflictions to human beings. 
  
   - We tend to expect more satisfaction from achieving goals than will in reality transpire. I remember reading a study on dopamine release that showed that the vast majority of this chemical is in fact released during the anticipatory phase rather than after achieving that whatever (eating, having sex, …). This often results in dukkha, ""suffering"" or ""unsatisfactoriness"", i.e. being unhappy about the state of events, wanting more, i.e. tanha, which then causes more dukkha. Yay. 
  
   - Our understanding of ""self"" is very misleading indeed. Most of us tend to embrace feelings and thoughts as our own and anything outside our skin as foreign. Looking at the mind as a set of modules (my favourite chapter in the book!) enables as to appreciate the reality: there is no single self. Rather, there is a collection of overlapping modules specialised in dealing with concrete domains activated by emotions. That role of conscious self is then to observe whatever bubbles up, possibly do some analysis (although independent thinking would be taking it too far), send that information down and then let the modules grapple to make a decision manifested in our actions or ensuing conscious thoughts bubbling up. 
  
   - I love the idea that the conscious self is really only a marketing manager: My guess is that the reason your conscious mind observes the debate, including the winning rationale, is so that if someone ever asks you why you did x, y, or z, you’ll be able to cite a plausible rationale. I mean, gosh, if this is the case, how different should our attitude towards our selves be? 
  
   - The author explores two versions of non-self experience: interior and exterior. Interior means not identifying with your feelings and thoughts, while exterior refers to us identifying more with anything coming from the outside. Ultimately then, you would end up not distinguishing between the two, at least not emotionally. It’s obvious how dealing with negative emotions would become way easier then, as they would be as much part of you as if they were coming from someone else. 
  
   - We perceive things to have an inherent ""essence"", which is, most likely, natural selection’s way of assigning emotional significance important for our survival. Of course, this can be extremely misleading in many cases and escaping this perceptual construct can help e.g. eradicate contrived borders between groups of people. 
  
The point of mindfulness meditation then is to allow us to see this (more) clearly, understand all these facts not only intellectually but also experientially. By taking a step back, we can take the wind out of emotions’ sails and be more in charge of how we react and who we are.Some of my favourite quotes from the book can be found here."
47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2606116-jonathan,Rating 1 out of 5,"Would have been better titled, “Why Some Central Tenets of Buddhism Are Compatible with Finidngs of Evolutionary Psychology.” Mostly it centers on Buddhism’s diagnosis of the human condition and how current research seems to support it. (It’s probably helpful that psychology offers no such diagnosis itself for comparison.) With the exception of mindfulness meditation, for which there is ample evidence, the arguments are mostly ad hoc rationalizations of Buddhism’s metaphysics (doctrines of emptiness, no-self, etc.), which the author intuits can help combat some of mother nature’s negative evolutionary influence. A lot of this ends up being a rehash of Stoic wisdom and CBT. At other points, to justify which evolutionary tendencies we ought to combat, he invokes ideas of health and wellbeing which actually have their ancestry in Aristotelian teleological ethics. This is doubly ironic because the author clearly sees humanity as essentially characterized by evolutionary “design” (an essence which excludes a telos so conceived), but also because he defends the Buddhist rejection of essences altogether (which would rule out an essense of evolution-driven design). Pretty sloppy, in my opinion. It seems to me like he’s still grapping with the very meaning/implication of some of these concepts, and that his evolutionary-psychology approach is not entirely helpful to him, and therefore, to the reader.In conclusion: don’t be fooled by the provocative title, this is just pop-psychology hogwash."

He's well-known as a sort of irascible atheistic moralist (The Moral Animal, The Evolution of God, etc.) and so maybe not someone I'd have expected to dive into mindfulness meditation, but in fact he's been practicing since 2003 and here he shares observations on his own experiences and then applies evolutionary psychology and cognitive neuroscience to understanding the meditating mind. I'm not going to summarize the ideaa; I think I'll re-read the book in a couple of months.-- I listened to the audiobook and while I'd recommend the audio for Fred Sanders's reading, I found so many ideas to ponder that I frequently had to pause the book or go back to re-play passages. It's that kind of book. Also, I said when beginning that the title was amusing - (like Dennett's ""Consciousness Explained""), but Wright explains his reasons for choosing the title."

Honestly, I find this interesting primarily because I have started to ~practice mindfulness~ when rock climbing as hard as I can. I've read a lot about focusing on breathing, visualization, etc., and because this borders on meditation, my interest is piqued.Unfortunately, I bought little to none of what this book was selling. I could go on a rant about what I believe makes for a coherent and consistent worldview and how I believe scientific studies shouldn't be retrofitted to confirm peripherally related beliefs and all that.... BUT, I think that at the end of the day the issue is this: Eastern thought and spirituality are foreign to me. Much of this book was outside of my paradigm, so it seemed non-sensical to me.

Near the end of the book, it strays into enlightenment, but I wouldn't say that's the main focus of the book.I've enjoyed this author before and I appreciate his witty writing style that lends itself to the common man or laymen in the field of science and psychology. While the book gets quite wordy, tedious and ""heavy"" with information and explanations, I found that it wasn't too taxing because the short chapters give hope for the end in sight. ha! He mixes in his witty references and stories with the (sometimes) arduous and laborious facts. I will say that the deeper into the book I read, the more complicated it became.IN a nutshell:"" the human brain is a machine designed to respond in pretty reflexive fashion to the sensory input impinging on it. The brain is designed to be controlled by that input. "" Feelings arise out of that input. ""But if you observe those feelings mindfully rather than reacting to them, you can in some measure escape the control."" And the author expands greatly on that. He gives scientific evidence why it's true, and how meditation affects the body and mind.It's truly a fascinating book. It has absolutely made me want to begin meditating."

In “Why Buddhism is True” Wright takes us along on his wary journey through the world of Buddhist meditation. Despite his questioning and resistance, he comes out the other side a firm believer in the power of meditation. I found this book delightfully approachable. Wright has a gift for diving into the heart of really complicated topics, finding the essence, then writing books that make those topics lucidly accessible. All along the way, his clever irascibility and skepticism make the journey very entertaining.The primary focus of the book is to answer one question: is meditation effective?Millions of years of natural selection have optimized the human brain for survival and passing along DNA to the next generation. Mother nature did a bang-up job at this. Humans survived to the present day, but our brains are now disturbingly outdated. Our minds are optimized for survival in hunter gatherer tribes, not for life in modern cities.Being eaten by large predators and starving to death were important day-to-day problems back then. Human brains evolved ingenious systems that made surviving these omnipresent threats job number one. Today, more people die from eating too much food than too little. Most people don’t fret about being eaten by lions on the way to work.The problem is that human brains have not had time to adapt. They are still optimize for those ancient tribal days. The result is war, jealousy, worry, road rage and other really unnecessary occurrences of psychological mayhem. Wright shows us that there’s now a way to upgrade your mind and better manage your caveman thinking - meditation. He shows us that with just a bit of practice, we can be less of a slave to our thoughts and actively choose the feelings we bring into our minds.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and learned a lot. Wright made a dense topic fun. The transparency he brought to his own journey was quite brave. He has a gift for anticipating all the crazy doubts and weird questions that the average person would ask about the daunting world of meditation practice. I walk away from this book with a better understanding of the crazy wanderings of day-to-day thinking and ways to tame my own wandering mind."
57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8776230-delany,Rating 2 out of 5,"When this book was first published and I saw it being promoted, I was seriously put off by the title (“Buddhism” is a vast topic with a few central propositions and endless permutations, interpretations of and extrapolations from these truths, along with legends, practices, cosmology, etc., and thus not a single proposition that is “true” or “false”) and decided it wasn’t for me. Then, upon reading a couple of very favorable reviews, I decided to give it a try. And I mean “try.” What I found was, as others have noted, an unremarkable discussion about meditation, with emphasis on his own experiences when he has practiced meditation. This then led to the author’s attempt to unpack and discuss the Buddhist concept of “non-self,” at which point he spun off into a turgid and tedious attempt at an explanation of the concept. It’s really not that difficult: (a) What we perceive as our “self” is a process, not a fixed entity, and thus it is always in flux, and (b) the more we focus on the wishes and preferences of our “self,” the more unhappy we tend to be.As a book about meditation, or as a book about the scientific evidence that supports the idea that meditation can be beneficial, or as a book about Buddhist history or doctrine — in each case, there are far better books out there."

It's kind of the book the Buddha might have written if he had been aware of the theory of evolution by natural selection. It's totally no-nonsense and very rational, and to me is motivating to continue to try to meditate.One of the most important things for me in the book is the confirmation that our evolution by natural selection didn't equip us to 1. see things clearly, 2. be happy and 3. be very good to one another (but rather just optimized us for the passing on of our genes), and that meditation, self-improvement and maybe culture and civilization in general are projects to lift us above the limits imposed on us by natural selection.The author concludes:""There's a lot to dislike about the world we're born into. It's a world in which, as the Buddha noted, our natural way of seeing, and of being, leads us to suffer and to inflict suffering on others. And it's a world that, as we now know, was bound to be that way, given that life on this planet was created by natural selection. Still, it may also be a world in which metaphysical truth, moral truth, and happiness can align, and a world that, as you start to realize that alignment, appears more and more beautiful."""

The author is not a master meditator spending his days teaching at meditation retreats. He has a real life with real-life problems such as a busy schedule and anxiety. Although, he did spend some time at retreats, he describes his own practice as modest. He makes a point out of this by trying to explain what makes him return to the cushion every day, even if it won't lead to enlightenment anytime soon. He roams between (secular) Buddhism and evolutionary psychology, trying to build a bridge between them, not by citing all the benefits scientific studies have found meditation to have, but more from a philosophical and personal angle, which makes this book very relatable. He also touches a lot of the concerns people usually have about meditation and it's philosophy, such as whether putting some distance between your self and your feelings makes you stop caring about things (spoiler: no). If I was asked which book to read by someone who is interested in the topic, I'd definitely recommend this one."

The primary title Why Buddhism is True is misleading, as the information presented focuses on secular Buddhist ideas, including the benefits of mindful meditation practice. Wright does mention this and provides an explanation as to why he still decided to chose the title. In a nutshell, the book covers select Buddhist themes related to human suffering, including how humans fail to see the world clearly based on illusory feelings and the cycle of craving, leading to attainment, eventually leading to more craving. Well, you get the idea. Meditation is offered as a way to reduce the suffering from these ongoing feelings and thoughts. Wright offers theories from evolutionary psychology as an explanation for some of these basic human behaviors. There were several concepts that I had difficulty embracing including the idea of ""not-self,"" with one definition stating the self simply doesn't exist. The author does present these ideas multiple times throughout the book and offers different definitions and perspectives. (In other words, is a glass half empty, half full or something in between? It is left open to interpretation and as reader, sometimes I couldn't decide which definition best aligned with my beliefs.) I could write several pages on this subject but then I'd just be delving into themes presented in the book that are too difficult to explain within the framework of a few sentences. I don't know if I accept or agree with everything presented by Wright but a lot of it does make sense. Even if some of my feelings are distorted, and I am sure that is the case, I am not willing to discount my intuition in certain situations. However, if mindful meditation can create a sense of inner calm and clearer view of the world, that seems like a good thing. If that translates into less (emotional) pain or reactivity and more empathy for other people, then even better. During the past eight years, I have noticed some positive effects from my own efforts to meditate, although I don't practice as often or long as I should to get the most benefits. Well, during the upcoming election process, it might be something I should consider practicing on a more regular basis. My apologies, if I have offended anyone. This book may not be for everyone but Wright does offer a free online class called Buddhism and Modern Psychology through Coursera. Otherwise, for someone new to these concepts or for children, there is always A Walk in the Wood: Meditations on Mindfulness with a Bear Named Pooh. Sometimes cute and sweet will suffice. "

Wright opens the book with a brief note to the reader, before dropping the

It is broken into well-defined chapters. Each chapter; into segmented writing with relevant headers at the top. I like when books are formatted like this, and tend to get the most from them when the information is conveyed in this manner.Wright details his experiences in a 7-day meditation retreat early on. He also mentions the different branches of Buddhist interpretation, and gives the reader a brief synopsis.He covers quite a lot of ground in the book, and bounces between modern science and ancient philosophy here in a way that I felt generally worked.Some more of what is covered here by Wright includes:• The ""hedonic treadmill""• Mindfulness and related practices• The left brain/right brain split; mental ""modules"" • Thought/self separation• Object and conceptual ""essence""• Feelings and Stories• A List of Buddhist Truths***********************As mentioned above, I did like this one. If I had to find fault with it, I would opine that some of the writing here gets a tad long-winded at times, especially during the last ~half of the book.

I was curious about how Wright would interpret Buddhism through the lens of evolutionary psychology, and I was not disappointed. This is not for beginners in either subject, really, and yet it will probably leave experts in both quite underwhelmed; for my purposes, however, the analysis delivered much of what I wanted, especially a sense of how ""enlightenment in the Buddhist sense has something in common with enlightenment in the Western scientific sense: it involves becoming more aware of what causes what."" Wright, using the perspective of evolutionary psychology, considers concepts such as the non-self and emptiness. He recasts many such Buddhist ideas in terms of ""the conditioned, the caused,"" illustrating how meditation allows conditioned beings like us to become aware of the causes impinging on us, manipulating us and pushing our buttons for obsolete reasons, and thus empowers us to allow mindfulness to ""critically intervene."" In short, I found this to be a wonderfully fascinating study of one subject through another."
70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1432012-mark-robison,Rating 5 out of 5,"I find myself thinking about this book a lot and talking about its claims with friends. Its overall claim is that evolution has created humans to value carrying on genes over perceiving reality accurately, and this causes much human suffering. It then explains two of the hardest Buddhist concepts using science: emptiness and no-self. In short, modules in the brain constantly throw thoughts at the mind in an effort to bring their priorities to the forefront, such as hunger, the need for status, the need to procreate, etc. The thoughts are not you but rather these evolutionary processes that seem to work better if you think you’re in charge of them. Also, your brain creates cognitive shortcuts by creating essences of things you encounter, such as home or your loved ones or trees. These essences cause you to label things, often inaccurately, but in ways that help you deal with them from a purely gene-survival standpoint. Meditation, if done regularly and preferably deeply, can strip away these illusions and help you live more deeply and meaningfully. This all might make it sound like a difficult book to read, but Wright writes conversationally, as if he’s talking to a friend about a complex subject. It gets pretty deep sure, but Wright doesn’t let it devolve into philosophical jargon. For me, this book was a game-changer in my intellectual life. Grade: A"

I found the course to be extraordinarily rewarding. I learned so much about the tenets of Buddhism and about evolutionary biology and psychology. The idea that natural selection hasn’t given our minds a clear view of reality is so compelling, and idea that mediation can be a tool to rebel against limitations and biases of our own nature is brilliant, if not life changing. So, I was eager to return to the same concepts in the book based off the course material.I was disappointed. The author’s familiar tone and repeated usage of his handful of anecdotes from his personal meditation experiences are quickly tiring. The interviews with scholars and practitioners that Wright had for his online course don’t translate well into written back-and-forth narratives. The second half of the book seems even more muddled than the first half. There are so many asides and nonlinear narratives, it was felt a stream of consciousness. Or it was more like a lecture where the professor has a broad idea of what is to be covered but adds personal color and thoughts throughout. Maybe that’s good for the classroom but not on the page."

83,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73419547-doctor-moss,Rating 4 out of 5,"There are a lot of popular books around about Buddhism for westerners. What makes this different is that Robert Wright’s goal is to show that some core tenets of Buddhism are borne out by modern, evolutionary psychology — hence the claim that Buddhism is “true.” Maybe the core insight that Wright draws from evolutionary psychology is that human beings did not evolve to become truth-detectors. They evolved to reproduce successfully. You might think that the one would serve the other — that survival to reproductive age and caring for our young depended on our perceiving the world truthfully. But Wright gives persuasive examples where the two, truth and survival of the species, may diverge. Our senses, for example, may over-protect us, sensitizing us to dangers in our environment so much so that we react to a stirring in the grass that is actually just a lizard or the wind, to ensure that when there really is a poisonous snake, we will react. We may over-react 10 times for every one time that there really is a snake in the grass, but being wrong most of the time is worth it when the stakes are sufficiently high.The link from there to Buddhism is the first Buddhist “truth” that Wright lists in an appendix — “Human beings often fail to see the world clearly, and this can lead them to suffer and to make others suffer.” The example of the snake in the grass may seem not to pose a real problem, but Wright points to many things that evolution has prepared us for but that no longer serve us well — our attraction to sweet foods for example. When sweet foods were rare, their calorie density justified, in evolutionary terms, our attraction to them. Now that they are plentiful, that instinctive attraction works to our detriment. More to Wright’s ultimate point, evolution has given us tribalistic outlooks. We display a bias towards our friends and community — people like us — and against those who are unlike us — people from other “tribes”, e.g., of different ethnicities, beliefs, or appearance. As the technologies of conflict advance, the costs of that bias increase to potential catastrophic scales.Wright does have a big practical, ambitious goal in writing the book — nothing less than promoting world peace. He believes we are at a “moment of truth” in which we need to solve “the problem of ethnic, religious, national, and ideological conflict that can feed on itself, creating a spiral of growing hatred that leads to true catastrophe.” He does want to “help save the world”. Buddhist insight and practices could help us, he is claiming, toward that goal. It’s not that everyone is going to become a Buddhist (he doesn’t even claim that he is a Buddhist himself), but that the influence of Buddhism’s “truth” on our culture could have a crucial beneficial effect.He also means to address the theoretical side of Buddhism. Wright wants to “explore the scientific foundations of a Buddhist worldview.” He warns that he doesn’t mean by that, validating, for example, that the practice of meditation can reduce stress (not that it doesn’t). He wants to go deeper, into a Buddhist view of the world as illusion, partly for practical purposes, but also, more generally, to help us get ourselves right with the world.There are numerous aspects to what he calls “scientific foundations”. And he develops, or refers to, numerous theoretical claims. One is a “modular” theory of mind — Wright expands a Buddhism-inspired discussion of the non-existence of the self, or of “not-self”, into a theory of mind as a playing field of competing “modules”, with no overlying “CEO-Self” in charge and making final decisions. Decisions are made by the competition among the modules, such as a “mate-acquisition module” which may compete with a module that serves to warn us away from potential mates already in relationships. While Wright is capturing something valid in introspection, that we do seem to entertain contests between competing potentials rather than engaging in cool deliberation over all our interests, the status of these “modules” is unclear. Dividing up our thoughts into modules seems imprecise — what modules we think there might be, what their boundaries would be, etc., seems more a matter of our power to imagine them than our ability to discern “real” modules. Wright depends centrally, though, upon the core claim mentioned above, that evolution has prepared us for spreading our genes — reproducing and rearing offspring. Our perceptions and feelings are tuned to that goal, rather than to perceiving the world “clearly”, as it actually is. What Buddhism will contribute is the ability to begin to clear away some of those illusions that natural selection has equipped us with, notably our feelings — our positive and negative sensitivities and biases — that distort our perceptions of reality. What is called for is the ability to transcend our nature — to get beyond those biased sensitivities that may have once served us well in our history as a species, but that now threaten our ability to live in peace, both in our everyday lives and as a world community.Wright is aware of the difficulty of this notion of a clear, unbiased experience of reality. He, like others in discussing related Buddhist concepts, tends to define what he means negatively — the “unconditoned”, “emptiness”, “formlessness”, “not-self”. It is hard to speak in positive terms, when all of experienced reality, all perception, is delusion. What is there when the delusion is wiped away is the absence of familiar reality. And we don’t have a way to perceive it or to describe it in positive terms, since perception itself is delusion.Wright shies away from the idea of a mystical experience of reality — such a thing would not fit his goal of squaring Buddhist insight with scientific psychology. Rather he tries to describe a clear experience of reality as acquiring a kind of distance from our feelings, a more deliberate way of engaging or not engaging with our sensitivities and biases. Where they serve us, we engage, and where they do not serve us, we withdraw from them.I think that where I’m left after having read the book is that I know more than I knew about the potential compatibility between evolutionary psychology and Buddhist insights. I’m not convinced — the arguments have a loose quality about them. All arguments to the effect that something (e.g., perceptual biases and sensitivities) is the result of natural selection seem to me to carry a kind of post hoc character. Yes, it makes sense, that evolution would have provided us an oversensitivity to the possible presence of poisonous snakes, and that that could explain whey we are gripped with fear when the rustling in the grass is actually just the wind or a lizard. But its making sense isn’t evidence of its actually having happened that way. The post hoc reasoning for evolutionary processes seems very loose — given result x, it just seems a matter of exercising our storytelling ingenuity to come up with an evolutionary explanation of how x came to be, how it provided some survival and/or reproductive advantage. Whether the story is true or not is another matter. And when we actually examine the evolution of human behaviors and characteristics, e.g., tool-use, language, etc., they actually turn out to be very messy stories, with lots of twists and turns rather than a simple compelling rationale.I use the word “compatibility” to describe the relation Wright draws between evolutionary psychology and Buddhist tenets rather than his own word, “corroboration”. He would like to say that evolutionary psychology “corroborates” core Buddhist tenets. I think that’s a stronger claim than his argument supports. Buddhists, of course, have not traditionally claimed that delusion is borne from natural selection, even though, according to Wright, they end up in similar positions with respect to our “not seeing the world clearly”. I’m not even sure what would constitute corroboration, given the very different contexts in which Buddhist tenets have been developed and in which evolutionary psychology has been developed."

Or not christian as it leaves a lot of room for interpretation (and Jesus is still widely misunderstood), but that of the church. We are definitely not detached from its power, no, not at all.Religions are mainly born out of our anxiety that comes from the understanding of time and thus, ultimately, death. They are stories based on lies based on fears. Fear generates anger. That is why to me christianity is fundamentally evil, based on control and fear and lies.I would say it's silly nonsense, but it's not – it's evil, inhumane, shameful.I don't believe in any goodness that is based in a reward or a punishment.Buddhism, tao, zen, eastern religions are based on the truth and the truth is in the constant change of everything, yet the timeless unity of all things living.The non-self, the emptiness.

85,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"As advertised, the book dives pretty deep into the Buddhist understanding of reality. It turns out that facets of Buddhism and meditation that might be considered esoteric and uncomfortably mystical line up pretty well with leading theories in evolutionary psychology and neuroscience. Wright meticulously works his way through experimental evidence and spiritual insights to produce a picture of the mind that makes sense, especially in terms of what we see when we meditate. He argues that the slow but cumulative way in which meditation makes us more calm and compassionate people, so too can it be a salve for the tribalism and reactionary violence which threatens the future of our species. At first, I found the writing style to be a bit repetitive. However, I liked it more and more as I read further. The ideas are fairly complex, and I began to see how Wright's style mirrors how we think about and figure out ideas in our own head. He is almost taking the reader on a journey of his thought processes, how he was able to tie a number of ideas into a cohesive story. I also feared that the book would be an piece of materialist bravado, where the measly spiritual insight would be vindicated by the all-powerful, all-knowing scientific method. However, Wright keeps a respectful, if skeptical, alliance with the spiritual. This I think, is exactly as it should be. Overall, curisosity is encouraged. I think that readers are likely to look with a little more curisosity at their thoughts and feelings, and hopefully, with a little more compassion as well."
86,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41901229-gary-moreau,Rating 4 out of 5,"One of the main tenets of Buddhism and this book is that our thoughts inevitably come with feelings attached. These feelings can be good or bad, but they are always deceptive. It seems a bit unfair, therefore, to ask reviewers to pick 1-5 stars in order to provide an arbitrary overall rating of the book. You may love it or you may not. For me, there were times when I thought of putting it down. In the end, however, I’m very glad I read it.If you practice mindfulness meditation or are thinking about trying, you should definitely read this book. The author devotes considerable time and effort to his own meditative journey, readily admitting that he wasn’t very good at it to begin with. (Personally, I don’t meditate. But I lived in China for nine years and have a keen interest in Eastern philosophy.)If you’re considering this book because you believe it offers some scientific proof that Buddhism is true, there’s a good chance it won’t quite get there for you. But it all depends on your perspective of science. If, as the phrase popularized by Karl Popper suggests, you hold the conviction that a theory has to be disprovable for it to be scientific, the evidence, I think, will come up short. What Professor Wright does do, however, is use his own experience in meditation, and a whole lot of contemporary psychological research, to build a fairly strong circumstantial case, should you be open to it.Part of the author’s emphasis on meditation appears to be a personal bias toward experiential learning and I tend to share it. If you have the same experience he has had in your journey of meditation then the arguments he presents for the validity of secular Buddhist doctrine will be fairly easy to embrace.One caution, however. One of the limitations to effective debate of anything philosophical, and Buddhism in particular, is the fact that language itself is a human construct developed largely to promote efficiency and effectiveness. Efficient, however, isn’t always effective where issues of philosophy and the nature of the universe are involved. Often times, those attempting to communicate are forced to resort to words that are well outside the vocabulary of most Western secularists. In the case of Buddhism that means words and phrases like, dukkha, tanha, and paticca-samuppada. The professor explains them with clarity, but better to be prepared.Counter-intuitively, the complexity of language that can be necessitated when communicating the nuanced concepts of things like Buddhism can be a handicap for the brilliant and articulate, like Robert Wright. Because these scholars and teachers appreciate the nuance of language most of us don’t, their communication can sometimes present a challenge to the faint of heart. I realized shortly into this book that I should limit my reading to 20 pages at a sitting. Otherwise I experienced the same inability to focus that the author describes in his initial and quickly failed attempts to meditatively focus on his breathing. One concept that the author is crystal clear on is natural selection. Early in the book, Professor Wright notes, “Still, ultimately, natural selection cares about only one thing (or, I should say, “cares”—in quotes—about only one thing, since natural selection is just a blind process, not a conscious designer). And that one thing is getting genes into the next generation.” That belief, both in its veracity and in its relatively shallow depth, is the foundation for much of the connection he draws between Buddhism and the fundamentals of evolutionary psychology.I struggled with that for much of the book, to be honest. I fully embrace evolution, do not identify as a member of any organized religion, and am generally “scientific” in my world view. I resist, however, the characterization that the universe is guided solely by an indiscriminate need to perpetuate the gene pool. Why would it be?In the end, however, Dr. Wright lightens his grip. “I sometimes think this heightened sense of beauty is what can give emptiness [in the Buddhist sense] an ironic moral power.” And, “In any event, I remain flummoxed by what seems to be a natural tendency of contemplative practice to strengthen the sense of beauty.” Implying, of course, that beauty is itself transcendent.It becomes increasingly clear as you read, moreover, that Dr. Wright’s motivation in both pursuing meditation and writing this book itself transcends both meditation and Buddhism. He’s worried about the state of the planet and the destruction brought about by “the psychology of tribalism.” The boundaries of the tribe take many forms, from ethnicity and religion to ideology. All, he suggests, threaten our very existence, much less anything close to social progress.The money line for me was, “We don’t have to love our enemies, but seeing them clearly is essential. And one lesson from both Buddhist philosophy and modern psychology is that seeing them clearly involves dialing down the fear and loathing, but also more than that; it involves transcending much subtler distortions of perception and cognition, often distortions that are grounded in subtler feelings.”And that’s ultimately where the Buddhist notion of emptiness, whether secular or spiritual, places the marker of nirvana, I think. We may never get there, but the reward and the journey are incremental. And that may just be the one structural aspect of the universe we will never fully comprehend. Thankfully, it doesn’t matter.Thank you, Robert Wright, for a very good read."

88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19168860-scott,Rating 2 out of 5,"Meh. I didn't love this. It's a mix of comparing the latest in neuroscience/evolutionary psychology and Buddhism and the author's own opinions and feelings on mindfulness meditation. It's a little light on the science, it doesn't offer anything in the way of instruction, and it's quite a bit of navel-gazing. So it didn't really hit the spot for me, but it does have some interesting nuggets.Basically, the book does what it's subtitle says: it looks at the links between science and the Buddhist idea of enlightenment derived from mindfulness meditation. He also talks about some elements of Buddhist ideas about the mind and tries to explain how these ideas match up with the latest science. For example, Buddhism argues that there is no such thing as a self. Is that true? Well, it seems like it. The latest theory about the mind is that we have a bunch of different modules inside our heads. Each of these modules tries to influence us using feelings. In different contexts, different modules are more powerful. If we see someone attractive, then that will trigger our mate-acquisition module (or something like that), which will cause us to try to look really good in front of the attractive person and also to tear down our potential rivals. In other situations, other modules are more powerful. If this is true, which is truly our self? Often we argue, when we get road rage or experience other powerful negative emotions, that we are no longer ourselves. Then, what are we? It seems that our ""selves"" are more fractured than we like to think.Buddhism also argues that the world is empty, a concept that I had a bit of trouble understanding but will do my best to explain here. Basically, our minds normally attach goodness or badness to almost everything we see in the world. Snakes are bad. Attractive people are good. Poison is bad. Tasty food is good. But if we try to examine the world objectively, this goodness or badness doesn't really exist. Things just are. They are empty of the meaning that we try to attach to those things. The book spends a lot of time talking about this.The book also argues that most of what we are motivated to do/not do in life has been determined by natural selection. However, given our modern world, our natural selection-inspired instincts don't always work as intended. Basically, natural selection wants us to be healthy and propagate our genes. This means eating good food and having a lot of kids. But our minds get confused by stuff like french fries. Fries are bad for us, but our natural selection-brains really want them. Here's an example of evolution leading to a suboptimal outcome. We can overcome those bad instincts, though, with stuff like mindfulness meditation.Most of this stuff was interesting. I didn't really know about the ideas about our mental modules and found that pretty fascinating. It's also kind of disturbing. I've been watching this show called The Good Place lately. The main characters have died and are in The Good Place - Heaven. But I've often wondered: what exactly is going into this afterlife? Is it our bodies? Our brains? Our bodies/brains from when? If, right before we died, we were suffering from dementia, is that what ends up in the afterlife? Or is it us from some healthier, younger time? And, if so, from when? It doesn't really make a ton of sense on analysis, and those ideas are even more shattered when you think that a self doesn't even really exist. This kind of freaks me out. So a lot of these ideas just kind of go against this pleasant, but silly, idea of life and the afterlife that I have in my head. It scared me, which made reading the book not-so-pleasant. Still, that's not really the main reason I'm not giving this five stars.Another thing that bothered me is that the book never really talks about exactly what mindfulness meditation is. Or how you go about meditating. Or recommendations on how you can achieve the sorts of things that the author talks about. So... I'm not really getting a ton out of this book. It only tells me that it might be worthwhile to investigate other resources to determine how to achieve mindfulness.Except... the arguments in this book aren't really all that persuasive. There's such an odd mix of some pieces of scientific studies and theories, the author's experiences, and the author's somewhat rambling thoughts about science and mindfulness. The mishmash makes the book unconvincing on each of these dimensions. If there had been more of a focus on any one of those routes, I think I would have been more compelled by the book.On the whole, I don't know that anyone would get very much out of this book. It has a strong recommendation: meditate. But it won't help you figure out how to meditate, and it's got some not-so-convincing arguments. There are probably better books that will present stronger evidence for meditation, and also provide you with more helpful information. "

things comes with stories, and the stories, whether true or false, shape how we feel about the things and thus shape the things themselves, giving them the full form we perceive.
robert wright's new book, why buddhism is true: the science and philosophy of meditation and enlightenment is, more or less, exactly as described in the subtitle. in lieu of a theological or metaphysical examination of buddhism, wright approaches the science behind it, arguing ""buddhism's diagnosis of the human predicament is fundamentally correct, and that its prescription is deeply valid and urgently important.""
that's the way the perception of essence works: it smuggles judgement into our mind by cloaking them in feelings that are themselves so subtle, or at least so routine as to often escape conscious recognition. and these feelings, these elementary ingredients of perceived essence are by their nature ties to a particular perspective—the perspective of a species, or (as in the ferrari case) the perspective of an individual within that species. from the perspective that einstein considered the truest perspective—the point of view from no particular point—feelings don't even exist, and so essence doesn't either.
wright considers the myriad benefits of mediation, as well as headier concepts of non-self and emptiness. the pulitzer finalist, himself a skeptic, relates his own personal experiences with mediation, mindfulness, and the like, reporting positive benefits that were seemingly surprising even to him. why buddhism is true doesn't aim to convert nor proselytize, but instead advocates for seeing reality as clearly as we can and stripping the veneer of illusion from our engagement with the world. frequently humorous and easily accessible even to those without much prior exposure to buddhism (or science, for that matter), wright's new book offers considerable food for thought.the things in your environment—the sights, the sounds, the smells, the people, the news, the videos—are pushing your buttons, activating feelings that, however subtly, set in motion trains of thought and reaction that govern your behavior, sometimes in ways that are unfortunate. and they will keep doing that unless you start paying attention to what's going on.this has been the point of much of this book. the human brain is a machine designed by natural selection to respond in pretty reflexive fashion to the sensory input impinging on it. it is designed, in a certain sense, to be controlled by that input. and a key cog in the machinery of control is the feelings that arise in response to that input. if you interact with those feelings via tanha—via the natural, reflexive thirst for the pleasant feelings and the natural, reflexive aversion to the unpleasant feelings—you will continue to be controlled by the world around you. but if you observe those feelings mindfully rather than just react to them, you can in some measure escape the control; the causes that ordinarily dictate your behavior can be defied, and you can get closer to the unconditioned."

93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4061006-briz,Rating 4 out of 5,"A lively, charming look into Buddhist philosophy and its benefits to a Western practitioner. I was surprised to see that Robert Wright hasn't written a bunch of other Buddhist books, since this was a dense-yet-approachable look into the deepest pits of what makes Buddhism Buddhism, and he just sounded like a long-time practitioner and Buddhist scholar. But dude's just a smart journalist! And, yes, okay, he has been meditating some pretty hardcore Vipassana for the last ~20 years. Fair.So this book is going to appeal to the mostly-secular American Buddhist - it's an intellectual and well-researched look at how meditation, coupled with certain Buddhist ""truths"" about the nature of identity, of reality, and of individuality, can be ""proven"" by, well, a lot of evolutionary psychology and behavioral economics research. Wright uses humor - even CHEEK - and anticipates the skepticism of a secular Western reader. I'm already in the choir, so no need to convince me of the not-self or of how sitting quietly on your butt for N minutes per day is valuable. If anything, I felt inspired to restart my own practice. I also really enjoyed - and was relieved by! - the reiteration of how HARD Buddhism is, since it goes contrary to our evolutionary drives. This actually aligns with ANOTHER book I'm reading about anxiety disorder as NOT maladaptations, but just outdated good-adaptations, that were evolutionarily beneficial and are now, in this post-industrial age, a bit of a liability. I would juxtapose this (and well, the New Yorker review juxtaposed these two books) against Stephen Batchelor's After Buddhism: Rethinking the Dharma for the Secular Age. Both books dive deep into Buddhism with the clear hope of making it palatable to a post-Judeo-Christian Western skeptic. Batchelor does this by, IMHO, cherry-picking canon and assuming the best of any ambiguous phrase - but, hey, at least he TRIES to tackle the gnarlier stuff like reincarnation (waaaaht) and how women will doom the dharma (womp womp). Wright avoids the gnarlier stuff with a basic thesis of deep pragmatism: yo, just throw out the stuff that doesn't make sense! Meditation makes sense and is helpful! Here's science to prove it! I'm fine with either/both. In style, Batchelor's writing was - hoo boy - a ponderous slog, whereas Wright was fun and easy to read (without sacrificing depth). Would I recommend this to a non-dharma friend? I'm not sure. I guess if someone was pretty keen on learning about Buddhism already, then, yes, this is a great intro. Take ye this and the Headspace app and go ye unto the mountain and, lo! I would probably not recommend the Batchelor book, since it's - well - kinda boring. If I wanted to slyly plant the seeds of Buddhism, I would do it the old-fashioned way: watching Keanu Reeves's oddly passable Indian accent (????) in Little Buddha. "
94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,Rating 4 out of 5,"Books on Buddhism range from the very accessible ... to the other extreme. Robert Wright's Why Buddhism Is True is written at a good level for me: building on ideas that I have read and considered before, but providing new perspectives on them.I feel at home with Buddhist philosophy, at least western versions of Buddhism. Why? Buddhism and psychology, cognitive therapy especially, are close siblings: both question the validity of our thoughts and feelings. As Wright observes, we are all deluded to greater or lesser degrees – which may not be a problem if that delusion doesn't hurt us or others, but is when they do. Cognitive therapy questions the validity of our thoughts and feelings by literally challenging their validity: ""Is it really true that you are nobody if he leaves you?"" Mindfulness meditation does this by carefully observing our thoughts and feelings, recognizing our delusions, and developing greater clarity about the nature of our world (e.g., that we are still worthwhile people even when our relationships do not continue). As he concludes:  We build stories on stories on stories, and the problem with the stories begins at their foundation. Mindfulness meditation is, among other things, a tool for examining our stories carefully, from the ground up, so that we can, if we choose, separate truth from fabrication. (Loc. 2282-2284).Neither cognitive therapy nor mindfulness meditations is a quick fix, however. Both require practice. And, as Wright observed, Another paradox of meditation: the problems that meditation can help you overcome [e.g., anxiety, lack of focus, depression, anger] often make it hard to meditate in the first place (Loc. 294).Wright weaves philosophy, psychology, and evolutionary biology together in interesting ways, finally concluding: There’s a lot to dislike about the world we’re born into. It’s a world in which, as the Buddha noted, our natural way of seeing, and of being, leads us to suffer and to inflict suffering on others. And it’s a world that, as we now know, was bound to be that way, given that life on this planet was created by natural selection. Still, it may also be a world in which metaphysical truth, moral truth, and happiness can align, and a world that, as you start to realize that alignment, appears more and more beautiful. (Loc. 3991-3995)Why Buddhism Is True was an interesting step on my stumbling journey to remove my blinders."
95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11595153-daniel-frank,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a good book with an important message.Wright's main thesis is that humans developed for the sole purpose of being more likely to replicate, (which has many negative externalities on our well being), and that meditation can help improve the quality of our life by overcoming feelings without merit such as anxiety, or silly desires.However, there are some issues with the book. Wright speaks in a conversational tone and tries to persuade the reader through being personal anecdotes, rather than strong empirical arguments. Wright also speaks about a very ambiguous form of buddhism, where he selects whatever strands he likes, discards whatever he doesn't like, and tries to formulate a coherent narrative of what buddhism actually is.There is another issue with the science. Most of this book is just citing interesting psychology studies, and Wright creating some sort of tie-in on how buddhism solves the issue the study raises. However, Wright fails to mention huge issues in the field, such as the replication crisis (p-hacking, the garden of forking paths etc) and badly mistakes what the literature actually says. Reference to priming shouldn't be used without serious qualifiers. I imagine Wright did this intentionally to make the book more interesting, but it's misleading. It's also unclear why Wright picks certain studies/points from a scientific perspective, but it's likely Wright included anything he thought people may find interesting, rather than what could advance his argument. There are also some strange omissions, such as discussion of the Triune brain when analyzing the self.While the book is very short, I think it's main points could have been expressed in a long article. In fact, this excerpt in the Wall Street Journal essentially offers just that: https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-medi...As a note - I read this book after completing a 10 day meditation retreat.

In my opinion each one of his previous books could qualify as a magnum opus in its own right. Each one influenced and astounded me profoundly. They were engaging. The ideas were presented so fluidly and were laid out with such thoughtful precision. My attention was captured on every page and after each chapter I was amazed at what I had learned and excited to hear what he'd serve up next. All of that with his personality shining through to make for a very delightful read. Now, that's a lot to live up to. I can't help but feel like this work is the equivalent to a later album of a band that got real big real fast- just not as good. How could he possibly continue to churn out consecutive masterpieces? For this reason, I don't blame the author for the two stars I've given this book. Perhaps it's just a law of nature. Like the experience of beginning meditation itself, I kind of felt like I was often anxiously awaiting the time when I could get up from my cushion and get on with other things all the while knowing that I should be focused on the pages in front of me for enlightenment. This book just seemed long-winded to me and it didn't offer many surges of pleasure ascribable to clever points or interesting presentation. Is it intentionally a bit dull to demonstrate that desiring that kind of pleasure is often met with disappointment? Stylistically this was clearly a more personal work, based on the author's personal experiences learning to meditate and exploring Buddhist ideas. It was part diary/ part evangelism/ with a much smaller sliver of academic wowing that I think he's managed to accomplish in his other works. Yet the voice that often came through was that of a droning academic speaking in a lecture hall to a daydreaming audience. Not that I don't think that all of his points weren't valid and true. But they probably could have been made in half as much space and time. "

Mindfulness meditation is, among other things, a tool for examining our stories carefully, from the ground up, so that we can, if we choose, separate truth from fabrication.”“We don't have to love our enemies, but seeing them clearly is essential.”“...it would be tragic, to say the least, if, after billions of years of arduous effort on the part of organic life, effort that has gotten us to the verge of a global community of minds, we let the natural distortions in these minds blow the whole thing apart.”I grew up with a Christian background. My parents were not practicing but my paternal grandparents were very religious and I was influenced by them and went to Sunday school for many years. As I have matured and my mind has expanded, as I have read industriously and studied the world, I have gotten further and further away from organized religion and may now, be considered, right of agnostic. Although, I won't say that out loud, due to God guilt, that is still ingrained in my soul.The one religion I do admire, more and more all the time, is Buddhism. It makes sense. It fits. I doubt I'll ever become a Buddhist, but there is no problem with following it's tenets, especially meditation.I tried meditating a couple years ago. I barely got started but did recognize the benefits. After reading this book, I may try to get back into it. I really liked this book and it's approach. Wright is a smart guy and completely grounded and gives the reader much to chew on and dwell over. His narrative style is easy and conversational and his has a good sense of humor, which really helps through some of the dry spots."
98,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26188-jafar,Rating 3 out of 5,"Wright tells you at the beginning of the book that by Buddhism he doesn’t mean the “real” Asian Buddhism, and at the end of the book he tells you that he doesn’t even consider himself a Buddhist. (I would not have read a book that talked about reincarnation or the various gods that Asian Buddhists believe in.) By Buddhism he basically means mindfulness meditation. When I read Sam Harris’s Waking Up I complained that Harris didn’t really explain how meditation can lead to the realization that the self is an illusion, and how this realization can lead to a better life. Wright does a very good job of explaining these points, although some may find his reliance on evolutionary psychology excessive and sometimes unjustifiable. In the end, I felt that Wright was overselling Buddhism. Buddhism deserves credit for the early insight into human condition, and meditation has proven benefits for stress and anxiety and other ills, but for the purpose of what this book is trying to promote, there’s no need to try to prove that “Buddhism is true” and fret over what Buddha said in what sermon and what exactly he meant by that. The claim that the self is an illusion can be supported by neuroscience or some plain reflection (how David Hume reached that conclusion). If you’re not happy with reaching this conclusion intellectually and want to actually experience loss of self or the boundaries of self expanding, take LSD once. And to have compassion for others and to not let your negative emotions grip you too tightly – yes, mindfulness meditation (or any other form of self-reflection) helps, but again, no need to read too much into Buddhism teachings. "
99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56801726-liz,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book could have been called “Why You Should Practice Mindfulness Meditation,” but that wouldn’t have been as catchy. The title, while bold, is apt insofar as the author astutely weaves together a lot of support from evolutionary biology and psychology for the proposition that we mostly lead lives obscured by illusions, and describes how meditation can help dispel them. We have certain emotional reactions, and assumptions about other people and the world, because these mental processes would have been adaptive (in terms of natural selection). These processes do not serve modern humans well, as we no longer live in the conditions for which we evolved. Buddhist meditation tackles these tendencies, and the illusions they create, head on, and thus offers the prospect of a more authentic, less conditioned (maybe even enlightened) life. This is not a how-to guide for meditation, but rather an extremely convincing argument for getting one (or, probably better yet, finding a teacher).The author’s tone throughout the book is engaging and casual, but also no-nonsense and thorough. He did his homework brilliantly on the science and the philosophy, and it shows. The book is sprinkled with anecdotes of his own struggles and successes with meditation; these are additive, not a distraction. This book changed the way I thought about the world in little ways and big ones, and has encouraged me to make space and time for meditation. "

Something I really enjoyed was how the author utilized his background in evolutionary psychology as a lens to further understand Buddhism Philosophy.It was also interesting learning how feelings can influence our thinking and behavior on an unconscious level and how achieving critical distance and perspective on these feelings can help you easier achieve control to how you may react. I also enjoyed learning more in depth about the fundamental attribution error and how complex it can be when applied to different instances between people. I also liked the personal anecdotes from the author of his experiences with meditation and enlightenment,and appreciated his admittance of his struggles with meditation and that he was by no means an expert on the subject. Overall this was a thought provoking and fairly informative read on mindfulness meditation through an evolutionary lens. “Making real progress in mindfulness meditation almost inevitably means becoming more aware of the mechanics by which your feelings,if left to their own devices,shape your perceptions , thoughts, and behavior-and becoming more aware of the things in your environment that activate those feelings in the first place.”"

Felt relatable- does point out that detachment does not necessarily lead to one being more moral by giving a couple of counter examples of detached people who were badCons:- Gives no compelling reason why an ""Enlightened"" person would disagree with Alexander Pope's nihilist maxim of ""Whatever is, is right"" - it sounds like someone who is completely detached from the world would also be completely accepting of the world as it is. Was not clear how mindfulness meditation cultivates good ""inner judgment"" which allows one to pick and choose the ""best"" thoughts that pop into one's head. Briefly mentions how the Buddha insisted on ""moral teachings"" to ground his disciples but does not go into the details.- I could easily see mindfulness meditation being used by armies to instill focus and ruthlessness into soldiers - it seems more like a tool to eliminate distractions rather than to promote goodness and empathy and charity- does not present competing evo psych theories to contrast with the ones that support his perspective (this is why I dislike evo psych generally; it seems like you can use it to support anything you like)- he is not a Buddhist so I don't trust his interpretations of its doctrine"

If you're making grand claims about something (not that you have to, it's fine to go along with something kind of mystical if it makes you happy and doesn't harm anyone), then you should be rigorous about it, and there's some big holes and unexamined avenues here. If by meditating you're neutralising the unhelpful naturally-selected-for mind modules, allowing you to perceive the oneness/emptiness of the universe, what module is it that's left that's doing this perceiving, and how come it evolved to do that? What about free will? (Not that I really wanted to read another chapter about free will, but it seems weird it wasn't there for me to skip OF MY OWN VOLITION.) Also, it felt very strange to read such an uncritical presentation of evolutionary psychology theories in this day and age.If you're going to read a book about Buddhism from a scientific viewpoint, I'd start with Susan Blackmore's

Clearly I find the material highly engaging! Wright is a psychologist, specifically an evolutionary psychologist, with a career-long interest in the role of religion in individual psychology and shared culture. His project here is to look at how the claims of Buddhism about how the mind operates stack up against modern scientific evidence. No spoiler- it is in the title of the book!- he finds that Buddha had insights about how the mind works, specifically about the role of attachment and aversion in creating suffering and about the relationship between cognition and emotion, that align with our best modern scientific understanding. One theme I found particularly useful is his exploration of how the ways our brains evolved to get genes into the next generation is misaligned with the environment we are currently living in, and how being conscious of that can help us make wiser choices. Highly recommended. Whether or not you have any interest in Buddhism this book is packed with ideas that are both fascinating and useful."

So the book should have been titled Why Mindful Meditation Might Help You Like It Does Me. When we get to the end and the Appendix right when my head is spinning from not really having any more in depth understanding of Buddhist beliefs than when I started, he fixes that in a rundown of Buddhist beliefs and justification of the title. Nope. Still not buying what you're selling Mr. I Tell You Multiple Times How Stubborn And Resistant I Am So If I Can Meditate, So Can You, completely negating the Buddhist philosophy of nonself. I just don't know where to go with this. Using Natural Selection, Einstein's Theory of Relativity, neuroscience and psychology to help understand Buddhism was about to be brilliant. But it wasn't.

It's a great book, explaining why Buddhist teachings are true and why it's important to apply them in our lives. So many people just follow blindly our programming without ever thinking about why they do certain things. This a groundbreaking book because it's written by an important scholar. The happy clappy flower power image of meditation is the reason why a lot of people dismisses it. This book, however, is a deliberation on meditation from a more scientific point of view. It's not overly scientific, though. On the contrary, it let's an average reader understand why we behave the way we do from the perspective of evolutionary psychology and how to become more mindful about our behaviors. The author's personal experiences additionally enhance the book. I don't remember when was the last time I read something so relatable. I hope many people will read it and start meditating."

Follow on to Richard Feynmann ( not fooling yourself-because you are the easiest person to fool), Matt Ridley (The Red Queen-Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature). Got serious about meditation after finishing the book. The Jodo Shin Buddhism I learned as a child, taught that we are all diamonds in the rough. The diamond is revealed and shines through meditation. An opposite starting point from original sin. Meditation is behavior modification for your subconscious. Feelings lead to thoughts, thoughts lead to behaviors and action. The problem comes because feelings change, and conflicting thoughts lead to irrational behaviors and actions.Humans are social, survival/propagation of genes is enhanced by group interactions aka tribes and gangs.

The author does have a lot of good and interesting things to say about psychology and neuroscience, although I could've done without some of the evolutionary psychology. However, when it came to actually discussing religious or philosophical questions, which is what this book is ostensibly about, the author demonstrated that religion and philosophy are definitely not his primary fields to say the least. Parts of this book honestly felt very colonial, in that the author wants to take from Buddhism the things that he likes, that he can fit into his own philosophical worldview (which he just assumes to be true without argument or discussion), but then feels free to jettison the metaphysical and philosophical claims of the religion that he is trying to plunder for his own therapeutic ends.

Wright does seem to fall into the trap of Buddhist exceptionalism - he seems to pick and choose select Buddhist doctrines to engage with while promising readers to stay away from anything ""too exotically metaphysical"". Heh. That aside, this was definitely worth the read!! It focused on mindfulness meditation and gave a broad overview of the psychology and philosophy behind the naturalistic parts of Buddhism.

126,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2490942-david,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book might be better named, “A Skeptic’s Exploration of Buddhism”. The author, a veteran writer and thinker on Natural Selection, explores the domain of meditation and mindfulness, and finds enrichment. The book starts out as something of a travel guide of his journey, but develops into something of a study of three threads—Buddhist philosophy, Natural Selection, and cognitive science—and how they commingle. The book has some quirky twists of presentation that took it down a notch for me, but there are some stellar observations and compelling thoughts. I had to interact with this book; I took a lot of notes and reworked them. Here’s how I put it together, and what I want to remember and continue pondering.A major premise of this study is that our perception of reality is often illusory. Natural Selection didn’t design your mind to see the world clearly or to see reality as it is. It designed your mind to have perceptions and beliefs that would help your genes to propagate. Our mechanism for cognition is not always straightforward or accurate. A simple case in point: after we are acclimated to pleasure, the brain anticipates it, releasing dopamine just prior to when the stimulus is introduced. As it turns out then, in Pavlovian style, we get more pleasure from the anticipation of stimulus that the stimulus itself. So it follows that our experience of pleasure may very well be based on illusion. Knowing this doesn’t necessarily change it, but still, if you want to liberate yourself from the parts of the mind that keeps you from realizing true happiness, you have to first become aware of how that deception occurs. But knowing the truth about your situation doesn’t necessarily break the cycle of ultimately futile pleasure seeking (the hedonic treadmill) or pain avoidance. So the truth won’t set you free, but you may not be able to free yourself without knowing the truth.Ideally, you should subject your feelings to investigation, inspecting them to see which ones deserve obedience and which ones don’t, and try to free yourself from the grip of ones that don’t. It is difficult because it is in the nature of feelings to make it hard to tell the valuable ones from the harmful ones, the reliable ones from the misleading. They actively discourage you from viewing them objectively. We don’t actually control the most fundamental aspect of our mental life—what we’re thinking about. “Thoughts think themselves”, which is one reason it is hard to mediate very long without our thoughts drifting off. Yet we cling to thoughts, emotions, and other elements as if they were personal belongings. Liberation consists of changing the relationship between your consciousness and the things you normally think of as the contents of you consciousness—your feelings, your thoughts, and so on. Once you realize that these things are “not self”, the relationship of your consciousness to them becomes more like contemplation than engagement, and your consciousness is liberated. This notion may sound like hippie nonsense at first blush, but bringing in threads from Natural Selection and cognitive science gives it substance and credibility.“Feelings are designed by Natural Selection to represent judgments about things, evaluations of them. Natural Selection ‘wants’ you to experience things as either good or bad. [This is a crucial point that extends to my theory about binary proclivities in human behavior, and warrants deeper study.] The Buddha believed that the less you judge things, including the contents of your mind, the more clearly you’ll see them and the less diluted you’ll be.” The conscious mind is naturally diluted about its own nature. “Beneficence” (beneficial and effective) is how people represent themselves to the world. “People think they are morally above average. This is an especially important piece of self-flattery, because it helps fuel the self-righteousness that starts and sustains conflicts, ranging from quarrels to wars.” So we are under two forms of illusions: the first is the nature of the conscious self, which we see as more in control of things than it actually is. The second is the illusion about what kind of people we are (i.e., capable and upstanding). Jerome Barko: “It is possible to argue that the primary evolutionary function of the self is to be the organ of impression management, rather than, as our folk psychology would have it, a primary decision maker.” So if we are not decision makers, then how do decisions get made? Evolutionary psychology is building a theory that the mind is modular, that the mind is composed of lots of specialized modules for sizing up situations and reacting to them. It is the interplay among these modules that shapes your behavior (much of which you are unaware). Split brain experiments show that people are capable of convincing themselves of whatever stories about their own motivation is in their interest (as defined by natural selection) to tell others. In mating mode, a module takes control of the mind when people are in the presence of a potential mate they find attractive, and causes them to act in a prescribed manner that is different, and perhaps contradictory, than when they are in another module. Kendrick, et al, came up with seven modules (or sub-selves) with the following mission: self-protection, mate attraction and mate retention, affiliation, making and keeping friends, kin care, social status, and disease avoidance. You act differently when in each module. One of the ideas behind mindfulness meditation is that gaining a critical distance from your feelings can give you more control over modules, or control of which “you” is “you” at any given moment.Feelings are, among other things, the minds way of assigning priority labels to thoughts. When we decide to do something, we decide on the basis of a feeling. As Hume put it, “Reason alone can never be a motive to any action of the will.” Buying something ultimately comes down to feeling good about the purchase. Otherwise, given two equal choices, we might never make a decision. Natural Selection may have favored a strong role for feelings in decision making, resulting in feelings commanding more control in decision making than that of rational evidence-based reasoning.Fundamental Attribution Error. “Attribution” refers to the tendency to explain people’s behavior in terms of either Dispositional Factors (the kind of person they are) or Situational Factors (the circumstances they are in). “Error” refers to the fact that these attributions are often wrong, that we tend to underestimate the role of situation and overestimate the role of disposition. Gilbert Harmon, after reviewing the literature on FAE raised questions about the very existence of such character traits as honest, benevolence, and friendliness. “Since it is possible to explain our ordinary belief in character traits as deriving from certain illusions, we must conclude that there is no empirical basis for the existence of character traits. “ We tend, then, to think of our own indiscretions as based on Situational Factors, that it wasn’t the “real me” that did that. But with other people’s indiscretions, we’re more likely to attribute to Dispositional Factors. Herbert C. Kelman noted how fundamental attribution keeps enemies on the enemy list. Attribution mechanisms promote confirmation of the original enemy image. Hostile actions by the enemy are attributed Dispositionally, thus providing further evidence of the enemy’s aggressive implacable character. Conciliatory actions are explained away as reactions to situational forces. Buddhist philosophy consists largely of taking the idea of causality seriously. What we tend to think of as “the self” is in such constant causal interaction with and influenced by its environment, as to raise doubts about how firmly the boundaries of the self really are. The various things that we think of as our self are not, in fact, under our control. The reason they are not under our control is that they are under the control of outside forces, forces that set off chain reactions inside us, and activate reactive behavior modules. The path of meditative progress is to become aware of the causes that impinge on you, aware of the way things manipulate you. This is the place where mindfulness can critically intervene, and bring the power to break, or at least loosen, the chains. You become more aware of what causes what. You are not making judgments—that is, not mindlessly labeling your feelings as bad or good, not fleeing from them or rushing to embrace them. You can get close to them without getting lost in them. You are then in a better position to engage your rational faculties and decide which ones are good guiding lights. What “not making judgments” means is “not letting your feelings make judgments for you.” What “getting in touch with your feelings” means is “not being so oblivious to them that you get push around by them.” “All of this means informing your responses to the world with the clearest possible view of the world.” This is a highly mechanistic conception of how the mind works. If you understand the workings of the machine, you are better positioned to rewire it, to subvert its programing, to alter its responses to the causes that impinge on it. Wright recognizes that the machine was programed by Natural Selection; it is not a perfectly functioning gift from the divine, not a blank slate. It is a pre-wired mechanism that was jury-rigged to serve a survival purpose in a different environmental circumstance than those we encounter today, and now we are using it to a different purpose, unaware of its pre-programmed biases and glitches, unaware that we are captured by it and that it distorts the picture of reality it transmits to us.Wright confesses that he was motivated to write the book in hopes of helping erode the biases of tribalism. He identifies an embarrassing irony: “Nothing so arouses tribalistic animosities in me as people who support policies that, in my view, tend to arouse tribalistic animosities.” He makes an interesting but subtle point: “I wouldn’t want to travel so far down the path toward nirvana that I was drained of fighting spirit. If being full of enlightenment means you quit making value judgments of any kind and quit pushing for change, then count me out. But believe me when I tell you that getting to that point in the path is not, for me at least, a looming peril. The question is whether I can get far enough down the path to conduct my ideological combat with these people wisely and truthfully. Which, in turn, means viewing them more objectively, and in a sense, more generously than I’m naturally inclined to do.” He believes that it would indeed be a tragedy if we let the natural distortions of the mind take the world down, and that it would be all the more tragic in light of the fact that these distortions are now a scientifically established fact, and that we have ways of correcting them (including meditative practice). “The means to the planet’s salvation is at hand.”  "
127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5917720-gordon,Rating 4 out of 5,"The book description is a good start. No need to say more on summarizing. I did listen as audio book. It was well read. The material was for the most part review of concepts I am familiar with through other reading/listening and practice of mindfulness meditation and evolutionary psychology. One area that provoked some thought was in discussion of, in my mind, developing my model of our brain structure and consciousness. I’m wondering if we have any insight into whether some of the unconscious “voices/thoughts” that emerge and are presented to our consciousness are in competition for our awareness in part originating from different sides of our bilateral hemisphere brain structure. Are there any physically asymmetric regions of the brain that would serve as the central adjudicator/gatekeeper to awareness. It inspired me to dive into some chatGPT “research” to expand my understanding of brain structure and theories of consciousness. But that’s a different topic. The important point here is that this book drive done of that curiosity. One area I was frustrated with in this presentation was in the authors coverage of the Buddha’s discourse/sutra on not-self. While I came to accept that he was trying to stick to the common interpretation of the discourse, and perhaps the traditional outcome suggesting that “there is no self”, I found it frustrating that the interpretation he was suggesting was missing a key distinction. While the Buddha, it seems to me, was properly saying, no your body is not your Self, and your feelings are not your Self and your thoughts are not your Self etc … therefore there is no self, missed that he wasn’t saying there is nothing else … but that the things we might expect the Self to come from are not it. It doesn’t mean that we don’t and he didn’t recognize that clearly there is some other underlying essence/entity/construct that, while not a CEO, directing it awareness that we interpret of self, but the unconscious/subconscious is a necessary part of our being. Anyway, it was driving me nuts that the author, or perhaps the Buddha, never acknowledged this and had let the reader and perhaps all of Buddhist thinkers to go away thinking that there is no self. Clearly, in a mindfulness practice it is a useful practice when observing our intruding thoughts or sensations to investigate from where they arise, and find we have no answer. My second criticism is that the third quarter of this book does drone on for quite an unbearable while in the concepts of essence, emptiness etc. while the author warned the readers from the outset that Buddhism involves thinking through and around a variety of paradoxi, I’m not sure it served him well to dwell for such a long time trying to work us through and over some of these borderline mystical metaphysical topics. I and he did come around to make for a stronger finish. Refocusing on the practical benefits of mindfulness to individuals and potentially society. And I appreciated his appendix where he reviewed point by point the claims he believes the elements of Buddhist thought are well supported by modern neuro-science and evolutionary psychology research and results. All good stuff. Well written. Well read. Just requires some mindful patience to get through the middle. …"
128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40859577-dunigan,Rating 4 out of 5,"I like Robert Wright and think he has one of the most under-appreciated podcasts/youtube channels in the history of the world (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyXh...), so I was predisposed to like this book. Unsurprisingly, I really enjoyed it.First, it's probably worth mentioning that Wright isn't arguing that the more mystical/religious aspects of Buddhism are true. Instead, he's arguing for the validity of the more secular aspects of Buddhism (namely, the benefits of meditation). It seems to be a law of catchy book titles that the catchier the title, the longer the author has to spend explaining what exactly the title really means.I was a little worried this book would have the same issues as other books in the ""hey look! this theory/religion/worldview is actually corroborated by science!"" genre. Mainly, the tendency to cherry pick a few neurological and psychological studies with less than 30 participants and pretend that these results are indisputable facts of nature. In reality, a few under-powered studies from the late 90's should do very little to move anyone's prior beliefs on whatever the topic of the book is. Now, obviously there will be some ""cherry picking"" in the sense that the authors will present research that is relevant to their thesis, but it bothers me when they don't accompany the results with at least a little caveat when necessary. To this end, I think Wright struck a nice balance between providing scientific evidence that backs up his claims, while also noting where the jury is still out on some of the conclusions. For example, he provided a few caveats when discussing Benjamin Libet's 1983 study potentially suggesting that 'free will is an illusion, man', the conclusions of which have been hotly debated.I was also worried that this book would fall prey to another issue that plagues similar books—that .0001% of the book would be actual substance and 99.9999% of the book would be charming anecdote. Wright again strikes a nice balance here. He tells stories about his own experiences with meditation, but these stories are not aggressively frequent, and given that this is a book largely trying to describe subjective experience, the stories are pretty helpful.Probably my only gripe with the book is that Wright occasionally plays a little fast and loose with the evolutionary ""just so"" stories. I completely agree with Wright that the evolutionary perspective on human psychology has all kinds of explanatory power, but I think sometimes he too freely throws around post-hoc evolutionary justifications for our psychology. It's not that I don't think the aspects of psychology he was trying to explain are the result of evolution. It's just that it's pretty easy to toss around reasonable conjectures for why an aspect of our psychology was adaptive, when in reality it's probably more complicated than our simplistic ""just so"" story.Overall, if you have a passing interest in Buddhism—and meditation specifically—this book is worth the read."
129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10293618-simon,Rating 2 out of 5,"It seems rather obvious when you think about it but in my experience many meditators overlook the connection between evolutionary psychology and Buddhist philosophy. On a “secular” Vipassana retreat I went to, the teacher used an example of a cat waiting to pounce on a mouse. He said that the cat had concentration but not wisdom, supposedly because it was about to harm another sentient being. In other words, the cat was not displaying the right type of mindfulness. Of course in strictly evolutionary and biological terms, this makes no sense as cats are obligate carnivores. In a similar vein, I find that Buddhist philosophy and teachings mischaracterize feelings and thoughts as “defilement” and “impurities” of the human mind. Why Buddhism is True points out that when viewed from an evolutionary angle, our tendency to suffer unnecessarily by being lost in thought and being reactive to emotions actually makes perfect sense. We were “designed” to propagate our genes, not to be in perpetual bliss. Wright’s main argument is that meditation is great because it help us cut through our delusions and realize experiential truths about the nature of our minds. I think the evolutionary psychology angle that is presented in this book is an important piece of the puzzle in the pursuit of secular spirituality. It moves the conversation away from permanently attaining liberation, enlightenment, Nirvana, Nibbana or whatever you want to call it to how we can make the most of our limited time given what we know about our nature. It muddies the water by showing that even Buddha who was prescient about so many things, couldn’t have seen the real source of our misery. And no, we’re not gonna suddenly solve all our problems if everyone started meditating.That being said, I could not stand the author’s writing style. I think the book would have benefited tremendously if Wright organized his ideas better and didn’t ramble so much. He also seems to be under the delusion that he can get away with talking about himself ad nauseum as long as he establishes a mutual fondness of sugar powdered doughnuts with his readers. The fact that I managed to finish this book might be a testament to the efficacy of meditation. "

Even if you're not into meditation, there's still a lot of valuable insights in here that may just prompt you into giving meditation a try. If you are already someone who meditates regularly, this book is a truly wonderful resource to provide lots of logical, well-grounded explanations for why the human mind works the way it does, in the context of evolutionary history and natural selection, explaining how some mechanisms of thought that served a survival advantage in previous phases of our species' existence, are now obsolete and cause extensive suffering that is totally avoidable. So, this will give you lots of context and reinforcement for some of the emotions and thought processes that you are putting under the microscope in the course of meditation and a life of mindfulness in general.One bone to pick that I can't let go is that the title is awful--very misleading and makes it sound like ""Buddism is the one true religion and all tenets of its belief system are correct."" The thing is, Robert Wright very quickly up front stipulates with caveats as to why this book is absolutely not that..he just means that a lot (but not all) of what Buddhism teaches and recommends actually IS true if you put it under scientific/philosophical scrutiny using knowledge/methods that were not available when the actual Buddha lived/taught. But...giving it that title was foolish because a lot of people (rightfully so) may have a dismissive reaction and not even give it a chance just because of the title...I only came around to this book after hearing the author talk about it at length on Sam Harris' podcast (in fact I ordered it on Amazon that very night)."
131,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64785453-andrei-khrapavitski,Rating 4 out of 5,"Finished listening to an audio version of Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment, the latest book by Robert Wright, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of Bloggingheads.tv. Wright has written on the topic of religion quite a bit. I remember some of his interviews with so called “new atheists” and his public disagreements with some of their views. He himself was brought up religiously, as a Southern Baptist, but abandoned his faith in teenage years after comparing the theory of natural selection with the Book of Genesis as accounts of how humans came to be. Later in life he described himself as a secular humanist. So I thought this book would be interesting. I can’t say I was disappointed even though I had previously read some other authors on similar topics. It’s worth mentioning Spirituality without Religion by Sam Harris and 10% Happier by Dan Harris. To add to that, some modern philosophers like Derek Parfit or even David Benatar have some insights clearly borrowed from Buddhist teachings. None of the above claimed that Buddhism was true. How will Wright attempt to do that? Spoiler alert: he doesn’t. What he argues for is a western version of secular Buddhism which is stripped of supernatural claims like the belief in reincarnation. Wright cherrypicks those parts which do not contradict modern science. Some of those “truths” are listed in the appendix to the book. So here are some of them:Human beings often fail to see the world clearly, and this can lead them to suffer and to make others suffer. This costly misapprehension of the world can assume various forms, described in various ways in different Buddhist texts.Humans tend to anticipate more in the way of enduring satisfaction from the attainment of goals than will in fact transpire. This illusion, and the resulting mindset of perpetual aspiration, makes sense as a product of natural selection, but it’s not exactly a recipe for lifelong happiness.Dukkha is a relentlessly recurring part of life as life is ordinarily lived. This fact is less evident if you translate dukkha as it’s conventionally translated—as “suffering” pure and simple—than if you translate it as involving a big component of “unsatisfactoriness.” Organisms, including humans, are designed by natural selection to react to their environments in ways that will make things “better” (in natural selection’s sense of the term). This means they are almost always, at some level, scanning the horizon for things to be unhappy about, uncomfortable with, unsatisfied with. And since being unsatisfied, by definition, involves at least a little suffering, thinking of dukkha as entailing unsatisfactoriness winds up lending credence to the idea that dukkha in the sense of suffering is a pervasive part of life. Our intuitive conception of the “self” is misleading at best. We tend to uncritically embrace all kinds of thoughts and feelings as “ours,” as part of us, when in fact that identification is optional. Recognizing that the identification is optional and learning, through meditation, how to make the identification less reflexive can reduce suffering. An understanding of why natural selection engineered various feelings into the human mind can help validate the idea that we shouldn’t uncritically accept the guidance of our feelings and can help us choose which feelings to accept guidance from. The more expansive and more common interpretation of the Buddha’s second discourse—as saying that the “self” simply doesn’t exist—is rendered in various ways in various Buddhist texts. A common rendering—that there is no CEO self, no self that is the “doer of deeds,” the “thinker of thoughts”—is substantially corroborated by modern psychology, which has shown the conscious self to be much less in charge of our behavior than it seems to be. A number of psychologists, including in particular evolutionary psychologists, subscribe to a “modular” model of the mind that is quite consistent with this view that there is no CEO self. This model can help explain a common apprehension of advanced meditators: that “thoughts think themselves.”This is not the full list of “truths.” If you find the ideas compelling, this might be the right book for you. As Wright put it, if you want the shortest version of my answer to the question of why Buddhism is true, it’s this: Because we are animals created by natural selection. Natural selection built into our brains the tendencies that early Buddhist thinkers did a pretty amazing job of sizing up, given the meager scientific resources at their disposal. Now, in light of the modern understanding of natural selection and the modern understanding of the human brain that natural selection produced, we can provide a new kind of defense of this sizing up.I haven’t been to any silent meditation retreats. But I do meditate once in a while. I have found that in some situations this practice has helped me personally. I wouldn’t go as far as to claim that Buddhism was true. But I think it is fascinating how such an old philosophy has got so many aspects of our existence right. Even if you take reincarnation, which Wright doesn’t believe in, just think about it from a scientific perspective. In what way could this actually happen? Remember that according to Buddhist teachings self is an illusion. So the question is what gets reincarnated? If it is all about the repurposing of matter you’re made of, then this is pretty much true. The vast majority of atoms that make up your body are billions years old. Some of them will end up as part of other living organisms. It won’t be you, yes. But Buddhism teaches us that we are much less of separate entities as we would like to think. We are much more of a chain reaction propagated by entropy. These forces are eternal, as there are probably infinite numbers of universes, big bangs. The cycle of life will most probably continue with a good chance that somewhere in spacetime there are other living organisms having the same thoughts and even essentially the same bodies as you. Maybe in some advanced civilizations a reincarnation is nothing but an upload of your consciousness from one unit of hardware to another. But you don’t even have to go that far. Leaving reincarnation aside, secular Buddhism is, IMHO, psychology with a religious flavor. I wish all modern religions were as benevolent and beneficial. Maybe this is where all major religions are eventually going. If so, this is not too bad. What is depressing is how long this road is and how much more suffering and death will result from diligent but thoughtless reading of religious doctrines."

Moreover, do not be deterred by the short title, ""Why Buddhism is True,"" but on the ladder, ""The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment,"" which, in my humble opinion, is a more accurate title. I plan on reading Stillness Is the Key next. ॐ"

The book explores mindfulness meditation and parts of Buddhism that can be applied even in secular space, as Blinklist's summary states: Buddhism and its advice is largely supported by science. By practicing mindfulness, meditation, and reframing our thinking – key tenets of Buddhism whose effectiveness are backed by psychology and neurology – we can improve our relationship to the world and enjoy the more peaceful existence so many of us crave"".I have been practicing mindfulness meditation myself - using Waking Up for almost a year now -, I have convinced many of my friends to cultivate a regular practice and we're reaping some remarkable benefits that range from having remarkable equanimity in general, living in the present moment, increased ability to focus regardless of what we are doing, not carried away by our emotions but having a high self-awareness of them, improvement in the relationship with ourselves and others, having more mental clarity, to be aware of our triggers and be less and less reactive to them to name few. Thanks to mindfulness meditation (and Bullet Journal) I'm in my best state of emotional/mental health yet in the last decade.Note: I read Blinklist's summary of book+relevant chapters to me."

Eléggé mélységében, mégis érthetően vázolja fel a keleti világszemléletet, melléje rakja az emberi természet működését az evolúciós szempontok és programok fényében, és hogy a világ megtapasztalásának illuziója hogyan változik „valósággá”. Ha a könyv elején még a Mátrix a buddhizmus kifejeződése lehetett, a végére eljutunk annak megértéséhez, miért nem az mégsem, miben különbözik nagyon is a koncepció.Eddig voltak ellenérveim és fenntartásaim jó pár buddhista elgondolással, olybá tűnt, mint amikor az ember bekap egy nyugtatót, és azzal megoldja problémáit, az üresség és az éntelenség teljesen más benyomást és gondolatokat keltett eddig bennem, de a könyv elolvasása során a mélyebb megértéssel ezek újabb és tartalmasabb választ kaptak, és most már értem, hogyan és miért járható, egészséges út, és mennyire korántsem arról van szó, hogy akkor homokba dugom a fejem és „nem érzek” semmit a világban járva-kelve.(A könyv második felét sokkal lényegesebbnek éreztem, érdemes eljutni a végéig.)"
136,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7629980-david-niose,Rating 4 out of 5,"Nice overview of how many concepts of Buddhism square well with more recent knowledge gained from evolutionary psychology. I think Wright is a bit guilty of trying to oversell his thesis as he struggles to explain some Buddhist concepts as arguably ""true"" (not self and emptiness, for example), and he does so only by playing with semantics, which of course is common in philosophical and theological writings. I was also uncomfortable with his loose use of language in some places, such where he says ""the values of natural selection's value system"" are ""false."" He makes a valid point that natural selection has left humans with feelings and impulses that are undesirable (and other problems as well, most of which can be remedied with the clarity gained from mindfulness meditation), but these points and others like them could have been made without presenting natural selection in a way that suggests it is some kind of doctrine that offers a ""false"" value system. Natural selection just is - period. But these quibbles aside, a really informative and enjoyable book."

For instance, he says he’s not crazy about “metta” practice. I feel the same way, but also, like the author, recognize its value in softening our otherwise harsh and unfair appraisal of others.I’ve been looking for a book like this, one that addresses the intersection of Buddhist ideas and modern psychology. I think the author does a good job of linking Buddhist insights to scientific discoveries, although he does inject his own opinions when the science is not quite definitive. Much of psychology still depends on self reporting and subjective measures, and studies that are remarkably narrow in their focus, so I’m always on the lookout for conclusions based on brain imaging results. Wright references several of these throughout the book.The appendix, “A List of Buddhist Truths,” is a helpful compendium of claims that Wright believes are corroborated by science.The book is well written, in a conversational tone, that is reminiscent of Michael Pollan’s “How to Change Your Mind.”"

If I were new to the practice, or confused about some of the philosophy surrounding Buddhism and meditation, I think it would have been quite useful. (Wright's thoughts on the psychology of emptiness were particularly interesting).Although Wright writes clearly, many passages were so casual that they felt almost sloppy or rushed. There were many instances where his informal tone seemed out of place given the topics at hand. That said, I'd still recommend this book to anyone new to the practice of meditation, or to any meditators who still believe in the self or free will."

I have been part of a similar silent meditative retreat many years ago and I was fascinated. If you go really deep you can find some awesome insights about your being and the world surrounding you, you can bend spoons and see another reality. I enjoyed listening to the book as it brought me to new or familiar places; even more, it inspired me for more mindfulness again as I was meditating a lot last year. However, there was too much Buddist's stuff, deep philosophical questions about nothingness, etc which I found vague and uninteresting. Maybe for those who are into Buddism, that won't be the case :-) "

The science is rather light and Wright takes Buddhism in very broad strokes (so it's more an exploration of Western Buddhism than Buddhism proper), but the book as a whole is enjoyable, motivating, and a great reminder that intentionally putting on different lenses when examining the world is an effective way to find truth, identify your own blind spots, and discover interesting alignments across disciplines."
141,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4873736-keith,Rating 3 out of 5,"Let me start with my long rant on Buddhism and meditation, then I’ll get to my brief review. Like most Western seekers, I’ve read a multitude of books on Buddhism and Eastern Religion by a variety of authors whose names I no longer recall. I get it: Desire and life in general are filled with suffering, we must let go of suffering and that path is to be maintained. Well, I “get it” in the sense that I intellectually understand it in a broad sense. I haven’t spent decades in monkish contemplation of it. I’m also convinced that meditation is, for the most part, good for a person’s well-being. As is regular exercise, a healthy diet, doing community service, having a vibrant network of friends, doing work you feel passionate about, feeling gratitude, practicing positive self-talk, reducing the number of things you own, giving back to the community, jogging, tantric sex, turning off the TV/smartphone, petting a dog, exploring nature, fasting, getting eight hours of sleep a night, praying, reading, recycling, dancing, playing a musical instrument, automatic writing, psychotherapy, visualization, doing a Super Hero pose – need I go on? There are a LOT of things that we’re told will improve our sense of well-being, and I’m sure they do. But the payoff from any of them is small. They help like talking half an aspirin for a headache helps. So there is inevitably disappointment, frustration and a feeling of failure if one expects a life-transforming experience. Enter meditation. Meditation often comes with extravagant promises far beyond the benefits of those things listed above (except, perhaps, prayer), from control of one’s emotions/mind to inner peace to cessation of pain and even enlightenment. Life transformation is always a teaser at the edge of a conversation about meditation. But does it transform lives? Is there a subspecies of super humans walking among us who have experienced life-transforming enlightenment as the result of meditation? Or is the sum of its accomplishments making one a little less irritable, so we’re left with a coterie of Joes and Josephines who are less angry about the bus being late? Drinking less coffee in the morning might yield the same result for most people. So I approach Buddhism, and meditation in particular, with a fair amount of skepticism and many questions: •	Does meditation make people better? (i.e., more full of loving kindness?)•	Does it make people significantly happier or provide a significantly improved sense of well-being? •	How truly effective and unbiased have been all the glowing reports on meditation? •	Does it allow one to control his/her emotions? Can a meditation expert exert control over his or her mind to remove negative thoughts and emotions? •	Does it allow one to “turn off” pain – physical and emotional?•	Does enlightenment even exist?•	Is meditation truly benign? Are there no negative effects? •	Does meditation, destruction of the “self” and acceptance of the world as it is remove the desire to improve one’s condition or the world?•	Does it dampen one’s passions, such as feelings for a loved one or pursuit of an art? •	If the purpose of life is to sit around all day in mind-emptying solitude, then what’s the point of being alive? So, uh, what was I doing here? Oh, a book review. I admire Robert Wright and I’ve read a number of his other books (perhaps all of them). He asks many of the same questions about life that I do. In this book, he analyzes the “secular,” non-miraculous practice of Buddhism and meditation through the lens of evolutionary psychology and determines that Buddhism is “true” in that it is built on a solid evolutionary foundation, and it offers people a solution to the anxiety and depression we all feel at times as a result of evolution. I don’t necessarily disagree with Wright’s analysis, but the book is too pleading, it tries too hard to make the case. And it was too soft. It didn’t answer any of my core questions about Buddhism and meditation. Questions about the authenticity of “enlightenment” were skirted around. I’m skeptical of people confusing how things ought to be with how they are, and most meditation gurus fall into this category. I would have preferred a much tougher, much more skeptical evaluation. And maybe that’s just not this book. As Wright correctly observes, we’ve answered or approached answers to many key questions on man’s motives and even meaning through natural selection and evolutionary psychology. And the answers are not always pleasant. We are selfish creatures, actively trying to delude others and ourselves, struggling with emotions and urges developed thousands of years ago for a much different environment. Evolution doesn’t care about our happiness or well-being. Heck, we’re not even the point of evolution, our genes are. Evolutionary psychology helps us understand our world and our minds, but provides no moral guidance. How to live in this world is the next question, and I think Wright is trying here to give us a viable, positive option to lead our lives. Though I trust him, I just can’t buy into all the promise of Buddhism and meditation. Not yet. If you have Buddhist leanings, and enjoy meditation, you will probably enjoy this book. If you are more skeptical, this will intrigue you but I don’t think it will convince you. End note: This blog by John Horgan actually gets closer to the approach I’m looking for and my questions (but maybe with less snark): https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/..."

Although he seems ""further along"" in the process, it was enjoyable to read accounts of experiences that are similar to my own. I've had a transformative experience with my own practice, but I've tempered the evangelical zeal I've felt with the concern that what I've experienced may be particular to me. Reading Wright's account, and the scientific evidence he includes, gives me a bit more confidence that meditation can be broadly beneficial.It may be that seeing transformational effects just requires a bit higher commitment that I previously supposed. Retreats seem to provide a depth of insight not possible just with a daily practice, and daily sessions in excess of 30 minutes appear to provide accelerating returns.Not a manual for beginning a meditation practice, but a good argument to start one."

He also covers the effects Buddhism has on the individual both emotional and otherwise. There are a lot of interesting concepts here that listen just once didn’t soak in for me.

In contrast to other books I've read on Buddhism from a western perspective, Wright provides a refreshing insight and dispenses with the aura of mysticism that can be so off-putting. Paradoxes are explained patiently and without pretence. Overall, a contemporary reification of ancient ideas and necessary appeal to champion objective clarity over the false idol of emotion and feelings. Borrowing as Wright does from the Bible: ""first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the spec out of your neighbour's eye""."

He clearly outlines how the practice of mindful meditation can assist in under standing how our mind works and why we feel and think the way we do.The main criticism leveled at this book and one that I would agree with is that it does cherry pick aspects of Buddhism to analyse and criticise. It is more of a investigation of mindfulness rather than full Buddhism as it glosses over much of the moral teaching of the practice.I still feel this is a interesting read.

156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1627591-robert,Rating 4 out of 5,"Why Buddhism is True by Robert Wright hinges on the point of evolutionary psychology as he and others understand it: all life forms seek to perpetuate their DNA, i.e., survive so that they can procreate. This means that human beings in the 21st century carry within them distinct and powerful feelings about their needs for mates, for allies, for food and shelter, for a good reputation...and for children. And these feelings--which Wright proposes drive us more forcefully than our rationality--tend to distort our perceptions, leading to the suffering caused by jealousy, envy, greed, gluttony, fears large and small, and what is loosely called tribalism, as evident on the nightly news or your favorite website, to the detriment of humanity as a whole.This is a somewhat choppy book because tying evolutionary psychology to Buddhism takes a lot of work. Fortunately, Wright's take on Buddhism is what he calls ""naturalistic."" He focuses in particular on the ways in which meditation clarifies one's relationship to a host of Darwinian states of mind that pressure and stress us. He offers numerous personal anecdotes based on his experiences in meditation, but he does not present himself as an enlightened being speaking ex cathedra. To the contrary, meditation is a struggle for him; there are more misses than hits. And yet his experience and the experiences of others cause him to argue that a meditation practice can render one more objective, less reactive, calmer, of clearer mind, etc. Wright makes a strong case. Other advocates of meditation do, too. The problem, in a sense, is personal to everyone, however: who is willing to steadily devote a half hour every day...or an entire week...to sitting in silence, reflecting on his/her mind's restless attempts to persuade one that just sitting there isn't going to do it...not going to paint the house, not going to get you into a good college, not going to save your marriage?But no, Wright contends, all that isn't true. Just sitting there, taking note of one's thoughts, begins to give one power over those thoughts, which squirm into consciousness from millennia past and often are counterproductive exaggerations of the true state of things.The question then arises: If your thoughts are unreliable guides to the state of things, is there something else, beyond thoughts, that might be termed the deeper mind...less tribalistic, less concerned with material survival, less Darwinian, less excitable? Wright submits the answer is yes, even if most of us will never reach a state of enlightenment, and that our deeper mind has natural affinities with the deeper minds of others, is less judgmental, more open, more free, and more compassionate."

164,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1808251-diogenes-grief,Rating 5 out of 5,"It would be a supreme understatement to say that the world, and especially the United States, could use a lot more mindfulness these days. Societies are fraying and Gaia is pissed. “More and more, it seems, groups of people define their identity in terms of sharp opposition to other groups of people. In consider this tribalism the biggest problem of our time. I think it could undo millennia of movement toward global integration, unravel the social web just when technology has brought the prospect of a cohesive planetary community within reach. Given that the world is still loaded with nuclear weapons and that biotechnology is opening a Pandora’s box of new weaponry, you can imagine our tribalistic impulses ushering in a truly dark age” (p. 29). Even if Wright had no real idea of what was to come in just a few years, he at least could feel the shadow of Mordor encroaching. He goes on the embrace humility and gaze into the mirror: “I am, in microcosm, what’s wrong with the world.” Unless you’re living in Fantasyland where everything is perfect as far as your myopic eyes can see, you’re probably more aware of the seemingly accelerated pace at which humankind is careening towards catastrophe in the Anthropocene. Unfortunately I’m an American, one who has been futilely trying to wake people up to this unraveling republic (but at least someone, finally, Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept, agrees with me: https://theintercept.com/2020/08/28/t..., and Mental Health America reinforces this diagnosis: https://www.mhanational.org/issues/st..., even though their report was published in 2019, before the pandemic). America needs healthcare for all, to include mental health care for all. With so many falling prey to propaganda and weaponized disinformation, sowing division, and wet-dreaming of a new civil war however (https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/20...), this country might be too far gone to save it. No one is born a racist, or a xenophobe, or a misogynist—they are programmed at early ages by those around them, and later in life by Fox News and other powerful agents of malicious discord. These deplorable people can be outnumbered, outlived, and out-voted. Each and every one of you must wake up and do your part. No one is innocent anymore. The future hangs in the balance, and a violent schism is looming. OK, now it could be said the world would be a better place if everyone just chilled the F*** out and focused on themselves first, which Wright fully agrees with, and one of the primary principles of Buddhism is to truly understand the overwhelming “stuff” we have absolutely no control over, push it all aside, and instead focus on what we do have complete control over—our thoughts, feelings, and actions. This is mindfulness meditation in a nutshell. “Our brains are designed to, among other things, delude us” (p. 15). They are, and they do it all the time. Hucksters, showmen, religious leaders, advertising agencies, and politicians have known this for a very long time, nevermind the advent of social media. Wright takes us through a wonderful exploration of secular Buddhist mindfulness through his own discovery and practice, and reflecting upon ancient beliefs through a scientifically psychological lens; he then uses that to look upon society at large in the Future-Shocked twenty-first century: “Underlying it all is the happiness delusion. As the Buddha emphasized, our ongoing attempts to feel better tend to involve an overestimation of how long ‘better’ is going to last. What’s more, when ‘better’ ends, it can be followed by ‘worse’—an unsettled feeling, a thirst for more. Long before psychologists were describing the hedonic treadmill, the Buddha saw it first” (p. 52). The human brain is a labyrinth of mysteries still largely unplumbed, but Buddhism seems to have attempted this plumbing four to six centuries before the Common Era, lightyears ahead of anything the “West” ever produced. There’s something powerful in that knowledge. In the army, I cross-trained with Thai troops in 1993, spent a few days in Bangkok where I visited Buddhist temples, and began to see the world through a very different lens, far from the crap taught to me in high-school history classes. In undergrad I took a class on “Religions of the East” and read such things as The Tibetan Book of the Dead. I originally saw Buddhism as very metal—the annihilation of the Self, the embracing of Oblivion, the impermanence of all things, etc. I’ve been an armchair Buddhist ever since. Of course actual Buddhism is terribly complex (https://aeon.co/essays/what-lies-behi...) and not the beautiful, shrink-wrapped, hipster stuff that made yoga so incredibly popular over the past ten years, helped self-help books and yoni eggs become a multi-billion-dollar industry, and made “namaste” a silly salutation that Indians laugh at the Western cooption of (but don’t get me wrong, yoga has huge benefits and I practice it myself to varying degrees of success and well-being: https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/arti...). Wright knows this and does a nice job of separating what we actually need for personal mindfulness meditation from what we don’t all necessarily need, leaving the minutiae for more professional, spiritual Buddhists. As with yoga, similar benefits to overall health and well-being can happen with mindful meditation (demonstrated repeatedly through neuroscience studies), and I think such a paradigm could heal the world, but I also feel large parts of the world don’t want to be healed, and so humankind and all the biomes of Earth are irrevocably screwed. It’s only a matter of time. However, the rest of us have a choice to mitigate the pain and melancholy by challenging our attention, refocusing our will, and adapting a lifestyle resilient to the creeping chaos. I have been practicing yoga and mindfulness off and on for almost twelve years now. It is not easy, but it is incredibly helpful. So, cast your ballot, march for just causes, torch police cars if you absolutely must, but much more importantly take the time to deeply reflect upon why you want to do these things. What are the thoughts behind such desired actions, and what are the feelings behind such thoughts? Why are those feelings so powerful within you? How deep does that taproot go? Once you’ve delved those depths, push it all aside and focus on your breath, your heartbeat. This is being grounded to the Earth. Thich Quang Duc’s final moments illustrate the enormous power of such inner strength. Even if it accomplished nothing but a horrifying photo-op for the world to witness, he became an icon of passive resistance and self-sacrifice for a greater cause. Another tenet of Buddhism is how everything is impermanent. The police car you torch will probably land you in prison. Marching in a protest will probably accomplish nothing tangible. Your ballot may or may not influence an outcome. Let it go; you can only do so much. We are flotsam swirling in the gyre of human history. Societies rise and fall. Governments collapse and rebuild. Chaos and order intertwine through the eons. This is Causality. Suffering is a constant for far too many of us and Death is inevitable for everyone and everything, but the one thing we have absolute control over—with time, practice, and discipline—is our individual self. Wright quotes Walpola Rahula, a Buddhist monk who in 1959 published What the Buddha Taught, with “According to the teaching of the Buddha, the idea of self is an imaginary, false belief which has no corresponding reality, and it produces harmful thoughts of ‘me’ and ‘mine’, selfish desire, craving, attachment, hatred, ill-will, conceit, pride, egoism, and other defilements, impurities, and problems. It is the source of all the troubles in the world from personal conflicts to wars between nations. In short, to this false view can be traced all the evil in the world” (p. 70). Whether or not that idea either makes one’s head explode or fly into a blissful state of euphoria is up to you, but it is worth dwelling on when someone has the time and desire to delve into such existential wonderings. Paradoxes are the fulcrum of both philosophy and spirituality. We are animals with incredible potential, influenced by tremendous outside forces on a daily basis, constructing our individual world through a very subjective lens, and self-discipline and self-awareness are truly “muscles” of a sort that need extraordinary nurturing. One of my sayings is that “we craft our stories to fit our fantasies.” Wright complements this idea at the end of Chapter 10: “We build stories on stories, and the problem with the stories begins at their foundation. Mindfulness meditation is, among other things, a tool for examining our stories carefully, from the ground up, so that we can, if we choose, separate truth from fabrication” (p. 164). The crux of this sentence is “if we choose”, because without making that choice, nothing will change. Overall this is a truly wonderful read, one that I will purchase and read again, and one that will hopefully continue to open the inner eyes of many and help this world lean towards greater enlightenment and selflessness. “I am, in microcosm, what’s wrong with the world.” Most of us are—me included. Embrace what little control you have and thrive within it. Welcome the idea of Death but whisper for the Grim Reaper to wait. Spread your practice to others in the hopes that they too will adopt stronger mindfulness habits. “I think the salvation of the world can be secured via the cultivation of calm, clear minds and the wisdom they allow” (p. 269). Make the world a better place through fellowship and equality, truth and humility, and mo-fo empathy. The elimination of suffering is a chief goal for Buddhists. Impossible, no doubt, but nevertheless an endless desire. I will endeavor to do my part, and I encourage each of you to attempt to do yours. So in an act of humility, I will apologize to all the Deplorables out there. I will try to be better, and I hope you will too. Hell, we could “be best” together, hand in hand, because united we stand, and divided we fall. (Group hug.) “Here is how Bhikkhu Bodhi put it in a series of lectures he recorded in 1981: ‘It is here in this space between feeling and craving that the battle will be fought which will determine whether bondage will continue indefinitely into the future or whether it will be replaced by enlightenment and liberation. For if instead of yielding to craving, to the driving thirst for pleasure, if a person contemplates with mindfulness and awareness the nature of feelings and understands these feelings as they are, then that person can prevent craving from crystallizing and solidifying.’This is where we start to segue from the exotic to the naturalistic. The liberation that Bhikkhu Bodhi is talking about is, in the first instance, a liberation from perpetual rebirth, a liberation that will fully kick in at the end of this life cycle. But it is also liberation in the here and now, liberation from the suffering tanha brings—liberation from the craving to capture pleasant feelings and escape unpleasant feelings, liberation from the persistent desire for things to be different than they are” (p. 230). It might very well all begin with reading this book."

167,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45322768-adam,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm not Buddhist and I've never meditated. Still I know a number of skeptical, rational, atheist people who have share a naturalistic world view who speak of the value of Buddhist beliefs, so when the opportunity to read this book came up I was willing to check it out.Robert Wrigth's logic in solid and he makes great arguments but ultimately I'm not sure I buy the premise of the book. He is completely up front about what he is arguing and what he's not. He argues for the truth and value of the naturalistic parts of Buddhist beliefs, and discards the supernatural claims, such as reincarnation ... That's great! It's just it seems like he's arbitrarily picking the good from the bad that suit his needs. ""Buddhism is consistent with a naturalistic world view if you only consider the stuff that is consistent with a naturalistic world view."" Well yes ... of course it is. One might similarly say that any faith, no matter how ridiculous it may be, may have concepts based in reality. So from that point I think the title is a bit deceiving, but the author completely acknowledges that which is nice. Whenever he said anything I found questionable he immediately followed it up by calling that out and addressing the concern I was on the verge of raising! That's always nice.In generally the way the book details how the mind works based on it being the result of natural selection is great. This is a world view I share and I look at everything about my own behaviour and that of others, be they human or animal, through the lens of natural selection. He puts some weight to this with well backed up science. He then ties this in, sometimes fairly loosely, to Buddhist beliefs. Sometimes the link is clear and at other times I'm not totally convinced. When he writes his own words they are clear and make a point that I agree with. When he quotes the Buddha or some ancient text the context seems vague and easy enough to tie to almost anything.Many core Buddhist ideas he talks about just seem nonsensical to me. The idea of not self, emptiness and essence I really wasn't sold on, as much as he attempted to make compelling arguments for how these were partially true and based on science.The introspections Rober Wright gained through meditation are truly great. He has a basis of a scientific understanding of the mind and uses that to explore his own mind. This seems like a great approach to meditation. Introspection through the lens of psychology, biology and evolutionary psychology, to better understand one's own mind. He applies what he knows about psychology and perfects and refines it through meditation. I'm not convinced he'd find that same insight through meditation alone. When he speaks of other meditators and conversations he's had with him he seems to be overly charitable with what they say, often going so far as to putting words in their mouths ""Are you saying that XYZ?"" ""Well yeah I guess."" ""I knew it! Your enlightened beliefs mesh with what science says about XYZ!"". Okay...It seems meditation has great value for the author and others. I'm not sure the book has convinced me that this needs to be a part of my life, but it has made me curious. I question some of the basic concepts of what enlightenment can be gained through meditation. Everything explained in this book makes sense through the lens of science and evolution by natural selection. I just don't understand though how natural selection would equip us with a tool which can't be accessed except through something very unexpected in our evolutionary environment, deep meditation. Still the basic premise does seem sound. Mindful meditation allows for introspection which just allows to understand one's own thinking better.Ultimately one idea I really liked was that metaphysical truth aligns with moral truth which aligns with happiness. I always strive to know myself and the world as best I can. I think there is great value in the truth which is why I'm a skeptic and try to understand what is true about all things in the world. Truth about all things seems, as Robert Wright argues, to cause people to gravitate towards moral truth. Being deceived can lead to negative experiences but the truth will often cut through that. Ultimately that this aligns with happiness is also promising. I like to think that this is a good argument for AI and superinteligence. Our fears often suggest that anything more intelligent than us may somehow not align with our interests but if the truth aligns with moral truth then something aiming for a truth beyond our understanding will also be more likely to lead to moral truth, and not somehow decide humanity is better of destroyed, enslaved or something equally ridiculous.Good book with good ideas. Just not sure I totally buy the premise. Makes a good case for meditation but it's such a major time commitment that I'm not totally convinced I'll be making room in my life for it."

What if we could discover these motivators of our behavior and have more active control over how we behave despite these hard wired motivations? These are the types of issues that are addressed by Buddhism - and more specifically Buddhist philosophy without the requirement of the more religious side of Buddhism. In Why Buddhism is True, the author reviews how the findings of evolutionary psychology comport with Buddhist philosophy and, in my opinion, does a great job of it. If this is a topic that interests you, this is a great book. It may be a little heavy if you’re just dipping your toe into this subject, in which case I would highly recommend the podcast “Secular Buddhism”, by Noah Rashetta, as a starting point.

175,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104090874-omar,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book will appeal to Westerners who are trying to understand how their lives are changing with meditation and mindfulness practice. Wright has a secular and naturalistic approach to Buddhism and lays out how science seems to be catching up to what the Buddhists have been saying for centuries. He makes a convincing case that the salvation of our species may depend on getting our mental lives in order and seeing past the delusions that often times has us feeling unsatisfied with our lives. Where I personally benefited the most from this book was his examination of the idea of 'no self'. The idea that the self may be illusory made me uncomfortable, the notion that there may not be an unified persistent center in in our bodies that has control, or a 'CEO' as he puts it. Science seems to be moving in this direction as well. Wright examines the issue with ease and ultimately explains how it's not really a big deal in the big picture:“Don’t get hung up on whether something called a ‘self’ exists. Just use the parts of the not-self doctrine that are useful, in particular the idea that none of your feelings are intrinsically a part of you. You can observe these feelings for what they are: things that some module is trying to give force to. The more you observe then this way—observe them mindfully—the less face they will have, and the less a part of ‘you’ they will be. Mindfulness meditation is, among other things, an attempt to give calm passions more power and give the violent passions less power”The paradox of it all is that you seem to gain more control of your life the moment you give up the notion of control. Whether it’s illusory or not its undeniable that its an emergent phenomena and that you certainly experience a self that is in control. Even Zen masters still feel a sense of self, so nothing is really lost. Also, a strong sense of self is very much necessary to survive in the world ( the Buddhists describe this as the 'conventional self') whether it's illusory or not. Wright believes natural selection gave us a self in order for us to be coherent and consistent actors ultimately for the purpose of passing on our genes ( others would argue its so we have a sense of moral responsibility). Mindfulness practice can help us see past the illusion to help tame the worser sides via non-attachment which will generate a happier, productive, and more fulfilling life. I'm not completely sold yet that we don't have an actual ""CEO"" but the topic no longer feels threatening to me which is a relief. I think the big takeaway from this book is to obviously practice mindfulness. It helps you gain insight into every area of your life. Mindfulness at first is used for therapy as it's mostly getting to understand your mental life to gain composure and reduce emotional reactivity ( at least for me). To take the practice a step further is when things become 'spiritual' and the pursuit of enlightenment begins. Enlightenment can mean so many different things, but insight into an ultimate reality sums it up best for me (i.e. non-duality). Most people, if any, will ever actually become 'enlightened' because it may not actually be a real thing but the pursuit of this almost mythical state is what's transformative because it demands for you to look past the veil which can lead to profound yet subtle changes in our lives. This can be a scary thing to do at times--it's the red pill moment in the Matrix as Wright references several times, but ultimately it just re-enchants you and brings about that childlike wonder to life again which is a beautiful thing-- it's a worthy pursuit--but we shouldn't get obsessed over it as the journey itself is what's enlightening.Bottom line:All in all, I thought this book was fantastic. I didn't agree with everything he had to say and I wouldn't call myself a Buddhist, but i've certainly been circling Eastern ideas and practices for years now and they've been helpful. Science seems to be catching up to what Buddhists have been saying for centuries as well. Meditation, spirituality, Buddhism, etc probably won't turn most of us into Zen masters, but if it can make us just a little bit happier and fulfilled while resolving existential anxieties then it's worth the effort and time. 4.5/5"
176,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19086852-shannon,Rating 2 out of 5,"I have strong ambivalence about this book because parts are brilliant and other parts make make me grit my teeth.[Update:] After having a friend read it and discussing it with him, he brought some other points up which have made me revise my review down to 2 stars from 3. It's even more flawed than I realized.Upon discussing this book with my friend, who does not have extensive meditation experience, it became clear that there were other things about the book that didn't make sense, particularly to someone with that point of view. This in turn led to discussions about science writing in general and Wright's in particular.If you are going to talk about why ""Buddhism is True"" from a scientific standpoint, then you need to apply something like a scientific method and rational discourse. State what you mean by ""true."" What does ""Buddhism"" do for us? Wright claims that it will improve your happiness and you will be more compassionate and peaceful. If you say that, then you need to say how to measure happiness, and peacefulness, and then you need to be able to show what research demonstrates these effects in people who are either Buddhists or mindfulness meditators.There actually is research that measured precisely these things, and finds that mindfulness meditation improves kindness, it improves self-awareness, and it lowers the blood pressure and improves other stress markers in the body. There has been ongoing research in psychology that focuses specifically on Tibetan Buddhism and its psychological model of the mind, which apparently is pretty good and very sophisticated. Wright discusses none of that research. He focuses a lot on what it does for himself and people he's met and interviewed. He spends some time talking about how modern models of the brain appear to line up with Buddhist philosophy. The other thing I forgot is that this book comes from the standpoint of a secular Zen student. There are numerous forms of Buddhism and many of them have devolved into glorified versions of indigenous religions, with new Buddhist trappings, still with deities and the same old superstitions. He never really specified which Buddhism he meant, but this is actually extremely important; we have writings of what Siddhartha Gautama Buddha said, but his life and words have had the superposition of legend, misattribution, appropriation, bad and/or numerous translations applied to it in the 2500 years or so since he lived.I really wish this had been a book that did actually discuss what is meant by ""Buddhism,"" what it means for it to be ""true"" and how we know, but really it was a book written for existing American/Western Zen practitioners, discussing philosophy more than practice, and attempting to use evolutionary psychology fallacies to bolster its points.Original review:As long as he sticks to topics which there is actual evidence for -- even if it's only his personal experience, or just interviews with other meditators and teachers -- his writing can be brilliant. There's good scientific research out there on the effects of mindfulness meditation, new models of the human brain, and whether the teachings of Buddhists relating to human psychology were onto something. But just as I'm reading along, thinking, ""yeah, yeah, exactly! Oh fascinating..."" he trots out the evolutionary psychology drivel. I mean drivel, there's no other word for the type of speculative nonsense where we imagine what early man / hominids were thinking and what evolutionary pressures were DEFINITELY at play . . . which of COURSE, OBVIOUSLY that is why we all do X today. This is straight up pseudo-science, and the really unfortunate part is, it's *completely* unnecessary to his thesis! There's enough real science and experiences to back up his views, he otherwise makes persuasive arguments.I skimmed through the bibliography at the end and there are actually comparatively few evolutionary psychology references that back up the most irritating things Wright said. I won't list them all, not only are there too many but not gonna lie, I hate enormous GoodReads reviews. You just want to know if the book is worth reading!!So I'll just sum up by saying, it's great as long as you skip past the evolutionary psychology drivel."

178,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22660169-jonathan-lu,Rating 3 out of 5,"Ok book that parallels lessons of the classics with scientific theories from evolutionary psychology. ""True"" is not a definite truth, but in the scientific sense that it's our best hypothesis explainable by scientific observations for a theory that cannot be tested according to the scientific method. (Meta in the nature of the Buddhist belief and quantum definition of truth). I haven't read Robert Wright's more famous book (The Moral Animal), but understand that this book continues in his same theme akin to Richard Dawkins's ""The Selfish Gene"" in that human existence is driven by a biological drive for survival of our genes, and our bodies are just the containers for DNA to pass on - and his theme of this book in that the attributes which enabled humans to evolve for thousands of years are no longer useful in our modern day (modern even going back a few thousand years to structured societies - as compared to hunter-gatherer times), and lessons from the classics such as Buddhism mean to teach us ways that are contrary to our historical evolution so that we can continue to thrive in the adaptation of our changed environments. My note:Meditation - focus on breath gives a point of physiology to focus on, so the default mode network (DMN) does not wander to past memories or fears/anxieties	- Then shift concentration after DMN is quieted	- It’s much more than just DMN. DMN is quieted by tryptamines and alcohol. One causes ego dissolution and the other ego expressionRealizing you do not have a self literally makes you act selfless. Understand that you are separate from your emotions, perceptions, attachments.Form is not self. We can change our form without changing our self.Emotion is not self. We can change our emotions without changing our self.Wright uses the terminology ""modules"" to describe the different aspects of our self: emotions, intelligence, physiology.Thoughts think themselves. The conscious mind is not in control2nd part of book all about evolutionary biology. Psychological studies about self / subconscious activities, such as our genetic prevalence for mating and how the presence of a beautiful woman causes men to act with short term resource interests. This was driven by the evolutionary benefit that resources attract sex. The drive still persists today because our “modules” are more than our conscious self. Loose writing by stringing together various scientifically accepted observations in drawing a parallel to Eastern spirituality.Feelings are what drive delusions - and those delusions are useful for us to survive and pass along our genes. Similar to Shankar Vedantam's ""Useful Delusions"" - though, Wright defines delusions are useful for passing along DNA rather than just useful for us to survive in the realities that we create for our own selves.""Live and let live - if you're enjoying the matrix, go crazy. Except if your behavior hurts others"" (eg implicit bias)On meditation: ""Zen is for poets. Tibetan is for artists. Vipassana is for psychologists."" Tongue in cheek generalization that I will remember, feeds my own bias that vipassana is all about observation, and mindfulness is viewing how your mind works.The rest of the book has been about behavioral psychology - downfalls of system 1/2 thinking in modern day, fundamental attribution error and how it benefited our survival by giving us the perception that we need to propagate (rather than what is objective truth); traits that served us 1000yrs ago but are less useful today. This section has been less interesting to me as a less scientific, more anecdotal, and more poorly told version of Kahneman and Tversky.Buddhism as running contrary to evolution - transcending above the self. Feelings evolved to serve our survival, drive us to take actions that would enable our genes to pass on - Buddhism tells us to view no essence of self."
179,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17483237-farnoosh-brock,Rating 3 out of 5,"A good book with a terribly misleading title. It's ironic that while the author talks about the destruction of ego, he chooses to name his book in such a presumptuous way. One thing I always find annoying about religions of the world is how they claim to be THE one, THE answer, THE way, THE only truth and salvation of us sinful humans. My impression of Buddhism was the opposite; that it is all-accepting, all-welcoming, and so the title is off-putting, but the minute sample of the audio pulled me, and I hoped it would be a good introduction to Buddhism.As I listened to the book over the course of the past two weeks, I couldn't decide if I absolutely hate it or love it, and then I would see the irony yet again: The very message of this book is about observing our thoughts from the seat of awareness, and creating a space that reminds us we are not our thoughts, we are not our version of reality. So I did that. I kept an open mind, and asked: ""What can I learn from this book that can help me be a better person, a better wife, a better daughter, a better coach to my clients, a better yogi?"" And I found some insightful answers. Here are some of those answers:- If you can observe your negative thoughts or feelings in a mindful way, if you can ""face"" them and not act on them, their power decreases and they eventually go away. The author uses various examples of temptation and desire to make his point. I remember my mom was doing exactly what the author suggests and I took great joy in telling her that she was using Buddhism to achieve it. Storytime: Back when we lived in Iran, my dad traveled to the US for 6 months to plan our future, and during that time, my mom decided to get in perfect shape to surprise him. She went on a drastic diet! Her clever method to resist the many temptations at the countless family gatherings with tables filled to the brim with Persian sweets and delights was to imagine herself eating the dessert, tasting it, delighting in it, swallowing it and being done with it. As she did this, the desire to have the actual dessert went away; she was back in control. THAT is exactly what the author talks in his mindfulness meanderings. -Meditation, even for 20 minutes a day, can benefit you over time. It can help you become a better person and my favorite, it amplifies the beauty of the world around you. It will help you be more attuned to sounds and touch and sight of what is now most ordinary, and that can help you slow down and satiate more in life. What I wasn't crazy about is this notion that our feelings and thoughts are something to ""get rid of"". He dances circles around this idea but essentially, he is saying that our feelings He uses The Matrix - clever analogy, using a popular movie to make his point - and this whole idea that the way we behave and operate is all decided upon by Natural Selection many eons ago. So it is natural selection that put us in this tribal community mode of operation, and how that idea of tribe is not good and does not work for how we need to live and be with other humans. I don't know. Maybe I'm not yet at a level to appreciate it. Maybe this didn't really interest me.Oh and there is the whole ""Self doesn't exist"". Sorry but you don't really exist. And don't worry, neither does anything else. Hmmm. Definitely a bit too existential for yours truly, but maybe one day, I'll be glad to know that my 'self' doesn't really exist. ;)!All in all, I'm not glad to have read this book. And that's okay because I don't read books for a singular reason. I read them to gain an unexpected insight, and even if I'm very familiar with the ideas of observing our thoughts and pausing before we act, the way this book went about it was yet another angle that I do appreciate. "
180,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6429894-jayson-virissimo,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is probably the ideal book for pitching Buddhism to me personally, since I otherwise trust the author (based on his previous work), have studied some evolutionary psychology and find it useful, and am already convinced of utility of having a life-philosophy or set of organizing principles for living well. It's definitely a good book: well written, doesn't misrepresent the science (AFAICT), full of insightful anecdotes, and clear explanations of core concepts.A few criticisms though:1. This book doesn't really defend Buddhism in general as it is practiced or understood by most people calling themselves Buddhist. The book could have been more accurately titled ""Why an Interpretation by Western Philosophers of a Subset of a Heretical Form of Buddhism Could Be Useful for Some Purposes for Many People Much of the Time"" rather than ""Why Buddhism is True"" (although I can see why that book would likely sell far fewer copies).2. The talk around ""essences"" is ambiguous and vague. Often the term is used by the author to mean a snap judgment about something (perhaps made by the nervous system's preprocessors or more primitive parts of the brain), an affect experienced by the person perceiving or considering it, or as a description of the internal nature of a thing. Yet, we are supposed to doubt the usefulness or objective existence of each of these by the many examples of the supposed essence of a thing changing (or muting) due to various meditative practices. But why should this be the case? When we learned that atoms have an internal structure, and so our conception of the internal nature of things was refined, that did not thereby demonstrate that things do not have objective internal natures. It simply means that we were ignorant of or had a misconception about its objective internal nature. It is surely possible to be aware of a thing's existence while not having a completely accurate view of its essence. This seems to be confusing epistemology with ontology.3. The author argues that the no-self doctrine is likely to lead to a more peaceful world, but the reasoning is convoluted. The fact that your ""self"" in some sense doesn't exist does not imply that you should have greater compassion for others, simply because you aren't so important anymore. You could just as validly conclude that others are less important than under your pre-no-self worldview, since they don't have a self either (and so aren't morally relevant in the sense you might have thought under a worldview that includes ""selves""). He could have argued that there is no logical connection between the no-self doctrine and compassion for others, but that, in fact, people adopting this doctrine do tend to become more compassionate. You could easily test such a thing by (naively) comparing mostly Buddhist countries and frequency of initiating war, or (somewhat less naively) looking at violent crime rates for cohorts that includes people that convert to Buddhism or start engaging in mindfullness meditation along with those that don't, but the author opts for none of these empirical tests. Ultimately the link between the no-self doctrine and compassion (and even less, a more peaceful world) isn't supported by (valid) logic or empirical results."

However, many centuries ago Buddhism came up with a way to look beyond our knee jerk reactions of attraction and repulsion. It is called mindfulness meditation and Wright adds modern knowledge from neuroscience and psychology to show how we can have a truer sense of our best interests and thereby gain more self-control. In particular, he is interested in two Buddhist concepts: not self and emptiness. Incidentally, these are two ideas I have long struggled with... Let's start with emptiness because Wright helped me finally nail this idea. Although we see, for example, our home as the source of security, continuity and lots of warm feelings associated with family, it is really just a pile of bricks and mortar. In the Buddhist sense it is an empty concept onto which we have projected all these emotions. Sure, our home evokes lots of strong reaction but a passing stranger would just see a house and react to the architecture or the location - which once again carries various cultural projections about whether a detached house is better than a semi-detached and how close it is to shops or how remote (which are all equally arbitrary criteria). As a therapist, I'm used to the concept that nothing is inherently good or bad but coloured by how we marshal our experiences, our prejudices and our expectations. So good so far... but not-self is a much tougher idea. What I did find interesting is that Wright scuppers the idea of self as CEO which sits somewhere inside us and decides rationally what actions to take. Instead he uses neuroscience to explain that we have various modules that take charge. Rather than fighting temptation - for example to eat high sugar and fat foods - he suggests using the acronym: RAIN. Recognise the feeling, Accept it, Investigate the feeling and finally - the hard bit but meditation apparently helps - to Non-identify with the feeling and have Non-attachment to it. In this way the urge is allowed to form but does not get constantly re-inforced by the short term pleasure of, for example, eating the cake. Thus the link to the reward is broken and although the urge might still blossom without gratification it reduces and ultimately subsides.The downside to this book is that Wright - like the majority of us - is a relative beginner to meditation and when it comes to seeking clarifications about Buddhism and enlightenment, he has to interview people further along the road. My suspicion is he often hears what he wants to hear, simplifying the arguments and glossing over the complexities of his case. Having said that I am convinced that I need to meditate more and take on board the concept of emptiness - because it is my attachment to particular things and outcomes which is often the source of so my unhappiness.A useful book that I will stay with me for a long time and I recommend to others who want to take the red pill and see the 'truth'."

The fundamental concepts of no-self, dukka, emptiness, loving-compassion are among the virtues that Wright believes not only are supported by science, but have the potential to radically change our world. He owns up to the provocative title by stating that he is strictly referring to a naturalistic Buddhism. As a a guide, Wright’s approach is unique. He approaches his material from an experiential point of view, having spent days in retreat and meditation. He also approaches the work as a scholar. And even as a poet, he describes the agonizing self-growth and his walkthrough of the dharma path. At times he describes his own awakening, the subtle pangs of our emotional chemistry, and the subtle shifts in itself. It's fair to say Wright could be a stand in for a lot of seekers. A religious background, a successful role in the culture, and yet there is a dissatisfaction. And so the journey of the seeker continues.Articulating his experience, I was impressed by some of the questions that Wright approached that have bugged me in my own journey. How is it that the compassions increase while the selfish passions decrease from meditation? What is the goal of all this work, is it getting us any closer to the real nature of the world? Some explanations, for instance Wright’s discussion on emptiness and essence, were as clear cut as any I have ever heard for the idea. There is surprisingly little discussion of science form external studies. Wright may reference the meditation studies of monk meditators with Richard Davidson, but hardly goes into the studies. For all the chatter about a shift in human consciousness, there are surprisingly few discussions on how mindfulness practices have been introduced in school systems to success. My criticism from the other side is that Wright does not seem to share his own experiences that have influenced his Buddhist investigations. You will not find the enticing words of the Buddhist teachers that have helped nurture a western perspective to the Buddhist mythology. Not that this book has to “save souls” or radically change the minds of people, but I’m not sure Wright’s work will be all that influential in the way teachers like Baba Ram Dass, Robina Courtin, Pema Chodron, Sharon Shalzberg, Jack Kornfield have been.Moments stir, and it does strike me as a book very much of our time. If Wright’s hope is to have more responsible adults that are less chained to their brain chemistry, maybe his book will reach and connect with people. Maybe this approach to a mirror evolutionary biology and buddhist naturalism is another chapter in an ancient tale."

185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31968163-the-overflowing-inkwell,Rating 1 out of 5,"As if the evolutionary psychology explanations for everything weren't silly enough already, his recollections of his first grand adventure into meditation at a fancy retreat are even sillier. Delve in for stories of how he caressed some hapless tree in the garden, waxed poetical about why we call some plants weeds and some plants flowers - really there's no difference, so why get so grumpy about it, right?? - and felt some kinship with a lizard. Go further for stories about how his refrigerator also sounds like a harmonic instrument, and how his amazing newbie attempts at meditating got rid of his ABJECT RAGE toward a snorer in the hall, or the dissolution of his sense of self to such a point that he felt a tingle in his foot and birdsong through the window were both part of him (within his first week of meditation!).He comes up with some terrible ideas along the way - such as when he's addressing the possibility of meditation to lessen your love for others, namely your children. ""Imagine a world in which affluent American parents showered slightly less devotion and concern on their children. And imagine they spent the time saved thinking about children who don't have parents at all and asking what they could do to help them. Would that be so bad?"" He, of course, follows this up with ""I want to emphasize how hypothetical this is"" because - yeah, that's a serious 'what if' scenario that I'd wager has absolutely no basis in reality. Just because some helicopter mom stopped caring quite so much about her kids doesn't mean she immediately transfers that percentage of obsession to foster kids.The descriptions of pro meditators' brains and how they perceive life sound absolutely deadened and awful. Everything still tastes the same, they say, but now there's no such thing as a 'fantastic glass of wine'. Things like chairs, tables, lamps, all become one faded continuity with the background, nothing really different or special about any of them. In short, the idea of pro meditation is to take all the joy out of life, in a quite literal way, so that we also don't have any hatred or anger or bad emotions. Yay, what a deal.Original review (15/Jan/2018): Just. . . . actually painful to read. I'm going to have to come back to this and give a proper review in a day or two when the headache subsides."

Why do we constantly want more....more pleasure, more achievement, more money, more recognition, more and better food, more fun...on and on? Always looking ahead, not content in the present moment, forever anticipating the next ""great"" thing. And once we get that thing..turns out we overestimated its ability to make us continuously happy. So we repeat.The book does a great job of explaining, from the point of view of evolutionary psychology and the evolution of our species in general, why we are like this. We were designed to never be satisfied. It's by design! Our brains are hard (and soft?) wired to be singularly focused on getting our genes into the next generation. We were not designed to be kind, compassionate, happy and satisfied people. So, by understanding this fact, and being aware of its pervasive influence on us, we can see reality a little more clearly over time. If we see reality a little more clearly, we can suffer less, and cause less suffering for others.And the book then walks you through how, through meditation, you can slowly, calmly come to recognise this inherent bias/condition we all have, deal with it, and choose which thoughts, emotions, feelings and impulses are useful to pursue, and which are not.Robert Wright has a wonderful writing style, not arrogant or boring. He does a great job walking the reader through the most complicated, paradoxical part of the book-and Buddhist teaching- the so called ""not self"" doctrine. He makes an effort to break it down, share his own experiences, and get the reader to understand this slippery concept.This book has helped me understand the importance...the vital importance, of making meditation a daily practice, and not getting frustrated or giving up if my mind wanders, jumps around, and it seems like I am not making progress. That´s part of the training, part of the process. Sit. Meditate. Work on it. Vipassana, Lovingkindness, and focused concentration. 3 types of meditation. The mind needs consistent, focused, daily exercise...just like the body."
187,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24847694-timo,Rating 2 out of 5,"Well...what to say.IF the author had titled this book ""Why Mindfulness is True,"" I may have cut him more slack. Though he tried to backpedal the title a couple of times, at the beginning and again at the end...he still trips over it. When I was a young mormon boy (no longer, thank goodness), each time I read something like ""science proves that alcohol is bad for you!"" it was evidence, to me, that Mormonism was true. But that's a confusion of correlation. The author makes this same problem over and over again. He approaches the topic as though the Buddha himself invented mindfulness, rather than simply discovering some helpful methods for better understanding one's self (ha!) and how to train the brain. Finding that mindfulness works well for these purposes in no way shows that Buddhism is true.The promise of the book was that he'd show us how evolutionary psychology aligns with principles of mindfulness. If he spent 10% of the book on this, I'd be surprised. The evidence and scientific basis was really an add-on, as though every now and then he remembered that purpose.He mis-states Einstein by trying to show that Relativity validates the idea that a singular view doesn't exist (he tried to align this with the non-existence of self). But relativity actually shows the opposite; that all knowledge is derived from a viewpoint. That he thinks this supports the idea of a no self...well. That said...I do think that there's value in mindfulness, and that's why I read the book. I wanted to learn more about it. And there were chunks of the book that helped on this path.But it doesn't take me to Buddhism, even if Buddha was instrumental in forwarding mindfulness."
188,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71935584-ben-zimmerman,Rating 4 out of 5,"I was skeptical of the title, ""Why Buddhism is True"", but the author is arguing for the truthiness of a narrower, secular idea of Buddhism. The central thesis of the book is that Buddhist ideas, such as our bias towards anticipation and dissatisfaction, biases in perceptions of the world, and incorrectness of our intuitive conception of the self are supported by experimental evidence in psychology. Natural evolution bestowed us with certain ""illusions"" of perception and expectation in order to facilitate future gene propagation.I found Robert Wright's interpretation of emptiness as the process of de-connecting emotional labels (and thus inherent judgements) with perceptual objects to be extremely fascinating, although I don't know enough about Buddhism to know if that is what Buddhists mean by emptiness. In fact, that's how I felt about a lot of the book. I was learning about Buddhism from Robert Wright, who is not a Buddhist scholar (as far as I know), so I don't know what degree Wright manipulates Buddhist ideas to fit his own view and the view of experimental psychology. The more moralistic parts of the book seemed a lot weaker to me, and some of the grander spiritual insights seemed too speculative. For instance, Robert Wright proposes that reaching enlightment is a transformation of subjective experience, where one sees the world as ""empty"" (emotional detachment), and experiences ""no-self"" in a perpetual way. Do Buddhists agree? I would like to hear from at least 10 very experienced meditators describing what the world that they perceive is like.Overall, I found the book to be well-written, very insightful and thought-provoking, with some reaching speculations and a weak moralistic message attached to the end."
189,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Quite Thoroughly enjoyed this one. I make a habit of reading books that make sense within the context of my life. With this book, it's hard to say if it's that great of a book or that it just works so well within the context of my personal enjoyment of mindfulness meditation as a daily practice.Still, I appreciate what the author is trying to do here and I like that the book reads like an extended exploration of the fundamentals of buddhist practice while attempting to link them to things like our biology and natural selection as a creator of our minds and thoughts. The thoughts are well explained and the progression of the book is really quite good. I think if I had to sum it up for somebody as to why Buddhism is true, I could probably do a pretty good job describing the author's arguments. I hope and trust I will get the opportunity to do that pretty soon.I think after having read the book I'm much more curious and excited about my meditation practice. I think there's something to be said for observing oneself in a non-attached way in order to find out more about where your motivations and feelings come from. I think I mean this in a practical sense, but this book helped me fill in the more intellectual side of the equation as to why meditation is important. The fact that people have been grappling with these kinds of questions for hundreds, if not thousands, of years is incredibly helpful. The author does a great job bringing those questions and that search into a modern context.Really enjoyed this book right now."
190,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book did not disappoint, as Robert Wright was able to craft a easily digestible (considering the topic material) and intriguing book about mindfulness meditation and the human mind. The book was much more about the topics surrounding buddhism as opposed to a sales pitch for the actual religion, but it was very successful in helping the reader comprehend and learn about the religion as well, and why it can be so beneficial when dealing with shortcomings of the human condition. The book covers important topics that I was interested in, such as what feelings really exist for, where our thoughts arise from, and other philosophical points about the self and how humans perceive the world. I really enjoyed the perspective it gave about why we think we're the ones calling the shots, while in reality we are just the evolutionary products of billions of years of evolution, and this reality is not exactly optimal for present 21st century functionality. Why Buddhism is True is an eye-opening book from a wonderful author.""The human brain is a machine designed by natural selection to respond in a pretty reflexive fashion to the sensory input impinging on it. It is designed, in a certain sense, to be controlled by that input."""

192,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5410681-tony61,Rating 4 out of 5,"Why Buddhism is True, by Robert Wright [Hardcover, library] Four stars.Robert Wright has all the qualities of a good writer. He explains things well and maintains a healthy humility and simplicity of style that make his handling of complex ideas understandable. I’ve read two of his other books-- Nonzero and The Evolution of God-- and he now applies his talents to Buddhism and meditation and how the main precepts are corroborated by what we understand of psychology and natural selection. Wright admits that there is only so much you can learn from reading a book about meditation and practice is necessary to really “get it.” Having said that, Why Buddhism is True is a solid attempt to present evidence that meditation has empiric benefits from reducing stress, gaining insight and, even for a beginner like himself, giving a glimpse of enlightenment. Wright sees such mindfulness practice as having benefits for society at large.The strength of the work here is to define the terms and explain the concepts and purposes of Buddhism. Wright differentiates eastern Buddhism-- and there are several sects or schools that can be quite different-- from Western, or secular Buddhism, that accentuates the meditative properties while eschewing the supernatural aspects of god, karma and reincarnation. This book emphasizes the secular benefits and their relationship to human evolution and psychology.The first noble truth is that all beings experience suffering, or dukkha, better defined as “unsatisfactoriness.” Dukkha arises from attachment, or tanha, which Wright defines as “thirst” or “craving.” Evolution has selected individuals through natural selection who have successfully avoided negative situations, such as predators, and have been attracted to beneficial situations, such as food acquisition or mating. In other words, we have evolved to have attachments. We are also selected to feel unsatisfactory, to continue to strive for an improved situation. Buddhists discovered that these evolutionary adaptations lead to feelings of unsatisfactoriness. Thousands of years ago thinkers like Buddha determined that such feelings of unsatisfactoriness deplete our happiness and they sought a way out of the cycle of tanha. The first question I had while reading is that this seems counterintuitive to try to short circuit evolution by eliminating the thirst for safety and food and procreation, all the things that have led to our success. Buddha taught that the “self” is an illusion and our human condition is really separate from our perception of reality. Wright uses the Matrix movie as an example, where Neo is presented with the red pill-- living in reality-- or taking the blue pill, i.e., continuing to live in the illusory world created for him. He chooses the red pill, which is analogous to someone choosing meditation to rise above the illusion of our human condition as we know it. Simple but not easy; we cannot just take a pill (although many in the 1960’s tried with LSD.) Meditation practice is difficult. Living without illusion, as Neo chose in the movie, has a set of potential dangers but it’s the only way to enlightenment.Wright points out that life on the savannah was helped by development of attachment-- tanha, thirting and craving-- but as we have moved into larger, more interdependent, social groups such behavior can be unfavorable, not just for feeling satisfactory, but actually for survival. Biological evolution has made way for cultural evolution and the same qualities that were beneficial in one scenario may lead to discord in more modern societies. Humans have developed a series of delusions about our place in reality and meditation is designed to break down these delusions, to show us that we are separate from our stated desires, feelings, etc. Dukkha-- i.e., suffering, or feeling of unsatisfactoriness-- is born of the attachment to these delusions of self. While we are separate from our feelings and desires and even our thoughts, we are also inherently entwined with each other. A paradox of sorts. Our self is not ours, but a part of the hive-self of our community. There is no way I can explain the concepts as well as Wright. He uses personal anecdotes about his mediation experiences that add to the understanding of the process and the goals. Enlightenment is the experience of a momentary glimpse of our “consciousness” as separate from our thoughts, feelings and even our “self.” In fact, he states that the goal is to understand that there is no “self”, and the realization that we are “non-self” in the vernacular is often brief and occurs only after months or years of meditation. Nirvana is the state of permanent enlightenment, rarely achieved and only by a few meditators.Wright takes it a step further to say that humans have an imperative to realize the illusory nature of our “self” in order to break down the tribalism that is an existential threat to our species. This is the next step of evolution, a cultural evolution to see humanity as a unified being, or something like that. Like I said, you might have to read the book.One experienced Buddhist meditator discouraged Wright form writing this book, stating that it would reduce his chance of achieving liberation from the self. Wright tried to justify the act, reasoning that he wished to bring the news of meditation to many who would not otherwise hear it. Evangelism, of sorts. The Buddhist said that the world would be better off with one truly liberated person rather than a book. Interesting. Also: Neuroscientist and accomplished meditator Sam Harris interviewed Robert Wright for the podcast Waking Up in October 2017. This conversation is helpful to give further insight into the topics covered in the book. Harris adds insight and explains things slightly differently which is helpful. I would recommend listening only after reading (most of) Why Buddhism is True in order to have an introduction to the topics. "
193,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6826433-elf-m,Rating 3 out of 5,"I have a soft spot for Robert Wright, as he often seems to be a slightly better constructed but also angrier version of myself. His books The Moral Animal and Non-Zero were big and insightful; both argued that evolutionary complexity leads inevitably to both morality and economics (which he also suggests is a subcategory of moral thought), provided no stray asteroids or nuclear wars happen, and his case for both was strong and compelling, if also somewhat incomplete.Why Buddhism is True, his new book, is thematically quite different, although he does tread similar evopsychological ground from time to time. Wright is a big fan of scientism: he wants scientific explanations or correlations for phenomena and here he gets into the weeds of neurobiology and modern psychology to explain why Buddha's insights were and are useful.Wright starts off with a chapter on the illusion of reality, and talks about how the physical, squishy grey matter locked away inside your skull manufactures, moment by moment, a story about who you are and what you're doing. There's good evidence this is true. He writes that our brains, especially our emotional system, is exapted for an environment utterly unlike our modern world, and that food manufacturers, television producers, and nowadays social media networks seek to exploit the misalignement between what our technologies can do, and what our brains can handle, to create within us obsessions toward their brands of food, media, or games. Buddha, Wright explains, understood this a lot, and not only were his insights but his recommendations for how to deal with this maladaptive misalignment were and still are among the most useful.Buddha diagnosed our problem as restlessness. The Four Noble Truths at the heart of Buddhism start with ""You are a creature whose restlessness and dissatisfaction with your state makes you unhappy."" Evolution comes to the same conclusion: we need to eat, and stay warm, and reproduce; a creature of satisfaction is unlikely to pursue these goals, and so is a failure. Our emotional system is designed make us pursue pleasures, the pleasure of each fading over time, making us restless for more.Wright spends a lot of time on this sort of thing: correlations between classic Buddhist teachings and what the science actually says. The idea that there is no ""self,"" but instead lots of little ""selves"" inside, the ones that distract us from our stated goals in pursuit of shorter-term pleasures, the ones that arise and cripple us with anxiety, and how these ""modular subselves"" will co-opt or organize to make us seemingly different people at different times, or in different places, or with different people.The book makes a bit of a left turn about 2/3rds of the way through, when Wright starts talking about Nirvana, Enlightment, Emptiness, and so forth. He starts out by saying that you are not unhappy, you are the subject of all these selves about which you tell a story that presents ""you"" as a coherent whole. Wright even delves into how the story we tell ourselves and the story we tell others is different, but both are coherent; it's just that the one we tells others is modified with motivations that make us seem capable, trustworthy, and coherent. We might even believe both stories; after all, we make for lousy evolutionary replicators if we had high anxiety all the time.Wright ends with a plea that others ""take up the cushion,"" even though he's quite sure he's never going to get as far with it as many other meditators. The insights meditation gives us, to look at things as they are and not as we wish them to be, to step outside ourselves, and to just exercise the powers of concentration, are valuable; it also seems almost inevitable that with these insights comes a sense of compassion and wisdom that most people lack.Wright's book is completely devoid of supernaturalism. There are no gods in his book, no demons, and no other dimensions to see. There's only this one, and Wright's conclusion is that we need better tools to see this one clearly, and Buddha came up with a damn fine, if sometimes exceedingly sharp, set of tools.Wright's book won't convince you if you're unwilling to be convinced, any more than the combined strength of astronomy and geology won't convince a young earth creationist. But he makes a strong case for Buddhist, Stoics, and those sympathetic to the contemplative life, that the basic meditative toolkit, with at its heart the daily practice of meditating (with its sub-disciplines) to improve your concentration, assess your morality, and seek clarity, is probably one of the best you can find.—As I was writing this review, I was reminded that the notion that we always communicate a ""better"" version of ourselves to others, and the notion that there is no ""self"" inside, were both covered in The Illuminatus! Trilogy over forty years ago. The first, that we communicate ""better"" versions of ourselves, is covered by The SNAFU Principle, and the second, that we have no ""self,"" is covered when Hagbard asks George to figure out who's in change ""in there,"" (pointing to George's head), and George imagines his mind as a house, searches from room to room, concluding ""Nope. Nobody home.""""That's funny,"" Hagbard said. ""Who's conducting the search?""Wright's book is a modern plea for a modern understanding, but really, these tools have been around forever, and it would probably behoove many of us to use them more often."
194,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book looks at the Buddhist diagnosis of life under the lens of evolutionary psychology. The author makes the case why natural selection would lead us, for instance, to be perpetually unsatisfied (but also believe that getting something new will give us greater satisfaction than it actually does). I especially enjoyed the discussion of how thoughts and feelings are generated and why we identify so strongly with them. This segues into an analysis of some pretty deep Buddhist concepts like not-self and emptiness, which I think the author handles in a novel, interesting, and accessible way.I enjoyed his conversational tone (though at times it was a bit too conversational for my taste), especially when it came to his own struggles with meditation; this resonated strongly with me. I think the author made a very strong case that gaining a critical distance from our thoughts and emotions via mindfulness meditation can in fact bring us closer to seeing a metaphysical and moral truth.I'd definitely recommend it to anyone interested in psychology and Buddhist thought."

He very clearly breaks down why meditation can help a person change the way they experience emotions, think, and react to the world. I wish he had gone further in other areas - like how meditation can improve physical health as well. Since I live in NYC, I realized that the Insight Meditation center (which Wright mentions as the source of his meditation journey) is in walking distance of my job, and was able to try a group meditation class the same day I finished the book. It was a nice, centering experience and I plan on going back. There are a lot of good tools for anyone looking to start a meditation practice to maintain sanity in our current society - Why Buddhism is True is one of them."

There are still things that I liked. Favorite quote: ""Humans are by their nature delusional"" Favorite new interesting hypothesis: mental health has become a wide-spread illness during modern times, partly due to long-distance communication. When people were living close to each other, if they were to hurt someone's feelings, they would not form make a mental obsession out of it, as they were going to see this person the next day and ask for forgiveness. Long-distance communication leaves room for a lot of rumination, which can also lead to mental illnesses."

Wright makes some interesting points about the agreements of modern science and secular Buddhism. I'm unsure how accurate is portrayal of modern science and Darwinism is - and I sort of question if he's just drawing conclusions that the researchers wouldn't agree with. That said, I think I learned a lot of Buddhist belief and the purpose of meditation. I especially liked his treatment of how emotions carve out our viewpoint of the world - and how emotions originated in evolution, a process that cared less about an accurate portrayal of the world and more about survival. ""The cost of survival of a lineage may be a lifetime of discomfort"" - Buddhism attempts to overcome this by connecting humans with reality (for example, not getting emotional and annoyed about slight disturbances)"
198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74143369-jim-mehnet,Rating 5 out of 5,The primary idea of the book is that human thought processes were shaped by evolution and that secular meditation/mindfulness can help us correct these processes in a way to fit the modern world rather than that of the hunter gatherer. The self professed driven/high-strung author’s personal tale of how secular insight meditation practice helped him become a happier and less reactive person personalized the ideas the book. A discussion of how evolution likely created our minds and thus shaped the standard heuristic thinking patterns we humans use is interwoven throughout. Just how meditation can create a work-around of these evolution derived dead end heuristics is explained. If you are interested in if/how/why meditation might benefit you this book will prove informative in addition to being simply fun to read.

I specifically like the concept of Mindful Meditation, which for me, offers a practical way to calm my mind. The middle of the book deals with several complex issues, but at a rushed and shallow level. Many psychology and neuroscience experiments were cited to validate each of these, sometimes opposing, issues.

He approaches Buddhist philosophy from the standpoint of evolutionary psychology and neuroscience and makes a convincing case for how the principle ideas of Buddhist teaching now have a solid scientific basis. The writing is clear and concise, the author does not try and dumb down the science but makes it very accessible to scientists and non-scientists alike. I highly recommend."

But I still found it to be a great, entertaining, well-encapsulated reminder of why I spend so much time and mental energy on this stuff.

At times he leans on Buddhism to validate his political and scientific views. It started well with the benefits of meditation and mindfulness but meandered into just another close minded progressive lecture. It was easy to visualize the Darwin fish bumper sticker on his Prius.
206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8614696-st-fu,Rating 1 out of 5,What was I looking for? Not what I found. I picked this up because of a bad review which complained that his removal of the supernatural from Buddhism flattened it. But that wasn't the problem. The actual problem is that he's writing for people who think like he once did so that he can move them to how he thinks now. I'm neither starting in the right place nor wish to reach his destination which I will arrogantly declare is as illusory as those myths he's trying to dispel. He thinks he took the red pill but took a placebo. The placebo effect generated this book.
207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5817790-steve,Rating 4 out of 5,"Enjoyed a lot of this book, although some was a bit meandering. I would have titled it “Why some parts of the theory and practice of some forms of Buddhism correspond to a modern, western understanding of evolutionary psychology” - but I guess no publisher would put me in charge of naming new books. But as someone who is very interested in evo-psych, and intrigued with reflection and introspection, and a bit skeptical of it all, this is a very intriguing book. Also, I like Wright’s sense of humor and self-deprecation. (Or in the Buddhist way, maybe “non-self” deprecation?)"

O autor é um cientista que se beneficiou da meditação de mente plena e relata sua vivência e pequenos progressos.

This books and online course is about Western Buddhism which is more focus on Buddhist meditation practice, less on reincarnated, buddhist deities, or supernatural part and the scientific evaluation of Buddhist ideas, that is, Buddhism in naturalistic view: susceptible to scientific evaluation. For example, Buddhism addresses questions like, why do people suffer? feel anxiety? etc. A lot of ideas about the human mind.Is this naturalistic version of Buddhism religious?The definitions of William James: Religion is the belief that there is an unseen order and the faith that that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto===================Summary: From natural selection , more precisely from evolutionary psychology view, Human label everything with feelings for surviving purpose, this feelings propel thoughts and reasons. We like to think it is reasons make us doing things, we are in full control, but in reality, it is feeling which is in full control, it is the feelings compete each others, feelings invoke different reasons , so reasons are slave of feelings. Reason does not work solely if reason cannot make associated feeling win first, in other words, desire human want the most win. So author argue if we can mindful meditate those feeling, using Buddha way, we could finally escape the control of feeling to achieve enlightenment.Science behind all: Natural selection: a system prized surviving and getting our genes spread. Any tendency help us to survive get passed on. Any trait is not 100% pure and 100% evil, more over judgment of good and bad can be circumstantial. Natural selection shape our mind. Science theory behind the feeling: Modularity of Mind (related to Theory of mind, autism have difficulty in Theory of mind). A certain part of brain or mind associate with a typical feeling, so there is no CEO of all these minds, there is no mind under control or in control. What is real?Our feeling is not accurate description of reality. Feeling can influence perception and thoughts. Our minds can deceive us about reality. Meditation is a technique for among other things giving yourself some critical distance from your feelings to avoid being misled by them. The Four Noble Truths (四諦), covered by the acronym 苦集滅道: all life is suffering 苦, the cause of suffering is desire, thirst, craving 集 (in psychology, it is called Hedonic Treadmill), emancipation comes only by eliminating passions 滅|灭, the way 道 to emancipation is the Eight-fold Noble Way 八正道. 四諦概括了兩重因果關係：集是因，苦是果，是迷界的因果；道是因，滅是果，是悟界的因果.Dukkha: suffering, dukkha nirodha, 苦滅 . but “unsatisfactoriness, yearning ” “disease,” or “stress” may convey the meaning of dukkha more accurately. Dukkha, in a general sense, is the natural discomfort we all experience in life. It may come in many forms: anxiety, regret, anger, grief, sadness, clinging, and many more.In a short words, to meditate is to eliminate passions. The way to eliminate passion is to template three marks of existence: impermanence (anicca 诸行无常,in Buddhism, the cycle of birth, life, and death), unsatisfactoriness or suffering (dukkha 苦)non-self (anattā 無我).The key of meditation is template non-self and emptiness (meaning there is no inherent essence in everything, or view everything objectively, e.g table is a table without any attachment of feeling in it, it is neither bad nor good). Meditation is to cultivate detachment, detachment of subjective view and objective view. It leads to one question, meditation will make us less emotional, less feelings, so it will make us a vegetable. I don't think so, from my experience, free those bias emotions could make us appreciate everything truly as it is, just like Gary Weber's experience of emptiness, it is empty fullness. , exactly free of emotion can let us full of emotion, see the world with perfect clarity. let us finally in control, liberate from (dukkha)suffering, achieve enlightenment (no more illusions), or nirvana (涅槃（超脱一切烦恼的境界）.Meditation on breath is to quiet default mode network, the first step to mindfulness of meditation.if you want to see practice guide on meditation, see this book:classic book The Experience of Insight: A Simple & Direct Guide to Buddhist Meditation by Joseph Goldstein (only 169 pages, range in 13 days, very practical)问什么要无我，空，我觉得这本书的解析比所有的中文佛经的解析更让我容易理解，我感觉看佛经，中英文一起看更容易理解，对初学者来讲，英文的解释比较深入，要对佛经理解更深，中文好一些。===================p25 I mean ""Scientific foundation"" of a Buddhist view in the sense of using all the tools of modern psychology to look at such questions are:1. Why, in what particular ways, are human beings naturally deluded?2. How exactly does the delusions work?3. How does it make us make other people suffer?4. Why would Buddhist prescription for dispelling the delusion - in particular, the meditative part of that prescription - work?5. And what it mean for it to work fully? In other words, does the elusive stat that is said to lie at the culmination of the meditative path - sometimes called enlightenment - really qualify for the terms?6. What would it be like to see the world with perfect clarity?Both our natural view of the world ""out there"" and our natural view of the world ""in here"" - the world inside our heads - are deeply misleading. Failing to see these two world clearly does lead, as Buddhism holds, to a lot of suffering. ---if these questions are interesting to you, you should read this book. ===================Notes: 1. illusion: things not being quite what they seems, delusion: more dramatic sense. numerous illusions will be delusion. 2. chapter 3, Are feelings is illusions?usual take-home lessons of Buddhist philosophy is that feelings just are. If we accepted their arising and subsiding as part of life, rather than reacting to them as if they were deeply meaning, we'd often be better off. It works. But just because being less reactive to some of your feelings make your happier doesn't mean it bring a truer apprehension 理解 of world. Maybe this less reactive stance is like narcotic: it dulls the pains by insulating you from the real-world feedback that your feelings provide. Maybe it's meditation, not your ordinary consciousness, that put you in a dream world -- my comment: piercing thoughts. Level of delusions--- Our feeling weren't designed to depict reality accurately even in our ""natural environment. ""see"" a snake that isn't actually there.---The fact that we're not living in a ""natural"" environment makes us our feelings even less reliable guides to reality. Our biological design of sweet tooth.---underlying it all is the happiness delusion. our attempting overestimate of happy, and a thirst for more, hedonic treadmill. So before following your feeling, subject it for investigation. 3.

But you can't be everything unless you are nothing. It just logically follows that's the case"" -- my comment: his idea of emptiness is like mine, for my understand, emptiness is not nothing, it is everything. or emptiness, oneoness, everyone is the same thing. ===================3. 佛教用语Theravada 上部座佛教 南传佛教, Doctrine of HinayanaMahayana 大乘佛教 Hinayana 小乘佛教 a vehicle of lesser energyvipassana 内观；观禅；毗婆舍那 Theravada Buddhist meditation that aims at concentrating the mind, denotes clear vision, usually translate as ""insight"", define vipassana as apprenhending 理解 ""the three marks of existence)the three marks of existence: impermanence (anicca 诸行无常,in Buddhism, the cycle of birth, life, and death), unsatisfactoriness or suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anattā) 三法印：诸行无常、诸法无我、涅槃寂静Not-self 無我 (difference from translation as ""no self,"" The teaching here is not that there is no self; it is that experience is not self)Emptiness 空Chapter 15The view from nowhere, see The View from Nowhere by Thomas Nagel----------------五蕴: 色蕴、受蕴、想蕴、行蕴、识蕴五种。 在五蕴中，除了第一个色蕴是属物质性的事物现象之外，其余四蕴都属五蕴里的精神现象五蕴 five aggregates 色蕴 physical body、受蕴 basic feeling、想蕴 perception 、行蕴 mental formations、识蕴 consciousnessSkandhas (Sanskrit) or khandhas (Pāḷi) means ""heaps, aggregates, collections, groupings"".In Buddhism, it refers to the five aggregates concept 五蕴 that asserts five factors constitute and completely explain a sentient being’s mental and physical existence. The five aggregates or heaps are: form (or matter or body) (rupa) 色蕴sensations (or basic feelings, received from form) (vedana) 受蕴perceptions (samjna) 想蕴mental activity or formations (sankhara) 行蕴consciousness (vijnana) 识蕴The skandhas concept is in contradistinction to the idea of a unified ""being or individual"", and complements the anatta 無我 doctrine of Buddhism which asserts that all things and beings are without self. The anatta and ""five aggregates"" doctrines are part of the liberating knowledge in Buddhism, wherein one realizes that the ""being"" is merely made up of a temporary grouping of five aggregates, each of which are ""not I, and not myself"", and each of the skandha is empty, without substance. Difference In the Theravada tradition (上部座佛教 南传佛教 小乘佛 ), suffering arises when one identifies with or clings to the aggregates. This suffering is extinguished by relinquishing attachments to aggregates. The Mahayana tradition (大乘佛教)asserts that the nature of all aggregates is intrinsically empty of independent existence. The use of the skandhas concept to explain the self is unique to Buddhism among major Indian religions. It contrasts with the premise of Hinduism and Jainism that a living being has an eternal soul or metaphysical self.--------------------------------sati: 正念, translated as mindfulnessmindfulness different interpretation in Buddhism and current usage. see more on chapter 4.samadhi n.三昧; 正定, translated as concentration 佛教和印度教中的修行方法,意为止息杂念mindfulness: in popular sense means pay attention what happen in here and now and experience it in a clear, direct way, unclouded by various mental obfuscation. Stop and smell the roses. In Buddhism, it means beyond this. e.g in Satipatthana Sutta 四念处经, mind our bodies are full of unclean things, such as, pus, urine, etc., or 八聖道，The Eightfold Path, right mindfulness 正念./////////////////////////// - from WikepediaRight mindfulness ( sammā-sati)The most detailed discussion of right mindfulness in the Pali Canon is in the Satipatthana Sutta, where the emphasis is to consider the ""four contemplations"" – body, feelings, mind and phenomena – as just that and nothing more, and not ascribe to them any substantiality, nor self.According to modern Theravada orthodoxy, these ""four contemplations"" 四念处 through right mindfulness lead to insight of the three characteristics of existence – anicca 诸行无常, dukkha and anatta 诸法无我, and cover the five skandhas (aggregates, heaps) 五蕴 Difference The Noble Eightfold Path is one of the principal teachings of Theravada Buddhism, taught to lead to Arhatship.In the Theravada tradition, this path is also summarized as sila (morality), samadhi (meditation) and prajna (insight). In Mahayana Buddhism, this path is contrasted with the Bodhisattva path, which is believed to go beyond Arahatship to full Buddhahood. In early Buddhism, these practices started with insight (right view), culminating in dhyana or samadhi as the core soteriological practice. In later Buddhism, insight (Prajñā) became the central soteriological instrument, leading to a different concept and structure of the path///////////////////////////p 52 In Buddhism, it is in Satipatthana Sutta 四念处经, The Four Foundations of Mindfulness - contains no injunction to live in the now. There is no terms in the entire text that is translated as ""now"" or ""the present"". There is a term that can be translated as ""in this world"" or ""in this very life and occasionally translated as ""here and now,""but in context refers to the time when the rewards of a certain level of meditative attainment will come- that is, during this cycle of life, as opposed to after death - and isn't part of the instruction for how to realize mindfulness. This doesn't mean that ""staying in the present"" wasn't part of the experience of Buddhist meditators two millennia ago. If you focus on your breathing or on bodily sensations, as prescribed in ancient mindfulness text, the present is where you will be. Still, if you want to go full-on Buddihst, you need to understand that staying in the present, though an inherent part of mindfulness meditation, isn't point of the exercise. It is the means to an end, not the end itself.

The author (Robert Wright) seems to have realized the problem, in that he addresses the title in both a prefatory note and in an appendix. Despite the title, the book is not evangelism for Buddhism as religion, and readers of all religious beliefs or non-beliefs could well enjoy the book. Wright's premise is that (a) evolutionary pressures caused our minds to be optimized for reproductive success, but, unfortunately, those same pressures caused us to have irrational cravings and to be poor at perceiving ourselves and the world around us accurately, and (b) some aspects of traditional Buddhist practice (in particular, mindfulness mediation) and thought (such as the concepts of ""not-self"" and ""emptiness"") help people to more accurately perceive reality, reduce suffering, and behave better. The first half of the book are interesting and helpful. Wright ties modern psychological findings (as covered in books like the fabulous Thinking, Fast and Slow) to Buddhist ideas. The exploration of the ""not-self"" idea is (no pun intended) quite enlightening. Wright explains the ""modular"" model of the mind used by many modern psychologists, and makes a strong case that the mental model of the ""CEO self"" (conscious, rational thought directing one's behavior) is empirically false. Wright's also ties the Buddhist ""emptiness"" idea (in part, the idea that things do not have as much ""essence"" as we normally attribute to them, and that we are too quick to label things as ""good"" or ""bad"") to psychological evidence of prejudice of various kinds.Unfortunately, the second half of the book is a relative disappointment. Wright offers a lot of anecdotes about his own experiences with meditation, and subjective commentary about the benefits of mindfulness. He goes on to make an argument that it is imperative that humanity start down the (secular) Buddhist path in order to avoid a planetary catastrophe in the form of war or other horrors. Wright does not, however, address some of the positives out of our allegedly irrational cravings; for example, the way in which desire for financial success seems to promote innovation that benefits many people, or how the desire to achieve recognition in a scientific field drives the discovery of amazing and beautiful truths.Curiously, Wright offers almost no insight into how one might best develop one's own mind in the fashion that he espouses. He describes a number of meditation retreats in which he has participated, but if one does not have the resources to go on a long retreat, Wright offers little practical advice about how best to get started.As someone interested in psychology, and in improving my own patterns of thought and behavior, I found the book worthwhile. However, I recommend that readers should put the book aside when they reach the point that they are no longer interested, rather than (as I did) plow on to the very end."
252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69754586-ryan-denson,Rating 5 out of 5,"First of all, it should be noted that the title of this book is very misleading, since this book involves only a type of “secular” Buddhism, which is stripped of any grand metaphysical/supernatural claims and focuses primarily on the theory and practice of Vipassana mindfulness. To his credit, Wright does say this explicitly at the start of the book, but it seems some people overlooked that. This is clearly not a book advocating a particular religion’s complete validity, despite the strong title.That said, Wright’s book is unique for its methodology of combining ideas from this “secular” Buddhism and modern evolutionary psychology. Wright expertly dispels many popular conceptions of the way the mind works, such as simplistic notions that the “self” is a single entity. Instead, he describes ideas that are current in modern psychology. The main one being the modular mind theory, the theory that human mind are made up of various “modules,” each of which has its own priorities and perceptions. These are triggered by various emotional responses and sometimes clash with the other “modules.” The “self” is, therefore, not a singular entity that directs the conscious mind. And if there is no “self,” how can we so easily speak of a supposed “self-control”?This is one area that Wright then begins to incorporate Buddhist ideas, such as the idea of the “notself.” Overall, he powerfully details how Buddhist teachings on being mindful of one’s thoughts and feelings can help calm the mind. As modern neuroscience shows, our thoughts and feelings have a profound effect on our perceptions. Learning to control these, or at least attempting to control them, can radically alter our perception of other people and ourselves. This is the goal of the mindfulness techniques of Buddhism. It encourages people to both recognize and dispel the illusory nature of much of the way we perceive reality. Certainly, these are not easy goals to attain. I fear many will read this book and disregard it as mere idealism, despite Wright’s constant caveats that the Buddhist idea of complete enlightenment or Nirvana may be something of an asymptote or only hypothetical state. Nevertheless, at least striving to be a little more enlightened, in the sense they we learn to be mindful that our perceptions are frequently illusory, may still bring some tranquility. Overall, this is an excellent read. Wright does an incredible job of breaking down complex science and tough Buddhist ideas. These are then masterfully described alongside each other. One example: there is the impulse created by natural selection to seek things that would appear to be beneficial for genetic survival and aversion towards potential threats. This is related to the Buddhist idea of tanha, “thirst” or “desire,” which frequently leads to people to feel discontent with their own lives. This is a fantastic read for anyone interesting in philosophy or psychology, but will also be insightful particular to those who struggle with anxiety and other maladaptive perceptions about the world and people around them.

253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17336796-kumail-akbar,Rating 5 out of 5,"For non-Buddhists, the title of this book might seem a little off putting unless they (like me) have been exploring Buddhist ideas and practices (mindfulness, meditative breathwork aho!) recently or have done so at some point in their lives. However, this book is much more than what its title suggests and I would strongly suggest anyone interested in ideas in general and life, mind, consciousness, philosophy, neuroscience and evolutionary psychology more specifically, to give it a go. Right is not out to convince you to wear yellow robes and go sit in the middle of nowhere in order to reach nirvana, nor does he seem to have any appetite for fables, myth and story-telling. He is out to convince you that Buddhism, or at least a subset of ideas and practices found in Buddhism, when stripped off their mythical claims, provide invaluable tools to the average person in order to help him live a better life. Right argues that natural selection predisposes our minds to behave in a certain way to stimuli, a fact that limits our agency, and that Buddhist practices such as mindfulness meditation allow us to step away from such causal traps, thereby providing us with more agency in the moment. He recalls experiences that any meditator would recognize, but non meditators might not intuitively get – that thoughts appear on their own into our consciousness, we do not think them – and that feelings can be decoupled from thoughts, analyzed and owned or discarded – all to our benefit. In his own words: “This is a reminder that natural selection didn’t design your mind to see the world clearly; it designed your mind to have perceptions and beliefs that would help take care of your genes.” “This has been the point of much of this book. The human brain is a machine designed by natural selection to respond in pretty reflexive fashion to the sensory input impinging on it. It is designed, in a certain sense, to be controlled by that input. And a key cog in the machinery of control is the feelings that arise in response to the input. If you interact with those feelings via tanha—via the natural, reflexive thirst for the pleasant feelings and the natural, reflexive aversion to the unpleasant feelings—you will continue to be controlled by the world around you. But if you observe those feelings mindfully rather than just reacting to them, you can in some measure escape the control; the causes that ordinarily shape your behavior can be defied, and you can get closer to the unconditioned.”“If you want the shortest version of my answer to the question of why Buddhism is true, it's this: Because we are animals created by natural selection. Natural selection built into our brains the tendencies that early Buddhist thinkers did a pretty amazing job of sizing up, given the meager scientific resources at their disposal. Now, in light of the modern understanding of natural selection and the modern understanding of the human brain that natural selection produced, we can provide a new kind of defense of this sizing up.”Overall, a thoroughly engaging read written in an accessible style.

254,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'd been wanting to read about Buddhism for a while since it seems like the only religion entirely dedicated to helping individuals find happiness or contentment. Rather than join a collective or worship an external being, Buddhism (or secular Buddhism, at least) is about discovering inner peace and personal growth. Now, I realize this all sounds quite preachy and idealistic, but Wright dedicates his book to justifying Buddhism from an evolutionary psychology and philosophy perspective, using both speculations and modern experiments to parse the source of human desire and the reason why Buddhist techniques work. Admittedly, it's been a while since I've read this book and it probably deserves a second reading, but for now, here are some memorable quotes/thoughts/insights:- The author tends to explain a lot of inexplicable things with ""I understand that this doesn't make any sense but I will attempt to make you understand but if at the end of this explanation, you still don't understand, I understand and that's normal."" This certainly makes the book more approachable but perhaps that is also a sign that he is not the best at explanations. Not sure. But I did appreciate his down-to-earth, no-frilly-scientific-words approach :)- Buddhism is based around the principles of emptiness/oneness (there is no inherent meaning, so we must detach objects from the essence and biases we assign them) and nonself (there is no executive self in charge, as evidenced by our lack of control over our feelings and thoughts, so in order to change ourselves, we must recognize what our emotions are influenced by)- Our mind is under the control of 5 difference modules, like finding a mate, maintaining friendships, etc that all are important in our survival. Whichever one is in charge depends on the emotion we are experiencing at that point in time. Basically, free will doesn't exist.- Meditation is about observing your feelings instead of acting on them. It also gives rise to some pretty wild experiences. I should do it at some point. - Your mind will usually convince you/come up with a nice story about why you are doing things when you are actually doing them for very primal reasons. Everyone thinks they're above average. We are all narcissists (jk the book didn't say this).- “Anyway, to be clear: the claim isn’t that everything I feel positively or negatively about will actually have an accordingly positive or negative impact on my chances of spreading my genes; the claim is just that the machinery in my mind that assigns feelings to things was originally designed to maximize genetic proliferation. That it no longer reliably does so is among the absurdities of being a human.”- “Even extended doses of Tylenol, one study showed, can dull the pain of social rejection.” Our soul/spirit/personality/self, however abstract and philosophical it may seem, doesn't supersede biology."

Het is dan ook niet voor niets dat een hele hoop zelfhulp boeken eigenlijk een soort van introductielessen in boeddhisme/stoïcisme zijn. Kijk naar zelfhulpboek nummer één van deze tijden, The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck, dat is in principe ook gewoon de basisprincipes van het boeddhisme uitlegt, maar dan op een oppervlakkige manier en geschreven voor een ongelofelijke lul. Dit boek gaat er wat dieper op in, komt met bewijzen uit de psychologie en sociologie en schuwt ook de filosofie niet. Daarnaast is de schrijver van dit boek echt een enorme goedzak en oprecht relatable.En daarmee begin een een patroon de zien in mijn non-fictie 5-sterrenboeken. Why We Sleep vind ik zo goed, niet omdat het je vertelt hoe je moet slapen, maar omdat het het wetenschappelijke bewijs van het belang van goede slaap geeft. Thinking, fast and slow vind ik zo goed, niet omdat het ons concrete trucjes leert om scherper te zijn, maar omdat het de wetenschappelijke bewijzen levert van hoe ons brein ons voor de gek houdt. Dit boek vind ik zo goed, niet omdat het een cursusje mediteren voor beginners is, maar omdat het wetenschappelijk uitlegt wat de voordelen zijn van meditatie en hoe de wereld ons voor de gek houdt. Meditatie dekt de lading sowieso wat beter denk ik, omdat de schrijver het bovennatuurlijke aspect van boeddhisme (gelukkig) grotendeels achterwegen laat. Niet vaak heb ik een boek gelezen dat me zo aan het denken heeft gezet over geluk, evolutie, waarom we denken hoe we denken en waarom we altijd hunkeren naar meer. Het algemeen bekende beeld van de hedonistische loopband doemt weer op, van de loopband waar je op loopt om hopelijk ooit voldoening te bereiken, terwijl dat een illusie is omdat je zoektocht naar geluk nooit 'af' is en de loopband toch wel blijft doorgaan. Heck, het is een loopband waar ik zelf ook volop op sta, misschien tegen beter weten in, omdat ik net als de meeste andere mensen ook ambities heb. Gelukkig propageert dit boek niet om die loopband uit te zetten om een leven van rust, meditatie en mind-fullness te leiden. Wel leert dit boek je dat het soms goed is om soms eens voor korte tijd van de loopband af te gaan, of om de loopband op een íets lagere stand te zetten, zodat áls je erop loopt, je het wel met een glimlach op je gezicht doet.

256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17763301-andrew-carr,Rating 3 out of 5,"One of my side projects in 2020 has been thinking about the kind of mindsets we need as individuals in dealing with difficult, confronting times. Be it a global pandemic, regional war or a toxic climate, how should we attempt to function in the face of such challenges? Buddhism offers one such path.This is a fascinating book with two different stories involved. One is how and why Wright came to find Buddhism and the benefits he gets (and thinks others can achieve as well) through its teachings and practices. Wright is an engaging narrator of such a shift, charmingly revealing his own flaws, failings, boasting of the occasional success and showing that even an argumentative american can still find benefit from the meditation cushion.The other story is Wright as the evolutionary psychologist attempting to argue that Buddhism represents a coherent effort to understand why our minds are sometimes terrible at either identifying or understanding reality. Along the way he shows how some core buddhist concepts such as 'not self' and emptyness (aka 'existence before essence') reflect our latest thinking about whether there is a specific 'I' or whether objects have innate meanings or are socially constructed.This is probably my own selection bias talking, but I was struck by how similar some of the Buddhist recommendations for dealing with difficult environments, emotions and the like are compared to Stoic philosophy - a long standing interest of mine. Especially when shorn of its spiritual elements, both stress the need to accept the presence of feelings such as anger or guilt, to gain some sense of distance from them 'I am not my emotions, I need not be anxious about what I cannot control' and in turn to mitigate their impact. The way they achieve these similar aims is quite different, but there's an interesting overlap (one which as the existence-essence line above identifies, also brings in much of existentialism).Wright slightly surprisingly ends the book by saying he does not call himself a Buddhist, despite writing such a book and having meditated regularly for over a decade. And I don't feel a calling to adopt it either. But I have ordered several related texts on Buddhism to help better understand its approach. The ancients lived in a world which was 'nasty, brutish and short'. To the degree they developed philosophies to help them not only cope but thrive in the face of this, we should be attentive to their insights. Regardless of their 'truth' or not."
257,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14018739-aazir,Rating 5 out of 5,"I was very impressed by this book. I've read a number of books on Buddhism and consciousness this year and this one has been the stand-out. I really appreciated the way the author framed Buddhism and it's tenants around Natural selection. It provided a unique perspective on meditation and mindfulness practices that I hadn't encountered before. I'm someone who believes very strongly in rational thought and the power of science and logic. In the past, I have often eschewed emotions and their value on decision making. The more I read from fields as broad as biology, behavioural economics and now Buddhism studies the more I realize how flawed this approach is. Emotions are a powerful force in our lives and they reveal the ""logic"" that natural selection has imprinted in us. Wright argues forcefully that by utilizing meditation and mindfulness practise we can teach ourselves to better observe and be aware of our emotions, and in-so-doing have a clearer view of reality and how we approach it. Natural selection has designed us not to have a clear, objective, view of the world -if such a thing is possible - but rather to have the view that best pushes the propagation of the species. Contrary to what is commonly thought, by practising mindfulness, we become more objective and rational in our deliberations and scientific enquiries, not less. The only thing I thought this book was missing, was that it didn't mean certain branches of Buddhism such as certain Zen Buddhist philosophies which do not believe that purposeful meditation can lead to a better understanding of the world - the idea being that to be mindful, you just be mindful, you don't sit on a cushion for a day and try to be mindful. That being said, one book cannot cover all the nuances that exist in a philosophical and religious system that has existed in different cultures for millennia. I would certainly reccomend this book to anyone who wants to be a better thinker or who wants to find out more about Buddhism. "
258,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Overall - fascinating analysis of the ways that meditation can counteract the tricks natural selection plays on us. I haven’t read any other account of meditation/Buddhism that weaves in modern science/psychology like this book did.Takeaways:- “Buddhism is true because of natural selection.” Mindfulness meditation allows our brains to counteract the chains natural selection imposes on us that are amplified by modern life- “feelings” evolved so that we could quickly assign a good/bad judgment to things - many of our feelings evolved to protect us, but they’re now operating in such a different environment from the one they evolved in that not only are they often illusory, but they also don’t serve us (for example, it makes sense evolutionarily that wed crave a donut, but the need for the food isn’t urgent now, and it doesn’t help us)- our brains are modular - like different systems addressing different evolutionarily advantageous things (food, sex, protection, etc). Despite the fact that we feel like “a conscious self in control,” our consciousness is more like a “receptacle” for thoughts coming from whichever module is invoked at a given time. And it’s the thoughts that have the strongest level of feeling associated with it that is the one that gains entry into consciousness. In other words, “feelings are the propellant of thoughts.” The notion of “self” is natural selections way of tricking us into thinking we’re in control. So the best way to take command of the modules activated (our thoughts) is to change the way we interact with our feelings, and that’s the core of mindfulness meditation.- the lack of association between “self” and our feelings/thoughts is a central tenet of Buddhism. Natural selection tricks us into thinking that we’re the thinker of our thoughts and feeler of our feelings. It’s a trick, though, and through mindfulness meditation we can begin to dissolve the illusion of the existence of self / the boundary between self and the outside world."
259,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/141355-john,Rating 4 out of 5,"Obviously the title is trolling for readers but Wright is serious and is attempting to make an argument around the truth of Buddhism (in particular, Buddhist Vipassana meditation).Before I get into this . . . I do think everyone I know would benefit from reading it. If all you want to do is meditate, try Dan Harris’s  10% Happier. If you want to grapple with the big stuff: Well, this is a provoker. I have my doubts about the argument, but this one gets a 5 because if we all read it, we could have a pretty exciting discussion, and, as I suggest at the end, if there is even a 50% chance that Wright is right, we might pursue meditation and acknowledge that Buddhism is true in the manner he describes simply because it might make the world a better place. (By the way, I don’t think there is much here that is incompatible with conventional religions — indeed, I know that some of Wright’s other writings are related to the ideas of the Catholic Pierre Teilhard de Chardin).There's a lot of truth in the negative reviews here on Goodreads, which I read after writing this; he does bloviate, it is kind of loose, but . . . I think the path he takes us on is worthy.The argument goes something like this:1. The cognitive effect of evolution is for the mind to be patterned to avoid situations that would threaten gene reproduction and behave in ways that might help our genes make it to the next generation. Thus, humans avoid being overmatched by violent threats and pursue activities that would reproduce our genes. Such behaviors include sex, but also behaviors among other humans that would increase our likelihood to pass our genetic materials on: For instance, men being able to control more females through domination of other men; or humans taking care of their young.2. The human mind cannot, however, automatically (i.e., quickly / as a matter of immediate pre-conscious brain function) deliberate over the accuracy of evidence that might lead to decisions that hinder death and/or help with reproduction. There isn’t enough evidence or time. Therefore, we have feelings, which are shortcuts that help us behave rapidly based on limited information. These feelings mean that we don’t see the world as it is; we live in a world of illusion. Since feelings emerged before civilization and modernity, they don’t work especially well with our current situations: For example, we are not threatened by tigers, and sugar is no longer a scarce quality, so the feeling of “sweetness” doesn’t do us a lot of good owing to its ubiquity.3. Meanwhile, contemporary psychologists/philosophers of mind have eroded the idea of the executive self. Instead, they see the mind as being a collection of competing modules that use feelings to move our attention amongst them (there is also a lengthy section that argues that this harmonizes with the ideas of mind and the passions promulgated by David Hume in the 18th century). These modules themselves have evolved and represent different patterns for dealing with threats and opportunities to reproduce our genes. A critical point here is that feelings can trump other feelings that are more obviously narrowly correlated with reproducing our genes.4. Finally, certain parts of the Buddhist tradition have evolved techniques of meditation that make it possible to see our feelings “as feelings,” and, essentially detach our point of view from responding to the directives of feelings. In Wright’s view, the Buddhist articulation of consciousness is little different from what the scientists are telling us.Therefore, Buddhism is true, first because of its symmetries to the scientific model, but, most importantly in Wright’s view, because we can experience/validate these claims through personal experience (via meditation).Um, but is Buddhism really true? Dunno. I felt that the science part was pretty slim; and to accept his testimony of the experience of meditation is a bit of a tough nut, since one would pretty much have to meditate oneself in order to truly accept the claim. (He does talk about experiments that measure brain activity during meditation, but a lot of his argument hinges on personal experience.)In my opinion, there are some weaknesses here and there. For instance, Wright doesn’t have a lot to say about more complicated emotions. He can talk about jealousy and even guilt, but there isn’t much there on, say, grief.Alright, so Buddhism is true. So what? What about these questions?* If Buddhism is true, what are the consequences?* Are those consequences good or bad for us — as individuals and as populations?* Suppose the chances of Buddhism being true are greater than 50% (choose your percentage), should we then meditate in the Buddhist fashion in order to tip toward the possible positive consequences?Wright is actually quite interested in these questions, but he handles them as a part of his larger argument. For instance, he does make the argument that there is a link between the practice of meditation and some of the Buddhist values to not commit violence, to reserve judgement, etc. He also finds some evidence (much anecdotal or based on testimony) to say that, on balance, people who practice meditation are more even-keeled. He implies that if we all meditated, we might care for the environment more and might collectively avoid war: Because we would have the detachment to examine and control our selfish and hateful feelings.Would the world be better off if we all meditated? Wright makes me think that we might all benefit in this manner from meditation.But one thing that bothers me about this book is that it doesn’t really consider the benefits of living in illusion. If illusion is being subject to our emotions and passions, what of those cultural inventions that might not be attempted were we more observant of our feelings in a detached way? I think about my friends who are CEOs of startups. These people are a little crazy (OK, a lot crazy) and are pursuing their feelings of domination pretty closely. We don’t always talk about it that way, but they are locked in to powerful fantasies — because they think they’re right (more: they know they’re right [which is surely an illusion]). Do we give up all of the great things that our primordial feelings have motivated for us? Where is the cut off? If we could give up great evils through meditation, is it worth it if it means of giving up our positive passions? And what if evil is not eradicated in the world, but we become so observant that we don’t act in time? Wright touches on these things but . . . maybe that’s what he does in his book Nonzero."
260,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1409618-matt-robertson,Rating 4 out of 5,"In this excellent book, Robert Wright makes a strong case that many of the concepts and techniques developed many centuries ago in India have modern scientific basis in psychology and evolution. Wright draws on multiple sources, including Buddhist scripture, research studies and theory, and his own experiences with week-long silent meditation retreats to show how developing a particularly different mindset can make one happier, kinder, and more in tune with how things really are. What’s more, he says, such a changed perspective may be critical to the future of our species:“...it would be tragic, to say the least, if, after billions of years of arduous effort on the part of organic life, effort that has gotten us to the verge of a global community of minds, we let the natural distortions in these minds blow the whole thing apart. It would be all the more tragic in light of the fact that these distortions are now a scientifically established fact and that we have ways of correcting them, including, though not confined to, meditative practice.”So, this is not purely a self-help book. Especially considering that he points out that psychology agrees in some sense with the Buddhist idea that the self doesn’t exist.Wright’s writing style is very easy to follow even as he discusses rather heady topics. He infuses his writing with lots of self-effacing humor and down-to-earth everyman attitude. A couple years ago I took his online course “Buddhism and Modern Psychology” and found this book to be a similar experience, in form and content, as he intersperses “lecture” content with anecdotes and interviews with various Buddhist scholars. The result is a fantastic college course in-a-book. Finally, I really appreciated the summary at the end, which is a nice touch for a book which may be useful as a reference."

Calling myself a Buddhist, it seems to me, would almost be disrespectful to the many Buddhists, in Asia and elsewhere, who inherited and sustain a rich and beautiful religious tradition."" When the author writes about meditation, it is a selective rendering of an ancient meditative tradition.So what is this distinctively Western, 21st Century version of Buddhism? It is summarized in an appendix, which I wish had been at the beginning instead of the end of the book. Having and attaining goals is not a recipe for lifelong happiness. Unsatisfactoriness (dukkha) is a pervasive part of life. The cause of unsatisfactoriness is the desire to have pleasant things and avoid unpleasant things. Mindfulness meditation reduces this feeling of unsatisfactoriness. Nonattachment to self brings people closer to enlightenment. There is no ""doer of deeds"" or ""thinker of thoughts"" within you; thoughts think themselves. There is no real distinction between your experience of yourself and your experience of things outside yourself. If you become less ""self""-ish, you will become more moral. Things lack the ""essence"" that you place upon them by your judgment of them, and yet non-ethical behavior is still wrong. You should increase your ""awareness of conditioning,"" that is, understanding the causes of your feelings. I could kind of understand what the author was talking about, but all the Buddhist jargon just seemed to get in the way of the author's philosophy of life. I would re-phrase the author's points this way: It's good to have goals, but your goals should be attainable, and you should learn to be happy even if you don't achieve your goals. You are going to be very disappointed if you expect to be happy all the time; you need to accept ""negative"" emotions such as sadness, anger and fear as a normal part of life. If fact, experiencing the full range of emotions and being aware of your emotions is a full life that is more fulfilling than constantly striving for pleasure. Adopting an attitude of acceptance leads to a greater sense of contentment and equanimity than striving to be ""happy"" all the time. Mindfulness meditation does increase a person's ability not only to be more accepting, but also to be more grateful for what you have rather than fixating on what you don't have, and to be compassionate towards others, rather than fixating on selfish goals. People who are less selfish are more moral, more enlightened, and in the long run tend to be happier. You should strive to view the world objectively rather than just seeing everything from your own subjective perspective. You should reserve judgment for things that are morally bad; you should not be judgmental about things that are just different from your own subjective taste or what you're accustomed to. The psychological process known as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective way to understand the cause of your emotions and to identify false beliefs that are causing negative emotions. CBT can greatly reduce sadness, fear, anger, anxiety, and unwarranted feelings of shame and guilt.Buddhism is probably consistent with the previous paragraph, but so are many other philosophies and religious beliefs. My understanding is that one thing that distinguishes Buddhism from many other religions is that it makes no claim to be the one, true religion, making the title of this book quite ironic in my opinion.On pages 298-301, there is an end note that I think discussed a very important statement from page 258. (Really, a four-page end note--is that good writing?) The end note explains that the author's distinctively Western, 21st Century version of Buddhism may logically lead to nihilism. If people are detached and non-judgmental, they may not be activist, may not seek to change the world, may not seek to be ""part of the solution."" The author does not think that's a big deal, because they are still likely to be kind, gentle, non-selfish people, so they won't actually be part of the problem.My understanding of actual Buddhism, as opposed to the ""distinctively Western, 21st Century version of Buddhism"" is that nonattachment to the ""self"" is really more like nonattachment to the belief that you have an immortal soul. Cultivating what Nietzsche thought was the main driving force in humans, the ""will to power,"" will lead to bad karma, and instead of immortality, you'll just forever be reincarnated as something worse than what you already are. I don't know enough about Buddhism to know if this is supposed to be taken literally or figuratively, but either way, I think the idea is that if you can detach yourself from your selfish desires, you'll lead a good life and be able to die in peace. A Buddhist would most certainly not be a nihilist, because you need to be a good, compassionate person in order to avoid bad karma and achieve enlightenment. To me, actual Buddhism strikes me as more ""true"" than the distinctively Western, 21st Century version of Buddhism. I don't mean that it's scientifically true; I mean that it is a path to a good life. On the other hand, there are many religions, as well as secular belief-systems, that can lead a person in this direction.Another criticism I have of this book is that the author's ""problems"" are all First World problems. Does the author really get perturbed when he's waiting on line to buy something and the person at the register is a little slow because they are fumbling to find their credit card? Is he really bothered that someone at a meditation retreat falls asleep and starts snoring? I don't think you need Buddhism to cultivate empathy. Other books, such as Man's Search for Meaning, address ways of dealing with really difficult life situations. I think meditation is really helpful for a lot of people, but I don't think it's for everyone. And for a lot of people, I think having and attaining goals is a recipe for lifelong happiness so long as the person has good, healthy goals. The author himself appears to be goal-driven; he strives to be a successful writer. He does not appear to eschew goals.I gave this book three stars because I thought it was thought-provoking and interesting, but I think the author's beliefs could best be described as being true for him, not true in general. I do get the impression that the author has a genuine need to be less attached to himself."

Some of the topics discussed are the hedonic treadmill (perceived pleasure from an object being larger than the experienced pleasure leading to a cycle of submitting to desires), default self-centric mode of thinking (we are the pivotal character in all our thoughts, alienating others and emphasizing that boundary), feelings dictating the essence of reality (friends are usually good people and any bad behavior is situational, while the bad behavior of foes is inherent to them), questioning perceived reality with emphasis on oneness-nothingness (a pushback against the evolutionary programming of the selfish gene), and so on. The main goal is to convince the reader of the benefits of mindfulness meditation.The book offers a lot to think about, and stays closer to contemplative philosophy than empirical psychology. The accounts are often anecdotal or even self-reported so need to be taken with a grain of salt. In that respect, Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body, a book with a similar goal, fares favorably by sticking to core scientific methods. What this lacks in rigor, it more than makes up for in its ability to make one question some very central assumptions about the nature of experiencing self. The witty writing style with reference to hallucinogens, difficulties that arise during meditation, and some fun yet real characters make the dense subject more palatable. Recommended especially if you think you need some convincing to start or maintain your meditation practice."

The book suggests how a reluctant meditator found usefulness in the practice and in buddhism and wants us all to know that there is psychology and biology behind it. I get that. I appreciated some of the arguments early in the book of how research helps us understand why the practices of buddhism can actually help us become more mindful, more calm, more attentive, and so on.And yes, it may be true that much of both our good and obsessive and potentially detrimental behavior is because we are programmed that way because our ultimate goal (biologically speaking) is to spread our DNA. On the other hand, I felt very removed from the hopefulness of buddhism that this can be a way for all of us to reach enlightenment and that part of this attention on what we do on the cushion is out of the understanding that this can not only change our view of ourselves but that others, too, can be so changed. This is one of those books that would have made an interesting article in Psychology Today or a yoga magazine. Instead, while I appreciate the author's own experiences, too often the examples he relies on are of a decided male perspective that, coupled with the biology connections, seems too facile: if we think our spouse is cheating on us we can be moved to deadly anger (related to said biological imperative to spread our DNA). So Buddhism helps us control those ""animal extincts"" that will otherwise crop up because, you know, biology? At some point, dear reader, you may be crying out, what about the entire culture being given a good hard look and the constant biological determinism a backseat? It starts to sound too much like poor white dude compelled by his biology takes to the cushion to promote mind over (DNA) matter. Wright may not be consciously making that argument or delivering an excuse for spousal abuse. What is the sound of one note striking?"

Science provides the concrete and measurable qualities, but art has a way of tapping into the mysterious and the emotional in a way that science lacks. This book proposes that mindfulness meditation offers a pathway to integrating the benefits of both.It didn’t take much time for me to stray away from spirituality, but diving into this book reignited in me with renewed enthusiasm, my quest for radical liberation the only way I know how: internally. When discussing this book with a fellow science teacher, I mentioned its exploration of Buddhism through the lenses of evolutionary biology and psychology. She immediately drew a parallel: “Oh, sounds a lot like ‘Sapiens’ by Yuval Noah Harari.” The book takes a more accessible approach to discussing spirituality, much like my conversations with coworkers, avoiding overly complex or esoteric religious terminology. It talks about the human brain as a machine designed by natural selection to respond in reflexive fashion to sensory input, designed in a way to be controlled by that input. A key cog to the machinery of control is feelings that arise in response to the input. If you interact with these feelings (via cravings— attraction to the pleasant and aversion to the unpleasant) you will continue to be controlled by the world around you. But if you observe these feelings mindfully, you might get closer to escaping control. Truly paradoxical and more digestible by people, like myself, who see the world as an oxymoron.Favorite quote: “Science, in its displacement of traditionally religious worldviews, is sometimes said to have brought on the “disenchantment” of the world, draining it of magic. Meditative practice can lead to the “re-enchantment” of the world.”"

The author proved well-researched on the topic, through academic study and personal experience. The narrative was true to its focus on secular Buddhism and a particular practice ~ Mindfulness Meditation. The title and text could be seen as misleading, for the treatment could apply to similar practices in some other wisdom paths, as well as in Buddhism itself. The focus, likewise, was not broad enough to prove Buddhism is true, especially as Buddhism is a broad movement with much diversity within particular schools of Buddhism and among the major traditions. The title does not reflect the focus of the text. However, the author laid out his plan early and remained with it, and on occasion noting what he was saying was not true only of the particular focus of practice he chose. The author remained true throughout to his affirmation of naturalistic-Darwinian evolution. He wrote with a confidence on the matter many would question. For those who may not espouse Darwinian evolution or even any strand of evolutionary thought, the book has much to offer, for most of the conclusions prove valid regardless of whether one espouses evolution. I agree the author, regardless, demonstrated the practical significance and scientific validity of much of Buddhism's general worldview and of Mindfulness Meditation. This book is of value for both Buddhists and non-Buddhists interested in the interface between science, meditation, consciousness, and a path to compassion to foster our living together on this planet in blessing of all sentient beings, human and otherwise."
266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/98813722-oscar-delaney,Rating 5 out of 5,"I think this is the only way Buddhism could have been presented to me to be at all plausible or attractive: without the mystical bells and smells, smoke and mirrors, but rather presented as just a collection of empirical and conceptual theories about how the world works.I think the most important message here is that, in an odd way given the 'not-self' doctrine, we actually can have far more power over our inner lives than we imagine. So paradoxically, by realising how we are causally impinged on by the world at large and that there is no central, authoritative, detached 'I', we can choose to separate ourselves from feelings and thoughts of less value to us, and hence develop greater, truer freedom.It is easy to be swept away in the feelings of the moment, indeed we have been designed to do just that, but it is useful to pause and note that I am not my feelings and I can choose to distance 'myself' from them.I also very much identify with the Fundamental Attribution Error whereby I overestimate the deliberateness, often callousness, and intentionality with which people act. In reality I think Wright's version is closer to the truth than the mental model it is easy for me to slip into where everyone (else) knowingly causes or allows immense suffering by eg necessitating the killing of animals, or facilitating the deaths of poor humans for want of globally just healthcare. Most people are pretty unreflective and unremarkable and good, at least in their own narrow, flawed, warped worldview. How different am I, I wonder?"

Wright doesn't generally make extravagant claims, at least not without backing them up with a lot of experiential and scientific and philosophical background, but he makes a persuasive case for the incredible power of mindfulness meditation. He breaks down Buddhist philosophy in a really compelling way--not the more supernatural religious elements, but the basic idea that we don't see our world clearly and that seeing it more clearly leads to more goodness and truth. And he uses his evolutionary psychology background to explain why we are designed to view the world through the lens of delusion. I appreciated that he addressed every pragmatic or skeptical thought I had--for example, he addresses the concern that you might become so detached from your emotions and tribal impulses that not only would your hatred and anger and judgments lessen but so would your affection and closeness to your loved ones. (His answer: achieving critical distance from your emotions will allow you to choose which ones to focus on and cultivate, not abandon emotion altogether.) Overall the science was really interesting, the philosophy was appealing, and he makes a great case for incorporating a little or a lot of mindfulness meditation into anybody's life."
268,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Interesting read which explores the principles of Buddhism (Theravada school) in the context of the author’s own experience of mindfulness meditation. The author connects meditation to behaviors which are driven by feelings which themselves have been formed by the evolutionary process. Sometimes the explanations seem to be unnecessarily lengthy, but other than that I found this book to be a good bridge between mindfulness meditation practice and the evidence gathered from psychology experiments and how evolution has shaped our minds and behaviors.This passage from the book sums it up pretty well: “The human brain is a machine designed by natural selection to respond in pretty reflexive fashion to the sensory input impinging on it, it is designed, in a certain sense, to be controlled by that input. And a key cog in the machinery of control is the feelings that arise in response to the input. If you interact with those feelings via Tanya - via the natural, reflexive thirst to the unpleasant feelings- you will continue to be controlled by the world around you. But if you observe those feelings mindfully rather than just reacting to them, you can in some measure escape the control; the causes that ordinarily shape your behavior can be defied, and you can get closer to the unconditioned.”"

O susijungia jos į kažką tokio: tai, kaip mes mąstome ir elgiamės yra nulemta natūraliosios atrankos ir optimizuota ne kuo aiškesniam realybės suvokimui, o giminės pratęsimui. Tai dažnai veda į įvairias iliuzijas – didžioji dauguma žmonių manosi esą geresni nei vidutiniškai, kitų žmonių blogus darbus priskiriame jų charakteriui, savus – atsitiktinumui ir t.t. Meditacija mus moko stebėti savyje vykstančius procesus, jų nevertinti. Kartu galima pamažu išmokti mažiau vertinti aplinką, kitus žmones – priimti juos su mažiau iliuzijų.

Thankfully, even though this book's title is somewhat clickbaity,the contents are fundamentally well-reasoned, nuanced, and intelligent. And Wright is a great author to boot. The book explains how we can apply key Buddhist ideas, such as the concepts of no-self and emptiness, to our own lives, thus saving us from much of the suffering and discontent that we experience as a result of over-attachment to the material conditions of every day life. Wright's descriptions of what he calls ""naturalistic"" Buddhism—as opposed to ""religious"" Buddhism, a useful distinction to make given that the Buddhism practiced in much of Southeast and South Asia has very little to do with the philosophical, mindful, and scientific Buddhism that Wright is describing—communicate clearly about how the practices that he was exposed to through vipassana meditation have helped bring an ease and comfort into his life that can only be found through lessening attachment."
271,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"The title, “Why Buddhism is True” can be off putting at first by declaring this method of thought as “true.” However, true is subjective and everyone’s truth may be different than the next person. True in this sense is more of a theory that has yet to be proven wrong, such as natural selection. It is a working scientific theory that has not contradicted itself yet with advances in science and thought. This book bases the Buddha’s teachings or dharma off of natural selection theory. Personally, I subscribe to this theory and find it valid (as it has not been contradicted yet). Wright does an excellent job pairing the two modes of thought, Buddhism and natural selection, and explaining how they parallel and complement each other scientifically and philosophically.My only caveat with this book is Wright’s use of personal anecdote. The personal experience may have some influence but it should not be taken as gospel. Anecdotal evidence may have some bearing in philosophy because it’s an area where science hasn’t developed a schema yet for accurate data and repeatable results. In conclusion, this is a wonderful book that I will come back to read when I need to brush up on secular Buddhist philosophy. Wright touches upon main Buddhists concepts such as non-attachment, not-self, and emptiness. He describes them in an easy and relatable tone. His voice is clear throughout the book which I appreciate. "

People do things for reasons, and this book offers a no-nonsense, convincing (at least to me) rationale for adopting a meditation practice and studying the dharma.Even better, the author presents some fascinating ideas about evolutionary biology's relationship to Buddhist insights about the mind. Here's one example that really stuck with me.There's experimental evidence that consciousness consists not of a motivating force behind our actions, but of an observer whose function is just to construct narratives about our actions. Wright supposes that consciousness is adaptive mainly inasmuch as it lets us convince others – and ourselves – that we are clear thinkers who should be trusted. I find this theory extra interesting because it would mean that human consciousness and language are even more deeply interwoven than I had believed.Anyway, good book."

Mind you, this was during the pandemic shut-downs, mass social protests, etc., so it was not so easy to focus. I loved the insights into Buddhism and psychology, as lenses for parsing the human condition. Much of the psychology was familiar to me, much of the Buddhist philosophy was not, except for the broad strokes. I enjoyed some of the deeper dives, but found that just as he was getting to the heart of things he would veer back toward simplifying things or making the nuance seem less important. I really am pro-therapy and self-knowledge, but something about self-helpy books really turns me off. This book has enough intellectual content for so many volumes, but I found something about the way he wrote it strayed into the self-help genre a bit too much. Or, I guess at times he was a bit too jaunty, too casual, too approachable. Now, I very much appreciated how much work must have gone into making some of these ideas simple, but some of the beauty of them is that they are not simple, but complex, elegant, multi-faceted. Worth reading for the insights, even though the register of the prose style, intended for a general audience (perhaps at an editor's suggestion) was not too my liking. I can live with that. "

BUT I found the intersection of evolutionary psychology and (Western, secular) Buddhism to be incredibly valuable and revelatory. Wright details how Buddhist teachings and a mindfulness meditation practice can help a person see the world more clearly, unclouded by the delusions that natural selection put into our consciousness to make us better at getting our genes to the next generation (ex why social anxiety was useful in hunter gatherer societies but is now often a hindrance to seeing our relationships with others clearly). Reading this alone, without a mindfulness meditation practice, already has me considering things differently. (Am I thinking my thoughts or are my thoughts thinking themselves? mostly the latter.) I also love that Wright frames this shift in mindset as a way to see others more clearly, more connected to us, and therefore more kindly and forgivingly.

The author doesn’t profess to have all the answers but patiently walks the reader through his interpretation (which makes sense in a lot of ways than not) of one section of Buddhism that shares a similar point of view with other religions like Hinduism, as to how being more mindful of ones thoughts and feelings is the only meaningful path to achieve “nirvana”.

I'd recommend this book for someone interested in learning why humans act the way they do (the author has written a lot about evolutionary psychology) and how we can override certain behaviors that cause undue suffering.

Entre 2018 y 2020, me sumergí en un estudio riguroso de las filosofías budistas, incorporando a mi vida diaria algunos de sus principios desprovistos de elementos sobrenaturales. Durante ese mismo periodo, también dediqué tiempo al estudio del taoísmo, una filosofía oriental que me resultó notablemente intrigante. Y, sin comprometerme con ninguna de las dos religiones y manteniendo siempre un enfoque secular, de este enriquecimiento dual conseguí extraer sus principios más relevantes y aplicables para mí. Al mirar retrospectivamente, considero este periodo una fase especialmente gratificante en términos de mi bienestar mental. Volviendo al budismo, los conceptos y las técnicas psicológicas adquiridos durante este tiempo contribuyeron sustancialmente a un estado mental más sereno y centrado, demostrando la utilidad práctica de algunas enseñanzas budistas.Mientras leía el libro experimenté una sensación de déjà vu, como si estuviera escuchando una grabación de mis propias reflexiones de los años mencionados, cuando tenía un podcast y un blog en los que abordaba temas similares a los que presenta el autor. En este libro, Robert Wright ofrece una exposición lúcida y secular de la filosofía del budismo. Aborda con destreza los conceptos más fundamentales, disipando conceptos erróneos y mitos comunes que a menudo oscurecen la comprensión occidental de esta tradición. Especialmente notable es su discusión de las meditaciones de atención plena y Vipassana, dos meditaciones que a menudo se confunden erróneamente debido a su similitud y que pueden servir como valiosas herramientas en la búsqueda del bienestar humano. El autor también añade un interesante matiz académico al indagar en algunos estudios de la psicología y la neurociencia, comparando sus hallazgos con muchas de las cosas que el budismo lleva diciendo desde hace milenios. Además, su inclusión de experiencias personales ofrece consuelo a quienes puedan encontrar dificultades en sus primeros pasos hacia la meditación o la filosofía budista.

282,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Loved this book (4.5 stars?). Combines mindfulness and natural selection, mixed with moral code. Thesis is that naturalistic Buddhism came up with the correct approach (mindful meditation) for overcoming many of the unnecessary or more harmful feelings/thoughts that are necessary for survival of your genes, but may not be good for peace and happiness in current environment - without knowing what it was solving for! Not a lot of research to back this up, but for the most part, it would be overkill if it were included since this book is the author's own thoughts on how natural selection and mindfulness work together. The book's conclusions are primarily formed by the author's prior research and writings on natural selection and his lived-experience of mindfulness. Thought provoking, pragmatic, humorous and enjoyable. "

I worry this could turn away readers who are religiously committed elsewhere, when few of the insights here conflict with other western and eastern traditions.Nonetheless, it's a great book and incorporates a balanced mix of psychology and hard science/evolution to support the arguments and explanations. Had I not read a few books prior that had already convinced me of much of the material here, I quite likely would have considered it a 5 star book. So much to get out of meditation, and something that the world and especially my past self looks on like something weird and necessarily esoteric."

So it actually took multiple sittings to get through this and every time I came back to the book it needed a bit of a recap to get the context. At the heart of it you can say this is scientific defense of some of the core principles of Buddhism and comes with rich cross-referencing of scholarly material from fields of psychology, neuroscience and even behavioral sciences.I found the first few chapters on why we are wired the way we are, the most impactful. For instance one of the primary goals of natural selection is to ensure that you can perpetuate your genes to the next generation and that goal can explain several of our behavioral traits. A lot of the advice on meditation, feelings etc I am sure you would have read before if this genre interests you. I struggled a bit with the parts about ‘non-self’ etc because those ideas are a bit abstract. "
285,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6036690-mack,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is the best book I’ve read on Buddhism to date. Part of that is due to Wright taking a more accessible tact for the spiritually skeptical; the goal here isn’t to convince you reincarnation is real or if there are bodhisattvas living among us, but merely to demonstrate how the moral and meditative teachings of Buddhism are pragmatic, beneficial, and extremely helpful in leading a more clearheaded and compassionate life. Viewing all this through the lens of evolutionary psychology really helps you realize just how many cognitive biases natural selection wired into us and our need to liberate ourselves from them and rewire our perception of the world. My favorite thing about Buddhism is how commonsensical and self-evident a lot of the teachings are and this book is the best introduction I’ve come across to tell you why."
286,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14741934-katy,Rating 3 out of 5,"Wright analyzes the Eastern religion through a Western lens, which might make it more accessible to those who aren't from Asia. However, the analysis is at times awkward and difficult to understand fully because Buddhism defies Western explanation. If you're like me and from somewhere like the United States, you'll have to reread (and still struggle to grasp) some very foreign parts of this book. Nonetheless, Wright offers powerful insight on the wisdom of Buddhism, which stands a real chance at helping people live fuller and happier lives. If you've ever struggled to find happiness, control your emotions, or feel contentment, check out this book. Spoiler alert: the relentless pursuit of money, acclaim, and more possessions produces fleeting moments of joy that don't sustain us. There's something liberating about letting go of this Western mindset, and that liberation, according to Wright, can be found in Buddhism and meditation. "
287,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17448204-tom-cummings,Rating 4 out of 5,"If the old adage that you can't judge a book by its cover is true, is it also true that you can't judge a book by its title? Ordinarily, I would answer ""yes"" to both assertions. In my experience, neither an appealing cover nor a clever (or, for that matter, a dull) title can accurately predict what awaits the reader inside the cover and below the title. But in the case of Robert Wright's latest book, the title phrase ""why Buddhism is true"" is insistent enough to command our attention, and controversial enough to invite our judgment, before we so much as open the book's cover. Wright surmised as much himself, and so he opens with ""a note to readers"" in which he offers an explanation of his title. One is immediately charmed by the unpretentious candor of the note's opening paragraph: ""Any book with a title like Why Buddhism Is True should have some careful qualification along the way. We might as well get that over with [right now]."" There follow five paragraphs, only the fourth of which seriously grapples with the problematic word ""true"". After first admitting that Buddhism teaches us to be skeptical that our imperfect ways of apprehending the world are capable of showing us the truth of anything, he then argues that since the Buddha's most famous discourse is called ""The Four Noble Truths"" it might indeed be permissible to use the word ""true"" in discussing Buddhism.Hmmm. Not too convincing an argument to this reader - nor, I would venture to guess, to the growing number of practitioners who count themselves as secular Buddhists, and for whom assertions of ""truth"" creep uncomfortably close to declarations of religious faith. We secular practitioners take seriously the Buddha's reported admonition to the monks who followed him that they were not to believe that something was true just because he said so, but rather that they should believe only what their own experience showed them was true. And we secular practitioners also take seriously Stephen Batchelor's argument in his recent book After Buddhism (interestingly enough, a book Wright includes in his impressive bibliography, but seems not to be in full agreement with) that there is a strong case to be made that the expression ""Four Noble Truths"" was never uttered by the Buddha, and that a far more appropriate translation for the expression he did use would be ""The Four Tasks"". But enough quibbling over this introductory note. For now, let's give Wright partial credit for at least addressing the issue up front, and let's also stand by our opening promise not to judge a book's merit by either its cover or its title. And so, let's move on to a consideration of this book's content, and of its author's intent.When we do move into the body of the book, we discover that Wright has brought his considerable mastery of multiple but related fields of knowledge - including evolutionary psychology, natural selection, philosophy (particularly, and very rewardingly, the writings of David Hume), and the current state of experimental research in neuroscience - all to bear upon his growing understanding of the classic teachings of Buddhism and the value of mindfulness meditation, of which he has been an enthusiastic practitioner for the past fifteen years. Surprisingly, Wright's enthusiasm for his meditation practice can sometimes cross over from charming to cloying, as in the early chapters he shares far too many trivial anecdotes from his early retreat experiences. But tiresome as they inevitably become, these candid observations allow us to feel both the earnestness and the humility that he brings to his practice. And this in turn prepares us to more readily receive the crucial message that he intends to deliver with this book. His thesis, boiled down to the shortest sentence I can devise for it, is as follows: that the process of natural selection, obeying the genetic imperative of assuring the survival of the gene from each generation to the next, has resulted in human behaviors bound to cause suffering; that centuries ago, the Buddha had a brilliant insight into the nature of this innate human suffering and how it might be alleviated; and that both contemporary neuroscience and current world conditions point unmistakably to the validity of the Buddha's insight and to the urgent necessity for humanity to begin following his teachings.This thesis is convincingly developed through each of the book's sixteen chapters, and is brought to a powerful apex in its penultimate chapter, in a four-page passage to which Wright assigns the poignant heading ""A Brief History of Life"". In it, he discusses the alarming rise of tribalism across the globe, and the extreme forms of hatred this phenomenon is spawning. Here's an excerpt:""What causes all the hatred? It's always the same thing: human beings operating under the influence of human brains whose design presupposed their specialness … convincing us that we and ours are in the right, that we are by nature good … whereas they and theirs aren't in the right and aren't by nature good.""We need to reject the core evolutionary value of the specialness of self. There's probably never been a time in human history when this rejection was more vital. … Buddhism deserves credit for so early, so acutely, and so systematically diagnosing the problem and for offering such a comprehensive prescription.""Nothing in the above two paragraphs asserts that Buddhism is true. But every word in them attests to why it's of such import. The same goes for the book in its entirety.And that's why ""Why Buddhism Is True"" is deserving of a wide readership, and why Wright's intention for this book is of far greater significance than the title he has chosen for it."
288,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84738691-santiago,Rating 5 out of 5,"One of the best books on Buddhism. Robert Wright connects the theory of the modularity of the mind, with what Buddhism's teachings are, drawing a parallel that might insinuate that science is finding hints of what has otherwise been described in(some of) the teachings of Buddhism and can be experienced throughout meditation. He spends significant time explaining the concepts of no-self, the role of feelings, the view from the universe, what Essence is, and how all of that is connected into a coherent whole. He also describes how our struggles are possibly originated with evolutionary adaptations (darwinism) and that conquering them might be the path to attaining Enlightenment (or at least a less conditioned, and more happy, life).Overall, I find the book to be written in a way that skeptical, yet open, minds will find reassuring. It's helpful to have had some personal experiences with meditation. It's a great book for those of us who are drawn into this philosophy because it 'rings true' but appreciate the comfort of having some science behind it. "

Here are a couple of quotes about meditation I found useful:-Why meditate?""Meditation can weaken the link between perceptions and thoughts, on the one hand, and the feelings, the affective resonances, that typically accompany them on the other. Well, if you do a really thorough job of that weakening, and perceptions become increasingly free of affective associations, this could change your view of the world.""How to use meditation to reduce unwanted feelings:""RAIN. First you Recognize the feeling. Then you Accept the feeling (rather than try to drive it away). Then you Investigate the feeling and its relationship to your body. Finally, the N stands for Nonidentification, or, equivalently, Nonattachment. Which is a nice note to end on, since not being attached to things was the Buddha’s all-purpose prescription for what ails us""."

I guess ""the similarities between Western psychological theories and Buddhist teachings on mindfulness, non-self and emptiness"" wouldn't have been as catchy! The Buddhism that Wright expounds the truth of is very much a secular Western Buddhism, although he is quite open about this and admits that he doesn't call himself a Buddhist and doesn't believe in Buddhist teachings on karma and rebirth nor engage in the more religious/ritualistic aspeects of traditional Buddhism. Nevertheless, he makes a compelling case for the benefits of meditation and this is a thought-provoking read."

Some background: I got it at the same time that I bought Owen Flanagan's The Bodhisattva's Brain, and I expected there to be a more direct connection between these two books (since they're both about a naturalized form of Buddhism). And in some sense, Wright's book is the one that Flanagan worried about: Flanagan spends a lot of time talking about how we might define, e.g., happiness, how we might empirically measure increases in happiness and how that may - or may not - be correlated with meditating... Well, Wright plunges on ahead without worrying too much about that. However, the first-person narrative that comes out of the book is compelling, partly because the sources of dissatisfaction that Wright describes will probably be familiar to most of his readers; and the fact that meditation has helped quiet them is significant, even as he does spend a fair amount of time qualifying his conclusions. What I wasn't expecting was for this book to remind me of Pollan's How to Change Your Mind. ""I found a way to quiet the Default Mode Network - our rigid sense of self - and it was liberating."" "

His way of detailing Buddhism’s relevance was succinct and direct, whilst providing aspects of Buddhism he also didn’t believe strongly in.

This time, I went with the audio book version, and I was better able to engage with some parts of it. However, I felt like the psychological theory explanations (fundamental attribution error, modular theory of mind, etc.) were unnecessary and took away from the appeal of the book. In contrast, I wish it included more information about other aspects of Buddhism beyond meditation. The book just wasn’t what I thought it would be, I suppose.

Wright builds a methodical, cogent argument for the parallels between modern/evolutionary psychology/biology and Buddhism, arguing that what Buddhist have known for centuries is what modern science has discovered about how we evolved as humans. Buddhism, in other words, is both the prescription and the cure for what ails modern humans. If you've ever wanted to better understand Buddhism or meditation, this is an excellent place to start; Wright does an outstanding job of explaining complicated and esoteric concepts plainly."

It also discussed the modularity of the mind, and the question of whether an ""I"" really exists (""thoughts think themselves."") One of my favorite questions posed by Wright was: If a feeling arises as a product of natural selection, but is no longer relevant in the modern world, is that feeling an illusion? In addition to giving me lots to think about, it also inspires me to continue the yoga practice I have taken up in the past 11 days, look into attending a silent meditation retreat or meditation workshop, and to try to be more mindful in my day to day life.

Wright brings a lot to the discussion from evolutionary theory and psychology which are very helpful in describing what might be going on during vipassana (‘insight’) meditation. The idea of the ‘modular mind’ in his discussion of no-self in buddhist thought is a key insight. His examples from the point of view of a beginning meditator both on retreat and during daily life fit very well with my own.

How Wright interviews Buddhism with evolutionary psychology appeals to the nerdy psychologist in me. The concepts are pretty accessible, applicable and appealing. I really appreciated how he shared personal and evidence based claims about meditation while also naming the continuous struggles and lackluster processes involved. Meditation is touted as a panacea for personal and world ills and Wright brought it down to a more realistic, humbling, and hard perspective.

320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53689026-omar-delawar,Rating 4 out of 5,"We see the world through the distorting lens of natural selection - that's the central idea in Wright's enlightening book - but what is good for getting our genes passed onto the next generation (all that natural selection cares about) does not necessarily make for the good life. However, many centuries ago Buddhism came up with a way to look beyond our knee jerk reactions of attraction and repulsion. It is called mindfulness meditation and Wright adds modern knowledge from neuroscience and psychology to show how we can have a truer sense of our best interests and thereby gain more self-control.Secular, naturalistic Buddhism rests on a few key ideas: the idea that people don't have an essential 'self' (no-self), the idea that dissatisfaction (dukkha) is caused by the 'hedonic treadmill' of pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain, and that meditation can help us to get off this treadmill. The philosophical approach is similar to that of Stephen Batchelor in Confession of a Buddhist Atheist and Secular Buddhism: Imagining the Dharma in an Uncertain World.There is a decidedly Gnostic bent to the writing here, right from the beginning, when the movie The Matrix is cited. Here natural selection is the process which holds us in a state of delusion, warps our perceptions of reality, prevents us from experiencing lasting contentment and satisfaction, and keeps us trapped on the hedonic treadmill. And secular-Buddhism is The Way (the 'red pill') that will liberate us from this endless drama of delusion and frustration. This view of evolution stands in marked contrast with that of Wright's previous book, The Evolution of God (Back Bay Readers' Pick), in which biological and cultural evolution are instead 'divine' processes by which the Good becomes manifest in the world. (The God-as-Evolution view is also that of the 'Integral' spirituality of Ken Wilber, Steve McIntosh, and others.)Part of this book is dedicated to showing that the key ideas of secular-Buddhism are scientifically true, through discussion of studies in psychology and neuroscience (an approach shared with Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion, by Sam Harris). This would be more convincing if the studies were cited as a way of evaluating Buddhism against competing theories of well-being, such as modern positive psychology, but the book generally avoids this type of direct comparison. This is reflective of the basic approach of secular-Buddhism: the concepts which don't find support in scientific studies, such as reincarnation, or lasting enlightenment, are abandoned or de-emphasized. Secular-Buddhism is reformulating Buddhism to be more consistent with modern psychology, a dynamic which complicates the question of whether science can be used to show that 'Buddhism is True'.Wright expands on the concept of 'no-self' by presenting a 'modular' model of the mind. The idea is that our mind is composed of modules with different goals, desires, and thought patterns. The modules jostle and compete with each other on the subconscious level. Only when one of them carries a sufficiently strong feeling, do we then become aware of its associated thought on a conscious level. While Wright finds some support for this modular model from the Insight Meditation school, and from psychological research, he formulates it through his own preferred perspective of evolutionary psychology (Darwinian competition within the subconscious mind). Interestingly, the model is extended to suggest how mindfulness can improve our 'self'-control, and to weaken the pull of indulgent or addictive behavior.One of the pleasures of The Evolution of God was its detailed historical examples of the ways in which the 'spiritual marketplace' of competing ideas, and the needs of merchants, kings, and rulers all influenced the development of ancient Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Wright could have also taken this approach with Buddhism, exploring how its history as the state religion of multiple empires has shaped its development over time and place. I was hoping for this, and am disappointed not to find it here. However, Wright instead manages to tackle some pretty subtle philosophical issues, such as the distinction between the Buddhist concept of 'emptiness' (sunyata) and Hindu non-dualism, in a manner that is unusually accessible. He enlivens the discussion with narrative accounts of past conversations and interviews.This book is in many ways a personal account: Wright has found a version of secular-Buddhism that is True for him in his life, and he is bringing us along through his experience and thought process. Unlike many authors on Eastern spirituality, he is in no way trying to present himself as enlightened, or a spiritual teacher or guru. He is refreshingly unpretentious--humorously self-effacing, and transparent about his motivations for writing. And he is a clear writer--he does not try to intimidate us with obtuseness and paradox, even when addressing difficult concepts. The book is not always convincing, but it is engaging, approachable, and thought-provoking. It will stay with me for a long time and I recommend to others who want to take the red pill and see the 'truth'."
321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40877782-leigh-ann,Rating 5 out of 5,I actually really enjoyed this book far more than I anticipated. The topic of psychology is absolutely fascinating to me especially in terms of spiritual practices. I learnt so much from this book and it allowed me to think about my own perspective and mindfulness practices in a new light.
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21839317-evan,Rating 5 out of 5,2/50 for 2021. Review incorporated into my blog post on Mindfulness and secular Buddhism: https://evankmccarthy.com/2021/01/11/...Stunning book written by one of the writers/thinkers I value most. 
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59120008-ariel-calsch,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’d guessed this book would be about brain scans/evidence based effects of meditation, but it’s actually an evolutionary psychology based exploration, touching on intersections with western philosophy, that was fairly engaging. I lost interest a couple of times but the kernel of the book I think will stick with me. "

325,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Great book, an excellent analysis of how modern psychology increasingly aligns with the core concepts of Buddhism. For anyone interested, I would highly recommend his free, online course 'Buddhism and Modern Psychology' that he references!"
326,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82786859-amanda-rose,Rating 4 out of 5,I’d say this was less focused on Buddhism and more focused on the benefits of meditation and “observing” our feelings and the cause/effect our environment has on us. Still a great spiritual read that I might listen to again in the future for certain helpful chapters

This book covers the strikingly accurate claims (as judged by modern psychologists) made by the Buddha regarding the habits, practices, and beliefs that make life meaningful."
329,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book was great. I liked how the author methodically worked through some of the ideas of meditation and Buddhism. It reminded me of a mathematical proof. Some of the ideas are super abstract, so it was useful to do it in this way, but the level of abstractness also made it slightly hard to get through. I did it though and am now enlightened af"
