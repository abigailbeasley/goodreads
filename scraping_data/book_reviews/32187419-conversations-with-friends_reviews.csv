0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have a debilitating rereading problem.It’s reached a concerning point -- seemingly 1 in 3 or 4 books I read is actually a reread. Previously I was way too picky about adding books to my to-read list to suffer a massive TBR issue, but now that I’m barely reading new books, the pile (which is a physical one in the corner of my room, stacked by color because a) rainbow shelves forever and b) I am out of shelf space) is looming. Concerningly.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...If I die mysteriously, I was probably crushed by the blue stack. (I also seem to have a problem with buying blue books, specifically.)Anyway. My sole limit has always been that I must wait at least one year after my initial read before reading it again. This is my last shred of rereading-related logic and sanity.This book smashed that sh*t to pieces. Less than five months after I read it for the first time, I was rereading.I could make excuses. “My flight was delayed and I only brought one book, ” I could say, and it would be true (and a fatal mistake and a shame upon my bookworm title). “I happened to have this one because the person I lent it to gave it back.” But it was a nighttime flight, and I finished my first book on board, and I had to go out of my way to turn on that reading light that is really more of a goddamn chandelier considering how well it illuminates everything in an eight-foot radius. (Sorry, everyone around me.)Also, it was a short flight and I only got 50 or so pages into it. I easily could have put it down.This is where it’s the book’s fault.This story is not action-packed, nor particularly suspenseful. Neither is it jam full of what you’d call Exciting Events or even a traditional love story that gets you rooting for your couple in any familiar way.In spite of all that, it is absolutely unputdownable.Conversations with Friends, if you are one of the few who somehow haven’t read it yet, is about Frances and, less so, her best friend and ex-girlfriend Bobbi. Frances is thoughtful and cool (in the less-used definition of the word, according to my lexicon), Bobbi is effervescent and charming. They encounter a married couple, Melissa and Nick, and much of the novel is devoted to the changing ways in which the four interact with each other. The writing is beautiful. Sally Rooney’s style is clean and sharp and true. Each word is thoughtfully chosen. Each image feels real and complex. Her New Yorker profile (which I read in a fit of desperately needing to get my hands on everything Rooney has written, in the wake of my first encounter with this book) highlights a description of a party at Melissa’s home as “full of music and people wearing long necklaces.” Conversations is teeming with terse, evocative descriptions like that, and if you’re anything like me once you start reading writing like that you’ll never want to stop.Being forced to stop by the dearth of Sally Rooney material has been very difficult for me.Like the writing, the characterization is somehow spare and complete at once. Frances and Bobbi, Melissa and Nick, even the background actors and extras of their lives are stunningly real. I think about Frances and Nick especially all the time. I can identify statements in life as “very Bobbi” or “exactly Melissa” or “totally something Frances would say.”Above all, this book crawled inside my head and stayed there. It ever-so-slightly changed the way my brain works, but mostly it made me feel noticed and heard. It seems a way of looking at the world I hadn’t realized I ascribed to is captured in these pages. It’s surprising and kind of spooky and I’m truly grateful I encountered this book at all.Lastly, it wouldn’t be a review of mine if I didn’t confidently write about something I’m likely not qualified to. And I want to say f*ck everybody who acts like Sally Rooney is some kind of lesser writer because she’s young and a woman. There’s a difference between saying “this writer is not for me” and “I didn’t like this book, and therefore everyone who calls her brilliant or talented is actually wrong.”You don’t spew that sh*t about the bajillion dead white male writers. Your internalized misogyny and ageism is showing.Bottom line: Sally Rooney is brilliant and talented.

1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52545435-elle-ellexamines,Rating 5 out of 5,"There’s a cliche in reviewing where you say something along these lines: “I wouldn’t like these characters in real life, but I found them compelling.” See, I don’t think that’s why this book works. I think this book works because in real life we would probably like these characters; respect their talent, find them interesting if at times flawed or condescending, look up to them on a level at which we would at times resent them and at times want to be them. It’s just that none of us would ever know these characters, because these characters do not want to be known.

“You underestimate your own power so you don't have to blame yourself for treating other people badly.”

Conversations with Friends is a book about four people: two ex-girlfriends and best friends, Frances and Bobbi, and a married couple, Nick and Melissa. Frances and Nick end up falling, over time, into a strange romance. But… it’s not about the cheating. The book refuses to make it that simple. Bobbi and Melissa have their own strange connection, as do Frances and Bobbi, as do Nick and Melissa, of course; the six connections within this circle are all given both pagetime and weight within the narrative. On some level, we’re not rooting for any one of these characters over the others; we see the complex levels on which any ending for these four would be painful. At times, I disliked all four of these characters; at times, I loved all four. But at all times, they felt real.There is a scene in this book in which Frances goes home to her father and plays nice and awkward for an afternoon, and looking into a dishwasher, feels “a sudden impulse to harm herself.” It is small and brief and a throwaway line and yet it felt so vivid, so real, that I was unable to pull out of my head the feeling of standing there waiting for the storm to come, desperately, and suddenly feeling as though the world will come apart if you do not hurt yourself physically, a sign of how your insides are being torn apart.There’s a line where Frances says she enjoys talking to Nick because he gives her unconditional empathy, while Bobbi “applies her standards” about the world to conversations about Frances. I don’t know why that hit so hard I just know that it did?There’s this quote from a New York Times oped that I think about a lot:Frances’ central conflict, as we learn over the course of this book, is that she is unable to allow others to see her vulnerability, to see that she cares for them or is hurt by them or even that she simply enjoys their company. She wishes to be cool and distant and yet still utterly lovable. 

“The acclaim also felt like part of the performance itself, the best part, and the most pure expression of what I was trying to do, which was to make myself into this kind of person: someone worthy of praise, worthy of love.”

The problem is that we need to allow ourselves to be known to be truly loved. It is this refusal to submit to intimacy that becomes the primary conflict of the book; in her relationship with Bobbi, with Nick, and even with Melissa, she constantly attempts (with increasing desperation) to refuse any breaking of her walls. It is only as the book continues that she begins to understand others do love her, and want to know her. SOME OF MY FURTHER FAVORITE MOMENTS:▷“Maybe he just likes to act passive so he doesn’t have to take the blame for anything.”▶“It was more that Nick’s sympathy seemed unconditional, whereas Bobbi had strong principles that she applied to everyone, me included.” ▷“I feel like I should thank you for making me a tolerable person to live with.”▶“I wonder if we gravitate toward Nick because he gives us a sense of control that was lacking in childhood.”▷“To him, my arm was not important. He was only concerned with making his child feel bad, making her feel ashamed.”▶“I’m a bad mother, she said, that’s what you’re saying. If that’s the conclusion you draw from the facts, that’s your business, I said. She told me I had never loved my father anyway. According to you the only way to love someone is to let them treat you like shit, I said.”▷“When you broke up with me I felt you beat me at a game we were playing together, and I wanted to come back and beat you. Now I think I just want to sleep with you, without metaphors.”▶“Is it possible we could develop an alternative model of loving each other? I’m not drunk. Please write back. I love you.” ▷“But it’s harder to work out who has the power, so instead we rely on ‘niceness’ as a kind of stand-in.”▶“But at some level I still see you as the person who broke my heart and left me unfit for normal relationships.” “You underestimate your own power so you don’t have to blame yourself for treating other people badly. You tell yourself stories about it.”

“I had the sense that something in my life had ended, my image of myself as a whole or normal person maybe.”

This is a book made up of tiny moments of humanity, of vulnerability and tenderness. We see these characters hold up their walls at almost every moment to the point that any moment of tenderness or kindness between them feels like a revelation. I cried several times, barely knowing why; I just knew I hurt for these characters. This one will stay with me for a long, long time.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram | Spotify | Youtube"
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59357213-sam,Rating 2 out of 5,"I didn't really respond well to Conversations with Friends. The writing itself is quite good in terms of realistic dialogue and description, but I found all of the characters entirely unlikable and hard to empathize with, very few with any positive animating traits, mostly just self-absorbed, narcissistic, occasionally cruel and capricious. Either in addition to or because I didn't respond to the characters, I also didn't respond to the plot well: the stakes seemed very low, there seemed to be little personal growth from any of the characters (despite this being a story entirely focused on people rather than situations), and when more or less the entire main cast is unlikable, it can be hard to invest in an outcome. Because the craft itself was strong, I'd give this 2 stars and say ""it's ok"" overall, but I wouldn't recommend it personally.The central conceit is two twenty-something friends and former lovers, Frances and Bobbi, get pulled into the orbit of photographer Melissa and her actor husband Nick. Then France and Nick become drawn to one another, and begin an affair that leads to uncomfortable situations and confrontations with Bobbi, Melissa, and their friends and family members. It's set in Dublin, Ireland, but the way it's written and the poetry-art-acting cultural trifecta it hits, it may as well be set in California. It didn't feel particularly Irish at all, so I was a bit lost on sense of place and specificity.We see things from Frances' perspective, which might be part of the difficulty with this read for me. Frances is entirely selfish: she begins the book that way, and aside from maybe inches of character growth, she also ends the book that way. We're told how intelligent she is, but she seems to be perpetually blushing, blundering into things, acting cruelly and capriciously when it suits her, and retreating to dark corners to cut herself when she's incapable of expressing her true feelings. It didn't help that Frances is also living off an allowance through her father, not feeling pressed at all to support herself for much of the novel, content to wallow in her feelings for Nick and assert dominance and indifference to him to disguise her growing dependence and obsession with him. (They say it's love, but honestly these characters are all so selfish it's easy to think that they say it's love but it's not.) Nick meanwhile is a somewhat caddish, sad, broken and oppressed man, mildly unhappy with his life but without real power or impetus to change it. Not all characters need to be likable in order to enjoy a novel about them - I can think of plenty of anti-heroes and somewhat nasty characters that are delightful to read - but I struggled greatly trying to empathize with these characters, finding very little compelling about their personalities and their decisions, but also not being poorly behaved enough to be completely disgusted with them. That made it very difficult for me to engage and be entertained or informed while reading. Bobbi is a decent side character and has a greater, more complex personality, while Melissa never comes across as more than a controlling, dominating woman (possibly because we're in Frances' perspective, and Bobbi is her former lover and best friend, while Melissa is her rival for Nick's physical and emotional affection and attention).When the focal point is an illicit, uncertain relationship and the rest centers on other relationships spiraling and changing in reaction, you don't want the writing to put distance between you and the characters. As good as Rooney's craft is, I did feel as though I was peering into their lives and their messy actions but at arms length, and again hard to say if the writing was responsible or my disinterest in the characters. I would want to feel immersed in the action, pulled in and maybe disgusted or titillated or both, but fundamentally unable to look away (very much how I felt reading White Fur). With Conversations with Friends, I was just bored, feeling the distance and not caring that neither myself nor the author was taking pains to close the gap. And the scenes of sex and intimacy did not feel charged or challenged; they seemed pathetic and pitiable, but in the most banal way, so I had little sympathy for Frances or Nick as they embarked on their affair. There's not much more to it: again, it's a novel of relationships, and there aren't huge plot elements or set pieces or massive emotional bombs. It quietly crawls along, never fully climaxes, and resulted in a sort of ambivalent ending that made a lot of sense to me based on the selfishness of these characters. I do believe Sally Rooney has writing talent, and there are some good paragraphs and dialogue in terms of craft. But I could not connect with this book at all, and was too bored by the characters and wearied by the proceedings to hate them. Again, the writing was good enough that I think it warrants two stars, and perhaps other people will find more that speaks to them from this book. But it was absolutely not for me."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’ve been thinking a lot about aging lately: the way our perspective changes and how our need for stability, trust and healthy relationships become so much more valued than intoxicating, crash-and-burn emotional roller-coasters of our younger years.I say this as means of introduction because while reading Conversations with Friends, it occurred to me that those readers who are not familiar with the confusing yet exhilarating times of poor choices mixed with a great deal of egotism and sense of invulnerability may not like or relate to these characters. It’s easy to miss the precision dance that Sally Rooney is performing here.But then is this book about the poor choices of youth or about one particularly fractured character who is destined to keep making those choices into adulthood? The book centers on two girls in their early 20s – our narrator Frances and Bobbi, her best friend and one-time lover. Together, they make the acquaintance of a couple a decade older: the composed and successful Melissa and her handsome husband Nick, an emotionally fragile actor whose career seems to be stalled despite an abundance of talent. Inevitably, Frances and Nick hook up, wrecking more damage on their own world and on the worlds of everyone around them.The “conversations” alluded to in the title are eloquently expressed but never get to the heart of things. Frances, who is unable to admit her love for Nick—even to herself—says, “We can sleep together if you want, but you should know I’m only doing it ironically.” Or later: “I just don’t have feelings concerning whether you fxxk your wife or not. It’s not an emotive topic for me.” Of course it is, and the constant self-harm Frances imposes on herself—picking furiously at her nails, biting her inner cheek, cutting herself—reveals the extent that her repression is harming her.As Frances whirls in place, the product of an alcoholic father, an enabler mother, and her own making, the core of Frances reveals itself: she feels like a damaged person who deserves nothing, believing that those she loves are exalted and somehow special. “Suffering wouldn’t make me special, and pretending not to suffer wouldn’t make me special,” she reflects at one point. To reveal oneself is dangerous in a world that often conspires against you. This is one of the most interesting psychological profiles I’ve read in a long time with an ending that made me gasp."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 3 out of 5,"A very tepid 3 stars. Conversations with Friends is another one of those books about not particularly nice people entangled in awkward relationships. I've certainly read many books of this nature that I've found clever and quite enjoyed, but this one was just ok. Frances and Bobbi -- both young women who used to be in a relationship with each other -- become entangled with somewhat older heterosexual couple Nick and Melissa. It's all told from Frances' perspective. She doesn't seem to be able to figure out what she wants. Nor does anyone else. It gets messy and it stays pretty messy. I was attracted to this one partially because it is set in Dublin, but it could have been anywhere in North America or Europe. I'm at a low three stars because I did enjoy the the first half of Conversations with Friends, but my enjoyment started to wane in the second half. Frances' inner gaze and self-centredness started to feel suffocating. I don't have much more to say. Time to move on to something that makes me less grumpy. Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."

8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137657144-haley-pham,Rating 4 out of 5,4.5 stars!!! My first Sally Rooney book and I really enjoyed seeing the strange inner dialogue of Frances.
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,Rating 3 out of 5,"My controversial take on this book is that it could also be titled Self-absorbed White People have Feelings Too. Before I get into that take, I do think Sally Rooney accomplishes quite a lot with her debut novel Conversations with Friends. The book follows Frances and her best friend Bobbi, who become entangled with a married couple, Nick and Melissa. Frances and Nick begin an affair which gets intense, and much of these characters’ relationships with one another thicken when Bobbi and Melissa find out. Though this set up may sound like a recipe for a pretty shallow book, Rooney’s writing makes the story incredibly interesting. Her dialogue is sharp and compelling even though her characters’ lives are kinda shallow, she describes her characters’ interior lives really well, and because of these qualities I literally stayed up until 1am to finish this novel last night. Rooney also creates a complex and intriguing non-monogamous relationship set up between her four main characters which speaks to the potential of love outside of traditional heterosexual monogamy. Finally, I loved, loved, loved Bobbi as a character, perhaps in large part because she reminded me a lot of me with her self-assuredness and social justice barbs. Kudos to Rooney for creating such a cool, iconic best friend for Frances.The characters’ lack of growth limits my praise for this novel. Rooney does a great job of making pretty narcissistic characters interesting. Even beyond making them interesting, she humanizes them, especially our main character Frances. There are some moments of emotional depth and insight in Conversations with Friends, and when they hit, they’re pretty rad. Yet, I wanted so much more from Frances and from how Rooney constructed Frances’s relationship with Nick. Frances is self-effacing, rather self-centered, and cruel to people she is close to. Her relationship with Nick only heightens these attributes. Toward the end of the book, there’s some acknowledgement that Frances is this way and a few pages of some growth (e.g., apologizing to people she’s hurt), yet I wanted more from her. To be honest, I’m not sure how fair it is that I wanted more from her – like maybe it’s “okay” that she’s kind of a jerk because perhaps that’s how some people are, jerks who at some point become a little less like jerks yet still are emotionally messy. For me, though, the sophistication of the writing and the overall style of characterization obscured what could have been deeper moments of growth for Frances, as well as for Nick. Overall, a super intriguing novel. Even though I didn’t love it I respect its quality enough to the point where I am still considering reading Rooney’s second book, Normal People. In the hands of any other author, I probably would’ve despised this book and felt that it was 300 pages of people with awful interpersonal skills who lack self-awareness. And while I do feel that this book is 300 pages of people with awful interpersonal skills who lack self-awareness, Rooney’s talent makes the story and characters shine in their own self-absorbed way."
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was stupidly good. After recently loving Rooney's sophomore novel Normal People my expectations for Conversations With Friends were high, though I was also a bit wary; in these situations I'm always afraid an author's debut isn't going to live up. I needn't have worried. This was perfect from start to finish. You know that feeling when you miss a stair and your stomach lurches briefly before you land - this was that sensation in book form.Once again I was impressed with Rooney's writing; it's simple and seemingly effortless, but the kind of natural and conversational cadence she achieves is no easy feat. The simultaneous intelligence and lack of life experience of the narrator, Frances, were captured so convincingly; from the start this was a person that I wanted to understand, whose head I wanted to inhabit briefly. Sally Rooney writes about interpersonal dynamics with such skill and ease and sharp observation, and that was the shining point of this novel, but whenever Frances looked inward, those moments were also captured with the same unnerving clarity. I related to Frances and I didn't; I saw bits of myself in her and I found bits of her unreachable. But Rooney made me care, she earned my investment as I watched with sympathy and frustration and anxiety as Frances attempted to navigate an awkward, ill-thought-out affair with an older married man, a dynamic which only complicated her limited understanding of love, class, status, artistic freedom, and belonging.If you can't handle books about unlikable, selfish people, you aren't going to enjoy this, and in that sense alone I don't necessarily believe this book transcends its premise. It's about unlikable, selfish people, many of whom are blind to their privilege. It's not about the kind of people you want to be, or want to be friends with. But if you're willing to sacrifice likability for realism, and an unpredictable plot for moments of startling self-reflection, this is the book for you. I actually ended up preferring this to Normal People, but both are a solid 5 stars and I am simply delighted that Sally Rooney's books have entered my life."
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6431467-s-penkevich,Rating 5 out of 5,"‘Everyone’s always going through something, aren’t they?’I have a—possibly irrational—deep love for this book. Conversations With Friends, the debut novel from Irish author Sally Rooney, is a book that hit the ground running in the literary world with a heated publisher bidding war making news even before it’s release and its instantaneous critical and commercial success making it one of the most talked about books of the year. And deservingly so. Rooney, 26 at the time of publication, has an artistic wit that seemingly finds the pulse on young millennials in order for the novel to beat to the rhythm of said pulse and captures the frustrations and foibles of young adulthood. The two friends central to the novel, Frances and Bobbi, are still traversing the minefield of identity formation as 21 year old college students at Rooney’s own Alma Mater, Trinity College in Dublin. Despite outward appearances projecting certainty and confidence, inside they are weathering a maelstrom of sexuality and self-doubt, thrown a new twist as illicit emotions and affairs flare up after befriending married couple Melissa and Nick. Rooney spins a tangled web of interpersonal relationships between hyper-intellectuals full of shifting and contradictory desires. Rooney is an author where flaws and imperfections are central to what makes the work so beautiful and this is a book of people being people, feeling so raw and alive in Rooney’s hands you wonder if you cut the pages it might bleed. A fascinating deep dive into ideas of passion and power dynamics, the struggles of identity and mental health, young womanhood, sexuality, and all the chaos of young life under late capitalism, Conversations With Friends is a monumental work for which I have nothing but awe.‘That sounds like a recipe for disastrous unhappiness, I said. You’re twenty-one, said Melissa. You should be disastrously unhappy.’In keeping with the title, this is a book that is certain to spark conversations with friends and I appreciate how this book tends to generate strong opinions on everything from Rooney’s storytelling to debates over which characters are most problematic. It has garnered strong reactions in the public sphere. On one hand it has been heaped with praise by many critics and celebrities alike (such as Emily Ratajkowski posting  her personal margin notes on twitter); on the other hand, Rooney has been decried as the harbinger of the death of the novel with Will Self calling her ‘simplistic’ with ’no literary ambition’. The latter tends to be an expected response when a literary novel has the audacity to be popular and profitable. This is often most pronounced when the author is a woman, such as the vitriol aimed at Zadie Smith just a decade ago or the excessive criticism lobbied at Donna Tartt when The Goldfinch won the Pulitzer Prize. I think part of the success of this book is its wide appeal, being nearly YA-adjacent in terms of accessibility and being centered on romantic affairs (without being a love story), though there is so much to say just beneath the surface and it is a book that is hard not talk about once you’ve read it. It also has a great story around it, with Rooney being contacted for a novel after the success of the short story Mr Salary (you can read it in full here) prompting a dramatic walk out of her restaurant job and finishing this in 3 months for a huge publisher bidding war to occur. ‘This could only interfere with my other ambitions, such as achieving enlightenment and being a fun girl.’There is a cliche that says debut novels are often based on an idealized expression of the author’s own biography, and while idealized seems to miss the mark here, something I enjoy about Rooney is how much she teases her own life into her fiction. This and Normal People are mostly set in the vicinity of Trinity College where the character’s attend as Rooney did (I spent a great deal of spring 2017 hanging out on this lovely campus, part of the reason why I wanted to read these books in the first place), and these college coming-of-age tales are set in a time period that coincide more or less with my own. Rooney excels at dialogue, this novel especially centered on ideas of communication as the title would suggest, and its part of what makes her stories feel so real. ‘Dialogue is the most fun to write,’ Rooney says interview with The Guardian, ‘it’s kind of like a tennis match. Do the first one and then ping, ping, it has to go back and forth.’ This is mentioned in the novel as well, with Frances finding the email exchanges with Nick to be thrilling ‘like a game of table tennis.’ It evokes a time right before the dominance of smartphones when so much communication occurred on a laptop over email, AIM or facebook messenger (back when only college students had access to facebook) and I too recall that being a primary medium of the awkward flirting between people who were most comfortable in written communication before finally having in-person communication. Rooney’s writing is rather blunt, avoidinging flowery or figurative language (as well as quotation marks, which I never notice until someone points it out as I earnestly view them as extraneous in adult literature when the writing carries enough context to know when a character is speaking) and many of the most powerful lines are delivered with a flat-affect that somehow makes them sting more while also capturing the cool-fronting personalities of the characters. These are intellectuals who assuiduisly present themselves as above it all. This is a book with lines like ‘no one who likes Yeats is capable of human intimacy,’ said unironically, which is—lets be real—exactly the type of shit you say in college when trying to be cool. These are character’s that say ‘ depression is a humane response to the conditions of late capitalism’ totally deadpan and make me go, okay yea, I know these people.‘You live through certain things before you understand them.’Rooney writes with a rather uninflected prose that captures the flippancy of young millennials to their own emotional state, like when Frances tells Nick ‘I just don’t have feelings concerning whether you fuck your wife or not. It’s not an emotive topic for me.’ Not that this is an emotionless book, with examples like ‘I hated them both, with the intensity of passionate love,’ showing an Annie Ernaux-like level of feeling everything deeply. These character’s just don’t like to show it. Also, despite being a very interior-life narrative through having Frances as the narrator, most of Frances is revealed from externally and we read of Frances’ physical reaction to an event or statement before we later, if ever, learn her emotional response. ‘At any time I felt I could do or say anything at all, and only afterward think: oh, so that’s the kind of person I am,’ which is sort of how Frances navigates this entire book, interpreting herself through how the world reflects her back. ‘I was a very autonomous and independent person with an inner life that nobody else had ever touched or perceived.’Frances’ identity formation being dependent on how others perceive her is a major crux of the novel, and the word mirror is used four times in the first chapter alone to capture how much Frances only seems to exist as a reflection in others . Having a frustrated relationship with her parents (not unlike in Normal People) , Frances has never really found a strong sense of self. Enter Bobbi, her former girlfriend and now best-friend/poetry performer partner. Bobbi is Frances’ primary mirror to herself at the start: ‘When Bobbi talked about me it felt like seeing myself in a mirror for the first time. I also looked in actual mirrors more.’ Bobbi who could ‘be abrasive and unrestrained in a way that made people uncomfortable,’ is good at telling Frances what she wants and taking charge, and Frances likes to give off the air of being very intelligent. She mostly performs this by speaking as little as possible outside of curt one-liners. She is in fact intelligent, but she also seems to only exist as a state of performance—like her and Bobbi’s poetry performances that get the attention of Melissa—and judges herself based on how others judge her performance. ‘The acclaim also felt like part of the performance itself, the best part, and the most pure expression of what I was trying to do, which was to make myself into this kind of person: someone worthy of praise, worthy of love.’This is an idea Rooney has grappled with in her own life as well. In an article on why she quit the debate team despite having been the top debater at the European Universities Debating Championships in 2013, Rooney says ‘ I didn’t cope very well with all the affirmation,’ and that ‘Victory only gives you new ways of perceiving yourself. Success doesn’t come from within; it’s given to you by other people, and other people can take it away.’ When your self-worth is contingent on others, your sense of identity is at the mercy of the world.‘I thought you liked my personality.Do you have one?’This is not unlike Nick, an actor, who Frances ‘was aware of the fact that he could pretend to be anyone he wanted to be, and I wondered if he also lacked a “real personality” the same way I did.’ Much of the attraction comes from the way they need to feel wanted by the other in order to feel anything about themselves, which the absence of him leads to a feeling of losing herself as well, saying ‘I had the sense that something in my life had ended, my image of myself as a whole or normal person maybe.’ But his attention, especially because it is the attention of what she assumes is a well-together man married to someone she admires, makes her feel special. ‘ It seemed as though what he was really saying was: there's something beautiful about the way you think and feel, or the way you experience the world is beautiful in some way.’ This leads to some inner tragedies frequently:’I was like an empty cup, which Nick has emptied out, and now I had to look at what has spilled out of me: all my delusional beliefs about my own value and pretensions to being a kind of person I wasn’t. When I was full of these things I couldn’t see them. Now that I was nothing, only an empty glass, I could see everything about myself.’However, this is a flawed and dangerous compass for determining self-worth. Jean-Paul Sartre explores this sort of bad-faith identity in No Exit where Estelle realizes that what another person reflects back might not be the same ‘you’ in your own mind.‘He was the first person I had met since Bobbi who made me enjoy conversation, in the same irrational and sensuous way I enjoyed coffee or loud music.’What Rooney does so effectively is have Frances sashay between loyalties to Nick and Bobbi based on her relationship with the other at any given moment due to her need to have her sense of self reflected back at her. Now I’m not usually a data-driven literary analysis person, but the website Plotting Plots is pretty cool to play with and does give insight into this aspect of the novel:

We can see Frances cycling between focusing her thoughts on the two, with Bobbi becoming a larger focus than Nick when having issues with him, and showing how much Frances groups the two characters together as essential parts of her life. ‘It was more that Nick’s sympathy seemed unconditional,’ Frances observes, ‘whereas Bobbi had strong principles that she applied to everyone, me included.’I do enjoy that there are no hang-ups over sexuality in this book—Frances is openly bisexual and never met with disapproval with even her own mother expressing disappointment when her and Bobbi break up—but there is still the lingering political issues around abortion in Ireland. Written when the Repeal the 8th movement was at its peak (Ireland would legalize abortion in 2018), Rooney notes the lag in women’s reproductive rights such as when, after a miscarriage, Frances notes she is at least glad she ‘didn’t need to consider things like Irish constitutional law,’ and the attempted shaming from the doctor who left the curtain open and ‘didn’t ask me if I was alright.’ Lingering hang-ups around sexuality due to obdurate Catholicism in Ireland filter through all three of Rooney’s novels, such as Connell’s aversion to BDSM in Normal People and the thematic plea against being judgemental in Beautiful World, Where Are You.‘Maybe he just likes to act passive so he doesn’t have to take the blame for anything.’Nick is an interesting character, one who is youthful looking enough to pass as much younger than he is, and uses past hurt to greenlight his own indiscretions. The novel approaches power-dynamics pretty head on (if one was wondering if Rooney see’s this relationship as inappropriate or not, look to Beautiful World, Where Are You), with Nick having anxiety about an affair with a young college girl and Frances trying to feel above power-dynamic stereotypes while still seeing herself as the victim who will eventually be tossed aside. ‘He has all the power and I have none,’ Frances thinks, ‘this wasn't exactly true, but that night it was clear to me for the first time how badly I'd underestimated my vulnerability.’ It’s hard to not question if Nick is exploiting her vulnerability, having a celebrity status and must certainly be aware of her mental health struggles, though it is also evident Nick doesn’t notice this and views himself, in his own depression, as a victim to Melissa just trying to find love. A few years ago Tavi Gevinson published an article on sexual power dynamics (here) using personal experience and the public discourse around Brittany Spears when she was still a teen to look at how men have weaponized ideas of sex positivity to create a false sense of power balance in order to exploit it. ‘ There is a difference between having power and feeling empowered,’ she writes, and Frances having minor celebrity status locally and the youth culture that opens the door for fun and frivolity in no way is actually balancing Nick. He respects her but Gevinson says ‘ If you can still be considered “mature for your age,” you are not an older person’s equal. This observation can easily go from an act of respect to license for harm,’ and she questions how power imbalance complicates ideas of consent. Akin to Frances thinking of their affair as empowering, Gevinson writes:’I now view some of my “empowering” experiences as violating, exploitative, and manipulative. I noticed that “gray” and “complicated” were words I used to stop questioning whatever had happened, rather than to understand it…and that, again, prioritizes men’s identities over their actions.’This is pertinent to the story here, especially as Nick is worried about his image so much (it is a bummer to learn the abuser in the Gevinson article is the dude from Vampire Weekend, sorry all). But all this is neither here nor there in the context of the novel, which doesn’t present issues for judgement but rather to watch them play out and think about the elements. The relationship web is very tangled here to aid that effect, and while it might seem easy to dismiss this as merely a book full of awful people, I’d argue they are just people as people are: flawed and fearful, bruising each other as they flail about at the whims of their desires. Besides, I like “unlikeable” characters and I think that’s half the point of literature: to understand the perspectives of others and learn empathy. This book nails it.‘Is it possible we could develop an alternative model of loving each other?’I will wave the banner for Conversations With Friends all day long. This is a complex story with a lot of emotional and interpersonal mechanics just beneath the surface, written with an exacting insight. These characters feel lifelike in their presentation, aided with Rooney’s mastery at dialogue through which the bulk of the book plays out, and they are people you feel like you know. Just some problematic friends who are here to have a conversation, and, as the length of this can attest, there is much to say and ponder long after finishing.5/5‘When you broke up with me I felt you beat me at a game we were playing together, and I wanted to come back and beat you. Now I think I just want to sleep with you, without metaphors.’"

13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24011233-bel-rodrigues,Rating 3 out of 5,"2,5 ⭐ok, vamos lá.o livro é literalmente sobre conversas entre amigos, por isso meu problema começa quando essas conversas sempre parecem extremamente forçadas, oriundas de uma banalidade e que acabam se tornando academicistas quase que o tempo todo. não consigo pensar em uma melhor amiga que vai ficar te dando aula sobre o capitalismo mesmo sabendo que você é declaradamente comunista há anos, por exemplo. é nítido que a autora sabe do que fala quando cita sistemas socioeconômicos e a disparidade de classes, mas ela evidencia tais assuntos onde eles simplesmente não cabem, ou seja, um simples rolê com seus amigos soa sempre como um convite à palestras maçantes sobre os problemas do capital (e suas consequências no mundo).isso poderia ter menos peso na minha conclusão caso o enredo me deixasse empolgada, mas também não aconteceu. o nick é um cara problemático que não sabe se relacionar com mulheres da sua idade e supre essa negação dizendo a si mesmo que é um grande aliado das causas realmente importantes para as mulheres. a autora é sutil e coloca em doses homeopáticas o fato dele procurar relacionamento com mulheres bem mais novas e acredito, nesse ponto, que tenha justamente um teor crítico (embora o final tenha me deixado quase crendo que ela só quis passar pano mesmo). não vou nem me aprofundar no fato das críticas ao capitalismo estarem presentes durante TODO TEMPO da história e em determinado momento a frances simplesmente decidir passar uma semana na frança viajando e sua chefe aceitar na maior naturalidade do mundo. é tudo tão circunstancial e conveniente que cheguei a achar que essa parte era sarcasmo (não era).enfim, concluí que se tivesse lido há uns 7 anos, teria gostado. a escrita da sally é excelente, assim como em ""pessoas normais"" — que é bem superior a esse —, na minha opinião."

I just knew I was going to love this book. It sounded like I was going to get a little bit of YA and NA combined into one brilliant masterpiece. Sadly, for me, that did not happen.I want to start with the first and deepest reason why I never connected with this book. It’s a big one, lovers.There are no quotation marks. It was extremely annoying reading a book when I couldn’t tell if a character is actually talking to someone or if there’s some inner dialogue going one. Half the time I didn’t know who was talking. Let me give you a quick example and you can decide for yourself.

Bobbi, I said. Does my face look shiny?Bobbi glanced back and scrunched up her eyes to inspect me.Yeah, a little bit, she said.I let the air out of my lungs quietly. There wasn’t anything I could do now anyway since I was on the stairs already. I wished I hadn’t asked.Not in a bad way, she said. You look cute, why?

It was the most distracting thing to deal with in the entire book. I can respect an author’s desire to be different or to try something new but this, no quotation thing was way too much for me. As an avid reader, I severely dislike loads of grammatical errors. A few here and there are not a problem but too many bothers the shit out of me. If I were the editor for this book I would have advised the author on the 100 different ways why, whatever that thing was, was a silly, silly, silly idea.I know that I often have many grammatical errors in my blog post, but I’m not a professional writer and my husband is my “editor”, so I don’t really care. If I were to write an actual book, trust me when I say that I would pay a great deal of money for a professional editor with a great reputation to edit the shit out of my book.Not once did I feel connected with the characters. It was like sitting through a movie when the actors were complete shit. The main character, Frances's, lack of self esteem and self loathing was too much. Everything about her was flat. I couldn’t care less about her life if I tried. Everything about the way her character was written was very stoic and mater-of-fact.Not once did I see an exclamation point. Every sentence ended in either with a period or question mark. There was no passion for the words. This went on for the entire book. I was so bored. Three hundred page of detached and impassive words.All in all, this book wasn’t for me and I wouldn’t recommend it for any of my reading friends, ever. I wish the author great success in the future.Oh, shit, I forgot to let you know if I liked the story. No, I did not. It was odd and unbelievable – that could have been down to the writing as well. If I wasn’t asked to read and review this book from the publisher, I would not have finished it."
15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73768036-lark-benobi,Rating 1 out of 5,The language is precise. The sentences have a staccato rhythm that I first found appealing but after a while they made me feel as if there were a ball peen hammer tapping on my head as I read along. The narrator is hyperactively self-aware and eventually I wanted to slap her. The stakes didn't seem particularly high. Many of the scenes seemed unnecessary. The book seemed unnecessary.

20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10490224-orsodimondo,Rating 4 out of 5,"GENTE NORMALEAlex Katz: Sharon and Vivien (in copertina).Conosco bene Frances, la protagonista e voce narrante di questo romanzo: ha difficoltà a esprimere le sue emozioni, e i suoi sentimenti, è così trattenuta che finisce col farsi del male (anche fisico). Appartiene al mio stesso club, però abbiamo preso la tessera in tempi diversi: lei, tenerella, è giovane giovane - perfino più di mio figlio - ha solo ventun’anni.Potevo piangere tranquilla perché nessuno poteva vedermi, e non l’avrei detto a nessuno.Per Frances mostrare ed esprimere le sue emozioni è un modo di “fare richieste” agli altri, agli amici, una forma di costrizione, e lei si rifiuta.Credo che sia per questo che spesso la gente la percepisce distante, perfino ostica, tagliente: perché Frances si scherma, si reprime, rimane in bilico più bloccata che slanciata.Lo pensa sia Melanie, che la fotografa e apprezza il suo talento letterario – Frances scrive poesie che poi recita insieme alla sua migliore amica, Bobbi, amica ed ex fidanzata: insieme si esibiscono nei locali, Bobbi è quella più recitante, Frances scrive e legge, insieme fanno “spoken poetry”.Lo pensa anche il marito di Melanie, Nick, trentaduenne attore di successo di rara bellezza e dolcezza, di cui Frances s’innamora, ma ha molta fatica a dirlo e dimostrarlo, vorrebbe tanto che fosse lui a dirlo e dimostrarlo. Hanno una storia, fanno l’amore insieme, molto bene, si baciano con intensità: ma Nick è sposato, proprio con Melanie, e pensa che Frances non sia particolarmente ‘presa’ da lui – lei è trattenuta, e pensa che Nick non sia particolarmente ‘preso’ da lei… Ma Frances non è né ostica né aggressiva, né distante né tagliente: ha un raro talento per la conversazione – non solo la prontezza di avere sempre la cosiddetta “risposta pronta”, ma di sapere andare oltre, di pronunciare parole intelligenti e ironiche, lasciando spesso il suo interlocutore un passo o due indietro. È quello che succede a Nick che perlopiù si limita ad annuire, ma nonostante i suoi abbondanti dieci anni in più, si sente poca cosa paragonato a Frances.Se qualcuno la definisce bisessuale (a un certo punto sarà coinvolta contemporaneamente sia in una relazione omo che etero, e a un certo punto il ménage è a quattro, non solo a tre), Frances risponde genialmente che si sente più che altro “onnivora”, così rifiutando ogni etichetta di genere. Sally RooneyIl talento verbale di Frances echeggia quello che la sua creatrice Sally Rooney sviluppò negli anni giovanili (non che ora non sia giovane, nonostante due magnifici romanzi all’attivo e la sceneggiatura della serie molto bella tratta dal suo secondo libro, Sally Rooney non ha ancora compiuto trent’anni) e che la portò a vincere premi internazionali nelle “gare di dibattito” (attività, o sport, o disciplina con la quale noi italici siamo ben poco pratici, e se non fosse per qualche film, probabilmente non ne conosceremmo neppure l’esistenza).Frances, Bobbi (altro magnifico personaggio), Nick, Melissa (& affettuosamente gli altri) chattano, si scambiano messaggi, hanno il cellulare in una mano, con l’altra digitano sulla tastiera del computer e perlustrano internet per cercare voli low cost, offerte di lavoro, info su malattie e terapie, si mandano mail (anche alla persona che vive nella stanza accanto, alla faccia della comunicazione diretta, vis à vis), usano (moderatamente) Facebook, guardano Netflix, s’inviano link (ma stranamente ascoltano più cd che mp3), vivono a Dublino e conosciamo bene il boom economico dell’Irlanda (mentre qui iniziava, o proseguiva, lo sboom), sono moderni, contemporanei, inseriti, al passo coi tempi, à la page.Ma i problemi che li avviluppano e coinvolgono sono piuttosto eterni: comunicazione, espressione, amicizia, amore, realizzazione…Si definisce questo romanzo, e la letteratura di Sally Rooney, come espressione della generazione “millennial”: anche se, a rigor di termini, Frances, che è nata nel 1996, credo si dovrebbe definire generazione Z. Ma son bischerate, lascio perdere.Tornando a Frances, legge “Middlemarch” alternandolo ai vangeli, ha sicuramente letto Jane Austen, scrive il suo primo racconto (che vende a una rivista per ottocento euro sistemando il conto in banca che era così rosso da rifiutarle prelievi) descrivendo così efficacemente la sua migliore amica e fidanzata che Bobbi reagisce traslocando e lasciandola.Frances è affetta da endometriosi, ha cicli mestruali che la portano perfino a svenire per il dolore, è autolesionista fino al punto da infierire sul suo corpo per infliggersi dolore fisico, che si aggiunge a quello della patologia: ma non direi che si autocommiseri, si pianga addosso, che tenti di giustificarsi e assolversi – piuttosto, si racconta e osserva, analitica e asettica. Ma sempre divertente ed emozionante.Debate competitionSally Rooney adotta una scrittura che mi verrebbe da definire elementare, che mi fa pensare alle tabelline, l’aritmetica più elementare.Una scelta che trovo funzionale al racconto.Anche perché accanto alla semplicità della lingua, regala a dosi generose acume di pensiero, osservazione, psicologia, racconto.Il tutto condito con un piacevolissimo velo di trattenuta ironia.Ho proprio goduto questo suo romanzo d’esordio, come mi è piaciuto il secondo. Un nome da seguire e non perdere di vista.Alex Katz: The Black Dress (1960)."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788446-hannah,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have spent the last days periodically exclaiming “God, what a book” (or more correctly, because I do speak German in my real life, “Gott, was ein Buch!” or “Dieses Buch!”). I am feeling vaguely guilty for having given other books five stars because this book is just so much more than most of those. I am in no way objective in my absolute adoration and I don’t think I can adequately articulate how very brilliant I thought this was, so stick with me while I squeal and talk in superlatives.I dragged my feet reading this book because the reviews are all over the place and it could have been so obnoxious (and some people think it is!): I mean, a book focussing on four fairly privileged young people making themselves miserable? A book where a thirty-something married man starts an affair with a 20-year-old college student? But this book hit me in all the right places. Rooney expertly weaves her tale, her characterization is sharp enough to cut, and her protagonist is a flawed piece of brilliance. Frances grounds this story in a way that worked exceedingly well for me and I found her, while infuriating, insanely relatable and incredibly true to life. Other reviewers have characterized her as unlikable – but I could not disagree more. She behaves stupidly, sure, but she is also lost and sad and sharply book smart while lacking emotional intelligence and I found her so very compelling. She is both the more active part of the relationship while also letting things just happen without taking action. She is incapable of communicating effectively while still being observant.Rooney also manages something incredible here: she made me feel for the thirty-year-old man sleeping with a much younger woman and lying to his wife. Nick could have been a walking cliché, but Rooney made him so much more well-rounded while never flinching away from the fact that he behaves atrociously. Every single one of the four main characters felt real in a way that fictional characters so rarely do, precisely because Rooney lets them be contradictory and, yes, sometimes unpleasant. But for me this unpleasantness never overshadowed the sympathy I felt for all of them.I cannot see this book not topping my best of the year list, which on the one hand is great, on the other hand it is only March and I have a whole lot Women’s Prize reading ahead of me. I will read everything Rooney had ever written or will ever write, starting with Normal People when it’ll arrive this weekend. On reread:Still a perfect book.You can find this review and other thoughts on books on my blog."
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair,Rating 2 out of 5,"I think this book might have worked better for me if I'd read it before Elif Batuman's The Idiot. Batuman and Rooney give their narrators similar voices: sharp, clear and deadpan but excessively self-aware. Both use email conversations to map out the development of a relationship. Both novels are told from the perspective of naive, supposedly intelligent young women who appear largely passive, falling into particular courses of action more because of the lack of a viable alternative than any great impetus on their part. When I say 'supposedly intelligent' here I'm really only referring to Rooney's Frances: she seems little more than a poser when juxtaposed with Batuman's protagonist Selin, who is imbued with such palpable intellectual power that her observations and ideas crackle off the page.The plot follows Frances and Bobbi, her best friend and ex-girlfriend, as they become entangled with an alluring older couple. Initially this is mainly because Bobbi is pursuing Melissa, an artist, but soon Frances enters into an affair with Nick, Melissa's actor husband. The whole story is told from Frances' point of view. This is a character-driven novel, and for me, the characters were the problem. On a personal level, I hated (most of) them; on a critical level I felt they lacked the necessary depth to make the plot work (in particular, I did not believe in Melissa and Nick as a thirtysomething married couple). When I think about it, Frances is true to a lot of what I remember about being 21 – her thoughts are self-absorbed, self-flagellating and gullible, her conversations filled with mildly endearing, very performative intellectual posturing – but for whatever reason, she made me roll my eyes with exasperation rather than feel nostalgic for that period of my own life.In contrast to the likes of The Idiot and Stephanie Danler's Sweetbitter, which offer fresh, provocative and delightful reinterpretations of the coming-of-age plot, Conversations with Friends is the sort of book that makes me think maybe I should stop reading fiction about people younger than me. Almost everyone in it is irredeemably narcissistic, pretentious and nowhere near as smart as they think they are. I wanted to slap Frances and punch Nick. The disproportionate ire aimed at stories about women who have affairs has long been a pet hate of mine, but in this case, I could find absolutely no sympathy for Frances and just felt irritated every time she got bogged down in her emotional distress over Nick. Unfortunately, this makes up an awful lot of the book.The narrative is always best when it moves away from Frances and Nick's relationship. An episode in which Frances is taken to hospital is lucidly realised, and in general Rooney's descriptions of sickness and pain are powerful. Bobbi is intriguing, though the tight focus on Frances doesn't quite allow enough room for the reader to see the charismatic figure other characters treat her as. (I'd have preferred the story – or at least part of it – to be told from Bobbi's perspective.) So yeah – I loved Rooney's writing here, she's so talented, and incredibly young to have written a novel so poised and polished. Despite the issues I had with Conversations with Friends, I'm really looking forward to reading more from her. I just hope she writes about less insufferable people next time.I received an advance review copy of Conversations with Friends from the publisher through NetGalley.TinyLetter | Linktree"
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 starsRight in the middle of reading Beautiful World, Where Are You last October, I ran to the bookstore to buy my copy of Rooney's debut novel, Conversations with Friends. I had no doubt I’d be reading her backlog, as well as waiting in line for whatever she publishes next. I had to mentally slap my own hand so I wouldn’t grab this one too soon. When a friend smugly flourished a newly purchased copy of this last month, a kindly tongue-lashing ensued on my part, followed by an embarrassing appeal to not be left behind. In hindsight, I’m not all that proud of myself, but this is Sally Rooney – and I’m completely infatuated with her at the moment! I was not disappointed in the least. What an impressive debut!“You live through certain things before you understand them. You can’t always take the analytical position.”Rooney’s characters don’t always have the luxury of age and experience on their side. I would venture to guess this is why some people don’t particularly fancy her stories. Readers sometimes find her characters unlikeable. They don’t care for their mistakes, their selfish behaviors, their navel-gazing or their obsessions. The reality, however, is that these people are true to life. If not wholly relatable, then in the very least they are entirely believable. They say and do things that make one squirm. They mislead, miscommunicate, and lie not only to one another but to themselves. They don’t necessarily do these things because they are evil people, but because they are finding their way, learning how to navigate this messy world. I never get the sense that Rooney is trying to tell us to love them or hate them. Just take a look at them and understand them. Do you perhaps see a part of yourself in them? Maybe you recognize your younger, less mature self there somewhere. Another thing they like to do is point out the flaws in one another. If they’re feeling particularly generous, they may indicate a strength in character. “When Bobbi talked about me if felt like seeing myself in a mirror for the first time.”The plot of this novel revolves around mainly four people: Bobbi and Frances, best friends and college students who once upon a time dated one another; and the decade-older, married couple Nick and Melissa. As you may suspect, they become entangled in one another’s lives. Though told from Frances’ perspective, we still observe all the various relationships amongst the four on some level. Through Frances, however, we learn the most; but then again, she’s not necessarily reliable. I always find this makes for an irresistible reading experience. I have to constantly remind myself that these are her thoughts, not those of some omniscient narrator or my own. She’s putting preconceived notions about everyone else into my head! I don’t know why I love this so much, but I do! One thing I found intriguing, and surely not a coincidence on Rooney’s part, was that she decided to place Nick in the career of an actor. Yet, he is not the only one playing a part in this novel. Everyone, in his or her own way, acts out a certain role. They don’t necessarily say what they are thinking, but instead say what they believe the others want to hear. Or they misinterpret cues and behave accordingly. They are not necessarily true to themselves or one another. I have to wonder if they even know how to be genuine. And still, I devoured this stuff!“I looked at Melissa and thought: I hate you. This idea just came from nowhere, like a joke or an exclamation. I didn’t even know if I really hated her, but the words felt and sounded right, like the lyrics to a song I had just remembered.”Gosh, I have so many thoughts in my head when I think of Rooney and her incredible writing. But you’re going to either love it or hate it, no matter what I have to say about it! She handles dialogue with great skill, and the torture of infatuation and relationships with such credibility that I could feel the discomfort and pain settle in the pit of my stomach at times. There’s infidelity, physical and mental illness, self-harm, self-loathing, and alcoholism. All are handled with Rooney’s deft touch. Never once did I think I was asked to judge these characters, and I think that’s what I love so much about her. We are all in the business of criticizing and passing conclusions on our fellow human beings aren’t we? Sometimes it’s refreshing to simply exist and to observe. “Everyone’s always going through something, aren’t they? That’s life, basically. It’s just more and more things to go through.”"

Granted this isn’t exactly a book a parent would ever recommend to their young adult- 20-ish old child - daughter or son...as this is not an educational book on inspiring relationships — But for me — as a 66 year old married fart who values honesty- with little-to-zero respect for adultery...( consented is up to the couple -‘lies’- destroy others)....Regardless.....I enjoyed the ‘conversations’.. the funny/ sensual scenes, and all the drama. I felt Rooney’s dialogue flowed so well -- it didn’t drive me into my head - my body simply absorbed the telling of this story. Some books are selfishly for ourselves - as this one turned out to be for me.I won’t even begin to try to intellectualize why I liked it... but I did! I’m won’t recommend it to most people..because for starters I don’t usually recommend books about messy ‘affairs’ ...But I gotta share — I laughed silly when I was in the hospital parking garage looking for a parking spot listening to a sex scene...when Frances ( the narrator) says to Nick the night of their first ‘cheating’ Rondevoo ( he’s married)........it was the first time she had sex with A MAN, too...Frances says to Nick:“Boy, I’m sure I liked that more than you did”....

“suffering wouldn’t make me special, and pretending not to suffer wouldn’t make me special.”

when i was fifteen, i was obsessed with finding these words in other languages with no direct english translation. i would read the meaning and wonder: why aren’t there actual english words for these meanings? because i know exactly what the feeling is or what the meaning is, but cannot describe it in one word.this is how conversations with friends makes me feel. all rooney books do, but this one in particular. frances and bobbi are best friends and exes. they meet melissa and nick, an older married couple. the book, while not a romance, is about the four of them and the relationships between them. at first glance, the premise is simple to a fault.but a closer examination shows the depth and nuances you wouldn’t be able to see with a skim. if you look past its superficial dermal layers, you’d see the book for what it is: a painfully realistic portrayal of human nature and the flaws it entails. rooney does this with meticulous detail that we would otherwise dismiss as pedestrian or ordinary, but manages to make it feel remarkable.in this book, sally rooney does what she does best: break down human relationships and interactions in a way where, when you’re done reading, you see things in a slightly different paradigm than you did when you first started.on that note, what really stuck with me was the power dynamic between nick and frances. frances and nick are both the passive / submissive ones in their respective relationships (frances with bobbi, nick with melissa).during their affair, frances often acts withdrawn even if her introspective thoughts indicate otherwise. meanwhile, nick is the opposite—he is almost assertive towards frances, but refuses to cross the line from a careless affair to a serious relationship. i think everyone has different interpretations of this relationship, as well as all the other ones, which makes for such a fun book to talk about.i hold this book so close to my heart and it gets better on each reread. i will probably inevitably reread this next year as well.⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻

one thing i feel like we don’t talk enough about in conversations with friends is the passivity in frances & nick’ relationship.frances and nick are both the passive / submissive ones in their respective relationships, which makes their relationship so complex and interesting, in my opinion. especially because they are passive in different ways.during their affair, frances often acts withdrawn even if her thoughts indicate otherwise. meanwhile, nick is the opposite-he is assertive towards frances, but refuses to cross the line from a careless affair to a serious relationship. (nick not leaving a relationship that has only been detrimental to him—melissa even tells frances she forgot that ‘anyone could love him’).thus, they are forced into a stalemate of sorts—bound by the constraints of nick’s current marriage and also by their reluctance to truly take any sort of real action or talk about what matters here. feelings, although they are very strong, are blanketed by their cold reality.there is also an interesting portrayal of power dynamics. frances is 21 and nick is 32, which tips the scales off balance, giving nick an automatic take-all in power because of his age. however, nick constantly tells frances he worries that she is not as infatuated with him as he is, and frances says on multiple occasions that it feels like she has the power.particularly, frances’ stance towards emotions is full of inertia and abnegation, as she distances herself from them. she treats feelings with clinical disregard, makes every subjective opinion in her head into one that is objective.the fact that sally rooney doesn’t use quotation marks also makes for an fascinating dichotomy because there are no traditional distinguishers between what stays inside her head as introspection and what she says. these are all examples of her passivity and reluctance to truly acknowledge her feelings and problems.there are two definitions of power in their relationship: one that is naturally exists due to societal conditions, and one that is just distinctive to them.⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻

27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26741582-john-mauro,Rating 1 out of 5,"Yikes. Why is this popular? This book concerns the romantic entanglements of flat, unlikable, privileged characters, who never overcome their self-absorption and shallowness. The shallowness of the characters and the uninteresting plot are coupled with a pretentious writing style, which makes this book all the more dreadful.To top it off, the reader is subjected to a large number of poorly written text messages and emails between characters. Dear authors: please don't do that.This book is, unfortunately, just a waste of time without any redeemable qualities, in my opinion."
28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7566229-rebecca,Rating 5 out of 5,"Frances and Bobbi are bestfriends and ex girlfriends. They've known each other for a long time and have been friends since high school. The two now perform spoken word poetry together as a side while studying in Dublin. When they are approached by Melissa, a journalist, they see themselves entering a world of success and wealth. Each is drawn to a spouse, Bobbi to Melissa and Frances to Melissa's husband, Nick. Gradually these bonds evolve and soon enough Frances feels things spiral out of control.There was something so therapeutic about reading this. Which is odd because it had a kind of depressing undertone. I felt seen and comforted by this story. Frances reminded me of my younger self so much. Which, if you met me now would be hard to believe! The writing is beautiful, it’s written in such a ‘matter-of-fact’ authentic way. I could feel myself absorbing every word. I loved it. I haven’t read Normal People but a work colleague persuaded me to watch the television series when it first aired and I loved it. There is no denying Sally Rooney is talented. I understand the hype now."
29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32804270-michael,Rating 4 out of 5,"Compelling and cool, Conversations with Friends places millennial malaise and an unexpected love affair against the backdrop of summertime Dublin. The fast-paced plot follows a pair of privileged college-aged performance poets and exes, Bobbi and Frances, as they become entangled with an older, slightly famous married couple, Nick and Melissa. The bulk of the story concerns the rise and fall of Nick and Frances's romance. The two flirt by messenger, bonding over their shared lack of direction, armchair socialism, and sharp wits; Frances soon has sex for the first time with Nick, the two vacation at a French beach house, and, inevitably, Melissa discovers and cooly responds to the affair. The fallout is messy and strange. Interestingly, the drama of the story is overshadowed by the novel's incisive dialogue. The conversations Frances has with Bobbi, Nick, and Melissa assume a variety of forms— furtive email messages, muted face-to-face interactions, rushed texts—and the characters muse about everything from love under late capitalism to the merits of anarchism. The rapid conversations, along with Rooney's exhilarating prose, make the novel move at a dizzying pace. Well worth reading."
30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29183570-katie-dorny,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is one of the worst books I’ve read recently.None of the characters were appealing, the dialogue and inner monologue of the main protagonist was so cold and self indulgent at the same it was sickening.I thought maybe they would explore some aspects of the lgbt culture since it dived into everything else on earth but NOPE it was just used as a political argument by one of the characters I really hated.Overall, this was crap. Gutted I wasted my time with it."
31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3263980-adam-dalva,Rating 4 out of 5,"Very, very strong, though I prefer the ping-ponging perspectives of the wonderful NORMAL PEOPLE. Rooney has such an uncanny knack for love squares and cliffhangers, and you'll fly through this, as I did. Her affectless prose is startling, though CWF has a few linguistic flourishes, especially toward the end, that slightly imbalance the text. She is a master of plot, of the importance of gestures, and desire. The one other thing about this book is that the lead repeatedly makes the same mistake in each of the 4 plot centers (health, father, ex-gf, potential bf) of the novel - she doesn't communicate. Though this is a consistent character trait, I found myself wishing for a bit more variety. I see why this debut brought Rooney attention - she's a star."
32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-dave-schaafsma,Rating 5 out of 5,"“You’re twenty-one, said Melissa. You should be disastrously unhappy.I’m working on it, I said.”Conversations Among Friends by Sally Rooney I listened to because of one of its topics, conversations, talk, and because I had just read and taught her second book, Normal People. I have to say I loved both books, where each of the central female characters in each book is very similar, physically quite a bit like what Rooney appears to look like. The two main characters share some deeply concerning personality characteristics that made me stop and want to text Rooney to see if she was not in fact sending us all a cry-for-help message in these books about her own self-destructive tendencies. I know, I know all about that author/narrator fallacy. Books of fiction may not necessarily reveal anything at all about the author, but it gave me pause, I tell you. In this one Frances—as does Marianne in Normal People—seems naïve, lost, ever losing herself, disappearing into herself, involved in self-damaging sexual behavior, at the same time making shallow precocious college girl feminist/anti-capitalist critiques of the very social swamps she swims in. We really do, I promise you, come to (pretty much) like these women, as we can see how vulnerable and lost they are. Young women, coming of age without a map, without a guide. You can read thousands of other reviews for better plot summaries, but the story here is that college student Frances, recently dumped by her girlfriend Bobbi but still her best friend, is not working and writing a little and involved in witty conversations with people she knows about feminism and very involved in various social media, performing at local spoken word events with Bobbi. Frances meets a (married) actor and has an affair with him, her first sex with a man. She’s 21, he's 32. Somewhere along the way Frances and Bobbi are invited to France by Nick and Melissa (his wife) for a summer vacation. Nick is a pretty successful actor, Melissa is a pretty successful photographer, Bobbi and Frances are college poets and they don’t seem to do much all day but text each other. So this is, among other things, a portrait of academic/class privilege, of young people not knowing what they are doing, damaging others, damaging each other, taking themselves altogether too seriously.Not convinced to read it yet? Hmm, let’s see. The people remind me a bit of Whit Stillman’s send-up of rich Manhattanites, Metropolitan, and a little bit of The Sun Also Rises, where all the people “behave badly” toward each other. I am troubled by all these folks, and yet engaged with them as characters. And I still love Frances, in part thanks to Rooney’s wonderful writing about this young woman learning how to develop actual friendships, learning how to have sex as a part of a relationship, things she knows almost nothing about, as witty and sleek and pretty as she is. It’s really quite a bit like Normal People, a coming-of-age story featuring two precocious girls living rent-free in space their parents provide for them, and talking smack about rich people while destroying a marriage in the process. Lost generation for the twenty-first century.Along the way Frances develops endometriosis and observes:“I realised my life would be full of mundane physical suffering, and that there was nothing special about it. Suffering wouldn’t make me special, and pretending not to suffer wouldn’t make me special. Talking about it, or even writing about it, would not transform the suffering into something useful. Nothing would.”Will Frances learn from her mistakes and find true love and friendship and become actually nice and usefully self-reflective? Well, let me tell you, I just loved the final scene, with Frances outside, freezing, talking to Nick on the phone, leading up to the last really surprising and confusing line that implicated me, at least, in the story, and revealed (to me) my being emotionally invested in the story, after all. I had heard (which made me not want to read it, a couple years ago) that Rooney had described her first novel, the first draft written of which was written when she was 15, as “absolute trash,"" and I thought she meant this book, but I found that she was referring to another, earlier, unpublished book. And this book is not trash' it is really, really good!! Two books by Sally Rooney in one year, and I am completely a fan, and I know, this review may not yet have really convinced you, because you fear Rooney must be as shallow as her characters!! You just think all these people are annoying and you want to shake them, and I get that. But I love her wry, understated, compassionate style so much."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6677659-marchpane,Rating 3 out of 5,"Conversations with Friends (the title and sunny cover are fairly misleading) is a stark, reflective novel which asks the reader to inhabit the mind of 21 year old poet and college student, Frances. She appears to be coolly detached from her feelings, at least in the beginning, and analytical to the point of neurosis.We get a sense of Frances' excruciating self-consciousness at the start of the novel, when she and her ex-girlfriend Bobbi are invited back to the home of Melissa, a ""slightly famous"" writer/photographer they've just met. In the taxi, Frances is ""ready for the challenge of visiting a stranger's home, already preparing compliments and certain facial expressions to make myself seem charming"". Upon arriving, she makes a point of deciding to ""remember everything about her home, so I could describe it to our other friends later and Bobbi could agree"". The novel follows her and her artsy circle from poetry readings to dinner parties to a holiday at a beach house in France. The plot, such as it is, mainly deals with sexual entanglements and jealousies within the group. These characters are disconnected, both emotionally and in the literal, digital sense. Tinder makes a brief appearance, and there's one mention of Facebook, but otherwise this book could almost be set at any time in the past 20 years. Communication is via email and instant messaging, and there's no sense of the hyper connected, social media-fuelled world we live in now. Presumably this was deliberate (the author is 25), but it just feels anachronistic and at odds with the book's realism. Frances' musings are alternately mundane, lambent, and pretentious, as befits a young person with more intelligence than experience. It's not clear whether she's become any wiser by the end, for all her introspection, but I guess that's not the point. It's more about exploring the nature of relationships and the power dynamics within them. This novel, like its characters, is pessimistic and aloof, as well as incisive and real. Unnerving, and occasionally scraping close to the bone, and you've got to respect writing that can achieve that."
34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80238438-ri,Rating 2 out of 5,"Just another book by Sally Rooney about highly intelligent characters who failed to have a normal conversation with their friends.My last book by Sally and I mainly read this book because I wanted to watch the adaptation of this book which has Joe Alwyn casted as Nick. But I don't think I have the energy to go through all the drama again. Honestly, this book drained all my energy and I dozed off so many times while listening to the audiobook of this book because it was so boring and the characters were immature and pathetic. Also there was cheating involved in this book and I hate that trope.The story is about Frances and Bobby and the unexpected connection they forged with a married couple—Nick and Melissa. Nick and Melissa's marriage was failing but they both refused to divorce each other and continued living their unhappy and miserable married life until Frances and Bobby appeared. I hated that all the characters in this book justified cheating on their partners as something normal. Like it's just an emotion and it's okay to feel it because Nick and Melissa weren't even in a happy marriage so what's wrong if Nick and Frances had an affair right? And it's definitely okay for Nick to sleep with Frances behind Melissa's back because Melissa cheated on Nick many times? Are you kidding me? They both were so keen on continuing their infidelity but refused to get a divorce because they loved each other so much to do it. All the characters were unlikeable, insufferable and pathetic. Sally described her characters as some highly intelligent people who can have intelligent conversations about capitalism, politics and economic disparities et cetera, et cetera. As much all those conversations were interesting and evoking, they all just left me feeling bored in the end. I didn't felt connected to the story, characters and their lives, their thoughts and ideas. This book is titled Conversation with friends yet they never actually talked about their true feelings with each other.Frances behaved like an immature child always lying to the people she loved. I can't get over how drab Frances is. She had no personality of herself and she was the main character of this book. She can't experess herself clearly so she just lies all the damn time. I get it you have issues but why can't she talk about them with someone? The decisions she makes cannot be justified by “she’s just non-expressive.” That’s not good enough to create an interesting, likable character. Bobby was infuriating. She is a stereotypical self-righteous-Im-too-modern-and-hip-for-monogamy-and-I-stare-at-paintings-all-day-but-im-too-emotionally-hollow-for-real-intimacy-type of gal. But atleast she tried to express herself unlike Frances.Nick was just Nick? Too passive and never standing up for himself. He had gone through some hard shit in his life and I get it how he must've felt. He wanted a divorce but Melissa told him she loved him so he just never asked her again. He says he loves Melissa and will always do, but then ends up cheating with Frances because as he said his wife cheated on him multiples times but he never did. So that justifies his infidelity? Melissa was irritating and unlikeable and I don't want to talk about her. She thinks too highly of herself but then feels inferior because some young and intelligent college gal had an affair with her husband and even got the book deal. Frances and Bobby call themselves friends but they don't have any chemistry. They simply just exist in each other’s lives, occasionally making conversation that lasts no more than an exchange of 10 words each. Nick and Melissa just needed someone who could you know who could just come and fix their relationship. They all had toxic relationships with one another. They just wasted each other's time and lives. None of these people are right for each other.I hated the ending so much. What's with Sally and open endings? Where was the character development?Sadly, this was a total waste of time and I don't think I want to watch the show now. In summary ""Very awkward girl meets an older attractive married guy and decides to fuck him.""—————————————————————————I'm still deciding whether to rate this book 2 stars or 3 stars 🥲 bcs its kind of 2.5 rn but lets see what happensRtc!!—————————————————————————My last book by Sally Rooney and hope it won't disappoint because there is a show based on this novel and i need to watch it after reading this book bcs Joe Alwyn is casted as one of the main characters 🤭 so here we go"

36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 Stars.Entanglements, my oh my!“Conversations with Friends” by Sally Rooney had me ALMOST from the get go. At first, admittedly, I wondered WHAT in HECK, I was listening too. Frances… rambling on about her goings on… her trysts with her school friend Bobbi.. which went from steamy to platonic very quickly. Frances’s description of her and Bobbi’s poetry readings and a woman named Melissa’s immediate intrigue in them and then BOOM. Somewhere along the way I began listening with interest, which then became curiosity and fascination. The moment Nick, Melissa’s husband appeared, I was completely hooked. Sally Rooney has a way of luring me in. Drawing me in, in a way where I can’t pull myself away. The relationships in this novel are extremely complicated. Though there should be a sense of right and wrong, somehow there isn’t. Looks exchanged.. feelings enmeshed, acts completed. There is no finality here. I read Sally Rooney’s “Normal People” before this and once again, I’m left feeling unsettled, wondering about the characters.  I will say that I smiled when the audiobook ended. I was happy with where it left off and yet, I was a bit on edge, thinking “no, don’t,” all the while thinking “yes please.”  Somehow Sally Rooney has this ability to leave me in a place where I am conflicted and I love it. “Conversations with Friends” is a character driven novel that immediately grabbed my attention and had me glued to the audiobook. The narration by Alice McMahon was stellar and I applaud Sally Rooney for her brilliantly written novel. I anxiously await what she comes up with next. Thank you to my local library for lending me this fabulous novel.Published on Goodreads on 1.25.19."

I don't mind unlikable characters, I don't have an issue with sexual fluidity or cheating (as in I don't need a trigger warning, it doesn't prevent me from reading a novel). In saying all that, the characters were insufferable, vacuous, bland, and the writing didn't agree with me at all.

39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49071166-hrissie-1st-week-on-campus-somewhat-run-down,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am absolutely s h a t t e r e d (in a good way too, if that makes sense? No no, I am not masochistic as far as I know, but Rooney does this to you.)(And I know I said that I would not go on to reading her other novels so very soon, but, well, here I am. How sweet to think that I even tried: it took one mere and fleeting moment of lostness, the feeling that I needed to read Rooney and that I could read nothing else, for my self-constructed stamina to simply slip away. And who am I, in any case, to Resist the Irresistible?)Right. Let us attempt to pick up some fragments and perhaps ‘look interesting’ in the process – something that extremely self-conscious Frances and her story companions would indeed have to plead guilty to. Because coming together, engaging in conversation with oneself and others, and thereby exposing oneself to one’s deepest vulnerabilities, in practice means just the one thing: messing up. Messing up to be what you think others would want you to be, what you feel you can or need to be, and ending up being the cold kind of ‘cool’ rather than the aimed for and appealing kind of ‘cool’. Is there no end to what a person would do to experience a very human sense of belonging? Indeed there is not. But what does belonging really mean? ‘What does it mean for a relationship to ‘work out’?’, as Nick asks Frances towards the end of the novel.The novel explores this as-old-as-time question with a depth that is preposterously astounding, and with candid and blazing insight into the contemporary world we live in. Frances and Bobbi, both fairly unconventional college students, go back a few years. It is clear from the start that they love each other profoundly. Bobbi is openly gay, while Frances is bi-sexual. And they perform together at spoken word or open mic events. Which is where they meet writer Melissa and her husband Nick, both in their thirties. From then on, between their personal and family traumas, their emotional upheavals, and their to-and-fro relationships with each other, these four characters are completely inseparable. They cannot stay away from each other. However much shame and resentment they mutually generate. This is particularly so when it comes to Frances and Nick. The closeness (and desire) they share connects them where everything else seems apt to divide them.The conventional dividedness between people – otherwise definable as monogamy – is the keystone-concept of this novel. What Rooney wants to do here is unpack the layers of inherited assumptions about exclusivity in human relationships – the contradictions and intricacies inherent in the idea and lived manifestation of love, and the tumultuous, self-shattering emotions that come along with it. On every powerful page, the narrative grapples with articulating – with trying, tirelessly, to understand – the human’s unceasing negotiation between conflicting modes of being and feeling. Whatever form their more literary-inclined ideologies takes, and we will agree that the stand taken by all four main characters – though to varying degrees – is relatively unconventional, the novel strives to probe the implications underlying our default responses to our-selves and others within relationships. Experience or lack thereof might not be the deciding factor after all: it is, rather, the complex coming to terms with what love really means or what it can mean, beyond capitalism as a form of life and multiple socio-political conditionings; beyond, even, one’s instinctive reaction, more often than not in tension with itself, its rational counterparts, and one’s actions. Of course, it is the nooks-and-crannies of Frances’s interiority that are wholly laid bare in this novel. Which makes it all the more impressive that Rooney succeeds in doing justice to all the other characters in the process. Not one of them is left behind; their dignity as flawed human beings lovingly safeguarded. Such that all of it feels so embedded in the composite reality of things. Rooney’s timing is excellent to say the least. Emails or phone calls or conversations happen precisely when the narrative finds itself hitting walls: needing to dig deeper, to retrace its steps, and confront excruciatingly uncomfortable ‘findings’. Frances, in particular, finds herself, unknowingly, caught in the murky midst of layers of delusions: ‘I was like an empty cup [...] and now I had to look at what had spilled out of me: all my delusional beliefs about my own value and my pretensions to be a kind of person I wasn't. While I was full of these things I couldn't see them. Now that I was nothing, only an empty glass, I could see everything about myself.’‘When there were four of us I always thought in terms of couples anyway […] But now I see that nothing consists of two people, or even three.’‘Is it possible we could develop an alternative model of loving each other?’ (this, she writes to Bobbi via email)(I confess that at one point I had the urge – which I acted upon – to flip through the pages in order to make sure that Nick and Frances would somehow get in touch again. You will feel the desperate need to know, trust me.)***My foray into Rooney-writing has been revolutionary in the personal and more literary sense of the term. Reading her is such an embarrassingly intimate experience, unparalleled – in her immensely and intensely humane treatment of human vulnerabilities – by what other writers have endeavoured to do with this seemingly simple thing called human relationships and individuality (nothing more complex, of course, as we know). The extent to which Rooney is able to allow writing to break and disintegrate, teeter so precariously on the edge of nothingness and destruction, is honestly mesmerising. I cannot quite believe myself, but I really have to rate Rooney 5 stars. Call it an endorsement of sorts. Or whatever else we want to call it. But: I feel too strongly about this! (Wise people indeed, at the Sunday Times, those who defined this debut as ‘addictive’.) One thing, in fact, is for sure: now I know for certain that Rooney is one of my (inexplicably and) immeasurably – too too much for my mind to contain – brilliant discoveries of 2022. This is H U G E.The question is: how long will it take for me to give in to reading her latest novel, Beautiful World, Where Are You? (asking where the beautiful world has got to is also a good question)."
40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76202320-henk,Rating 4 out of 5,"An uncomfortable read that sucks you into the sometimes bleak world of the narrator and shows what it's like to grow up in the modern day world... and I felt sorry for all of us, like we were just little children pretending to be adults.Our narratorBobbi told me she thought I didn’t have a ‘real personality’, but she said she meant it as a compliment. Mostly I agreed with her assessment. At any time I felt I could do or say anything at all, and only afterwards think: oh, so that’s the kind of person I am.Four people are followed in various states of relationships to each other by Sally Rooney. Frances is our narrator who together with Bobbi, her tough lesbian ex, does spoken word performances. Here she meets Nick, an actor, and Melissa, who together form a married creative couple (although I can hardly recall what Melissa does in day to day life).Frances is how someone could portray a stereotypical millennial: besides doing spoken word for a living, she calls herself a communist with the ambition not to earn more than the average income of the world (but is nonetheless quite impressed with Melissa and Nick their house), she is bisexual, seems to spend all her time at book launch events or at the college feminist society.She reads A Critique of Postcolonial Reason for fun at night and has quasi deep chats about being ""anti love, as such"".Despite this, Frances says overdramatic, almost teenager like things as: ""Have you ever said one sincere thing in your life?"" to her love interest. And she also has genuine self doubt, one thought of her is for instance: I looked like something that had dropped off a spoon too quickly, before it had time to set.I remember the late night conversations and chats I had as a teenager, and how everything that the other person said was picked apart by me for meanings in meanings. And how you’d talk and talk, but truly conveying what you wanted to say eluded you nonetheless. As in Normal People I think Sally Rooney pulls of making an unsympathetic, slightly morally gray character feel very real, very skillfully.At one point she twirls her hair in knots that break off, and that small detail made her feel very human and real, because I recognize that small habit from myself. And at a certain point we have Frances musing: I knew that intellectual attainment was morally neutral at best, but when bad things happened to me I made myself feel better by thinking about how smart I was.In general I could relate so well to Frances, even though she was annoying and immature at times, because she felt so much like a real human.ThemesConversations with Friends is filled with lot’s of communication per emails, msn, Timder and looking up love interests on Youtube and Netflix. At one point I just thought: ""Why do these people not just call each other instead of bickering on instant messenger"", and at times the conflicts feel a bit constructed. Besides the setting in the now (with references to Zelda games and the Arab spring) and some class struggle observations from the perspective of Frances, we have a lot of themes going on. Overall I found the book therefor not really a quick read; it packs a lot in slightly over 300 pages.We have the care for a drunk father who is on the path of self destruction, illustrated in a visceral scene with maggots in mayonnaise and flies everywhere. The fear of pregnancy and abortion in the context of the Irish law (that apparently only changed in 2018 in this respect) and later on living with something incurable pop up.There are some feelings of wanting to be sexually subjugated (hello Normal People).We have some light (if that is a good term for it) automutilation and some heavy feels of psychological instability and people who have full fledged psychiatric depressions.To put it mildly, Conversation with Friends does not feel very uplifting despite the colourful cover, and becomes a bit too top heavy and constructed by too many heavy themes at some points. This also makes it a rich book, certainly when realizing this is a debut of a twentysomething writer.RelationshipsIn the core, all of the characters have troubles with vulnerability. There is an overarching fear of living life alone, and not being the number one to anyone, even their parents. It almost reminded me in this respect to the feeling Norwegian Wood gave me.I think the best scene that illustrates the overall focus on the exterior, and the lack of true engagement with the interior, was when Bobbi said to Frances, who asks for help, that she doesn't have time for her because she wants to watch a documentary on human rights abuses in Algeria.Building on the above, everyone in Conversations with Friends has problems and seems lonely, talks down on themself and wants to be a nicer person (If I was the person i wanted to be  is a thought that comes back a few times). And again, if these people just talked to each other, there would not be much of a plot at all, and quite a lot more happy people. Perhaps anachronistically in our modern world, the extramarital affair of Nick and Frances made me feel slightly uncomfortable, partly due to the age difference and the awkwardness of Frances interacting with his wife during the affair. Nick overall is just called handsome all the time, in a bit too much tell kind of manner, but gains some depth through the book when we zoom into his medical history. Not much emotion is outspoken, but overall I found him a decent person, despite being a bit overly passive. In the end I kind of got their relationship:I loved when he was available to me like this, when our relationship was like a Word document which we were writing and editing together, or a long private joke which nobody else could understand.The other good friend of Frances, Bobbi, comes less to the forefront. As a reader you observe her more based on her behavior than on explicit statements from herself. I had a tough time understanding what the appeal of Bobbi was, besides her confidence? She rarely seems to spare a thought for another person and occasionally came across as really unkind. We do have a touching scene of the both of them being young and kicked out of the Tesco because they read out aloud embarrassing passages from the Men’s health. But I felt her as a character and love interest to Frances much less.ConclusionThe quality of Normal People, Rooney's second book, is that all the mundane, the wine drinking, socialising, diners and smoking, are skipped due to the structure of the novel, only focussing on pivotal moments. In Conversations with Friends this is not the case: for instance, I thought the whole excursion to France part took forever.Before part two of the book I felt this would end at a between two and three star book. Fortunately the pace picked up, and I want to quote two phrases at the end of the book that tie in neatly with why I think Conversations with Friends is a solid four star book overall:Gradually the waiting began feel less like waiting and more like this was simply what life was: the distracting tasks undertaken while the thing you are waiting for continues not to happen.You live through certain things before you understand them. You can’t always take the analytical position."
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/125539776-tj,Rating 1 out of 5,"usually sally rooney books make me feel like shit in a good way but this one just made me feel like shit period. i think the difference is typically while her characters go through highs and lows, grow together and apart and hurt each other along the way there is still a thread connecting them and making it clear they are each others 'people'. they have a special connection that cannot be replicated that keeps them coming back to each other and that's what makes all the pain beautiful and bittersweet and worth it. i did not feel that with this book. it played around a lot w the concept of open relationships and polyamory but the characters were so repressed emotionally, so in denial about their true desires and so set on being above normal human emotion that i had hard time finding the beauty in it all.but the email from his wife??? absolutely iconic luv. let me include the best part just so i can come back to read it when i wanna cackle
“I’m putting this in an email because I don’t trust Nick to be straight with you about it. He has a weak personality & compulsively tells people what they want to hear. In short if you’re sleeping with my husband because you secretly believe that one day he will be your husband, then you’re making a serious mistake. He’s not going to divorce me & if he did he would never marry you. Equally if you’re sleeping with him because you believe his affection proves you to be a good person, or even a smart or attractive person, you should know that Nick is not primarily attracted to good-looking or morally worthy people. He likes partners who take complete responsibility for all his decisions, that’s all. You will not be able to draw a sustainable sense of self-respect from this relationship you’re in. I’m sure you find his total acquiescence charming now, but over the course of a marriage it actually becomes exhausting. Fighting with him is impossible because he’s pathologically submissive, & you can’t scream at him without hating yourself.”
i'm sorry but after i got that email i'd have to talk myself into ever wanting to fuck him again. miss girl decimates him and then goes on to contemplate if she actually does want to murder him and says that she knows if he found out that she maybe wanted to kill him he's so submissive that he wouldn't even object 🤣🤣🤣 pls i-
“I’ve become so used to seeing him as pathetic & even contemptible that I forgot anybody else could love him.”
she came for this mans throat i was screamingggg 😭😭 everyone always says sally rooney's characters are pretentious and unlikeable and even though that's true, i've always still liked reading about them since they are so flawed and human. sometimes that was true in this book, but most of the time i was truly rooting for their downfall. whenever nick was vague or emotionally cold to frances, whenever she couldn't perceive his emotions for her and it was hurting her i'd be villainously rubbing my hands together cause bitch this turmoil is what you DESERVE. i wanted her to get nOTHING and honestly she did 😌💅🏽 and when she'd be cutting and cold to nick i'd be smiling so wide cause he's weak so he'd just let her 😌😌ultimately tho this was a confirmation that my mental health is not built for affairs cause bro i could never. i must be type A cause how does someone enter into a relationship w no end goal? he's married, what could possibly come out of this besides anxiety idgi. i think i would feel differently if the affair was casual, or the relationship dynamics were healthier and everyones needs were being met but that was simply not the case here. the fact that the book ends and frances still hasn't come to terms w the fact that she'll never be fully satisfied with him loving someone else? girl what were we here for then. at the very least she should've accepted that she craves love and affection that makes her feel a bit miserable and that's okay"

There was an audible gasp when I said that based on two books alone, Sally Rooney is now one of my most favourite authors. She is just THAT impressive to me. Her grasp on human nature is phenomenal, the way she takes what can be seen as relatively “normal” relationships and picks them apart and lays them bare continues to astound me. Her characters are so real and relatable, and her stories are the equivalent of peering in through windows into other people’s lives. Basically I could write an essay on why I love Sally Rooney so much.Conversations With Friends follows Frances and the numerous relationships she has in her life. There’s her best friend, and former girlfriend, Bobbi. And then there’s the married couple that they become close friends with, Melissa and Nick. What follows is a complex love rectangle(?) comprising all 4 characters.Rooney’s novels are character-driven, and her characters are really where she excels. They are not always likeable, often making poor decisions, but they are 100% authentic. Frances is fascinating - she is intent on coming off as cold and emotionless, when she is anything but. All her feelings are repressed, as she is afraid to show her vulnerability and would rather travel down the path towards self-destruction.As expected there are a lot of conversations between friends, as they share their observations and theories on many topics. Rooney’s dialogue flows freely, even if it does make me wonder why I don’t have such intellectual conversations with my own friends.Endometriosis is also discussed in this one, which I appreciated because it hasn’t featured in any books I’ve read and it’s a chronic illness that requires more awareness. Sometimes as women we think we just gotta battle through these agonising periods, but if it gets THIS bad, please ask your doctor about it.Overall, LOVED IT, but Normal People remains my favourite. Now the wait begins for another Rooney novel. 4.5 stars."

She's empty and cold. By the time she demonstrates a sliver of emotional intelligence, we're the dumb ones for sticking around longer than deserved.I love unlikable characters. I thrive on their stories. Usually, they possess a je nais se quoi begging us to join them on their journey. However, all I thought about was Frances' end to her journey. I did not care, which is sad. There is a health issue involved and I found myself shrugging, never sure if I'm manipulated into forced sympathy. Good writing, which, at times, comes off as printed cinema verite. I can see a one-shot camera following Frances and her batch of smug and wealthy vagabonds, unimportant to the common person, waxing poetic about sex, adultery, wine, and travel over scenic pastures in black and white cinematic fashion. I give this story a plus on painting a strong picture as I read scenes.Another plus? It's set in Ireland. I like reading international stories with their cultural nuances, slang, and other sights on what makes us normal (or abnormal) as we live life. LGBT representation serves as its final plus. Frances's bisexual. Her friend and sometime hook-up, Bobbi's a lesbian, along with Melissa, another character entrenched in a strange menage a trois-like situation with Frances. I had no idea. But, I'm grateful for the representation, even if the women involved caused my eyes to sweat, due to excessive eye-rolling.Yet, I desired more than literal conversations with Irish and LGBT friends. I yearned for a plot with a path (low path indeed) with characters earning my following. The good writing and LGBT representation saved my review from hailing a one-star verdict. I cannot recommend this story. It's boring. Verdict: 2 out of 5*Thanks to Penguin First Reads for the ARC in exchange for an honest review*(Courtesy of http://www.craftyscribbles.com)"

De hecho, los personajes y situaciones son prácticamente iguales, así que si ya leíste uno no te pierdes nada pasando del otro. Pero mi baja calificación no es por eso, porque cada autor es libre de hacer con sus personajes lo que quiera, incluso reciclarlos, el problema aquí es la inmadurez con la que fueron tratados algunos temas, como la salud mental y las relaciones dañinas. Aunque como lectora estoy acostumbrada a ver malas representaciones de trastornos mentales (usualmente es algo que solo está allí para que el personaje X encuentre la salvación en el personaje Y), aquí me ha chocado más porque tenía altas expectativas respecto a este libro luego de haber leído Gente Normal y haberlo disfrutado como lo hice en su momento, pero ya me cansó la historia de «por amor me he curado» y es peor en una novela dirigida a adultos. Da hasta vergüenza ajena.Sobre los personajes no tengo mucho que decir porque, en realidad, no me gustaron pese a su parecido con Marianne y Connell. Nick es codependiente a más no poder tanto de Melissa como de Frances y Frances no parece saber lo que quiere nunca (al menos Nick tenía claro que las quería a ambas y que no quería dejar a ninguna). Nótese que solo he hablado de ellos dos, porque pese a que la sinopsis hace creer que está es una historia de cuatro, en realidad los únicos protagonistas son Nick y Frances. Por último, y lo más insoportable, es que el 70 % del libro es relleno. La protagonista describe todo con lujo de detalle, durante páginas, metiendo pensamientos disque filosóficos para dárselas de intelectual y aburriéndome a más no poder. Entiendo que la autora quisiera escribir algo que invitara a reflexionar sobre los aspectos del paso a la vida adulta y el autodescubrimiento a través de las relaciones que aceptamos continuar, pero he leído mejores libros con las mismas intenciones.En resumen, no ha sido mi mejor lectura, pero puede ser que si hubiera escogido otra orden para leer tanto este como Gente Normal, las cosas habrían sido diferente.

48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74034800-lucy,Rating 4 out of 5,"Third re- read of this book in preparation for the series! Really enjoyed it- I like the analysis of characters and the introspectiveness.Original review:4.5****Things and people moved around me, taking positions in obscure hierarchies, participating in systems I didn’t know about and never would. A complex network of objects and concepts. You live through certain things before you understand them. You can’t always take the analytical position.I adored my reread of this book and within the last 100 pages I felt almost grief while witnessing Frances’ consciousness. This book offered up truth and insight into the female consciousness and dissected thought so thoroughly of what it feels like to be young and female, making questionable choices and decisions, as well as reactions to things that are happening outside of your control. This book was intellectual while also exploring friendship, love, jealousy and power play. I enjoyed how Sally Rooney writes these real and flawed characters, with their multitude of feelings.Sally Rooney shows how all things can come to a collision, the realness of feeling sad all the time and how uncertain and out of control everything can feel, especially in the new modern setting. She shows how young females often hate themselves and feel insignificant with the pressure and unsureness of this world. Sally Rooney includes relevant important and modern topics such as Endometriosis and (at the time this was written) the VERY restrictive abortion rights that Ireland had at the time and what this could mean for a female. It also focused on dysfunctional parental, parent-child and partner relationships, monogamy and polygamy and how this effected the MC, and more importantly how the MC responded to all of this uncertainty and suffering.I especially love how Sally Rooney describes and often portrays cool-headed, smart and observant women with flaws, intellect and wit.Was I kind to others? It was hard to nail down an answer. I worried that if I did turn out to have a personality, it would be one of the unkind ones."

Never be best friends with your ex2. Never be in a relationship with a married personThere's nothing good coming out of any of either of these.Frustrating adult characters. Frustrating behaviour of every character involved from page one till the last page.However, I read the book because I just wanted to read it.Her writing and her characters. They are so real to me.The family issues. The relationship issues. The stereotypes. It's the kind of book when you read it, it's talking about your most innermost thoughts and insecurities.I don't know about anyone else. But her writing and Murakami's writing bring comfort to me making me turn towards them and tell them ""you just seem to know what I actually felt"".Trigger warnings for alcoholism and domestic abuse/violence.I really dislike the typical toxic behaviour of the parents and the partners in the story.Things do get worse when you are with toxic people all your life and you do not know how to move on.It's not easy but then for those whose worse fear is being alone, whose parents still nag and sting, whose friends include someone as convenience and the only relationship they have is doomed from the very beginning. It's too late to rescue them. But then who says it is?I feel the title is a way of telling how you cannot converse about what you actually feel with your so-called friends."

You live through certain things before you understand them. You can't always take the analytical position.”“Come and get me, then.”i watched one (1) interview, of about 34 minutes long, of sally rooney's writer thoughts and the next day i had to get all three of her most talked novels, conversations with friends being one of the three.i do not know how else to put it coherently other than giving this book the paper crown of me knowing that it would be one of my favorite books even before i was 20 pages into reading it.i have always, sub consciously, and now with consciousness too, enjoyed and fancies when ever people or words seemed to adorn and dote on the mundane details of things and just. . life. sally rooney's writing and her descriptive paragraphs and plots revolving around the day to day activities, finding beauty and bizarreness in them, that is undoubtedly one of my favorite things about this book and her author.after what feels like a good few years of mine, i felt my love and sheer curiosity with words and how just the stringent of these 26 alphabets placed differently every time could make me feel things, came back to me, with conversation with friends. “Everyone’s always going through something, aren’t they? That’s life, basically. It’s just more and more things to go through.”Frances, Bobbi, Nick and Melissa were characters i loved and loathed for all that they were. Each, along with a few other characters, felt very humanely written: with thoughts that i could relate and even be frightened of relating to, at times safe, and understood at others. The fact that somewhere, somewhere in Dublin, their still busy living their lives and just that i do not have the exposure of reading about it can may be convey how much their story, or part of what we get, means to me. This was my first sally rooney novel and i may declare with confidence for it to be one of my favorites by her.“Is it possible we could develop an alternative model of loving each other?”It's 12:24 am right now and it's a slow drizzle out side my window and i doubt the words i've spewed in this review would do much, if any, justice to the feelings i hold after finishing this novel, but if not, i'm perfectly content to an extent, using it as my diary log, posting the aftermath of having finished a piece of art.if you're still reading, i do hope you pick this book. love it or hate it, it comes with a plethora of words that'll make it hard for one to keep emotions at an arm's distance.needless to say, but, i loved it. and i look forward to reading more of sally rooney's works:)"
52,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128938274-sophie,Rating 5 out of 5,"A lot of times I kind of like to do research on the authors of the books I read, just to help me understand their writing at a deeper level. I'm also very into astrology and sometimes I like to be like, ""ooooh ok, this author is a Scorpio sun, I can see that reflected in their writing."" or even in the broader sense, ""oooh, this person struggled with a chronic illness that was mentioned in their book, that makes sense.""I was doing a little bit of research on Sally Rooney, and one of those little frequently asked question thingies with the little tab that drops down popped up for me. The FAQ was, ""why do people like Sally Rooney so much?"" I clicked on it, revealing an article from  The Medium  that said, ""Her books read and feel different from the usual contemporary fiction selection. They talk about the significant issues of our times, but not in a ranty overbearing way.""I saw this and immediately started dramatically snapping my fingers and nodding my head in agreement in a rather dramatic fashion because Sally Rooney's writing is  so unique  and relevant, but yet, somehow not in an ""iM nOt LikE oTHeR giRLs"" way. I adore her writing style and I was equally happy with this novel as I was with her other pieces of work.  Conversations With Friends  centers a young poet named Frances, and her affair with an older actor named Nick, who is married to this woman doing a literary piece on Frances and her friend/co-worker/ex-girlfriend, Bobbi. This is definitely one of Sally Rooney's books that has a slightly more morally ambiguous main character, I found myself going back and forth between loving and hating her. I felt that Frances was selfish and arrogant at times, but also that she was that way because of how she was raised, feeling like that's the way she needed to be in order to survive and maintain control over her life. This would make an  excellent  book club book in my opinion because there's tons of room for debate in that department. Maybe you think that I'm biased (I am, everyone is), but Sally Rooney's novels always strike a chord with me as someone who's also experienced a lot of abuse and often doesn't consider themselves a good person. I like that her characters are complicated and not just very black and white good-guy-bad-guys, it makes them seem more human and relatable, especially when it comes to depicting the ugly & complicated lifelong effects of trauma and mental health issues, and the relationship between the two.I suppose you could argue that some of her characters are co-dependant and have sort of a subconscious damsel-in-distress thing going on, but I truly believe that a lot of the ways in which we heal and learn more about ourselves are through our relationships with other people, be it romantic, platonic, or otherwise. In that sense, I like that she often uses this lens of relationships to observe a lot of the issues she talks about in her books. Overall, very intelligent and thought-provoking writing, I'm actually kind of sad that I've now read most of Rooney's novels, but I'm hoping she'll come out with something again soon in the next little bit <3"
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani,Rating 4 out of 5,"Conversations with Friends, Sally Rooney Frances is twenty-one years old, cool-headed, and darkly observant. A college student and aspiring writer, she devotes herself to a life of the mind--and to the beautiful and endlessly self-possessed Bobbi, her best friend and comrade-in-arms. Lovers at school, the two young women now perform spoken-word poetry together in Dublin, where a journalist named Melissa spots their potential. Drawn into Melissa's orbit, Frances is reluctantly impressed by the older woman's sophisticated home and tall, handsome husband. Private property, Frances believes, is a cultural evil--and Nick, a bored actor who never quite lived up to his potential, looks like patriarchy made flesh. But however amusing their flirtation seems at first, it gives way to a strange intimacy neither of them expect. As Frances tries to keep her life in check, her relationships increasingly resist her control: with Nick, with her difficult and unhappy father, and finally even with Bobbi. Desperate to reconcile herself to the desires and vulnerabilities of her body, Frances's intellectual certainties begin to yield to something new: a painful and disorienting way of living from moment to moment.عنوانهای ثبت شده در ایران: «زمزمه‌های دوستانه»؛ «نجواهای دوستانه»؛ نویسنده: سالی رونی؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش عنوان: زمزمه‌های دوستانه ؛ نویسنده: سالی رونی؛ مترجم آمنه محمدی؛ ویراستار محسن فلاح‌نژاد؛ تهران، نفیر، 1399؛ در320ص؛ شابک9786226344357؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایرلند - سده 21معنوان: نجواهای دوستانه؛ نویسنده: سالی رونی؛ مترجم آمنه محمدی؛ ویراستار محسن فلاح‌نژادمجرد؛ تهران: فانوس دنیا‏‫، 1399؛ در 402ص؛ شابک9786227407327؛برگردان عنوان اصلی کتاب «گفتگو با دوستان» یا «صحبت با دوستان» است، زمزمه و نجوا واژه های دیگر در زبان انگلیسی دارند؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 22/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

How it was doomed to end unhappily.He nodded, looking at me. I did, he said, I just thought it would be worth it.Conversations with Friends is a really good book, and a great debut novel. Frances, Bobbi, Melissa, and Nick are fully realized characters, and every page shines with Ms. Rooney’s immense writing talent.I do wish I had read it before I read  Normal People. Both books explore similar grounds: young people navigating love and relationships, hamstrung by pride, envy, jealousy, secrets, and perhaps most of all, failures of communication. But with four main characters in (at least) three relationships, this book has a more diffuse focus, and is ultimately less intense than Normal People. Highly recommended, and definitely worth reading, but I’d recommend reading this book before you read Normal People."

I don't have to relate to characters at all, I love unlikeable characters, but I have to be interested in what is happening, and I wasn't. I had to force myself to pick this book up. I kept thinking, something will happen, something will make this worthwhile. The writing itself is passable, but that's it. That the story, or lack thereof, supposedly reflects the boring mundaneness of their lives, is a cop-out, and a bizarre excuse to give this novel credence. Clearly, lots love it, and I'm obviously an outlier here, but I read a hell of a lot, and although I try never to be harsh in reviews, I'm just gobsmacked by how poor this novel is and all the love and awards it has received."

Ive seen a lot of reviews saying nothing happens in this book but the writing style is what gets you to stay, but honestly the writing almost made me chuck the book out of the window. Its all just : we did this , then that. then we went here, then i got this then that happened then i left and got sad then we did that. then i went home. feels like reading a diary. and if youre lucky sally might just throw in one or five hundred similies. god once u realize that the only prose sally rooney writes is using similies, seeing the word ""like"" becomes maddening. there are over 300 similies in this book, yes i checked. and 90% of them arent even good. examples :When Bobbi talked about me it felt like seeing myself in a mirror for the first time I was cold like a fish. The charachters make no sense and just made me want to rip the pages of this book. Frances is white, bi and a communist. And watch as she shoves it down your throat for the 300 pages. every thing that happens to her she'll go , no one understands me cause im a communist and biand the author wants to prove this and she will make everyone around her talk about something dumb in politics and frances will shy away from the convo because shes a communist and watch the author emphasize that. and the one line that made me want to murder someone : I sometimes felt drawn to disclaiming my ethnicity, as if, though I was obviously white, I wasn’t ‘really’ white, like other white peoplewhite people and their dumb white people problems. they will look for any way to be opressed. there was also a part where all the main charachters, all white, just watched police brutality videos out of no where ?? whatand once they all talked about the war against syria during (or i think after) a party?? a country is dying and theyre treating it like a gameshow conversation That night we talked about the war in Syria, and the invasion of Iraq. Andrew said Bobbi didn’t understand history and she just blamed everything on the West. Everyone at the table made an ‘ooh’ noise like we were all on a game show together. oh yeah and  We end up asking like, is Israel ‘nicer’ than Palestine. You know what I’m saying. NO I DONT KNOW WHAT YOURE SAYINGso what did we learn from this? never buy two books by the same author because youre so sure youre gonna fall in love with them because all you will be left with is a shitty book and an unread one that will sit on your shelf forever. oh yeah is it just me or does the title make no sense? ""normal people"" the title of sally rooneys other novel is revolved around a conversation.this book called ""conversations with friends"" is mostly a romance with the friends arguing all the time and the term normal people is mentioned more than 10 times. idk very randomEDIT : forgot to mention, this book is what i imagine the walking dead to be like if there were no zombies"
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69445513-solanne,Rating 5 out of 5,"It’s funny — before I’d so much as picked up one of her novels, I held this preconceived notion that Sally Rooney wasn’t going to be for me. After reading one too many scornful reviews, her name dredged to mind stiff, pretentious characters, a tedious writing style, and faux-deep passages. So, when I picked up Conversations With Friends, I was entirely committed to hating it. But the truth is that, despite myself, it consumed me, utterly and irrevocably.I began this in the abominably early hours of the morning, bleary eyed and ill-rested. However, as the morning light crept in, my defenses began to unravel, leaving me bare and vulnerable to Rooney’s tale. By the time I’d turned the last page, I found myself surrounded by empty coffee mugs, sun high in the sky, blinking as though emerging from a trance.I could list all the reasons this book should have left me indignant — be it the irritating lack of quotation marks, the characters’ astounding ability to be simultaneously self-pitying and self-righteous, the complete lack of plot, or the pretentiousness sparsity of it all, there are more than enough reasons to hate Conversations With Friends.Yet none of that seemed to matter. And to be entirely honest, I think I’m still trying to understand myself why this book managed to lure me in so completely. Maybe it was Rooney’s sharp, eviscerating prose, or her skillful ability to weave complex characters (even if they are pretty unlikeable at times). Maybe it’s the manner in which she manages to exude self-awareness without seeming preachy or condescending. Or perhaps it’s simply that early winter darkness puts me in a weird headspace. Who knows? I suppose that ultimately, my message boils down to this: I loved this book. And while I may not know the why of it all, it doesn’t really matter. Because it touched me regardless.> 5 stars "

There were pages where my emotions were overwhelming and I could feel my eyes watering even though there was nothing there that resembled my own life in the slightest. I find affairs with married men an uninteresting subject; high-flying literary couples with holiday homes in the South of France a complete bore; cool young women who find it hard to communicate their feeings and wishes a mystery. Yet, the characters of this book, especially Frances, the narrator, Bobbi, her best friend, and Nick, the depressive actor, got under my skin and stayed there long after I had finished the book.People who have read Normal People will recognise some themes which inform Rooney's writing: difficulty communicating one's feelings and frequent breakdowns (both literal and metaphorical); characters so lacking in self-confidence that they constantly feel the need to hide underneath a veneer of 'coolness'; masochism; relationships that do not work because the characters cannot own up to their feelings. And yet, at the end, a small progression as if to confirm that growth is possible, albeit with great difficulty and without taking it for granted.As always, Rooney's strong point is how minutely she dissects the inner world of her characters. Their motives, feelings and above all those insecturities that threaten to tear apart their whole world. Damaged people who have spent time in psychiatric wards; people who self-harm; and yet, at the end, a glimmer of hope. Healing is possible, says the book, but do not take it for granted; don't expect a 'happily ever after'. But do expect a mature (far more mature than the auhtor's 27 years) exploration of how people actually move from A to B, where A is a world of self-harm and self-doubt and B is a decision not to let everything go to pieces but instead hold on to friendship, love and companionship."

61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117254654-flo,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am officially a Sally Rooney completionist. ""Conversations with Friends"" is actually her first novel, making me think she only re-wrote the same story after it. The book is, as the title suggests, about conversations with friends. The catch is that some of those conversations end under the sheets. This isn't because every relationship starts as a friendship, but more because the characters are complicated people (or so they say - they are college students / artists, so of course, they believe that). They are only ""friends"" because they don't agree with the ownership that comes with words like ""girlfriend"" or because some are even married. It would be easy to label the characters and their ""conversations"" as toxic. Some of their thoughts are genuinely disturbing. ""I considered asking him to stop, but the idea that he might ignore me felt more serious than the situation needed to be.""But doing that would remove all the curiosity. A book doesn't need to provide answers; it only has to make the reader ask questions. That's why Sally Rooney has become one of my favorite writers – she knows how to play with the unconscious expectations of the modern reader. When Frances, our narrator, starts a relationship with a married man, we can't help but categorize that as ""bad."" And if she is a horrible person, he is even worse, no? However, when the characters act like ""It feels strange... hearing myself talk... like I was the main character"", it's hard to place blame on one person for a long time. That's great because when you observe so many contradictory actions, there is room for something that feels more like a real story. Because this review is getting too long, I'm going to say that Sally Rooney has managed to capture a moment in time about online conversations/relationships. It's unfortunate that we are moving more towards video interactions because there was something more creative in writing messages/emails. ""That night I decided to start reading over my old instant message conversations with Bobbi... It comforted me to know that my friendship with Bobbi wasn't confined to memory alone and that textual evidence of her past fondness for me would survive her actual fondness if necessary... It was important to me that Bobbi would never be able to deny that at one point she liked me very much."" One last mention: the first time I liked the ending of a Sally Rooney novel."

I'm going to edit my review.This book is unconventional, attractive with an interesting plot and beautiful conversation. Dialogue, truly, is Rooney's expertise. Francis and Bobbi, lovers and friends. Nick and Melissa, a married couple. The two somehow tangle in an unexpected mess. The result, an affair between Francis and Nick. These two likable characters embark on an unlikable liaison, yet you are rooting for them--I know, I don't get it either. The layers of this complicated and tragic story hold space in the heart of the reader.This is Rooney's first book. I'm hooked. Her second book, Normal People, was just as amazing. There is something relaxing, textured and relatable in Rooney's style of writing. It is crisp, clean, and gets to the point.Her characters, severely flawed, falling in love with them is the only way to endure and stay hopeful for a redemption. The constant movement of thought and intelligent writing moved the story along in a way that was very satisfying, even though the story is one of infidelity.   ""You live through certain things before you understand them. You can’t always take the analytical position.”I loved this book! 5/5 stars."

“Gradually the waiting began to feel less like waiting and more like this was simply what life was: the distracting tasks undertaken while the thing you are waiting for continues not to happen.” 

To be honest there are some books that I just go into blindly without even reading the synopsis for all kinds of reasons. Sometimes it is a beautiful cover, sometimes a recommendation from a friend and in this case it was the hype this author was was getting and the fact that she has written it while she was 27 which is just 2 years older than me and I find that aspiring!So it is hard for me to describe the plot of the book because if I wanna over simplify things, it is a story about Frances and her Ex girl friend Bobbie, both gets pulled into the world of journalist Melissa and her friend Nick. Frances who is bisexual falls for the husband and Bobbie kind of falls for the wife.The writing is actually good, I think if it was not well written, I would not have had the ability to finish it but for a debut by a young author, the prose is polished. There was something weird going on with not using quotation marks and the story is told exclusively by Frances POV in first person narration. There were sometimes when the characters would go into philosophical discussions and use complicated words that did not add much into the story and I just read the author is a Marxist and a debater and I think there was some self insertion going on there.

“Everyone’s always going through something, aren’t they? That’s life, basically. It’s just more and more things to go through.” 

Another reason that got me excited to read this but after getting the book was that it takes place in Dublin. I got excited for the Irish settings but unfortunately, I did not feel that it did take place there, it could have taken any place in the world because the settings were very generic and my excitement was pretty much short-lived!Now the characters were unlikable and they made me uncomfortable and I thought the author wanted to do that intentionally. As mentioned above, we are stuck in Frances head throughout the book and she is kind of insufferable. I kind of related to her being cold in general because I myself was described as such by some people. But I just have less feelings about things than most people do and it is something that I am used to now and it was exciting to see that kind of represented in a book. But the dynamics in the books were kind of tiring in their repetitiveness, the characters do something stupid and then they regret it and then apologize and then overthink things and the cycle is repeated. The word “Sorry” is repeated 94 times in the book, I actually appreciate people who can apologize because it is not a common thing these days. My problem was that the apology felt superficial and not much growth followed that apology which made it kind of lame. Also I thought that Frances attraction to Nick was mostly for his hot looks, I can’t deny that he is a more complex character than that but the romance was very fast at first. I saw some people mention the word “Polyamory” but I can’t see the relationship as that, there was no consent from all partners and it was more of an affair!And speaking of affairs -which the characters describe their relationship as- I could not decide if it was being romanticized and I still can’t shake that feeling that it was. I thought that the ending would decide how I felt on this an I won’t spoil the ending but I did not like the way how things ended. Also a few random things that came into mind were that smoking is mentioned a lot to sound edgy, the self harm thing was not well discussed and some of the threads were left loose. Also why were people using emails when it was clearly mentioned they have social media and messaging apps?!!?!

“I think I only appear smart by staying quiet as often as possible.” 

Summary: I think my enjoyment of this book stems mostly of the technical parts like the language and the way it was written to still grip the readers with unlikable characters. However, the characters, settings and plot were not satisfactory in my opinion and I think on the long term, the book will fade in my memory and I will mostly remember the negative parts which makes me settle for a final generous rating of 3.5 stars!"

A i zato što onda čitaoci pristupe romanu očekujući da potvrdi njihove predrasude o datoj generaciji.Naravno da od toga nema ništa. Ono što dobijemo je, naprotiv, vrlo oštro i precizno napisana psihološka studija jedne rane etape sazrevanja. Oštro je ključna reč: Sali Runi nema mnogo milosti prema svojim likovima ali se uzdržava od eksplicitnih morališućih iskaza i od čitalaca očekuje solidno pažljivo čitanje.Iskreno, mene je ovde najviše iznenadilo koliko se profil studenata književnosti ne razlikuje ako uporedimo Beograd recimo negde '97-98. i Dablin cirka 2012-14. Najveća razlika svodi se na to da sada za očajničke poteze postoji Tinder a pre dvadeset godina je očajna osoba morala da se iscima i ode na žurku da bi našla nekog za jednokratnu upotrebu. Sva ostala očekivanja da ću otkriti kako su to milenijalci korenito drugačiji od nas matoraca pala su u vodu jer sam se od starta identifikovala s pripovedačicom a ne sa starijim parom koji ona upoznaje (još u blurbu! Neće ovde biti spojlera!) a doduše, solidno sam starija i od tog starijeg para pa mogu da pretendujem na totalnu uzrasnu objektivnost.Razgovori s prijateljima stvarno perfektno hvataju taj užasni trenutak mladosti kad siroto čeljade proizvoljnog pola, roda i orijentacije počne da otkriva da postupci i izbori koje donosi nekad imaju neočekivane a trajne posledice, kao i to da očigledna intelektualna nadmoć ne može da zameni manjak životnog iskustva. I vrlo precizno portretišu fluidne i nejasne međuljudske odnose u kojima se (recimo) nečije očajanje i zjapeća praznina popunjavaju tuđom nesigurnošću i kompleksom manje vrednosti ili se voljenoj osobi pridaje fantazmagorično savršenstvo a pritom se beži od jasnih definicija ili, daleko bilo, trajnih odluka – u tom pogledu, najdraža mi je izjava negde pred kraj romana kad neko savršeno samouvereno kaže otprilike „ne, ja nisam u vezi s tobom, ma otkud“ osobi s kojom živi, spava, jede i priča o filmovima. Svaka čast na samopouzdanju, ali to nije performativni iskaz :DJoš dve opaske i gotovo. Prva: primećujem da se veliki broj čitalaca zgražava kako su likovi ogavni ljudi koje oni ne mogu da podnesu. Na to mogu da primetim a) kako im očigledno nije pao šaka ni grimdark ni Lobo Antuneš pa čak ni neka epizoda Igre prestola i b) da žive u nekom mnogo ružičastijem svetu od mene jer su glavni likovi najnormalnije, najobičnije studentkinje, glumci i spisateljice/fotografkinje koje možete zamisliti, ne izdvajaju se nikakvim naročitim zlom nego su sasvim umereno nesnađeni, nesigurni, sebični, često nesrećni i često vredni ljubavi (ali ko u to da ih ubeđuje). Druga: među iznenađenjima koja, kad razmislim, i nisu toliko iznenađujuća bilo je i otkriće da će žena koja dođe u bolnicu sa užasnim bolovima i krvarenjem imati bolji tretman u skrnavom srpskom zdravstvu nego u irskom zdravstvenom sistemu jer će NA PRIMER kod nas lekari uraditi ultrazvuk odmah a u Irskoj će ga komotno zakazati tamo za tri meseca a dotle ko živ ko mrtav jer ginekologija u katoličkoj zemlji. I utoliko je pominjanje Savite Halapanavar, provučeno onako u pola reda i bez imena kao vest na radiju, još jedan oštar i precizan detalj koji zahteva pažljivo čitanje."
68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1880531-caro-bookaria,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book revolves around two college students in Dublin named Frances and Bobbi and their relationship with Melissa & Nick who are a married couple they meet early in the story. It is told from the point of view of Frances which at times can be described as very matter-of-factly and at other times as very introspective. A lot of the interactions happened by email which I thought was a bit strange since nowadays most people communicate by text. I mean, there were some texts but a large part of the interactions happened by email. I think that two of the main themes of this book are loneliness and the need to connect to other people. The main character attended literary events often and was generally noticing the artsy stuff around her, for example, at one time she noted a ""Toulouse-Lautrec poster"" at her home, art items like this were mentioned often. Overall I had a hard time connecting to the main character. Although things happened throughout, I do not feel that Frances grew or accomplished something after the events in the book. I enjoy reading about self-centered, unlikeable characters but they have to be interesting which was not the case for me.  
Thanks to NetGalley, the publisher, and the author for an ARC of this novel in exchange for an honest review.

71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2441461-colleen-scidmore,Rating 4 out of 5,"My youngest son, who I’m very close with lives all the way in New York..I am on the opposite coast in California. We have seen each other several times when he’s come home for visits (totaling 3 weeks) since he left home almost 2 years ago. We talk frequently on the phone but it’s not the same as being able to spend time with the person you love. So in order to keep a close relationship we have started buddy reading just very recently. That is actually pretty tough for us though because he has much different, and honestly more intellectual taste in books than I do..lol. I get bored by his choices and he thinks I read dumbed down literature..lol. But thankfully we found a book that was on both of our reading lists, which is Conversation With Friends. Frances and Bobbi best friends, ex lovers and college students are performing their poetry reading when they meet Melissa for the first time. Melissa is an older (late 30’s) well known journalist/photographer that’s decided her next piece will be about Bobbi and Frances after viewing their show. After a night of drinking and getting to know one another she invites them into her home. Frances immediately feels begrudgingly impressed by her beautiful and expensive home because wealth is against her beliefs. Frances’s views are very socialist and she believes people should own what they need and nothing more. She is awe of Melissa’s talent but a bit disgusted by her opulent life style. And the fact that of course on top of that she would have a drop dead gorgeous actor for a husband, even if he is B List. As Frances and Bobbi begin a weird sort of friendship with the pair Frances is increasingly drawn to Nick, Melissa’s husband. The two start a strange flirtation that spins out of control and the course of everything in Frances’s life changes. Her relationships with friends, parents, Nick and eventually Bobbi. Even her body betrays Frances as she suffers a series of medical episodes. Her life shifts so much in such a short time Frances is not sure how to pull herself out of this downward spiral that she has created. If you are looking for a fast pace book this is not it. There really isn’t a whole lot going on except days of Frances life. It’s pretty much what you’d expect from a book titled Conversation With Friends. Her feelings, her thoughts and her actions. But it’s so well written that it’s not boring at all! Miss Rooney brings depth to her characters and I couldn’t help but be immersed in Frances’s life. Because the characters are what make up the story I’m going to give my thoughts on the main four.Frances is the kind of girl that everyone likes but she has no real friends, well that is until she meets Bobbi. She really irked me a lot of the time, she made some really dumb decisions that I couldn’t understand. I wanted to thump her on the forehead and ask her WTF was wrong with her! She is supposed to be a talented intelligent person, in fact she is THE talent behind the friends Written Word Shows, but man does she make some horrible decisions! Also she’s supposed to be a Super Socialist or something to that effect, when she obviously was coveting Melissa’s life Bobbi was a weird character to me. She is the more attractive of the two, she’s even considered beautiful, but her brash personality is off-putting to most people. She is the performer in their poetry readings and doesn’t contribute otherwise. She obviously loves Frances (as a friend at this point) but she also loves to get under her skin. And she did some weird mean shit to Frances which I don’t think any “friend” would do, but then she’d be so concerned and really there for her. She was pretty confusingNick was a wimpy douche to me. I liked him at times and when I really got to see the person underneath the skin I appreciated some of his actions. Nick has dealt with some mental health issues, which his wife probably helped along. But he still was a bit of a douche to me all around.Melissa felt cold to me. I had to put myself in her shoes sometimes to stop disliking her so much. But she was the person I liked least and I kind of felt some of the events that affected her she actually deserved. 🙈Overall this was actually a very interesting read, even though nothing seems to be happening exactly, with fleshed out (and a bit strange) characters. I was fully invested in the outcome of their lives. Sally Rooney has proven with her debut novel that she is a talented author with many more stories to offer."
72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59050228-meike,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is dangerously addictive and strangely fascinating, and the true riddle at its core is how Sally Rooney achieves these effects with a text that mainly consists of dialogue, with very sparse atmospheric descriptions, and with a story that is certainly not fast-paced or original. Rather, the focus is on introspection and the attempt to connect to other people in various ways, and Rooney manages to render the situations she describes unsettlingly relatable - what might be a mundane story arc for a literary character is an existential experience for the individual depicted, and Rooney makes the reader feel for her protagonist while at the same time capturing our current cultural moment. Our main character and narrator is Frances, a student at Trinity College (which Rooney herself attended) who has a working class background and enjoys performing spoken word poetry with her friend (and ex-girlfriend) Bobbi. At such an event, they meet Melissa, a journalist, and later her husband Nick, and they befriend the couple who is about ten years their senior. What comes next is to be expected: Frances has an affair with Nick, a depressed actor in crisis, and frankly, not much more happens, but Rooney does a fantastic job depicting Frances' feelings and decisions in the light of current discussions and themes in the context of feminism, moral values, and love. We also get numerous scenes describing Frances' experiences as the kid of divorced working class parents who as a student - struggling to make ends meet - is thrown into a world populated by people with different backgrounds and thus attitudes. It is a real pleasure listening to Rooney's language, which, while not lyrical or exuberant, is witty, smart and precise - this is a book with lots of dialogue written by a former European debating champion. There is something cool and sometimes even pleasantly deadpan about the delivery of the whole book, which tends to stand in vibrating juxtaposition to borderline pretentious statements uttered by some characters, many of them over-edcuated (if there even is such a thing), but limited when it comes to their emotional repertoire. Then again, we all have limits when it comes to our emotional expertise, the differentiating question is mainly where those limits lie, in this book just as in real life. A pretty great book, and I found it fascinating to scroll through other reviews to find out how different readers reacted to Rooney's characters and their trials and tribulations - this book certainly evokes some strong reactions. I guess I have to read Normal People now. (I listened to the German audiobook; Zoë Beck's translation flows wonderfully and Dagmar Bittner does a great job reading the text.)"
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30800-oriana,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was incredible. It took me a beat to get into it -- the absolute matter-of-factness of the writing style, the perpetually present pacing, the lack of quotation marks in speech, the full thrust into the middle of the lives of these characters without throat-clearing or scene-setting -- but once I was over that hump, I was hooked, in just the most frantic, voyeuristic way. The word I keep returning to is bracing, like the whole thing was a cold brisk wind that I had to lean hard into to stay upright.Look, here is the story of four people, a married man and woman in their thirties and a pair of female college students, and the various ways they couple and decouple, from platonic to erotic, from distrust to lust, from jealousy to adulation, &c &c. It's not about much; they go from bars to dinner parties to the South of France to a Dublin campus, talking intensely of everything from anthropological monogamy to pay-gap feminism to the perpetuation of privilege. They all have various fucked-up family members they have to contend with, various emotional unravelings, various dreams unrealized and lives imagined but as yet unlived. But they are all such full, real characters, whose intricacies and messes keep unfolding and revealing themselves to new degrees of devastation. Each of them hurting themselves by acting in very believable ways, where you can achingly see why they'll do it, and see how it's going to wreck them, and see how they probably know just exactly how much it will but yet they can't not do it and this is why life can be so bleak. But also interspersed with such explosive little moments of happiness! Of joy, of sex, of thrill, of the unexpected delight of the person you care about saying just the right thing in just the most shockingly right way. Of the reveal like a yanked curtain, when a new revelation about someone tilts the whole frame and suddenly so much that was murky becomes clear. And her language, my god. Just these sharp agonizing little turns of phrase in a style that seems so lullingly simplistic, I felt myself actually gasp when I came upon them. ""We were driving along by the harbor, where the ships implied themselves as concepts behind the fog."" ""The roses had huge, sensuous petals and tight, unrevealing centers, like some kind of sexual nightmare."" ""The room was dim, evocatively dim, as if it contained a hidden pool of water somewhere."" Who even thinks of these things?Anyway, good christ. What a sharp angry hard beautiful gem of a book."

I even began searching my emails and texts for “evidence” of our affairThat night I decided to start reading over my old instant message conversations with Bobbi …. It comforted me to know that my friendship with Bobbi wasn’t confined to memory alone, and that textual evidence of her past fondness for me would survive her actual fondness if necessaryOur [Frances and Nick’s] relationship was like a word document which we were writing and editing together
Sally Rooney is a 26 year old debut novelist – with a back story which included being the number one competitive debater in Europe.https://thedublinreview.com/article/e...This is her first novel. Frances (the 21 year old first person narrator) and Bobbi were lovers when 17 having met at high school, and, as (Trinity College Dublin) University students still remain very close friends, performing spoken word poetry together (with the more reserved Frances as writer and the provocative and more charismatic Bobbi as the lead performer). At an event a literary website writer Melissa (married to a moderately well-known and strikingly good looking actor Nick) approaches them and proposes she writes (and illustrates with photos) a profile of them. The group of four start to meet frequently together – Melissa and Bobbi immediately strike a bond of mutual fascination, while somewhat relegated to the background Nick and Melissa end up chatting, which quickly move through flirtation, online and phone sexually charged conversations, a seemingly one-off sexual encounter, and then a full flown affair (which starts when the two students join the married couple, and some of their friends, on vacation at a large house in France). The affair is complicated by the other strands of the “ménage à quatre“ – Frances and Bobbi’s past and current bonds, Bobbi and Melissa’s mutual fascination, Melissa and Nick’s marriage (with Melissa as the dominant character and Nick a passive player). It is played out not just through sex, but through conversations, phone calls, computer messaging, text and emails – an important aspect of the book and of Frances’s view on relationships (as the quotes above imply). At times the technology can seem slightly age-inappropriate (Email and text seem to be the preferred communication media. Tinder and Facebook make only brief appearances, Snapchat/Instagram/selfies not at all).The affair also takes place against a background of Frances struggling with: a condition which she keeps hidden as far as she can, particularly form Nick, but turns out to be endometriosis; with a drunk and absent father for whom she has lost all feelings (albeit she is very happy to take his support payments) set alongside pressure from her separate mother to stay in contact with him; and with Frances’s (clichéd but no less valid) worry about what commitment Nick as a married man, unprepared to leave his wife has to their relationship. She sporadically indulges in low level self-harm, and even tries to engage (fairly superficially it has to be said) with Jesus and his gospel message. We see little of Frances’s poetry – which at one stage she describes as just writing and pressing the enter key frequently – or a Bobbi-inspired short story she writes (after she forgets to press the enter key for a long time).All this makes Frances while not a completely sympathetic character at least a partly deep one – as perhaps the biggest issue with this book is the superficiality of the other characters and their privileged, directionless lives.Of debating Rooney commented “you need to have a taste for ritualized, abstract interpersonal aggression” – and “you must be clear in your attempts to get the better of the teams arguing the opposite side of the question, but subtle in undermining the other team that’s arguing your side. It’s against the rules to contradict them openly. Instead, you need to emphasize at every opportunity that your arguments are the more important.” and she clearly transfers some of that approach to Bobbi. Whether this is meant to make Bobbi an interesting character I was unsure – she is described as charismatic – but I found her arguments immature with constant references to the overarching flaws in capitalism or patriarchal systems. A final observation on this book – neither praise nor criticism – is that, in my view very unusually for an Irish literary book, the Irish setting of this book has almost no impact, in fact it could easily have been set in London or East Coast US. Overall certainly an interesting debut by a young author writing with a fresh new voice about a young character experiencing a very old story (a woman having an affair with an older married man)."
78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2120450-julie-ehlers,Rating 4 out of 5,"On a vacation to Portland, Maine, a few weeks ago, I visited two independent bookstores that both had the newly released paperback of Conversations with Friends featured in their displays of bookseller recommendations. Although up to then I'd been unsure if I'd read this novel, I decided to heed the two endorsements and bought a copy at one of the stores. Perhaps this experience predisposed me to like the book, but like it I definitely did.I won't rehash the plot here but will just say that Conversations with Friends is about two college-age friends (and former lovers), Frances (the narrator) and Bobbi, who befriend and become entangled with a thirtysomething married couple, Melissa and Nick. I thought the way Rooney developed these characters was extraordinary. She performed that elusive stunt wherein we see everyone through the narrator's eyes, but learn enough about all the characters to form our own opinions of them--including of Frances herself, who is definitely no objective observer. Some of the insights into character this novel imparts were a bit close for comfort, as when a character claims she doesn't have a ""real personality"" and only gets clues to what kind of person she is in retrospect, or when a character remarks that Frances sees herself as powerless and therefore doesn't really believe she can hurt people the way other people can hurt her. Both of these sentiments would have described me when I was college-age, and I wish I'd had someone (or this book!) to make me aware of them at the time. I know a lot of reviews have called these characters unlikable, but I didn't really find them unlikable, and I also don't think it was Rooney's intention for us to like them, which makes all the difference.Beyond that, the book just pulled me in. Conversations with Friends is a perfect title, because although plenty happens in this novel, it really did just feel like spending time with Frances and the other characters in her orbit. As in life, even dramatic events don't necessarily result in a ton of drama; everyone absorbs what happens and attempts to fumble through in their own way. The result was something with a quiet but undeniable emotional impact.I mostly liked the writing style, although I suppose it was occasionally a bit self-conscious. The last scene, with Frances wandering around Dublin talking on the phone, getting colder and colder, leading up to the last (surprising!) line, left me seriously impressed and anxious to read something else by Rooney. Like most novels, Conversations with Friends isn't for everyone, but it was certainly for me. I agree with the booksellers of Portland: This was excellent."
79,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17568354-eliza,Rating 4 out of 5,"Thought provoking and honest, Conversations with Friends is a book nearly without flaws. I say nearly because Normal People by Sally Rooney is much stronger in terms of it's plot, and this book feels like the rough draft to her newest novel. That said, Rooney's style is unique and original, and I love how honestly flawed all of her characters are. And this story is a perfect representation of life: it's messy and unpredictable, and we are all just trying to find our footing."

81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127645342-emma,Rating 5 out of 5,"there is something so fascinating about humanity, about the mundane, about what makes us tick, vulnerabilities and all. conversations with friends only confirms this. in this character study, sally rooney centres her interest in twenty-one-year-old student and aspiring writer frances and her ex-girlfriend/best friend bobbi who, when performing spoken word, meet melissa, a well-known journalist, and her husband nick, an actor. soon they enter a world above their own, finding themselves in homes they could only dream of, attending dinner parties they once laughed at and holidaying in brittany with little money to spare on frances' part. when this newfound closeness leads to unexpected developments between frances and nick, the former is forced to confront her own vulnerabilities and ignorance for the first time as the complexities of what it means to be human are exemplified through the quartet amongst the walls put up and the facades hidden behind. the general notion about this novel is that it is about four people you would not want to know in real life. they make bad decisions, are cruel, manipulate, and overall are the worst humanity has to offer. i think this is false. i would want to know them. in fact, i probably do. i could even be one of them. for all of its reputable generalisations, this book is not about an affair. instead, it is about connection - the connection of ex-lovers, of best friends, of the love that remains, and of a married couple. you will not root for one pairing over the other or even one character over the other, for these are four beings who battle with the notion that they do not want to be known - by us, by rooney herself, by each other. there will be times when you hate all four, there will be times when you love all four for their vulnerabilities are at the surface of each of them, despite any outward confidence bobbi and melissa may possess. as it is always there, it is frances who, unsurprisingly, is the most fascinating. perhaps due to an alcoholic father with abusive tendencies and an enabling mother, her inability to be vulnerable unless it is to harm herself alongside her failure to accept weakness creates a self-deprecating woman battling with the idea that she is nothing and that those around her are special. her desire to be loved despite her adamance that those around her do not create a character to become enraptured with as she comes to the slow realisation that she is known and cared for by those around her. admittedly, the prose made my heart clench. so raw but full of the tenderness needed when involving broken people who want what we all want: to be loved. but to be loved is to be known and how do the characters you become fond of accept this when parts of themselves remain hidden? how do we? outstanding. “things and people moved around me, taking positions in obscure hierarchies, participating in systems i didn't know about and never would. a complex network of objects and concepts. you live through certain things before you understand them. you can't always take the analytical position.”"
82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,Rating 3 out of 5,"Frances is bisexual and used to be in a relationship with her bestie, Bobbi. The two perform spoken word poetry in Dublin and their literary circle enters the orbit of Melissa, a thirtysomething writer, and her actor husband Nick. As the group become friendly, Frances starts an affair with Nick. Drama inevitably ensues! Sally Rooney’s Normal People blew my hair back but unfortunately I can’t say the same for her debut novel, Conversations with Friends. Not that it’s a bad novel but it’s definitely not as powerful or memorable. Like Normal People, Conversations with Friends has no plot and is about the characters and their relationships. I think part of why Normal People succeeds more is because it’s focused on two people only whereas Conversations with Friends is essentially about four people. We got to know Connell and Marianne more intimately than we do Frances, Bobbi, Nick and Melissa. And though Frances is the main character – the novel is written from her first person perspective – I still felt like I didn’t really understand who she was. Her bisexuality seemed to be a contrivance rather than convincing – does she let Bobbi sleep with her because she is genuinely attracted to her or because she’s weak and submissive? Because she seems vastly more attracted to Nick and much more affected by his actions towards her. I wasn’t sure what drove her literary ambitions or what she was looking for in her affair with Nick. The other characters are even more vaguely sketched. Bobbi and Melissa pootle along fairly one-dimensionally throughout while Nick was largely wishy-washy with the occasional attempt at heartfelt emotion that never felt very persuasive. His and Frances’ relationship was a long way from the great romance of Connell and Marianne’s. It seemed like a very shallow situation - Nick likes having it all: a hot thirtysomething wife as well as a twentysomething mistress. Which makes me wonder what the reader is meant to take away from this book: that these people have gotten themselves into a weird mess that sort of suits them? Intellectuals can be as emotionally immature and/or superficial as anyone else? I’ve no idea – it’s a story that definitely didn’t leave much of an impression on me. Still, it’s mostly a very well-written book that’s easy to read and the dialogue is by turns cogently pretentious (Frances and Bobbi’s group of friends repeating the eye-rolling academic waffle of gender theory definitely sounded like university students’ preening) and realistically everyday when it needed to be. I like that it is so very slice of life, beginning and ending without dramatic contrivance, which is reflected in the matter-of-fact title, yet also never being boring. I know I’ve compared this one to Normal People throughout but that’s only because I came to this book from that. Which I’m glad for as I’m not sure I’d want to have kept reading Sally Rooney had the middling Conversations with Friends been my first experience of her writing. It’s a less compelling and vivid portrayal of young Dubliners in love than Normal People but there’s enough in Conversations with Friends for Sally Rooney fans to enjoy while we wait impatiently for the next one!

84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,Rating 4 out of 5,"Talking ’bout My Generation?Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award shortlist review #2(I am on the official shadow panel of book bloggers.)(Nearly 4.5) The first thing to note about a novel with “Conversations” in the title is that there are no quotation marks denoting speech. In a book so saturated with in-person chats, telephone calls, texts, e-mails and instant messages, the lack of speech marks reflects the swirl of voices in twenty-one-year-old Frances’ head; thought and dialogue run together. This is a work in which communication is a constant struggle but words have lasting significance.It’s the summer between years at uni in Dublin, and Frances is interning at a literary agency and collaborating with her best friend (and ex-girlfriend) Bobbi on spoken word poetry events. She’s the ideas person, and Bobbi brings her words to life. At an open mic night they meet Melissa, an essayist and photographer in her mid-thirties who wants to profile the girls. She invites them back for a drink and Frances, who is from a slightly rough background – divorced parents and an alcoholic father who can’t be relied on to send her allowance – is dazzled by the apparent wealth of Melissa and her handsome actor husband, Nick. Bobbi develops a crush on Melissa, and before too long Frances falls for Nick. The stage is set for some serious amorous complications over the next six months or so.Young woman and older, married man: it may seem like a cliché, but Sally Rooney is doing a lot more here than just showing us an affair. For one thing, this is a coming of age in the truest sense: Frances, forced into independence for the first time, is figuring out who she is as she goes along and in the meantime has to play roles and position herself in relation to other people:At any time I felt I could do or say anything at all, and only afterwards think: oh, so that’s the kind of person I am.I couldn’t think of anything witty to say and it was hard to arrange my face in a way that would convey my sense of humour. I think I laughed and nodded a lot.What will be her rock in the uncertainty? She can’t count on her parents; she alienates Bobbi as often as not; she reads the Gospels out of curiosity but finds no particular solace in religion. Her other challenge is coping with the chronic pain of a gynecological condition. More than anything else, this brings home to her the disappointing nature of real life:I realised my life would be full of mundane physical suffering, and that there was nothing special about it. Suffering wouldn’t make me special, and pretending not to suffer wouldn’t make me special. Talking about it, or even writing about it, would not transform the suffering into something useful. Nothing would.Rooney writes in a sort of style-less style that slips right down. There’s a flatness to Frances’ demeanor: she’s always described as “cold” and has trouble expressing her emotions. I recognized the introvert’s risk of coming across as aloof. Before I started this I worried that I’d fail to connect to a novel about experiences so different from mine. I was quite the strait-laced teen and married at 23, so I wasn’t sure I’d be able to relate to Frances and Bobbi’s ‘wildness’. But this is much more about universals than it is about particulars: realizing that you’re stuck with yourself, exploring your sexuality and discovering that sex is its own kind of conversation, and deciding whether ‘niceness’ is really the same as morality.With its prominent dialogue and discrete scenes, I saw the book functioning like a minimalist play, and I could also imagine it working as an on-location television miniseries. In some ways the dynamic between Frances and Bobbi mirrors that between the main characters in 
Paulina and Fran
 by Rachel B. Glaser, 
Friendship
 by Emily Gould, and 
The Animators
 by Kayla Rae Whitaker, so if you enjoyed any of those I highly recommend this, too. Rooney really captures the angst of youth:You’re twenty-one, said Melissa. You should be disastrously unhappy.I’m working on it, I said.This is a book I was surprised to love, but love it I did. Rooney is a tremendous talent whose career we’ll have the privilege to watch unfolding. I’ve told the shadow panel that if we decide our focus is on the “Young” in Young Writer, there’s no doubt that this nails the zeitgeist and should win.Originally published, with images, on my blog, Bookish Beck."
85,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75953902-sahil-javed,Rating 5 out of 5,"Conversations with Friends is Sally Rooney’s first novel and follows friends Frances and Bobbi and explores the unexpected connection they form when they meet and befriend married couple Melissa and Nick.

“I enjoyed playing this kind of character, the smiling girl who remembered things. Bobbi told me she thought I didn’t have a ‘real personality’, but she said she meant it as a compliment. Mostly I agreed with her assessment. At any time I felt I could do or say anything at all, and only afterwards think: oh, so that’s the kind of person I am.”

Was this book better than Normal People? The first time I read it, the answer was no. But after reading it again, I think it was just as good as Normal People and each time I reread it, I think it's better. Of the two novels, I find myself thinking about this one more and more. And I don't understand why people don't like it. Or, well, maybe I do but I'm just in denial. I also think reading another book by Sally Rooney made me realise just how much I loved Normal People, like I’ve realised I love it even more now than when I finished it. But I also really enjoyed Conversations with Friends. There’s something about Sally Rooney’s books that has me hooked. I think it’s the fact that she introduces and explores such interesting characters and the relationships and the dynamics within those relationships that they have with other people. It’s really interesting because some of her characters are unlikeable at times, but they feel realistic and they always develop as the story goes on and it’s really quite entertaining to read about. 

“You can love more than one person, she said.That’s arguable.Why is it any different from having more than one friend? You’re friends with me and you also have other friends, does that mean you don’t really value me?”

I really liked all of the characters in this book, even though they were all unlikeable at times. The characters that appear in Sally Rooney’s books are always so complex. Frances was a great character. Don’t get me wrong, she was super unlikeable at times, she was quite mean to Nick at certain points in the novel and she wasn’t a nice person at times. But I still cared about her and what happened to her. I wanted her to be happy. It was the same for Bobbi as well, who was also unlikeable but who I cared about immensely. Nick was a really interesting character, and probably my favourite, mostly because he just seemed so vulnerable all of the time and I just wanted to give him a big hug. Also, Melissa was also really complex. I thought she wasn’t that important in the story and that she was quite boring but when Nick told her about his affair with Frances, she wrote Frances a really long email and I feel like that email really showed me a different side to her, and helped me to understand her character more. It was definitely one of the best parts of the book.

“Frances, I want you so badly, he said. I closed my eyes. The words seemed to go past my mind, like they went straight into my body and stayed there. When I spoke, my voice sounded low and sultry. Will you die if you can’t have me? I said. And he said: yes.”

Frances and Nick. Just like Marianne and Connell in Normal People, Frances and Nick were another polarising couple who were unhealthy at times. I liked the way the relationship between the two of these developed and how they were both so afraid to talk about their feelings, or not even afraid, just unwilling. I like that they were both so vulnerable and different points in the novel. What is it with Sally Rooney and miscommunication between characters in relationships? It’s like a running theme. One of Frances and Nick’s biggest problems was the fact that they never communicated properly about what they wanted and how they were feeling, especially Frances who was unbelievably stubborn at times with never disclosing how she truly felt about a situation, instead becoming cold and hostile. But nonetheless, despite the fact that both of these two were frustrating at times, I really liked them together, and I liked the way the novel ended and where we were left with the two of them.

“I should have known it wouldn’t work out between us.Didn’t we always know that? he said.I paused for a second. Then I just said: I didn’t.”

Overall, Conversations with Friends, just like Normal People, has definitely cemented Sally Rooney as an auto-buy author now. If she writes anything else, you can be sure I’ll be the first in line to read it."

Bien, pues eso me sucedió con Conversaciones Entre Amigos. Aquí nos encontramos con Frances, una chica universitaria bisexual irlandesa que en su tiempo libre declama poesía en algunos bares junto con Bobbi, su mejor amiga y exnovia. En uno de estos eventos, Frances y Bobbi conocen a Melissa y Nick, una pareja que se acerca a los cuarenta y que es maravillosa... o al menos eso aparentan. Cuando la relación entre estas dos parejas empieza a crecer, también surge una atracción prohibida, apasionada y turbulenta entre Frances y Nick. Y aquí, señoras y señores, es cuando aparece el salseo y es literalmente imposible dejar de leer el libro. Conversaciones Entre Amigos se plantea como una historia que únicamente puedo definir como digna de chisme. Sally Rooney va desarrollando la trama de una manera en que en lo único que puedes pensar, así estén sucediendo más cosas alrededor, es en Frances y Nick. En cómo sabes que no puede acabar bien, en que la diferencia de edad es bárbara, en que ella nunca ha estado con un hombre, en que sabes que el primero que se enamore va a salir muy mal parado, en cuándo será que los van a pillar, en si Frances quedará embarazada y se montará la de Troya, en si Nick será capaz de dejar la aburrida relación que tiene con Melissa... En fin, que son un sinfín de preguntas e inquietudes morbosas y de cotilla las que te hacen devorar cada una de las páginas de este libro. Una de las cosas que más disfruté del libro fue el estilo de la autora, pues es muy ágil, fresco y, además, tiene algo muy particular y es que no utiliza los diálogos de la manera convencional. Todas las charlas, todas estas conversaciones entre amigos, que están sucediendo aquí están entretejidas como parte de los párrafos. No hay guiones ni nada por el estilo. Y al principio pensé que iba a ser súper confuso, pero no fue así. Es más, este tipo de narración hizo que me sintiera súper cercana a Frances, la protagonista. Me hizo sentir que estaba dentro de su cabeza y que la entendía a la perfección.Y, hablando de la cabeza de Frances, puedo decirles que es un lugar bastante particular. Ella es una chica tremendamente tímida y que, de una manera u otra, siempre ha vivido bajo la sombra de Bobbi, que es la explosiva y extrovertida. Además, Frances está lidiando con muchos problemas en su interior y casi nunca pide la ayuda de nadie. Su padre es alcohólico, está enamorada de un hombre casado y, encima, tiene alguna especie de trastorno psicológico leve que le produce ansiedad e impulsos de autolesionarse para sentir dolor físico y no emocional. Es tremenda. Y, por eso mismo, un personaje fascinante. El otro personaje que, evidentemente, me cautivó de Conversaciones Entre Amigos fue Nick. Es un hombre bastante ambiguo y cuyas intenciones puse en duda durante muchísimas páginas, pues realmente no lograba descifrarlo. No sabía si estaba usando a Frances para desaburrirse o si realmente sentía algo por ella. Nick es un hombre bastante pasivo, que está atrapado en un matrimonio muy insípido y que, además, lucha bastante contra episodios de depresión. Leer la relación que Nick y Frances construían era absolutamente adictivo, como lo son todas las cosas prohibidas, supongo. Todos sus encuentros tenían el toque perfecto de pasión y arrebatos salvajes y palabras tiernas y silencios reconfortantes. Creo que, al saber ambos que lo que hacen no tiene un futuro, lo disfrutan sin las cadenas y dificultades que supone el compromiso. Los dos viven en el momento y lidian con las consecuencias y las mentiras que tienen que ir hilando a su alrededor. Conversaciones Entre Amigos es, también, un libro muy emotivo y que te lleva de la cima de la montaña rusa al vacío en cuestión de segundos. Las relaciones tanto románticas como de amistad no son nada estables, el drama está a la orden del día y las reacciones inesperadas te van a dejar de una pieza. Para terminar, sólo diré que el final del libro me pareció precioso, me llenó de esperanza y de ¿qué pasaría si...? Fue absolutamente hermoso y no puedes dejar de pensar en él, ni siquiera cuando has leído los agradecimientos, has cerrado el libro o, incluso, cuando has empezado otro. Es imposible dejar ir a Frances y Nick. "

I will say, I enjoyed this much more than Normal people, and I think that’s due to Conversations with Friends having much more plot and substance to it. Being in Frances’ brain was fascinating, and I related to both her and Bobbi in a lot of ways which surprised me a lot. Something about Rooney’s books feel so strange, yet so… normal at the same time. I love the open endings, and how real these characters feel in their issues and internal monologues. However, I do think I’ll have more appreciation for this book in a few years when I’m the same age as these characters and am going through similar struggles (hopefully not involving an affair with a married man), so here’s to a reread when I’m in my 20s! 🥂Books around the globe: Ireland"

A bunch of horrible people do horrible things to each other and talk about it.It’s maybe a tenth as clever as it thinks it is.Few books have ever made me as angry as this one. And I’ve read The Sellout. The blurb says you can read this as either a romantic comedy or a feminist text. It is neither.
89,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27615265-elizabeth,Rating 1 out of 5," Review will inevitably contain spoilers because this was just awful.I received a copy of Conversations With Friends from my Secret Santa in 2018. I had never heard of the book or Sally Rooney before and although the blurb didn’t sound like my usual cup of tea I resolved to be objective. This objectivity didn’t survive even the opening paragraph. I don’t even know how to effectively consolidate everything I hate about this book. Rooney states she “didn’t intend to speak for a generation” and I hope Rooney super-fans take this as gospel because they love to do this for Rooney, and talk about how Normal People is a literary voice for the Millennial generation. The protagonists in Conversations With Friends  are everything you hate about supposed Millennial culture. Frances is 21 and has gone from school to college and doesn’t participate in life whatsoever, yet fancies herself a shrewd observer of society and its follies. She identifies as a communist and disparages capitalist society and aspires to not have a job but throughout the novel she consistently covets or accepts the material possessions and experiences she judges others for having, china tea cups, Nick’s expensive coat, a holiday in a French villa at Melissa and Nick’s expense. Her flat is owned by her uncle and she receives a stipend from her alcoholic father yet when she is forced to get a part-time job in a cafe due to her father’s affliction she is utterly humiliated. She doesn’t have a clue. Bobbi is a Millennial caricature of the grotesque kind: she is loud and present and opinionated - everyone is intimidated by her but “everyone loves Bobbi”. She is also an open misandrist and toxic friend with double standards. She uses Frances to gain entry to Melissa’s literary coterie despite contributing only stage presence to their spoken poetry performances, or to humiliate Nick in front of Melissa in an attempt to attract Melissa’s potentially romantic attention, but when Frances tries to whisper in her ear at the book signing to engage Nick’s interest, Bobbi physically grabs and hurts Frances and threatens “don’t fucking use me”. She only cares about Frances if she has her under her thumb and Frances' undivided attention. I was unable to escape the feeling that Frances harbours a genuine fear of her which is really fucked up. Those hailing Rooney as the Millennial It-Author are clearly not of this generation. If you’re a Millennial and you knew Bobbi and Frances in real life, you would absolutely loathe them, let's be honest. They act like absolute “holier than thou” cultural snobs then get angry at everyone for not understanding them. They mock their other “friends” and relish undermining and sniping at them, then validate this with one another’s approval, but how dare anyone else exhibit similar behaviour!“Not everything goes back to cultural theory, said Philip.Oh my God, and they’re going to let you graduate? Bobbi said.[...]Bobbi grinned and sat back in her chair. Philip wasn’t looking at me but at Camille, smiling like they were sharing a private joke. I bristled, since I had stepped in to save him from humiliation, and it was graceless of him not to acknowledge my effort.Bobbi said, Frances? Do you fancy coming out for a cigarette?I followed her.”(p.254-5)This is augmented by how Rooney shoe horns in pseudo-intellectual snippets with no context: “We discussed [insert ideology or critical theory] which, although Bobbi and I have no life experience other than school and university, our similarly read peers evidently incorrectly interpreted Lacan/anyone over 30 had outdated opinions and I knew Bobbi was going to win the debate because she can shout the loudest and throw in a nasty personal slander for the sake of winning a theoretical argument”.Their critique and abhorrence of others in a variety of social circles in which they have no or little experience reminded me of Stephen Daisley’s article in The Spectator and how Bobbi and Frances personify this particular statement:“There is an awful uptightness to our moment, an unforgiving mean-spiritedness passing itself off as enlightenment. The object is the imposition of a total politics but a capricious politics, refracted through a million personal grievances, and more interested in critique than progress. Culture is hectic, protean and ill-suited to the rigid schematics of ideology. Millennial politics dictates who we ought to be but pop culture shows us who we are and who we want to be. Friends, though contrived and confected, was truer to life than the austere anti-culture that has replaced it.”It's not clear-cut whether Bobbi and Frances are intentionally so unlikable, or caricatures of Those Girls in your cultural theory seminar, but if this is the case, then I don't feel Rooney achieves anything, but neither does it read like art for art's sake. If they're genuine characters, then even less is achieved as they go off together at the end, smug and self-convicted as ever. The plot offers nothing new either, there's been plenty of books on naive young adults pursuing unhealthy relationships before, as well as characters who make drama out of nothing and try to drag others in to their narcissism. I hope my Secret Santa doesn’t ask me if I enjoyed the book."

Whether you've experienced the events chronicled in her books or not, she makes the reader feel seen. 💛This book in particular was very hard to read at times, because of what the narrator, Fracis, goes through mentally and physically. At the same time, I couldn't put it down. That's Sally Rooney's second super power, she casts a spell over the reader, one that makes them unable to stop reading.📖This book deals with some very heavy topics such as: infidelity, alcoholism, self-harm, manogomy, polygomy, the patriarchy, and so much more. These aspects of the story make for a very intense reading experience. As I read, I questioned the characters choices and didn't agree with many of them. At times I wanted to reach in and help them in some way...which lead to many scribbled annotations in the margins. Even though I adored this book and gave it 5 stars, it feels wrong to say ""I loved it."" The actions in this story are very hard to ""love."" They challenge the fundamental ""rules"" that make up a ""healthy"" relationship. That relationship not only being romantic, but also connections between friends and family. 💛Now, the thing I love most about Sally Rooney's writing, is that her books have staying power. Once you've read them, they are hard to forget.Normal people daydream about their own lives. Readers day dream about other's lives, usual the ones found in books! And in my very humble opinion, the latter are the best day dreams!"

93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,No Rating,"A review in The New Yorker, and, if I'm honest, a shared surname, led me to this book even though without those two things just listed, I could tell this wasn't my kind of book. The main character is twenty-one but I have placed this on my 'adolescence' shelf because in so many ways she seemed to enjoy one of those long, extended adolescences that Americans have perfected by putting their kids through college, and then grad school in a field where a degree will get you a job in a non-profit working out of a third world country. And of course, keeping these grads on their health insurance until they've paid off their $200K in college loans. But I digress...This is a story in which one of these two adolescent friends thinks it is a good idea to have an affair with a married man (always a bad idea...sorry guys) and unfortunately thinks it is likewise a bright idea to carry on the romance by email late at night. My stomach began to roil, and then recoil...at the utter stupidity of this until her juvenile back-and-forth with her girlfriend literally sent me over the edge. Both girls are living free in space their parents provide and then talk about how they loathe people with money. See what a mean about adolescent? I.just.can't.read.this. Got to pg. 90. Liked one description along the way: ""I felt like I was playing a video game without knowing any of the controls."""

95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75804048-el,Rating 4 out of 5,"once again, sally rooney has written a book that i couldn't put down + read in one single sitting (on twitter, i likened the experience to watching irish reality tv). this time around, the flagrant faults of her novel were not enough to dampen my enjoyment of the narrative, so imagine how surprised i was to find out that this was her debut. this entire time, i thought her debut was normal people! i was so ready to write off normal people's bleak, unimaginative qualities and embrace the clear improvements made here, until i reached the end of conversations with friends and saw that this had been published first—which i still find not a little shocking. i'm of the opinion that normal people the novel shouldn't exist. the similarities between it and this novel are too glaring to ignore. i'm not sure if sally rooney saw the success of her first novel and wanted to replicate it with normal people, or if somehow she's just unable to write main girls who aren't debilitatingly depressed and hate their own bodies (+ take this hatred out on their bodies through their relationships with men), but there were too many eerie parallels between marianne and frances for my liking, especially considering the two cross paths in this novel. here's one example. page 207 of conversations with friends:
i want you to hit me. i don't think i want to do that, he said.i knew that he was sitting up now, looking down at me, though i kept my eyes closed.some people like it, i said.you mean during sex? i didn't realize you were interested in that kind of thing.i opened my eyes then. he was frowning.wait, are you okay? he said. why are you crying? [...] you can do whatever you want with me.yeah, he said. i'm sorry. i don't really know what to say to that.i dried my face with my wrist. never mind, i said. forget about it. let's try and get some sleep.
now look at the near-identical confrontation that happens between marianne and connell on page 198 of normal people:
will you hit me? she says.for a few seconds she hears nothing, not even his breath.no, he says. i don't think i want that. sorry.she says nothing.is that okay? he asks.she still says nothing.do you want to stop? he says. [...] are you okay? he says. i'm sorry i don't want to do that, i just think it would be weird. i mean, not weird, but...i don't know. i don't think it would be a good idea.[...] i think i'm going to go home now, if that's okay, she says.
these are the same scenes, down to the ""i don't think i want to do that/i don't think i want that."" in the case of conversations with friends, i actually liked the placement and handling of this scene, as it's a bit of a one-off. we understand nick to be a pathologically submissive person and frances to be an impulsive control freak who's desperate to establish a sense of total control by any means. this, of course, eventually leads her to make a wild attempt at initiating a violent sexual encounter, either to punish herself for not being enough for nick or to exert ownership over a man married to another woman by playing into/mimicking violently heterosexual sex conventions. here, the scene makes sense, signals a growing loss of control without being heavy-handed, and unravels frances' character enough to make you sit up and take note of it. in normal people, it becomes lazy storytelling, gratuitous overkill, and i still can't say whether rooney is even aware that she repeated this scene across two separate books and couples.like her second book, conversations with friends comes with its own slew of faults. one of the worst, for me, is the novel purporting to really be about the nebulous/fluid love between women the whole time, when bobbi is peripheral at best and always second to the real centerpiece of the narrative—nick. this is not a book about love between women. it's a book about how love between women is jeopardized by the presence of cis heterosexual men + the social compulsion towards their attention/approval, even when we purport to be dominating them on micro- (interaction) levels.and yet, i actually enjoyed this iteration of rooney's ireland. i still took note of the similarities (college, unhealthy relationship to sex/body/gender, creative writer, depressed woman wants to girlboss her way into total autonomy by doing the exact opposite of seeking out autonomy), but here, i felt that they came together in such a way that i could relish the cautionary tale inherent to conversations with friends. if my reading of the novel is false or unintended, that's secondary to the fact that i see this as a story of a twenty-one-year-old—ostensibly, ""the smart one"" who everyone supposes should know better—having to reckon with her own stupidity. it's a story about how even when young women take great strides to unlearn patriarchal violence through theoretical/academic discourse, they can still become defenseless in the face of desirable men. this doesn't have to mean they desire men so much as they desire the life a man can promise them.i saw too much of myself in frances, down to the unemotional control freak with an unstable sense of self, so i admit that a lot of the love i had for this novel comes from the personal resonance i drew from watching her sabotage herself over and over again. i also felt that the characters—especially secondary characters—were a lot fuller here than in normal people, and where the coolly performative millennial discursive slant of normal people was unbearably pretentious, here i thought it worked really well with the cast of artist characters, particularly in the case of frances, who performs her desirability through a ""not like other girls"" intelligence that does not, in fact, save her from being just like other girls when she's diagnosed with endometriosis and winds up discarded by the married man she thought she could find self-actualization through. even the ending, which unravels her progress thus far, i found fitting. something about rooney's invisible prose, the matter-of-fact style of narration she employs to abstract the material over and over again with literary verve, and the detailed mundanity of her characters continues to hook me in, even when everything about the novel crashes and burns. that she ignores certain western genre conventions to capture the fluctuation of daily life only adds to the hyperrealism in her novels that i love so much. and whereas i have no desire to ever pick normal people up again and relive that absurdly stupid love story, with conversations with friends i'm already imagining when i'll next pick it up and what i'll feel if i do. here's hoping her third book offers a departure from her sad pretty girl prototype."

Since then I have seen some pretty lukewarm friend reviews, which lowered my expectations, but I decided that I would like to read it while waiting for her Booker-longlisted new one Normal People to be delivered.I thought this was impressive for a debut novel, but had a few reservations. It is undoubtedly heartfelt, well written and very funny in places, but the plot, such as it is, feels a little cliched - a rites of passage story in which a young woman has an affair with an older married man. If this sounds like chick-lit, it is very much at the literary end of that spectrum, and it does visit some fairly dark places. An enjoyable read, after which I am really looking forward to reading Normal People (my copy of that is now available for collection so I will probably be able to start it later in the weekend)."
101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59497279-maddie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Some books come to you in precise the right time in your life and you can’t help but relate to them, some aspect of them, in such a way that your heart breaks and your stomach turns into knots. My heart broke various times while reading Conversations with Friends and I felt so vulnerable reading it, even writing this review feels like exposing a throbbing wound for everyone to see. In many ways, I feel that’s what our protagonist, Frances, did too, throughout this novel.In Conversations with Friends we follow twenty-one year old Frances as she navigates a year in her life after meeting Melissa, a photographer and writer who takes an interest in her and her best friend (and ex-girlfriend) Bobbie. Alongside Melissa, Nick, Melissa’s husband, also becomes a constant in both girl’s lives, but it is obvious from the start that the connection between Frances and Nick is more than meets the eye, more than they both wish, at first, to recognise. It’s a beautiful and subtle novel with emotionally charged characters and nuances that felt so natural, mirroring the everyday aspects and constants in somebody’s lives: as simple as having a conversation with a friend.Rooney’s politically charged voice often comes through throughout the novel (and she also acknowledges a lot of the conversations in the book were inspired by her own conversations with a couple of friends) and I guess it helped a lot that I was already acquainted with her political views, and that they align with my own -- but I guess that’s just a bonus in the wider context of the novel, as that’s really not the main point of it. It is, in my perspective, about people’s emotional lives and turmoils that can’t be perceptible just from looking at them, the rich turmoils that everyone goes through (in a way or another) and how that inevitably constraints and influences our connections and relationships with others. Also about how there’s really no “black” or “white” answer, no “right” or “wrong” way to deal with matters of the heart. CWF is a celebration of emotional complexity and Rooney picked a theme that will be, one way or another, relatable to everyone.I also loved and connected with Frances so much, I’m almost ashamed to admit it, if, like her, I just like/want to appear cool and aloof."

Absolutely not. Are Frances and Marianne the same woman in different fonts? Absolutely. But SR could write the same version of this character fifty times and I’ll read it again and again and again if we’re being honest. I have no shame in saying I loved this book wholeheartedly (just a little less than NP though).Rooney has this way of writing such realistic characters it blows my mind. They’re flawed, they’re irritating, they have communication issues, they’re liars. I love them every time. They feel so authentic and really come to life, they feel like people I’ve known. She also has the most captivating way of portraying romance, lust, friendship. I can’t help but let her break my heart. I really love what she does with these characters and their lives, she really makes a mundane contemporary consume the entirety of my brain for weeks afterwards.I also appreciated the depiction of endometriosis in this book. I’ve never come across it in fiction before and I’m not very knowledgeable on the topic, but I thought it was handled well. I also loved the snarky social commentary, mental illness, the unpredict nature of human behaviour and the way sexuality was explored. The way she writes romance scenes has me absolutely on my knees. They’re so tender and sensual and some of the most realistic.I just love Rooney’s writing. I wanna be her when I grow up."

Sono solo poche righe intrise di grande delusione, perché di questo romanzo avevo letto meraviglie (almeno fra i lettori italiani, già cercando fra recensioni straniere il numero di stelline mi pare abbassarsi sensibilmente), e invece non sono riuscita nemmeno ad andare oltre pagina 124. Sulla carta, avrei dovuto apprezzare moltissimo tutto questo: una scrittrice della mia generazione che parla dei disagi, delle insicurezze e del modo di intessere relazioni della mia generazione, il tutto con uno stile sorprendente, brillante e incisivo. Fantastico, mi dicevo.Ecco, e invece no. Mi è sembrata tutta una irritantissima posa pseudointellettuale, scritta in maniera piatta e noiosa (davvero basta togliere la punteggiatura ai dialoghi per parlare di stile sorprendente e innovativo? E Saramago allora che cos’è, un alieno capitato su questa terra per errore?), e quando dopo 124 pagine mi sono resa conto che non era successo niente, ma proprio  niente , non ce l’ho più fatta, e l’ho rispedito al mittente (la lunga coda di prenotazioni in biblioteca). La trama (fin dove sono arrivata io) si potrebbe riassumere così: Frances è bisessuale, ha ventun anni, è convinta di essere intelligentissima, scrive poesie ma si limita a performace di spoken word (visto che bello? Parlo di cultura, uso termini giovani, sto scrivendo un romanzo moderno sulla nuova generazione!) ma non vuole pubblicare nulla, perché dopo massimo sei mesi tutto quello che ha scritto le fa schifo. E’ comunista, vuole distruggere il capitalismo e non vuole lavorare, e come darle torto, dato che può vivere nell’appartamento lasciatole dalla zia senza sborsare un centesimo, e per di più ha anche gli assegni di entrambi i genitori (separati) per pagarsi università e tutto quello di cui ha bisogno? Al liceo Frances stava con Bobbi, Bobbi è fantastica, esagerata, anarchica, pure lei vuole distruggere il capitalismo ma si rigira fra le mani bicchieri di champagne agli eventi letterari e culturali della Dublino (Dublino, New York, Londra, mettete quello che vi pare, vi giuro che non cambierebbe assolutamente nulla) più intelligente e artistica. Ora Bobbi e Frances sono amiche, e conoscono Melissa e Nick: dieci anni più di loro, una fotografa importante e un attore che potrebbe essere più famoso, belli e impossibili. Bobbi si invaghisce di Melissa, che sembra ricambiare, Frances invece si invaghisce di Nick, ma non lo vuol dire a nessuno. Tutti si scrivono mail, tutti chattano, tutto �� molto giovane, progressista e moderno, e dopo 124 pagine non era ancora successo praticamente nulla. Non ce l’ho fatta. In alcuni, brevi tratti mi sono riconosciuta in certe insicurezze di Frances, ma il più delle volte la sua voce è quella di una bambina capricciosa che si lamenta di ogni cosa solo per darsi un tono, e, davvero, non ce l’ho proprio fatta. Oh, magari sono io quella troppo ottusa per comprendere il genio di Sally Rooney, magari nelle altre duecento pagine che ho saltato ci sarebbe stata qualche rivelazione catartica in grado di dare un senso a tutta la noia e l’irritazione, eh, ma temo non lo scoprirò mai."

So it would be fair to say I had high hopes for this, especially considering that one of my close friends has repeatedly told me that this is her favourite Sally Rooney novel.Whilst I would probably rank this the lowest of the three books by Sally Rooney that I have read, I still thought it was really great, and a book that I would certainly highly recommend. Wonderful exploration of character, with incredible crafting of relationships and interactions. No one can really do these things like Sally Rooney. She has just mastered the creation of contemporary relationships and conflicts, both with society and oneself. The interweaving of internal and external conflict of a small group of characters is done in such a way that engaged me so, so much, and mae=kes this feel like such. real and vivid read. What I would say makes this slightly different, and just that little bit less effective than her other works, is that some of the very powerful points Sally Rooney makes are made explicitly clear, whereas they were obvious but implied in Normal People and Beautiful World, Where Are You. I think that shows that Sally Rooney has honed her craft, and this is still a great work of literature. I will certainly be reading whatever she puts out to the world in the future.4/5 STARS"

3.5 stars
This is a competently written, realistic novel, but I can't help feel that it's also somewhat lacking in depth and character development. I really liked the ending and the way Rooney characterized her protagonist (I saw a lot of myself — or rather, the worst parts of myself — in her); at the same time though, I found her character arc to be deeply frustrating. To me, this whole story felt like a missed opportunity to tackle the toxic dynamics that regulate many modern relationships. The author depicted a multitude of unhealthy relationship habits without ever analyzing the way they affect individuals or openly addressing them as destructive. The perfect example of this narrative pattern is the way Bobbi, Frances's hipster ex girlfriend, is written: she's a hypocritical, aggressive, and narcissistic person who is never called out on her bullshit or her abusive conduct towards the people in her life.This dynamic inevitably resulted in a mounting sense of frustration on my part, which could be what Rooney was aiming for but also made the book feel pointless up to a certain point. Although I appreciated the final resolution and the positive message it was trying to send, I still felt like the critique of modern friendships/romance that the author was going for could have been handled a little better."

But maybe it listening to this as an audio book or maybe just me growing a little tired of Rooney's style after her disappointing third novel, I didn't love it as much this time and I changed the rating back to four stars. Strangely, this time it was the main character, Frances, that I didn't really like as much. _________Original review from half a year ago is below. I've re-read this, which is something I rarely do, and I've changed the rating from 4 to 5 stars. I found it for 1,5 pounds in a charity shop here and thought it might be good to re-read someone's style I admire. I also hoped I might appreciate the book more this time around, not reading it right after and thereby comparing it with Rooney's second book ""Normal People"", which had touched me more. I was right. This time I around I was more engaged, I could appreciate all of the characters more and I didn't dislike Bobbi or Melissa as much - or when I did, I realized we were only experiencing them from Frances' warped mind. I felt that even when they were annoying, they seemed very real and true to life. The ending of the novel got me really emotional this time around. So while I still might appreciate Normal People more, both of her books are excellent!---This is a novel about a 21 year old woman, Frances, her best friend/ex-girlfriend Bobbi, and the married couple Nick and Melissa, who are more a decade older than the two. Bobbie is interested in Melissa, while Frances falls in love with Nick and they start having an affair. The book also deals with class differences, endometriosis, mental illness, art, literature and lots of other things, but the main thing are these human relationships. You won't like this book if you don't enjoy reading about miscommunication and people not being able to articulate what they really feel. It's difficult to decide between four and five stars right now, but the fact that I'm hesitating tells me I should go with four. Which is to say: This book is very very good, I really could not put it down, I admire the writing - but I'm not sure whether I ""loved"" it as such. Naturally, I couldn't help compare it the author's second novel, ""Normal People"", which I loved almost unconditionally. They are quite similar in theme and tone. But I didn't feel quite as strongly for ""Conversations with Friends"", mainly because it didn't touch me as much. This novel felt a bit more constructed, emotionally manipulative and - and I think this is the main difference - I didn't feel as close to the characters. I felt for Frances, but I found her incredibly frustrating. I greatly disliked Bobbie and Melissa (we were supposed to dislike them both, right?). I did like Nick, but since we only see him through Frances' eyes, it's difficult to get really close to him. I don't mind morally ambiguous characters at all. It was more the fact that I kept wanting to shake them all to stop them from behaving like idiots. The ending was great, very poignant. While I wasn't as magically entranced by this book like I was with the author's follow up (and not as envious of her skills), I felt the same inability to stop reading.

Frances and Bobbi are 21 year olds studying in a university in Dublin meet Melissa, who's much older than them and they are instantly attracted to her life, house, relationship and whatnot. they quickly become friends and their relationship with each other (i.e) Frances, Bobbi, Nick (who's Melissa's husband) and Melissa gets intertwined and soon becomes a mess. Shockingly, the writing didn't bother me that much this time. I didn't love the writing style but Sally Rooney is so fucking talented! she can write characters so well. every single one of them is morally ambiguous and while reading the book, you can't help but draw comparisons, at least i did. they are flawed, real and authentic. she focuses on several issues, like she did in normal people, such as money, relationships, friendship, race, sex and mental health. Frances was really like ""hm, what's a healthy relationship with boundaries? i don't know her."" lol not that i'm judging.[image error]i think i loved the book even more bc of how it never makes any single one of them as villain. their decisions while flawed are very understandable. it is very much a character driven novel so idk how much i can speak without spoiling or giving away something.""You underestimate your own power so you don't have to blame yourself for treating other people badly."" as the title suggests, these ""friends"" talked about everything. their conversations were deep and meaningful sometimes and other times, as trivial as it can get and that's why it genuinely felt like a real conversation. in conclusion, i loved this book and i think everyone should give it a go, even the ones who didn't like normal people. i think especially those people! maybe i should reread normal people? bc i loved the tv adaption. let's see!ps. i can’t wait to watch the hulu adaptation of this book!!!"

Mia madre diceva che i fratelli e le sorelle di mio padre avevano ricevuto le stesse telefonate, ma che cosa potevamo farci? Quando andavano a trovarlo non era mai in casa. Spesso sentivo delle macchine passare in sottofondo, e capivo che era fuori. Ogni tanto poi sembrava preoccupato per la mia incolumità. Mi diceva di stare attenta a non farmi trovare. Dicevo: d’accordo, papà. Non mi troveranno. Qui sono al sicuro.Ammetto che tutto l’hype che Einaudi aveva voluto costruirci attorno, qualche settimana fa, m’aveva fatto storcere il naso. Ed ero abbastanza sicuro che non mi sarebbe piaciuto. Mi sbagliavo. La trama non è irresistibile. La scrittura è precisa ma non di quelle che proprio ti si incollano addosso. Eppure questo libro ha una sua alchimia e va abbastanza vicino al bersaglio. Non ha cedimenti netti e ha dalla sua dei dialoghi che, senza strafare, mi sono sembrati efficaci e credibili. E mi pare che più o meno tutto si misura su quello: le parole che diciamo e le parole che ascoltiamo.Cose da ricordare: l’ambientazione dublinese, gente che alza le spalle di continuo e la doppia citazione di Greta Gerwig.

Abbiamo alzato le spalle. Era una relazione e al tempo stesso non lo era. Ogni nostro gesto era spontaneo, e se dall’esterno sembravamo una coppia, a noi pareva un’interessante coincidenza. Su questo abbiamo coniato una battuta, che non aveva senso per nessuno comprese noi: che cos’è un amico? dicevamo comicamente. Che cos’è una conversazione?”  Inizio questo libro con una profonda ansia.Non voglio ammetterlo ma c’è e mi spinge a girare le pagine in cerca di un atteso colpo di fulmine. «Sì! M’innamorerò di questa storia. Rimarrò folgorata da questa scrittura».Proseguo con questo pensiero inconscio.Le pagine scorrono ma la pazza corsa adrenalinica che ti butta a capofitto nella vita immaginata da qualcun altro non c’è. E’ tutto più simile ad una passeggiata in una piatta campagna dove ben presto la monotonia del paesaggio diventa protagonista.Frances ci racconta la sua storia.Il suo primo grande amore vissuto con al liceo con la compagna Bobbi. Si lasciano ma continuando ad avere un simbiotico legame profondo.Sono poco più che ventenni e insieme si esibiscono nello spoken word: poesie recitate.Una sera conoscono una coppia più matura: Melissa scrittrice e fotografa di discreto successo e il marito Nick attore. Nonostante tra le due sia Bobbi quella più intrigante ed affascinante, è proprio Frances ad attrarre Nick…Ecco, una storia molto reale, contemporanea come contesto e dinamiche. Così anche la scrittura: lineare, frizzante nelle immagini per cui è facile sentire che chi scrive è una giovane donna. Ecco, che, all’improvviso, questa linearità ha un guizzo; una curva inaspettata che fa intravedere in immagini concentrate un’inaspettata profondità:” Quella sera, dopo che Bobbi se n’è andata, ho scritto per un’ora e mezza, dei versi in cui immaginavo il mio corpo come un rifiuto, un imballaggio vuoto o un frutto mezzo mangiato e buttato via.”Vent’anni pieni di speranze, illusioni e soprattutto la spontaneità del vivere per vivere:” Mi sono interrogata su di te, ha detto. Si direbbe che non hai nessun piano.Già, di piani proprio non ne ho.Speri solo di cadere in piedi.”Millennial/Generazione Y/Next Generation…...comunque la si voglia etichettare è la generazione dove ci si scherma con la tecnologia. Il mondo delle relazioni non fa paura se si possono prendere le distanze tramite uno schermo di pc o di smartphone. E’ una generazione su cui si punta l’indice per la superficialità, la mancanza d’impegno civico eppure dietro a tutto questo bisogno di esporsi e di esibirsi c’è anche un mettere in atto un grande lavoro di trasformazione nel mondo delle relazioni.I rapporti diventano più disinibiti sessualmente e la trasgressione dei paradigmi si disancora dalla condizionante educazione cattolica. Si sdogana l’adulterio perché è il concetto di coppia stesso ad essere ridiscusso. E’ poi proprio vero che si può amare un’unica persona?Il mondo del sesso diventa fluido; spezza le catene; si libera…Il caos dei vent’anni. Il mondo infantile è ormai scomparso portandosi dietro i suoi cadaveri. Il mondo adulto si accosta ma non c’è volontà di entrare nel cerchio. E’ l’età dell’indeterminato: amore, amicizia con labili contorni. Vie di fuga ed entrate laterali per poter sfuggire e rientrare a piacimento.La storia di Frances, però, contiene di più. C’è tanta sofferenza trascinata. Tanto dolore da non riuscire a definirsi. Restare una nebulosa, non trovare forma, consistenza, significato. Allora ci si fa del male fisicamente. Vedere sgorgare il sangue. Sentire il dolore fisico sono forme sì di autopunizione ma anche il bisogno di una prova che altrimenti non si riesce ad afferrare: provare a se stessi di esistere veramente! “Parlarne tra amici” in originale “Conversations with friends”. E’ quello che ci si aspetta tra ragazzi: confidenze, consigli, quello svuotarsi…in realtà Frances non riesce a farlo. E’ bloccata. Indossa maschere.Un buon libro che entra piano piano e ci racconta di questi nostri giorni. -Colonna sonora-” Mancava ancora una settimana all’inizio del semestre, e nel frattempo Bobbi si era comprata un ukulele rosso e aveva preso l’abitudine di sdraiarsi sul divano a suonare Boots of Spanish Leather mentre io preparavo la cena.”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxodx...”…a volte, ultimamente, mi sembra di guardarti scomparire…Billie Holiday - I'm A Fool to Want You.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouuRs..."

Oh Sally Rooney to you I can only say WERK KWEEN . . . . . 

(I didn’t really pull that off, did I????)Anyway, this one wasn’t quite as mind-blowing as Normal People, but at this point I feel pretty confident saying if Rooney writes it, Imma probably read it. I like broken people and not-really-okay romantic entanglements the way she delivers them. Sometimes it’s just nice to read something where you don’t have to like the characters or their actions in order to still become fully invested in the story.I started this while waiting for my kids’ nine millionth baseball game of the year to start because I had a paper copy and the glare was so horrific there was no way I could read any of my Kindle options. I figured it would pass the hour warm-up period and I would put it away easily. That was not the case. Instead I read this cover to cover and someone had to give me a shove whenever my kid came up to bat because I was pretty much in a trance.Not for everyone, but it was certainly for me . . . .

I suppose it shouldn't surprise me that I find myself reading two books in a row that feature adultery as a main theme. After all, Robert Sapolsky, whose Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst is my book of the decade (still waiting for it to come back so I can start the re-read) claims that most of Western literature can be explained by the fact that human beings are neither clearly a tournament species nor a pair-bonding species, but somewhere in between. I missed out the twentieth century, leaping straight from Fontane to this ultra-hip, post-crisis, post-post-modern, indeed post-Irish world. There is that mainstay of Irish writing, the alcoholic father, but he has been banished to a place where he can do little harm except to himself. What we don't have are large families, or poverty, or people repressed by church or state. Frances' Mum thinks it's a shame when she breaks up with her girlfriend Bobbi. Frances and Bobbi continue to perform at poetry slams and open mikes, and Frances makes a very credible poet, her narrative voice is fresh, startling, engaging (I loved the voice). Through their performances, they get to meet the privileged 'arty' set, an essayist and photographer, her handsome actor husband. The stage is set for a ménage à quatre it would seem. Well, that would be too easy. You wonder why it's so hard.You wonder why no-one is at ease with themselves, why they all examine themselves and their motives in the minutest detail, and seem rigidly confined by cages of their own fashioning. They are constantly trying to find labels that will adequately describe themselves: I'm gay, I'm a communist, I'm a neurotic individualist - Frances claims she's emotionally cold, although the reader swiftly sees through that claim, nae bother. Is that it? Everyone is putting on this façade of being super-cool, in control, unfazed by anything. Is this the ultra modern hip world? Almost as obsessed by what-will-people-think as the nineteenth century? Achieved through the social control of modern social media? Not only is love not the answer to everything, it isn't even the question."
132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12859342-skyler-autumn,Rating 3 out of 5," 3 Stars  Conversation with Friends while enjoyable during the read has now a few day later taken on a more tepid feel. Although cleverly written and I have no doubt Sally Rooney is going to write a book so sensational it puts her even more on the literary map (already hearing massive buzz about her next novel Normal People), Conversation with Friends has really made no lasting impression on me. Even though I've only been done reading it for a week the story and its characters are already dissolving from my mind leaving me a little unsure if I truly did enjoy this book. Conversation with Friends, revolves around 21 year old Francis who in stereotypical college student waxing poetic about life, love and sex while engaging in only intellectually stimulating dialogue with her surrounding peers and sneers at individuals that say they enjoy the the work of Yeats. She's at the universal age where you begin to believe you are smarter then you truly actually are. This is shown more eloquently with her relationship and inevitable affair with a married man. The man is a wet drip of a human and she is naive and they enter a toxic relationship. You are brought along on this journey because the prose are pretty and you don't really care that story is small and the characters are irritating. The writing is so gorgeous you almost are lulled into this novel and are actually sad when reaching the conclusion. Sally Rooney is gorgeous writer that took a story that in lesser writers hands I'd find redundant and dull and actually engaged me. I will follow this author and read her next novel because if she is able to hold my interest with such an unimaginative story and unlikable characters I can only imagine what she is going to be capable of in the future."
133,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a hard book to rate and review: on one hand, I didn't find it particularly sharp or witty or sparkling as claimed in the blurb; on the other, I gulped it down in a day. It's certainly easy and untaxing reading (so good for commutes, holidays etc.) but is still a step-up from chick-lit. Frances, the first-person protagonist, is a blurry character: her role in the story is a pretty dominant and dominating one yet her voice makes her out to be always vulnerable, always second in her head to other people: her best friend and some-time lover, Bobbi; the older man with whom she has an awkward affair. This definitely feels like yet another book influenced by Lena Dunham et al. but for all its hipster credentials (Frances and Bobbi are Trinity Dublin students on the spoken word circuit, Frances writes poetry and wants to destroy capitalism) the book this reminded me of most is Edna O'Brien's classic The Country Girls. There's a similar naivety about Frances, the old dynamic of young woman/older man, body issues and vulnerabilities - and it's somewhat depressing to think that a book written in 1960, almost 60 years ago, still has currency here however different the superficial trappings are.So I'm a bit on the fence with this one: it's an enjoyable enough switch-off read but somewhat disappointing in relation to some of the enthusiastic press reviews I've read, and not nearly as fresh, clever and hip as it perhaps could have been.Thanks to the publisher for an ARC via NetGalley"

136,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4686064-rajat-ubhaykar,Rating 4 out of 5,"Conversations With Friends doesn't have a plot to speak of. The title makes that amply clear. The book does feature many intelligent conversations among friends, but essentially, it is all about its principal character and narrator Frances, a 21 year old Irish student and writer who lives in Dublin. Frances is so painfully self-aware that reading this book is like inhabiting the body of another person. And not an entirely likeable or mentally stable one at that, which can be an unsettling experience at times. It is also a very sensory experience. France notices every tiny thing about her body and her surroundings, which means you are privy to every slight change in her physicality or what Bobbi, her best friend and former lover, would call the 'physical symptoms of capitalism'. That you're able to (eventually) empathize with self-absorbed Frances to such an extent is Rooney's biggest achievement.The other (equally self-absorbed) characters appear only as brief stimulants for the inner turmoil of Frances. Nor do we know how Frances appears to them, except in some tangible ways, which include e-mail or dialogue. In a way, this only emphasizes the unknowability of people in general, even those closest to you. You trapped in your body and me in mine, we will never know what the other truly feels. It is also in many ways a book about class. Frances is not rich, but also not exactly poor. She's making her first tentative forays into a class above her, the Trust Fund class, whose houses are spotless, as if they're wiped clean by house elves every night; whose sources of sustenance are mysterious; who grind small, expensive coffee beans themselves before drinking it; and among whom, mental illnesses no longer has 'unfashionable connotations'. Thrown into these circumstances, Frances has no choice but to 'learn a new set of assumptions and feign a greater level of understanding than she really possesses'. To make matters more complicated, both Frances and Bobbi are reluctant participants in the market economy, both being edgy individuals of Marxist/anarchist persuasion. Frances has calculated that anything above an annual income of $16000 wouldn't sit well with her conscience, the figure being the per capita GDP of the world according to Wikipedia. It is the kind of book where you can't decide if discussing anarchism while sipping wine in a French chateau is an ironic act or a hypocritical one, or if capitalism has obliterated the distinction between the two.This sort of post-capitalist mood also pervades the prose. It is a book where you don't surf or browse the internet, you 'read the Internet', Internet having been rendered a banal source of information, not an endless ocean to surf. I also really liked how Rooney doesn't use any quotation marks - the dialogue is seamlessly woven into the paragraphs - and is still completely comprehensible. This probably derives from a sort of post-Internet internalization of language, a verbalization of English that comes from incessant chatting on smartphones, where punctuation marks are employed strictly where needed. Indeed, chat and e-mail feature as prominent drivers of the plot. In fact, it is only in e-mails that the characters are truly able to express themselves and their feelings for each other. Verbally, they mostly come across as inscrutable, bound by the constraints of social etiquette that doesn't leave much scope for genuine interaction beyond polite pleasantries. I won't give away the premise and the (thin) plot of the book, but I'll say read Sally Rooney, if only to learn how to get inside a character's head, and to understand how human beings have started to behave in a highly connected, yet increasingly isolated world, captured in all of its awkward ambiguity. It's like the book equivalent of a Greta Gerwig or Noah Baumbach movie."

Y además de este estudio psicológico y social, es capaz de integrar reflexiones sobe el mundo cultural y la burguesía, tensiones entre clases sociales, e incluso la presencia del catolicismo en al sociedad irlandesa.

(dù điều đó cũng không cứu vãn mọi thứ cứ rối tinh cả lên và họ vẫn cứ đau khổ u buồn như thường), họ gửi cho nhau những email dài giải bày tình cảm của mình, họ biết cách kết thúc mối quan hệ một cách rõ ràng và biết cách thể hiện cảm xúc (tới đây lại nhớ lời bài hát của Quốc Bảo: ""cũng may là đã từng yêu đàng hoàng, cũng may là thấy tình tôi gọn gàng""). Đọc cuốn sách mà cứ nghĩ đúng là thôi có gì cứ nói ra hết với đối phương cho nhẹ lòng rồi sau đó cứ ra sao thì ra chứ giữ trong lòng mệt người hơn thôi =))))Nhưng tóm lại thì kết thúc cuốn sách, chỉ một câu nói của nhân vật chính thì lại làm mọi chuyện bung bét cả lên lại sau khi cứ tưởng mọi thứ đã xong xuôi, gọn gàng kết thúc trong yên bình, nhưng mà đó cũng là câu tôi thích nhất trong cuốn sách và mới thấy kết thúc xuất sắc mới khổ chứ, mà kiểu như tự tôi thấy mọi thứ sẽ lại tiếp tục bung bét chứ tác giả không hề viết tiếp, hóa ra cuộc đời vẫn tiếp diễn ngoài trang sách và người ta vẫn lao vào yêu nhau bất chấp dù câu chuyện đã kết thúc. Nói chung là một cuốn sách hài hước và cũng buồn bã, gọn gàng và vẫn rối nùi, bể tim mà vẫn xoa dịu, khùng điên mà vẫn chân thật, hãy đọc đi trước khi quá già các bạn ạ ;)"

Zanimljivo u smislu da jednostavnim, čistim, preciznim, ogoljenim izrazom zaista uspijeva uhvatiti trenutak sadašnjice i to je definitivno velika i sjajna stvar. Mnogo mi se svidjelo to kako tu jednostavnost jezika kombinuje s temama koje su definitivno obilježje vremena u kojem živimo (napori koji se ulažu da se shvati sopstveno mjesto u svijetu, odnos prema ljubavi i vezama, ne samo onim ljubavnim, pokušaj razumijevanja alternativnih verzija međuljudskih odnosa i sve kompleksnosti fenomena komunikacije) i što tom kombinacijom uspijeva da gradi likovi koji su zaista slojeviti, uvjerljivi, prepoznatljivi i s kojima se u nekoj mjeri lako poistovjećivati. Da, naravno da nas ti likovi povremeno nerviraju svojim odlukama, postupcima i izgovorenim stavovima i koliko god da nekad izgledaju banalno ili svedeno na neki stereotip (npr. te kao onako u razgovor ubačene reference), to ih samo na još jedan način čini uvjerljivijim. Pobogu, ti likovi imaju dvadesetak godina, takve stvari im priliče :D Zaista cijenim to što se neko na ovako posvećen, detaljan i promišljen način uhvatio ukoštac sa svim problemima koji opterećuju mlade danas, što je neko u tome pronašao zaista zanimljiv materijal za pisanje, a posebno cijenim to što u knjizi zaista nema tona koji bi upućivao na neko autorkino osuđivanje sopstvenih likova (koliko god zna da ih stavlja u situacije koje nisu nimalo zavidne), nema onog tako napornog moralisanja, nema konačnih odgovora i dobro/loše ocjena i komentara. E sad, i pored svh ovih sjajnih stvari, ostao mi je neki utisak polovičnosti, možda preciznije nedovršenosti i nedorađenosti, i to ne samo zbog samog kraja, koji je takav kakav jeste. Opet, nakon čitanja i druge njene knjige, rekla bih da je to možda i sastavni dio njenog pisanja. U svakom slučaju, stvarno jedna istinski interesantna pojava."

All due to Francis. Fucking Francis... *enraged sigh* I hated her. HATED HER. I couldn’t stand her. My eyes were perpetually rolling at everything that came out of her mouth, it was like, give me a break already, ffs. At best she was a selfish hypocrite and a walking contradiction. At worst ...

SO MUCH. maybe it is because of her attitude and feelings toward life, her own existence and other people around her. however even i don't feel the exact same way as frances does all the time. i just have a feeling that her attitude and thoughts might bear resemblance to mine. or it can be due to sally rooney's writing, which has the ability to open my mind and really make me listen to my soul, or the ability to make whoever reads this book perceive something in them that they have never acknowledged before.this book is depressing. i feel numb. and i now feel deep affection and hold much respect for sally rooney as a person and a writer."

Po przeczytaniu „Rozmów z przyjaciółmi” wiem, że bez zastanowienia kupię wszystko, co kiedykolwiek wyda autorka — od teraz już oficjalnie jedna z moich ulubionych.Frances pisze wiersze, które prezentuje na slamach poetyckich wraz ze swoją przyjaciółką i byłą dziewczyną, Bobbi. Przypadkiem poznaje Melissę, popularną dziennikarkę, i jej męża, z którym nieoczekiwanie zaczyna łączyć ją głębsza relacja, dzięki której spróbuje po raz pierwszy zrozumieć i zdefiniować siebie samą.Opis „Rozmów z przyjaciółmi” sugeruje odbiorcy rasową telenowelę, ale nie do końca tak jest. Jasne, między bohaterami dochodzi do różnych spięć i dramatów, które kończą się trzaśnięciem drzwiami i milczeniem, ale hej, w końcu to Sally Rooney, więc oczywiście jest tutaj o wiele więcej. Czasami między wierszami, a czasami zupełnie wprost. Pojawiają się tutaj tematy znane już z „Normalnych ludzi” — krytyka kapitalizmu, problemy rodzinne, różnice klasowe między postaciami.Książki Rooney są, najogólniej mówiąc, o tym, że każdy z nas, niezależnie od wieku i doświadczeń, bywa pogubiony i próbuje się jakoś odnaleźć w świecie, który ma bardzo mało zrozumienia dla naszych słabości. I o tym, że szukamy ciepła, miłości, akceptacji i poczucia własnej wartości. Najczęściej w innych ludziach. I ja właśnie za to Rooney uwielbiam, za tę normalność bohaterów jej powieści, za ich błędy i niepewność. Nie ma dla mnie nic bardziej ludzkiego, pięknego i prawdziwego w literaturze niż właśnie taki sposób patrzenia na człowieka."

At only 27, the grasp she has on human nature is astonishing, and I can’t wait to see how she grows as a writer..Conversations with Friends is the introspective story of what happens when two college friends, Frances and Bobbi, enter into the somewhat glamorous world of journalist Melissa and actor Nick, a married couple. Rooney wastes no words, but says everything she needs to say, and it was refreshing (if a little weird on occasion) to read from the point of view of a 21 year old woman I could identify with on many levels..I absolutely love books which are essentially just character studies - observing how a person is, their vulnerabilities, their ambitions (or lack thereof), what makes them tick, and then exploring those traits in relation to other people, seeing how they react together and affect one another. I also usually don’t like it when authors make use of modern phenomena like facebook in their books, but Rooney wields them with confidence and to great effect..Touching on subjects such as infidelity, parental relationships, sexual identity, and an illness not usually talked about, endometriosis, Rooney has penned what I think is a masterpiece of the millennial, if you’ll excuse my alliteration..I took off half a star because I thought we’d get to see more of another side of the story (Bobbi and Melissa’s relationship), and we didn’t, but Nick and Frances’s was so fascinating that I’ll let it slide."

Jest w całej swojej formie trochę zneutralizowana, jakby samodzielnie nie wyciągała żadnych wniosków z czytelnika, tylko pozwalała mu na nieoceniającą otwartość. Styl autorki doskonale współgra z tą fabularną i postaciową przenikliwością, nawet drobne upolitycznienia i wzmianki na temat klasowości czy pozycji społecznej mają w sobie coś z przezroczystości, ale wyłącznie w dobrym znaczeniu i kontekście.Ta powieść jest właśnie kwintesencją rozmów z przyjaciółmi - przemilczanych, szczerych, chaotycznych i emocjonalnych wymian siebie nawzajem.Być może nie empatyzuję z nią na płaszczyźnie pragnień i motywów bohaterów, być może w tym znaczeniu nawet jej nie zrozumiałam, ale potrafię jakoś dziwnie tę książkę współodczuwać.

151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115890-constantine,Rating 4 out of 5,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐Genre: Contemporary Romance + LGBTQConversations with Friends is about Frances and Bobbi, two college students who find themselves in the middle of an intricate web of relationships. As their relationship progresses, they discover hidden details about each other's pasts, as well as how their lives become intertwined with that of a married couple named Melissa and Nick. As the relationships between the four characters get more complicated, Frances and Bobbi are forced to face their own feelings and learn how to deal with the often unpredictable world of modern relationships. Along the way, they learn how important it is to understand each other, how important it is to keep lines of communication open, and how powerful friendship can be.I really love Sally Rooney’s writing style and the subjects she delves into in her novels. This is her third book that I read after Normal People and Beautiful World, Where Are You?, both of which I thoroughly enjoyed. There is something about her writing that really clicks with me. I love the way she builds her characters, who are flawed like all of us. This one also has flawed characters. They are quite complex and well-developed. The story is told from the perspective of Frances, a college student living in Dublin. We get to see the story unfold with insight and emotion as she deals with the complexities of friendship, love, and her own identity.The book is engaging, and the writing is simply beautiful. Rooney's prose is lyrical, and her narrative is captivating. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read, especially if you are already a fan of the author’s writing. "
152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4009947-anthony,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is an exceptionally subtle, perceptive, achingly honest portrait of a young woman whose blazingly bright overall intelligence doesn’t easily translate into emotional intelligence. I was thoroughly compelled throughout by Rooney’s lucid, sharply observed rendering of her narrator’s voice, and I am very impressed by the manner in which Rooney wove in textures relating to mental illness, class differences, what it means to be young, to be a woman, to be married, to be drawn to self-harm. Ultimately, while I was very drawn into this novel, I also hoped for its emotional weight to take me to a slightly more powerful and transcendent place than it wound up doing. So this is an unusually strong 4-star rating from me, as I was very very impressed but not quite totally blown away. I look forward to reading Normal People, which has also received a tremendous amount of acclaim. "

If you met them socially you’d make an excuse and move on. Every character is thoroughly unlikeable. There are no real conversations, rather some rehashed first year university essays.

155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11296522-fatma,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 starsI've decided that I love everything that Sally Rooney has ever written or will ever write. Everything about her stories just clicks with me: the characterization, the themes, the writing style. Something about the way Rooney crafts her stories really reminds me of Jane Austen's novels (which, as pretty much everyone knows at this point, I LOVE), not necessarily because of her narratives or themes, but because of the feel of her writing. Just like Austen's, Rooney's writing is deceptively simple; on the surface, it's brusque and straightforward. But it's a simplicity that hides complexity, a simplicity that's made even more complex by the fact that it hides that complexity. I'm also endlessly intrigued by Rooney's characterization. Her characters are so cerebral, often taking themselves as objects of inquiry, examining and evaluating their emotions and actions. And yet their cerebral nature makes them more complicated than clear. I think Frances especially is an interesting character because it can be quite disorienting being in her head. She's not exactly forthcoming with her emotions, but that implies that she actually understands those emotions: she doesn't, not always at least. You'd think that having her as your POV character would illuminate rather than obscure her internal experiences, but her internal experience itself is characterized by her inability to figure out what it is she's experiencing in the first place. IT'S FASCINATING.One last thing: I am always so impressed by the way Rooney ends her novels, especially this particular one. (The ending to this novel was beautiful, not because it was poetic or devastating, but because it was pared-down and simple; it hit its mark precisely and effectively.) Her novels never end with some momentous or cataclysmic event, neither do they end in the ways you'd expect—or even want—them to. They're always a little off-center, solid enough in that they give you some closure, but malleable enough that they always leave some things up in the air. I just love this book. I want to pick it apart, read between its seemingly simple lines. I could keep gushing about it (and I do want to), but instead I'm just going to leave you with a quote which I think encapsulates the substance of Rooney's writing, the way it puts the momentous and the mundane on a level playing field.
""I went into the living room, where Bobbi was watching a documentary about Algeria. She patted the couch cushion beside her and I sat down. Do you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing with your life? I said. I'm actually watching this, said Bobbi.I looked at the screen, where old wartime footage was overlaid with a voice-over explaining the role of the French military. I said: sometimes I just feel. And Bobbi placed a finger over her lips and said: Frances. I'm watching.""

Abbiamo complesse relazioni interpersonali, tradimenti e sensi di colpa, persone che cercano di dimostrarsi superiori a gelosie e rancori nel nome della modernità e di una superiorità intellettuale ma che vi soccombono come tutti, increduli di questo fatto.E una protagonista con un mare problemi emotivi e psicologici (non l'unica dei personaggi, ma il punto di vista che abbiamo è il suo, quindi lei è quella che conosciamo meglio).Abbiamo la questione se sia possibile o meno, etico o meno, morale o meno il fatto di amare più persone. Abbiamo omosessualità, bisessualità, panamorismo.Abbiamo anche una ""situazione"" sulla riviera francese che richiama Fitzgerald.E poi abbiamo il messaggio finale, cioè che per quanto uno si possa vedere e credere in una determinata maniera, finché una situazione non la vive non può sapere come si comporterà.""Prima di capire certe cose le devi vivere. Non puoi sempre assumere una posizione analitica.""Per tutto questo, e per via della scrittura scorrevole dell'autrice, mi stupisco di non aver sentito l'affinità che mi aspettavo con questo libro. Ma purtroppo non è scattato quel ""qualcosa"" che ti trasporta nelle pagine, che ti fa vivere le situazioni e immedesimare nei personaggi.Alla fine Nick e Frances mi ispiravano più che altro irritazione, e la persona che vedevo come la ""migliore"" del cast, Bobbi, risulta essere talmente anticonformista da essermi aliena, a un livello empatico.Quindi si, lettura scorrevole e piacevole, ma non mi ha emozionato né trasmesso chissà cosa, malgrado gli ingredienti fossero tutti presenti."

Bravo, Sally Rooney.I was very open on Goodreads about how long it took me to really get into Conversations With Friends. I was a bit unsure about whether I understood the characters; I wasn't really engaging with the story; I was reading other things that demanded my attention more. Pay no heed to any of that: once I committed myself to this book, it completely opened up to me and I appreciated it on a whole other level.Francis and Bobbi are two 21-year-olds on their summer holidays from Trinity College Dublin. They used to date in school but are still friends, and spend their time performing spoken word poetry as a double act. After one particular performance, they meet Melissa, a photographer and essayist, who wants to profile them for a prestigious magazine. They accept an invitation to her house in a wealthy part of Dublin, where they meet her husband, Nick, a handsome actor. While Bobbi falls under the spell of Melissa, it seems, Francis is drawn to Nick and ends up in bed with him. This new relationship puts an emotional divide between Francis and Bobbi, upsetting their familiar dynamic, and this novel tracks the effects of the affair on Francis. The discussion and portrayal of relationships in Conversations With Friends is both intelligent and revealing. Francis' relationship with Bobbi; her relationship with her mother and her father; her relationship with Nick and with Nick's wife, Melissa: each one is dissected and examined perfectly, inviting us into Francis' inner thoughts and laying her feelings completely bare. Francis is wonderfully astute and observant, yet her actions do not represent her level of intelligence and analysis. She is so guarded and crippled by pressure that she finds it difficult to express herself in situations that demand emotional engagement or reaction. Her inner monologues are painstakingly honest and emotive and, when they result in the harmful treatment of herself, are quite unsettling. The remaining three characters are also wonderfully evoked, and the dynamic between them and Francis makes for thrilling reading.Normal People overshadows this novel slightly for me but I still found Conversations With Friends to be a subtly powerful and brilliant novel about a young girl who is both gifted and self-destructive. 4.5 stars, rounded up."

Dešavanja koja često nisu ni toliko interesantna da bi ih ikome prepričali.Iako je ispričan iz prvog lica 21-godišnje Frances i brzo postao ""glas nove generacije"", nije roman samo za tu ciljnu grupu. Drugarice (povremeno i više) Frances i Bobbi doduše gledaju Netflix, dele slušalice za istovremeno slušanje muzike i četuju, ali nisu tipične milenijalke. Bave se pisanjem i javnim čitanjem (!) poezije, gledaju Hitchkockove filmove, slušaju Francois Hardy, jedu humus i pišu dugačke lične mejlove. Ne bi trebalo upoznavati novu generaciju prema njihovom kalupu. Razgovori u Razgovorima sastoje se od usmenih konverzacija, ali i gomile mejlova, telefonskih razgovora i prepisa četova. Jednostavni su i direktni, u stilu ""ona je rekla, on je rekao"", kao i ceo roman, nema tu mnogo poetike i umiranja u stilu (""Imali smo seks. Bilo je lepo. Posle smo ležali.""). Ali opet, sve je to dosta uverljivo. Sasvim realni likovi, sa svojim pogrešnim odlukama i odnosima koje zasnivaju i kad znaju da im to u tom trenutku nije potrebno. Kad biram knjigu, pročitam često par redova dijaloga. Koliko su razgovori stereotipni? Da li su uverljivi?

Even if true, this is an illegitimate basis for criticizing a book. There's so much human drama to be found in the quotidian, and Rooney--a twenty-seven year old--packs a lot in. The author and the characters are clearly imbued with considerable intelligence, and the story is not formulaic in the least. Appropriately enough, given the title, the book is at its best when it treats us to dialogues (especially Bobbi dispatching intellectually mismatched male adversaries with ease) and monologues/diatribes. This book/author might not be for everyone--you might try action movies, if you're looking for lots of explosive pivots--but I'm going to reserve her next title immediately!"

thank god i read normal people first or I wouldn’t have been able to like that book in the least in comparison to this amazing piece of literature that’s conversations with friends. Can’t wrap my head around the fact that this is a debut novel, it just goes to show how remarkable sally rooney is as a relatively young female author. this book felt really personal to me for more reasons than one. probably because i could relate to almost every aspect of it. It made me feel seen, heard, understood and validated for all the experiences I have had so far as a young woman in my 20’s for which i’m eternally grateful to miss sally rooney and her incredible cast of characters. writing this review, so I could go back to it in future and remind myself of all the things i appreciated about this book. the story is narrated by frances, a 21 year old college student who alongside her best friend and ex girlfriend bobbi gets entangled in the lives of nick and melissa. eventually all four of the characters end up creating their own personal relationships with each other and the one that we get to explore in detail is between frances & nick and Frances & Bobbi.

”I didn’t know you were going through all that, I said. Everyone’s always going through something, aren’t they? That’s life, basically, it’s just more and more things to go through.”

putting this quote here because this captures exactly how it felt like reading this book, it felt like going on this journey of experiencing a magnitude of emotions and events that Frances got to live through. her failures and shortcomings felt personal, her disappointments and anger felt relatable, her love and her sorrows felt like my very own. going into this book I didn’t know I’d get to learn so much about myself and that in the most unfiltered way possible. At times I felt like it wasn’t Frances who was being called out for her actions but me.  themes that i particularly related to the most were of TW: self harm, growing up with an emotionally abusive parent and the lasting impact it has on one later in life, being diagnosed with a chronic disease and coming to terms with it, this one in particular, just hit me straight in the gut cause the way sally Rooney wrote the whole scene where Frances gets diagnosed with endometriosis and all the emotions she goes through during and after her diagnosis were just too real to not be felt specially for someone as myself who has found herself in a similar position of going to multiple doctors’s appointment’s for something that was happening to my body and I had no idea about and then finally getting to put a name to it and the anxiety and distress that followed up afterwards, just the whole experience of being told that there might be something wrong with you that you have no control over specially as a young woman in your 20’s and how it changes one’s entire perspective on how they view themselves and the decisions that they make afterwards having to keep that one thing in their minds at all times… just the whole ordeal. It hit too close to home.

”Bobbi and I always shared a contempt for the cultish pursuit of male physical dominance. Even recently we had been asked to leave tesco for reading aloud inane passages from men’s magazines on the shop floor.”

the power of female friendship and the absolute chokehold it has us all girlies in specially the ones in their early 20’s is something I loved reading about. We all have a Bobbi in our lives or had one at some point or would love to bump into one at some point in our lives and we all know the importance of having such a person in our lives. I love how Rooney made Frances and Bobbi’s friendship seem so natural and organic in multiple ways from having each other’s backs in random group discussions to being there for each other when all hell lets loose. The kind of friendship that becomes a source of pure comfort and guidance for you even with its ups and downs and the ugly bits of it. I have multiple reasons of loving Frances as the narrator of this story one of the many being her constant search for external validation to the point where she based her self worth on it because that is something I feel like everyone gets to go through at some point in their lives and luckily for me that time just recently passed so it was weirdly fun reading about it. Alongside that, her persona in general and her outward demeanor is yet another one of the things I found very relatable. What I’m trying to say is I saw a lot of myself in her which was oddly comforting. I mean who doesn’t love a character they could relate to and I feel like anyone who reads this book will find some instances where they would find themselves thinking that if it was them put into that particular setting they would have done or said the same thing. 

”when Bobbi talked about me it felt like seeing myself in a mirror for the first time. I also looked in actual mirror more often. I started taking a close interest in my face and body, which I’d never done before.”

I’m not the biggest of fans of reading about extra marital affairs cause I personally despise the concept or existence of such relationships but shockingly enough that was something I saw myself rooting for in this book. Frances and nick’s relationship having its own complications was still something that I thoroughly enjoyed. It was quite something getting to explore so many characteristics of their relationship that I have experienced in real life in my own relationships with men be it in a platonic/flirtatious way or in the straight up romantic sense. I absolutely adored the banter between them. The constant back and forth was super cute to say the least. The famous princess Diana quote applies to their relationship that ”it was a bit crowded with the three of us in it” with the obvious third person being nick’s wife Melissa. I absolutely loved how Rooney was able to put across both Frances and Melissa’s POV on the relationship b/w nick and Frances without portraying either of them as the evil other woman or the absent wife. It really makes one feel for both the women involved and sympathize with both of them. 

”I loved when he was available to me like this, when our relationship was like a Word document which we were writing and editing together, or a long private joke which nobody else could understand. I liked to feel that he was my collaborator.”

All in all 
Sally Rooney
 really won my heart with this one and I can safely say that this book is definitely one of my all time favorite reads now."
172,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134482683-jess,Rating 4 out of 5,"""you are sick and you're married and you might be dying but you're holding me like water in your hands""moon song by Phoebe BridgersI only found out about this book last year, and went into it without any knowledge of how big Sally Rooney was and how much hyped her books were. Yes, I live in a cave! Now, I’ve read all of her books in the form of buddy read with my best friend, which was an incredible experience since we got to discussed things people don’t usually bring up in conversation; because of this I feel like I love them more than I would’ve had reading it on my own.Sally Rooney’s prose is so matter-of-fact that is painful to read most of the time, her characters are highly unlikable and there is no genuine plot in her stories, so why are so many people (myself included) drawn to it?Well, I can only assume that is because we’re all highly unlikable and our lives have no clear path whatsoever and we’re just trying to get by. According to the main character of this book life is ""the distracting tasks undertaken while the thing you are waiting for continues not to happen.""The novel revolves around Frances and less-so around her friend/exgirlfriend Bobbi and this couple they meet at a poetry read, Melissa and Nick. The dynamics between these four main characters is uncomfortable to read, which makes the book uncomfortable too since it’s all about these people interacting with each other. Throughout the book, and I dare to say, throughout every Sally Rooney book the same issues are discussed, which makes them a vessel for Rooney to pour down her every thought on current events, ideologies and such. Identity.Frances is told she doesn’t have a real personality. This comes from Bobbi, her best and only friend. She is told she doesn’t have feelings. This, from Nick, her only real love interest since she broke up with Bobbi. So, who is Frances, does she actually has no personality, no feelings, if the people who know her better than anyone else don’t think she does? She comforts herself by saying ""I was a very autonomous and independent person with an inner life that nobody else had ever touched or perceived"" because she needs to feel protected from these people, they never really know her. No matter how they judge her, it’s not true because they don’t know her true self.Bobbi is like a God to her (personality cult much?) because she is so much better than her, and probably secretly believes that by spending time with her, she will eventually become Bobbi ""I liked to imagine that I looked like Bobbi. The pretense was so real to me that when I accidentally caught sight of my reflection and saw my own appearance, I felt a strange, depersonalizing shock.""Relationships. We don’t get to know much of the relationships between the characters when Frances is not around which is a shame, because I found them really interesting and the way they were portrayed wasn’t completely reliable since we were depending on Frances to tell us about them. However every interaction that involves Frances is passive-aggressive since, she herself is like that. She never says what she really means and ends up resenting everyone for not noticing the signs. She appears to be distant and cold, contempt about everything because she doesn’t want to get hurt, she feels being vulnerable is a sign of weakness and that’s the worst thing she could be, but she is still extremely co-dependent and measures her self-worth by how much attention they pay her. Queer Representation.I read somewhere that Sally Rooney wrote 'straight people in a queer world'. I think that is so wrong. Yes, maybe the main love interest in this novel is male, but Frances is bisexual, just because in the time frame of the book she is in love with a man doesn’t mean she is straight. I personally found it refreshing to see queer characters having a life outside the 'struggles of being queer'. It’s not that I think books about queer struggle are not important, they are, immensely important, but I love that out of all the things Frances questions about her life (which are a LOT) her sexuality is not one of them.Communism.""Bobbi thinks depression is a humane response to the conditions of late capitalism.""Probably the most recurrent out of all the recurrent topics in the Rooneyverse and the one that really gets on my nerves.Frances is a communist. Nick says he considers himself one too, and he doesn’t want to be called out for owning a house. What does that mean, for an enabled, privileged person to be a communist? When I read this with my friend, we discussed whether this was actually a criticism for communism since the characters seemed to be hypocrites about it.Frances is marveled at Melissa and Nick’s house and all the fancy things they own, she doesn’t want to work and lives out of her parents money. Snide remarks about the rich, and unequal wealth are made throughout the book, with the characters opposing it, but still enjoying being on the 'fun' side of things.During a conversation with Bobbi she says she resents to be told what to do, and Bobbi says that’s her communist intuition. Do they even know what communism means? Like I said, I thought it was a critic, but then I read Sally Rooney was a Marxist so now I’m just confused.I live in a communist country that feels like a Kafkaesque/Orwellian hell, so no, Bobbi, depression is not just a response to the conditions of late capitalism. No, Frances, being opposed to authority figures is not communist intuition, in fact if you find something conflicting you have to shut up and bite your tongue. I would actually love to see these characters unwind in a real communist setting and not the fantasy land they think it is.Bottom line this is a really polarizing book, you’re going to love it or hate it, and I think it’s hard to remain indifferent. I’m glad I read this without any expectations, unaware of how hyped it was, otherwise I probably would have taken all the things that didn’t do it for me in the wrong way."

I was a very autonomous and independent person with an inner life that nobody else had ever touched or perceived.I don’t know how you can’t love Frances, at least a little. Her inability to be vulnerable or weak is heartbreaking, even if a lot of the plot in the book is driven by the whole affair with a married man thing. But it’s hard not to be sympathetic when it comes to her health and relationship with her father. For an articulate person, she’s not great at voicing anything that is impacting her on a personal level. People were always wanting me to show some weakness so they could reassure me. It made them feel worthy, I knew all about that.I also found her relationship dynamic with Bobbi so fascinating. They are such different characters but the fact that they always gravitate towards each other feels organic. While Bobbi is unabashedly herself and comfortable with her feelings, they still sort of need each other as a mirror/means to understand themselves better. "
174,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/138953644-p,Rating 4 out of 5,"‘Conversations with Friends’ by sally rooney is possibly one of the most detailed and raw book I’ve ever read. Admittedly, I kept putting this book off because I’m a moody reader and thought i wasn’t really going to like this, but I ended up enjoying this! In here, we follow our main character, Frances, as she deals with her own definite life problems. This book was written in first-person pov and despite Frances being unbearably insufferable sometimes, she was a realistic and relatable character. We could see throughout each chapter how she refuses & declines to show anyone her emotional vulnerability—I resonate to this so much and it made me feel so understood as a person 😭 I just love how this book touched on sensitive subject circumstances, but with such accuracy and delicacy that it was never too overwhelming. It certainly wasn’t an easy read at some parts, but it was freshening to read and analyze characters that are dealing with these very real matters, while also trying to balance everyday life."

**2.5 stars**“I realised my life would be full of mundane physical suffering, and that there was nothing special about it. Suffering wouldn't make me special, and pretending not to suffer wouldn't make me special. Talking about it, or even writing about it, would not transform the suffering into something useful.”
My first encounter with Sally Rooney was with Normal People. Now that one had garnered a whole lot of ambiguity as well, but I was on the positive side of it. Especially the raw and realistic way in which Marianne and Connell’s lives were portrayed, along with a touch of stream-of-consciousness stylization; that was something YA novels that I’ve ever come across feature very rarely. So when I went into Conversations with Friends, knowing that it deals with the lives of 4 different personalities and how their physical and psychological lives intertwine with each other, I had my expectations sky-high. I was hoping to get to know the subject of infidelity from a unique perspective. Now, it may be obvious from my rating, but let’s get that out, I didn’t like this one. I’m severely disappointed.The premise was pretty simple, as is expected with Sally Rooney. And there are several aspects to it that I adored, like the lucid and introspective storytelling. It’s kind of like Murakami, whether you like the particular story you’re reading by him or not, it’s not quite easy to throw away the copy saying you’re done and you can’t take any more of that stuff. That of course indirectly adds to the credibility, but of course, you’ve to suffer the detriments of continuing with your reading.
“Everyone’s always going through something, aren’t they? That’s life, basically. It’s just more and more things to go through.”
Now maybe it’s my fault, but I am quite uncertain now of whether it’s solely my fault that I didn’t like it. Firstly, when you hear that a story deals with homosexuality and bisexuality, you go in there wanting to read something about them, other than the fact that one character proclaims at the beginning of a story that she’s gay, and another that she’s bisexual. Okay, I know that a story can be of a person with any sexual orientation at all and not be about relationships (concerning and relevant to the orientation). But that works as long as the story doesn’t deal with relationships ONLY. You understand where I’m getting right? Also, the story feels ridiculously incomplete, so much so that I felt that I was reading a short story or the first half of a novella. It’s not like the ending is left out for interpretation or something like that, but somehow from the mid-point, the plot doesn’t unfold anymore but remains tiresomely static.There are elements to the story that simply exist but don’t evolve into anything else, it’s fine with one or two such things, but after a time you start asking ‘What’s the freaking point of telling us that if you don’t know where or how it is going?’And then there’s an ample dose of pseudo-intellectuality, chiefly through the voices of Bobbi and sometimes Frances (also). A huge drawback is when Frances says that Bobbi addresses psychiatric disorders as a consequence of capitalism (and not as a metaphor). 
""Out loud I said: Bobbi thinks depression is a humane response to the conditions of late capitalism.""
Yeah it's actually questionable, and specifically relating to the topic of capitalism in this story, I read a quite opinionated article online. However, a story can be all about unlikeable characters and still be likeable, but only as long as you feel a certain degree of resonance to it. Were Marianne and Connell not flawed? But at least to me, their story never felt pretentious or superficial, like, they weren’t doing those to prove a point, and whenever they hurt one another, they were most of the time victims of the circumstances. That’s never the case here. But even if we adjust to that ostentatious approach, say of the relationship between Nick and Frances, it lacks sufficient purpose. (For those who watch Indian movies, let’s cite two recent movies from the same genre: dysfunctional families. Dil Dhadakne Do and Kapoor & Sons. Kapoor & Sons have flawed characters, but I can relate to them, while in Dil Dhadakne Do, though I find certain bits of relevance, at the end of the day it all feels superficial and pretentious.)Well, I will still read  Beautiful World, Where Are You? and all future books she will pen down. My dislike for this one is far overpowered by my love for Normal People. Again, I don’t think this one is extremely bad. It’s just a waste of potential. Kinda felt like a mid version of The Worst Person in The World, but that’s all.
“You can love more than one person, she said. That's arguable. Why is it any different from having more than one friend? You're friends with me and you also have other friends, does that mean you don't really value me? I don't have other friends, I said.”

180,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843912-switterbug-betsey,Rating 5 out of 5,"What a surprise sleeper! Irish author Sally Rooney has written a thoroughly engaging, literary, but highly accessible contemporary novel about friends and acquaintances that installed me by the first page, and kept enticing me further into the narrator, Frances’s, head and heart until the bittersweet end. Unsentimental, unsparing, and droll, laced with a dash of mordant wit, the questionably reliable narrator is yet full of candid observations and uninhibited confession. Her insights into human nature are spot-on and shot through with barefaced shame and naked disclosures. But, with all her exterior cool, ironic flair, she won't admit to being self-destructive.Written in a journaling style, the lack of quotations aren’t pretentious or flippant—they are necessary to retain the personal intimacy, but easy to parse. You never question who is speaking; you only wonder how reliable, at times, is the veracity of her perception of events. But, when we chronicle our own stories, there’s always the dangling issue of the subjective. But Frances, in her choice of words and openness, is quite convincing and persuasive. When Frances engages in an illicit affair, her judgment and alliance to the facts could be jettisoned by her point of view. Or these are the questions that I found myself asking. The absence of quotation marks are fitting to remind the reader that Frances is at the center of her story, and what is de facto spoken by her and others is less important than the struggle and the consequences.Bobbi and Frances met in a posh middle school. Both are artists—Frances a poet, and Bobbi a performer of dramatic monologues and anti-war ballads. They perform Frances’s poetry at spoken word events. By day, Frances is working as an unpaid intern at a literary agency, with no firm plans for the future. Bobbi, a super wealthy trust fund baby, is considered the charismatic and beautiful one, always looking for a cause, but seriously political and sincere with her Leftist principles. They meet married photographer and writer Melissa at an event, and after a bonding night out, Melissa asks to do a feature article on them, and they agree. Eventually, this leads to an affair between Frances and Nick.Bobbi and Frances were lovers in high school, but have remained best friends since breaking up after a year. Frances realizes that Bobbi is prone to narcissism, and accepts this as part of her charm. Frances’s journal entries, laced with irony, bring the reader closer to her, because she often reveals more in her words said insouciantly than she intends. She’ll often make a casual remark that unintentionally stings, and imparts pathos. “If we were both going to die in a burning building and he could only save one of us, wouldn’t he certainly save Melissa and not me? It seemed practically evil to have so much sex with someone who you would later allow to burn to death.”I can imagine readers intensely hating all the characters, but I possess a soft spot for difficult characters that may be hard to like but are immediately and recognizably human. The story is a triangulating affair but in four-square mode, and so much is observation and reflection that it makes the almost clichéd plot (in lesser hands) appear original. It isn’t what actually happens that is so unique—affairs and messy marriages have been going on in life and in literature since time itself. Rather, the excitement is in Frances’s writing--her mixture of emotional and analytical surveillance and infinitesimal scrutiny of her situation and of those involved. But within her candid audit, did she lose herself or find herself? The finale, as it were, is not revealed until the very last sentence. And, even then, it is written organically, in that nothing ends at the end of a novel, but is only a stopping point for the rest of life to continue, and to provoke the reader into thought and discussion of what comes next. CONVERSATIONS WITH FRIENDS will undoubtedly make my top ten this year."

Prijatelji imaju ono što mi je nedostajalo u Ljudima – širenje vidika bez žrtvovanja introspektivnog fokusa. Ponovo je tu (iako joj je ovaj roman prvenac, moja interna hronologija je išla obrnuto, tako da da, PONOVO) savršeno prikazani život 20-i-kusur godina starih mladih i ludih i sasvim običnih „prijatelja“ ovde u fokusu – Runijeva ima fascinantno banalan, potpuno autentičan glas kada je reč o, uh (uh), nama. Ali, kao što Tijana reče, biće da to nije samo stvar „nas“ već i svih „nas“ koji su se ikada našli u sličnoj beznadežnoj situaciji kasne mladosti i rane zrelosti. Ono što je možda karakterističnije za nove generacije ovde je i ono što se periodično probije u prvi plan; opresija kapitalizma; naivni idealizam anarhizma; potraga za posebnošću, jedinstvenošću, nekim drugim, boljim svetom. No naravno, to je tek povremena distrakcija od onoga što je zapravo u Ljudima suština – večna potera za intimnošću koju tako često okarakterišemo kao sreću, kao i komplementarno saplitanje o svoje fantomske udove novopečenih odnosa.I to mi je ovde leglo definitivno više nego u Normalnim ljudima – dok su u Ljudima protagonisti obični, ali sasvim sigurno i „slučajevi“, u Prijateljima protagonisti su samo to – obični. Iako sam Normalne ljude okarakterisao kao ipak suviše običnim da bi bili i jedinstveni, ovde je slučaj, paradoksalno, ipak takav da iako su Prijatelji običniji, nekako su zbog toga i posebniji.Jedino što moram da primetim, i što mi već sad malo bode oči, jeste da Sali Runi, kao i mnogi njoj slični pisci, u mnogome ponavlja teme o kojima piše iz romana u roman. Ovde je to nekako osetnije nego što je to npr slučaj kod (uvek reprezentativni primer ""nije šija nego vrat"" karakteristike kod pisaca) Murakamija, kako zbog tematike, tako zbog ogoljenosti stila. Voleo bih da vidim Runijevu sa nekim drugim, za nju svežijim temama - svakako ću obratiti pažnju na njene buduće naslove.5-"

Eu realmente acredito que a autora é uma das autoras mais fascinantes da atualidade, não por ter uma escrita óbvia, mas pelo brilhantismo escondido nas entrelinhas e pela habilidade dela em escrever situações mundanas de forma tão viva, crua e, em partes, tão sensível. Ainda não consegui definir muito bem, pra mim, o que faz os livros da autora tão profundos e pungentes. O que, talvez, torne as histórias escritas pela autora tão especiais seja a atenção prestada à absoluta beleza das coisas mundanas. Andar a rua, tomar um chá, olhar pra tela do computador apagada, olhar para pessoas e imaginá-las como parte de um grande e complexo sistema que se interliga de formas diferentes. Não sei. Espero, um dia, descobrir os encantos e os porquês os livros dela me fascinam de forma tão pessoal e, por vezes, tão ilógica.1° leituraEu gostei bastante desse livro, quando comecei lê-lo eu não esperava me envolver com os personagens da forma que me envolvi. Quando comecei essa história eu estava esperando algo semelhante a ""Normal People"", que foi um livro que eu não gostei tanto.A escrita da autora é muito rápida e boa pra ler, os diálogos desse livro são inteligentes e perspicazes, os personagens são formados por camadas e camadas de uma personalidade bem escrita e trabalhada. Sally escreve sobre pessoas imperfeitas, sobre a experiência humana na tomada de decisões importantes e sobre como nossas escolhas irracionais afetam as pessoas ao nosso redor e, consequentemente, como isso contribui para que o leitor possa enxergar o que significa ser humano.

I loved this book perhaps too much in the way that only a few books come to make me feel. I can write a paragraph on 'Frances is basically me'. If the song Illicit Affairs by Taylor Swift was a book.Conversations with friends follows Frances and her ex-girlfriend Bobbi as they get involved with an older married couple and we see their relationship dynamics as it evolves into a messy and complex situation as Frances gets into an affair with the husband and Bobbi who really idolizes the wife. Not very plot-heavy and not many major events happen, we just follow these people throughout a year. I was so invested in this book and all the characters felt so real. A common critic I've seen in Sally Rooney's books, in general, is that you can't sympathize with the characters and find them frustrating and I agree that all these characters are low-key bad people but in a way that everyone is bad and like real people are certainly flawed. Frances' dialogues can feel a bit abrasive towards others but deep down she has her own struggles, that just hit me.I've said this with every Sally Rooney book and I'll say it again, I love her writing. She writes broken and flawed characters so beautifully with so much realness to them. Also, I loved how she weaves political views in her books.This was my favorite Sally Rooney book. Such a fucking banger, loved everything about it.Lastly can't wait for the TV series adaptation, I can totally see Joe Alwyn playing Nick and the characters were cast perfectly as well, they knew what they were doing!"

She writes about relationships that are mundane, human & relatable, but also keeps you entertained, engaged & sometimes shocked. She is a model to me of how to write modern conversation in an approachable way & I admire it greatly. This book was the first she ever released & I loved it nearly as much as I did her ever so popular “Normal People.” Was that Marianne appearing in this one as well by the way? I believe it was, but I couldn’t find a definitive answer online. She was only in the story sparingly, anyway..On another note, this book in particular captured a feeling I felt often in my younger relationships. “I still have that impulse to be available to you” I can’t explain how many times I felt that way! How painful yet second nature it was to me to just exist hoping the person I truly wanted would choose to want me back eventually & if the time came, I would be ready. Nick & Frances displayed that relationship beautifully. Obviously, ethics aside, their time together was entirely confusing, but that is human nature in my opinion. Nick’s desperation for feeling lovable, Frances’ ability to make him feel good about himself & give him more meaning than his marriage did… It was honest..I loved Bobbi so much. Everything about her challenging & articulate self! I found Melissa annoying in many ways, but mostly because I couldn’t figure out why she was taking such an interest in these younger women in a way that was not healthy? It just felt odd to me, but I think that’s how Sally meant the reader to feel. Anyway! This story & all its characters were wonderful. Frances’ parents really developed her personality & gave reasoning to her inability to speak about her mental health struggles. The endometriosis inclusion was appreciated & I’m sure helped many people feel seen. There were just so many good parts!! The strange vacation, the couples dinner during the affair… So in your face & challenging of our traditional view of relationships. Obviously I adored it!!! "

I had a love-hate relationship with Normal People, so I had no idea how I would feel about this one.""I had the sense that something in my life had ended, my image of myself as a whole or normal person maybe. I realised my life would be full of mundane physical suffering, and that there was nothing special about it. Suffering wouldn’t make me special, and pretending not to suffer wouldn’t make me special. Talking about it, or even writing about it, would not transform the suffering into something useful. Nothing would.""Conversations with Friends is the 2017 debut novel by Sally Rooney that offers a realistic and sharp portrayal of adultery and human intimacy in unconventional and modern relationships, as well as the complexities and challenges that follow from sexual desire through the Lens of Frances, an introverted 21-year-old poet and college student, who has a poorly developed sense of self and struggles to connect with people. The story begins with the first conversation she and her ex-girlfriend/current best friend Bobbi have with a seemingly perfect married couple, Melissa and Nick who they meet at an open mic night in Dublin, and advances through the different stages of a complicated and messy relationship that develops between the four of them.Let me start by saying that Sally Rooney's books are definitely not for everyone. They're very character-driven stories and deal with the elusive nature of relationships between characters rather than focusing heavily on the plot; therefore, some readers might find it monotonous but I like her unique writing style and dialogue. There is something in the reality of the characters she writes about and the issues they face that is both thrilling and repulsive. I'm afraid I can't say the same thing about the mood and atmosphere within which the narrative takes place. The setting doesn't really give readers a vivid sense of place, nor does it play a big part in the way of storytelling as the novel lacks descriptive scenery and substantially focuses on interpersonal dynamics and the effect the characters have on each other. In other words, the novel concentrates more on the aspects that pertain to political and ideological elements of social context by means of which Sally Rooney addresses her personal and political views and provides commentary on society through her characters. One surprising fact about her writing style is that she doesn't use quotation marks. At first, it's a bit confusing but after reading the first few chapters, you'll get accustomed to it and it'll become easier to identify the speech. While CWF presents an interesting take on polygamous marriage and infidelity, it also adeptly depicts menstrual problems, alexithymia, alcohol abuse, mental illness, self-loathing, and self-destruction. Controversial and debatable as these topics are, from the very beginning Sally Rooney dispels the instinct of immediately judging and deploring the characters' actions in an oblique and subtle way and captures one's sense of alienation and isolation within friendships/relationships and the struggle to articulate and communicate effectively, all the while trying to satisfy the primal need for love and affection in her writing in a very relatable way.The ending is somewhat ambiguous, but unlike some people who may find it frustrating, I like books without clear conclusions that allow readers to imagine and interpret the story personally."

Gradually the waiting began feel less like waiting and more like this was simply what life was: the distracting tasks undertaken while the thing you are waiting for continues not to happen.

2.5 stars.Sally Rooney really writes people well. She writes them so real and raw it's sometimes painful. Sometimes it feels like you're looking at a mirror, other times you see someone you know, but you never think they're unreal. The dialogue is sharp and basically everyone kind of sucks but they also are so human that they kind of don't? It's frustrating but it's also real. It's hard to explain but that's how it feels.This book, much like Rooney's more famous novel Normal People is definitely not plot-heavy. At all. Instead it's very much character-driven. And, as established above, they're not such great characters necessarily. And yet, somehow, somehow I finished this whole book. I just ... I don't know how I read the whole thing. At no point did I even consider dnfing, but when I finished I was left with this hollow feeling of well, okay (but not in a good way). I didn't hate the experience, I just didn't love the story as a whole. Does that make sense? I don't think I'd ever reread this book, but I appreciated the ride while I was reading it.My biggest issue with this book is that we barely see any growth or change. Nothing is solved, nothing makes sense, and yes I get that that's life but also I don't know how I feel reading a whole book where almost nothing happens or changes. Even when you think change is about to happen, you're proven wrong. The people drive you mad with their decisions (or lack thereof). Again, life, I get it, but it's painful to read. I guess that's sort of the point. I'll say it again from my Normal People review, Sally Rooney really and truly is an incredible writer though. I keep picking these books of hers up sometimes even knowing the story isn't one I'd normally enjoy and yet I can't put it down once I start. There's something painfully real and familiar about her words, her characters, her stories, that keep you engaged, unable to look away, not unlike a car crash. Sometimes it hurts like one too. I'm still holding out for that book of hers that I know I'll love. In the meantime, I'll keep leaving confused reviews on the ones I read along the way."
194,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81432722-olivia,Rating 5 out of 5,"2nd review-----------------------------My first review is still spot on. I wish I could use my words the way Sally Rooney does. I was blown away when I first read this, and I really can’t believe I am even more speechless the second time around. I found myself feeling a lot more empathetic towards Bobbi on this second read. I loved reading through all my previous annotations and seeing how my perspective has changed. The strength of this complex psychological profile was even more apparent to me this time. Frances is unreliable and the single point of view makes this such an interesting read, especially once you realize how she sees herself is completely different to how others do. I still feel an unsettling connection with Frances. I love how messy and complex all these characters feel. I really paid attention to how social structures impacted the various interpersonal relationships. This is something SR loves to play around with, and I didn’t catch on to this much on my first read. I feel like this is a book I’ll appreciate more every time I read it. I will never stop recommending this one! TW: self harm, infidelity, sexual content, depression, suicidal thoughts, medical trauma/endometriosis, toxic friendship1st review------------------------------This book was addictive and painful to read, but it capture my soul entirely.What sticks with me the most from this book is how perfectly Sally Rooney captures the 'messy edges' of female friendship (the back of the book describes it this way and I think it's absolutely perfect). France's relationship with Bobbi was so frustrating to read. I found myself reminiscing back to a friendship that I had which made me feel just as empty and lost. It's a kind of friendship where jumping between loving and loathing creates a space devoid of trust. France is an unreliable narrator, and our impression of Bobbi is a direct byproduct of Frances zooming in on aspects that upload her hatred. Reading Frances' inner monologue was like holding up a mirror to myself and exposing all the things I hate. Her narrative was disturbing and at times felt way too personal. Frances lacks agency and is governed by her anxiety which others misinterpret as a mysterious character. What results are messy and disconnected relationships that play out in a way that feels all too real and familiar."
195,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31122957-mohammed-al-thani,Rating 4 out of 5,"Sally Rooney's Conversations with Friends explores the dynamics on how a person's low self-esteem can impact a polyamorous relationship. The book title makes it very clear that it's not one who seeks a plot but rather heavily driven by dialogue. Having read Rooney's Normal People and acclaiming it as one of my favourite contemporary novels of all time, I was very excited to see how conversations with friends would ‘converse’ with me. I'm happy to announce that there was no miscommunication because I absolutely loved this debut novel. It's almost rare that I read two books by the same author within a short period, but I guess Rooney's raw and real character-driven stories are my thing. Unlike Normal People, where Rooney digresses between the main characters, in here, we're stuck in our main characters head, Frances. I would consider this novel to be a coming of age one rather than a love story. Or is it...? The complexity and dynamics between friendships and relationships explored throughout this book were absolutely brilliant, well-executed and oh so very real. It plays with questions that seem simple on the surface but are rather complex when you come to think of it. Because really, what is a friend? And what is a conversation? Speaking about conversation, Rooney use of ‘conversations’ are seen played out cleverly through the many forms of communication: word of mouth, subconscious/unconscious, eye to eye, emails etc. The way Rooney is able to capturing the sense of alienation was truly a raw form of art. Thanks to her exquisite yet lyrical and lucid writing style, she was able to capture one of the most real mental states I have ever read. Although I kind of wanted more of a literal gut punch and events to occur from this novel, Rooney’s debut novel on modern relationships makes her an author to watch out for. We might have an upcoming literary queen. "
196,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68282340-danny-chen,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is like reading a coming-of-age story - with no coming of age. Instead, we are forced to endure the insufferable whims and tantrums of an angsty college student, as she displays complete social ineptitude and an uncanny ability to destroy all the relationships around her. Unfortunately, it doesn't end there: this is a vapid story with vapid characters, one without structure, a resolution and any semblance of a meaningful message. What amazes me is how well Sally Rooney crafted such entirely unbelievable and narcissistic characters. Be it Frances - who adopts a holier-than-thou attitude to everything (until something doesn't go her way and she is reduced to throwing tantrums like a petulant child), Bobbi (pretentious, self-righteous intellect who spends the entire novel pontificating to her hapless victims) or Nick (passive, questionable sense of morals and lacks any personality), I struggled to connect on any level with them. Don't you enjoy discussing the fetishisation of 'untouched nature' being intrinsically patriarchal and nationalistic? Overall, this was a terrible literary experience, one that felt completely out of touch with reality, and I'm glad these kind of humans don't exist in the real world (a sobering thought is that there are people like this who exist). Save these precious hours of your life and find something else to read instead, I beg you."

Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but I just love little discoveries like these. I also took a whole bunch of cultural notes, so excuse me if I'm busy for a while.Damn all these covers! This is *not* YA or feel-good lit.(2019)------------Dear Sally,Just wanted you to know that stars over here in Goodreadsland are complete BS. I mean, how can you tell the difference between really liking something and loving it? Bobbi and Frances could have a conversation on that topic, if you ask me. Whatever. I kind of really liked to almost loved your book, if you know what I mean. I cannot pinpoint exactly what is it that really drew me to the book; apart from huge anticipation and some fear of disappointment on my side, it could be the direct, honest writing, or the overly smart people and their conversations, their vulnerabilities and complicated lives."

I didn’t like any of the characters, not much happens with the plot, it goes along at a steady pace, yet I was hooked with the story. The writing grabs me and makes the reading experience enjoyable. It’s not perfect, yet not that far off and I will read anything Sally Rooney puts out. Side note: they’ve done a wonderful job with the tv show.———January 2020:Was hesitant going into this one because “Normal People” was so good, but honestly this story was addictive even though most of the characters were not likeable hahah, I only semi sympathised with Frances every now and then.

Not that my American GR-friends would shut out Irish writers while shouting America first but could it be that the writing and psyche of this novel is so unamerican, so damn honest and candid in a naked, embarrasing kind of way that it was too alien for some? I am not really sure. All I know is that the gap -between one layer of how you present yourself to the world/your friends and the second layer of how you really feel/how awfully uncertain someone's core self-image is, well that this gap was scarcely that wide and unbridgeable in other novels. What made it really unique was the constant presence of these two layers and how they interacted in the main character's projection to the outside world and her own inner universe."

I can't exactly pinpoint what it is, maybe her wonderful and unique prose, or just the fact that she describes realistic and flawed characters like only few others can. For many reasons I wouldn't say the characters of this book are relatable, but for many others they so are. They reveal some harsh truths, hidden in this kind of stream of consciousness that they always seem to be in the middle of. I've now read everything Sally Rooney has put out into this world and I can say with a fair amount of certainty that she's definitely an author I will always come back to. I'm really looking forward to her next project."

207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69926492-domenico-fina,Rating 4 out of 5,"Se dovessi riassumerlo con una frase direi: Noi siamo quello che non ci aspettiamo di essere e che nemmeno gli altri si aspettano da noi. Traduzione di Maurizia Balmelli. (Titolo originale ""Conversations with friends"", 2017) ""Ai campi preferisco le case, ho detto. Sono più poetiche, perché dentro ci sono le persone"".In questo romanzo non ci sono particolari descrizioni di paesaggi, il paesaggio che interessa Frances, la voce narrante, sono le persone che incontra e in particolare un uomo sposato che si chiama Nick. Immagino che le ambientazioni al chiuso siano una caratteristica piuttosto comune tra le nuove scritture, la natura di una volta passa per case, reading, caffè, chat, presentazioni letterarie, finestre. Per giunta Frances è talmente presa dalle relazioni che non sembra badare al resto. Sally Rooney, come Frances, la protagonista del romanzo, ha frequentato l’università di Dublino e si è distinta per la capacità di gareggiare in competizioni studentesche di spoken word, gare in cui si persuade l’uditorio su un tema di attualità come questioni di genere, rifugiati, situazione politica internazionale, patriarcato, eccetera. Sally Rooney ama Joyce.Queste premesse non sono irrilevanti, vanno tenute in considerazione perché questo romanzo può fare inizialmente l’effetto irritante di “hanno stufato con i casi letterari internazionali di talenti precoci e brillanti che fanno vita creativa e sembrano tutti uguali”. Due amiche studentesse universitarie, Frances e Bobbi incontrano una coppia sposata, Melissa 36enne, lavora nell'editoria, e suo marito Nick, 32enne, attore dal fascino magnetico e svagato. Frances e Bobbi si amano come amiche e per un periodo si sono desiderate fisicamente. Frances inizia a provare un'attrazione smisurata per Nick. Bobbi sembra voler flirtare con Melissa, la moglie di Nick. Nick è ritratto come un uomo di quelli esitanti, che ti stanno dicendo prendila tu l'iniziativa. Frances, ha le opinioni di molte studentesse della sua età, la sua amica le dice che non ha una vera personalità intendendolo come un complimento, Frances prende l’iniziativa, sarà lei a baciare Nick, Frances non ama Yeats, sospetta di coloro che lo amano, ""non puoi essere capace di intimità umana se ti piace Yeats"", avversa il capitalismo; Bobbi, l'amica, dice cose come “la depressione è la risposta umana alle condizioni del capitalismo”, Frances dice cose come “diventerò così intelligente che non mi capirà nessuno”. Nelle email, fra loro, usano il minuscolo dopo il punto. Come è in voga informale, ad ogni età, oggi. Il libro è scritto con precipitazione accorta e non si usano virgolette; per far capire che si tratta di una frase dialogata, si aggiunge un 'ha detto', 'ho detto', come se una ragazza stesse raccontando alla sua amica, 300 pagine della sua vita. Adesso arrivo al punto, abbiate pazienza. L’apparente stato grezzo del testo è deliberato, arrivo a pensare che lo stesso fatto di averlo scritto in tre mesi contribuisca a conferire un apparente scompiglio al romanzo, come una email scritta a un’amica, in cui una ragazza dalla sensibilità acutissima scrive in confidenza tutto quello che le viene in mente, mantenendosi tuttavia in un registro medio, omettendo frasi sguaiate, retoriche e magniloquenti. Non approfondendo alcuni personaggi. I genitori di Frances ad esempio, vengono lasciati sullo sfondo. Sono separati, in crisi economica e il padre è un uomo che beve molto. Tutto ciò conduce quasi fatalmente il lettore, nella prima parte, a voler tirare presto le somme, a cadere nel tranello del giudizio. Tu Sally Rooney mi stai riproponendo il solito cliché appiattito e rilassato di troppa narrativa odierna. Anch’io ci sono caduto in pieno e stavo per abbandonare la lettura. Ma andando avanti, come in un testo di Joyce, con le dovute distanze e con tutte le cautele del caso (per carità), il romanzo si rivela per quello che è. Le frasi che arrivano dall'aria, e che ognuno di noi condivide, in periodi della sua vita, non siamo esattamente noi, cioè siamo un noi sbadato, che ci rappresenta nelle giornate medie, ma quando arrivano le giornate sofferte, nella seconda parte, il lettore viene messo nella stessa condizione della protagonista: tu lettore stai giudicando ma ti sbaglierai. Noi siamo anche e soprattutto quelli della seconda parte del romanzo, quando la vita ci mette alla prova e non sappiamo come vivere. Il risultato della lettura in un romanzo vero è sempre vivificante. La sofferenza di Frances sarà dovuta a un complesso di cose, l’amore per Nick che non chiama amore ma la sofferenza resta, un problema fisico, l’endometriosi, che non chiama col suo nome ma col fatto crudo che prova dolori uterini che la fanno svenire. Sviene in una chiesa in cui era entrata per caso, lei che si professa atea, e ci si rende conto, che 'noi non siamo come nel nostro farneticare' restiamo atei o credenti o quello che si vuole ma torniamo allo stato in cui le cose e i sentimenti sono indefiniti tutte le volte che un romanzo e una vita diventano autentici. E questa ragazza 26enne, irlandese della Contea di Mayo, riesce sorprendentemente a smentire il lettore. Il lato comico e toccante del libro sta in questo, in una minuziosa conversazione ininterrotta tra se stessa e gli altri, comprese le paure di vivere e morire. Fregandosene soavemente di come dovrebbe essere accolto un testo da pubblicare. Seconda parte delle recensione, in cui intendo far capire come è scritto. Lo stile, in definitiva. In questo romanzo estrarre frasi brevi non credo contribuisca a renderne meglio l’idea, anzi come spesso accade nelle impressioni di lettura sbrigative, si inseriscono frasi slogan che finiscono su Twitter e ribalzano senza un perché, come peraltro succede ai protagonisti del romanzo con le loro discussioni.Ho scelto di riportare un’intera pagina perché la scrittura piana di Sally Rooney non si apprezza con poche righe. Frances, ad esempio, nelle prime pagine dice: “Non mi veniva in mente niente di brillante da dire e stentavo a organizzarmi la faccia in un’espressione che comunicasse il mio senso dell’umorismo”. Questo piglio strambo ha fatto invocare perfino Salinger dal suo editore britannico. Sono cose che si dicono e ci possono anche stare ma uno scrittore, così come un calciatore o un fabbro-ferraio, intimamente vogliono che si dica loro, tu sei tu. Quindi eccovi un brano lungo: Frances e l’amica, Bobbi, vengono invitate da Nick e Melissa in una villa al mare, di loro proprietà, in Francia. Ognuno dei protagonisti dorme nella propria stanza. Dopo una delle loro cene in cui, conversando, si eccitano gli animi, Frances sale in camera di Nick. Sanno che potrebbero essere clamorosamente scoperti. Frances approfitta in tutte le maniere per scombinare Nick, lo stordisce di parole, ‘tu non mi sembri coinvolto’, cerca di farlo ridere. Nick ha sofferto di una forma di depressione, ma anche questo aspetto non viene approfondito; per l’ultima volta, lo ripeto, rischiando di diventare noioso come sembra voler apparire superficialmente il romanzo: a Sally Rooney non interessa e non è la sua prerogativa, tratteggiare passato e presente dei personaggi, li dipinge in modo stereotipato, non originale, Frances talvolta si ferisce le dita per punirsi, cose quindi lette e rilette nella narrativa contemporanea media, a Sally Rooney interessa inscenare le loro esitazioni e la vita che li cambia, in questo risiede la forza originale del libro, che non è affatto medio ma un gran libro d’esordio, a mio avviso. ""Ci siamo spogliati senza guardarci. Ho affondato la faccia nel materasso e l’ho sentito toccarmi i capelli. Mi ha passato il braccio intorno e ha detto: vieni un secondo qui. Mi sono tirata su in ginocchio, sentivo il suo torace contro la schiena, e quando ho voltato la testa la sua bocca mi ha sfiorato il bordo dell’orecchio. Frances, non sai quanto ti voglio, ha detto. Ho chiuso gli occhi. Quelle parole sono sembrate andare oltre la mia mente, come se mi fossero entrate dritte in corpo e fossero rimaste lì. Quando ho parlato, la mia voce era bassa e ardente. Se non puoi avermi morirai? Ho chiesto. E lui ha detto: sì. Quando era dentro di me, mi sono sentita come se avessi dimenticato di respirare. Mi teneva la vita con le mani. Continuavo a chiedergli di farlo più forte, anche se poi faceva un po’ male. Lui diceva cose tipo: sei sicura che non fa male? Gli ho detto che volevo che facesse male, ma non lo so se lo volessi davvero. Per tutta risposta Nick ha detto: ok. Dopo un po’ era così bello che mi si è appannata la vista, e non ero sicura di riuscire ad articolare delle frasi compiute. Continuavo a dire ti prego, ti prego, ma non sapevo di cosa lo stessi pregando. Lui mi ha messo un dito sulle labbra come per dirmi di stare zitta e io l’ho preso in bocca, fino a che mi ha toccato il fondo del palato. L’ho sentito dire oh, no, fermati. Ma era già troppo tardi, è venuto. Sudava, e continuava a dire: cazzo, mi dispiace. Io tremavo paurosamente. Avevo l’impressione di non capire quello che stava succedendo tra noi. Fuori aveva ormai cominciato a fare chiaro e dovevo andarmene. Nick si è tirato su e mi ha guardata rimettermi il vestito. Non sapevo cosa dirgli. Ci siamo scambiati un’occhiata disperata e abbiamo distolto lo sguardo. In camera mia al piano di sotto non riuscivo a dormire. Sono rimasta seduta sul letto con le ginocchia strette al petto a guardare la luce che filtrava dalla fessura delle imposte. Alla fine ho aperto la finestra e mi sono affacciata sul mare. Era l’alba, e il cielo di un azzurro argentato era perfetto. Sentivo Nick camminare nella stanza sopra di me. Se chiudevo gli occhi avevo la sensazione che fosse vicinissimo, tanto vicino da sentirlo respirare. Sono rimasta alla finestra così finché ho sentito delle porte aprirsi al piano di sopra, e il cane abbaiare, e la macchina del caffè accendersi per la colazione."""

This is what I crave to read about in romances. The details to tiny observations. This is what’s so profound about the author’s writing. She notices everything.Like the emphasis put on how people act around the people they like - beyond aware that they’re scrutinizing you so you make sure your facial expressions are correlating to what you want to send over, or even overthinking how you stand, etc. Or rolling over everything they said in your mind so you won't forget.“These were long and intense conversations, and felt so momentous to me that I secretly transcribed parts of them from memory in the evenings.”I was, however, hesitant to pick this up because I cannot stand cheating storylines. But the self-loathing and destructive ways of the main character made me see this not as a true relationship but just another path to erase herself. I think the ultimate true love story is the one she has with her best friend, Bobbi, who knows her true and through.But do I get the appeal of Nick? Definitely, same with Ivan in The Idiot, I understood the appeal of this older aloof guy, but simultaneously, I was like this dude needs to leave her alone. She needs therapy, not him. I just felt sorry for the main character because she reminds me of the song ""Moral of the Story"" by Ashe, like she needs to heal from pain, not have a secret affair.You can think that you're in loveWhen you're really just in painThe main thing to hinder my reading experience and what I took real issue with is the fact that not one character in this whole book took the main character aside to shake her out of her stupor - not even her mom or the wife.You know it’s one thing if there’s openness and everyone involved is I guess ok with what’s going.But these fuckers were straight-up lying into the wife's face, saying things like, ""I would never touch him"" when she was literally doing just that behind her back. I hated it.Like the straight-up lying into the face of the wife reminds me of Olivia Rodrigo’s lyrics for Traitor Remember I brought her upAnd you told me I was paranoidI feel like the author’s audience is around the same age as the main character so having someone to be like, 'hey, cheating with a married man and lying to everyone is not ok' was a much-needed moment that never arrived. Because If he’ll cheat with you, he’ll cheat on you.

Ипак, као што рекох, највише простора заузима љубавна четвороугаона прича, макар манифестно. Свако ту има некаквих потиснутих или сасвим отворених сексуалних претензија према свакоме; нешто ће се од тога остварити, нешто ће се сублимирати, па на основу тога добијамо и некакав заплет. Све сама декаденција рекли би неки моралисти намрштивши обрве. Расплета у класичном смислу свакако неће бити.Што се стила тиче, нема ту никаквих стилских акробација и барокних украса. Сали Руни пише огољено, фактографски – тад смо ишли тамо, радили смо то-и-то, било је тако-и-тако. Дијалози су дати баш онако како данашња „омладина“ (али и „остарина“) разговара – кратки мејлови, поруке на Месинџеру – то су нова средства комуникације. Ни у ком случају то не бих ставио као мањкавост. Уосталом, Татјанино писмо Оњегину било је сасвим ин и модерно у доба кад је написано.Е сад, оно што је мени много занимљивије од те површне фабуле и љубавне приче, и за шта сматрам да је заиста велика вредност романа, јесте оно што је само овлаш, узгред, као бајаги нехајно напоменуто. А много тога је у позадини. Почев од конфликтних односа у примарним породицама двеју главних јунакиња, проблема одрастања у радничкој, али и с друге стране „буржујској“ породици (Франсес је из сиромашнијих слојева друштва, Боби из богатих), потиснутих социјалних разлика, па све до актуелне политичке ситуације у савременој Ирској, феминизма, права на абортус итд.Важно је напоменути да је ауторка у време објављивања романа имала 26 година, тако да је већ проглашена гласом своје генерације, тј. наречених миленијалаца. Чини ми се да је значајно напоменути и то да и даље има младих људи који промишљају себе и своје окружење. Није као да ће се систем због тога променити, али младост је ту да укаже на неправилности и да покуша да се артикулисано огласи (а Сали Руни то сасвим одлично ради).Све генерације се у младости суочавају са сличним/истим проблемима, да ли се те генерације називају бејбибумери или миленијалци сасвим је свеједно. Суштина проблема младости, одрастања, бунтовништва увек ће остати иста. Зато се и јежим било каквог уоквиравања одредницама попут горе наведених. Отуда, много пута поновљени ламенти да је „омладина све гора, да пропада“, да је „раније све било боље“ звуче као израубовани политички слогани. Никако да достигнемо ту коначну пропаст и кварење омладине.У сваком случају, препорука."

Tokom svojih nastupa upoznaće Melisu koja želi da ih fotografiše za članak, nakon čega otpočinju zajednička druženja koja uključuju i Melisinog muža Nika. Odnos između ova četiri lika glavna je radnja romana, a u njihov odnos utkano je sve ono sa čime se mladi ljudi suočavaju, u većoj ili manjoj mjeri.Ali ono što ovu knjigu čini toliko realnom, modernom, ciničnom, duhovitom, melanholičnom, na trenutke senzualnom, je njen stil, koji svakom rečenicom pogađa tamo gdje treba, dijalozi su oštroumni, neophodni, a opisi kišnog Dablina atmosferu čine koliko tjeskobnom, toliko i oslobađajućom. Njeni likovi su važni, jer u njima vidimo sebe u bar jednom periodu života - okupirani njihovim sudbinama, zapravo želimo da prigrlimo svoje dobre i ne tako dobre izbore.Runi je pronikla u suštinu svoje generacije, koja ne zna na čemu je, koja ima slobodu izbora, a ti izbori često ne olakšavaju svakodnevnicu, naprotiv, njeni likovi prepuštaju se ''overthinkingu'', pisanju, pa brisanju poruka, poređenju sa drugima, nedefinisanim vezama, koje lišene svega tradicionalnog ne ostaju lišene ljubavi i vrteške emocija koju neminovno nose sa sobom.U jednoj od, meni lično, najljepše i najrealnije ispričanih ljubavnih priča, koju čini i toliko drugih složenih odnosa, satkana je sva raskoš moderne književnosti, u mjeri dovoljnoj da mogu bez ustručavanja reći da su mi Razgovori s prijateljima jedna od deset omiljenih knjiga ikada.P.S. Izdanje koje je objavila Geopoetika predivno je s engleskog jezika prevedena od strane Vuka Šećerovića, a jedina zamjerka tiče se korica ovog izdanja koje nemaju nijednu dodirnu tačku sa romanom."

Não resisti e vi a série ""Normal People"", série esta que me deixou com mixed feelings. Adorei o modo como foi feita (a cinematografia está mesmo ""chef's kiss"") e a atuação dos atores mas não gostei da química entre as personagens. Achei tão imaturo e tão superficial. Comunicação era uma coisa que faltava e não consegui ver uma evolução das personagens ao longo da história. No entanto, tive curiosidade em ler um livro da autora, por isso decidi ler ""Conversations with Friends"". Este livro acabou por me desiludir, pois tinha esperança que fosse diferente. Acho que gostei menos do que ""Normal People"".A história relata a vida de duas personagens, alunas da faculdade, em que uma delas se apaixona por um homem casado (não é spoiler, está na sinopse). Li a review da @ensaiosobreodesassossego no goodreads e não podia concordar melhor. As personagens são todas problemáticas e desinteressantes, principalmente as duas principais (Frances e Nick). Todos são muito privilegiados e, citando a Sofia, ""criticam os mesmo privilégios enquanto os usam e abusam deles"".O plot é demasiado simples e desinteressante as well. Nem vou mencionar o quão problemático é o final.Para além do mais, Sally Rooney utilizou algumas partes de ""Normal People"", copiando e colando neste livro, mudando apenas os nomes.No geral, dei 2.5 estrelas em 5. A escrita é boa, a autora sabe como prender o leitor. Pena a história ser desinteressante e muito ""pão sem sal"".E vocês? Já leram este livro? Se sim, o que acharam?"

From the start, I genuinely disagreed with everything they said or did. I felt frustrated with their responses and their behavior toward each other. My big surprise was that with the evolution of the story, i found myself understanding them more and even knowing their immediate reaction. Sally did a great job developing the characters with such details that it felt they were real people. A love story between a 21 years old student and a 32 married man . Say no more! I was shouting so much for this age gap relationship and i didn’t know why! Nick is definitely my favorite character for sure . Even though, I disliked the way they talked to each other. Sally wanted them to look really smart, but who will sit with friends for real and start discussing about complicated subjects like they did. I just wanna have a fun time with my friends and be silly!!!Overall beautiful story! I was so invested in the book that i forgot it was unfortunately all fiction."

(someone please buy her a nice coat)⊹ — thoughts.you know when people comment “i’ve never had a single original experience” ? that’s how it felt reading this book. i related to frances on such a visceral level that i felt sally rooney wrote this book about me (minus the affair; my life isn’t that interesting.)some of the lines frances's parents say to her were word for word verbatim of what my own parents say and the relationship she held with them was so similar to mine own that i had to put the book down and laugh at the irony of reading books as a form of escapism. frances likeness was so immediate to mine that this book did more than years of introspection would have.conversation with friends is one i will probably return to before the year ends, just so i can pick it apart and discover something i missed initially. the 5 stars is partly due to the intense emotional connection i felt with this book but also because i think sally rooney is utterly brilliant and i adore her and her mind.pre review.I LIED I AM NOT OKAY IM SO SAD AND I WILL NOT BE NORMAL ABOUT THIS.

Pastebėjau, kad su šia autore žmonės skirstosi į dvi kategorijas: arba jiems Sally stilius ir pasakojimai labai patinka, arba jie visai su tuo nesusidraugauja. Po šios knygos, pati esu kažkur per vidurį. „Normal people“ skaičiau anglų kalba, lyg prieš porą metų. Buvo keista, bet patiko, įdomu, personažai tai erzino, tai intrigavo, bet susumavus buvo faina. Su šita knyga na, niekaip nesuvibe‘inau. Daugiau erzino ir raukiaus, nei buvo smalsu ar įdomu. Istorija čia tokia paprasta, bet Sally nori pateikti, jog ji vyksta nepaparastiems, o visokių vidinių problemų ir skausmų turintiems žmonėms, kurie man tiesiog susireikšminę pasirodė. Fransė ir Bobė – dvi draugės, studentės, susidraugauja su šiek tiek įžymia sutuoktinių pora Melisa ir Niku. Bobė – save įsimylėjus lesbietė. Fransė – melancholiška, smulkmeniška poetė wannabe. Bobę labai traukia Melisa, jos randa bendrų temų, kartu juokiasi, bendrauja ir mezgą draugystę. Tuo tarpu Fransę nustebina iš pažiūros nuobodus aktorius Nikas, kuris pasirodo besąs visai įdomus ir savų demonų kamuojamas vyras. Tarp jų užsimezga lyg niekur nevedantis romanas, pridarantis aibes problemų ir taip bėdas giedram danguj linkusiems matyt veikėjams.Nu čia viskas man taip išpūsta pasirodė... Daug dramos lygoj vietoj, ir daug kur paviršium praplaukta, kur nelaimes pakapstyt būtų galima ir įdomu. „Normal people“ irgi buvo vietų, kur tiesiog vienas padorus pokalbis būtų išsprendęs skyrių skyrius nemalonių situacijų, bet ten tuos „užsiraukimus“ ir paauglišką tragizmą galėjai pateisint jaunu veikėjų amžium. Čia visi veikėjai nuo 21 iki 35+ metų, tai visi ragelių numetinėjimai, kai kraujuoji ligoninės palatoj, man neatrodė įtikinami. Ir tas tooooks susireikšminimas, tooooks mąstymas tik apie save, tooooks bandymas būt gilesniu/kitokiu/teisingesniu – varė į neviltį. Bet pamąsčiau, kad gal čia yra šiuolaikinio jaunimo standartas, kurio aš tiesiog nepagaunu ir jau prasilenkia mano ir dabartinės kartos suvokimas apie dalykus. Na, kad ir GERIAUSIOS draugės supykimas ant kitos, kad ta pasakė kažką „nefeministiško“. Nu, o Dieve, jūs geriausios draugės – juk tikrai realybėj taip nesakot ir nekalbat. Buvo įdomių vietų, kurias Sally apleido vėl nerdama į nesusitupėjusių žmonių santykius, buvo visai įdomių dialogų, kuriuos Sally sugadino dirbtinai atrodančiais nutylėjimais, buvo epizodų, kur norėjosi labiau paplėtot vidinius demonus, bet vėl įsikišdavo drama drama drama ir neužkabindavo manęs giliau. Nežinau, ne man ši knyga. Bet Sally turi toooookias auditorijas gerbėjų, kad negaliu sakyt, jog ji viską daro blogai. Smagu, kad jos knygose skaitytojai atranda dalykus, kurių man pamatyt ar suprasti nepavyko."

And, let me just say Conversations with Friends is perhaps the best debut I’ve ever read in my life. It’s brilliant and I can’t wait to read Normal People which has been longlisted for the 2018 Man Booker Prize and guess what? I am not surprised!This novel is narrated by Frances, a twenty-one-year-old girl who is vaguely dedicating herself to her academic studies, to writing and to spoken word performance. Vague and peculiar are adjectives that can be used to describe the main character. Bobbi, Frances’ best friend and former lover, is also a crucial character in this book. Unlike our protagonist, Bobbi is spontaneous, beautiful and enjoys being in the spotlight. One night, they cross paths with Melissa, an older photographer and essayist who wants to write a piece about the two girls. This encounter projects Frances and Bobbi to the Irish literary scene which will lead Frances to Nick, a beautiful and alluring actor and also Melissa’s husband.Conversations with Friends was one of those books that reminded me why I love literature above all other forms of art. Sally Rooney’s writing is extraordinary. It’s dry and strange. It rejects ornate language. It’s simply blunt. This is a book that explores the twenty-first century’s relationships, identities and mindset in which dominates a hidden violence. This novel has received mixed reviews and I honestly don’t understand. Some reviewers highlighted the quality of writing but used the unlikeable characters to negatively criticize the book. Are they really unlikeable? They’re not traditional or common. But isn’t that a reflex of the times we’re living right now? I didn’t think they were unlikeable. To me, they were flawed, therefore real.If you love literary fiction, run to the nearest bookstore and get yourself a copy!I’d like to thank Crown Publishing Group for the free copy.

Such a beautiful book I can't say enough good things. 'Conversations With Friends' is so smooth and so real, you are just reading about 4 friends, that's it. Some people may hate this mundanity but in my opinion that is the beauty and power of this novel, and I couldn't put it down. We follow Frances and her best friend (and ex) Bobbi, who meet older, richer, and more sophisticated friends: Nick and Melissa. The four of them become infatuated with each other, each one having a unique and specific relationship with the other 3. This novel is spent in the perspective of Frances, as she tries to navigate these relationships. I fall in love with the four of them more each time I read this book. They are such unique characters. Rooney's writing style is not for everyone,(especially the lack of quotation marks,) I get that, but I absolutely love it. Major moments can become reduced to one sentence and it makes the novel more authentic to me. In real life, there are not broad paragraphs that can describe impactful moments; they happen in a single sentence. This novel had the beauty of a poem and flowed like one, to me Rooney's writing is unparalleled. She wrote Frances in a way that made me hate her and love her and feel pity for her, and in all of those instances not once did her actions feel fake. I want to read the book over and over and over again just to gain a full understanding of Frances and her motive and her thoughts. She is me. This novel had moments that made me gasp, cry and laugh, and I don't think I've ever gotten such a strong feeling of nostalgia like I did for 'Conversations With Friends'. It really felt like I had experienced all of these events before, and I was simply reading about them in a journal or letter addressed to myself. This books was made for me, about me. "

I have done two back to back on audio and was not at all disappointed. This truly is “Conversations with Friends”. If you’re looking for momentous events each chapter this may not be as good of a fit for you. If you want to feel like a silent observer or fly on the wall so to speak you may enjoy this. Her style is for sure her own and unique, and I enjoy the way she tells a story. It’s amazing to me how interestingly she can put together ordinary pieces of day to day life. I find her books and characters incredibly realistic and believable. I asked myself multiple times how it can be a book about nothing but include everything all at the same time. The descriptive qualities differ from other books for me in a way that’s hard to explain, I feel more like I am watching a film than reading a book. It is as if I am listening to a persons most inner thoughts. Raw. Real. Casually watching someone really analyzing themself and their life’s decisions. You share in the character navigating her feelings and all the dynamics of relationships. She is trying to understand herself. She is trying to understand her friendships and relationships. Her parents. Her lovers. While a lot of her seems confused she seems very advanced in her own introspection. For as much as we know about the main character I am surprised I didn’t have more of an attachment to her, I usually am an emotional reader. I didn’t feel overly attached to any character in this book. I was slightly surprised at the similarities in the two books, I don’t think I was expecting that. But it wasn’t enough to make me dislike it. I also did this one on audio and the narrator was very good. I will be on the lookout for new releases by this author and looking forward to them. "
232,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101791985-juan-pablo,Rating 4 out of 5,"a searing and daring novel about the life of a 21 year old writer and her friend as they grapple on their sexuality, relationships, and life, in general. this is my second sally rooney book (in order of my reading), her actual debut technically. the writing is a little juvenile, in relation to Normal People, but i must say that the characters in this book are more interesting, albeit terribly annoying.rooney tackled perfectly the thought process—the vulnerability, pretentiousness, and the stubborn nature—of new adults. i seem to relate somehow to frances because of how impulsive she is. sometimes, she discards herself like trash to explore new things, objectifies herself to resist and question moral grounds, thinking that's what intelligent people do. but i do think it's all rooted to her defiance in acknowledging that what she really needs is true love and affection which, based from her relationship with her parents, is not something she has acquired liberally. i mean, isn't that how some new adults have lived their lives? sometimes older, insecure people, who seem to be bored with their monotonous, tedious lives, tend to search for fun, depend their emotional well-being to the hands of someone who is younger. and if you're young, you take the challenge, you like being adventurous, sometimes you don't even care about the morals. it's just for the good times.i do not condone the characters' actions in the book, but all i'm saying is that sally rooney nailed these characters. i hate how accurate they are, and that sometimes one character's action reminds me of a person i know or a memory of what i did in the past.i read this when on my 26th birthday, 5 years past frances' age, but some events of the past are just hard to forget, and this book made me remember some. yeah, some."

I tend to do that with authors I like, wait on reading their backlist for a while. This novel has a lot of what I like about Sally Rooney, but it feels like a novel told in thirds.The first third introduces us to Frances, who is an observer and not an emoter. She has a lot of similarities to Joan in the Weike Wang novel I just finished (Joan Is Okay) so I kept forgetting she was only 21. She is best friends with Bobbi, who used to be her girlfriend. I liked this section because there were bits that made me laugh, both in how ridiculous they show Frances to be, but also in now it shows Rooney understands this certain kind of thinker, the people who live in their heads, who secretly judge everyone around them.The second third is the majority of the book, where Bobbi and Frances get wrapped up in the lives of a wealthy older couple (as in, they are in their 30s, haha.) This third was very readable of course but felt to me like it travels pretty common ground, and worse, it's with people who struggle to communicate even though they like each other. (I say worse but the author does this intentionally, and I think the reader can engage in their frustration.)The third third deals with a lot of fallout from decisions made but also throws Frances back into struggles with her family, including an alcoholic father. And then Marianne - yes that Marianne - shows up at a dinner party and I was thrown. It has nothing to do with the story of this novel but if you've read Normal People, you will definitely recognize her and possibly go looking in Reddit to figure out where in her story this novel lands.Okay I'm a completist, ready for the next."

Conversations with Friends was a weird one for me, it was a book I didn't want to like. Everything about it sounded insufferable - two arty communist students entering a world of the rich and posh, resulting in a complicated a ménage à quatre. When my raving housemate handed me this, curiosity took over. Little did I know that a few hours later I would be picking up my phone, sending text messages asking Why can't I put this down?? I finished the book within a day. Did I like it? I despited it. Everything in it. The characters are appalling - Frances, a twenty one year old college student and aspiring poet and her self-possessed friend Bobbi are the kind of people you certainly know, but can't help but judge. And yet, they're terribly real, with their hypocrisy, their falsely self-proclaimed knowledge of the world. 
""All right, he said. Well, you've suffered enough. Let's just be happy from now on.""
Sally Rooney's writing is impressive. Extremely observant, she doesn't have to point her finger at her characters, but lets you figure it out all on your own. You can't help but to look down on the characters, their flaws and limited beliefs and by doing that you fall into the trap yourself and will have to realize that you probably don't know any better yourself. Because who really has got life figured out?"

The characters felt so real that it was kind of frustrating. And here I was reading fiction just to stop interacting with them. The narration was undoubtedly manipulative, at least I found it. Not a single character was likable or someone you may sympathize but they are unavoidable. You want to know about their choices though you know they never learn from their mistakes.The book was a honest take about how this young generation feel about several kind of relationships. Loneliness becomes their best friend that gives birth to the mentality of choosing wrong relationships. Frances in certainly an unreliable narrator,you cannot trust het completely cause most of the times she is asking the wrong questions and running after wrong things thar questions her morals.The characters were so close to reality which is though nothing to celebrate about.I loved Sally Rooney's writing style which might be the single reason of my high ratings. The quotation thing did not bother me rather I was intrigued by it.The ending surprisingly was not disappointing rather it was predictable and based on those characters morality made sense.

I am in total awe of Sally Rooney's talent. This is the type of book that not everyone will connect with—and I wouldn't recommend it to everyone—but if you do connect with it, then you are in for an incredible experience.On its face, this is about the relationships that spring up between two couples in Dublin. Frances and Bobbi are college students who perform spoken word poetry and argue about fascism for fun. Melissa and Nick are an artistic couple in their mid-thirties (one an actor, the other a writer/photographer) who act as the adults in the novel. It's possible to read all of these characters as unlikable, but despite their many flaws I never disliked any of them. Frances narrates the novel, and though I would hesitate to say I identified with her, there are so many moments that truly capture the difficult transition to adulthood. Ultimately this is about learning how you see yourself versus how the world sees you, and it's done so masterfully that the entire book felt revolutionary and familiar at the same time."

Está al mismo nivel que Gente Normal, aunque este último me impactó más por el factor sorpresa de poder descubrir a la autora por primera vez. Amé el romance y a la pareja principal (no digo que la apruebo completamente, porque era bastante cuestionable en sí, solo que amo como se relacionaban entre ellos, era interesante, muy drámatico). El drama que se crea alrededor de estos cuatro personajes y los conflictos internos de la protagonista se mezclaron con tanta sutileza y melaconlía; me sentía flotando en una nube, la escritura era hermosa. Mi única queja sería que en el clímax se crea muchísimo drama innecesario, y me pareció medio creado todo a último momento, pero supongo que a todos nos pasan cosas malas y se nos acumulan, nos lastiman tanto que ni siquiera somos conscientes de ello, y como lectores lo vemos de afuera y quedamos medio traumados."

242,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2060997-samantha,Rating 5 out of 5,"NOW AVAILABLE!!!!!!I won an ARC of Conversations with Friends here on Goodreads as a giveaway from Crown Publishing Group, and I'm so glad I did! I'm thrilled to have won this for review, because I have so much to say about it!!! This is by far my favorite ARC that I've ever won. Sally Rooney's debut novel is definitely one of the best books of 2017, and it certainly joins the ranks of my favorite books of all time. Conversations with Friends was right up my alley; it really worked for me and meant a lot to me. I feel so effusive about this novel that it's going to take some doing to not write a book's worth of praise. Thank you very much to Crown Publishing Group for my copy of this gem.Conversations with Friends is narrated by the whip-smart Frances, and right away I loved Rooney's writing style and narrative voice. Frances is twenty-one years old, a student and spoken word performer in Dublin. Frances goes to college with her beautiful and self-assured best-friend and former lover, Bobbi. The two perform the poetry that Frances writes together. One night, their performance catches the eye of photographer and essayist, Melissa. Melissa is successful and older. She takes an interest in Frances and Bobbi, and wants to write a piece on them. The two younger women get caught up in the literary scene and in Melissa's life, with her nice house and handsome actor husband, Nick. Frances and Nick fall into an easy banter with one another, but to both their surprise, their relationship deepens into something more. A time of tumult for Frances ensues. She's beguiled by Melissa and Nick's financial stability, though she identifies as a communist; she's unwilling to make any plans for the future or enter the workforce; and she struggles with issues with her body and her difficult father.As you read Conversations with Friends, you feel you are Frances. That's how submerged you are in her POV. Rooney has a knack for describing certain feelings of disconnect, like Frances's habit of putting on certain faces and practicing certain mannerisms. Rooney has a way of depicting very specific/unusual feelings and making you recognize them. I related a lot and kept thinking: I've felt that way! You feel every pang and pain Frances feels as she feels it. Rarely have I read such a fleshed out character. Frances is analytical, hypocritical, funny, closed-off, chameleonic, dissociative, imaginative, and contradictory. Frances's efforts to protect herself are understandable, even as we see how these efforts might backfire. You can empathize with her even when she's cruel, because it's in retaliation or to protect her own heart.The characterizations are great all around, with all the complexities of human beings. Nobody is just black and white. There's a gray morality that feels very realistic. Rooney is great at capturing the intricacies and nuances of interpersonal relationships. As the title would suggest, this novel features great conversations. The dialogue is superb. Often as important as what's said is what's left unsaid, the subtext behind the dialogue. Conversations with Friends boasts a captivating narrative. You can't look away from the spiraling bad behavior and worsening situations. I loved the setting of Dublin, with characters who are creative types in the literary world and the art scene. The love rectangle that forms is never predictable and always surprising. It reminded me of a Woody Allen movie, with smart adults behaving badly, carrying on affairs, and having misadventures in their city and abroad in France. I think you would enjoy Conversations with Friends if you like the TV show Girls or Greta Gerwig movies. (Kudos to you if recognize the Frances Ha reference towards the novel's end.)This is a great novel with so many layers and a lot of deeper meaning. It's laugh out loud funny. It's fiercely intelligent. It's achingly sad and realistic. It deals with a lot of important themes. It's sexy and romantic and has some great sex scenes as part of its frank depiction of sex and sexuality. I loved that Bobbi is a lesbian and Frances is bi. It's a good book for representation, with a modern, progressive look at relationships and life. Conversations with Friends has a lot of ideas zinging around within its pages. Which makes sense, since Frances and her friends have a lot of idealistic social and artistic views.I can't recommend Conversations with Friends enough. Go pick up your copy July 11th when it goes on sale in the U.S.! Aside from its literary merit, take a look at the gorgeous painting on the cover, the kind of cover you don't see much nowadays. This is a fantastic, introspective debut. Sally Rooney deserves a round of applause. I was blown away by her novel and so impressed. I was deeply moved (I'll admit I cried buckets towards the end, reading it in my backyard, and I'm glad no one came along to see me). So many passages are gems; I was just in love with all of the writing. You wouldn't believe all the sticky notes I used to flag my favorite parts. This book truly spoke to me, and I think it will speak to you too."

""Is it possible we could develop an alternative model of loving each other?""
I am so unwell. I came into this book very apprehensively. On one hand there are people who absolutely love Sally Rooney and stand by everything she says, but then there are other people who think she is boring and her books are very mundane. Personally, this book is one that said so many things that I relate to that I would've never been able to put into words. Firstly, the themes discussed here are so intriguing. The theme of power especially and how it is subverted was one of the most interesting ones for me to follow: because Frances, our protagonist, is young we usually would assume that she has very little power, especially in relationships, however, here Nick, the older party, is actually more submissive and you could say ""power-less"". Because we also see Frances's relationship with her father/mother that kind of feeds into a very Freudian interpretation and analysis of the book and of the relationships that she develops with both Nick and Bobbi. On one hand she has a lot of power, but she isn't impervious to the relationships that Bobbi and Nick form– especially with Melissa.Brings me to another element of the book that I was really intrigued by, a.k.a. female relationships with each other and with age. Melissa, Bobbi, and Frances have very intriguing relationships because all of them are so very different. Melissa is older: she is more seen as glamorous, but ultimately also conniving. Bobbi is the beautiful one who has a very contrarian stance to most current societal structures. The way these three characters move around each other is very realistic and honest. Nowadays a lot of the time there is this girlboss narrative that all female friendships must be this perfect supportive connection, oftentimes that's not the case though. These women hurt each other and they love each other and they demonstrate the heightened nature of bitterness and jealousy and love that can arise during real modern relationships. I loved it.Of course, there is also Nick. I didn't expect him to be this type of character who is very submissive and easy to manipulate. But then again I also didn't expect this conversation on submissiveness being also a form of power over other people in how what you allow people do to do to you, affects them. Nick and Francis's relationship and how it looks like towards the end of the book might not be to everyone's taste, but I don't think that's what the point was. I think the ending really resonated with me because it says something about real people and how we don't always learn from the past; we tend to relish in the forbidden like it is an addictive substance. Once again, I think this show how really honest this book is and that's why I like it.Overall, I loved this book. I was taken aback by all the character work and the way the themes seamlessly interwoven from cells into the fabric of the narrative. Next time reaching for Sally Rooney's other novels and I'm hoping that they're going to live up to the precedent set by this one."

245,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73652386-gabriel-book-duo,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5/5Perskaičiusi du Sally Rooney romanus linkstu sutikti su teigiančiais, kad iš esmės autorė rašo tą pačią istoriją. Ir tai nebūtinai blogai, nes tokios istorijos jos skaitytojams akivaizdžiai patinka. Bet „Conversations with friends“ nelyginti su „Normal people“ kone neįmanoma – pastaroji yra labiau išpildyta ir brandesnė, tačiau abiejuose romanuose nagrinėjamos temos, piešiami veikėjai ir pasakojama istorija turi itin daug bendrų taškų.Nedrįstu teigti ir galiu tik spėlioti, kad autorė įdeda nemažai savęs į pagrindines savo romanų veikėjas. Nes ir jos be galo panašios – daugybė psichologinių problemų, įvairus savęs žalojimas, kuris šiame romane vaizduojamas kiek ryškiau nei „Normal people“. Žymieji Rooney dialogai, dėl kurių pamilau ją skaitydama pastarąjį romaną, čia irgi egzistuoja, tik gal man ne taip stipriai krito į širdį. Tačiau vėl daug kalbama apie klasę, seksą, šį kartą dar ir nemažai apie santuoką, „normalius“ ir ne tokius jau normalius santykių modelius. Būtent tie pašnekesiai ir veda kūrinio siužetą bei priartina veikėjus, kuriuose dažnai gali atrasti kažką artimo, net jei šiek tiek atsitraukus aišku, jog nė vienas iš jų nėra itin simpatiškas. Bet juk tokie tie žmonės.Žinau, kad skaitysiu ir tolesnę Rooney kūrybą, nes rašyti ji moka, o ir kažką manyje užkabina. Visgi lyginant du jau skaitytus jos romanus šis man pasirodė šiek tiek per daug paaugliškai ir aikštingai dramatiškas, tas tragizmas vietomis buvo šiek tiek dirbtinis. Kai kur man atrodė norėta sutalpinti per daug, tačiau praplaukta tik paviršiumi, kai kur paskubėta, tam tikri epizodai rodos buvo kūrinyje tik tam, kad sukeltų šoką. Tiek, kiek mylėjau ir vis dar myliu Marianne ir Connellį iš „Normal people“, tiek irzau dėl Frances, Bobbi ir kitų šio kūrinio veikėjų. Galbūt todėl, kad panašumai su jais buvo veikiau ne keliantys liūdesį, o erzinantys ir nepatogūs. Ir visgi, perskaičiusi kartais vis dar mintimis grįžtu prie šio romano, o tai tikriausiai geras ženklas. Kaip ir sakiau, tam tikrą magiją Rooney tikrai turi, todėl puikiai suprantu ir pasišventusius jos gerbėjus, bet galiu pateisinti ir skeptikus. Aš kol kas esu kažkur per vidurį."

Οι διάλογοι αυτοί δίνονται μέσα από την αφήγηση της Φράνσις (α' πρόσωπο) χωρίς την χρήση παύλας, γεγονός που καθιστά τον αναγνώστη πιο προσεκτικό.Αυτή η μορφή αφήγησης που επιλέγει η Sally Rooney προσφέρει την δυνατότητα στον αναγνώστη να έχει άμεση πρόσβαση στην σκέψη του αφηγητή (Φράνσις) αλλά και των υπόλοιπων ηρώων.Στις σελίδες του ""συζητήσεις με φίλους"" συναντάμε αντισυμβατικούς τύπους που έρχονται αντιμέτωποι με προβλήματα τις σύγχρονης εποχής όπως η ανεργία, η οικονομική κρίση, η εισβολή της τεχνολογίας στην καθημερινή ζωή επηρεάζοντας και την επικοινωνία. Επίσης εντόπισα σημεία που σχετίζονται με θέματα αναφορικά με την θρησκεία και διάφορες κοινωνικές αντιλήψεις. Δεν θα κρύψω ότι διαβάζοντας το οπισθόφυλλο και πέφτοντας στην λέξη Δουβλίνο δεν θα μπορούσα να μην σκεφτώ και να μην αναφερθώ στην επιρροή που τυχόν μπορεί να είχε ο Τζέιμς Τζόυς (Ιρλανδός συγγραφέας) στην Rooney, καθώς σε κάποια σημεία η ηρωίδα φαίνεται να υιοθετεί τον ανυπότακτο χαρακτήρα του Στήβεν από το ""πορτρέτο του καλλιτέχνη σε νεαρά ηλικία"". Ολοκληρώνοντας θα σημείωνα πως η συγγραφέας πέτυχε στην ψυχογράφιση των ηρώων της, ενώ ταυτόχρ��να παρουσίασε ενέργειες των εφήβων/ νέων της εποχής. Σε κάθε περίπτωση ως αναγνώστες είναι απαραίτητο να έχουμε κατά νου τον τόπο που διαδραματίζονται τα γεγονότα (Ιρλανδία) αποφεύγοντας συγκρίσεις με την ελληνική πραγματικότητα.Προσωπικά απόλαυσα το συγκεκριμένο μυθιστόρημα της Rooney. Ξεκάθαρα όμως ο αναγνώστης που αγαπά την πλοκή και την δράση, δεν θα ικανοποιηθεί από αυτό το βιβλίο και ίσως το θεωρήσει μονότονο."
247,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31387283-emily-m,Rating 4 out of 5,"Conversations with Friends shouldn’t work for me. I like a more elaborate prose style, I dislike stories about famous people, I’m often wary of narrators who have too much in common with their writers, or who find unexpected literary success with apparently little effort. Yet it absolutely does work for me, as Normal People did, another unlikely candidate. I would be hard pressed to say which I preferred. In many ways they are very similar, right down to some key lines of dialogue and character names.Much is made of Rooney the “millennial” writer, often with the complaint in the following breath that her characters don’t seem very involved in social media. This may be why I find her books quite universal (who wants to read about students liking each others’ Instagram posts, really?) and really quite classic in their concerns. This is a painfully realistic portrayal of a young woman’s affair with a (somewhat) older married man. I thought Rooney handled the early passion very well, resisting the urge to look forward and taint it with the inevitable future fallout. The focus is on the three main participants’ shifting understanding of each other’s feelings and motivations, and the drama comes from these small epiphanies of misunderstanding, rather from revealing anything dramatic or game changing. It was a rather mature depiction of marriage, for all the narrator’s (and author’s youth).The narrator’s best friend and former girlfriend, Bobbi, was maybe the weakest link – a bit of a clichéd portrayal of a hot, smart lesbian, but well, first novel. A group of twenty-something female writers I know are all obsessed with Sally Rooney. I wouldn’t take it that far, for myself, but I find her compulsive reading and a cool, dry, formidable talent."

Early on I felt like I had a lot in common with the main character Frances when it came to her everyday anxieties, but eventually her inability to be honest and open with those who she was closest to really confused and bothered me. I guess my main feeling upon finishing this was ""what was the point?"" I kept waiting for some sort of human truth to be revealed and if there was one I didn't get it. My main annoyance is how Rooney seemingly threw in issues and characters that weren't fleshed out enough (one example being the character of Frances' father). As someone who has gone through falling in love with my female best friend and entering a relationship with her, I was excited at the prospect of this book talking about characters going through the same thing. But then it was overshadowed by Frances' affair with an older married man, so I'm not sure what the author was trying to say or do with sexuality (maybe just that it's complicated??). If anything, the book made me curious as to what Rooney's life is like and if any of her writing is semi-autobiographical. She was able to so accurately capture the small and everyday intimacies that can occur in same-sex female relationships, and she talked a little about endometriosis which I found to be interesting. Wouldn't read again or probably recommend to others. Feeling a bit like I could've spent the time reading something else."

Ομολογώ πως ως το τέλος, δεν το βρήκα. Η Ρούνεϋ φαίνεται να αδιαφορεί για τη λογοτεχνική γλώσσα, το κείμενο μοιάζει άχαρο και κακογραμμένο. Έχει σε κάποια σημεία φρεσκάδα, σαν να διαβάζεις στάτους στα κοινωνικά δίκτυα, όμως πώς αυτό μπορεί να μετουσιωθεί σε λογοτεχνία ατόφιο και μη επε��εργασμένο, μου διαφεύγει. Τα πράγματα δεν βελτιώνονται ούτε από την ιστορία, γεμάτο δήθεν χαρακτήρες, με σχηματική πλοκή, στηρίζεται κυρίως στην ανάλυση των διαπροσωπικών σχέσεων. Συχνά νιώθεις πως διαβάζεις το «Sex and the city» του 2020.H Φράνσις είναι μια 21χρονη ποιήτρια, που παλιά τα είχε με τη Μπόμπι, ενώ τώρα είναι απλά κολλητές. Μαζί κάνουν περφόρμανς ποίησης, ώσπου τους ανακαλύπτει η 37χρονη κριτικός λογοτεχνίας Μελίσσα. Η Μπόμπι θα γοητευτεί από τη Μελίσσα, μα η Φράνσις θα γοητευτεί από τον άντρα της, τον Νικ. Ο Νικ είναι 32χρονος, ηθοποιός, κούκλος, που πάσχει και από κατάθλιψη. Παρακολουθούμε τη Φράνσις και τη Μπόμπι στην εκδρομή που κάνουν όλοι μαζί στη Γαλλία, όπου η Μελίσσα τις καλεί σε μια έπαυλη που δεν είναι δική της, ενώ η Φράνσις πηδιέται με τον άντρα της. Η πλοκή είναι απελπιστικά αργή, η ηρωίδα- που όταν πληγώνεται ρίχνει και μια τσιμπιά στο μπράτσο της μέχρι να ματώσει και μετά βάζει τσιρότο, ενώ πάσχει από ενδομητρίωση και για αυτό έχει βαριές περιόδους-, είναι μάλλον αντιπαθής και εγωκεντρική.Το να παρουσιάσεις τη γενιά που ανδρώθηκε μέσα στην κρίση, τους εικοσάρηδες, σαν ανθρώπους τόσο ρηχούς, που κινούνται και κοιμούνται με την προηγούμενη γενιά με άνεση μα δεν μπορούν να δέσουν ούτε τα κορδόνια τους, είναι επιφανειακό και εύκολο. Το θέμα με τα chat και τα mail δεν τσουλάει, φαίνεται παρωχημένο. Η τεχνολογία μάς προλαβαίνει συνεχώς, αν το έγραφε τώρα η Ρούνεϋ, μόλις 2 χρόνια μετά, η γλώσσα θα ήταν ήδη άλλη. Αυτή η γλώσσα είναι και το βασικό πρόβλημα. Για να γράψεις μυθιστόρημα σε μια γλώσσα έξω από τα καθιερωμένα λογοτεχνικά πρότυπα απαιτούνται κότσια και γνώση. Εδώ φαίνεται η συγγραφέας απλά να μην μπορεί, και να το επιδεικνύει κιόλας.Εν ολίγοις, θα περίμενα από ένα μυθιστόρημα σαν κι αυτό, πολλαπλά επίπεδα. Για να μπορέσει να εκφράσει μια γενιά, δεν αρκεί η στείρα καταγραφή ενός κομματιού της, με μια γλώσσα του συρμού, απαιτείται άλλη δεξιοτεχνία. Το βάθος δεν επιτυγχάνεται όταν κανείς το παίζει μπλαζέ και αδιάφορος, αντίθετα χρειάζεται σκάψιμο και προσπάθεια. Εικάζω πως αν η Σάλλυ Ρούνεϋ είναι η νέα Φρανσουάζ Σαγκάν, ο νέος Τρούμαν Καπότε ή ο νεός Σάλιντζερ, όπως κατά κόρον διαφημίζεται, τότε η λογοτεχνία μας θα έχει σοβαρότατα προβλήματα στο μέλλον. "
261,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13862041-gillian,Rating 4 out of 5,"Sally Rooney’s the only person capable of making me feel miserable after finishing a book.If you’ve read a couple of Sally Rooney’s novels or short stories, you’ll realise that:- she does not use quotation marks- her characters are appalling and highly unlikeable- she writes complex relationships- her stories are open-ended- and definitely not for everyone.Conversations with Friends takes on a much deeper theme than  Normal People. This book explores an intriguing topic about non-monogamous relationships and illicit affairs, which would probably appeal to a more mature audience. I personally enjoyed Normal People more with its coming of age theme because it's more relatable at my current age. But I do love that this book introduces the ugly side of love and the complexities of being in a relationship. It’s kinda ironic though that this book is entitled Conversations with Friends when it appears that the main characters do not communicate well with one another. I noticed that the lack of communication is a recurring theme in Rooney’s works. It's frustrating that these characters often do not speak out what they feel. But I honestly couldn’t blame them because they're portrayed realistically. I couldn't emphasise this enough but I really love Sally Rooney's writing style. It's effortless and simple, but each word cuts to the core. I also love how this book ended with a more positive outlook than Normal People. I honestly wasn't sure how I wanted this story to end, but after reading that ending, I was satisfied and I felt miserable and awful about myself for actually wanting Nick and Frances to still see each other. 
""I should have known it wouldn't work out between us.Didn't we always know that? he said.I paused for a second. Then I just said: I didn't.""
Overall, I'm in love with Rooney's books and it's always an emotional havoc having to read them but I ain't complaining. She can wreck me all she wants."

Things and people moved around me, taking positions in obscure hierarchies, participating in systems I didn’t know about and never would. A complex network of objects and concepts.You live through certain things before you understand them. You can’t always take the analytical position.
Using mundane, every day observations Sally Rooney has written something so thought provoking yet easy to ponder over. I was so amazed with her ability to let us in these four people's lives: Frances, Nick, Bobbi and Melissa; arranged in the order of my preference and likeness. While I usually evade topics such as extramarital affairs, suppressed trauma and marriage. This book had laid them out in such a simple way that it never polarized me, in fact it intrigued me- how these characters went on and about with their life and dealt these in such a flippant way. I was obsessed with Frances partly because I can see some parts of myself when she spoke or theorizes parts of her life. Rooney wrote an unlikeable yet likeable character tailored exactly for the headspace that I was reading with. Also, hey, I'll be turning 21 in the coming months and the way she tackled her lack of ambition is commendable. I'm not anti capitalist but yeah some of the points she raised were so genuine that it had me on the edge. Bobbi is like a mix of all the people I have met in my 20s and she is refreshing to say the least. I could also admire her being upfront and abrasive when it comes to making arguments. As a character she certainly drew Frances out of her shell more. The parts that I enjoyed reading most was about the way Frances and Nick developed over the course of the chapters and how much I adore and find their relationship so cool and real. Those were certainly my favourite bits to read. Also, Joe Alwyn as Nick is a big hell yes and I know it was fated. He will definitely capture Nick so well. Can't wait to see it on screen."

Have you broken me?A perfectly imperfect story,with perfectly imperfect characters.Conversations with Friends tells a story from two fronts:🍃 The entanglements of our four protagonists’ lives — exes-turned-best-friends and a married couple.🍃 The inner workings of Frances’ life and mind, a bleak view on how hard everyday life can be.In true Sally Rooney fashion, we have unlikeable characters who make bad decisions, on more bad decisions, (on some more bad decisions). But at the same time, you want to reach in and hug them and tell them it’s okay — who hasn’t made a string of bad decisions?Maybe that’s why I love Rooney’s works.She doesn’t sugarcoat life.They’re flawed, frustrating, irritating.They’re pretentious, morally gray.They’re human.But despite the layers and difficult themes, Sally Rooney executes the novel in a very subtle way — never overly dramatizing and simply maximizing everyday life’s capacity to overwhelm us with “little things” until we look around and see a life that closely resembles a hell we fear.At its core, it is just so unmistakably Rooney — her knack for understanding her readers’ dreams, anxieties, musings, is unlike any other.You read a passage and find yourself with an almost visceral reaction to its familiarity.And i think that’s what got to me.Bumping up my original 4.5 stars to 5 stars because hot damn Rooney, you did it again 🥵------------1ST READ: Sally Rooney is a so brilliant with her dialogue and imperfect characters. What a captivating read. It's always great reading about generally unlikeable characters who make irrational (or as I'd rather say, human) decisions begin to unfold to allow its readers to better understand them.  “Gradually the waiting began to feel less like waiting and more like this was simply what life was: the distracting tasks undertaken while the thing you are waiting for continues not to happen.”  You live through certain things before you understand them.

What change? The trailer for this series. I really didn’t know what it was about and honestly the trailer made it so good. I decided to give it chance and i’m glad I did. This is her debut novel and I wish I started here. Sally Rooney books are very character driven with minimal plot. They always talk about relationships in very different scenarios and that is why I think her books are very special. Also, they incorporate real life issues and not the usual perspective that you here. I hate to compare it but this book address these issues way better than “BWWAY.” In this one it leaves you thinking and in the other one it leaves you with a WHOLE ASS CHAPTER on an issues that honestly I find it so boring. Most of the issues don’t partake in the story. I find it irrelevant. As in this one, it really makes you think and it seems more casual. It doesn’t add to the problems but it gives something to the story. I think why people don’t like these books is because the characters are not that likeable. But i think that is why the story is good, the characters are really flawed. I personally did like them (I like toxicity lol) but i get they are hard to love. I really identified with Frances in way I never imagine. I like how self-aware she became in the end, I definitely saw growth. Even tho that could be argued with how it ended. I didn’t like Melissa at all but I think she is like Frances in many ways and i’m glad that both of them realize it. I like who is playing her in the tv show. The role fits perfect for her. Side note, the casting for the tv show IS PERFECT. I’m so excited! As plot goes…there is not much. It basically this 4 people navigating relationships but you see it from one perspective. I’m surprised how much I liked it and was invested in it. I was never bored which i’m so glad compare to her other book, I was very bored with some of the chapters. I just wish I was invested a little bit more with Nick and Frances relationship. I think I would have appreciated more the ending. Although, I’m happy with that kinda opened ending. I just don’t feel so attached to the story. I wish that Bobbi and Melissa would form more of romantic relationship than friendship…It would have made things more interesting for sure..The what-ifs questions this book has are amazing…I really liked it and it easily redeemed Sally Rooney books for me.

She has a knack at focusing on the details, from the reactions to a text message to a simple hand gesture. granted one could say that her novels are mini soap operas and I wouldn’t disagree entirely.The book is narrated by Frances, a 21 year old and has habits that are typical of her age. She is self-aware, combats her insecurities with sarcasm, hates calling people, relying on text messages. Likes the over complicated romances presented in Greta Gerwig films. Frances’ closest friend is Bobbi, who was her lover once upon a time. At this stage in her life she is an intern and writes poems but secretly wants to write stories.One day Frances and Bobbi get an invitation from another writer, called Melissa, who wants to profile her for an article. They oblige and Frances starts an affair with Melissa’s husband Nick.As one can guess the rest of the book follows the exploits of these four people. In theory this would have been an awful novel but Rooney pulls it off. The reason being is that she goes into the psychology of her character. Throughout her fling, Frances sense of self awareness increases and she starts to question why she is continuing this affair.I also liked the fact that there are no bad guys or good gals: all four people have their faults and take decisions that work for or against them. Not one person is to blame as all four people contribute to Frances’ and Nick’s relationship.Rooney does not take the conventional way out either by the end not all relationships remain unresolved, I’m glad that the book took that route. Saying that this book is not perfect. I thought it got a bit too intense at times and at 320 pages it does go on for a bit. I personally preferred Rooney’s second novel Normal People, which a more concise novel and yet has all the same characteristics of Conversations with Friends.So what exactly is the message of Conversations with Friends? Love in the 21st century? How people never change? How relationships reflect a personality? there’s a lot of open ended questions which makes this novel a worthwhile read."

Там, где другие писатели накручивают спецэффектов, у Руни тихий рассказ, который можно прочитать по-разному. Для кого-то это книга про любовь и чуйства, для кого-то история лесбиянки, у которой случился период гетеросексуальных экспериментов, для кого-то это классическое противостояние с протагонистами и антагонистами (нет, серьёзно, об этом ближе к финалу прямо а лоб говорят).Но самое интересное здесь, опять же, глубоко внутри. Ты видишь запутанный клубок чувств и эмоций, пытаешься его логически распутать, но не получается. За минималистичной ширмой скрывается ураган, который сложно обьяснить и надо ли вообще что-то говорить? Не получается осуждать или оправдывать поступки героев, потому что свой похожий квест ты провалил.

Part of me was unsure what to feel about “Conversations with Friends” by Sally Rooney at first because so much of the story casually follows the lives of a group of relatively privileged friends. The novel is narrated from the perspective of introverted young poet and university student Frances. She and her performance poetry collaborator/ex-girlfriend Bobbi befriend journalist/photographer Melissa and her semi-famous/effortlessly handsome husband Nick. Frances describes her time with this group of people as they attend book/art gallery launches, parties or holidays in France – all while conversing about politics, popular culture and gossip about each other. In particular, the story focuses on Frances’ challenging affair with Nick and the effect this has upon everyone around them. The novel builds a subtle power as it traces the disconnect between what we say, how we act and what we’re really feeling. She shows how it usually takes time and distance to really understand the meaning of what we felt and our friends’ different positions. It’s striking the way Rooney captures the sense of alienation we can feel within friendships where we often struggle to converse about the things that really matter.Read my full review of Conversations with Friends by Sally Rooney on LonesomeReader"
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269051-bruno,Rating 5 out of 5,"The only reason I was hesitant to give the full five stars is because I already gave her second novel five stars and I didn't want to come across as the fanboy that I've become.The distant, dispassionate writing of Rooney is a strong reason why this book is so good and the character of Frances is so strong. Absolutely stunning.(Yes, it took me a while to finish it, but that's only because I didn't want to finish it.)--[Update 2024]In 2019 had ik dit boek al onbeschroomd de zeldzame volle vijf sterren gegeven op Goodreads, en na deze herlezing kan ik dat alleen maar bekrachtigen. Conversations with Friends is en blijft een waanzinnig goed boek.Het hoofdpersonage Frances wordt door velen afgedaan als te koel en te klinisch, maar net het afgemeten proza van Rooney zorgt voor een bijna onmenselijke diepgang van Frances' gevoelens. Het is zo terughoudend en tragisch dat het bij de lezer bijna fysiek pijn doet. In de portrettering van Frances blijft Rooney gelukkig ver weg van de stereotiepe egocentrische millennial, maar wordt het verhaal veel ruimer opengetrokken. Frances is vooral verloren in de wereld en zichzelf en weet niet hoe ze moet omgaan met anderen en met haar eigen kwetsbaarheid. De laatste zin van het boek is een hartverscheurende climax van de evolutie die Frances is doorgegaan."

Znowu o wchodzeniu w dorosłość, braku poczucia bezpieczeństwa i znowu o nierównościach społecznych. Jest też wątek, którego poruszenie bardzo mnie ucieszyło, ale o którym powiedziec Wam nie mogę, bo jest z końcówki książki - Ci co przeczytali na pewno wiedzą, o co mi chodzi. Jest jednak „ale” - jest inaczej niż w „Normalnych ludziach”, którzy podobali mi się bardziej, i w których więcej wyczytalam między wierszami. „Rozmowy z przyjaciółmi” byli dla mnie po prostu bardzo dobrą obyczajówką, jednak nie tak refleksyjną jak poprzednia. Nie jestem też wielką fanką tego typu narracji pierwszoosobowej. ALE powtórzę raz jeszcze, według mnie to bardzo dobra obyczajówka, realistyczna, niegłupia, z fajnymi dialogami i ukazująca problemy, z ktorymi mierzą sie dziś milenialsi. Jeśli więc poszukujecie niezobowiązującej lektury i jesteście fankami/fanami Rooney to jak najbardziej polecam."

The only interesting part that I found, Frances' health scare, ended very anticlimactically. The whole book was actually very anticlimactic. The characters were all equally unlikable. All of them were selfish, pretentious and uninteresting. None of the characters had a unique voice or personality.

Apparentemente è una storia banale: una ragazza di 21 anni troppo introspettiva e insicura ha una relazione con un uomo sposato più grande di lei. A differenza di quanto si legge/sente in giro, l'originalità o il valore di questa narrazione non sta nel fatto che il dialogo tra i protagonisti si svolga anche via email o con qualche sms. In questo non c'è niente di speciale.Quello che io ho adorato è la capacità totale di rendere l'introspezione della protagonista in uno stile completamente paratattico e privo di descrizioni sui sentimenti. Noi sappiamo quello che prova solo vedendo ciò che le succede o ciò che fa.La narrazione è completamente credibile, dall'inizio alla fine, la capacità di tutti i personaggi coinvolti nel complicare i rapporti è verosimile e per me l'identificazione con la protagonista (aspetto comunque non necessario) è stata totale.Insomma, Sally Rooney scrive benissimo e può veramente scrivere di qualsiasi cosa."

Dialoghi brillanti, personaggi complessi, vicende accattivanti, ""Conversations with friends"" è il debutto di una scrittrice nata nel mio stesso anno (1991) che ci regala una visione con una prospettiva autentica sul mondo dei nuovi giovani, per cui ogni cosa è instabile, il futuro, il lavoro, il proprio corpo...ma in cui l'amore si fa strada prepotentemente, una forza istintiva.

She shaped the whole thing into a very compelling read with her sharp prose and realistic dialogues, the deep insight into communication and power dynamic in interpersonal relationship. The voice and the main protagonist, Frances, radiated 'The Bell Jar' vibe, albeit in my opinion an inferior one, nevertheless with its own pulling force. The ending unfortunately was unsatisfying, perhaps it fit with the characters' trait, but it left the feeling of back to square one, erasing the arch of its protagonist's journey. People we crossed path with didn't have to stay, it didn't have to last, sometimes we only met some people so that we could help each other in our journey through self-discovery and the understanding of life."

Empecemos por la faja. «MARAVILLOSA» (Nunca te lo perdonaré, The New Yorker) «LITERATURA en mayúsculas» (Madre mía El País). Mentira todo. Mentira podrida. Conversaciones entre amigos va de gente idiota haciendo el idiota. Va, como Los detectives salvajes, de amistadas, de amigos que hablan pero ni son amigos, ni hablan, solo dicen frases grandilocuentes y vacías llenas de palabras sin sentido y cargadas de «soy un alma sensible e incomprendida». Al despelleje. La protagonista es Frances que es a mí me parece imbécil. En artículos por ahí he leído, guiñando muchos los ojos y mirando de refilón de la vergüenza ajena que me daba, que es un personaje frágil, autodestructivo y blablablabla. No, no es nada de eso. Es un personaje ridículo, cargado de clichés de supuesta modernez que resulta sonrojante. Tiene veintiún años y a Bobbi, su amiga, que es la lista de la relación y de la que Frances, sorpresón, tiene envidia por lo desenvuelta que es, lo inteligente, lo bien que habla, lo segura de sí misma que está, bla bla bla. Como esto no es la tetralogía de la Ferrante pero la idea es la misma, aquí las dos amigas han sido pareja amorosa durante un tiempo. Para cuando el lector, yo, tiene la desgracia de conocerlas ya no son pareja pero se llevan fenomenal y hacen lecturas públicas de poemas porque son de la ""bohemia artística irlandesa"" (Carcajadas. Si yo fuera de la bohemia artística irlandesa le ponía una bomba a Sally por esta apropiación indebida del término). Una noche, tras una de sus lecturas y por arte de birlibiloque conocen a Melissa que es, por lo visto, una fotógrafa de cierto renombre y que es mayor (treinta y cinco). Melissa las invita a su casa a cenar y a dormir. ¿Por qué? ¿Por qué te llevas a dos desconocidas a tu casa a cenar y a dormir? ¿Melissa no tiene amigos? ¿Quiere asesinarlas? ¿Montar una orgía? El lector, ósea yo, se hace estas preguntas porque estás en la página tres del libro. Según avanzas en la lectura te das cuenta de que nada tiene sentido ni motivo, todo es un ir y venir de lugares comunes. Sigamos. ¿Quién está en la maravillosa casa de Melissa? Su maravilloso marido, Nick, treinta y tres años, que es también idiota pero espectacularmente guapo. Esto no lo digo yo, lo dicen en el libro unas mil veces, de hecho cada vez que le nombran: «A Nick le gustaba ir a nadar y luego salir del agua con la piel resplandecientemente húmeda, como en un anuncio de colonia», «Nick tenía un torso imponente, parecía una escultura», «Lo imaginé sonriendo para sí al teléfono, lo ofensivamente guapo que debía parecer». Me encantaría poder describiros a este Adonis pero a la autora se le ha pasado contarnos si es alto, bajo, rubio, moreno, pelirrojo, calvo, con gafas. Debe ser que es «guapo» como absoluto, como concepto abstracto... esto debe ser la LITERATURA para ella. Bueno, en un giro completamente inesperado de la trama, tan inesperado como que el sol salga por Antequera, Nick y Frances se lían. Después de que se líen todo es un de un sopor y un aburrimiento inenarrables. Páginas y más páginas de «Mire a Nick, tan guapo..., yo me sentí mal. ¿me querría? Quería sentirme poderosa, controlarle pero mis ovarios me dolían y quería morirme pero ¡ay qué guapo es!» A lo mejor alguien se pregunta qué pasa con Melissa y Bobbi que en teoría deberían pintar algo en la historia. Bueno pues son las comparsas. Por un momento pensé que Melissa era una mala muy viciosa y lo que pretendía con la amistad con las chicas era montarse una orgía pero no. Cuando le dejan un casoplón de vacaciones en Francia e invita a las dos chicas a pasar una temporadita allí, la actividad principal que despliega es la limpieza y la cocina. Frances por supuesto tiene dudas sobre la conveniencia de irse de vacaciones con su amante y su mujer pero las resuelve en unos treinta segundos. Las resuelve tan bien que por las noches se chusca a Nick. Melissa y Nick no comparten habitación, ¿por qué? No sé, qué más da. Las escenas de sexo con diálogos del tipo «No recuerdo si al principio pensé en todo esto. En que lo nuestro estaba condenado a acabar mal» dice ella, «Yo sí lo hice. Pero también pensé que valdría la pena», son cumbres de vergüenza ajena porque, como lector, uno siente que los personajes están follando pensando ¿estoy guapo? ¿doy bien en cámara? ¿mi frase tiene suficiente profundidad moral? El lector, al contrario que los personajes, no solo sabe que acabara mal sino que desea que, como poco, irrumpan unos terroristas los secuestren, los despellejen, les hagan tragar treinta kilos de polvorones y les pasen a cámara lenta sus diálogos para que aprendan lo que es sufrir... pero sigamos. Las vacaciones en Francia terminan y todos vuelven a Dublin. Bla bla bla se vuelven a encontrar, chuscan, Nick lleva un abrigo precioso «Me levanté de la cama y metí los brazos desnudos en las mangas, sintiendo la fresca caricia de la seda sobre mi piel. (...) Nick deslizó una mano por dentro del abrigo y me acarició los senos» (otra cumbre). Como he dicho antes, todo es un ir y venir sin decir nada, sin avanzar, sin interés. Frances tiene problemas de dinero porque su padre, un borrachín del que sabemos poco y es, sin embargo, el personaje con más interés del libro, le ha dejado de pasar la asignación y claro ser pobre también le preocupa a la pobre Frances pero no tanto como para pensar en trabajar. «Nunca he pensado en trabajar». Pues estupendo, Frances. Pasan cosas poco interesantes, aún menos interesantes que la trama principal y por algo que ya he olvidado Melissa se entera del affair amoroso y le manda un mail a Frances en plan «soy moderna porque el mundo me ha hecho así y aunque me jode un poco que te chusques a mi marido, él ahora está más contento así que todo ok» Mis risas se escucharon en Sebastopol. Se montan entonces una relación abierta («El amor tradicional es cuestionable» pone en la faja) en la que Nick chusca con las dos y todo parece ir sobre ruedas. La anormal de Frances dice que es su novio y va por la vida tan feliz pisando flores de la mano de Nick, que lleva su «maravilloso abrigo», hasta que Nick, un buen día, le deja caer que «Ey churri que también me chusco a Melissa» y entonces Frances cae del guindo y claro, THE GREAT DRAMA. Y tú dices pero, alma de cántaro, ¿qué te creías?Bueno pues luego viene el dramita: llora, se auto lesiona, no come, sufre muchísimo, muchísimo, muchísimo y se desmaya en una iglesia. Llega a casa, escribe a Bobbi que se había enfadado por algo que ya no recuerdo y que no importa nada. Bobbi se planta en su casa, se dicen que se quieren y vuelven a vivir juntas. Hablan muchísimo. «¿Acaso me hago llamar tu novia? No. Llamarme tu novia sería imponernos una dinámica cultural prefabricada sobre la que no tenemos ningún control. ¿Entiendes?» Y esta es la lista del libro. (Otra cumbre de vergüencita ajena)Y ¿cómo termina esto? Pues un buen día Nick va al super a comprar pimientos amarillos y no hay. Así que llama a Melissa para preguntarle si valen los pimientos rojos y ¡tachán! se equivoca de número y llama a Frances. (Juro solemnemente que no me invento nada) Hablan, ella le pide consejo sobre como tratar su endiometriosis (sigo sin inventarme nada) y se dicen cosas que ni siquiera un guionista de tv movie alemana se atrevería a escribir como «No puedes imaginar lo difícil que me ha resultado no llamarte» «Creí que me habías olvidado por completo» «Me horroriza la idea de olvidar aunque sea el más mínimo detalle sobre ti». Esta cumbre de supuesta LITERATURA con mayúsculas acaba cuando ella le dice «ven a buscarme». Y el lector, ósea yo, le implora al guapo por antonomasia: Sí, Nick, ve a buscarla y acaba, por favor, con este sufrimiento, con este lodazal de lugares comunes y aburrimiento. Los personajes de El Cuarteto de Alejandría de Lawrence Durrell deben estar carcajeándose. Eso sí eran amigos que conversaban sobre amores no tradicionales. "

A escrita de Rooney é brilhante, e é a cereja no topo do bolo que é a sua obra. Julgo que o que mais apreciei em ""Conversations with Friends"" foi o facto do livro não ter sido escrito para que se gostasse dele. Seguimos a história através da perspetiva da Frances, uma personagem tão crua e tão cheia de camadas que quase nos coloca num transe durante a leitura. Estamos na sua cabeça; as suas emoções são nossas para sentir. A Frances não é a típica personagem desenhada para criar empatia no leitor, e julgo que esse foi um dos motivos pelos quais isso aconteceu logo comigo. Não é um livro para toda a gente, mas acredito que quem gostar de ficção contemporânea tem aqui um pequeno tesouro para explorar.

Absolutely amazing.
By far the best Rooney book I read.I read her two other books – Normal people and Mr. Salary and I loved them both, they were a strong 4 for me, but this book is on a whole other level.I can’t wrap my head around the fact that this is her 
first
 novel. I looked into Sally Rooney a little bit online and found a great article about her writing and an analysis of her two books so click this link to find out more:https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/3/...If you want a shorter, much more inadequate review of this book I’ll keep it short. This is one of the most current books I have read in a long time. It had managed to capture the feelings that are often not talked or written about in general adult fiction, but what the majority of the newer generations feel. You know how some books just make you feel comforted that somebody else in the world has thought of the same thing as you or felt the same way as you did – this book goes so far in that aspect that It is 
scary
. Rooney put into words all of the emotions and thoughts that I felt during my life and then wrote a book. And I know I am not the only one who feels this way. A lot of her avid readers agree with that, that’s how they acquired the adjective avid.There are some parallels with Rooney’s second novel Normal Friends, but all of that is better said in the article I linked above.I have a feeling that this book will be in my thoughts for a while, and I will probably return to write down more of my thoughts here as well, so in conclusion, 

BUY THIS BOOK!

What if you only considered yourself from the outside? Worried that you might not appear smart or attractive or worthy, while gazing into a snowglobe that contained all of you? Poor Frances’ emotional range is severely limited - which is a well described effect of being a Child of an Alcoholic. If your life is unpredictably dangerous - vulnerability, maybe even sadness, certainly disappointment - are a few of the emotions that must be thwarted, right? Frances brings this to extraordinary heights. Those around her must define her.She asks: “Am I allowed to feel that?” When she realizes that she has made what she thinks is an adroit facial expression, she bemoans the lack of witnesses:“I laughed to myself although there was no one there to see me.” And the sorry recurring riff: “if I had a personality…” So I found her actions predictable. She sees herself only from afar. What would Frances’ writing be like? Clever descriptions of concrete actions, told ever-so-sardonically? Speaking of herself as though she were elsewhere.  To me this story is a tragedy, a very modern and, lamentably, very common tragedy."

This one relies on a standard trope – “younger woman (21) has an affair with an older handsome married man (30s) and complications ensue.” Protagonist Frances is an Irish poet who lives with Bobbi. They used to be in a relationship. They are now friends who perform poetry readings together. Frances gets involved with Nick, a wealthy actor who has no plans to leave his wife. I liked the first part, up to the point of the affair, but once that started, it went downhill rapidly. Except for Frances, the characters lack depth, and this is a big issue for a character-driven novel. If explicit sexual content is not your preference, I would avoid it. The novel is filled with disagreeable people. Frances and Nick are obsessed with hiding their feelings as a type of control. They learn little over the course of the story. I was planning to give it three stars up to the ending, which ruined it for me. Without revealing, I can only say it was disempowering and am surprised that the author went in that direction. 2.5"

Historia głównej bohaterki była typowa dla książek autorki i naprawdę spodobało mi się jak to wszystko opisała, emocje i odczucia Frances były adekwatne do tego w jakiej sytuacji się znajdowała. Wszystko działo się w swoim tempie, co bardzo mi przypadło do gustu. Wydarzenia opowiadały życie głównej bohaterki i przyjemnie się tego słuchało podczas wieczornego spaceru.

Nie spodziewałam się, że dam ostatecznie taką wysoką ocenę. Cenie jednak w książkach emocje jakie podczas czytania ich odczuwam, to jak wpływają na mnie i na ile zaintrygował mnie przebieg zdarzeń.

She really does gnaw at the human condition in a way that so many other writers try to achieve and yet don't. Frances, Bobbi, Nick, and Melissa as characters are pretty abstract and yet incredibly precise, and somehow, the pretension doesn't both me in the way it usually does with literary fiction.

Un libro che parla di fuffa, ma la spaccia per i grandi misteri della vita con una prosa che a tratti si prende troppo sul serio, a tratti pare una presa in giro.Definirei: nuddu ammiscatu cu nenti. Le dinamiche relazioni: pani duru e cuteddu ca nun tagghia.No, grazie."

He is 32. Close to death almost😀) as I said after NORMAL PEOPLE, Sally Rooney definitely loved Milan Kundera and tried to transfer it to young adults. As well it is very obvious that book is written by young girl as all “old” people and especially Nick’s character is completely unbelievable. She could stick to writing about her age people, because imagining how grown ups think and are is totally different from real life. Not bad, but not great. I believe she will write very good books in a future"

Sally Rooney must either have a friend that's just like me or be like that herself because there's no way i can relate to her fictional characters like that. whenever i read a book of hers, it confronts me with the worst parts of myself. in a good way though. i loved all three of them and i hope a new one is coming soon."

El libro es un abrazo muy fuerte en cada pagina, no hay frase que no me identifique. Desde que se me diagnostico mi enfermedad perdí la normalidad en mi ser, jamás me había sentido tan retratado en un escrito, gracias por esto sally rooney, eres mi escritora favorita :)"

It takes a great deal of skill in a writer to make you see through the eyes of a person you would not necessarily approve of in real life. A manipulative, cold, egocentric twenty-something who sleeps with your husband and preaches marxism while inflicting physical pain on herself. What's there not to like about Frances? "

324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119144198-alice-almeida,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.4É galera, a Sally e sua capacidade de escrever sobre fragmentos de vida em personagens que lutamos em não nos identificarmos. Temos aqui os mesmos elementos que encontramos em pessoas normais, acho até que de forma mais crua, é perceptível o amadurecimento da escrita da Sally, mas essa é uma estreia incrível da autora. Os personagens são insuportáveis em nossas piores versões. E, apesar de não me identificar em toda a leitura, nas suas últimas páginas me deparei com a versão de mim mesma que há tempos apagava da memória.“eu queria as coisas para mim porque achava que eu existia[...]. Seria possível nós criarmos um modelo alternativo de nos amarmos?”Eu gosto muito da escrita da Sally, me pega como poucos autores de romance contemporâneo fazem. Ela escreve para além do romance quando não desassocia dele. O livro é extremamente coerente a partir da história que entendo que ela conta. Um fragmento de vida de uma personagem incerta em seus 21 anos, a somatização das dores desse personagem, é corpóreo, físico, mental, racional e irracional. A nata artística e seus egos e preceitos. Duas graduandas se entendem como possibilidades. Tudo em meio a vivências, amores, desamores, descobertas de si e do outro e família. Na escrita da Sally a família está presente até mesmo quando não está.É engraçado ler esse livro de fora, tentado não se colocar na história, pois não tem como não pesar para racionalidade, coisa que você não deve fazer kkkkring. Sally Rooney desenha o caminho feito pela Frances de forma bizarramente real, e se prestarmos atenção todas suas possibilidades estão lá. É um personagem interessantíssimo, mas difícil de acessar. Ler sobre ela me deu vontade de escrever demais, entro no limbo de uma das coisas que mais gosto de ler em literatura: ""pessoas normais, vivendo situações e suas formas de relacionar com si, com o mundo e com outro de forma real"" o não convencionalismo das narrativas da Sally me ganham demais.""eu era como uma xícara vazia, e agora preciso ver o que fora derramado de mim: todas minhas crenças ilusórias sobre meu próprio valor e minhas pretensões de ser uma pessoa que não era""Por fim, sim acho too much os diálogos teóricos em meio a conversas corriqueiras, mas de fato essas conversas existem, e só ilustram a nata que a Sally queria caricaturizar, dei boas risadas com as cenas imaginando pessoas que já conheci falando daquela forma. E queria muito menos do Nick, que personagem insuportável, e todos seus nuances estão na história. E o fim… a previsibilidade que se faz coerente."
325,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5831406-delirious-disquisitions,Rating 5 out of 5,"I can't quite articulate all the emotions Rooney makes me feel with her writing. It's a kind of wretchedness, like catching yourself reflected on a surface with all your innermost disgusting, pathetic, needy, and self-destructive tendencies laid bare, naked for all to see. I feel like such a masochist when I read her stories. Somewhere in the intimate messy affairs of messy people, Rooney makes you experience a whole gauntlet of emotions: dread, hurt, anxiety, giddy happiness, the ordeal of being known, the fear of dissapointment, etc. Yet there is something so compelling about her characters and their relationships. It's like watching a train wreck happen in very slow motion in real time: it's dreadful and horrifying, and yet somehow you're frozen and can not look away. 5 stars. RTC for when I'm not as overwhelmed by feelings."

Der Schreibstil war einfach und gut zu lesen, aber in der Mitte hab ich dann irgendwie das Interesse verloren. Wir begegnen Bobbi und Frances. Beide sind Studentinnen Anfang 20 und hatten eine Liebesbeziehung miteinander.Nun lernen sie Melissa und Nick kennen, ein Ehepaar, was beruflich gut positioniert ist. Beide gutaussehend und ca. mitte 30. Frances und Nick scheinen sich genauso anziehend zu finden wie Melissa und Bobbi….. Für mich was es leichte Kost zwischendurch. Leider hatte ich hier etwas anderes erwartet. Aber so ist das manchmal. Es kann nicht jedes Buch ein Highlight sein. Meiner Meinung nach, verpasst man nicht sehr viel, wenn man dieses Buch nicht gelesen hat…. . "

329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12460952-bill-kupersmith,Rating 3 out of 5,"If you strip out all the adjectives, such as “cool-headed, & darkly observant” (actually Frances is totally off the wall & coming unglued) and “difficult & unhappy father” (unreliable & drunken father) “intellectual certainties” (once fashionable bolshie pose) & “living from moment to moment” (directionless & detached), the blurb gives you a fair idea of what this book is about. This is a favourite & much repeated theme in first novels. A young woman writer becomes entranced with a sophisticated older couple, & with the complaisance of the spouse has an affair with the mate. As this book is clearly ‘literary fiction’ rather than ‘chick-lit’ (direct discourse is not set off in inverted commas – like a French novel – evidement litteraire, n’est-ce pas?). That absence annoyed some readers, but this book is much better as an Audible anyway, I think. The narration by Aoife McMahon was absolutely beautiful. The pronunciation she gave Frances’s monologue was what perfect English ought to be: you’d sound like a cultured person speaking that way in any English speaking country without sounding affected or snobbish. It only sounded Irish because some vowels were a bit pinched and ‘thigh’ sounded like ‘tie’ to my ear – the ‘th’ is a survival of Gaelic, usually rendered ‘d’ in eighteenth-century drama texts. The principal artistic problem is the characters’ failure to display the qualities Frances says they possess. She tells us of Bobbi that on ‘the war in Syria’ she ‘displayed a remorseless intelligence seeming to have read everything on whatever topic . . . correcting him only when necessary for her broader argument, not even alluding that she’d almost completed a history degree.’ None of Bobbie’s observations is quoted and we are left to think: ‘Wow! An undergrad who’s expert on Middle Eastern affairs. I imagine she’s already read a couple of articles by Charles Glass & Robert Fisk.’ I must admit I found Bobbi attractive, tho’, probably on account of what Frances doesn’t tell us. What we sense is not Bobbi, but what Frances feels about Bobbi. And that is true of her attraction to Nick as well. Very typical of a first novel about a young person coming of age. Frances is given some complexities (like a medical problem & a same-sex relationship) not found in classic novels of teens such as Bonjour tristesse, but adheres to the standard pattern, including a socially downscale mother. Frances is also the kind of unbeliever who feels something visiting church, but otherwise there’s not much spiritual insight in this novel. If you want to read about relationships that don’t really go anywhere, but want to feel you’re reading literature rather than chick-lit, this book will do it. Also practise speaking like Frances on the audio – you will sound lovely. I know this is a slightly bizarre review, but so is the book."
