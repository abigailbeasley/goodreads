0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155007415-brooke,Rating 4 out of 5,"➸ 4.5 stars➷ the seven husbands of evelyn hugo by taylor jenkins reid is a captivating novel that delves into the glamorous and tumultuous life of the enigmatic hollywood icon, evelyn hugo. the story is narrated by monique grant, a young journalist who is given the exclusive opportunity to interview evelyn hugo, now in her late seventies, about her legendary career and her seven marriages and tumultuous relationships that shaped her career and personal life. as monique delves deeper into evelyn’s story, she uncovers shocking revelations that force her to confront her own past and identity.— this book honestly surpassed my expectations. i’m always a bit iffy about reading popular books, but i absolutely loved this story! i honestly did not expect it to make me cry so much, seriously this book had no right ripping my heart out into tiny little pieces. i don’t even think this was supposed to be an emotional read but my heart just broke for these characters and how they weren’t allowed to love whoever they wanted. i grew so attached to these characters and parting ways with them was such a tragedy to me lmaoo. evelyn, celia, harry and john are truly my little family. i should’ve closed the book after the picnic scene and just pretended that they all lived happily ever after 😭💔tjr’s writing style is just mesmerising. she has this incredible ability for drawing you into her stories with such vivid detail that you feel like you’re right there in the moment, experiencing everything alongside her characters. this story transports us back into old hollywood and it makes me feel like i’m immersed into the glitz and glamour of the ‘50s and ‘60s silver screen. psa: mick riva needs his own tw. i’m so tired of having to see that deadbeat’s name!! he is a jump scare at this point. ➳ evelyn hugo:

“i’m bisexual, don’t ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box.”

she’s an icon, she’s a legend and she is the moment. she’s so effortlessly glamorous, she’s brilliant and powerful but that doesn’t mean she is a good person — but she’s not an unlikeable character. i understand all the decisions and sacrifices she had to make to get to where she is in life. she done some horrible things, but she would NEVER take them back because she only wanted to protect the people she loved the most. she is a flawed character, she’s ruthless, selfish, manipulative and she is unapologetic about her life choices and wasn’t afraid to use her body to get important roles. evelyn always has to get her own way but that made me love her even more and what gave her so much depth. she lived her life the best way she could. she had a dream she was determined to fulfil and she knew what she had to do to make her dream a reality. ➳ celia st. james: 

“all i’ve ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. but you’ve never been mine. not really. i’ve always had to settle for one piece of you. while the world gets the other half. i don’t blame you. it doesn’t make me stop loving you. but i can’t do it. i can’t do it, evelyn.”

SCREAMING, CRYING, THROWING UP!! I WILL KEEP SAYING IT, THEY DESERVED MORE TIME TOGETHER!! TJR YOU ARE A SICK WOMAN, YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM MY THERAPIST 😭😭 oh celia, the love of evelyn’s life. she’s another complicated character but i actually loved her, she’s the complete opposite to evelyn. she embodies kindness and compassion in her own right. while evelyn was portrayed as confident and assertive, celia’s demeanour was more reserved and gentle. she could be mean-spirited towards evelyn, i get she always done it out of hurt and jealousy but she had to understand that evelyn went to great lengths to protect their relationship from ever being exposed. but celia loved and cared for evelyn so deeply. tjr perfectly captured celia’s selfishness and her closeted struggles, as well as her complicated feelings with having to share evelyn with others. i would do ANYTHING for celia’s pov especially during the time when they didn’t talk for 5 years 😖 ➳ harry cameron:

“it’s ok, you can fall down now. i’ll catch you.” so i fell down. and harry caught me.

the friendship between evelyn and harry is truly so special. they are the epitome of ‘platonic soulmates.’ he was present for the majority of evelyn’s life. their friendship is built on a foundation of mutual respect and understanding. they will always have each others back no matter the circumstances. my heart broke with him when he lost john because he ended up losing himself that day too. i loved his relationship with his daughter, she was truly the light of his life and what kept him going. he deserved the world and he deserved so much better. we all deserve a harry cameron in our life <33➳ monique grant:as evelyn’s chosen confidante, monique finds herself drawn into a world of glamour and intrigue far removed from her own humble existence. tasked with penning evelyn’s long-awaited memoir, monique is granted unparalleled access to the inner workings of evelyn’s mind and heart, a privilege that comes with its own set of challenges and responsibilities. but i’m going to be straight up and say that her character honestly has no importance to me whatsoever. as a secondary character she was overshadowed by evelyn’s life and her character lacked so much depth. the reveal of the significant plot connection to evelyn later on left me feeling underwhelmed due to the lack of emphasis on monique and her story throughout the book. ꒰ evelyn + celia: ꒱

“i spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much i loved her.”

i am a evelyncelia defender for life!! if they have no fans, i am dead. their love story is absolutely heartbreaking. their connection is electric, their moments together is filled with so much raw emotion and undeniable chemistry. yet as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that they are star-crossed lovers, bound by societal expectations and personal sacrifices. yes it seemed complex but at times their relationship was toxic. the ache for more time together is palpable — i’m so mad bc i wish they had so much more time together, to bask in their love without the constraints of society or circumstance. they were robbed of many precious moments and they lost so many years. every stolen moment between them is filled with longing and passion, it constantly had me yearning for more. yet amidst all the heartache, their love for one another shines so brightly. they are truly the epitome of soulmates. their relationship was so heart wrenching because they truly deserved so much better. they deserved to love each other freely and unabashedly!! ❤️‍🩹— overall, this book is a masterful tapestry of love, ambition, and the search for identity set against the dazzling backdrop of old hollywood. tjr’s exquisite prose and nuanced characters invite readers on an unforgettable journey, challenging them to reflect on the true cost of fame and the enduring power of authenticity. with its gripping narrative and rich historical detail, this novel transcends its genre, leaving a lasting impression on all who have the pleasure of delving into evelyn hugo’s captivating world. this story made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me angry but i adored this book and these character with my whole heart. i can’t wait for the netflix adaption, my heart is going to be broken all over again and i’m so ready for it lmaoo. ───♡─────────────why did this book have me crying like a lil bitch 😭 i am evelyn hugo’s #1 defender until the day i die!! rtc —this slump is eating me alive!!! also the fact i still haven’t read this book is criminal. in tjr we trust 😩"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77602709-maria,Rating 5 out of 5,"5/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.” This book is phenomenal. This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It's a pure 5 star for me. I'm irrevocably astonished and astounded. I want to hug and kiss this book till I bleed. I couldn't leave it down. I just couldn't. Storytime. It's 12:36am, I have to wake up in 7 hours or so and I'm casually reading this book. I'm on page 233, 50 pages after it got amazingly good for me. And then this line makes its fucking appearance. ""I have no idea that in less than a week, Evelyn Hugo will finish her story, and I'll find out what this has all been about, and I will hate her so much that I'll be truly afraid I might kill her."" LIKE??? AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK. And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn't survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let's talk specifics.Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, the 
Outlander
 and 
Ross Poldark
 kind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me. I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I didn't quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I'm into the book 100%, ready to know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren't any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I wouldn't have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She isn't a character to me. She is a person. With influences from Merilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like ""Oh, I will watch that movie next."", and then I remembered that she doesn't actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can't help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she isn't ashamed about it. She doesn't give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one. Monique. An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I didn't care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn didn't let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she hasn't achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn's story started, we didn't get much of her. But I'm so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I'm really proud of her. THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can't entail good representation. IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it's a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I wouldn't have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn's life is so engaging and complicated, you can't get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It's more about talent, at the most part. I'd like to hope so. In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I'm gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation. WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I'm scared they would ruin it. I'm always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I couldn't recommend this enough. It doesn't matter if you don't read historical fiction or adult, PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won't regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!"
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69106439-virginia-ronan-herondale,Rating 5 out of 5,"”Evelyn always leaves you hoping you’ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.”This book was so, so, so GOOD!! I swear I was barely two pages in and already knew that I’d love it with all my heart! <3 There’s just something about that golden Hollywood era that captivated me right from the beginning and once Evelyn entered the scene I was a goner. I just loved the way her story was told! We didn’t only get the interviews with Monique but also were able to read news articles about her life and this made everything so much more intriguing. I mean “Hollywood Digest”, “Sub Rosa” or the “New York Tribune”, they all wrote about Evelyn’s life and those articles give an authenticity that makes this book feel real. It could have happened, Evelyn could have been a real Hollywood Star and people could have been as fascinated by her as by Marilyn Monroe or Marlene Dietrich. I think to some degree Taylor Jenkins Reid might have even had Marilyn Monroe in her mind when she wrote Evelyn’s character and knowing how awesome Marilyn was this really doesn’t come as a surprise. XD Another thing I appreciated was that every husband got a part of this book and even though there were seven of them, who all influenced Evelyn and left a mark on her character, none of them actually was her one true love. It’s a very particular approach to a great story and I loved the way it was carried out. Still, after I read the ending my mind was reeling and my feelings were so mixed that I had a tough time coming to terms with everything that was revealed. There were so many things I felt conflicted about and even now, after more than a week has passed, I still didn’t manage to sort out my feelings and I still don’t know what to do with them. Maybe I’ll have to get used to the idea that to think about Evelyn Hugo and her seven husbands will always make me feel conflicted and that there’s no such thing as making peace with an ending like that. And maybe, just maybe, that was Taylor Jenkins Reid’s plan all along. ;-)The characters:
Welcome to my characters section, aka “The spoilery spoiler zone”! If you didn’t read the book yet and still want to be surprised by its revelations you better don’t continue to read my review. I’m worse than any tabloid mentioned in this book and I’ll spoil you relentlessly! If you still want to read my gossip, go ahead, but don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-P
Evelyn Hugo:”And I didn’t say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don’t feel regret for the things I’ve done – at least, not the things you might expect – despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.” Oh, Evelyn! Where do I even begin? I loved that woman so damn much, I can’t even! <333 It’s so rare to meet such a complex character in a book but damn Evelyn just had it all! She was neither white nor black, and if anything she was all different shades of grey. I loved that she was so ruthless, that she did what she had to do in order to get what she wanted, that she was unapologetic about her decisions and behaviour and that she never held back and just wanted it all! Celia was right, at times Evelyn could be really awful and egoistic, but damn did her good qualities make up for it. Compassionate, caring and protective of the ones she loved she would have done everything possible to keep them safe and happy. Gosh, WHAT. A. WOMAN!  I think I might be in love with her! <333”Did I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.””I told her every single day that her life had been the world’s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.” ”I regret every second I didn’t spend with her. I regret every stupid thing I did that caused her an ounce of pain. I should have chased her down the street the day she left me. I should have begged her to stay. I should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the Hollywood sign and shouted, ‘I’m in love with Celia St. James!’ and let them crucify me for it.”Celia St. James:”I really like you. I like watching you on-screen. I like how the moment you show up in a scene, I can’t look at anything else. I like the way your skin is too dark for your blond hair, the way the two shouldn’t go together and yet seem so natural on you. And to be honest, I like how calculating and awful you kind of are.”Now here’s the thing, I know that Celia was the love of Evelyn’s life and I could see that they loved each other deeply, but – and here comes the huge 
BUT
 – I had the feeling that I could never truly connect to her. I don’t know what it was that kept me from adoring her the way I adore Evelyn but I think it might have been the sum of thousands of little things that ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. For instance I hated that Evelyn always seemed to feel like she had done something wrong and that it was her responsibility to set things right again. I mean Celia threw a lot of awful things at her too, but in the end it always seemed to be Evelyn that blamed herself for it. Also I didn’t like that Celia wasn’t only self-righteous but also more than just a little judgemental. You’d think a person who represents the “L” in LGBTQ+ would be more accepting and open-minded when her partner is bi, but nope Celia was almost as bi-phobic as the men in Evelyn’s life and that made me really sad. =(”That was how it was with Celia. When you denied her what she wanted, when you hurt her, she made sure you hurt, too.””So I told myself that the spark between Celia and me was just a quirk we had. Which was convincing as long as it remained quirky. Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”Harry Cameron:”I want to be with someone I love. I want to have a companion. I’d like to bring someone home to my family. I don’t want to live alone anymore. And I want a son or a daughter. We could have that together. I can’t give you everything. I know that. But I want to raise a family, and I’d love to raise one with you.”Aside from Evelyn, Harry Cameron was truly the best thing about this entire book! <33 I loved this man so much and I think he’s an angel! He was always respectful and supportive and even more important he accepted Evelyn exactly the way she was. I loved that he and Evelyn always tried to solve every problem together and I hated to see him so sad after the death of John. T_T Harry’s grief broke my heart and even though he was drinking way too much he never did anything stupid. I mean he never hurt Evelyn or got frustrated with her, he only tried to compensate his grief without hurting anyone else in the process. Even when it came to this he was considerate and kind. =(( Poor Harry, though. It made me so damn sad that he had to go and I admit it, I actually shed some tears when he died. T_TMonique Grant:”Why, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn’t like it to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?” To say their relationship was complicated would be putting it more than just mildly! It was really interesting to see Monique’s character arc though. I mean at the beginning she was a shy mouse that didn’t dare to say anything to her boss and by the end of the book she was a young successful woman who stood up for herself and finally had the guts to make decisions she never even dared to consider. I think that to get to know Evelyn and to find out the truth behind her father’s death was necessary to find her happiness and I’m convinced that both of those things were able to give her some closure. I could understand her anger towards Evelyn, her hurt when she found out what she had done and the inability to truly hate her for it. Because she got to know the person behind the movie star and she knew how broken Evelyn was on the inside, how much pain she had suffered, how much loss she had endured. =( Still, that scene when she pondered whether to get on the train or not, the thoughts that crossed her mind, her inner struggle how to deal with the situation at hand. Damn, this was one of the best book moments I ever had the pleasure to read. Well done, Taylor Jenkins Reid, well done! I had goose bumps following that inner conflict. *shudders*”I’m Evelyn.” She reaches out and takes my hand, shaking it. It strikes me as a unique form of power to say your own name when you know that everyone in the room, everyone in the world, already knows it.””I insist that you be ruthless in your negotiating, Monique. Make them pay you what they would pay a white man. And then, once you’ve done that, every penny from it will be yours.”The relationships & ships:Evelyn & Celia:”I wanted to give her a lot of things. I wanted what I had to be hers. I wondered if this was what it felt like to love someone.” Those two were the death of me, I swear! Their ups and downs, their struggles and fights, their love and dreams, their hopes and shattered realities. ARGH! It was so obvious they loved each other, yet they could never be together. Because the world didn’t let them and wouldn’t have understood, because they didn’t want the same thing, because they weren’t ready to be in a relationship and unable to make arrangements. Because… just 
BECAUSE!
 There was always another reason why they couldn’t be happy, another misunderstanding that tore at their foundations, another bump on the road that caused them to drift apart. They loved and lost and loved and lost again. It was so heart-breaking to watch! And Celia, she killed me. With everything she said to Evelyn! I knew she loved her, yet she hurt her so much! >_< I just wished she would have had more sympathy for Evelyn’s outlook and I really wish she would have tried to understand Evelyn’s sexuality. So many of their problems could have been solved, they could have gained so many years if they just would have allowed themselves to be who they are. Their love was so tragic… more tragic than any of the movies they produced over the years. And it really made me sad. T_T”Evelyn, who was your great love? You can tell me.”Evelyn looks out the window, breathes in deeply, and then says, “Celia St. James.”The room is quiet as Evelyn lets herself hear her own words. And then she smiles, a bright, wide, deeply sincere smile. She starts laughing to herself and then refocuses on me. “I feel like I spent my entire life loving her.””It’s not wrong,” Celia said. “It shouldn’t be wrong, to love you. How can it be wrong?”“It’s not wrong, sweetheart. It’s not,” I said. “They’re wrong.””If you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything,” she said. “And we have always loved each other so much, more than I ever thought I could be loved, more than I ever thought I could love. So why … why couldn’t we overcome it?”“We did,” I said, turning towards her. “We’re here.”She shook her head. “But the years,” she said.”There’s a difference between sexuality and sex. I used sex to get what I wanted. Sex is just an act. Sexuality is a sincere expression of desire and pleasure. That I always kept for Celia.”Evelyn & Harry:”You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”So I fell down.And Harry caught me.Their friendship was everything, absolutely 
E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G.!!!
 Gosh, I loved their relationship so much, I can’t even!!! They were so perfect together and understood each other better than anyone else. They were so close it sometimes felt like they could read each other’s mind and I think of all the husbands Evelyn married over the years, Harry definitely was the best! <333 (Of course her last hubby was awesome too but if you ask me no one was able to hold a candle to Harry!) I know Harry was gay and had no sexual desire for women and I know that Evelyn loved Celia but damn those two made so much sense! They shared a love that is sometimes even harder to find than the once in a lifetime love we all crave for and they were so much more than just friends. They were business partners, equals, best friends, partners in crime, confidants, soul mates and kindred spirits. And most importantly, they loved each other deeply! <333 It’s so rare to find a friend like that, so rare to have a connection like that, to be loved liked that… ARGH! I just LOVED them!!! This was such a wholesome representation of a deep friendship and I’m incapable to put it into words. *breaks down and sobs* ”I promise I’ll do whatever I can. I promise you we will figure this out.”“OK,” Harry said, and then he squeezed my hand back and walked out the door. “We will figure this out.” ”I want you to stay, Harry. We need you. Me and Connor.” I grabbed his hand tighter. “But if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it’s time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.” The bi rep:”It really makes you think, doesn’t it? That people were so eager to believe we were swapping spouses but would have been scandalized to know we were monogamous and queer?”And now we finally come to one of the most important subjects of this book: The bi rep! And let me tell you, it was spot-on! Evelyn is a bi icon and for the rest of my life I’ll never get tired of emphasizing how important this kind of representation is! Throughout the entire book Evelyn is confronted with bi-phobia but she always took it in stride! She accepted herself the way she was and she did an amazing job at trying to explain her sexuality. I know some of you might say that it shouldn’t even be necessary to explain your sexuality to others and I’m inclined to agree, but the bitter truth is that we have to explain it no matter if we want to or not. I can only speak from personal experience here but usually straight people have a hard time understanding how you can love both sexes equally and make no difference, while lesbian or gay people might just try to label you as one of their own. What Celia did?! It happens! It happens way too often and even though her actions and behaviour left a bitter taste in my mouth it still represented one of the many facets of reality. I loved the way Taylor Jenkins Reid gave Evelyn a voice though. Evelyn Hugo didn’t accept those prejudices, nope, she gave us her honest opinion, her point of view and made the other characters acknowledge her for who she was! And this was wholesome and healthy and might help a lot of people to accept themselves! So thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid! Thank you very much! <333”Being bisexual didn’t make me disloyal,” Evelyn says. “One has nothing to do with the other. Nor did it mean that Celia could only fulfil half my needs.” ”I hated being called a lesbian. Not because I thought there was anything wrong with loving a woman, mind you. No, I’d come to terms with that a long time ago. But Celia only saw things in black and white. She liked women and only women. And I liked her. And so she often denied the rest of me.””Wow,” he said. “Incredible. I married a dyke.”“Stop saying that,” I said.“Evelyn, if you have sex with women, you are a lesbian. Don’t be a self-hating lesbian. That’s not… that’s not becoming.” My conclusion:The more I think about this book, the more I love it! This is such an important read! I know Reid tackled a lot of problematic topics in this book, but she did it in such a positive and sensible way that I’m convinced everyone who reads “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” will learn something good from it! I’m usually not the kind of person who throws a book at you and says you should read it but in all seriousness: Read this one! Live and suffer with Evelyn, enjoy her good moments and cry with her when the world throws her for a loop! Hate her, love her, accept her the way she is. And most importantly, learn from her mistakes and don’t hesitate to show the world your true self. ;-)I know this review has been already way too long but I still want to thank the ever charming Ashley for this wonderful buddy read! We both didn’t have it easy while reading this book together, but we always managed to find a compromise and were able to continue once our lives started to become a little less hectic. *lol* I’m glad we could read this together and I hope sooner or later we’ll find another book to buddy read again! =)"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52545435-elle-ellexamines,Rating 5 out of 5,"This review contains a spoiler for a reveal around 100 pages into the novel. I knew this reveal going in and do not believe knowing this reveal hurts the reading experience.I think a lot about the idea of love as something dangerous, as something that you have to fight for. And it's only recently that I've decided that's something that probably has to do with loving women. I have been very lucky, in growing up in liberal California and in the 2000s. But I received marriage rights in my country four months after realizing I liked girls, and in reading about the past and thinking about the past, I am constantly, daily, reminded how being born ten years earlier would have made everything that much more dangerous, that much more violent, that much more fearful. And there is something so woefully romantic to me about the fact that there were people who braved that climate and loved anyway and paved the path, while doing so, for me and so many others.So that's all to say that this book made me experience all five stages of grief and simultaneously made me feel every positive emotion in the world and I have no idea how that is possible. but listen, if you only read one book I recommend you this year, I want it to be this one.

“Make them pay you as much as they would a white man.”

The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is, yeah, about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Seven husbands who are sometimes awful and sometimes sympathetic and sometimes somewhere in between. Ernie, who she used to get to where she is, Don, who beat her till she barely knew whether to continue, Harry, who she loved more than any of them, Max, who loves the idea of her more than he could ever love her. But I think, despite its marketing, this book is really about Evelyn. Awful, complicated, completely lovable Evelyn. Evelyn is a flawed, compelling, brave, ambitious woman who got to where she was with teeth and claws and never gave up. She is also, and I’m not even joking, one of the most iconic characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. She is a woman with a lot of ambition but also one who loves and wants to be loved. She is such a good character.This book is also fiercely and unapologetically socio-political and I love that. Evelyn’s story is one of being a woman in a man’s world. It is one of being a Cuban woman in a white woman’s world. It is one of being a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to women was demonized by the whole culture. It is one of hiding yourself for ambition, one of trying to decide which one takes precedent, one of aging, and one of never knowing whether your choices were right. Annnnnnnd this book also has the most fucking heartbreaking romantic relationship I have had the displeasure to read about in my entire life. I don’t… I don’t know if romantic relationships should be considered spoilers, but… well, I knew going in who the actual love of Evelyn’s life was and it STILL WORKED FOR ME. So here it is: Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James are one of my favorite fictional relationships, of all time, ever. These two have a complicated, flawed, at times tumultous relationship, and yet they love each other so much, always. 

“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”

And perhaps my favorite part was the messaging around the importance of actual love in relationships, rather than just a willingness to try.
“You didn't come here and tell me how much you miss me. Or how hard it has been to live without me. You said you didn't want to give up. And I don't want to give up, either. I don't want to fail at this. But that's not actually a great reason to stay together. We should have reasons why we don't want to give. It shouldn't just be that we don't want to give up. And I don't... have any. “You have never felt like my other half.”
I know I’ve talked about a lot of specific things in the book, but I don’t know exactly how to put into words what this book meant to me. You can almost feel how much Taylor Jenkins Reid felt this book. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo left me an emotional mess, but also a happy mess. All I know is I feel ruined for any other book, and I want you to be as well.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube"

The Written Review
3.75 stars



Heartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.
Evelyn Hugo was the star of the century. She dominated the big screen for more than four decades. Every man wanted her and every woman wanted to be her.Perhaps most famously, Evelyn Hugo was married seven times. Each divorce only increased her fame. Rumors swept through the tabloids like wildfire.
I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.
And now, age 79, Evelyn Hugo decided to auction off her most wildly famous gowns and offered one lucky journalist (Monique) an interview that will last a lifetime.However, Monique soon learns that this is beyond a two-page spread. Evelyn Hugo is offering a tell-all - a full biography - that promises to be the most 
scandalous and salacious 
thing that has ever graced this world.Monique would be a fool - an absolute fool - to pass this up. But the thought, the 'it's too good to be true' sort of thought, continues to replay in her mind. 
Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.

Overall, this one was good but I was never wowed. 
Everyone and their mother was talking up this book and while I agree that it is engaging and scandalous (in a good way)...I don't know. I just expected more from it.I definitely think it was well-written...just a bit dull in areas. We start the book with 40 pages of just talking up Evelyn Hugo and it really did drag. There's only so many times I can hear about how 
wonderful and stunning
 a person is before it gets boring.I think if more of the marriages were teased in the beginning - just to give the audience a taste of the mystery surrounding her love life (rather than going on and on about how intriguing it was...without telling us what was intriguing about it) would have helped significantly.Once we got to her life, the book certainly picked up. I really loved how Evelyn's sexuality was portrayed in this book. I liked watching her grow as a person - from a teenager using sex to get herself out of a hellhole to falling in love and finding it something to be cherished.Her love for  Celia throughout the years truly made this wildly unbelievable story cinch for me. Honestly,  her relationship with Celia Their love was expertly done, with all of the fear and paranoia associated with the times, that it truly felt like real life. Ultimately, this was an enjoyable read, a bit slow paced, but enjoyable nonetheless!
Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.

5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 4 out of 5,"WOW I NEVER POSTED THIS. What a pleasant surprise! After dozens of unposted-unwritten reviews, finally an unposted-but-written one. Life is beautiful.But first off (I can call this first off if I freaking want to!!!) I wanna say: DON’T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT HISTORICAL FICTION CAN’T BE DIVERSE. Tell that anthropomorphized tennis ball they’re either uncreative or a secret bigot or a full-on dunce or ALL THREE. Because this book pulls it off with more than a tablespoon of grace, I’ll tell you that.My guy, there aren’t even that many characters in this book. And we’re following the majority of them starting in the 1950s. Not exactly, y’know, the peak of support for diversity in America. AND STILL WE DON’T LACK FOR REPRESENTATION. Do you get how great that is? I’m ready to punch the whitesplainers of Disney’s Frozen in their boring pale faces. The word “Frozen” is actually a reference to the lack of movement in the creativity centers of their brains. (Follow for more behind the scenes Disney-Pixar facts.)This book includes three (three!) interracial relationships. Actually, it’s more like ten if you count the fact that our protagonist is Latina. Yes! This may be the bare minimum, but I’m so used to YA wherein one pale as snow teen romances a - gasp - pale as paper teen! Diversity in young adult books = one character is of Western European descent and the other Eastern European. Talk about a vanilla romance. (Buh dum ch.)This book proves how important it is to provide diversity. The difference in the believability and intricacy of the story is incredible. I will say we don’t often get a good look at the variance in culture that comes with diversity here. Evelyn Hugo, though the daughter of Cuban immigrants, purposefully represses her heritage in order to fit in with the whitewashed 1950s and ’60s cinema scene. Our narrator, though half-black, expresses a fear that someone will tell her she’s “not black enough.” I wish the ethnic diversity played a little more into the text, but it didn’t feel unrealistic or anything. The reasoning was explained.But there’s even more diversity. Like, it gets even better. Because, again, despite the time setting, this book contains A SH*T TON of LGBT+ rep. And these are some of the most beautifully portrayed LGBT+ relationships I’ve ever read. If you don’t read this book for anything else, read it for that fine-ass inclusion, boi.Beyond that, this is the ultimate guilty pleasure book. IT IS SO FUN READING ABOUT OLD HOLLYWOOD AND OLD MOVIES. I wanted to watch the entire Evelyn Hugo canon after this, and then it was like, oh wait, she’s not real.I don’t have much else to say. This is chick-lit-y historical fiction at its finest. It’s just so fun. Some people say they got bored halfway through, and I get why you could, but I didn’t. I really fell in love with the world of this book, and the depiction of Old Hollywood, and all that jazz.A lot is revealed over the course of the book, and the best part is just being surprised at each twist and turn, so I don’t want to go to specifics even a little. I’m just going to cut off this review here before I risk, like, accidentally mentioning that Evelyn Hugo’s third husband turned her into a vampire and she was a vampire the whole time and she turns Monique at the end of the book.*Damn it!Bottom line: This is very fun and cool and maybe even important. Read it!!!*This isn’t true, by the way. Duh.----------------------rereading updateswas tempted to spend my whole day watching old movies and not reading at all.compromised by rereading this instead.this was a very good plan.----------------------pre-reviewThis book? It's really great.I got a hell of a lot more than I bargained for. "
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 5 out of 5,"This right here. This is why I read. For the joy and privilege of coming across an exquisite story like this and being swept up in its magic.Could The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo really be fiction, dreamt up entirely in Taylor Jenkins Reid's mind? Every moment felt so real, so tangible. When I reached the end, it was hard to let go, hard to return to a world where this was nothing more than a figment of the imagination.Evelyn Hugo, revered Hollywood actress and icon, is finally ready to tell the story of her life. But she wants to make sure that whatever comes out is authentic to who she is. So she contacts Monique Grant, a mostly unknown writer, to be her scribe. Everyone is surprised by the choice, no one more so than Monique herself. But to be given the chance to write Evelyn's memoir and to understand the person behind the legend is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, one that Monique can't pass up.When I first started this, I thought I was in for a fluffy, gossipy romance set in the golden Hollywood era. After all, why would anyone need so many husbands unless one was in it for a good time? But this turned out to be so much more. At its heart, it's a stunning and brutally honest portrayal of love in all its different forms. It shows not just the joy of love, but also its sacrifices and heartbreaks. I was blown away by how complex of a character Evelyn Hugo is. She is the heart and soul of this story, and her character shines so bright, it's hard to look away. She feels real, coming off the pages wholly formed. She's not perfect. In fact, her flaws and numerous questionable actions make her human, and it's easy to relate to her and cheer for her.The book is written in alternative viewpoints, a little bit from Monique's perspective as she interviews Evelyn and a lot from Evelyn's perspective as she shares the story of her life. When a book has two different viewpoints, there's always a fear that one is more interesting than the other. But not here. I can honestly say that every moment of this book was equally riveting.I adored Reid's writing style. It's filled with so much charm that it just oozes off the pages. The story obviously tackles serious issues, but the writing never takes itself too seriously. It's witty and funny, drawing me in and making me feel every emotion. It manages to convey so much nuance without ever slowing down the pacing or seeming long-winded. I'm in awe. You guys know I'm a romantic through and through. And this story is all about finding and holding on to that great love of your life, no matter what it takes. I mean, how could I not be drawn to that? I'm also a realist and I know that love takes so much sacrifice. So this story spoke to my heart and my mind.I never really had a chance. This book had me good and hooked, right from the first page. It's the sort of story I know I'll come back to again and again, savoring it anew every time.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Carrie Soto Is BackDaisy Jones & The SixMalibu Rising~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

Is Evelyn Hugo going to tell me just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat but never enough to truly reveal anything?
I can't say for sure what drew me to this book. It's not the kind of thing I usually pick up, and I haven't read anything by Reid before. But something about it intrigued me. So I checked out the kindle sample. Just a couple chapters, I figured, because I probably wouldn't like it anyway. And I was HOOKED.It's perfect, easy beach read material. It's not particularly deep, it does not take the genre to new levels or make you think about something new, and yet it DID feel different. Evelyn Hugo's story was so delicious and compelling that it stood out, and kept me turning pages in a desperate need to discover the stories behind her seven husbands, and the answer to the one question everyone wants to know: who was her greatest love?The framing of the story reminded me a lot of The Thirteenth Tale. Like that book, in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, a young woman - this time an ambitious journalist called Monique Grant - goes to interview an elderly woman. Unlike The Thirteenth Tale, this elderly woman happens to be one of the most famous actresses in the world.Evelyn Hugo has lived a life in the public eye, but she is full of secrets. Only she knows what happened behind the scenes in her long career of scandals and highly-publicized heartbreaks. Just like the fictional world of the book longed to know the truth-- so did I. Reid and Evelyn's habit of giving you just enough to leave you wanting more was incredibly exciting. Throughout, we are encouraged to wonder why someone like Evelyn Hugo would specifically request a relatively-inexperienced journalist like Monique. Why Monique? What is Evelyn hiding?The more I got to know Evelyn, the more I fell in love with her. She has made a lot of controversial decisions during her career, but she knows it and she also knows she'd probably do it all again. She's played the Hollywood game, dated famous men to further her career, and used her body to get what she wants. She has experienced the full force of the industry's sexism and, in some ways, capitalized on it. She is deeply flawed and aware of it. She has traded important aspects of her identity for more fame, more roles, more money. She was a badass Cuban woman working in an industry that didn't like women to be badass or Cuban. She manipulated and she lied. Despite everything - and because of it - I liked her.I stayed fully engrossed in the story of Evelyn Hugo - and of Monique Grant - from the opening chapters when Evelyn demanded an interview with only Monique, through decades of Hollywood in all its shimmering ugliness, right until the ending's final reveals. I enjoyed every moment.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53701594-nilufer-ozmekik,Rating 5 out of 5,"Best rereading choice for flashback Saturday is re-devouring my all time favorite TJR book! Evelyn Hugo a. k. a. Evelyn Elena Herrera is one of the most portrayed characters, a daughter of Cuban immigrants, raised in poverty. She’s not only beautiful, alluring but there’s something different about her: her energy is vivid, radiating. She knows what she wants for her life and she’s competitive and determined enough how she may get it by leaving her life in Hell’s Kitchen and moving to Los Angeles to become one of the movie stars, dying her hair, exposing her slender body, looking directly at the camera with her almond shaped eyes under her long lashes till the director tells her “cut”.  Now she’s 79, married SEVEN TIMES, a Hollywood legend, ready to share her life story and scandalous secret she kept for years. She befriends 35 years old Monique Grant, an unknown reporter works for “Vivant” in Los Angeles. Even the boss of Monique has no clue why this Hollywood legend demanded to work with her: she could choose someone more experienced, popular, known in the industry.So many question balloons start to fly above our heads:- Why Evelyn wants to talk only Monique and if she doesn’t, the memoir deal will be off?- Why Evelyn married seven times. Did she love any of her husbands? Does she have resentments? Does she suffer from heartbreak? Which one of is the love of her life? - As soon as their interview starts, Evelyn takes her an adventurous train ride with full of juicy, entertaining, heartbreaking, emotional stories starting from glamorous 60’s of La La Land, the productions of her famous movies, how her path crossed with those men, how she saved them and they saved her, how she got hurt, how she shone, how she burned… and eventually a big secret reveals about her life story which will change everything about true identity of Evelyn and the life choices she’s made! It’s brilliant! It’s unputdownable, addictive, heartfelt time travel in Hollywood. Author’s genuine approach to LGBTQ was better reflected than Ryan Murphy’s Hollywood limited series on Netflix. If you haven’t read it, don’t miss out this masterpiece and the best of the best Taylor Jenkins Reid book ( I liked it even more than Daisy Jones and the six) My favorite quotes:“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don’t do that.”“You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until somewhat stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”“Heartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.”""Do you understand what I'm telling you? When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.”“…do yourself a favor and learn to grab life by the balls, dear. Don’t be so tied up in trying to do the right thing when the smart thing is so painfully clear.”"
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48727754-chan,Rating 2 out of 5,"this didn't work for me, but i get how it could work for othersthere's something so glamorous and sad about the golden age of film. throw in a cuban bisexual main character who has to hide her identities and it's a sure fire way to get people intrigued. and i was, throughout the entirety of the book. this book did not lack in keeping my interest.but there were too many things i had issue with. and if i hadn't read all but one of TJR's previous works i might have been able to overlook it. but once i notice a pattern it tends to color my judgment of an author's work. 2 big things for me: writing & relationshipsfirst, i knew going into this that TJR's writing does not work for me. it's not hard to digest which is nice. but the writing is so clear and no frills that it's odd when we get these little nuggets of prescriptive morality. she doesn't want the reader to form their own opinions, she's rather just hold your hand to the ""point."" which happens in almost all of her books. makes for a super quotable book, but for me it felt forced at times.and then the relationships. that was 99% of my issue with this book. it wasn't that Evelyn was a wholly unlikable character, it was her relationship with Celia that grated on my last nerve. again, this is something that is a recurring theme in TJR's book and honestly i hope to god this is not something she has intimate knowledge of. but it seems like the only way she can write relationship problems is by making the love interest awful. they have to have blow out fights, say things they could never take back/should have never been said, leave each other etc.and i'm not saying that this doesn't happen in real life. but after the first time this kind of thing happens, i could like to see the characters grow and learn how to cope like adults. because i'm only 24 and even i don't pull those kinds of stunts with my boyfriend. cause i'm not 16 anymore. and this issue was particularly egregious to me because yes sure the time period was hostile to F/F relationships. but when you have a veritable shit load of money you can cover things up. that wasn't the issue. these two were just too pigheaded to make things work. so. so. irritating.lastlythere is a plot twist that occurs that the end of the book that i really did not appreciate. the twist itself was not bad but given the main character's identity in relation to a deceased person's identity i was honestly appalled. you would think a POC understands POC struggles and wouldn't frame a fellow POC but what do i know.it was just a detail that really rubbed me the wrong way.all that being saidit was really refreshing to see exploration into a time period, culture, and sexuality that is not often explored. i know some people really identify with these characters and i'm glad this book exists. it just did not work for me."

It is a favorite of the year, it will be a favorite of all time. I am wholly enchanted by The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and I will never forget how much I adore this book. CW: domestic abuse, death/grief, homophobia/biphobia, racism abortion & suicide Adult fiction is not typically my cup of tea, especially a combination of historical fiction and contemporary with the amount of long flashbacks (flashbacks: ALSO NOT MY THING). I have no idea how this combination of literary elements I typically do not like consumed my entire being, but it did. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an immensely talented author. Her prose is beautiful, vivid, and descriptive. There isn’t a moment throughout this story where I was bored or underwhelmed. Every second of this book is completely engaging – it was a huge struggle to put the book down. Evelyn Hugo is one of the greatest literary characters I have ever had the pleasure to read from. The exploration of her Cuban heritage and bisexuality is fascinating, especially given the era and her celebrity status. She is one of those intoxicating characters you will never be able to purge from your mind with her strong will, her independence, her strength, her cunning, and her compassion. Evelyn Hugo is unforgettable in my mind and hearing her story was one of the greatest pleasures I think I have ever experienced as a reader.Personally, I didn’t LOVE Monique, though I am always happy to see another biracial main character in literature. I appreciated her contribution to the story as I feel the book would lose some of it’s strength if there was not another character for Evelyn to explain her actions and motivations to and it was just her story, but it’s for that reason that I sometimes felt she was more of a plot device than an individual character. Compared to Evelyn, I just did not care for Monique’s individual life and problems. I enjoyed seeing how Evelyn influenced her life, but her storyline was so drab compared to Evelyn. Edit 4/3/2019 - After a second read, I GREATLY appreciate Monique. Her character is so nuanced and necessary to the story. I totally relinquish much of my initial feelings on her.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of my favorite books OF ALL TIME. I will never forget how in love I am with this story and all the ways it has affected me. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone who is interested in spectacular fiction novels (which should be all of you.)"
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/124132123-lisa-of-troy,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow! This book came in and knocked me off my feet.Monique is working for Vivant, a media company, when she is requested to interview Evelyn Hugo, a very famous movie actress, who has refused to give interviews for years. Evelyn starts to reveal her story to Monique, that life isn't perfect, that people are more than just one thing, that relationships are complicated, the power of forgiveness and reinvention, the idea of family, loss, and accepting the choices of others.This book had such depth and tackled so many issues. One of them was the concept of divorce. Growing up in a Baptist church, divorce was viewed as the ultimate sin. As soon as anyone heard that someone was divorced, they had a permanent scarlet letter attached to them. However, as I matured, life isn't nearly as black and white. Do you really know what happened? Did the man beat this woman and then run off with all of the money, just to teach her a lesson? Why does society still think it is OK to stigmatize divorced people?There were a tremendous amounts of very quotable quotes, and this was one of those rare books that you hope never has to end. ""There are people who see a beautiful flower and rush over to pick it.""This book also tackled some of the issues that women face. ""Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn't know her power, but I'm sick of all that."" ""People don't find it very sympathetic or enduring, a woman who puts herself first."" Overall, this is definitely one of the best books that I have ever read.2024 Reading ScheduleJan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta"
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana,Rating 3 out of 5,"At least I know why Evelyn recruited Monique, the worst journalist of the year, to write her biography. I thought asking astute questions was a part of interviewing a famous person. Apparently not.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a quintessential beach read. The prose is very readable, the plot soapy. You borrow the juiciest, gossipiest parts of Elizabeth Taylor's orMarilyn Monroe's love lives - you get a cracktastick pulp read. It reminded me of the family sagas of the yore, kind of like The Thorn Birds. Only this book needed another 300 pages to dig deeper into the dramas of Evelyn's life and her psyche. I was entertained by the events of Hugo's Hollywood adventures, but ultimately this book lacks depth. Nobody else noticed how superficial everything is in this novel - relationships, emotions, portrayals of race and queerness? The novel is framed as a biography written by a talented up-and-coming jornalist, but reads as if thrown together by an employee of a gossip rag, who included all of the salacious parts of a famous person's life, but none of that person's interiority. Totally see why it's a bestseller. It entertains but never challenges."

I'm sure I'll be the black sheep on this and I'll never understand why. I hated this book and I say that very, very infrequently. I hated every single character with the exception of maybe one but even he turned out to be a huge disappointment eventually. The plot was both simplistic yet beyond difficult to believe. Contrived and cookie cutter are also words that come to mind and will only make sense if you read it, no spoilers here. One major plot point had me eye rolling so hard I was convinced I would have a stroke. I also really, really, really disliked the main romance. I felt there was a huge double standard in how this relationship was portrayed based on the genders of the characters involved. This ""great love"" was abusive, emotionally draining, and not what love is in my opinion. While I am all for authors branching out and trying new kinds of books, this book just did not work for me in the least."

La historia de Evelyn Hugo te quita el aliento. Es intrigante y muy cautivadora; y es de esas de las que simplemente quieres saber MÁS Y MÁS. Yo no podía creer lo inmersa que estaba en la lectura. Solo quería saber más sobre Evelyn Hugo, sus logros, sus triunfos, sus tropiezos, sus motivaciones y, obviamente, sus siete esposos.¿Cómo fue que se casó siete veces? Y aún más importante... ¿quién fue realmente su gran amor?No creo que sea un libro con mucha profundidad, pero sí muy adictivo, hace tiempo que no me la pasaba TAN BIEN y tan picada leyendo una historia. Es que WOW, me sentía dentro del libro, como si Evelyn Hugo fuera un ícono del mundo real y yo fuera su fan y quisiera conocer cada uno de sus secretos. Me encantó, de verdad."

I don’t care about the story. I don’t care about the characters. I just don’t care! I thought it was all me, that I must have a cold heart but then this book happened.I thought this was a literary fiction but it read more like a chick lit. A deep chick lit if that can even be a thing. This book made me realize that it is absolutely not me but them! I cared deeply for the flawed characters in this book.

19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57797254-cindy,Rating 5 out of 5,"A spectacular book well deserving of 5 stars. All of the characters feel like real people: complex, nuanced, and painfully human. Not only is the story incredibly diverse despite its Old Hollywood setting, it also has the best bi representation I've ever seen. The journey through Evelyn Hugo's life is filled with trials and tribulations, love and loss, mistakes and redemption; all the while, Reid does a great job at making you feel all the emotions along the way. I left this book feeling reflective, melancholic, and touched by how many things can happen in life that are both awful and wonderful. Overall, a compelling read that is beautifully put together as it is emotionally satisfying."

“it’s me and you.”“me and you, true blue.”“it’s ok, you can fall down now. i’ll catch you.”“i am absolutely positive that i need you morethan i’ve ever needed another living soul.”
tjr makes me feel like i know these characters, as if they were real and this story is true. i think it’s mainly because we read about evelyn’s life story and not just a small part of it. we see and feel it all, which makes this book feel so real. i can’t say much more about the characters without spoilering too much so the next part is going to be full of spoilers. don’t read any further if you haven’t read the book and are still planning to. 
spoilers
when i read the line “i did not speak to celia for five years after that” my heart broke and bled for them. i was so shocked, i seriously thought they were gonna make up right after their fight. i mean i already was heartbroken the entire time since they couldn’t be who they wanted to be in front of the world, but them losing contact and being alone all over again? my heart bleddon’t even get me started on the part when john was dying and harry had to live without him and then him finding a new love and then died 😭 harry dying was one of the saddest parts in the book. i knew it was coming up but i didn’t expect it to be in an accident. and then the reveal of why monique was chosen for evelyn‘s biography? tjr, you are a genius. seriously. from that moment on my heart wouldn’t stop bleeding. everything that came after was just as heart shattering as harry‘s death. once celia died, i just felt so sad for evelyn. i wanted to hug her even if she had despised me for that. i felt her loneliness through the lines and my eyes wouldn’t stop tearing up. i just wanted them to be a big happy family. when celia and evelyn would stop talking to each other through the years, it made me so emotional.. especially when celia was talking to evelyn through her oscar speech 😭
“and to anyone tempted to kiss the tv tonight,please don’t chip your tooth.”
crying sobbing throwing up banging my head against the table, why can’t they just be happy, let them be happy, please please PLEASE, i need this more than oxygen.
“i can’t live with my heart half-broken all the time.”

“i should have chased her down the street the day she left me. i should have begged her to stay. i should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the hollywood sign and shouted, 'i'm in love with celia st. james!' and let them crucify me for it.”

“you could have been a teacher. i could have been a nurse. we could have made it easier on ourselves that way.” i could feel celia shaking her head next to me. “but that’s not who we are, that’s not who we have ever been or could ever be.”

“all i’ve ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. but you’ve never been mine. not really. i’ve always had to settle for one piece of you. but i can’t do it. i can’t do it, evelyn.”
god i’m just so emotional rn, i really need ten business days to recover if i can recover at all. this book will for sure leave a mark.

Note: If you haven't read the book and don't wanna spoil yourself, please don't read any further. My review is full, or partially, of major and minor spoilers. And it seems like I can not restrain myself of that, lmao.With many playlists on Spotify (wordkey: evelyn hugo), I read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo not knowing (very naive of my part tbh) that my heart was gonna be torn apart like a piece of paper. Huh, who would said it? And even the playlists are masterpieces, and have many Taylor's songs, which iS SO GODDAMN PERFECT.I must warn y'all that I'm still crying.This book is perfect. The writing, the pacing, the characters, the romance, the trageDY, MY FUCKING HEART IS BROKEN, TJR, PLEASE, WHY DID YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO MY SENSITIVE HEART?Anyhow.We have the famous actress and gorgeous woman, Evelyn Hugo, who is known for her many movies back at the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's, and for the scandals of her seven marriages. Evelyn Hugo is announcing that she will auction 12 of her most memorable gowns through Christie’s to raise money for breast cancer research, of which her daughter, Connor, died.Monique Grant is a reporter for the magazine, Vivant, and is specifically by Evelyn Hugo to write her autobiography, but, why Monique? What does she have for someone like the legend Evelyn Hugo wants her to write a book about her life? That's the interesting part.So, Monique goes to Evelyn's aparment and listens her story. From how Evelyn lost her mother and how she swored she would get out of Hell's Kitchen, away from her father and poverty, and because her mother dreamt with became someone famous and live in Hollywood one day. She was born Evelyn Elena Herrera, daughter of Cuban parents, but had to change her name by Evelyn Hugo.She talks about how she made her way to L.A, how much she sacrificed and her husbands, of course.My 3 favorite husbands are: Rex North (he was one of my 3 favorite marriages) to get more money for the movie their starring: Anna Karenina (the gods know how I much love Anna Karenina, so I'd have given my kidney or soul to see that movie). They both agreed to this plan and they're happy this way... Until Rex's pair, Joy, is pregnant and they want to get married. Celia is also married with John Braverman.Harry. hE IS MY PRETTY BABY, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. DKFJDJFGHJFG. I really loved Harry, he and Evelyn are best friends, wich makes their relationship normal and not forced. Evelyn and Celia get back together, and Harry and John are dating, which is cuTE, DON'T TOUCH MY KIDS. Evelyn and Harry have a kid: Connor. And then, everything goes downhill when Evelyn films a movie with her abusive ex-husband, Don Adler, and make a sex scene.Celia is sick and knows she's gonna die, so they form this plan to move to Spain, Evelyn has to marry Celia's brother, Robert (he's the third), so Celia's things belong to her when she dies. They do it, but then, Harry dies in a car accident, where was another man with him. Evelyn is devastated by the loss of her best friend and let me tell you that I cried so much with this.When Celia died, a big part of me died with her. It was heartbreaking.
""I had lost her. My love. My Celia. My soulmate. The woman whose love I'd spent my life earning.
It broke me. I cried until my head hurted.The pacing was amazing. It grab you from the beginning and lemme tell you tHAT THIS WAS ADDICTIVE. I wanted to know more and more, until I got to the end, until there was nothing but my broken heart and my tears falling on my shirt. The characters had an incredible an amazing development. You fall for most of them, and wanna kick many of them too. *cough* Don, Mick, Max. *cough*Evelyn is such a badass woman. A legend. An icon. Not just that. She was a wife, a mother, a lover, a friend. She was not just her talen and her great body.I fell in love with her and her story, with many of her husbands and her wife.My heart is broken tbh. But this book is totally worth of it.I laughed with Evelyn, I cried with and for her, I get angry and sad... I just fell.And the twist for Monique? Ugh, that ruined me as well.All the feelings in this book are deep and explores the sexuality and feelings of a woman who didn't know she could feel more for someone else than a man. And I'm glad that she and Celia got married at the end. :')I didn't know the complexity of this book, and the hype is worth it!!!ALL I KNOW IS THAT I WANT A CELIA ST. JAMES FOR ME, OK?____________________I'm a mess of tears right nowRTC"

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5463364-david-putnam,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. I did not expect to love this book as much as I did. Absolutely LOVED it. This is a story of a powerful love between two women in a time when it was unacceptable. The author has a huge command of language and seamlessly shifts from first person present tense to first person past tense and even to second person. Amazing. I marveled at the writing craft, the storytelling. The language and the passion to communicate the love is mesmerizing. The main character Evelyn Hugo is a swirling whirlwind that pulls everyone that comes near into her vortex. Even though Evelyn Hugo does some truly heinous things, the justification and motivation is clear and we pull full her. The atmosphere, setting and flavor of old Hollywood is captured in just enough detail. The underlying plotline, the mystery that was carried along and always there lurking really paid off in the end. In all the thousands of books I have read in my life time I have found very few that have been able to pay-off with the last line of the book. This author does it with stunning panache and verve. Loved it. For me this book is a true “tear-jerk-er,” as my mother used to call them. (She was married five times, so I might’ve had a little insider experience with Evelyn Hugo. Mom, married three Jim’s, a Bill and a Bob. The third, and last was a Jim and my sisters nicknamed him Jim de jour. Sorry I digress).This one is going up in my top five of the year.Highly recommend this book.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson series."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6020323-monte-price,Rating 1 out of 5,"I just want to preface this review with the fact that this book made me feel things that no other book ever has. I don't think I've ever had as immediate a reaction as I did to reading this book. I feel like my updates have made my distaste for this book pretty evident, but in case it wasn't I'm going to walk through all the things I hated about this book one final time before I try and put as much space between me and this work of fiction as humanly possible.I knew going into the book that Evelyn Hugo was a Latinx character, it wasn't until I started reading though that I discovered our other narrator, Monique, was also a woman of color. [ Don't call her black though, she's biracial. ] And almost immediately I was uncomfortable with this ide. That said I carried on thinking that I was probably just stretching, reaching for things that weren't there. That said I think that the narrative utterly fails at the nuance necessary to tell the story of a Cuban-American finding success in the 50s. Utterly fails to depict the nuance in the way that someone like Evelyn would have to navigate the world, or how her racial identity would have had an impact on most of the things she experienced in life. It's really only brought up at the beginning when she's initially denied roles and Evelyn immediately pivots into this racially ambiguous/spicy white category that she's happy with becuase it ensures her success. That doesn't stop her from later bing mad that her maid doesn't know she's Cuban even though she's actively tried to supress that side of her for literally decades. I won't even get into how the narrative makes Evelyn retiring to Spain to make tortillas her reconnecting with her Cuban roots or how Monique actively distances heself from blackness while never questioning the impact that being raised by a single white mother following the death of her black father might have any role in that. You really mean to tell me that she has memories of her father but not his family? That the first black person she met was a girl in elementary school? Okay. Sidenote Evelyn just randomly dropping that she supported civil rights and MLK Jr towards the end of the book felt totally out of place and while not a big deal that part of the book felt very disconnected from what else was going on.I didn't feel attached to any of the characters really, let alone any of the seven husbands. I have ones I thought were more interesting, but that's only because so did TJR and they were the ones given more time on the page. None of the characters that appear in the novel though are nearly as developed as Evelyn Hugo, something that I think makes it easier for a reader to be drawn to. There is literally no one else. No one is given the time or energy, even the major players in her life. I didn't think that the love story between Evelyn and the person that would be the lover her life was all that compelling if anything I thought that that person was actually lowkey terrible and the romance they shared was almost certainly nothing to write home about.There are a number of deaths in this book, and again, didn't care about any of them.At the end of the day though I did enjoy the voice of Evelyn Hugo, the character to be clear. Though the most revolutionary thing about her is being a bisexual character in their 70s, there's just something about characters like Evelyn that I will always support and that's no different here. Again though it helps that Evelyn is easily the only character crafted with any kind of depth.I can't in good faith recommend that anyone read this book. I got very little enjoyment, but also there is nothing to gain? I realize and appreciate that my thoughts are in the minority here and I in no way feel like my opinion will ever be the one most agree with. If you do decide to pick this up I hope that you are able to enjoy it in ways I couldn't.Also just a warning but this book details incestuous thoughts of child sexual assault, actual child sexual assault/pedophilia, and abuse in general [ definitely physical, emotional up for discussion I'd say ] so just know that if you want to pick this up.2022 re-read thoughtsI wish that I could say that I liked this more the second time, but that would be a lie...Or at least, partly a lie. I don't think that I can raise the rating even if I objectively had a better time reading it knowing the full scope of the story I was going to be getting. Maybe the gut punch of the end of the book being so insensitive being taken out of the equation was enough for me to have a better time, I don't know.I do think that there are elements that work well here. I still think that Evelyn is an interesting character to follow with a very distinctive voice that I would appreciate in the hands of any other author. I feel comfortable saying that because I have enjoyed many a character that share her achetype.For me the ways that race were handled poorly weren't so glaringly annoying this time as much as Celia being a horrible character. From the microaggressions at the first time she and Evelyn have a meal together to the way that she acts for years toward Evelyn. It never comes across as a 'good for her' moment, her standing up for herself... but as shaming Evelyn for doing things that she herself is not doing? Shaming Evelyn for making choices that are good for both of them. I get that communication is hard... but Celia and Evelyn take this to a whole new level. It was childish. It didn't serve love of her life... It didn't serve the one that got away. I deserved better as a reader quite frankly. All of that is to say that the book giving 20ish pages to the explanation as to why Monique was chosen for this opportunity... still by far the worst part of the book. Everything about that getting wrapped up is so rushed. While the whole book feels very surface level, that in particular is damn near unforgivable. Monique deserved better as a character, the readers deserves more, and that TJR thought it was acceptable is pure foolishness.I still think everyone who has wanted to read this has read it at this point... But it really shouldn't be on anyone's tbr. It's definitely not worth the time, even with all the potential this story has."

35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73443415-che,Rating 3 out of 5,"upon reread, i ended up not enjoying this as much. i’ve grown enough since my first read to realize that, as engaging as the story is, it's overall shallow. a lot of the discussions about race and sexuality felt awkward, contrived, or blatantly done for the sake of appearing ‘woke’. the latter i am specifically referring to how poc/biracial people were handled. and although i enjoyed evelyn’s characterization, i heavily disliked how her relationship with celia was handled—considering how big a role it plays, it shifted a lot of my opinions about this book.

36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read Daisy Jones and the Six a couple of months ago. Usually I don’t read two books by the same author this close – mainly so I can spread out my enjoyment of their works. But, to be honest, when I put them both on hold, I didn’t realize they were the same author! Then, the holds come in when they come in . . . so, I have to read them whether I am ready or not. In this case I am definitely overwhelmed with Taylor Jenkins Reid goodness! Spoiled, even!Both of these books have an interview/tell all format. I have to say that I find it to be one of the best formats I have come across recently. Reid turns fiction into non-fiction; making it feel like I am standing in line at the supermarket looking at the most recent shocking celebrity news on the cover of Us or seeing the most recent clickbait links on me feed. I am addicted from the very beginning and I cannot wait for the next scandalous event to occur. And, she really does such a good job making it feel so real – I want to rush off and start Googling these people and then I remember they don’t really exist!This book deals with some very sensitive topics: gender roles (women being treated differently than men), the historical stigma of homosexuality, sexuality in general (i.e. how it used to be shocking for women to be depicted enjoying sex or be blatantly sexual), racism, death/suicide, etc. I know that some of these topics can trigger people, but I think Reid does a great job of interweaving them into the story and showing how each affects the characters. None of it is unnecessary, overdone, or purely for shock value. Basically, Reid is just a fantastic storyteller. She pulls me in and doesn’t let go. I don’t want to put her books down and, when I do, I cannot wait to get back to them. I hope if you try her out, you have the same experiences I did."

If I could recommend only one book for 2018, THIS would be it!THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO not only surpassed my already-lofty expectations, but knocked my proverbial socks off as it shot straight into the open arms of my favorites-shelf. The spirit of this story mirrors its leading lady, Evelyn Hugo, in that it feels gigantic and larger~than~life. I wanted to devour this whole, yet savor it in tiny pieces so I could linger with these characters whom I grew to admire for their extraordinary strengths and unabashed weaknesses. The exceptionally beautiful, world-renowned Evelyn Hugo spent most of her life doing whatever it took to not only become Hollywood’s most iconic female movie star, but to remain planted in the fickle grip of fame and fortune. Evelyn’s now up there in years and wants to tell her story. Not the story the public knows—her real story—the one that’s flooded with glamor, betrayal, secrets and deceit, and one hell of a complicated love story so intensely authentic it dares to bare it all, even the ugly. And I was so desperately in love with this love story.This tale is delivered through the heart and eyes of a woman who's desperate to be seen beyond her celebrity, and it takes an unflinching look at what it means to “make it”: The pride that follows success, and the trail of guilt that lingers for all those who were trampled and used on the way to the top. But beneath the guise of fame, Evelyn's story transcends, and its pieces resonate with all of us, as we can all see a bit of ourselves in her struggles and triumphs; love and loss; pains and pleasures. Evelyn Hugo isn’t just a brilliant fictional character, she is a bold representation of life’s extravagant journey being stripped down to its most basic components—i.e., the only things that actually matter in life. The mystery entwined in this one is taut and sophisticated as it carries the plot full circle, opening our eyes to all that is harsh and all that is sacred. I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed—and my heart was overflowing with love for all of it. Taylor Jenkins Reid masters the art of storytelling and epitomizes the value of honesty, the significance of life, and the beauty in love of all forms. Her writing is polished and engrossing, sophisticated and sharp, witty, fluid, and I can go on…but most importantly, it has a voice that carries its messages straight into the heart of the reader. This story stole my breath from its first pages right up until its final line, which was perhaps my favorite line of the novel. To say I couldn't put this down would be an unjust understatement, because I don’t think I’ll ever truly be able to put this one down.

Evelyn might just be the figurehead of overhyped characters in wlw romance novels. I liked her, sure, but not in the way the author so desperately tried to make her out to be by praising her for this and that instead of showing you why and how Evelyn Hugo has come to be such an amazing and revolutionary woman. The final twist was also very obvious and unexciting. I don't get the hype; we so often find ourselves praising storytellers when in fact we just need some good hecking 
writers.

40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30036082-warda,Rating 4 out of 5,"This has been one of the most well-developed, character driven stories that I’ve read. It’s the type that’ll leave a mark and I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience. Throughout the course of this book, I became enamoured with Evelyn Hugo. She isn’t likeable, but I fell in love her. The whole story felt real. As if I could google one of her movies, and I’d be able to start watching it right away. I was dazzled by her beauty, her bravado. I fell in love with her personality, her ugliness and facade of a life she lived for a while, and how accepting she became of the mistakes she made. She learned from it. This is what you call learning from your mistakes, accepting them and moving on. She didn’t drown in regret, berate herself to the point where one can break oneself down. She dealt with her circumstances in the best way she could back then. She dealt with the cards that she was given in a way that made sense to her alone, but doesn’t condone it either. However, it was her truth and she was unapologetic. There was so much strength in her character that seeped into me. (And Hollywood is just fuckin’ dirty.) I also love the title of this book. I think anyone’s initial reaction is to be slightly shocked. I mean, I believed it. Evelyn Hugo really did marry seven men. But this story highlights that there is always more to someone than what meets the eye and what others may perceive. I don’t care how strong you are in your assumption towards someone. It’s an assumption, a so-called opinion and it’s flimsy at the of the day. The truth is that people are more complex, more layered and human. I think what I was missing though was the same type of intensity that I was feeling whilst reading the first half of the story - though I don’t know how much importance I should place on the ‘missing intensity’. But I also wished that the plot twist was looked at with more depth. It felt like the story ended almost abruptly once that reveal was made and I needed it to be more fleshed out and come round full circle. But other than that, Evelyn Hugo, you are an icon. ———————————The time has come for me to become acquainted with Evelyn Hugo."

42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63164992-grace-burtsbooks,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book aggressively disappointed me. It was a page-turner, I'll give it that, and I really do appreciate everything it stood for; the concept is great but the prose... yikes. I was told this story when I wanted to see it. Reid relies on cliche phrasing much of the time, uses repetition redundantly, and spells out every moment as if the reader is a pre-teen who has just graduated to full-length novels. The timeline is also messy, making the story confusing and the ""plot twist"" in the end more aggravating and underwhelming than shocking. Also, the addition and emphasis on Monique were simply unneeded and boring. All this to say I was entertained by this book and it did make me cry, so it wasn't all bad. I just wish as a reader my comprehension skills were given more credit."

48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 5 out of 5,"Update: $2.99 Kindle special today. This book is TERRIFIC. Men- women - most readers will love it. Great price if you’ve missed it! Evelyn Hugo, born Evelyn Elena Herrera, daughter of Cuban immigrants, grew up poor in Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York City. By 1955 she was in Hollywood. Evelyn is beautiful....as tall and slim as a ballerina, with straight thick eyebrows, oversize almond shape eyes, blonde hair, ( dyed only after she arrives in Hollywood to help her get acting roles), rich, powerful, charming, and exudes a casualness and confidence that makes her all the more radiating. This enchanting lovely woman was humble - down to earth in areas that mattered. Yes, she had seven husbands, too! I was quickly bewitched, fully captivated by Evelyn Hugo. It was her calm wisdom - humble but direct speaking that moved me. She made a distinction about words and how they can be misleading, that made me want to SCREAM OUT AND SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT!!!!!! There was a scene early in the book where it was very clear how one word could induce shame. Words really can hurt and paint evil pictures.... preaching...assumptions before asking.... sarcasm.....etc. I sat and thought about all the times people have used words - not chosen them carefully - and as a result I'd feel hurt or belittled. I'm no better. I also thought about times I did the same to others. Words do hurt and damage the spirit- and the trust of relationships. Ms. Hugo, 79 year old Hollywood legend, handled those 'wrong words' with grace, correcting - teaching- inspiring her new-friend at the time while having compassion for 'herself'. Her purpose was not to hurt her friend who spoke the wrong words - but also not to allow for the misleading word to be, ""misleading"". I started reading 'slower' ( wanting to take in every word out of Evelyn Hugo's mouth), when I realized this Hollywood notable Starlett was sincerely deserving- and worthy of the fans she has -- a celebrity to love!!! I soon discovered this classy gorgeous woman had acute self-awareness, high levels of emotional intelligence, clearly socially aware, and relentlessly lived a full life of many experiences filled with joy and challenges. I felt like I was given a gift - absorbing wisdom from this 79 year old woman. Her life experiences were fascinating, glamorous, scandalous and she herself was .....*extraordinary*. I was learning from this fictional character. Monique Grant, Evelyn's new friend, 35 years old, is an unknown reporter at 'Vivant', in Los Angeles. Evelyn wants Monique to write a book about her life story. Everyone in the journalism community- including Monique's boss, Frankie, were shocked that Evelyn asked for Monique. ONLY Monique -- or no deal at all!!! There are some complications for Monique to figure out with work--plus her husband, David just left her....( not even married a full year), but her life is about to change. Why did Evelyn pick Monique to write her book? We wonder right away!!!We also want to know about Evelyn's life - her husband's - and which one she loved the most. We have many questions as we take this journey-- and it's delicious- with many insightful life lessons and messages.Intimacy - closeness - trust - and real friendship grows as Monique listens to Evelyn's life story. Monique is past the point of remaining objective. She knows how specular of a human being Evelyn is. Against all of her journalistic integrity Monique feels a full range of emotions for her. Monique begins to feel a deep connection and love with Evelyn. There are many juicy stories that get revealed about Evelyn's past marriages, relationships, and movies she stars in, ""Father and Daughter"", ""Little Women"", and the title role in ""Anna Karenina"", however when Evelyn begins to share about her present day life......a secret door becomes unhinged. Both women will have to face the truth together. My final words.... THIS NOVEL IS EARTH SHATTERING FABULOUS- FANTASTIC -WONDERFUL -soooooo GOOD I can barely stand it!!!!!! It's 'not' what you think it is!!!!!!I laughed, I cried, and thankful that this book kept me cozy company while sick in bed!!!!!Many Thanks Atria Books, Netgalley, Jamie, ( my friend who demanded I 'not' wait for the audiobook book as planned - that I RUN over to Netgalley and begged for this book and then drop everything and start reading if given the opportunity -- bless you Jamie Girl.... and last to Taylor Jenkins Reid... ( you really out-did yourself with this novel... amazing!!!! Love You for it!!)"

But after the first few pages I read, I didn’t even want to put it down. I was so entranced by Evelyn’s life and her journey to stardom in Old Hollywood. Usually stories about actors and famous characters don’t appeal to me but this one was different and so well done. The romance in here was just so achingly beautiful but heartbreaking also. It made me cry and feel so many emotions. I just adored Evelyn! She was such an icon. I also adored the other characters so much. I felt so connected to them 😭❤️. I also loved the writing. TJR is such an amazing storyteller and I can’t wait to read more of her books! This was a masterpiece and I just can’t stop thinking about it 💚."

WHAT. ABOUT. IT::FULL REVIEW BELOW ::Folks, this book just came into my home and murdered me personally I’m shaking So, I literally cried for 20 minutes when listening this and not like cute little sniffles either I mean full on tears streaming down my face heaving sobs crying I'm talking having to keep wiping your eyes so you can see. I rarely get truly emotional in books so the fact this book drew that reaction from me is a testament to how fucking damn good it is. Like, please believe the hype peopleLike genuinely, I 100% believe if the fucking bus I was on had just HIT ME that would have been less painful then what happened in the last 20% of this bookanyway, it's like day 8 of trying to write this review but I keep restarting it because I don't know how to communicate how much I just loved this book so much but here goes. 
“It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.” 
this is one of those books that you don't think you'll love so much and then it just surprises you and immediately steals your heart. 
⭐ it's so hard to explain what this book is about because it's so, so much more than I ever expected
On the basic level, it follows Monique, an up and coming journalist who has been invited to write a tell-all about the life of Evelyn Hugo. Evelyn Hugo is a retired Old Hollywood actress, fashion icon, sex symbol and known for her glamorous and scandalous life that included seven different marriages. Evelyn Hugo hasn't done an interview in decades but she insists that Monique write the tell-all and so the story is told both in flashbacks as Evelyn recounts her life through the seven marriages and current time as Monique tries to unravel why Evelyn Hugo, potentially the worlds most famous actress, wants her of all people to write this tell all. And listen, there is so, so much more happening then that but it's so, SO hard to explain. You just have to read it and trust me. Seriously I'm begging you, I'll go full Rumpelstiltskin and trade my first born for everyone to read this book because it is seriously incredible. 
“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”
I think one thing that is so amazing about this is how real it is even though all these characters are fictitious they feel SO REAL. They're so well developed and nuanced. Evelyn Hugo, Harry Cameron, Celia St James and the other characters who appear are incredibly flawed and did some questionable things (especially Evelyn) and I loved that about it so much. The depth that Taylor Jenkins Reid gave these characters made them feel so, so alive. And it also made the pain I felt at their struggles and their joys that much more real. This book absolutely broke me because I was SO, SO invested in these characters. I care about each one of them so much and even though eight days later I MISS them like they're real. I keep wondering what they're up to and how they're feeling. Because Taylor Jenkins Reid sets this book right in the heart of the old Hollywood era, and makes them so compelling and realistic, it honestly feels like they're real actresses and actors and producers and I have to keep reminding myself they're not. That sounds literally ridiculous but thats how WELL WRITTEN these characters are. 
“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.” 
despite the hetero sounding title, this book is very gay a large portion of this is about Evelyn Hugo explaining her love and on/off relationship with fellow actress Celia St. James. And oh my god, I love them so much. And I loved the representation so much.I've mentioned I'm queer here before and this book really had me thinking. The book explores a little what it was like to be queer in Hollywood in this era and what it cost both Evelyn and Harry to hide their relationships. The incorporation of events like the Stonewall riots and the AIDs crisis, and showing how the community reacted to that, was upsetting but important. And it really highlighted how hard it was to be gay or bi or lesbian like these characters at the time. I think that was just something really important in this book and again, brought it up a level from a regular literary fiction book to something a bit more. I also just really loved the bisexual rep. Like, a lot. So many things Evelyn said really hit home for me, and the tensions betwene her and Celia were really relatable because I've experienced that that too. This is not OwnVoices but I did read an article in which Taylor Jenkins Reid explained her research, and you can definitely tell she took her time to gather first person experience, read memoirs and generally research to make sure she was doing this right and she did it SO RIGHT. This is probably one of my favourite lgbtq+ books of all time
“But I like you this way. I like you impure and scrappy and formidable. I like the Evelyn Hugo who sees the world for what it is and then goes out there and wrestles what she wants out of it. So, you know, put whatever label you want on it, just don't change. That would be the real tragedy.”
Okay, I'm getting emotional again so lets leave it here. I love these messy, beautiful characters so much and I just ..... my heart is exploding thinking about all the HAPPINESS they deserved. If you think this book is something you won't like, I did too. I thought there was no way I would care about a literary fiction book focussing on Hollywood but OH. MY. gOD. It's so much more than you think it is and it truly both made and broke my heart. this is one of my favourite 2018 reads and also a new all time favourite, and I am so, so happy it exists."
52,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10067920-samantha,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars but I very well may move it to a 5. This book was surprising, not in a “twist” way but in how so much of it resonated with me. I saw a lot of the “twists” coming but I believe that is entirely the point. It’s not about the twists, it’s about the journey and that is a marker for a great story imo. I desperately hope this gets made into a beautiful film. "

When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is ‘your safe with me’, that’s intimacy”.Este libro es una absoluta maravilla. Me fascina ese momento en el que acabo una historia y me quedo encantada con todo lo que acabo de leer. Sobre todo porque, si les soy sincera, no esperaba que este libro fuera de mi tipo. ¡Y ahora no puedo dejar de pensar en Evelyn Hugo! En Los Siete Maridos de Evelyn Hugo nos topamos con una mujer de lo más peculiar. Evelyn Herrera creció en Hell’s Kitchen, en medio de una familia difícil, así que su sueño siempre fue salir de allí y encontrar el estrellato en Hollywood. Desde muy pequeña siempre supo que estaría dispuesta a hacer lo que fuera con tal de lograr su sueño, y vaya que sí nos lo demuestra a lo largo de las páginas. Muchísimos años después, a punto de cumplir los 80 y habiéndose retirado hace décadas del cine, Evelyn Hugo contacta a Monique Grant, periodista junior de una de las mejores revistas de Nueva York, porque finalmente quiere contar toda la verdad sobre los rumores, sus siete matrimonios y, por encima de todo, sobre el amor de su vida. Así es como empieza un relato apasionante, descarnado y tan real que es imposible que no te toque alguna fibra sensible. La historia de Evelyn Hugo es aquella de las mujeres que quieren triunfar en Hollywood y que han entendido que, lastimosamente, la entrada a este mundo y los grandes papeles no se ganan sólo con talento. Es la historia de una mujer que, dejando de lado los juicios morales, supo jugar las fichas en un gran tablero de ajedrez que le valió la fama y el reconocimiento que siempre quiso. Pero también es la historia de una persona profundamente herida y obligada a esconder la parte de sí misma que más felicidad y satisfacción le generaba. Este es el relato de una mujer fuerte, decidida, tenaz, manipuladora, amorosa y talentosa a más no poder que siempre soñó con ser libre. Al leer este libro me sentí un poco voyeur, pues realmente era una historia que se sentía tremendamente real, a pesar de que Evelyn Hugo no lo sea. Con cada página que pasaba me daba la sensación de estar enterándome del chisme que siempre quise saber, pero nunca lo supe. Taylor Jenkins Reid maneja la narración de tal manera que te enganchas desde el momento cero. Desde las primeras palabras que le dice Evelyn a Monique quieres saber cómo una niña de 14 años logró salir de Hell’s Kitchen y llegar a Los Angeles, cómo consiguió su primer papel, cuál es la verdad sobre cada uno de sus siete matrimonios. Es que quieres saberlo todo sobre una persona que no sabías que existía y que, de hecho, no lo hace. Es un fenómeno tremendo y adictivo. Evelyn Hugo y su vida te seducen de tal manera que es imposible parar de leer. Vamos a ver si puedo hablar de esto con la menor cantidad de spoilers posible. Los Siete Maridos de Evelyn Hugo es un libro LGBTIQA+ y la historia en la que se enmarca esa representación es una de las mejores que he leído. No sólo se abordan ciertas cuestiones como el borrar por completo una identidad, sino también lo difícil que era para las personas del siglo pasado (pre Stonewall) el aceptarse a ellas mismas. Hoy en día leemos historias de aceptación y de coming of age y, aunque no puede ser fácil para nadie salir del closet y aceptar su identidad, imaginen cómo era ese proceso en los años 50s en Estados Unidos, cuando el que a una persona le gustara otra de su mismo sexo se consideraba pecado, enfermedad mental, desviación. Y todos esos matices los encontramos narrados en este libro de una forma magistral. Además de todo esto, la narración de Evelyn logra que amemos y odiemos a los personajes que ella ama y odia. No voy a entrar en detalles, eso sí que serían spoilers, pero creo que nunca voy a olvidar a Celia, a Harry, a Monique, a Connor y a Evelyn misma. Las vidas de estos personajes se entrelazaron en momentos difíciles y felices, en lugares y años en los que no les convenía y en otros en los que sí, pero, al final, crearon una historia memorable y que resonará incluso después de que cierres las páginas del libro. Y me queda hablarles del final… wow. Como todo en Los Siete Maridos de Evelyn Hugo es maravilloso. Cuando todo se cierra y te enteras de aquello que conectaba a Evelyn y a Monique quedas de piedra. Es la última pieza que le faltaba al puzzle para que encajara. Ese momento de la verdad es tan crudo y duro que es, definitivamente, uno de los puntos altos del libro. ¡Y eso que hemos vivido todo el drama y la montaña rusa que ha sido la vida de estrella de Hollywood de Evelyn Hugo! Además, cuando piensas que esa revelación será el punto épico con el que cerrará el libro… bueno, Monique y nosotros como lectores entendemos cómo realmente va a acabar esta historia. Evelyn Hugo siempre tomó fuerte las riendas de su vida y es algo que nunca dejó de hacer. El final es duro, agridulce y muy, muy liberador."

“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.”

 Let me go ahead and say that I had no idea what to expect from this book. When it first released, I remember seeing it everywhere, and I honestly didn’t take any interest in it until I was told about how diverse it was. It’s full of incredible representation: you’ve got bi rep, gay rep, lesbian rep, a Cuban woman, a biracial woman—so when I heard about all of that, I finally decided to give it a try, and I’m so glad that I did, because whatever I thought Evelyn Hugo was about, didn’t hold a candle to the experience of reading it for myself.

“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”

Throughout the entire book, Evelyn is more or less laying her soul bare to Monique, this reporter who she’s asked to write her life story. As this famous actress, Evelyn’s memories are juicy and full of drama, hidden pains and secret triumphs, and most notably, her seven marriages—not one of them having been to the hidden love of her life. Despite the descriptions she gives for judgments she received and the snippets of gossip articles laid out intermittently through the book, Evelyn isn’t ashamed of herself in any way, and it creates this incredibly feminist, sex-positive atmosphere that I could’ve soaked in forever.

“I made it fifty-fifty. Which is about the cruelest thing you can do to someone you love, give them just enough good to make them stick through a hell of a lot of bad.”

Despite Evelyn’s status as this film goddess by this point, she feels so relatable and she manages to work even the celebrity aspects of her life into this narrative that anyone could understand, as she admits to the sins she committed and the lies she told, and even to the baser things like the fact that she realized early on, no amount of fame or fortune would ever truly satisfy a successful actress like herself. She constantly owns up to selfish motives and awful behaviors, yet she’s tremendously likable, and I think that’s a fact that points to how terrific Taylor Jenkins Reid’s storytelling is: because we are hearing everything through Evelyn’s memories, from the mouth of an elderly woman who has settled down and found peace, it makes it difficult to ever blame her for a single crime she committed.

“It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.”

Of course, Evelyn’s not all bad—she overcame circumstances that many people would’ve simply given up under, and yet, she managed to love beautifully and to put her family first at every turn, even if the moves she made to protect them didn’t always make sense on the surface. Whether it’s her hidden love, or her endless commitment to her best friend, or her breathtaking adoration of her daughter, when you reach the end of the story and look back, it’s easy to see that nothing mattered more to Evelyn than the people she held dear, and it makes her feel spectacularly human.

“It’s a hard business, reconciling what the truth used to be with what the truth is now.”

Of course, Evelyn isn’t the only character who’s enjoyable in this book; underneath her memories is the story of Monique, the reporter who’s just trying to find her place in a world that doesn’t like to make room for strong women, much less women of color striking out on their own. She grows so much in a short span of time, and while the circumstances of the writing process aren’t always kind to her, and while she’s never really the star of the show, you can’t help but root for her, too—and everyone else in this complex, layered, masterpiece of a book.

“You have to find a job that makes your heart feel big instead of one that makes it feel small.”

I feel like there is so much more that I want to say, but at the end of the day, it all boils down to one thing: The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of the most brilliant pieces of writing I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It sets itself so solidly apart from anything I’ve ever read that even remotely resembled it, and is probably one of the most powerful, emotional, and incredible things I have ever read. I am forever grateful for each and every one of who you encouraged me to pick it up, and for Taylor Jenkins Reid, the genius behind the pages. I cannot recommend this highly enough.Buddy read with Meisha, Angie, and Delanna! ♥———twitter | booktok | bookstagram | blog"

I enjoy her writing style and her characters. I already read 3 books by her and all of them got 5 stars from me. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is the highest rated book and everyone seems to love it. So I have a pretty high expectation. It is just not for me. I can understand why people loved it. I get it why it ended up being everyone's favorite.Nah, I'm the total opposite of everyone and I'm a picky bitch. :DI didn't feel any connection to everyone. You know what? I say it out loud. I HATE Evelyn. I think she is a horrible person. She is just a disgusting little bitch who wants only money and fame. She always makes the wrong decision, and then she becomes hysterical about it. WTF EVELYN.The ending was weak. I was so happy that I was capable of finishing it. I seriously wanted to DNF it.I'm so angry. I'm not too fond of this storyline but it was some good section. I think the writing style was great but sometimes I got bored because of the repetitive part. Though the audiobook version was amazing, I highly recommend listening to it if you decide to pick this up.I gave it 2 stars. I don't want to see this book again in my life. Nevertheless, I will read TJR's other books in the future."

This was a beautiful and heartbreaking story about love, grief, fame, and being true to yourself. Evelyn Hugo is a famous actress who wants to tell the truth about her life. Monique, a magazine reporter is surprised when Evelyn picks Monique to write her story. Monique hopes that this opportunity will further her career. Evelyn tells her truth from when she moved to Los Angeles to be a famous actress and every heartbreak she face along the way. When Evelyn's story ends Monique realizes that her own life connects with Evelyn's in surprising and heartbreaking ways.I fell in love with Evelyn and Celia and their beautiful love. Evelyn is a complex character in many ways, she is selfish and stubborn, but also resilient, loving, ambitious and strong. She made many mistakes, but it makes her human and very relatable. I also loved Celia, she is smart, caring, but also stubborn and can be naive. I loved Harry, he is strong, caring, kind, and ambitious. I also liked Monique she is ambitious, smart, and resilient. The writing and storytelling in this book was phenomenal. I was completely immersed in the story from the very beginning. I loved learning about about Evelyn from her own perspective. The character development was amazing, I enjoyed seeing a different side of Evelyn, Celia and Monique. The ending was so heartbreaking and shocking. This book will stay in my heart for a very long time."

I've loved every book I've read by Jenkins Reid, but I was blown away by both the expansiveness and intimacy of this one. I'm not sure how she did, but there are a dozen memorable, fully fleshed characters in this, and even while knowing approximately where this was going (there are seven husbands; you know the story won't stop at number six), I couldn't stop reading it. I loved how complex and thorny Evelyn was. I loved that we were expected to love, admire, or feel whatever else for her while really being shown what a thoroughly normal person she is. Not to say she isn't an extraordinary characters, because she is, but to see so deep down into her, to all of her ugliest and most relatable thoughts, to see her humanity on every level--this book is just so rare. I'm sure you've already read it, but if you haven't, do."

I had learned all too well that pain was sometimes stronger than the need to keep up appearances.

You can’t deny the fact that The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of the most praised books in this community, and, generally, around the book community, and for quite good reason. There's never a day this book doesn’t pop up in my Goodreads feed. There's even a compilation of Booktube going crazy over this, and I finally get it.There isn't a lot I could say about this that hasn't been said, but I'll try.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo follows Cuban-American Evelyn Herrera, who later changes her name to Evelyn Hugo, telling us her story with a set of recordings by Monique Grant. Monique is a writer for Vacant, and when Evelyn herself says she will not let anyone interview her unless it's Monique, she knows it's a big deal. In her process of interviewing Evelyn, she tells her everything. And I mean, everything, starting off when she was a little girl living in Hell's Kitchen to becoming Hollywood's highest-paid actress. And of course, she tells everyone the journey of being married seven times, to seven different husbands. She tells Monique her journey of becoming one of the most iconic women. She tells the world her secrets. But as Evelyn is telling Monique everything the world is dying to know, she begins to see that there is more that connects the two than just an interview.

When you dig just the tiniest bit beneath the surface, everyone's love life is original and interesting and nuanced and defies any easy definition.

I may still be too young to say, but marriage sounds too complex, responsible, stressful, and quite . . . boring, even. While I hear about marriages completing 50 or more years, and while it sounds adorable and beautiful, marriage sounds too complicated for me. I look at my parents marriage as an example and ask myself ”Do I want that?” Don’t get me wrong. They’re in a healthy relationship, but sometimes it feels as if there could be more.My dad reminds me of something we both see a lot in people we know. The couple is doing perfectly fine, and it isn’t until they marry that they begin to see each other’s true colors. Years pass, years of love and lust, years of denial and arguments, and it leads to divorcement. We’ve heard too many stories of the same reasons, and my dad reminds me of why marriage was never something he wanted. Marriage is such a complicated thing, and I see it as both an issue and a desire. Reading about Evelyn’s 7 different marriage experiences reminds me why I’m scared of marriage. How do you know the person you’re marrying is the one? Do you ever know? Or do you only desire the feeling of marriage? Are you marrying out of love, or are you marrying because you need to? What about the promises made, the vows you said? Does all that not mean anything anymore once the first broken promise settles in? People marry for different reasons, but are all those reasons worth it? This will be something I will never know, or maybe, I will. I can’t predict my future and say, but I do know that it’s a scary thing.

Some marriages aren't really that great. Some loves aren't all-encompassing. Sometimes you separate because you weren't that good together to begin with. Sometimes divorce isn't an earth-shattering loss. Sometimes it's just two people waking up out of a fog.

Evelyn is described, by many, as complex and unapologetic, and I think that's a fair and perfect description for her character. She makes decisions that the reader will hate, but since she's telling Monique (and us) her story, and is letting us know what and why led to that decision-making, it's difficult to blame her for it. To be honest, Evelyn is irritable. She's sour from the beginning, and as we meet her with Monique, we can already tell that she is confident, even if some would take her as selfish. But Evelyn is just that: confident. She knows this, and she's not afraid to admit it. But her confidence is what brings the people to think differently about her. Evelyn is unapologetic in the sense that she won't take no for an answer, and she will decide on what she will act on, perform, and do. I say Evelyn is a character some may find hating themselves for loving her because of her attitude. She’s sharp-tongued, quick to defend herself, and will not take no for an answer. But I think that is also why many love her. She knows her chances of getting what she wants, and when the opportunities present themselves, she takes the advantage of them. She knows about her beauty, and she uses it as an advantage. She knows the effect she has on men and how much power she holds over them, so she uses that part of herself to earn herself promotion, advertisement, and, of course, lust. Evelyn’s decision-making comes to make sense the more we meet her, and as she unfolds her story to Monique, so many more things start making sense. Evelyn is sexualized since the beginning, and she's only seen for her body. She knows this, and she holds it to be a part of her. She's not seen for the real person she is. She hides every part of herself, not only her love for her wife, but her personal identity: a bisexual Cuban woman.I think what made Evelyn feel more real to me was how easy she trusted people, especially with herself. She offered herself, but she did it because she knew if she didn't, she wouldn't manage to continue going forward. She had her epiphanies too late into the lives of the people she loved, and it shows the message of how short life is and how you’ll regret the time you spent adapting to societal norms instead of showing everyone the real you. The world is a scary place, and sometimes, all you can think of is pleasing the world while ignoring your own self. You put the world, the audience, before you, and it starts to make you realize how you were doing everything because of them, never because of you.While homophobia is never actually explained nor shown in the book, the reader can sense it with how Evelyn and Celia react to their relationship. When you look back at the 80s, you can’t really find the best support of the LGTBQ+ community, let alone the 70s, 60s, and 50s, which was why I supported Evelyn in everything she did. I was mad at myself for sympathizing with Evelyn, but how could I not? I didn’t understand Evelyn, and couldn’t grasp the fact that she wouldn’t “come out” and be unafraid like Celia, but it’s more than that. It isn’t easy being part of the LGBTQ+ community now, even in 2021, so we can only imagine how people in the 50s and later on felt. While there have been incredible and numerous changes, discrimination and harassment continue.Celia and Evelyn have to hide themselves and their relationship, and it doesn’t take until 2017 for Evelyn to finally tell someone else that Celia was the love of her life, for her to admit she was in love with a woman. They regret the time they didn’t spend together, the time they spent separated, mad at each other, but just as Evelyn reassured Celia that it wasn’t her fault, it really wasn’t. The two put everything at stake when being together, but their entire life would be at risk. People would talk, they would judge, and they would assume. Word would spread easily, and the two would be placed in different situations of both judgment and support.I feel like the relationship between Celia and Evelyn is one of the most difficult and beautiful relationships I’ve read about, simply because of the portrayal of it. The two ache and yearn for each other, and the reader aches and yearns for them to be together. 

I have been married seven times, and never once has it felt half as right as this. I think that loving you has been the truest thing about me.

But, while Evelyn found herself in love with Celia, Celia was also a friend of Evelyn, and the second-chance family Evelyn found herself in with her, Harry, and Connor, her daughter, was beautiful but sad to witness developing. Evelyn thought she had it all: fame, money, a mansion. She was a legend and icon everywhere she stepped foot in, but her human connection to the most important people in her life was slowly disappearing. Evelyn’s been through a lot, especially with her marriages, and it makes a huge impact on who she becomes in the future.The only problem I found in this was the plot twist that connected Monique and Evelyn in ways some may have not expected. I honestly found it to be unnecessary, if I’m being honest. I didn’t think it added much emotion to the story. I feel like the author could have taken a different approach to adding a twist to the story. All in all, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is worth the hype. It's the book every daughter and mom are talking about for good reason. It's full of love and lust, heartbreak, and decisions that could lead you to lose everyone you love most in your life. It's a reminder to live your life for yourself, not for others.I may have not exactly loved this as much as I thought I would, but it's still a book I would recommend to people.

To Evelyn. Who has lit up every goddamn room she ever walked into. And who, day after day, makes us feel like we're living in a dream.

66,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 starsDon't read this book on your period. Just don't. Take my advice. Spare yourself the grief and agony.Every time I closed this book and my brain snapped back to the present, it took me a couple of seconds to remember that Evelyn isn’t a real person. A fictional biography is such a genius idea, and it was done so expertly. I have zero interest in movies or Hollywood (cite literally any tweet about me hating watching movies and not caring about actors), but this book and the setting and characters enchanted me. I wanted to turn on La Vie En Rose in the background as I read it just to get in the Mood.This is the first book I’ve read in a while where I sat and read without touching my phone for 2+ hours, praying that time would pass slower so I could fit in more pages before I had to go to sleep. Part of why I was so addicted is because the writing of this book just demands attention. It’s flowing almost to the point of conversational, more like a memoir than a novel. And although I flew through the prose, part of me questions whether the flashback sections resemble the tone and voice of an older Hollywood star. A lot of the lingo and style of relating a story seemed modern, and maybe I’m just overthinking, but it took away a bit from the authenticity of the story for me. Maybe it would have worked better being told in third person as if it were Monique's writing, but something about the voice of Evelyn's memories didn't sit right with me.I like how this book uses the perspective of hindsight. Evelyn using her wisdom to call out when she was being mistreated and all the unjust and toxic things that occurred to her constructed a powerful narrative. I applaud this book talking about feminism, abusive relationships, abortions, and bisexual erasure, among plenty other things. I can see why it's highly praised in that respect. The discussion of moral greyness and the corruption and scheming of Hollywood and fame and unabashed conceit and fame was also fascinating. I love the light in which it was painted. It was very take it or leave it, which was so different because usually, books do the most to try and convince you of a character being starkly good or bad. This book let you assume whatever you wanted to about the characters, which I respected.Lastly, the most satisfying thing about this book is watching the growth of Monique alongside Evelyn telling her story. Being honest, I didn't think I was going to like Evelyn at first, but I realized the same quality that makes her a rude and off-putting character also makes her powerful and memorable. I grew to love her snark and confrontational dialogue, even though I would likely be terrified of her in person.It's hard to wrap up this review because I want to say that I loved it as much as everyone else, but I can't quite put my finger on why it wasn't a full five stars. Still, I highly recommend it."
67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/136709178-ishika,Rating 3 out of 5,"Buddy read with my lovely friends Ananya, Bhavya, Stuti, Aashi, Bonnie and Aazra.Some marriages aren’t really that great. Some loves aren’t all-encompassing. Sometimes you separate because you weren’t that good together to begin with. Sometimes divorce isn’t an earth-shattering loss. Sometimes it’s just two people waking up out of a fog.Would you desire someone who used her attractiveness and body to achieve her goals? No you won't. You call her a whore. You call her her a slut. Now would you like someone who raped or sexually, mentally abuse a women but infront of someone he becomes the beloved of everyone just because he's handsome? Maybe you would because you can't say anything about the character of a person by looking at his face. But we do judge women automatically by looking at the clothes she wear, the no. of man she dates (or marries).This story is not about the ""seven husbands"" of Evelyn. It's about a motherless girl's journey from rags to riches. She might have used her body to get roles in movies, however it was her talent which made her famous and successful. Her husbands might have been seven in number but she loved only one person. It would look like that she changed her husbands like the same way my mood changes, but I feel that it was her husbands who made her stronger and more bolder. Let's meet her husbands one by one (I might have forgotten their surnames so forgive me). And please don't read further if you don't want the book to be spoiled.1. ERNIE: All I would like to say is: ""Poor Ernie Diaz"". 2. DON ADLER: The worst character in the entire book. “If Don doesn’t want you, he doesn’t want anyone else to have you."" He thought he could destroy Evelyn's career? Ha! The joke's on him.3. MICA: I still don't know if I like him or not. 4.REX: I liked him. He was the third nicest husband iykwim.5. HARRY: To be honest I strongly disliked him in the beginning however my views for him changed as the plot moved on. Guess who cried when he died? T.T6. MAX: I hate him. He only married E. for her beauty and fame and not for her love. Go to hell man :)7. ROBERT: I love him. Yup he was the 2nd best husband.8. CELIA: I didn't like her very much due to some reasons I've written belowI previously rated it 4 stars but after reading Malibh Rising I don't think this book deserves 4 stars. REASON 1: I didn't like how this book portrayed men. Look I'm a big proponent of feminism, but I despise it when males are portrayed as the worst creatures on the planet. I want women to be treated equally to men, but it does not necessitate portraying males as inferior to women. Consider the disparity that will exist between us, the women who are striving for fair treatment, and them. Gay males were the only ones who didn't want to get inside Evelyn's pants. This was what I felt while reading the book.I don’t think she liked me working with my ex-husband every day. I don’t think she liked me working with Max Girard every day. I don’t think she liked my long hours. And I got the impression that while she loved my baby girl, babysitting wasn’t exactly her idea of a good time.REASON 2: Celia was never one of my favourites. She was too self-conscious about Evelyn's feelings for her. She needed to be told that she was loved all of the time. She grew excessively envious of any man who came into contact with E. For the love of God, she became envious of a gay man. She also didn't treat E. with the respect she deserved. E. wanted to protect them both from the media, which could ruin their lives, so she called her a whore. She never tried to see things from E.'s point of view.I'm at a loss for words when it comes to Monique. We didn't got to spend much time with her. I wanted a little more from her point of view.Finally I would like to say is that I love Evelyn. You can't even try to hate her. I cried at the end (Which isn't something very new because I usually cry after completing every emotional book).""I hate Evelyn, but I think I like her very much. I wish she had never existed, and yet I can’t help but admire her a great deal."""
68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6431467-s-penkevich,Rating 4 out of 5,"When I die, feel free to use my body to fashion a front-page celebrity scandal and let not the drama of my death be the death of my drama. There are few better ways to examine the depths of drama than a novel about Hollywood and Taylor Jenkins Reid transports readers back into the glamor and glitz of Hollywood’s golden era in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo for a story about scandals, successes, sexuality and a series of seven husbands. Told as an interview from Evelyn in her twilight days, the novel charts a course through her career and personal relationship, showing not only the woman behind the curtain but also the oppressive burdens of conforming to social demands and living behind the mask of a highly calculated identity. This book is as engaging as a blockbuster hit, moving through an episodic structure framed by each of her marriages that serve as a front to hide her true self and sexuality. Yet can her love for Celia flourish when it must be hidden in shadows? The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo has an excellent cast of characters and often functions as a character study in a way that respects how people are complex and full of contradiction. This is a rather empathetic and moving look at mid-century queer identities, making for a potent novel on ambition, authenticity and love caught in the maelstrom of fame and power dynamics of a society that can propel you to the top but tear you to shreds if you step outside the facades of self which become nothing more than gilded cages. ‘When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.’Thank you to Luh for the recommendation because this was such a delightful and gripping read. I tore through this in a day, pulled along by Reid’s infectious way of unleashing surprising revelations while teasing a fuller understanding still hidden in the shadows. Which is exactly the experience of Monique, the journalist Evelyn contacts after reading her article on assisted suicide, being told these tales and wondering ‘is Evelyn Hugo going to tell me just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat but never enough to truly reveal anything?’ Little does Monique know that behind Evelyn’s spectacle of false self hide secrets that can change everything Monique knows about her own life forever. It all feels particularly vibrant in the historical setting—I love the inclusion of news articles that help ground it but also give an external view of Evelyn's image—which is all bolstered by Evelyn being inspired by the lives of real woman much in the way that I found Daisy Jones & the Six to be so engrossingly immersed in the people and period of its setting. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Reid says that Evelyn was most notably inspired by actress Elizabeth Taylor,who was married 8 times to 7 men.‘You can’t write about an iconic Hollywood star of the sixties without bumping up against Elizabeth Taylor. And, obviously, the many marriages is a very striking thing Evelyn and Liz have in common. I tried to craft a realistic portrayal of a deeply glamorous and scandalous woman. And when you do that, you’re bound to hit some of the same beats as the great Elizabeth Taylor.’Though Reid has also revealed that the story is inspired by Ava Gardner’s life confession being told to a journalist who would publish Ava Gardner: The Secret Conversations as well as Rita Hayworth and her multiple marriages. What works so wonderfully here is that Reid’s story tells a side of 1960s Hollywood that was often brushed under the rug, focusing the novel on queer relationships with a diverse cast of characters.‘If I want things to change, I have to change how I do things. And probably drastically.’The story unfolds split into segments titled after judgemental nicknames for the titular 7 husbands which are very quickly revealed to be marriages serving Evelyn’s overall facade. Every aspect of her public image is an acutely coordinated mask, from her dyed-blonde hair to hide her Cuban heritage in a society that rejects anything other than whiteness to marriages to co-stars that help drive ticket sales, help her reach her larger goals, or redirect attention away from her actual private life. That she is an actress by trade feels a natural extension to her abilities as a master manipulator, understanding that beauty and sex are keys that can unlock many doors. Though one should never mistake this as Evelyn holding power over others, as Reid is careful to point out that the industry is gatekept by men and society at large prioritizes patriarchy. Reid excels at historical fiction that reframes the narratives on glamorous lifestyles to show the mechanisms of misogyny and gatekeeping functioning behind the scenes in order to present patriarchy as if it were the natural order and not highly coordinated (like Evelyn’s own image), which was an aspect I greatly enjoyed in Daisy Jones & The Six as well. Even if one might accuse Evelyn as using beauty to get ahead, it is beauty gazed in service to men’s desires. As Tressie McMillan Cottom discusses in her book Thick: And Other Essays: 'Beauty is not good capital. It compounds the oppression of gender. It constrains those who identify as women against their will. It costs money and demands money. It colonizes. It hurts. It is painful. It can never be fully satisfied. It is not useful for human flourishing. Beauty is, like all capital, merely valuable.'Evelyn knows this and is able to harness it in order to survive, with warnings like ‘be wary of men with something to prove,’ while knowing these are also the sort of men that can be manipulated if them using Evelyn as an accessory for their image can be employed to also serve Evelyn’s needs. It also shows that the world will steamroll those who don’t stick up for themselves and that those who are trying to prove themselves and have an unearned sense of deserving (like, just being a man in a world that caters to you) sometimes put their morality on mute in order to throw people under the proverbial bus or into the fire to suit their needs.‘My mother raised me to be polite, to be demure. I have long operated under the idea that civility is subservience. But it hasn't gotten me very far, that type of kindness. The world respects people who think they should be running it.’The novel does frequently remind us that society puts white, cis, hetero men on a pedestal at the exclusion and often oppression of all others. This is message behind great jabs like ‘make them pay you what they would pay a white man,’ and the frustration fueling lines like ‘you wonder what it must be like to be a man, to be so confident that the final say is yours.’ Still it is well crafted how Evelyn learns to take control over her sexuality and orchestrate the press around it in ways that she decides but we see how this facade hides a lot of pain, most notably the attention to the make-up Evelyn wears to cover up the bruises and abuses of Don. Later in life Evelyn is frustrated that people such as Max only love her or regard her as a sex symbol rather than a person.'Did I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.'The truth behind Evelyn’s social mask is that she is in love with Celia, a truth that could destroy both of their careers in a time of rampant homophobia. Queer lives are centered in this book, with Harry being a major player as well, and his near inability to vocalize his sexuality to Evelyn is symbolic of how the harsh treatment of LGBTQ+ identities often leads to self-denial or other struggles from either fear or internalized homophobia. Outing a person is used as a weapon, which is evinced when Ruby outing Celia to Evelyn is meant to tarnish her reputation and crumble her career. A warning that the characters read loud and clear about what is at stake just for being themselves. Reid has plenty of clever symbolism in the novel and the literary references in these character's acting roles emphasize the many themes. There is Celia and Evelyn's role in an adaptation of Little Women, a novel that emphasizes the struggles of women's ambitions in a world that disregards women. Evelyn's role as Jo highlights that Evelyn prioritizes ambition over happiness (also, perhaps, that Jo is sometimes theorized to be a lesbian who must marry a man because *does air quotes while rolling eyes* society). Celia cast as Beth is also apt, as Connor points out Beth just wants everyone to be happy and Celia tends to prioritize Evelyn's happiness over her own. Later Evelyn stars in an adaptation of Anna Karenina which nudges the themes of unhappy marriage, affairs, and suicide. ‘People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.’Perhaps the most powerful imagery in the novel, however, comes when Evelyn chips her tooth kissing the television screen when Celia wins her Oscar. It is a potent moment about how her true desire would be a social blemish far greater than the now blemish on her perfect teeth and smile. Though I have to saw the twist at the ending was great. I mean aJawMeetFloorkind of good. I’ve seen people make the argument they say it coming so it wasn’t good but I think that is beside the point—it was so tragic and powerful because its indicative of all the ways the gatekeeping and homophobia of society means you aren’t safe even in death. Anyways, I dug it and really brings the whole book to a close in a way where the support beams of facades have been pulled and all theyve held up comes crumbling down. Nailed it, Reid.'And to be honest, I like how calculating and awful you kind of are.'Though another aspect I really enjoyed was the way Reid is careful to show people as dynamic individuals and how everyone has flaws and struggles and that is just what being human is about. People are complex, people contain multitudes. We see how it is sometimes difficult to even know what the right choices are, or how what needs to be done for a career or ambition can be harmful to one’s personal life or how a morally grey situation can have definitive moral repercussions.‘No one is just a victim or a victor. Everyone is somewhere in between. People who go around casting themselves as one or the other are not only kidding themselves, but they’re also painfully unoriginal.’I like this idea that looking at people in terms of black and white is scoffed at as just another form of posturing, or like another form of the masks people live behind in this novel. I like too how Reid uses this as a commentary on society wanting to fit people in boxes but these boxes can never contain all of a self. Even sexuality as Evelyn points out saying ‘I'm bisexual. Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box.’ I also REALLY appreciated the bisexual representation, more of us please!‘And I didn’t say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don’t feel regret for the things I’ve done – at least, not the things you might expect – despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.’For those looking for a rip-roaring read of social criticisms or historical fiction that centers the human narrative over the historical features, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a great choice. I burned through this with an intensity as if I had to match the intensity with which Evelyn lived her life. The prose style helps, being pretty simple in the sort of way that lends itself to a cavalcade of quotable lines and while I didn’t think I needed another novel via interview style, it all made it more engaging. A quick but powerful novel that reminds us that people of color and LGBTQ+ people have always been a part of history even if they are brushed under the rug. A delightful book, I’ve come to quite enjoy Taylor Jenkins Reid.4.5/5‘ I have been married seven times, and never once has it felt half as right as this. I think that loving you has been the truest thing about me.’"

71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52710209-lex-kent,Rating 5 out of 5,"I can’t believe I am saying this but this is my 1,500 review on Goodreads! (Skip down two paragraphs if you want to start the actual review) If you would have told me back in early 2016, when I first joined Goodreads, that I would write this many reviews I would have laughed hysterically. I joined this site because my memory is like a sieve and I could not keep track of all the books I read. But the real reason I stayed and reached 1,500 is because of the people on this site. While many people have come and gone over the years, this little corner of Goodreads (fans of LGBTQ+ fiction) have just been so wonderfully kind and fun to be a part of. I just want to thank all of my friends and followers, and everyone who has taken the time to comment or even like one of my reviews. I honestly would not keep writing these reviews without you all. You make Goodreads a place that I want to keep coming back to and be a part of. And a big thank you to everyone who rates and or reviews books too. I like reading reviews and it’s been fun watching my to read list grow into a giant from the books you all have recommended over the years. I don’t know if I will make it to 2,000 reviews. It would take me years to hit that number and we all know life gets in the way, so I’m going to enjoy this 1,500 review milestone and you all have my sincere thanks.Over the past few weeks I’ve been thinking about what to read as my 1,500 book review. I wanted a book that would feel special and that would hopefully be a book I really liked or even loved. It’s really hard to get a sure thing when it comes to books since we all have such personal tastes. I figured I had to go for a hype book, but choosing this particular one was not easy. I think a book can have almost too much hype and I felt like this book was in that territory for me. It’s weird, but if everyone tells me to do something, I start thinking I don’t want to do it. That’s what happened with Evelyn Hugo. Everyone told me to read this, everyone told me I would love it, and I started to pull back from it. Plus, it didn’t help that an ex-girlfriend of mine was obsessed with this book –and had really pushed it on me to read when we were together- so it just tainted it even more. But time passed and I still kept seeing this book on my feed as people keep reading it and loving it. This summer was truly rare if I could go even a week without seeing something about this book, so it has never left my mind. And then a few weeks ago I was listening to a podcast of favorite summer reads and once again, there was Evelyn Hugo. It just seems sort of like fate that a book I should have read years ago, was going to be my 1,500 review. Well here it is:There has been a ton of reviews for this book already so I’m just going to comment on a few things that stuck-out to me. I think what surprised me the most was my feelings about Evelyn Hugo. This book is so talked about that I knew that many readers did not like Evelyn or even downright hated her character. I was surprised that I didn’t feel the same way. I felt like I understood her and dare I say I even liked Evelyn a bit. Yes, she takes advantage of people and did whatever it took to protect her family, but it always seemed true to her character. I think it is a testament to Reid’s writing that I was able to sympathize with Evelyn (although Evelyn would have hated to have been sympathized) and that I clearly understood where her motivations where coming from. Evelyn is a very interesting character that is easy to dislike, but she ended up being so well written that I’m kind of team Evelyn anyway. I do have to mention that some of the big plot points are a bit predictable. It is not had to guess how the main love story arc will flow and the main twists are pretty obvious. While this might have normally bothered me, at the end of the day I honestly didn’t care. This book was hearty in length, so it took me two sittings to finish, but that was only because I had to stop reading at 4am to go to sleep. I would have kept reading because I was so engrossed in this world. Not only was I completely into Evelyn’s story, I liked the smaller current story of the author writing her book. There were so many times that this book could have slow-down and dragged, but it never felt like that to me. Once I started reading I was hooked, and I didn’t care one bit if some of it was a bit predictable. Reid writes so well that it just didn’t matter. I think it is obvious from all the other reviews but this is a tear-jerker at times. At first I was actually surprised how much I was reading and never needed a tissue, well that was true for the first two thirds. Once the last third starts, I picked the tissues up and didn’t put them down for the rest of the book. This book is very sad, and it almost felt too sad and too much at one point, but I was still okay with that part of the story. I was satisfied with how Evelyn’s love story was written which was a big part of enjoying the story for me. So sad yes, but I think the story is still fulfilling for the reader.This ended up being the right pick for a review that means a lot to me. I was hoping for at least a good 4 star read, but this was an excellent 5 star read so I could not be happier. This really was a classic Hollywood drama at its best, but the fact the main character was a bisexual woman made it even better. Reid is a very talented writer and even though some of her other books might not fall into my preferred genres, I will still have to read more by her. This is a book extremely easy to recommend, just have the tissues ready."
72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24156068-christina-loeffler,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 glamorous, glitzy, enamored beyond all reason stars!!!Full review featured on my blog Recipe & a Read along with a recipe for Caldo Gallego soup!My life has been broken up into two segments: before Evelyn and after.Where do I even start with this? If all of my enthusiasm and relentless energy could be compressed into a grenade I would pull the pin out for The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and burst into a show of sparkles and champagne bubbles. I don't even know how to concisely put into words how much this book did the damn thing for me.So do yourself a favor and learn how to grab life by the balls, dear. Don't be so tied up in trying to do the right thing when the smart thing is so painfully clear.Evelyn Hugo. She's a magnetic, luscious, complicated and layered character beyond all reason. How Reid was able to fit such a huge personality into only 386 pages is honestly beyond me. I didn't just want to read about Evelyn, I wanted to know her. I want to bask in her greatness, revel in her strengths and ponder her weaknesses and lessons with her.It's always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.Evelyn Hugo. She spent her entire life working tirelessly and mercilessly to fight her way to the top of the food chain during the Golden Age of Hollywood. She's nearing the end of her life and she's finally ready to tell all about her triumphs and failures and she chooses a down-on-her-luck, little-known, surprise-to-everyone writer named Monique Grant to tell that story.All I've ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. But you've never been mine. Not really. I've always had to settle for one piece of you. While the world gets the other half. I don't blame you. It doesn't make me stop loving you. But I can't do it. I can't do it, Evelyn. I can't live with my heart half-broken all the time.EVELYN FREAKIN' HUGO. Her story resonated with me and spoke lessons to me I didn't even realize I needed. Evelyn simply wants what most of us do, she wants to be seen. It is an ache within in her that transcends the words on the page and nestles itself into the heart of the reader.While this is told from Monique's POV, Evelyn is the one weaving the tale. When Monique learns that Evelyn is ready to give a tell-all interview to her and her alone we see many parallels between these two women. Monique has her own lessons to learn, her own battles to fight and Evelyn unknowingly turns into a guiding light in Monique's life.Why, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn't like to to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?It was truly effortless to love Evelyn and this cast of characters. At it’s heart this is a love story, a tale of redemption and a saga of loss and heartbreak. It tackles an insane amount of timely topics with a deft and delicate hand. Reid has truly outdone herself. This book takes homophobia, racism, sexism, trauma, abuse and a whole lot more and highlights and honors the struggles of those experiencing these ugly truths of our society.This book. Who am I now? What do I do with my life in this new stage of After Evelyn? This is easily the newest member of my favorites shelf and my new go-to recommendation for other readers. This book isn't hyped, it's properly praised for the literary masterpiece it is. I'm now facing one of the worst book hangovers of my life because I'm not ready to say goodbye to Evelyn and her story. Reid crafted Evelyn’s character in a way that those around her could never get enough and she did so in such a spectacularly efficient fashion that readers wont be able to either. Evelyn always leaves you hoping you'll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.Pick it up, I suggest this for anyone with the capability of reading or absorbing literature through any medium. I'll just be over here, weeping quietly at the beauty and magnificence that was this story."
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57236678-iryna-book-and-sword,Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5/5 stars Enjoyed the diversity - hated pretty much everything else. I'm going to tell myself that this is the last time I'm reading hyped book that everybody absolutely loved, but we all know it isn't true and I will never learn. ​I bought the book because of the raving reviews and then it just kinda sat on my shelf for a couple of weeks, because I had an inkling that I wasn't going to like it. And look, I was correct. At least I know myself. Main reason for me suspecting from the bat that I won't like this was the setting - I can't think of something I care less about than Hollywood (old Hollywood in this case). That's just not my thing. And while my opinion about the ""stars"" who would do anything (and I mean anything) just to get a little bit of spotlight was already very low, this book lowered it even more. It's been a couple of days since I've read this, so my feelings aren't as angry as they were right after I finished it - so maybe this review won't be a disaster after all. But what used to be a very coherent and informative review in my head is now merely a half remembered ramble. I guess saying that everybody in this book is a horrible human being is a good place to start as any. Except Harry and Monique's mother. Everybody else is honestly barely a human, they are quite the monsters. Starting obviously with Evelyn herself. I'm thinking that the idea of this book was to show that even people like Evelyn are real, raw and as vulnerable as anybody else. I think. Because I did not get that. If I was supposed to feel any pity whatsoever towards her - I didn't. I honestly think that she deserved what came to her.And I love morally grey characters. They are probably the most interesting ones to read and ""dissect"" for me. But, Evelyn is not morally a grey character, in my opinion. Because morally grey characters do wrong things mostly for the very right reasons. Or do good things for wrong reasons - Evelyn did everything in her life for one reason and one reason only (pardon, two reasons haha) - fame and money. Even if she claimed otherwise, it was always about fame and money. It's hard to talk about this book without smiling anything, so !!!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!. !!!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!. !!!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!. Evelyn is very flaky as a character. I don't know if it was done on purpose, or if she just wasn't fully developed as a character. As she is telling her story she makes both statements which contradict one another a 100 percent. Evelyn says that she learned her from mistakes and she knows that she did everything wrong and that she chose all the wrong things to pursue in life, while all she ever wanted was love and family. 30 or so pages down the road Evelyn says that she would do everything she did again exactly the same and that she doesn't regret a single decision. Which is it Evelyn? Did you learn from your mistakes or did you not? It's a yes or no question, Evelyn!​I don't think she learned anything. It is shown through many, many decisions she kept making throughout the book, but it is definitely solidified with her last decision. When Evelyn encountered something she couldn't cheat, something she couldn't sleep her way out of - she decided that she would just rather die than let the world know that breast cancer beat her. ​First of all, how cowardly is that? Second of all, her daughter died from breast cancer - a true and loving mother would never take her own life, but would battle it and live through what her baby lived through, because no pain is too great for a mother that truly loves her daughter. If anything, a true mother would have thought that the experience, no matter how painful it is, would bring her closer to her daughter still. Third, for all her ""caring"" about Grace - did she even think how Grace would take these news?? Grace was sent on a lovely vacation - imagine her coming back and finding that her employed killed herself? Throught out the book it was made clear that Grace cared for Evelyn, so Evelyn's last act wasn't just cowardly and selfish, she managed to hurt another human being in the process yet again. And how maddening was the scene in the hotel? ""... and you knew that he wasn't going to use a condom...."" Evelyn, you are a grown woman, tell a man to get a f-king condom or he can go and blow himself if he doesn't. She thought herself in control of that night, but that detail shows that she really wasn't at all. Sure, you can argue that her plan wouldn't work if she told him to wear a condom, but hey she's an actress she could have simply told him that they are too hot, too young and too famous to have a baby from the first time having sex (he's a grown man he knows how babies are made) and that would have sobered a rock star like him up real quick. I can honestly talk for pages about how much I hated Evelyn, but there would be no point in that really. I can just as well love the book even if it has a horrible, morally corrupted main character (Lying in wait by Liz Nugent is a great example of that, I loved that sick and twisted book so much!), but other things have to work in the book for me. And so far the characters and the setting did not. So let's move onto the plot. It was just okay, I guess. People keep calling the book revolutionary, but I just don't see it. The plot twists were pretty cliche, and not that well executed in general. Especially the scene with the car crash - oh don't get me started on the scene with the car crash. I'm sorry, are police officers on the scene were actually blind puppies?? Because you can't just pull a body out of the car, take it to the hospital and pretend that the other person (you f-king left there to die) was driving, and that the actual driver just died from a heart attack! The driver had cuts all over his face and his neck was bleeding, his blood was all over the car - Evelyn bought the silence of a cabby driver and some nurses, but what about detectives and police? This scene needed way more research done. Also, what was the point of Monique's side plot line? To show that she could walk away from her husband? To show that she can get the job she wants? What was the point of her mother coming to town? I wanted to like Monique but she was so underdeveloped, it wasn't even funny. She was just there, just another captivated audience member to the show that was all about Evelyn. Sure, there was that big twist at the end, which wasn't as shocking as it surely intended to be. Sure, Monique was the one who would ""understand Evelyn's need to take her own life and not interfere"" because, hey, Monique is apparently also a coward). But as a whole, her character was very and sadly bland. ​While I'm on the subject - we lost so many people to suicide in 2018, you'd think that a book wouldn't try and promote the message of ""dying on your own terms"" or whatever, any further. Suicide affects everybody - not just the one who dies, it leaves a plethora of hurt and pain and emotions to the other people. If anything books should be telling the message of ""keep going"" , ""it will get better"" , ""get help"" , ""sure, it hurts, it's painful, but it's how the life is and it's worth it"". You do realize that the book is probably influencing tons of depressed teens and adults who think ""hey, if Evelyn did it maybe should I?"". I wouldn't wish this kind responsibility on my worst enemy. Sure, Evelyn had no family left, but Evelyn is fictional, and the readers are not,. By the way if you are reading this and you are in a bad place emotionally, just remember that you are not alone, you are loved and I am always willing to offer a listening ear and a comforting word. Moving onto the romance - the only real feeling of love I got was for Harry and Evelyn - that was love, everything else was either lust, possession, obsession or the need to control. I felt lust between Evelyn and Celia, I felt great friendship between them, but their love was so toxic, I am hesitant to call it true love, because that's not what true love is or should be. ​Speaking of true love, it seems that the concept is very lost in this book. When Monique's mom describes her love for Monique's father - in the book it's described as soul mate love, as the purest love of all relationships in the book. And it totally ignores the fact that her husband cheated on her? Kept secrets from his so called soul mate, and led a second life with a man. You don't lie to your soul mate - that isn't true love. The only thing that kept me going with this books is how compulsively readable it was - it was definitely a page turner. But mostly because things kept getting stretched out and Evelyn kept hinting at things to keep readers engaged - which is a cheap writing trick, but hey, it worked really well. I honestly couldn't put it down, no matter how mad it made me. ​Speaking of writing - I enjoyed it - it went really well with the tone of the book, and did a great job at describing shocking parts about the ""glamour of Hollywood"" But, to me it held no emotion. People kept promising tears with this book and I didn't even tear up once. I'd call myself a cold hearted bitch, but I cry at videos of puppies eating carrots, so I know it isn't me this time. The way things were written gave away a lot of the things that were going to happen, so when the sad thing happened, I already knew it would and thus had no emotion to show for it any longer. Also, the conversations felt very stiff at some points. Especially when Evelyn was explaining her sexuality to people - what should have came out as a natural conversation felt like a school lesson with Evelyn just drilling the same point over and over again. I think that took away from believability a bit. ​Obviously, from this long and ranty review you can tell that this book did not work out for me. But that's just me. Lots of people loved it. I am okay with being in minority. I'm not here to change people's opinions, I am here to simply state mine. I am also not here to apologize for my, I guess popular opinions, because these are mine. I felt what I felt and I constructively expressed that. My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG"

75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,Rating 5 out of 5,"I just finished rereading this book and I just loved it so much. I listened to the audiobook, which is great by the way - and I cried so much at the end again. I love this story so much, I love that Evelyn is imperfect and real and she makes mistakes but she’s such an interesting, complex character. And her love story is one of my all time favorites. I actually really enjoyed Moniques chapters in this book this time as well, the first time I wasn’t as interested in them because I wanted to get back to Evelyns story, but this time I really just loved it all. This book is one of my absolute all time favorites. FULL BOOK TALK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujeXq...HUGE THANK YOU to Atria Books for sending me an ARC.I can honestly say I've never read a book like this before. This story is so incredibly unique and original and heart breaking and beautiful. Taylor Jenkins Reid has been one of my favorite authors recently, and this book is even better than I imagined it would be. This is unlike any of her other books, and unlike anything I've even read. I loved reading about the scandal and craziness of being an actress in the 1950's movie scene. I loved reading about Evelyn's romance and heart break and her incredible life story. I started reading it this morning and literally couldn't put it down, hours later I was in tears and finished the story and I feel like I'll never forget these characters and how this story has affected me. This story is so much more than just the life story of a Hollywood actress. It's incredibly moving, and emotional; everything you would expect from a Taylor Jenkins Reid novel and more.I loved everything about this book. Taylor Jenkins Reid is the queen."

Reviews can be found at: www.booknerdtan.wordpress.comNo doubt...5/5 stars.... Read from start to finish and reviewed in one day, if that doesn't say everything I don't know what will. This review will probably just be a load of rambling nonsense as I'm writing it straight after finishing the book and I'm overwhelmed with what I've just read. I loved everything about this wonderful story; the well developed characters, the juicy plot, the interesting way in which it was written and the twist that I never saw coming- all of this from the very start had me totally hooked. To be totally honest, I picked this up because I wanted some light hearted chic lit and whoa did I get way more than I bargained for.I think what hit me the most about this book was how much I felt for every character in it and the relationships that Evelyn built with them. The different types of connections and love you can feel for others really resonated and the characters just felt so real to me. I think maybe after everything Evelyn Hugo did throughout her life, we should feel some kind of animosity towards her, however I cannot help but absolutely adore her and everything she did for herself and others.The entire story from start to finish was so captivating, juicy and dramatic that I managed to finish it in one day as it completely consumed me and I wasn't able to do anything else all day. I loved the way there were articles and reports about Evelyn throughout her career entwined in the story, it really added to the way the story was delivered. I loved the way sexuality was addressed with such raw honesty and transparency and gave some insight into just how far people will go for the people they love.The ending to the book was just beautiful and brought all the tears. This may be my favourite book of 2018 so far. A book I can say is actually worth all the hype that is surrounding it and my heart feels a lot more full right now. What a stunning book."

 4,75 stars
It's safe to say that I loved this book. How can I not love this? It's like watching a beautiful black and white movie where every character is complex, painfully human and most importantly NOT STRAIGHT.After hating so many hyped books lately, I'm happy to say that: 
The hype is deserved!
 It's even deserving of more hype. I loved how beautiful this book was and I'm not talking about the writing. It's the sadness and pain that brings this book to life and even more than that: The Characters.Evelyn Hugo is ready to bare it all in this book. I wanted to take all the secrets she revealed, keep them close to my chest and protect them from this ugly reality. She's complex. She's cruel. She's passionate. She's human. And if you don't understand all of her. You don't desreve to love her. And God Did I fall head over heels for her! She's hands down:  The best female character I've ever read about.On her way to fame, she lost so much of herself. Hurt so many people. And she's completly unapologetic. Married seven guys yet loved only one person. Someone she wasn't allowed to have. But who she loved anyway. If love is the only word to express what they felt for each other than that's what we will call it, even if it was so much more.Harry, her best friend is my spirit animal. Celia, with all of her passion is someone I would've loved to get to know.I loved every character except for: Monique. The journalist. If she's a journalist I should be an author by now. How can someone be so stupid, is beyond me.This book will break you in all the right ways. But you will be happy that you've read something so beautiful. I definitely recommend this to everyone.
Thank you for reading this review! and I hope you have an amazing life.

81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30978160-meredith-trying-to-catch-up,Rating 3 out of 5," “The world respects people who think they should be running it.”  3.5 stars The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo  is a drama about a famous movie star and her seven marriages.The narrative alternates between Monique, an upcoming journalist, and Evelyn Hugo. I was lulled into Evelyn’s chapters by her voice, and of course, I wanted all the details of her marriages. She was brutally honest and not afraid to paint herself in a less-than-pleasant light. Monique’s chapters were bland and hard to connect with. Evelyn isn’t wholly likable. Her actions are sometimes hard to read, but I appreciated her story and the frankness she took when sharing it. I enjoyed watching her craft her moves, on and off the screen. Some of her relationships were a blip, while others were the starring roles. There is one marriage behind it all that was surprising.This novel focuses on love--not only romantic love, but also love between friends and the love between parents and their children. I went into this with extremely high expectations. Having recently read Carrie Soto is Back,  the bar was high. Unfortunately, while this was entertaining, it was a bit of a miss. While Evelyn is a dynamic and commanding character who led a fascinating life, I was let down by how much telling there was behind her story. I wanted more showing.  This quote sums up my reading experience: “Evelyn always leaves you hoping you’ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.” This novel only grazes the surface of love, loss, and acceptance, but the final chapter ends on a high note, and the last sentence made me smile. "

I never thought I would like it this much after continuously fighting the urge to DNF it for months but this one was exceptionally and truly and devastatingly beautiful. It took me months to finish it because I was inattentive to the first few chapters because reading Monique's POV felt like I was reading a journal. I was always so fascinated with Evelyn the moment she appeared. There's something about Evelyn Hugo that won't let you stop thinking about who she was? She will left you hoping you get just a little bit more about her and then denies you that very thing. 
People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is“You’re safe with me”—that’s intimacy.
The story is beautiful but also very heartbreaking. The hardships Celia, Evelyn,Harry and John went through because they wanted to fell in love with people the world would never allow them to. They were real and Taylor showed us the ugly truth and the ugly bargains of the society and the acting industry all the while giving us this story which is not just a love story about two women falling in love. 
”Evelyn, who was your great love? You can tell me.”Evelyn looks out the window, breathes in deeply, and then says, “Celia St. James.”
I loved it—the romance between Celia and Evelyn, Harry and Evelyn's friendship, the found family trope, Eveyln and her struggles, her need to marry seven husbands, the heartbreaks and the love. The bi rep and loved the way it was emphasised throughout the whole book with Evelyn's journey for accepting her sexuality and owing it. The writing was simply so beautiful and exquisite. I've always loved reading TJR book because there's just something about her storytelling that just makes you feel everything the characters feels. I felt Evelyn's pain, love, fears and her loss. 
 ""Make sure the reader understands that all I was ever really looking for was family. Make sure it's clear that I found it. Make sure they know that I am heartbroken without it.""
Everything was perfect except the plot twist about why Evelyn chooses Monique to write her biography  and Celia's toxic behaviour. I expected a ""plot twisting plot twist"" and it kinda left me underwhelmed in the end. It was anticlimactic though I didn't knew the reason Why she chose her till the very last moment it was disclosed. ➺ Evelyn HugoThis woman loved selflessly, lived fearlessly and lost so much. She is one of the most impactful, compassionate and strong character I've ever read. She accepted her sexuality and never let that make feel any little. She is stunningly beautiful, charismatic and everything about her screams Legend and an ICON. She used her body, used her talent and sold her value to the the those who were eager to use her but little did they know Evelyn is the one using them and she did everything she could to earn the top place in Hollywood. Even if it wasn't for her beautiful and sexy body Evelyn was always meant to be the Evelyn Hugo of the Hollywood because she knew how to get what she wants. But after chasing the fame and money all she wanted was someone to see just the real Evelyn not the star Evelyn Hugo but she only had two people who saw the real her or atleast the one she was trying to be— Harry and Celia. People thought everything about her was black and white but Evelyn was full of colours and they always refused to see that beauty until Celia and Harry came. She never regretted a single thing or any deal or bargain she made in her life because she knew she had to for the people she loved endlessly and truly. I love her so much and there are no words to describe her and how much she means to me. She deserved the world and every ounce of happiness this world has to offer.
""Did I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.""""And I didn’t say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don’t feel regret for the things I’ve done – at least, not the things you might expect – despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.""
➺ Harry CameronThe sweetest, kindhearted, purest soul and the most amazing person. I loved him and the way he was always ready to help Evelyn no matter what. His unconditional love for Evelyn and his daughter. He is the best friend one could ever have. I was so happy for him when he found the love of his life until that tragedy happened 😭 He deserved so much better and the best in this book. His relationship with his daughter was so wholesome and precious. He and John deserved the life filled with all the love and happiness. ➺ Celia St. JamesCelia with Evelyn and Celia are too different persons. Just Celia was kind and likable but Celia with Evelyn was a bit toxic for Evelyn. She was beautiful and kind and everything Evelyn fell in love with. I liked her when she was with Evelyn and loved Evelyn the way she deserved to be loved. I liked her when she first appeared but I didn't like when she tried to hurt Evelyn and called her names because she was hurt. It was toxic no matter how much she loved Evelyn. Maybe I would've loved her more and felt connected to het if there were any Celia's pov. ➺ Monique GrantI don't know what to say about her because her character was so boring and I wasn't even interested in her life or story.
➙ Evelyn and Celia's realtionship
Their love was everything. It was the kind of love that never dies no matter how many years they spend apart. They never had enough time but they always tried to make the most of it. The way they loved each other was so pure and raw. Evelyn's life was divided between before Celia and after Celia. The way she loved and cared for her is beyond this world. 
""I broke Celia’s heart because I spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much I loved her.""""I’d give it all up, you know. All of it. The money and the jobs and the fame. I’d give it all up just to be with you, just to be normal with you.""
Evelyn did everything she could to protect their identity and her love for Celia but that just made her lose her even more. I know the choices Evelyn put through Celia and I know why Celia left her when she had enough of the lies and pain. I was always heartbroken when they weren't together. They both deserved so much better and all the happiness and the love and I was happy for them when they finally found it in the end even though they had very little time to spent together but it was theirs.
“Evelyn, I have been in love with you since 1959. I may not have always shown it, I may have let other things get in the way, but know that I have loved you that long. That I have never stopped. And that I never will.”I closed my eyes briefly, letting her words sink in. And then I gave her mine.“I have been married seven times, and never once has it felt half as right as this. I think that loving you has been the truest thing about me.”

➙ Harry and Evelyn's friendship
The absolute best and the most precious friendship in the entire universe. It was E V E R Y T H I N G. Its so rare to have a friendship like this and I was so happy that Harry and Evelyn found each other. 
You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”So I fell down.And Harry caught me.
Harry empowered her and loved her, and was always ready to catch her when she fell. They were soulmates, family and friends. Everything was about them was so beautiful and comforting. The way they created there own family together and found happiness together, helped each other everytime and were always together. It was so perfect. 
“It’s me and you.”“Me and you, true blue.”It was around that time that I started to believe that friendships could be written in the stars. “If there are all different types of soul mates,” I told Harry one afternoon, when the two of us were sitting out on the patio with Connor, “then you are one of mine.”
The ending was not what I thought would be but Evelyn's choice somehow makes sense and I knew she would never let the very thing destroyed her that made her Star Evelyn Hugo. It was heartbreaking but it was also right for her. I completed this book at 2 am and couldn't sleep and was just staring at the ceiling and crying for all the good and bad things Evelyn went through and the way she lived her life on her own terms however painful it was for her. Like Evelyn I wouldn't try to change a single thing about her story. It was hers and it was imperfectly perfect. I don't what you all are doing in life if you still haven't read this book.

84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22727329-victoria,Rating 3 out of 5,"I shouldn’t have liked this due to the clichéd writing, hackneyed plot and transparent characters. And yet, I enjoyed it because I’m a sucker for Old Hollywood, I like a ballsy female protagonist--one who knows what she wants and goes after it--and I like realistic endings. Wrapped up with pretty bows endings don’t reflect real life and they often irritate me.I found this an easy read after a few emotional books and, since I don’t read gossipy magazines, I felt as if I was taking a walk on the trashy side and I liked it. Three stars for sheer entertainment. Feel free to judge, like the titular protagonist says, “I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.”"
85,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104791668-terrie-robinson,Rating 5 out of 5,"""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"" by Taylor Jenkins Reid is so much more than I expected!Can it really be true that Monique Grant, an unknown journalist has been asked by Evelyn Hugo to write her biography? It's an offer Monique doesn't expect and simply can't refuse. It's an offer that will make her famous, rich beyond her dreams!Monique's most poignant question to Evelyn: ""Who was the great love of your life?"". The answer is a bit complicated and Monique will have to wait for the answer. Evelyn has years of delicious stories to tell first! Evelyn begins by telling Monique about her Cuban heritage and poor beginnings in New York City. How she used looking older than she was to her advantage. How becoming a 'blonde', using her breathtaking beauty and shapely figure helped her realize the dream of becoming an actress. Within the glamour of 1950's Hollywood, Evelyn tells of her ambition to become a 'movie star'. She describes the bad movies before the good ones came along, but they did come. She talks about her lasting friendships, her closely held secrets, the details of her seven marriages to her seven husbands, nothing is held back. NOTHING!But, why did Evelyn ask Monique to write her story? Is there a connection between them? Why choose a magazine reporter instead of an author? BTW, why did Evelyn suddenly give up her career in the 1980's?Seven husbands in Hollywood? Doesn't seem far-fetched, right? But, there is so much more to this story than that. There's another layer. A layer I didn't expect, didn't see coming, one that took me totally by surprise!I loved the 'Old Hollywood' flavor in this book created by the author. The scandals, the female versus male mid-century standards that is so full of drama. I just love watching those old movies! Don't you? But what I really loved about this book was that last unexpected twist at the end! Bravo! 4.5 stars rounded up!"

I loved every single thing about Taylor Jenkins Reid's The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. I had been meaning to read it since it was published last year, but something else always popped up in front of it, until I decided I needed to see what everyone was raving about. And boy, did I ever!!Evelyn Hugo is a film legend. She is an Academy Award-winning actress, a philanthropist, a fashion icon, and, at her heyday, was one of the most stunningly beautiful women in the world. She retired from film in the late 1980s and mostly stayed out of the spotlight, enduring her share of tragedies. But her mystique still lingers.When she decides to auction off some of her most iconic gowns to raise funds for charity, Evelyn also decides it's time to give an interview. She chooses to tell her story to Vivant magazine, but demands that a reasonably unknown reporter, Monique Grant, be the one to interview her. No one, Monique included, understands why Evelyn has chosen her, but the actress is utterly unwavering in her demand.When Monique meets Evelyn, she is dazzled by her beauty, but is moved by her strength and her kindness. Evelyn isn't actually interested in giving an interview to Vivant—she wants Monique to write her biography, publishable after her death, and wants Monique to make a fortune once it's time to make a publishing deal. Although she can't figure out why Evelyn would give this prize to her, and she knows it could endanger her job, Monique jumps at the chance to hear the legend's life story in her own words.""When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.""In Evelyn's luxurious Manhattan penthouse apartment, she begins unfurling her rise to fame, from growing up in Hell's Kitchen in the 1950s to making her way to Hollywood, from getting her start in movies to her decision to leave acting 30+ years later. Of course, she lays bare the stories behind her seven marriages and the men she took into her life, and the scandals, happy moments, and pain that accompanied those relationships. Evelyn gives Monique the unvarnished truth and doesn't want to be portrayed as a good person—she knows she was ruthlessly ambitious, hurtful, calculating, and unwavering in getting what she wanted. But at one point, she was the highest paid actress in Hollywood, and her intelligence and ambition helped get her there.As Monique listens to Evelyn's story, and is moved by the complexities of her emotions, she has her own emotional challenges to figure out as well. And as Evelyn's journey helps shape her own decisions, she still wonders why the actress chose her. But Evelyn also helps change Monique's frame of reference in certain ways, how she thinks of situations and people.""It's always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is compulsively readable, like one of those television miniseries you can't stop watching. I'm a huge movie fan and love reading stories of ""old Hollywood,"" and Reid captures that mood and environment so perfectly. But this is more than a soapy melodrama—this is a book with surprising depth, thought-provoking in the subjects it touches on, and unapologetic in its portrayal of what women needed to do to succeed in Hollywood.Reid is an amazing storyteller. I know many have spoken highly of her earlier books and I'm going to have to check those out. But this book was fantastic from start to finish. I devoured the whole book in just a few hours because I couldn't get enough of it, but of course, I'm sad now that it's over. This was a terrific story of love, loss, self-reliance, and the struggle of being true to yourself and having to adhere to the roles society puts you in.Pick this one up!See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html."
87,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,Rating 5 out of 5,"Oh, this addictive novel made my queer boy heart sing. In The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, we follow Monique Grant, a writer struggling to launch her career. As part of her job at the magazine she works at, she gets called on to do a cover story about Evelyn Hugo, a famous actress who had seven husbands. Evelyn has a surprise for Monique: instead of giving her enough material for one article, she wants to give her her whole life story, so that Monique can write her biography. This opportunity serves as a huge boon for Monique, the chance to write a biography that will make her millions of dollars. But, as Monique peels back the layers of Evelyn's life - her ambitious climb to the top as a Cuban woman, the seven husbands she married and left, and a grand, gay secret - she learns that her story intersects with Evelyn's in a shocking way.Taylor Jenkins Reid's writing drew me into this story and did not let me go. Her prose contains an assertive, effortless, and clear quality that made pages fly by. The style of this novel reminded me a lot of 
Big Little Lies
, in that both of their premises may seem lighthearted and a little inconsequential, but their actual contents are deep and meaningful. Similar to Big Little Lies, this book's plot moves at an energetic, clever pace that had me dying to know what would happen next. The gossip columns interspersed throughout the book added an appropriate glitz and glamour, while conveying how much Hollywood misses when reporting on the lives of its stars.The feminist themes throughout The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo had me cheering and whisper-screaming ""yes queen!"" throughout the whole book. Reid includes so many important ideas in this novel: the sexism women have to overcome to advance in society, the objectification of women's bodies and how women are taught to use their bodies as currency, and the unfair double standards in which women get shamed for their sexuality and their divorces and men walk away scot-free. Reid creates an iconic character with Evelyn Hugo, who feels larger than life in how she narrates her story to Monique . Monique, too, develops throughout the book into a women more confident in her desires and how to pursue them. Just a few feminist lines that stood out to me:""Harry was one of the only men on the lot who didn't stare directly at my chest. It actually bothered me, as if I'd been doing something wrong to not get his attention. It just goes to show that if you tell a woman her only skill is to be desirable, she will believe you.""""'That, in and of itself, is awfully cynical, don't you think? Divorce is loss.'Evelyn shakes her head. 'Heartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.'... When Evelyn says this, I stop my pen in place. I look up at her. And I wonder why I needed Evelyn to tell me that. I wonder why that sort of distinction has never crossed my mind before.""""I was gorgeous, even at fourteen. Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn’t know her power, but I’m sick of all that. I turned heads.""The book's incorporation of queer sexuality and homophobia also had me walking side to side. Evelyn's relationships with Celia had me fanboying so hard from the very start. I felt so much vicarious joy and angst from their relationship. Reid writes their dialogue in such an electric, snappy, and enticing way. Similar to another one of my favorite 2018 reads, 
The Heart's Invisible Furies
, Reid shows how homophobia literally damaged and destroyed queer people's relationships and forced them into hiding. Just like John Boyne, Reid compels us to care about one of the main characters of this book, Evelyn Hugo, so our hearts break alongside hers when things get rough with Celia. Reid also addresses bisexuality and biphobia with sensitivity in this book, so hats off to her.Overall, an excellent read I would recommend to fans of fiction, especially fast-paced fiction with strong, complex women and queer characters as well. This novel took me by surprise and I hope it can touch other people's hearts as much as it touched mine. Now I have to check out Reid's other books because this one just blew me away."
88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30510075-andie,Rating 3 out of 5,"I've been putting this review off for a few weeks now and I'm still uncertain about how to approach it. Because unlike most people, I did not love this book. Nor did I hate it either, though. My feelings lay somewhere in between and that's a hard place to sit. What's most surprising to me is that there is a TJR book that I'm not head over heels in love with! The story started off intriguing enough...Monique Grant, writer who hasn't quite made a name for herself yet, gains the opportunity of a lifetime when Hollywood icon Evelyn Hugo chooses her to write her biography. Monique having no ties to Evelyn is understandably baffled, why her? Nevertheless, she agrees to do the piece and begins meeting Evelyn each day to hear her story and hopefully learn the reasoning behind Evelyn's choice of author.THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO reads as a narrative of Evelyn's life. At first, I was completely sucked into the glam and glitz of a Hollywood starlet. And like Monique, I couldn't help but wonder why her? I formed my own speculations and let me tell you, each one of them was wrong. All seven husbands held a purpose and in their own way helped Evelyn become the sensation that the world knows her as. There is so much drama, gossip, secrets, and intrigue that it's easy to get swept away and lost inside of it all. Buuuutt...somewhere along the way I stopped caring and dare I say, I was bored? I'm not entirely sure what happened. Maybe there was TOO much drama for me. Maybe it was the fact that there wasn't one single likeable character, aside from Harry, but in the end even he held a secret that I was not 100% okay with. Or possibly this was just bad timing for me. I think this quote just about sums up how I feel about Evelyn ""I hate Evelyn, but I think I like her very much. I wish she had never existed, and yet I can't help but admire her a great deal."" Because you see, Evelyn is NOT a good person. She does questionable things and never once considers or cares if she hurts anyone else. And yet you do understand her reasoning behind everything. You see, very complicated feelings! Either way, TJR's writing is amazing and I love that she took risks and wrote something completely out of her usual zone. This may not be headed to my favorites shelf but I do know that many, many other people will enjoy this book and I recommend it to anyone wanting to read something new and unique.*Thank you to Atria Books and Netgalley for providing me a copy in exchange for an honest review.*"
89,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is an gem of a read from Taylor Jenkins Reid and fully deserving of all the plaudits it is receiving. Evelyn Hugo is a woman consumed by ruthless ambition that allowed her to transcend her background from Hell's Kitchen with immigrant Cuban parents and sweep her way into Hollywood, forging a career that saw her rise to unprecedented heights in tinsel town as a unrivalled film star. Becoming a recluse, and now 79 years old, the indomitable, larger than life, Evelyn finally has nothing standing in her way and is now preparing to tell all about her glamorous and scandalous life. For no apparent reason, she has chosen the little known reporter, Monique Grant, on Vivant magazine to interview her. With her life in troubled disarray, Monique intends to grasp this opportunity to further her ambitions, with little awareness of the impact this interview will have on her.We learn of the Hollywood of this era, of Evelyn's seven husbands, the position of women at this time and forbidden love. It is a story of friendship, secrets, lies, abuse, betrayal and sacrifice as the flawed Evelyn pours forth an unapologetic and truthful account of her tumultuous life as a connection develops between her and Monique. Reid does beautiful and mesmerising storytelling with complex, nuanced and multilayered characterisation. This is a must read, an emotionally heart wrenching novel that will not fail to grip the reader. It portrays in detail what it took for a woman to succeed in the Hollywood of this era. Just brilliant! Many thanks to Simon and Schuster for an ARC."

The ending was brilliant.The thing is, I nearly missed it completely because I was ready to throw the book down around a third of the way through. I'd enjoyed the opening chapters well enough, but as Evelyn's story began to unfold, I quickly grew frustrated by the shallowness and awfulness of every character except the young journalist, Monique. It turned out that the cast's prima-donna behaviour was crucial to the story and was paving the way for a really punchy ending. But, by god, that middle section was a slog, so it's only three stars from me.Sorry."

I had tried to get into this one a couple of times prior, but I just couldn't connect with the audio version and the timing wasn't right in the past. After a tumultuous trial period, I found that sometimes the timing needs to be just right to enjoy a book to the fullest, and I'm glad I was finally able to experience Evelyn in her full glory. "

She will still be an icon, a fictional Hollywood legend that will stay in my mind forever. I fell in love with this book and those characters all over again. Also, there’s no enough words to do Harry justice. He’s just too precious. I still believe that this book is a biography in its own way.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~5 starsEvelyn Hugo might be the most real fictional character I’ve ever read about.Now talk about a book that is worth the hype! I’ve been delaying reading this book for so long and I still don’t know why. I guess I was kinda intimidated by Evelyn Hugo and after reading this book I guess I was right to be.”And it will be the tragedy of my life that I cannot love you enough to make you mine. That you cannot be loved enough to be anyone’s.”Evelyn is such a complex intimidating character. She’s such a flawed unlikable person, but for some reason, I couldn’t help but admire her. She was such a powerful unique woman. Was she a good likable person? No. Did I understand and admired her any way? Surprisingly, yes. You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until somewhat stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”This book is a biography of many women and men. It’s a biography of many Hollywood stars. It’s a biography of the people who lived during that time. It covered everything. This might be fiction, but it was a such a realistic reflection of real life. The good, the bad, and the ugly. People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is “You’re safe with me”—that’s intimacy.I loved the writing and the way this book was written. It was flawless. I Loved the story, it touched me in a way I never expected. I loved how I kept reminding myself that Evelyn Hugo is a fictional character because I couldn’t believe that she is. I loved that book, and I’m not sure I’ll be able to stop thinking about. This is such a remarkable book that’s going to be considered a classic one day.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.Song recommendation:Young and beautiful by Lana Del ReyHope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have by Lana Del ReyWish you were here by Pink Floyd505 by Arctic MonkeysBravado by LordeOld money by Lana Del ReyThe show must go on by Queen"

Broke my heart all over again and left me feeling devastated that Evelyn Hugo isn’t a real life person. Didn’t expect to cry as much again, since I knew what was coming, but no I still sobbed again. Cannot recommend this book enough!First read 31 August 2018 Review:LOVE WHEN NOBODY WARNS ME THAT THIS BOOK WILL BREAK MY HEART 😩💔 CW: Homophobia/Biphobia, domestic abuse, death, suicide, cancer If that doesn’t let you know how I feel about this book then I don’t know what will. I cried multiple times and I wasn’t ready! This book was so interesting to me and Evelyn’s character is just so fascinating! I kept reading because I just wanted to know more about her life! This just shows how good the writing was in my opinion. This book also reminded me HUGELY of “The Devil Wears Prada”, as I found Evelyn to be so similar to Miranda (Meryl Streep’s character) and Monique to be similar to Andrea (Anne Hathaway’s character). Overall I absolutely loved this book and I’m so glad I read it! Definitely gonna be one of my favorite reads by the end of the year!"

No solo por su protagonista sino también por todo lo que me ha hecho sentir. Creo que la autora ha sabido reflejar muy bien a la actriz de los años 50 de Hollywood, una mujer que salió de la nada para conseguirlo todo. La autora nos presenta una novela sobre una actriz de cine, los riesgos que asumió, todos los amores que tuvo y perdió y su secreto mayor guardado. No esperaba tanto cuando empecé a leer esta novela, me ha fascinado el personaje de Evelyn Hugo creo que es una gran protagonista una mujer con mucha fuerza, y capaz de hacer lo que pocos estamos dispuestos. Además hay un misterio que resolver en cuanto a la protagonista y su relación con Monique. No me olvido de Harry i Celia, unos personajes inolvidables. Sin duda es una novela que nos hace reflexionar sobre el mundo en los años 50, todo lo que sucede a la protagonista, lo que debe hacer para llegar a la fama. Pero también es una novela sobre el amor y la amistad. Trata temas como la violència de genero y la persecución al colectivo LGBT."

The 7 marriages!Evelyn, now in her late 70’s, has decided she is willing to do her biography and have it sold only after she’s dead. So, the secrets pour out to a low on the totem pole writer, Monique. TJR is great at lighter reads that have depth. Themes of homosexuality, domestic abuse, infidelity, loss of identity, heartbreak and heartache. The price is sacrifice for stardom. And the ending?

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestThis is the second over-hyped book I've picked up this month that actually pleasantly surprised me (the first one was Holly Black's THE CRUEL PRINCE, if you're curious). I'd actually been avoiding THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO, because it sounded like more of that gently-padded historical fiction I can't stand, where the past ties into the present of some plucky, Pinterest-and-yoga type, who has her uncertain future resolved by some personal revelation of the past (I am looking at you, SECRET HISTORY OF THE PINK CARNATION). It was only when I saw reviews suggesting that the subject matter contained herein might be darker, and weightier, than I thought, that I decided to bite the bullet and dive in.My goodness, but this book was not only amazing - it turned out to be just the thing I needed right now. Readable. Suspenseful. A little light, yes, but in no way padded or fluffy. Beneath that attractive cover is a core of jabby metal spikes, and you can say the same of the titular heroine, Evelyn Hugo, who's a cross between Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe (with a dash of Merle Oberon), with all the cunning of a Machiavellian prince. This is a woman who knows exactly what she wants, and will do anything to get it - and succeeds. The narrator is a multiracial woman named Monique, who works for a Vogue-like magazine called Vivant. Monique is just a mid-level reporter, very low on the food-chain, and she's feeling depressed because her husband tried to force her to choose between him and her career - and she's having second guesses about the choice she made and the effects that it will have on her life. Nobody is more surprised than Monique when her editor grumpily tells her that she, and she alone, has been offered the rare opportunity for an exclusive interview with the now-reclusive actress. Even more shocking still - when Monique and Evelyn finally meet, Evelyn tells her that the interview was just a ruse: Evelyn doesn't want an op-ed piece, she wants a retrospective, written in the form of a book, and she wants Monique to publish it, and tell her story in the way that she, Evelyn, intends.There are several ""parts"" to this novel, each divided by husbands. Evelyn's seven husbands each represent a significant milestone in her life, and it was really incredible how the author managed to make them all different, and yet all realistically flawed. Evelyn also talks about the mysterious ""great love of her life"" and the way that her sexuality defined her so much in her youth, and how chasing fame ended up leaving her feeling desolate and lonely at the end of her life. In some ways, TSHOEH reminded me of Jacqueline Susann's VALLEY OF THE DOLLS in how it provides a grim portrait of the way Hollywood chews up young starlets and spits them out, and the very short shelf-life of the attractiveness of women, and how this superficiality rules the people who chase it and abide by it. I was also reminded of this gorgeous Japanese film I love, Millennium Actress (2001), which is about this ordinary but beautiful girl in Japan who becomes a famous and iconic star, and as she makes film after successful film, the scenes from her movies end up serving as mirrors that reflect her pursuit of the one that she imagines that she loves. The actress in Millennium Actress also ends up as a recluse, who ends up telling her story to a low-ranked supporter in an exclusive retrospective about her life.I think what makes TSHOEH really stand out, though, is the seriousness of the content. Sexism in the film industry, and institutionalized sexism, sure. But then there's also the topics of assisted suicide, domestic violence (and the trap of normalizing this abuse while living in this situation), racism, internalized racism, and sexuality. The Stonewall riots are mentioned, and the erasure of bisexuality actually plays a pretty huge role in the story. This is one of the few books I've read that really goes into what it's like being bi, and portrays relationships with people of both genders. I also really liked how Monique was half-black and Evelyn was Cuban-American, and how their cultures shaped them.THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO is a really good book. The pacing is really well done, and like Monique, I found that this Interview with the Vampire-style format kept me coming back for more, because with every question answered, another immediately popped up in its place. Reading this is like reading one of those mildly trashy grand epics of the 70s and 80s that follow one character throughout their life, chronicling their loves, their hubris, and their sorrows. It was a fun, solid read with good characters, and a darned good (if bittersweet) story. You should read it!4.5 stars"
100,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48245126-anna-pascucci,Rating 1 out of 5,"****Spoilers*********Spoilers*****1 star. I knew I was in for it from the very very beginning when I read the dedication page of this book: It reads as follows:""Smash the patriarchy, sweetheart.""...Oh good god *eye roll* Give me a break... I would like to call this book review: The Seven Rants of Evelyn Hugo (and friends)They go as follows:1. Evelyn is the most immoral character I have ever read about in my life. What kind of message is the author sending to young women with the character of Evelyn Hugo? Fuck, lie, cheat, scheme your way into getting anything you want regardless of who it hurts or the damage your actions can cause. Only focus on yourself, your own desires, your own pleasures and to hell with the rest of it. Where is the self-respect in spreading your legs to reach fame and fortune? Where is the dignity in bending over so you can manipulate people? Oh yeah, just as long as it is in the name of WOMAN POWER! Silly, me.  2. Monique annoyed the hell out of me.The attempt made by the author for Monique's personal life and some of Evelyn's personal life to run in parallels was basically spoon fed to the reader. She felt like a super undeveloped character, with barely any social skills from the way she talked to Evelyn, (I mean I had second-hand embarrassment with this character) and none of Monique's issues besides the death of her dad were all that shocking or relatable. Dang, Monique, you just had one of the richest women in the world ask you to write her life's story knowing you will make millions and millions off of it and your over here acting like you were just asked to eat three bags of sand. 3. ""Smells like clay""I literally laughed out loud at the sheer stupidity of the way Evelyn described Celia coming out of the shower. This is not verbatim... ""She didn't smell like shampoo, she smelled like clay."" Clay?? Clay??? .... uhhhhh.....come again. 4. The Abortion Look, I am going to be frank in saying I think abortion is wrong on so many levels and for a multitude of reasons. But the way the book just handled abortion and how grossly irresponsible Evelyn was in her sexual relations is something that I find truly deplorable. Where is humanity going? Evelyn literally says she crosses her fingers, as she is screwing this guy, and hopes for the best...aka I hope I don't get pregnant...oh but don't worry if I do I can just do a little baby murdering... no big deal. This is bad folks... bad... not what we should be idolizing or raving about. This is not a progressive and strong this female character this is a whore with no morals or values. I find it repulsive. 5. Suicide I cannot believe this book went to this place... I guess I should not have been too surprised but the truth is I was. Evelyn's suicide was so poorly handled. The author just pretty much gave the green light for people who are suicidal to end their life if that's what they truly want. If Evelyn is powerful and can get what she wants no matter who or what's in her way, well why can't I? And if death is what I want well let me take that too... just like Evelyn did. This was in such bad taste and I do not understand how people are not totally upset with the suicide at the end? I mean, the author wrote her suicide to be poetic and romantic.. ""she just wants to go home"" ""she has no one left she loves here."" ""my chest made me, my chest won't end me."" ..where is the rage people?!6. Grace's vacation.Oh Gracie, dear, I love you so much, you work so hard and you are deserving of a beautiful, relaxing vacation with your husband. Bye bye, have fun, run along. 8 hours later... Gracie dears vacation (and emotional well being) is ruined because Evelyn commits suicide... 7. The Hook of the BookWhen the author has to tell you the hook of this book is who was Evelyn Hugo's greatest love and then not even halfway through the book she just straight up tells you and then you get to follow the pathetic drama between her and the lover... while the big reveal is the woman who is writing your life story is the daughter of your best friend's/ex-husband's second gay lover...??? ugh, what!!!!Puke on that.How is this book getting 5 stars? How are people thinking this immoral, grotesque, crap is revolutionary. God help us. "
101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73003854-paige-ptsungirl,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.""Wow.I loved this.I loved it.I loved that I came out of this feeling so neutral about a situation that was impossible to reconcile. That's absolute writing genius. As a first Taylor Jenkins Reid read (how funny!), I was not disappointed in the slightest. Some books are jut magic, and this is one of them.There were so many things to love. Evelyn's friendship with Harry, her drive to never give up on her dream, her love for her family, her daughter. She takes care of herself because no one else really ever did. And she never let a single person make her feel ordinary, which is why I chose that quote for my stand out.I love that she is pushing Monique to take her chance to make a difference, to right her wrong (in a way?). I love that the theme subtly goes from the love shared between friends and lovers, to the love of family and work depending on where you want to take your life. That it's okay to take either path and be successful. I love that Evelyn doesn't want Monique to feel less loved by her parents for a single second more. I love that the idea that the truth stands in the middle is the reason I can't dislike Evelyn. That instead, I love her complexity.I loved, so much, that Evelyn never let anyone tell her who she was. That she stood up for being bisexual and proudly stated it. That even when it caused continuous problems with Celia, she never let anyone else define her.I wish it hadn't taken me so long to read this, but sometimes you read a book and sometimes a book reads you... this is one that read me."

103,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35538316-lindy,Rating 1 out of 5,"I'm annoyed because I expected to like this book!I think part of the problem may come down to expectations: I had been led to believe that The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was a work of serious fiction taking a look at celebrity, aging, relationships, sexuality, the race politics of Old Hollywood and so on, but while maybe it could've been in the hands of a different author, Taylor Jenkins Reid lacks both a historical imagination and the skill to imbue emotional gravitas. As a result, the book is heavy handed and cheesy. Reid chooses to spend three paragraphs explaining a character's actions, when the intent or meaning of those actions are already perfectly clear to the reader. Every time a character opens their mouth to discuss LGBT issues, I cringed because it sounds more like a sixth grader's report for history class than anything someone would have said as they were in the midst of living it. There are scattered nuggets of ""wisdom"" that I can't take any more seriously than a ""live laugh love"" wall decal because they sound just like wall decals. The writing generally annoyed me on a sentence to sentence level; at one point a handsome, young, healthy athlete is described as looking ""as all-American as a husk of corn."" Not an ear of corn, mind you, the husk; that is, the dry papery part, mostly seen in metaphors to describe an elderly person's skin. And the book's just not that deep! I don't understand why it seems like everyone thinks it is!Fifteen years and an inevitable miniseries later, Evelyn Hugo will probably come to be regarded the way we currently regard Valley of the Dolls: seriously discussed upon its release but remembered strictly for camp value. If you want to read historical fiction about celebrity, aging, relationships, sexuality, the race politics of Old Hollywood, etc., read The Air You Breathe. If you want to read a book about a profoundly unlikable actress/Hollywood producer's ex-wife in the 1960s, read Play It as It Lays."

106,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,Rating 5 out of 5,"Well, I’m certainly late to the party, but glad I showed up! The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is well-worth all of the hype it’s received over the past couple of years. It was a dramatic and engaging book, and I loved it. The story focuses on an older Evelyn telling the story of her life to 35 year old writer, Monique, who works at a magazine in NYC. Monique wants more for herself and is intrigued as to why Evelyn sought her out, specifically, for this opportunity. Most of the book is told through Evelyn’s first person POV of the past, with small snippets of Monique’s present day POV interspersed throughout. It was an interesting story that hooked me right away. Seven husbands is undoubtedly excessive but I had to see who they were, why Evelyn married them, and why they didn’t work out. I was also dying to know why Evelyn chose Monique for this memoir opportunity. Evelyn was a NY-born actress who wanted “more” and wanted a better life; she was dying to escape Hell’s Kitchen and did whatever she needed to in order to make it to Hollywood. She adjusted her image to fit in yet always stood out. Self-confidence was a non-issue for her. Along the way, Evelyn meets many men and her relationships with them often shaped the course of her life, both personal and professional. I didn’t particularly find her character to be likable, yet I was so engrossed in the story, I didn’t care, and had to see what would happen next. That said, I easily felt like Evelyn could be a real person and this could have been a true story, not just fictional. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a story about life, love, loss, and the sacrifices we sometimes make for those we love. Taylor Jenkins Reid is quite the writer and I will definitely be reading more from her soon."
107,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91713414-dd,Rating 5 out of 5,"life, love, fame, and everything in between l 100% I would just like to start off by saying that this book is a masterpiece. it is so well done, so well-written, so thought out.... i don’t even know if i am going to be able to write a review. Because there are no words. I cannot possibly begin to describe in words what this book was; how it made me feel. Before i started it, I wanted to have read it without actually having to read it. I knew it would be good, (after all, it’s insanely hyped,) but I had a feeling i wouldn’t enjoy reading it very much. I thought I would get bored; I thought it might be too dense and confusing for me. How wrong I was. I loved this book every step of the way. Society has so desperately needed a book like this one, and it makes me so very happy that this book exists. Thank you, TJR. THE PLOT/STORYthis book switches between the present and the past. In the present, Evelyn Hugo tells a journalist her life story. In the past, we see her life story for ourselves. The plot of this book is a woman’s life. But it’s also so much more than that. It teaches us about fame, about love, about friendship, about sorrow, about happiness, and above all, about humans. Let me just tell you, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo gets everything right. Everything. It depicts life and love in a way that I have never seen before; it is captivating and stunning. I was never bored during this book, not once. I was enthralled from the very first pages. I feel like every famous person should have a book like this written about them. I would understand them so much more, and I feel like it would help people see that they are humans, too, just like us ordinaries. Even though I have next to nothing in common with Evelyn Hugo, this book still makes me feel understood and seen. that’s how spectacular it is. THE CHARACTERSEvelyn: I am not lying when I say that Evelyn Hugo is one of the most interesting characters I have ever had the pleasure to read about. She has so many layers, so much depth to her, it is truly amazing how the author wrote such a character. I found it so interesting how the person who the media saw and the person who Evelyn actually is are very different. She is ambitious, loving, kind, cruel, talented, and beautiful. Evelyn Hugo is many things, but most of all, she is human.I am honored beyond words to have been given the chance to know her and her story. Harry: to put it simply, I would die for Harry Cameron. not to be dramatic or anything, but I would actually die for him. He was probably my #1 favorite character in the entire book. He was so pure, so sweet, so kind, and yet he too had layers and depth. He too was human, he too battled his own inner demons. He too was very different from who he was and who the media expected him to be. And he was such, such, a good friend to Evelyn. Everybody needs a friend like Harry. He was such a good edition to the book, I cannot even- I won’t ever stop fangirling about him, that much you can be sure of. Celia: While I loved the romance between her and Evelyn, Celia was perhaps the one likeable character who I didn’t like. I liked her in the beginning. I liked her when she was nice, when she was kind, when she and Evelyn were in love and every moment was bliss. So when did I not like her? I didn’t like her when she was angry. you might be thinking, “well of course you didn’t like her when she was angry! Nobody likes anyone when they’re angry!” No. You don’t understand. Celia was a fucking Devil when she was angry. let me explain. ⚠︎︎spoilers below⚠︎︎Sure, it’s normal to say things you don’t mean when you’re upset, but it’s not normal to verbally abuse people because of it. You should not call your lover a whore because she slept with someone else to protect you. You should not tell your girlfriend that she “is nothing but a nice pair of tits” because you have a small disagreement (I don’t remember about what.) *spoilers have ended*These things are not okay, and that is why I hate Celia st James. *ends rant*Monique: ahhh, monique. Was I the only one who felt like Monique didn’t really get much time in the book? Which is weird, considering she was our main character in the present. This makes it hard for me to form any strong opinions on her, but what I got from the book was that she was pretty much just a regular person. Just a girl, living her life like any other, doing her job to make money. I didn’t feel like I really got to know her all that well, but I liked having her there and I wish her the best. THE RELATIONSHIPSI have never seen relationships depicted so well in a story before. it seems as if the author has lived through every kind of relationship ever. I don’t know how she can possibly get everything so on point. There were so many relationships in this book, I don’t think I can possibly name them all. It’s giving me a headache just thinking about it. Seven husbands, one wife, many friendships. It’s a lot. I’ll just mention a few of them, the few that I remember the most.Celia and Evelyn (ofc): I know I said I didn’t like Celia, and that’s true, but I loved the relationship between her and Evelyn. It wasn’t perfect. No, it was very, very flawed. They fought many times, they broke up, but most heartbreaking, they had to hide. they couldn’t show themselves for who they truly were because they were afraid of what people would do, what people would say. It might have been better for them if they (especially Evelyn) hadn’t cared so much about fame. Maybe then they would’ve showed the world who they really were, a lesbian woman and a bisexual woman, madly in love. Maybe then they could’ve been happier, maybe then they could’ve had more time. But I will treasure the time that they did have, because it was beautiful and stunning and incredible. Evelyn and Harry: this is honestly one of the best friendships I have ever read in a book. The way they always support each other, the way they are always there when the other needs them... i love these two so much. They warmed every inch of my icy heart. As they said themselves, I think Evelyn and Harry are soulmates, in a way. I hope they find each other in the afterlife and have the time of their lives.  what a beautiful, precious friendship they had. Evelyn and Don: unlike the other two relationships I’ve mentioned, this was ugly. there was nothing beautiful or wholesome about it. maybe at the very start, but it certainly didn’t stay that way for long. It wasn’t pleasant reading about this relationship, because it was so wrong and disgusting, but it was also complicated and in-depth, and I thought TJR did a spectacular job at portraying this kind of abusive relationship. My heart breaks for Evelyn that she had to go through this, but I also think that it taught her many things and it really helped shape her as a person. THE WRITINGI think you can already guess that the writing in this book was done perfectly. There’s really not much to say other than that. TJR doesn’t seem to have a very specific writing style, but god, it’s so beautiful. beautiful like a-tear-may-have-fallen-out-of-my-eye beautiful. I would give quotes, but I don’t want to give spoilers.... and im also just really lazy. But just know that the writing added to the story so much, it would be nothing without TJR’s touch. I am really looking forward to reading more books by her, actually, since this one was so amazingly done. Kudos kudos kudos kudos take all the awards TJR 🏆🎖🥇🏆 i mean it. WRAP UP:I could tell you to read this book, but I think you can gather that from the review. I could tell you that I enjoyed reading The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, but I think I’ve already said that multiple times. I could tell you that it’s a good book, but that would be a lie. it’s nothing short of spectacular. so yes, please read it. it’s amazing, and our society has needed it so badly for so long. on that note, i will end my review so you can go start this book right now. yes, you.tw for domestic abuse, suicide, death of loved ones, biphobia, etc"

The dynamic between her and Evelyn was excellent, one of my favourite parts of this novel. I absolutely loved the way this story unfolded. We get to experience Monique interviewing Evelyn Hugo and learn about Evelyn’s past through Monique’s eyes. Monique’s perspective added a more personal and emotional touch to the narrative. Evelyn’s character was fantastic - I loved her confidence and ‘take me as I am’ personality!I was hesitant in starting this novel as it was one of my most highly anticipated reads. I always worry that my expectations may be set too high when starting a book with so much hype surrounding it. I was thrilled to find out this far exceeded any expectations I could have set upon it. It easily earned a spot on my Favourites List. It is a MUST READ! This was my first read by this author and I am excited to read more from her.This was a Traveling Friends Read that we all LOVED! "

I have to say I did not think I would pick this book up because it is not the normal book that I read. I was looking for LGBT books because I was doing whatever you want a thon, so I added this book to my June Book of the Month book box. I have to say that I loved this book would be an understatement. The characters are not super lovable, but the story just pulled me into it. The twist at the end I did not see coming, and I cried while reading the last little bit of this book. This book brings light to so many important things, and it shows us how much things changed since the 1980's.

115,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/143417957-misty-marie-harms,Rating 5 out of 5,"I wasn't expecting to love this book as much as I did. Evelyn was definitely ahead of her time in the way she lived her life. I was torn between hating her and feeling empathy. Back in the day, it was hard for women to be taken seriously and have a career. Then to throw in there her being bisexual in a time when it was illegal, I can't even begin to understand the fear they lived in. My uncle came out in 1991 as a gay man, and it was hard on him. To watch him struggle to be accepted broke my heart. At the end of the day, I think Evelyn did the best she could under a judgmental society. The friendship between her and Harry was beautiful. I cried my way through the last few chapters. He deserved so much better. Excellent read!"

Once I started it, just couldn't put it down until the end. What I learnt is that it's okay to go to any lengths to get what you want. Because otherwise, the regret you would have to live with is gonna be huge on your conscience. Obviously, then being a woman complicates things further. If you really love something/someone, you have to break every rule and go tangent to every circle in order to get it/them. Life is tough on all of us. But love, passion and dreams are something that make it worth living. A good book in my view."

121,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13615165-marta-the-book-slayer,Rating 1 out of 5,"I just don’t get it? I read as many reviews as I could but nothing about this book makes me feel that it is worth five stars. Evelyn at one point in the book describes herself as “...self involved, so singularly focused, that I rarely took time to think of the people out there like myself.” The words self involved are the only words I would use to describe Evelyn. She had a tough childhood but the book seemed to skip over this and focus on her rise to fame. This book had potential. Her first marriage was upsetting. I think it was reality that many face in Hollywood, that needed addressing and I was truly happy when Evelyn decided to leave her first husband. From this point forward the book takes a drastic downward spiral. Cecelia, as blunt and cruel as she may be, is too good for Evelyn. I was happy for them in the beginning of their relationship but very quickly self involved Evelyn had to ruin it by sleeping with the most random character. Her and Cecilia kept getting drawn to each other but I just wasn’t invested in this relationship anymore. Maybe I’m a tough critic and a cynic when it comes to a person cheating on you (this is what I believe Evelyn did), but the idea of going back to someone that is toxic is not romantic nor appealing to me. Everything Evelyn did, she did for herself. Evelyn is a strong independent Cuban bisexual woman yet she spent majority of the book suppressing these identities. How am I supposed to enjoy reading about a character that constantly describes herself with those traits but is too ashamed about it? Even speaking Spanish for her was too embarrassing and reminded her too much of her childhood. I’m so annoyed with her and so frustrated. She’s so unlikable. She uses her money and her fame and doesn’t give anything back for the majority of the book. Suddenly when three people say they should do something for LGBTQ+, she decides to ride the bandwagon and donate? How am I supposed to like reading about a character that only does things to preserve her public image?Harry Cameron deserved so much better. I wish he never married Evelyn. I wish he could have had a happy life with John. I wish he never got so upset and drunk drove (which is 100% not okay). My biggest issue was when something wasn’t working Evelyn’s way, the author killed off Harry so that they could get together in Spain the way she wanted to originally. The only redeemable quality of this book was Monique finding her independence and confidence. I want Monique to succeed. I was happy when she stood up to David and when she cussed Evelyn out. I would never in a million years forgive a woman who let Harry get off the hook for killing her father. I would want revenge. I would want that man’s reputation to be tanked. I would want Evelyn’s reputation to be ruined. How is it okay for Monique to forgive Evelyn for this? This just seems so unrealistic to me. If it wasn’t evident by my very long and angry review, I hated this book. I don’t understand why there are over 60 people waiting for a copy. I feel like I wasted my time. I wish that I could go back in time and never place a hold on this book in the first place. "

Eine Sucht und ein pompöser Gedankenfilm, gefüllt mit dem Glamour des analogen Hollywoods, der 50er/60er/70er/80er und voll von Evelyn, einer legendären Filmsirene und Sexbombe, von der man nur allzu gerne glauben möchte, dass sie wirklich existiert hat. Der Erzählstil, Evelyn und … einfach alles an dem Buch war schonungslos, direkt, arglos, dreist, mutig, stark, arrogant, übergeschnappt, zynisch, ehrlich, zärtlich, ermutigend und selbstbestimmt. Ich liebe Evelyn Hugo. Und Harry Cameron. Den brillanten, gutherzigen, gequälten Harry Cameron. 🥲❤️Keine Ahnung, wann ich zuletzt so geweint hab beim Lesen. Ich hasse und vergöttere Taylor Jenkins Reid für dieses Buch. Freue mich jetzt schon auf den Reread. Und auf den Film. So schnell werde ich die Figuren und Evelyns Leben nicht wieder vergessen.

When you realize you can tell someone your truth when you can show yourself to them when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”  Utter brilliance!!! The hype is worth it guys.  One of my Goodreads friends Sakshi Dabhade quoted it as a 'TREASURE',  and I kid you not she is goddamn right!  The only part I regretted was pushing this book away for months and not picking it up sooner. I am guilty of judging it by its title. I guess because I thought it to be some fluffy, gossipy romance set in the golden Hollywood era. But, no, it was way too different! I found it almost unbelievable to think of Evelyn Hugo not as a real person while reading, it's that good. Evelyn Hugo, you beautiful complex queen! What a wild ride! A very excellent, mesmerizing, complicated, stunning, beautiful book. And guys let us take a moment of silence to appreciate this absolutely-beautiful-lovely-stunning cover?!

127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721595-melissa-semi-hiatus-due-to-work,Rating 2 out of 5,"There's no doubt that Reid is a talented writer; her prose is powerful and keeps the reader engaged throughout. Parts of the storyline, however, come across as preachy about LGB relationships. The main character doesn't care who she lies to, cheats on, hurts, or even covers up a murder for, if it means ""being true to herself"". It is fast-paced with interesting characters, and the details from old Hollywood make Evelyn seem like she could be a real person. It's worth a read if one can sift through the heavy-handed contrived plot and some very detailed sexual exploits to find the core story. Let me be clear here: I have no problem reading books featuring LGBT themes and relationships. I just feel like the synopsis gives no clues as to what this book is really about, and lest future readers get blindsided, I think it's fair to give clear warning. If you have to resort to subterfuge to get readers to pick up a book, then why get mad at someone who points that fact out to others? Hollywood legend Evelyn Hugo is nearing 80 and decides to write her life story. She hires newcomer journalist Monique Grant for the job, and no one is more surprised about it than Monique. Evelyn will not take ""no"" for an answer, and says that if Monique won't tell the story, it will just die with her. As the story of Evelyn's life begins to unfold, Monique discovers that the public persona of Evelyn with her seven husbands does not even touch the surface of the real person behind it. The more Evelyn talks, the more is revealed about her life and loves."

This book is what would happen in the dark of night at the Barnes & Noble if the shittiest romance novel in the store brushed up against Elizabeth Taylor’s autobiography (I’m assuming here she has one) and those two books somehow had a book baby. And that book baby was born on a stack of US Weekly Magazines and so some of that smut rubbed off on the horrible book baby.I recommend you read this awful thing only so you can honestly give it the one star rating it deserves.

129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112077278-eliana,Rating 2 out of 5,"Breaking my silence because it’s been four months and I can’t stop thinking about how bad this book is and how much its huge popularity baffles me. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo single-handedly destroyed any faith I had in Booktok, Goodreads, and Booktube. This is, without a doubt, the most unpopular opinion I’ll ever express on this app, considering this book has near universal acclaim from both readers and critics alike. But I’m clueless. Clueless. I can’t be bothered to be eloquent so I’m just going to list the things I disliked.— The representation.Somebody please tell me what the point of Monique’s character was? I ADORE good representation but hers was a bland, clunky example of tokenism. Her character, independent of race, was unnecessary and flat-out boring. Evelyn’s story didn’t need to be framed, and Monique's sections felt tedious to wade through. As a woman of colour in Old Hollywood, sadly, Evelyn’s story would be rife with obstacles, but Taylor Jenkins Reid erases history, and mostly ignores the existence of racism. Frankly, I'm not sure why Evelyn was Latina, considering how feeble her representation felt.Honestly, TJR's depiction of race and sexuality was one the things that irked me most; because despite a clumsy attempt at being 'deep', her observations lack depth and feel forced. There's nothing you'll read that you can't find on leftist twitter with a quick google search. I think a straight white cis woman could write a gay black trans man well provided she had done the right research—I don't believe in restricting what people can write about, but Taylor Jenkins Reid seems to have done anything but.—The writingThe writing felt bland, lacking in any sort of subtlety. Taylor Jenkins Reid might as well have hit you over the head with a mallet to introduce you to her themes. It's supposed to be 1950s/60s Hollywood but the setting is very, very underdeveloped; from the way the characters spoke and thought, their dialogue could have easily been regurgitated from an Instagram post. I mean, sure, this is decent ‘turn your brain off at the door’ reading but when you think about Evelyn’s situation for more than five seconds you want to laugh at how wildly unrealistic it is.—The plot/characters Aside from Harry, I cared little about the characters. Celia and Evelyn are supposed to be this great sapphic romance but they felt so wooden and surface-level, especially considering the vast majority of their interactions were arguments fuelled by miscommunication. It’s a boring sort of insta love with no clarification as to why Evelyn actually loves Celia in the first place. Celia being angry over Evelyn's reluctance to give up everything's she's ever known was just baffling.Everyone except for Evelyn and Harry felt like a stock character to some extent. Even Evelyn—we were constantly told just how charismatic and groundbreaking she was but I didn’t feel any of it. It was all tell, no show. Admittedly, the concept is phenomenal (hence, I gave two stars), but the manner in which it was executed felt very clunky and poorly-done. And don't even get me started on that god-awful plot twist."

It's only when Monique gets there, that Evelyn tells her that she can have her entire true life story, seven husbands and all!What follows is a record of what Evelyn shares with Monique, it's raw, feels real, and is as wonderful as it is devastating; the interview has interludes that follow Monique back into her personal life; and entertainment media articles after the chapters (events) they reported on. Ultimately her recollections are built around how homosexual and bi-sexual people in the public eye managed to live their lives and still pursue same sex relationships. When I step back and look at it, it's pretty horrifying having to not only hide who you are, but to pretend to be someone else. And we now know that this is indeed what happened to multiple people in the limelight, in the 20th century!. As Evelyn unashamedly shares how she ascended in Hollywood and went through seven husbands, dealing with the world on her own terms to protect her true self and her small family of real friends, it begins to influence Monique's decisions in her own life!This book is a reality check. A reality check on the price of fame. A reality check on how far we have to go on gender equality. A reality check on just how dangerous privilege is to those around them, and powerful it can be if wielded like how Evelyn wielded her hard earned privilege. This book is one-woman's uncompromising story, and it's brilliant because she stands by her actions and who she finally became. Evelyn Hugo knows that when her memoir is published, no one will remember the seven husbands, they'll remember Evelyn Hugo. You might hate Evelyn after reading her story, but you would have needed to have loved her to do so.image source: artsbylys on TumblrThis book is yet another ridiculously well crafted character build, and driven, study of talented people in the limelight; within a few pages I really cared about Monique and wanted to know all about Evelyn, and throughout I was immersed in each decade of her life. What Jenkins has done for me, yet again, is tell the most real fictional love story possible, framing it in the times it's set in seamlessly, and adding in such sweet, and also such damning events that for me, replicate the bumpy road to love that most of those in the limelight seem to go through. I use the word spellbinding, not lightly. 9.5 out of 12, Four Stars. Why not Five Stars?

❥Quotes:


“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.” “Evelyn looks at me with purpose. ""Do you understand what I'm telling you? When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.” “I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.”“Make them pay you what they would pay a white man.” “ You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.” So I fell down. And Harry caught me.” “When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things.”�� People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.” “Imagine if every single woman on the planet wanted something in exchange when she gave up her body. You'd all be ruling the place. An armed populace. Only men like me would stand a chance against you. And that's the last thing those assholes want, a world run by people like you and me.”“Heartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.” “But if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it's time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.”

I am hooked on TJR!I was so excited to read this after recently finishing “Daisy Jones & The Six”, and I couldn’t be happier. Once again, I felt like I was watching this fascinating story play out in real time...from the 1960’s to 2017. How does TJR write characters and storylines that seem so real?! Evelyn Hugo, her life, and her career are so believable that I almost want to look her up on IMDB to see if this is really a biography disguised as fiction. After seven husbands, when Evelyn is asked who the love of her life is, you will not be expecting the answer. I knew very little about the plot before diving in, and I found the whole book to be engrossing, powerful, and moving. Like “Daisy...”, this one will stay with me for a long time.

Sometimes a book would have some emotional effect on me but never to the extent of tears. 2. I don’t care for the ’50s nor do I care about Hollywood actresses. This is all to say I loved this book and did in fact cry while reading this book. 5 times in total and I can imagine myself bawling in class for the next week thinking about Evelyn. The seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo follows Monique, a writer turned journalist, who is given the bizarre opportunity to interview Evelyn Hugo, an old Hollywood icon. Through Evelyn's reminiscent storytelling we learn the ups and downs of her life and of course, her seven husbands. This book was truly amazing. Learning about Evelyns life turned me into a tiny ball of emotions. The story - There’s truly something about knowing so much about Evelyns life before actually- learning about Evelyn's life that makes this story as beautiful as it is. We knew how her story would end right at the start, it was a matter of connecting the dots from there. Something about this abstract mode of storytelling had me hooked from the very beginning. Everlyn and Celia; I want what they have. They work so well together in an odd yet cohesive manner. I Ship!! 🥺Though I would die for Evelyn and Celias’ relationship, I wasn’t head over heels for Celia herself. To put it simply, she was selfish. This is obviously up for interpretation but I believe Celia didn’t have it in her to see the bigger picture. Every stump in the metaphorical road that was Evelyn and Celias relationship, Celia thought would end their relationship. Whereas on the flip side, Evelyn isn’t as selfish as everyone believes her to be. She valued her relationship with Celia and valued a lot of other things as well. These values were ultimately her demise time and time again in their relationship. If there was anything I learnt from this story, it was this: life is too short to be worrying about others opinions. Live your life, love who you want and don’t be ashamed of who you are. 💓I didn’t use my usual rating rubric because this is easily a 5-star read 🌟 ~~~I’m at a loss for words... this was grandeur.

But we are the chosen ones because we are extraordinary.”- i loved this! it basically felt like a watching a sad documentary. i cried so much at the end!- i have always been interested in the drama and scandal of hollywood, and this book packed in a lot of other themes that made it a good read overall!- the writing isn’t the strongest point of the story, but there’s nothing wrong with it. it’s very simple and there’s a very modern appeal to her writing that i love. - all of TJR’s characters are fierce and utterly human and in my opinion, the best part of her books.- evelyn hugo  has both flaws and strengths. she isn’t perfect, but still a strong and admirable character. she’s definitely a realist and doesn’t rely too heavily on feelings, and honestly i kinda am too! - the lives of famous people are beyond my understanding. but what i can take from reading this is that happiness is redefined in hollywood. evelyn hugo struggles with finding love. relationships are merely a status in her world, and it can be really lonely. - i did like the exploration of sexuality, it added a lot more depth to evelyn’s character. ”I think being yourself—your true, entire self—is always going to feel like you’re swimming upstream.”- aside from celia, the strongest connection had to be with harry cameron. it was the most intimate, since he was present for her whole life. he was mostly the reason for why i cried so much. it’s sad that he never got a a chance to live as his true self. - by the end i felt myself feeling sad for her, but i also admired her character development and how strong she became. im glad she used her experience to help other women before her passing. - and finally, monique: an independent, admirably ambitious young woman. she had lived a very straightforward life, progressing in her career until she ended up with a life-changing opportunity at her disposal. she has never quite craved success until meeting evelyn hugo. - i found monique’s side of the story a little boring. obviously, it’s hard to compare to evelyn’s elaborate life, but i never really looked forward to reading monique’s parts of the story. she had some good development though and i was intrigued by the mystery of why evelyn hugo chose her to write her story. - monique posed a foil for evelyn’s character which i appreciated. monique does not come to decisions as easily as evelyn does. she does not think it is that easy to achieve success. but as the story progressed, and she learned more about evelyn hugo, she learned how wield power as a woman. things will not come to you, you must go after them!”Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?””Nobody deserves anything. It’s simply a matter of who’s willing to go and take it for themselves.”- i loved the way this book was structured. each part of the book is named after one of her 7 husbands and it helps with the pacing so much. i expected this to be a slower read, but it surprisingly went by very quickly! the chapters were very short. i was always looking forward to hearing more of evelyn’s stories. - as for the book itself, it was enjoyable. but it doesn’t go past that. this isn’t a book i will think about for days, and that’s mostly the reason i didn’t give it 5 stars. as real as the characters seem, there’s still a shallowness to them that makes them less memorable. - overall, it is story you’ll find yourself invested in. i was constantly wondering what would happen next in evelyn hugo’s life. it’s great for people who are interested in the drama of pop culture. please read!"

This is an incredibly quick and entertaining story with a great message about love and embracing one’s sexual identity.The story follows Evelyn Hugo, a 1960s Hollywood starlet best known for her sex appeal and her scandalous seven marriages. Now 79, Evelyn is finally willing to do a “tell-all” article for a popular magazine and let the whole world know the true story of her life.One of the hallmarks of a good author is their ability to craft characters that are flawed, complex, and authentic. Taylor Jenkins Reid absolutely does that – and then some – with Evelyn. Evelyn is incredibly ambitious, charismatic, and talented; she knows exactly what she wants and she isn’t afraid to hurt people if it means she comes out on top. At times her ruthlessness made her a bit difficult to like, but she felt so hauntingly real that at times it’s easy to forget she’s fictional.The various cultural references to the 1960s were fascinating and well-written. Evelyn is clearly based in part by Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor. Taylor Jenkins Reid does an excellent job of showing the hardships that women had to overcome and the sacrifices that they had to make to become famous in that era.At times the plot felt a little tedious because the same three things happened repeatedly – Evelyn makes a mistake that causes her lover Celia to be angry with her; they separate for a little while; then they get back together. This formulaic process made the book feel devoid of any tension or suspense; everything was straightforward and rather predictable.Ultimately, this book is enjoyable but rather simple and one-dimensional. It lacks the nuance and complexity necessary for it to truly be memorable. It is a typical love story and nothing much more than that. While it is fast-paced and fun to read, it doesn’t really leave a strong impression or cause any kind of deep contemplation. "

139,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra,Rating 5 out of 5,"4. 5 starsWho was the Great love of your life?Such a wonderful, mesmerizing read that had a twist at the end that I did not see coming! What can I say, I loved it! An intelligent and engrossing look at fame and at what cost will one pay to achieve it? Evelyn Hugo reminded me of Elizabeth Taylor, and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Old Hollywood glamour. Evelyn Hugo (Evelyn Elena Herrera) is ready and willing to tell her story about her glamorous Hollywood life and various marriages. But there is a catch, as there often is, as she wants Monique Grant, a fairly unknown magazine writer, to tell her story. Why? How does she even know Monique Grant and her writing? The hows and whys don't matter as Monique wants and needs to do this story. Her husband, David has left her and she needs the piece to further her career.Monique sits with Evelyn in her Upper East side apartment while Evelyn tells her how she went from living in Hell's Kitchen to being one of the top paid actresses of her generation. She tells how she loved and lost, how she got to Hollywood, how she married and divorced, and how she rose to fame, how she lived a secret life. Evelyn is smart, witty, and determined. She has lived a full life and has gained a lot of wisdom and success. She is a flawed and like-able character as are most of the other characters in her life.I do not want to give too much of this book away. What I will say is that it is well written and dripping with glamour. This book is so atmospheric and I could see the ladies dressed in their gowns at all the important award shows and after parties. Fame has a price, as they say, and Evelyn pays hers in this book. This is a story of one's woman's rise to fame but it is also a love story. I'm so glad that I read this book - I almost didn't. I have a lot of books I was asked to read for reviews and this one came from the library. I had it sitting on my table and knew it was coming due. I kept looking at it sitting there. I kept wondering..should I read this or not? Do I have time to read this? The answer was ""No"" but I though...maybe. I decided that I would read a few pages, if I liked it, I WOULD finish it, if not back to the library it would go. Needless to say I was hooked. This is my first book by Taylor Jenkins Reid but it will not be my last.See more of my reviews at www.openbookposts.com"

It´s all haywire and folks believe what they are told in media. Stars love exposure, stars hide from exposure - this is the contradictory world they live in. Especially, Evelyn Hugo, a powerful, manipulative, talented, strong, deceitful personality who knew best how to use the media, living all her life in strategic chess moves to ultimately run free with the love of her life. The plot was nothing what I expected 🫢! A captivating novel from start to end! High five to all my valued book-friends who have enjoyed this read as much as I have!

I enjoyed this book a lot especially Evelyn's life story. I just kind of could have done without Monique to be quite honest. Like every time we moved back into the present day I was kind of annoyed and wanted to get back to Evelyn. I don't think the twist itself added much to the story and in comparison to everything else, it felt like I saw it coming and it was sort fo anticlimactic. I really felt the ending was weaker than the rest of the book, but alas that's what I say almost every time I read something. Definitely loved the book overall. "

Now I wish I was born in the 1950s in Hollywood. (aand another dream. *sigh*. They always grow, like my tbr 🤓)Finished this book at nearly 3am. If that doesn't prove how good it was, I don't know what else could convince you to read it. So let me talk a bit about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. 
“I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.” - Evelyn Hugo
Half of the book I was trying to understand Evelyn. The other half I was reading (crazy, I know) and hoping that - against all my knowledge - Evelyn, Harry, Connor, John and Celia would have a happy end. Evelyn's story felt so real, this whole book felt so real, it is truly incredible. I acutally wrote: ""Please not. Let this book end here, when they are all together and happy"", next to: 
""It was one of the last times we were all together, laughing, smiling, happy. A family. Because after that, I ruined it."" - page 259
Evelyn WHY 😩 -I couldn't really LOVE Evelyn, but she did fascinated me a lot.I also hated her. All the pain she got through was horrible, but all the horrible things she did to other people? - I hated her for that. She had her reasons - I know - but it lead me to not be able love her like I love many book characters.Yes, her doing made her ""more"" human and real for me. I liked that Evelyn didn't romanticize what she did. That she didn't say: ""I did all of this just for love."" Because she knew she didn't. And it's human. To be selfish. To do the wrong thing. It made her seem real. Nonetheless I hated and was sad about what she did.  Same goes with Cecilia. Their relationship felt so real - all the up and downs. I loved them together, but I also hated them together. The way they hurt each other. Ouch. Reading that was very painful.Celia and Evelyn loved each other so deeply. Only the way Evelyn talked about her made clear how deep their love was. They wasted so many years through their arguments and stubbornness. :((I have to write about my favourite character, too. About HIM. Harry.
“You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until somewhat stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.” - Evelyn
Harry was the sweetest, loyal and loving. He wasn't flawless. Obviously nobody is. But he always supported Evelyn, helped her and loved her. The scenes with him and Connor? Adorable.When he died, I kinda wanted the book to stop, to undo what just had happend.The last words Evelyn said to him really catched me. It was very sad and sweet.
“But if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it's time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.”
 Ahhh it's. just. sad.To conclude, this story was incredible written and good. Never gonna stop thinking about Harry and co 😢"

Ellos son ficticios, sus historias fueron inventadas, pero entonces ¿porqué siento que realmente los conocí? Conozco cada uno de sus secretos, sé cómo caminan, cómo se enfrentarían a cierta situación, cuál es la definición de amor para ellos, quién es su verdadera familia, tengo sus voces presentes, y ¿me dices que todo eso jamás pasó?Aunque esta sensación llega a ser dolorosa, a mí me satisface mucho, porque sé que he leído un buen libro, que sentí que realmente viajaba entre cada letra y no era una espectadora, por momentos era la protagonista, otros era el personaje secundario y en otros era el terciario, pero en todo momento estuve ahí. No estuve leyendo, estuve acompañando a Evelyn Hugo en su vida, conociéndola, ayudándola a ocultar sus secretos, a destapar los demás, a amar, a llorar, a disfrutar, a querer ganar un Oscar.Decir que me gustó es poco."
145,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44279580-tracy,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is yet another pause-resistant work of spellbinding mastery by the truly gifted wordsmith Taylor Jenkins Reid. I have never found a book by her that I wanted to end and was not extraordinarily impactful. In this novel I laughed, cried and cheered as I flowed along with the amazing characters of old Hollywood - for their trials, tribulations, joys and grief. What it really all comes down to is that no matter what our stature in society, or wealth, we all just want to love and be authentically loved, and without this all the other things are essentially meaningless. Narrators Alma Cuervo, Julia Whelan and Robin Miles were flawless in bringing this dynamic cast of characters to life in brilliant form."

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⚠️Trigger Warning: Sexual Harassment/Asault, Sexual Relationship with a Minor, Explicit Content, Abortion, Death⚠️❗This review contains some spoilers❗I am utterly, irrevocably wrecked! This is the kind of book that you never move on from, the kind you carry with you forever. I can't believe I've had this masterpiece sitting on my shelf for about two-three years before picking it up. Why do I keep doing this with all the books that end up changing my life? I don't even know where to begin describing the magnificence of this book. The plot? Absolutely incredible. Few people can create something this beautiful and make it work so wonderfully. The story? It is one of the most incredible stories I've ever read in my life. Not to mention all the plot twists that blew my mind to pieces, as if the story itself isn't wasn't enough to do it. It is modern literature at its peak.Furthermore, I am so ridiculously, unconditionally in love with Evelyn Hugo, it's not even a joke. She is a spectacular character, a force to be reckoned with. She's deeply complicated, with her strength, cunning, compassion, and willingness to do literally anything to get what she wants. She knows the price, she's ready to pay it, even if it hurts her or those she loves, and she is completely, and shamelessly unapologetic for it. Yes, most of these are red flags but in that classic Evelyn Hugo influence she has on people her personality only makes you admire her even more. It makes her a badass, a strong woman. Loving her isn't an option, just something that she wrings right out of you. From the beginning of the story until its end she has shown the world time and again the sort of power she wields, even if they don't realise it...or especially when they don't realise it. She refuses to quit, especially when it comes to her career, although she was treated little better than Marilyn Monroe. Moreover, Monique Grant may not be as complex of a character as Evelyn, but her presence is significant, nonetheless. That is not simply because she's the one chosen to write Evelyn's memoir, but also to show firsthand the full extent of the effect that Evelyn has on people, even those who she has hurt. Monique is a level-headed, polite, intelligent woman, with a talent for writing and telling the stories that need to be told. However, in the beginning of the story both her personal and work life seem to have reached a dead end. It is only after she meets Evelyn that both aspects of her life kick-start into motion again, and she decides to take what she wants cunningly and unapologetically. That is not where that influence ends, though. In fact, it runs on just a fundamental level that it has affected Monique's life without her even being aware of it until its reveal. This caused her such conflicting feelings in that, even though she hates Evelyn Hugo, she still can't help but admire and respect her.Additionally, the famous seven husbands have left their individual marks on Evelyn's life. Not all of them were adequate. In fact, most of them had failed her so spectacularly, it is making my skin crawl with rage and disdain. She was so often treated like trash, a punching bag, and an object. She was devalued and sexualized by the people she should have been able to rely on. None of that slowed her down, though. If they pushed her down she climbed back up even higher than before. No matter what was done to her, she never wavered. Big fuck you to Don Adler and Max Girard, by the way. ✌🏻✌🏻 Then, there are those who saw her true worth, who loved her deeply and would do anything for her. The best one by far is that sweet angel sent from heaven, Harry Cameron. While their love has never been that of a husband and wife, it runs much deeper than that. Evelyn and Harry have the purest form of friendship and deepest connection anyone can even find in life. It is no wonder he was the one who had a child with her, and the only one she could trust going through this process. In addition, men like Robert Jamison and even Rex North deserve special praise for being absolute treasures even if both marriages were of convenience. While they will never amount to Harry (sorry not sorry) they have a special place in Evelyn's and my heart for being so goddamn supportive of her, throughout the entirety of both marriages.. A bit ironic that the best relationships she's had by far were the platonic ones, huh? 😂😂 Oh...and I feel kind of bad for Ernie Diaz. He was the most gullible out of all of them. Also, that whole Mick Riva ordeal was hysterically tragic. 😅😅 Even so, none of them ever came as close as Evelyn's wife. Evelyn's relationship with Celia St. James is largely rocky and often toxic. There is a lot that keeps them apart and causes them pain, a lot of insecurities and mistrust. The fact that being gay during that time was bad enough for common people, much less celebrities, didn't help them at all. Keeping love hidden is painful enough without having to deal with the price of fame. In spite of that, the love and passion between them are unparallel. Even spending years apart didn't damper their feelings for each other. Both women have made mistakes, and both hurt the other so deeply it left scars, yet their love never died. Honestly, I'm getting emotional just thinking about it. This relationship is as complicated as Evelyn's character. It is both wrong and right.I did not expect to write this much but enjoy! 😊"

“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.”
The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo isn’t just a book, it’s an experience.So I’m already in pain right now so what better way to make yourself suffer than to write a review where you remember everything of this heartbreaking yet beautiful book. There it is, Taylor Jenkins Reid has done it again showing me that five stars aren’t fucking enough for her books. I’m not sure whether I finished this book or this book finished me.Now let’s talk about the impeccable plot, shall we?“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.”The book is about Evelyn Hugo, an aging Hollywood icon known for her scandalous affairs and her glamorous life. And now she has finally decided to tell the truth of her life and address the rumors when she suddenly appoints Monique Grant to write her biography.Monique is a small writer but this opportunity of a lifetime came knocking at her door which can help jumpstart her career by a great fold. As Monique listens to Evelyn narrate her tragic, beautiful, scandalous life all the way from the beginning when she came to Los Angeles in the 1950s, she feels a deeper connection with the star but as Evelyn’s story comes to the conclusion, it becomes clearer that Monique’s life intersects with Evelyn in a tragic way.Now the characters in this book, the brutally flawed, broken, happy, and sad characters that made this book so iconic and depressing that I can’t seem to be able to forget about them. From the start we know that everyone is going to die as now that everyone is dead, Evelyn is finally telling her story but every single time a person died, I was dumbfounded and felt like a part of my heart had been stripped away because I had already connected with the characters so much that I didn’t want to part ways.""They are just husbands. I am Evelyn Hugo. And anyway, I think once people know the truth, they will be much more interested in my wife.”This book is about Evelyn Hugo and Taylor Jenkins Reid wants you to know that because Evelyn is not a character who can be pushed to the sidelines, wherever she stands she makes her mark thus making herself the most iconic bitch who won’t hesitate in taking whatever she wants. I just love Evelyn a lot. You can’t hate Evelyn, you just can’t even if you wanted to. The way she unconditionally loved Celia and would do anything for her was breathtakingly beautiful“I spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much I loved her.”Celia St. James was the love of Evelyn’s life. Celia is a complex character even though I truly understand the reasons behind the way she acted as she did, I couldn’t help but be frustrated with her decisions. But real people are flawed and make mistakes which only makes Celia feel like a real person, her pain, her suffering, her love all felt deep and meaningful.“Harry was my greatest friend. He invented me. He was the person who loved me the most unconditionally. The person I loved the most purely, I think. Other than my daughter. But no, he was not the love of my life.“Harry Cameron is one of the characters in this book that you just can’t help but fall in love with. He’s too precious to me and his friendship with Evelyn was one of the greatest things that happened. I truly adored his character and personality, the way he cares about Evelyn, and the people he loves. Harry and Evelyn are platonic soulmates their friendship made me beyond happy and broke me at the same time.Some of the husbands in this book were assholes and I wanted to kill them. The husbands I hated the most were Don Adler, Mick Riva, and Max Girard, others were more or less fine. I don’t have much to say about them other than they are assholes and do not deserve to live.“Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”The writing in this book was absolutely gorgeous. I marvel at how Taylor Jenkins Reid makes her characters feel so real, flawed, broken yet lovable and amazing. I adore her writing, it’s quite atmospheric.“It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.”By the end of this book, I felt broken, lost, and empty. It brought out every single emotion in me. I felt a surge of separation as I finished this book. The plot twist at the end yet again destroyed me, I was not ready for the pain this book brought me. I’m in awe of this book. It truly is a masterpiece. From the highly addicting tone of this book to the everlasting impact it holds on you, this book is one to be remembered through the ages._____________________Thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid for breaking me in the most heartwrenching and beautiful way possible. My heart is in pain, the end pages of my copy of this book are wet due to the searing pain this caused me, My heart is so heavy that I can't even think of anything else.Buddy read with Bhavya, Aashi, Ishika, Blobbie, Bonnie and Aazra. 💕______________________This year is Taylor Jenkins Reid's year...I swear almost all my friends here on gr are reading her books AS THEY SHOULD!!!"
153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17119647-noah,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is one of those books that puts you into a deep foggy haze after finishing it. Honestly, my mind is still reeling. What a spectacular book! Every word on every page captivated me. And while I do think there’s a twist in the book that I don’t really think stuck the landing, that’s hardly important compared to the parts that I loved. I loved how it pulled the veil from the self-congratulatory and self-important nature of Hollywood. And I loved how wonderful of a character Evelyn Hugo was. Despite the fact that her clever and callous nature often made her seem cold and unfeeling, I couldn’t help but admire her for it all the same. I also loved how she dealt with her “bi-awakening,” because it wasn’t an awakening for her, it was something that was always there, as constant as breathing. Sometimes it’s not a big moment. Sometimes it’s just something you always knew, but never knew, you know?I loved how the book reminded me of The Song of Achilles. Mostly in that the main characters had to choose between legendary fame and quiet happiness. And in both books, the characters figured out the hard way that false glamour and the masks that they had to put on were not worth it compared to the moments in-between spent with the ones they loved. For Evelyn Hugo, this is shown in how she felt it regretful, but necessary to erase both her sexual identity and racial identity in order to survive. And finally, what I loved most of all was how this book wasn't about the terrible things that had to be done in order to maintain an egotistical façade, but rather the pockets of happiness that a queer person was able to find along the way in an unforgiving life. And yet, I still don’t feel like I’ve said it enough! I loved this book!“And I started crying when I realized those men and women were willing to fight for a dream I had never even allowed myself to envision. A world where we could be ourselves, without fear and without shame. They were braver and more hopeful than I was. There were simply no other words for it.”"

I will stand in there and read a bunch of them cover to cover. I love it. Something about those juicy stories that you think 'they can't be true, right', something about getting the glimpse of the stars and the outrageous stories, it's a guilty pleasure. Reading this one by Talylor Jenkins Reid, gave me that same wonderful, guilty pleasure feeling. But this one, I enjoyed so much more.This was my first Traveling Sister Group Read and it was so much fun discussing this one with everyone. Here you learn the life story of starlet Evelyn Hugo. From when she was very young living in NYC, to making her move to Hollywood, and through her yes, seven husbands. It was quite the scandalous read. When I saw early review of this one, I was hooked. And that cover...gorgeous. I don't want to say too much other than to read this one. It truly was a great read that kept me enthralled the entire time. I listened while on the exercise bike and just didn't want to get off, I wanted to keep listening. The audio was very good, winning an ear phones award, and the voice of Evelyn just drew me in like she was talking to me. Not normally the type of book I read. But every now and then, you need a juicy story, that almost borders on 'chick lit'. (Is that wrong to say?) So glad I read this one.For a fab review on how all the 'sisters' felt on this one, you can see the entire review by Brenda.

And I’ll make sure the world understands.”  Evelyn Hugo is an iconic aging actress, famous for her work in the movie industry but also famous for having been married seven times to seven men. Monique Grant is a writer for a magazine, but has been in a bit of a career rut as of lately. On top of that she’s getting divorced, so she jumps on the opportunity to interview the famous Evelyn Hugo. When she meets Evelyn, she discovers Evelyn wants more than a simple article, she wants to tell her life story to Monique for a biography. And Monique is getting the story exclusively.   “I’ve spent a very long time learning how to spin the truth. It’s hard to undo that wiring.”  I absolutely loved this story! Taylor Jenkins Reid has this uncanny ability to suck you into the lives of her characters and never let you go. They feel so utterly genuine, I felt as if I was a part of their lives instead of an outsider reading about them. Reid also does an amazing job developing her characters, I was rooting for all of them to get what they want and to achieve their goals.I never really know what to expect when I dive into a book by Reid, but I can honestly say this book was full of surprises and twists I didn’t see coming. This book spans from the 1950’s to the present day, and we get to know all of the loves of Evelyn’s life. Evelyn herself was enchanting, I found myself fascinated by her life story, her choices and her perseverance. While love was a motivating factor, to me this was mostly a story about success and survival. Evelyn was always going to do what it takes to be a star and stay at the top, and she would fight for what she wanted.Hollywood and the film industry can be a ruthless place but it can also be one where greatness can be achieved for the lucky ones. I think Reid captured the industry and the time periods this story took place in perfectly. This is one of the best books I’ve read all year and I think if you go into it with an open mind and a kind heart, you’ll fall in love with this book like I did.  “If you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything.”   ARC provided by publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review Follow me on ♥ Facebook ♥ Blog ♥ Instagram ♥ Twitter ♥"
158,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69932312-sara,Rating 5 out of 5,"“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.” Well this novel was anything but and i'm so pleased i finally got to read it. I knew this book was going to be good, but i didn't realise it would be this good. This book was hyped to the point where I truly hadn't seen a single negative review for it, and given my track record with super hyped books, i was wary to say the least. I needn't have worried as Taylor Jenkins Reid managed to create not only well written, well developed characters but characters that truly feel like real people. It was refreshing to see a character that isn't overwhelmingly ""good"" and is in fact deeply flawed. Evelyn is selfish, cunning and completely unapologetic. She makes questionable decisions and ruthlessly puts everything on the line to get what she wants but she's also fiercely protective of those she loves and is willing to risk it all for them. Evelyn is very reminiscent of the old Hollywood star and you can't help but compare her to legends like Elizabeth Taylor and Greta Garbo. The story read like tell all about 1950's/1960's Hollywood and was shocking and raw in part.The plot kept me engrossed all the way through, the writing was smooth and everything flowed at a really great pace.Monique made for a great narrator and even though its not real i found myself hoping for the best for her future! Learning about Evelyn's life left me eager to get through the story and see where she ends up. I loved that each husband was representative of a different characterisation and i was very interested in reading about how their relationships panned out however the real draw was Celia. Their story is at once uplifting and heart breaking and you can't help but root for them as a couple and empathise with their relationship issues. The ending left me reeling and i am not too ashamed to admit i sobbed. This is one of those books that i'll always recommend to people asking for a good read and one i'll enjoy forever.

Una historia que, sin ser nada excepcional, se lee con mucho interés, porque además está bien escrita. La historia de Evelyn Hugo, una famosa actriz de la industria de Hollywood, ya en las postrimerías de su carrera, que se sincera con Monique Grant, una periodista bastante desconocida que va a llevarse la historia de su vida, …. A cambio ¿de qué? Podría calificarse de forma llana como una historia de amor en sus diferentes formas y perspectivas. Una historia en la que Evelyn sale airosa, pues he acabado amando a este personaje, a pesar de las numerosas bajezas que muestra a lo largo de la novela. Llegar a donde ha llegado no le ha salido gratis ni ha sido un paseo por el parque. Aunque claro, estamos hablando de una vida dedicada a brillar como una de las más rutilantes estrellas de Hollywood. Contada desde la perspectiva de la propia estrella, pero también desde la de Monique, que sabe que está jugándose su futuro con esta apuesta. Lo que no imagina es que la parte final de la biografía de Evelyn le va a afectar más de lo que ella hubiese supuesto al aceptar el encargo. Ya se lo advierte Evelyn casi al principio: “cuando te cuente mi historia, acabarás odiándome con toda tu alma”. Y no diré más, pues es difícil hablar mucho de la novela sin incurrir en spoilers. Que se lee de forma ligera pero es intensa a la vez. Que es una obra que podría encuadrarse dentro de varios géneros, incluso biografía, pues tiene aspectos muy reales de la vida en el estrellato que estoy seguro están calcados a los de otras muchas figuras del ambiente. Ya he leído unas cuantas biografías de estrellas de cine, y no sabría diferenciar entre realidad y ficción. Con esta novela me pasa igual. Evelyn es un personaje que deja huella, está muy bien descrita y es muy difícil no sentir cierto nivel de empatía con ella . Llega a hacerse adorable. La novela retrata (magníficamente) una época de glamour pero también de escándalos y decadencia. Y de aquí, como en “Todos quieren a Daisy Jones”, se puede sacar material para una magnífica serie también. Muy recomendable."

Eventually.Does this make her a likeable character? That's up to the reader.Based on these questions, does this make for a well-written story? I thought so.Personally, this book felt like a mix of stories between real-life movie-star icons Elizabeth Taylor, Lana Turner and Ava Gardner. I enjoyed the ""behind-the-scenes"" look into the egotistical world of Hollywood and the endless need for awards, accolades and publicity, even through tabloid stories (which many stars encourage!)Note: I easily figured out one of Evelyn's reasons for asking Monique to write her biography; the other, well, I didn't see that one coming!Audiobook thoughts? Well done and enjoyable to follow!"

165,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30268418-tina-haigler,Rating 4 out of 5,"""CAN YOU COME INTO MY office?""First off, I can't say that I loved this book. I spent a bit of it detesting the main character, especially in the beginning. However, it kept my interest and I warmed up to her eventually. I also liked or loved various other characters. So I'm going to say I really enjoyed it. I even wept towards the end, which is never fun, so poop on you Taylor Jenkins Reid. I call foul. I don't like being a blubbering mess.""I hate Evelyn, but I think I like her very much.""Oh Evelyn. Why'd you have to go and do all those awful things? And why do I kind of like you for it?To be honest I think Evelyn might just be the most complex character I've ever come across in literature. Most characters you either love them or you hate them. No in between, but not Evelyn Hugo.""There's Evelyn Hugo for you. Somewhere in the middle.""As far as the numerous other characters, there was a lot of hit or miss. I either loved them, didn't care, or downright despised them. I liked and disliked Evelyn. Monica was ok, but I never really emotionally connected. I liked Celia most of the time but not when she was being dramatic, mean, or acting all high and mighty. Connor was the same as Monica. I never connected. I loved, loved, loved, Harry. I ended up liking four of the husbands, and despising three of them. To find out which ones are which, you'll just have to read the book ;)Well that about sums it up, because talking about anything in depth would require spoilers and that's just not my style. So I'll end this by saying it's a very entertaining read. If Hollywood life, especially the golden age, or salacious scandals are things you enjoy, then I think you'll love everything about this book.""I don't know when exactly it happens--I suspect I made sense of things when I was dreaming--but when I wake up in the morning, I realize that even though it is too early yet, I will, one day, forgive her."""

With its shining 5 star reviews on Goodreads and Amazon, and almost every single one of my friends rating it 5 stars, I had to see what all the fuss was about! I have so many books to read in paper/kindle at the moment, but REALLY wanted to read this one. So I decided to bump it up the list and get it read faster by listening to the audio version. So glad that I did. I think this is the most moving and captivating historical fiction book I have ever had the pleasure to read/listen to! I absolutely adored it!When Monique is contacted to write a biography of the elusive, academy award winning Hollywood icon, Evelyn Hugo - she is shocked! Why has this starlet picked her? She is a seemingly unknown writer. Of course she is excited and jumps at the opportunity, but what scandalous secrets does this iconic celebrity have? Why has she hidden from the public for so long? And why exactly did she choose Monique for this job?Oh my heart!!! What a beautiful story! When I first started reading I assumed it was just going to be a story about seven husbands. And it was, but it was so much more than that. There was so much depth to it. I LOVED the writing! Evelyn gave her secrets away so slowly, and Monique's teasers throughout really made you wonder what on earth was really going on! And although the twist was fairly obvious, or at least partially obvious, you still got swept up in the emotion of it. The story was made up of Evelyn and Monique's perspectives and also made up of snippets of newspaper and magazine articles through the decades. It made the whole thing incredibly entertaining and superbly additive! I found it so hard to pause the audio when I had to! The 50's to 80's Hollywood glamour was so fascinating to read about! The drama behind the spotlight is obviously appealing to so many people, and Evelyn's story pulls at the heart strings and does not let go! It didn't go in the direction I was expecting it to go, and I am so glad. Because I was BLOWN AWAY by this book! By the exquisite story. By Evelyn, her life, the romance/s, friendships and anguish she lived through.Would I recommend The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo?Absolutely!

168,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32799998-erin,Rating 5 out of 5,"Taylor Jenkins Reid is a Old Hollywood fan. You can tell from reading this book. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is part faux memoir part commentary on what life as a Hollywood actress in the 1950's & 60's was like. Evelyn Hugo is jigsaw puzzle that's pieces are slowly put together as you read it. As a Old Hollywood fan I spent this book trying to figure out which real life actresses Evelyn Hugo was based off of. I have a list but I won't reveal it because two of the actresses would be spoilers. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is elegantly written, rich in detail, just really really good. Evelyn Hugo is carefully crafted and I'm kinda mad she's not real because I think she would be in my top five Old Hollywood actresses. If you live for Hollywood gossip read this book. If you love books written for women by women read this book. If you like beautiful, heartbreaking, and captivating stories read this book. Basically everyone read this book."

The author did a terrific job with Evelyn complex character, it was like she took form in my head, she feels real. Her story, her charisma was fascinating you’ll want to know everything about her life as a Hollywood icon. The fact that Evelyn had seven husbands is special enough but really, all her life is. The characters you get to know as she unfold her life story were prodigious, I had a particular affection for Harry. With Reid telling the story, I could feel every emotions she meant the reader to experience.

It uh, yeah, it definitely struck a chord. I thought the subject matter was touching, the relationships tugged at the heartstrings, and the overall message was important. Once I started it, I could not stop, the flow and writing style was so incredibly entrancing. I really had no idea what I was in for. Evelyn's character was incredibly interesting but not relatable at all. She has looks nobody could compete with, steps on just about anyone to get what she wants, and has a generally unkind temperament. But what I did like about her was her unflappable commitment to her family and loved ones. The way in which the author describes detailed emotions makes my heart sing and break at the same time. It's something I can't say I've ever experienced in a book. The characters were just so realistic! I think it's a book with incredible staying power. It's unrelenting and does hold your hand. It has a powerful message and a nail biting plot. I just want to read it all over again. "

This novel tells the story of Evelyn Hugo, a famous Hollywood actress that started her career in the fifties. She's almost 80 years old and wants to have her autobiography written by a relatively-unknown journalist named Monique.  Monique is as astounded as most people are to learn that the highly-successful and reclusive Evelyn Hugo wants her to write the story of Evelyn's life but she agrees and this is the beginning of this remarkable book. The story is told from the points of view of Evelyn and Monique and alternates between the present and the past. The writing is beautiful and Evelyn Hugo is an amazing character, I am so glad I got to spent some time getting to know her. The novel is engaging, complex as well as entertaining. Overall I loved the book and highly recommend it to all."
176,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin,Rating 5 out of 5,"After plowing my way through the Daisy Jones and the Six, I was excited to learn that Tara Jenkins Reid has written other books, and that somehow I’ve just been living under a rock (figuratively) and just completely missed this book (literally). Like Daisy Jones, Evelyn Hugo is a powerfully- written, captivating, and memorable female lead. This book spans several decades, and its backdrop is the Hollywood film industry (and if there is anything I love besides books and music, it’s movies) so I was here just for that whole movie industry thing, just like I was there listening to Daisy Jones for the whole music industry thing. Yes, there is a lot of Hollywood. Yes, there are (literally) seven husbands that each get their fifteen minutes of fame here. But, holy guacamole, so much more is packed into these pages that I was not expecting at all, and I really don’t want to tell you what other themes are in here. I don’t really want to tell you what directions this story goes. I really just want you to pick it up, knowing it’s written by a very capable author, and just roll with it. Don’t overthink it. Don’t try to get ahead of it. Just turn the pages (after reading the words on said pages first, obviously). Man, this plot is just expertly pieced together, in my opinion. There are two different timelines, and they both unfold into a very dramatic, unsettling, jaw-dropping ending. One of the greatest things reading can do is make us more empathetic and understanding. This one, while absolutely just an entertaining book to kick back and read, also challenged me. It grabbed my hand and pulled me into a different world that, while fictional, felt all too real. Reid provided me with a reading experience I will not be forgetting anytime soon. Her characters were all full of life and jumped off the page. I sometimes found myself out there in California, or New York, or France, or Spain, or wherever the story went. I was lost in the setting, stumbling around trying to find my own agent, trying to land my own small part in a commercial or something. I really didn’t expect to love this book as much as I did, but it exceeded my expectations. It is a beautifully-written novel that was more than simply a great fiction novel. It pushed me outside of my box (figuratively) and forced itself deep into my brain so that the story and the emotions it packed with it will stick around for a while (literally)."

En un inicio pensé que bien podría ser un libro de misterio debido a que en las primeras páginas te comentan que todos los esposos ya murieron y no tienes idea de por qué Evelyn eligió a la escritora con la que inicia la historia. Sin embargo, mientras avanza, quedé completamente atrapada por razones diferentes.The Seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo nos narra la historia de Monique, una escritora en sus treintas que está pasando por una ruptura amorosa y una carrera que se encuentra caminando en línea horizontal. De manera sorpresiva, su jefa en la revista en la que trabaja la manda llamar. ¿El motivo? Evelyn Hugo, una actriz icónica desde los 50s, ha decidido darle a la revista una entrevista y, por razones que desconocemos, específicamente pidió que Monique fuera quien se encargue de la entrevista. De no ser Monique, Evelyn simplemente no lo hará. Monique es entonces enviada a la casa de la legendaria Evelyn en la ciudad de Nueva York. Ahí, Evelyn, quien ahora está en una edad bastante avanzada, le revela el verdadero motivo por el cual contactó a la revista: Quiere hacer un libro sobre su vida contando absolutamente todo lo que ocurrió y quiere que Monique sea quien escriba ese libro y se quede con las regalías una vez que Evelyn muera. Así pues, Monique y Evelyn inician este viaje juntas a través de los recuerdos de Evelyn y pasando por los siete matrimonios que marcaron su vida.Si pudiera describirle a alguien el libro lo haría diciendo que es como si Marilyn Monroe hubiera llegado a la vejez y decidiera contar todos los jugosos detalles de su vida en una biografía. Absolutamente todo. Con quién durmió, a quién engañó, con quién consiguió una buena amistad, los mejores y peores momentos, etc.Desde el inicio quedé atrapada con la historia de Evelyn en los 50s y mi interés nunca se perdió a lo largo de toda la historia. El estilo de escritura de la autora es simplemente maravilloso y no gasta tiempo en vueltas y vueltas antes de llegar a lo que quieres. Por el contrario, cada círculo que abría, lo cerraba de manera satisfactoria simplemente par abrir otro más y mantenerme enredada y deseosa de más. Me encariñé bastante con el personaje de Evelyn especialmente porque amé el detalle de hacerla un personaje gris. Ella se considera una mala persona, Monique la considera una buena persona, y creo que como lectora pude percibirla como perfectamente gris. Humana. Ese detalle me encantó, además de que todas sus relaciones y conexiones se sentían bastante reales y nunca encontré un momento en el que me hubiera fastidiado. Siempre quería más.Creo que si hubiera algo que quisiera criticarle a la novela es que tal vez el libro le vino a la autora inicialmente como el título y de ahí comenzó a desarrollar todo. ¿Por qué digo esto? Porque siento que hubieron algunos matrimonios de más en la historia que no me parecían necesarios y que se sentían como puro trámite para completar los siete esposos. Pero esto no hizo que disfrutara menos la novela. Para nada.Leí las últimas páginas de madrugada y créanme que me fui a dormir hecha un mar de llanto jajaLa verdad es que lo disfruté muchísimo. Es un libro muy sólido con una gran historia.¡Tienen que leerlo y decirme qué opinan!"

When you write the ending, Monique, make sure it’s clear that I don’t love this apartment, that I don’t care about all my money, that I couldn’t give a rat’s ass if people think I’m a legend, that the adoration of millions of people never warmed my bed.When you write the ending, Monique, tell everyone that it is the people I miss. Tell everyone that I got it wrong. That I chose the wrong things most of the time.When you write the ending, Monique, make sure the reader understands that all I was ever really looking for was family. Make sure it’s clear that I found it.


I'm sorry in advance if this review will come out more like a love-sick goodbye letter than an actual analysis of what the book was like but...Lord, this freaking book should come with a warning. Read responsibly and parsimoniously. Might cause death by heartbreak in a thousand different ways.The Song of Achilles is comedy compared to this book.I've never cried this much over a novel and I'm sure The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo will stay in my heart forever as one of those books I wish I could reread for the first time again and again. It was not just a book, but a transcendent experience and a very painful and emotional journey. Reid's writing is egregious, raw, it hits straight to the deepest corners of the soul (although her view of bi people is a bit blurred on the edges). Evelyn's character is iconic in its unrelatable-ness, realistically flawed, the grayest main character you'll ever find outside of a fantasy novel. I loved the setting the author created infinitely as I did the lgbt+ representation. I can see why people might argue bisexuals were shown once and again like they can't just keep it in their pants, but I read Evelyn's sleeping around purely as an Evelyn thing rather than it being tied to her sexuality, because it was clear she did what she did because she wanted to and not because she felt like she needed to because of some sort of internalized biphobia.  On the other hand, can we please stop with the bury your gays trope? 😭) The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of those novels that has the power of duality. It's a great work of fiction that tells a story to enjoy in your free time and at the same time it's a message that everybody should hear about. It's a book that makes you feel whole and shattered at the same time. It's a book that loves its reader but never expects the same courtesy. A love story that transcends time, space, paper and flesh. A real tour de force full of joy, friendship, success, guilt, forgiveness, grief, and most importantly, love in all its forms.

179,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75953902-sahil-javed,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is truly a well-crafted novel. It follows fictional It girl and actress, Evelyn Hugo, as she finally decides to share her story and the truth behind her many marriages. It blended a vivid character’s struggles and past effortlessly with the main storyline. It is honestly one of the best books I have ever read.

“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.”

 Evelyn Hugo was such a powerful character. The way the author developed her was seamless. She was such a polarising woman and I both liked and disliked her. The way in which her past was told was done cleverly and sophisticatedly and I honestly could not put this book down. Evelyn Hugo is not a perfect person. Hell, she’s not even a good person most of the time. But she was so realistic and the way she was portrayed was really accurate and made me feel so many things towards her: dislike, adoration, sympathy, frustration and most importantly, love. I adored Evelyn Hugo. I think she was a perfect example of how a woman can rise up against injustice and patriarchy and not let that define her journey. One thing I thought was really interesting was the parallel between what the world assumes about a certain celebrity and then the actual truth. When you read what people had to say about Evelyn and her seven husbands, it made her seem a certain way. But then watching her story unfold through her own perspective made me rethink every assumption I had about her from the way she was portrayed by how her society viewed her actions and decisions.

“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”

 I really liked the main narrator, Monique. I thought she was the perfect voice to contrast Evelyn’s and I really like the character development she went through in this book, especially when Evelyn’s life crossed into her own. That was done really well and I did not expect it at all. I think it was a great addition to the storyline and it really helped end the book in the perfect way. I also liked how diverse this book was and how it handled important topics such as divorce, sexuality, love and a woman’s claim to her own body. I think it was done in such a tactful and clever way, to the extent where it makes you feel so many things. I think the way sexuality was handled was done really, really well. There was a scene I really enjoyed between Monique and Evelyn where Evelyn states how she does not want to be labelled and put into a box. And as someone who hates labels and society’s need to define everything, it was a really dynamic scene which sent a really important message out. I felt a great deal of sympathy for Evelyn Hugo and the way things went about in her life. I cried a lot of times reading this book, especially towards the end but it was such an enjoyable experience. This book is now on my favourites list and I am definitely going to be rereading it sometime soon. 

“Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”

 The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a powerful book about a powerful character. It blended romance and sexuality with love and sacrifice and it did it so seamlessly and effortlessly. This is truly an amazing book."

I love this book.Original Review: June 2017This stunning, emotional, spitfire book is about old Hollywood teaching an unsuspecting innocent a thing or two about success in all its forms and doing whatever it takes to get it. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo features alternating timelines as an aging starlet (Evelyn Hugo) participates in a journalism interview of her life story. Lucky for us, her answers take on a life of their own, allowing readers to be sucked back in time to an era of glamour, strategy, and secrecy. Be aware that it's oh so easy to forget this is fiction. It feels like an actual memoir - the execution is flawless...and our fresh-faced journalist is not the only one learning life lessons here. Evelyn's character shares perspectives on equality issues, relationships, the spectrum of sexuality, the cost and consequences of success, and taking ownership of (and responsibility for) one's life. It's also about how times have changed, and although opportunities of significance are becoming more and more accessible to women these days, sometimes we are the ones who continue to stand in our own damned way. “So do yourself a favor and learn to grab life by the balls, dear. Don’t be so tied up in trying to do the right thing when the smart thing is so painfully clear.” It seems we all can learn something from Evelyn Hugo. Check it out!My favorite quote:“People think intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is “You're safe with me” - that's intimacy.”6/15/2017:Can't help myself. I'm reading it again before it goes back to the library <36/14/2017:OMG I adore this book. I knew early on it would be going on my favorite's list. Highly recommend.Full review to come..."

182,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129739820,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Evelyn Hugo, el ícono de Hollywood que se ha recluido en su edad madura, decide al fin contar la verdad sobre su vida llena de glamour y de escándalos. Pero cuando elige para ello a Monique Grant, una periodista desconocida, nadie se sorprende más que la misma Monique. ¿Por qué ella? ¿Por qué ahora? Monique no está precisamente en su mejor momento. Su marido la abandonó, y su vida profesional no avanza. Aun ignorando por qué Evelyn la ha elegido para escribir su biografía, Monique está decidida a aprovechar esa oportunidad para dar impulso a su carrera.Convocada al lujoso apartamento de Evelyn, Monique escucha fascinada mientras la actriz le cuenta su historia. Desde su llegada a Los Ángeles en los años 50 hasta su decisión de abandonar su carrera en el espectáculo en los 80 -y, desde luego, los siete maridos que tuvo en ese tiempo- Evelyn narra una historia de ambición implacable, amistad inesperada, y un gran amor prohibido. Monique empieza a sentir una conexión muy real con la actriz legendaria, pero cuando el relato de Evelyn se acerca a su fin, resulta evidente que su vida se cruza con la de Monique de un modo trágico e irreversible.""⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘(spoilers).cuanto tiempo sin hacer reseñas, espero no haber perdido la mano.Lamentablemente la escuela no me ha dejado leer un libro como se debe desde abril, leítan poquitos libros y fueron tan miserables que ni siquiera me acuerdo de la trama.también tengo más de 20 libros sin terminar gracias a un horrible bloqueo lector, enconclusión estoy para atrás con la lectura :(bueno ya basta de hablar de mi y empiezo con la reseña.Lo principal que tengo para decir es que esta es mi segunda lectura de este hermosolibro, cómo entra en la categoría de mis favoritos decidí leerlo otra vez para un trabajode la escuela estoy feliz de haberlo hecho.Hace mucho tiempo que quería hacerle una reseña más completa porque se lo merece,pero tenía miedo porque amo hacer reseñas donde hablo mierda de los libros, pero seme complica cuando tengo que hablar de un libro el cual ame.➳➳➳.empecemos. <3voy a empezar hablando de monique. ella es un personaje que medio igual desde elprincipio, aunque al principio si que no me la banqué por como trataba a evelyn,actuaba de una manera muy brusca. entiendo que estuviera nerviosa pero flaca bajale un toqueun poco a tu mala onda.después se convirtió en un personaje muy meh para mi, cuando hablaba de su vida meaburría, pero si ame el desarrollo de su personaje. pasó de ser una chica que pedía perdón hasta por existir a ser una mujer que le dijo a la mismísima Evelyn Hugo que laodiaba.tengo que decir que monique un terrible gay panic cuando vio a E, monique somostodos.ya desde el principio del libro te atrapa, creo que esto se debe a E. ya que desdepequeña sabía lo que quería y no le importaba que tenía que hacer para conseguirlo,siempre te quedas con las ganas de saber cuál va a hacer su siguiente jugada. es unamujer tan calculadora y paciente. como quisiera ser como ella, pero a mi me davergüenza hasta decirles que no a mis compañeros cuando me piden la tarea.de sus dos primeros matrimonios no tengo para decir mucho y tampoco se lo merecen.lo único que voy a decir es.... DON MORITE HIJO DE PUTA.ya quiero hablar de la relación de Evelyn y Celia, porque es de lo que más tengo parahablar.con el personaje de celia experimente el verdadero “amorodio” a veces llegaba a ser unamujer de lo más insoportable y caprichosa.era una egoísta del orto que solo pensaba en sí misma, con complejo de gabriela de HighSchool Musical. siempre quería pegarle pero quería que este con E, porque ella la quería :(pero también llegue a entenderla, ella es humana y tal vez yo también hubiera tenido susmismas actitudes si estuviera en su situación. nunca voy a bancarme a la celiajoven que se creía el centro del universo, si me gusto la celia de 49 años para arriba, eracalculadora y cautelosa, era casi iguala evelyn.tengo que decir que al principio de su relación no estaban preparadas para estar juntas. tiraron mucho tiempo elcual podrían haber aprovechado para estar juntas. una quería dejarlo todo por la otra y laotra no estaba preparada para dejar ir lo que con tanto esfuerzo había logrado.estuvo super mal que C le exigiera a E que dejara todo cuando no le correspondía. E trabajo mucho para llegar a donde estaba y que C le pidiera eso demostró lo egoísta queera. Entiendo que C estaba cansada de ocultarse y fingir ser buenas amigas, pero no lecorrespondía. E no es egoísta por no querer tirar todo su trabajo a la basura, C es laverdadera cucaracha.odie y ame esta relación desde el inicio hasta al final. cuando C le pregunto a E si estabamal que la quisiera de verdad me rompí.cuando E tuvo que estar con ese pelotudo que era cantante que ni vale nombrarlo la pasetan mal, E la paso tan mal todo por proteger a C. y qué hizo ella? juzgo a E y le dijo ""puta"".entiendo que se sintió traicionada, debe ser horrible enterarse que tu pareja se acostó conotra persona y además quedó embarazada. En esta parte de su relación faltó comunicación,si tal vez E le hubiera explicado a C su plan o aclararlo desde un principio tal vez no sehubieran separado.de todas maneras es difícil ponerse en el lugar de ambas. Mientras leía me sentí unhijo con padres divorciados, por una parte quiero defender a Evelyn a las trompadas y porotro me quiero tomar un vino con celia mientras lloramos y cantamos juntas “traitor” deOlivia Rodrigo.Me encanta opinar sobre las relaciones en los libros, como si fuera una experta enrelaciones, cuando la única relación que tuve fue con mi gato. así que como experta sin experiencia les digo que si hubiera habido mejor comunicación no se hubieran separadocinco años.cuando me refiero que detesto a la C joven es que nunca cambia, siempre pensaba en símisma y hacía sentir mala E siempre. llegó a decirle que solo “era un buen par de tetas”solo porque no la acompañó. pero claro lo justificó diciendo que estaba borracha y se hizo lavíctima.El cuarteto siempre me encantó, era un equipo genial, los cuatro criaban a Connor. perollegó don y su película chota y arruino todo :( aunque la relación de E y C otra vez nofuncionó por la falta de comunicación.John era un personaje secundario básico pero igual me dolió.rex me callo super bien, era super buena onda y su matrimonio fue genial :DLuego vino la decepción viviente, el señor Max Girard. Este matrimonio si fue super forzado,no me creo que Evelyn se enamoró de la noche para la mañana, pero saben que fue aúnmás forzado? el cambio drástico en la personalidad de Max, siento que lo hicieron para que la vuelta forzada de la relación con C.ellos se conocían hace años, que raro se casaron y salió su “verdadera personalidad”. Ellaestaba muy emocionada por Max y él tenía potencial para ser un buen marido, pero lo desaprovecharon.yo: diciendo que la vuelta de E y C fue forzada.también yo: me emociono porque C mencionó de manera indirecta a E.luego de todo esto llegó toda la parte fea, ya sabía lo que iba a pasar pero igual fue comoun balde de agua fría, siempre conmociona porque es algo inesperado.Harry me vas a doler toda la vida, eras mi personaje favorito, merecias mas :(Evelyn no se casó siete veces, ella se casó ocho veces. es tan triste que nunca pudieronmostrarse , hasta que claro, ambas murieron:(Este libro siempre me da melancolía, a los personajes los vi desde sus inicios y los vi morir.ya al final del libro superan los sesenta años, pero en mi mente seguían siendo jóvenes ymerecían más.C era insoportable pero dolió. Me dolió ver a E sufrir otra vez.C murio y lo unico que penso E fue “no tuvimos suficiente tiempo” la entiendo tanto porque sientoque los años se me pasan volando y no puedo pararlos.tantas cosas que pude haber hecho o haber disfrutado, pero ya no puedo recuperar. Megustaría volver al pasado, aprovechar mejor el tiempo y no arrepentirme ahora.volviendo a la historia quiero hablar de rupert él también fue como john, un personaje básicoque solo completaba el cuadrado de evelyn, celia y harry. pero estoy agradecida con él porquedarse siempre con E y nunca dejarla, hasta que murió.la vida de E fue triste luego de todo, se quedó sin ninguno de sus seres queridos, ella los viomorir a todos.lo del padre de monique fue horrible, pero siento que todos haríamos eso en esa situación.pero me siento mal por monique, deba haber sido horrible enterarse eso después de años.también pobre su madre creía que su esposo era su mitad, cuando él tenía otra mitad.⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘Me costó bastante hacer esta reseña, tardé varias horas en hacerla y poder combinar misnotas, pero se logró. me siento feliz que este libro tenga su reseña.Si bien en mi reseña solo señalo lo que no me gusta es porque mis reseñas se basan eneso. pero el resto del libro lo amo, me atrapó otra vez y sigo flechada por la señora Hugo.un libro de lo más recomendado.esperamos que pueda salir de mi bloqueo.gia. 🦋(ಠ_ಠ)━☆ﾟ.*･｡ﾟ"

💃My Thoughts💃
I don't even know where to begin. For starters, I was struggling trying to decide if I should give it 4 or 5 stars. For me personally I'm going to give it 4 stars. I enjoyed the book very much but a part of me didn't like the way it ended. So many emotions, crying, laughing, frustration. It's such an emotional roller coaster. I came into this book with an open mind, besides accidentally reading into things a little too much. It started off a little slow for me but, once you get to the first two husbands it starts to pick up. I could not put this book down. It was so freaking good. Omg! I literally guessed right that the two main characters are connected. I remember reading about the 6th husband and something occurred to me that they are connected because why would she just demand to work with her and no one else?
💃Main Characters💃
☆Evelyn☆This woman lived a wild life. I see what she meant by how she doesn't want people to think she thinks of herself as better than anyone. She openly admits to all her wrongs. Did she do some crazy things that she shouldn't have?? Yes. But, these things helped her to realize how much she has accomplished and what life lessons to pass on in her biography. But I loved her character and she was so fun to read about ☆The Husbands☆There are 7 husbands (as the title says) and they are all very different. There were some where my heart went out to them and some where I just didn't care because they were either twisted or crazy. Favorite ones ❤❤❤•Harry Cameron•Robert JamisonAlright ones 🙁•Ernie Diaz•Rex NorthAbsolutely not ones 😡•Don Adler•Mick Riva•Max Girad1st husband- Ernie DiazHe was kind of boring ngl. She literally used him to become an actress and to get away from her abusive father. He made her realize how men really looked at her and she dropped him like that. 🤨2nd husband- Don AdlerOkay so before I read all that craziness I loved Don. He was absolutely perfect for her. Evelyn at the time said how amazing he made her feel and how she had truly fallen in love. Well you will be in awe for a little bit till the end of the chapter. It was such a slap in the face. He hits her. Ummm... what happened to sweet Don because this sounds like some random stranger. 🧐 I completely lost all respect for him after I read this. But, unfortunately in this situation people are either too afraid to leave or they say how much they love them and don't want to leave. Well for me personally, we are done!!! Period that's the end of that. *mic drop*3rd husband- Mick RivaFor this guy there aren't really many words to say. It was literally and I mean literally a one night thing (got married and everything). That's all her because there's no way I could do that. Then on top of that he insulted her saying how he wasn't as impressed with her the next morning. Umm... dude get the heck out. Boy bye! 4th husband- Rex NorthRex wasn't bad. I say he's alright because they didn't have a spark. But, he's a sweet guy. I didn't feel emotionally attached to him like the others. I am glad that he found his true love. They were adorable. ❤5th husband- Harry CameronNow where to begin. Harry was my absolute favorite. He was so dedicated to loving her and keeping her and their daughter safe. I wish their love was real. I do feel like it could have blossomed into something amazing. He did reveal that he likes men. And as much as I liked him and Evelyn, I fully support his decision. The first guy he was with was so sweet. I hated when he died. And the second was so considerate but, they are also what tied Monique and Evelyn together. So, *not me tearing up a little*  😥 all I'm going to say for Harry's ending in this book is that he always has a special place in my heart. 6th husband- Max GiradThis dude was all kinds of trouble. He says how he has loved Evelyn from the day he met her. *side eye* Dude stop lying!!! They go out for burgers and he asks her to divorce Harry. Now HOLD UP!!! 🤚 First of all you just finally started getting acquainted with each other and now you want her to get rid of Harry. Oh nope! He would have been dropped so fast his head would have been spinning. And that's that!7th husband- Robert JamisonFinal one and bless his soul. For those of you who know, who he is *wink wink* I have to say he is up there right after Harry. He is so kind and compassionate. He cares for Evelyn's daughter like his own. I will say there wasn't any spark or anything. But, the way he treated her and Harry's daughter was so sweet. He also will always have a special place in my heart after Harry ofc. 🤭Monique GrantI love Monique. She was so open to helping Evelyn and helping her tell her story besides Evelyn telling her a shocking thing about her father. In the end, Evelyn really did help her make some changes with her life and she finally started to understand herself more.*Spoiler* (if ykyk/ *wink wink*)Now I am not going to reveal the major spoiler of the book because I feel like it would take away from the suspense of others reading the book. However I will say that *spoiler* really changed Evelyn for the better and I think it worked out nicely for her. Like I said before if you know you 🤭❤

This is definitely one to reread. It’s so amazing and emotional. I don’t think I have ever read one like this and I can’t wait to read more. 💗💖💞"
184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/140686938-dani,Rating 5 out of 5,"5/5 ★'s How do you even begin to process this book?! I feel...emotional and exhausted in the best way. I feel I've experienced all of the loss that is encountered in this tale. It took many turns that I did not expect going into the story. It is a tale of love and of all the many forms love comes in through life. I think this is one of those books where you just go in blind and listen to Evelyn's story (especially if you audiobook it as I did, it was truly magnificent!). I didn't know what to expect — as this is my first TJR book, but it blew me away. Our journalist Monique has quite the story as well. I loved both of the leading women in this book. There are big take away's that may stick with you for a while after reading. I recommend this for when you aren't sure what genre to read...just read Evelyn's story. ♡"
185,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell,Rating 3 out of 5,"I don't have strong feelings about this book. It had its interesting moments, and it was an enjoyable enough read. But I found the ending to be gimmicky, sort of like the ending of  Daisy Jones and the Six, but at least with that one the book as a whole was more up my alley and had a unique format. I personally didn't connect with the characters in this one so much as I was curious to read about them. Monique's storyline felt underdeveloped, but TJR had to sneak in those chapters for the ending to make sense. Overall, not bad but not up to the hype for me. "

188,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788446-hannah,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was as lovely and heartbreaking as nearly everybody says. Absolutely worth reading.I feel like I was the last person on earth who hadn’t read this book and I am so glad I finally did. That said, it took me a while to finish this because there was a bit in the middle that dragged for me – however, man, does Taylor Jenkins Reid ever pull it back together after the 50% mark. From that point onwards, I was so very invested.On the surface, this is the story of Evelyn Hugo’s seven marriages as told to Monique, a rather inexperienced journalist getting the chance of her lifetime to write a memoir to one of Hollywood’s greatest stars. But more than that, this book is the portrait of woman who honestly and gracefully bares her all to the world here. And I adored Evelyn so very much. She is by far my favourite part of this book; she is ruthless and ambitious but unflinchingly honest in her own portrayal. I could not help but root for her as she made her way in the minefield that is Hollywood. Whenever the storyline strayed from her, I was eager to get back to her and get to know her better. Monique on the other hand did not always work for me as the person through whose lens we are getting the story.Told in effortless prose that compelled me to keep reading, Taylor Jenkins Reid tells her story without unnecessary flourish in a way that let her main character shine and her side characters dazzle. I adored Harry beyond measure and thought Celia was wonderfully flawed but incredibly compelling. The ending ripped my heart out but I am so glad to have finally read this.You can find this review and other thoughts on books on my blog.I received a drc courtesy of NetGalley and Simon and Schuster UK in exchange for an honest review."
189,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49071166-hrissie-1st-week-on-campus-somewhat-run-down,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 luminous stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐!
A bold and spectacular work of fiction - honest to the point of excruciating brutality - that leaves nothing unsaid, and says what we wouldn't have otherwise known needed telling. In the name of what we value in literature, it must be said in turn that this book needed writing, therefore literature needed Taylor Jenkins Reid's storytelling.
🌹🌹🌹With Evelyn Hugo, Taylor Jenkins Reid delves into and unveils human complexities that challenge and surpass the very notion of bestseller. By means of a protagonist – Evelyn – so wholly developed and elected as the representative of truth within the novel, the author constructs a story-within-a-story of Evelyn's unfolding biography as it is related first-hand to the chosen editor and writer, Monique Grant, whose own story is scattered in snippets in those brief pauses in Evelyn's narrative. Its ambiguous moral significance – or lack thereof – lies in the multifaceted sense of self and prevailing dignity by way of which Evelyn ""wants to be seen exactly as she truly is, with all the nuance and shades of grey"": the precise and gruesome detailing of her rise to glory, her daring and vaulting ambition in demanding that she embodies the number one 60s 'It Girl' at all costs, the objectionable compromises made at the detriment of one's self for her to be able maintain the image of a movie star par excellence desired and admired by all, and also safeguard parts of her self that would otherwise demolish what she worked for so indefatigably: Fame as an escape from Hell's Kitchen.Much like Evelyn Hugo, Jenkins Reid is a master at work who will stop at nothing to reveal truths, who knows enough of the meaning of the word to recognise that there is only one thing for it: one must dare to plunge into a bottomless pit of universal darkness and quintessential ugliness in order for some real illuminating light to seep through. In literature, grasping at the Truth owes much to structural coherence and orchestration, and TJR leaves nothing to be desired on this account. The Truth, semi-truths, ironic truths, undeliberate truths, untruths, outright lies, make up the fabric of Hollywood (""both a place and a feeling"") as the epitome of a tension-ridden and potentially life-shattering juxtaposition between what is real and its triumphing counterpart: appearances, or the idea of what is real. Much of Evelyn's endeavours, struggles and tight spots are resolved with willful dissemination of media-friendly content:""I'm not saying the gossip columnists printed what they knew to be a lie. I'm simply saying they were all too happy to believe the lie I was selling them. And of course, that's the easiest lie to tell, one you know the other person desperately wants to be true.""Indeed, that which allows Hollywood to be acquires a level of Reality in its own right, and the starkness of contrasts between antithetical versions of the Real are manifested more strikingly by means of the scattered excerpts from newspapers like ‘Sub Rosa’, ‘Hollywood Digest’, ‘Photomoment’ and ‘Now This’, that tell of dynamite, sexpot Evelyn and revise her public identity from one article to the other. There lingers the explicit realisation that Evelyn is a product of the culture she subscribes to, and yet she appropriates it to the point of manipulating its mechanisms to her own advantage, not unlike other emerging young actresses. With her precocious understanding of the ways of the world, her experience of the chilling precariousness of fame and the animalistic ferocity in Hollywood's treatment of humanity, she is a step ahead of all others - or one could say that parallel to her ambitions, she finds herself forced to be tragically so, the writer of her own tragedy. There is also the fact that Hollywood is the loneliest of excessively-peopled worlds, with a tricky-to-identify layered patterning of people playing one other and manoeuvring their own success. The body constitutes a central thematic concern, as a measure for the exertion of power and dominance but also as a deliberately exploited means to an end. And yet, the self is left adrift, and when the doors close on this exquisitely rewarding yet incomparably cruel world, themes of sexuality (bi/homo), intimacy and the reality of relationships acquire a resounding weight that threatens to disintegrate even the strong-hearted like Evelyn. One cannot help but sense that the title of the novel acts analogously to the protagonist's misleading dissemination of gossip. Multiple times throughout her narrative, Evelyn lucidly attests to the right of preserving her own self beyond her seven marriages: she is Evelyn Hugo and not one of her husbands has an actual say in that. Though portions of the narrative are assigned to the representation of her husbands according to her adjectival classification of them (of which ""Goddamn Don Adler"", ""Clever Rex North"", ""Brilliant, kind-hearted, tortured Harry Cameron"", ""Disappointing Max Girard""), there is an overarching spirit that transcends this systematic and pragmatic organisation of her story. Symptomatically, there is no such classification for Celia St. James, for she is in each and all, on every page and the very reason behind the greater part of her marriages. The climactic ending frames and partially resolves the narrative; it provides answers to the meaning behind the choice of Monique Grant for the role of writing Evelyn's biography, yet preserves the powerful echoes of the story beyond the written page, the secret struggles and surfacing of love and intimacy in all shapes, forms and manifestations, notwithstanding the inexorability of the World.🌹🌹🌹And thus, between impressively articulate plots and subplots, Taylor Jenkins Reid erects a world that needed erecting, affords a written display to emotions and experiences that demanded exposure, defies standards of storytelling that needed defying. She has authored an astonishing masterpiece that is alternately beautiful and heart-breaking, controversial and relatable, raw and repulsive, glamorous and dismal, riveting and ruthless, harrowingly haunting and human, tragic and tantalisingly real, provocative and legendary. Amidst her pages arises a plethora of intertwined emotions infused with boundless grit; with intransigence and compassion alike. Her writing gives an imposing voice to the devastating loss of self and jeopardised intimacy as inevitable collateral damage of intrigue, social norms, and the philosophy of ‘fair trade’, humouring and honouring the ambivalences inherent in human nature.❤️"

“Seven husbands. Which one did she love best? Which one was the real one?”
I’m a huge fan of Taylor Jenkins Reid books and in this novel she presents the life story of an Hollywood icon who seems to have randomly picked our heroine to write this priceless piece. The story is not what I expected yet was executed and delivered expertly and left me in awe of Miss Reid’s talent. 
“I will tell you my life story in a way that will be beneficial to both us. Although, to be honest, mainly you.”
The now aged icon starts at the beginning of her life and leads a reader and our writer, Monique through the story of her scandalous life. Evelyn is a beauty being the envy of men and woman alike. She light up the stage, her sex appeal, her talent, her strength, and let’s not forget seven failed marriages.“I’ve spent a very long time learning how to spin the truth. It’s hard to undo that wiring.” Evelyn does harbor a secret that she has kept out of the papers and in which makes this story a bit scandalous yet in the end beautiful. I devoured the story, I loved how the author even tied in Monique to the plot and in the end the last line will stay with me for a very long time!!! "

I loved this book! Having read Daisy Jones first, I wasn't sure if this would measure up...oh it did!I think the thing I loved the most about this book, was not even the fantastic story, but how TJR manages to transport you back in time. She has a gift that she can make a character so realistic, that you actually believe they are real. I love that! I will be the first to admit that I did indeed google Daisy Jones...just because I had to make sure. With Evelyn, I already knew she was TJR's creation. If I did not know this, I would have been tempted to google her also.Unfortunately I went into this one knowing a bit about the theme of it. I wished I could have been floored, because I know I would have been. However I did manage to be suprised still by many things. Overall I kept asking myself...why on earth did Evelyn pick Monique? Was it the past articles she has worked on? I couldn't put my finger on it.Evelyn made her empire. She created herself, she did every single thing she could to get to the top. She landed herself in LA in the 1950's and quickly became a sexy, movie star that knew no boundaries. She did WHATEVER and I mean whatever it took to achieve the fame she desired. Good for you Evelyn! However famous Evelyn was, we still see that fame does come with a price. That you trade things in life for your time in the spotlight. I can say no more, because if you have not read it, you need to. Avoid reading in depth reviews because this is one you want to go in as blind as possible.I truly love this author's writing style. She manages to squeeze a tear out of me with every single book. In fact she is guilty of causing me to ugly cry on past occasions. I love when a book can move me that much. TJR you did it again!"

Needless to say, I was completely blown away with the direction the story took and I loved it!✅ EVELYN HUGO was an iconic characters that will never be forgotten. I loved getting an inside view into her mind. She was surprisingly very calculating and knew exactly what she had to do to get to where she wanted to be. She never looked back in shame on her actions, no matter how questionable. Honestly, I respected her choices and I wish I had the confidence to just go for what I want the way she did, with such a blatant disregard for the typical rules of society

""If the definition of enjoying sex means that it was pleasurable, then I've had a lot of sex that I didn't enjoy. But if we're defining it as being happy to have made the trade, then, well, I haven't had much I hated.""

✅ HARRY CAMERON was such an absolute sweetheart 🥰🥺 Harry and Evelyn’s relationship was just so adorable and I’m happy they both had each other to rely on throughout their lives. Everyone deserves a best friend like this ✅ THIS BOOK COVERED SO MANY TOPICS in a very tasteful way. It covered greed, fame, cultural identity, the history of the LGBTQ+ movement, feminism, abuse - and all of it was done so brilliantly and was very believable. I had no idea this book was so heavy on the LGBTQ rep but I love how all different types of sexuality were included in here✅ THE HOLLYWOOD DRAMA was actually very entertaining to me. I really enjoyed all of the random conflicts Evelyn was thrown into and how she always managed to scheme her way back into the spotlight... oftentimes through some creative marriages 😅 Makes you wonder how much of the real Hollywood is just smoke and mirrors tooOverall, I am really happy I finally got to read this book! I've had it on hold at my library for close to a year now and it was definitely worth the wait. While I think it was incredibly well written and that the characters were amazing, there was something about the last quarter of the book that felt a little anticlimactic. But I definitely still recommend it to everyone!"

Not one of those pages were boring! Taylor Jenkins Reid does a fantastic job creating and bringing together realistic, rich, diverse and well-developed characters to life that we all quickly loved and adored. Even some of the not well-loved characters brought some kind of lesson, insight, and wisdom into the story through all of the topics and situations that incurred throughout Evelyn’s life. Taylor Jenkins Reid uniquely leads us through Evelyn’s life as she relays her life story to writer Monique which is told to us in husband sections. Through Evelyn’s telling we learn about Evelyn’s life that she shared with her seven husbands and we could see and feel her struggles, and how calculated yet graceful she was to keep herself in the limelight. We admired her determination and strength. Taylor Jenkins Reid does a great job weaving in so many different scenarios and topics within the storyline. We loved how we could see how vulnerable she was and how she refused to let that stop her to get what she wanted. We all really enjoyed all the stories and each section of the husbands and their title and found them fitting to each husband. It was a very clever and unique way to introduce us to each husband. The husband and story we all loved the most of Evelyn’s was Brilliant, Kind-hearted, Tortured Harry Cameron. Their relationship sparked the most emotion in us and we really enjoyed their very special relationship. Taylor Jenkins Reid does such an excellent job with each of the husbands stories and we could really see how much Evelyn grows and learns something about herself through each of her husband's and the relationship she had with them.We all really enjoyed the tabloid articles that were weaved into the story adding a sensational feel to this story for us. Taylor Jenkins Reid does a brilliant job of making Evelyn so real by deriving insight from her, giving her many words of wisdom. Throughout our discussion, we really enjoyed sharing her words of wisdom that we thought highlighted her story even more as we were reading. We really enjoyed her insight and wisdom that she brought to her own story. So we can’t leave this review without sharing one. “The world doesn’t give things, you take things.”The ending left a few of us teary-eyed and caught us all off guard as we never saw it coming. At times it felt a little over the top but it really worked for us and in the end, it left us wondering how many relationships, similar scenarios, and cover-ups really do happen in Hollywood. It had us thinking and picturing different actresses and discussing who we felt was similar to Evelyn and who she reminded of us and would go to the lengths that Evelyn did to stay in the limelight.All of our Traveling Sisters Group Read Reviews can be found on Norma’s and my sister blog:http://www.twogirlslostinacouleereadi..."
195,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem,Rating 3 out of 5,"Goodreads Choice award for best Historical Fiction of 2017 An entertaining read of old Hollywood intrigue, sex and glamour. A soap opera gossipy style story with a few twists and turns to keep the reader interested and turning the pages. The book tells the story of a fictional star called Evelyn Hugo who coming towards the end of her eventful life decides to give her final interview to Monique Grant and unknown Journalist. I liked the book and the character of Evelyn whose life was scandalous and full of drama like many of the great names of Hollywoods past. Its a page turner albeit a little predictable in places but overall well written and easy to read. I might have rated it a little higher but felt it dragged towards the middle and became a little bit repetitive but with seven marriages that was to be expected.I listened to this one on audio and the narration was quite well done."

Ich fühle mich vollkommen und gleichzeitig dennoch so leer und fragte mich ununterbrochen, wie Taylor Jenkins Reid eine Geschichte verfassen konnte, die einfach alles beinhaltet, was ich liebe? Wie kann es sein, dass es Bücher gibt, bei denen es einem so vorkommt, als sein sie nur für dich geschrieben? Bücher, durch die du nur so durchfliegst und die am Ende einen versteckten Dolch zücken, der sich tief in dein Herz rammt. Bücher, bei denen jedes einzelne Wort an der richtigen Stelle sitzt und dessen setzte nicht hätten besser gewählt werden können? Bücher, die rundum einfach nur PERFEKT sind?""Die sieben Männer der Evelyn Hugo"" ist genau so ein Gesamtkunstwerk, wie ich es selten bisher zuvor gelesen habe. Aber ich bin umso glücklicher, dass ich diese Geschichte lesen und verinnerlichen durfte. Für mich ab jetzt eines meiner absoluten Lieblingsbücher, bei dem ich weiß, dass ich noch oft an Evelyn & Monique zurückdenken werde! 🤍 "

Started with a good premise, but by the end had devolved into persuasive essays on modern political hot-button topics. There were a lot of unbelievable scenarios (some of the marriages seemed forced to provide a theme of ""lots of marriages,"" the events of the twist didn't really make sense, an 80-year-old using all contemporary and politically correct phrasing). Also, too much descriptive sex. She has nice breasts, we get it."

Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.""I'm just gonna go and cry in peace. Those last 50? 100? pages broke me. I loved this book so much. I picked it on a whim since I saw the audiobook was available on Scribd and I did not regret that decision. This was a really hyped up book in 2018 (yes, I know I'm 2 years late, wait no, actually 3 years!), but you know the saying, better late than never. Trigger warnings: death, biphobia, homophobia, domestic abuse Monique is really astonished when she is picked by Evelyn Hugo to write her biography. Monique is unknown magazine reporter, no one in journalism so why would Evelyn Hugo choose her to tell her life story? Monique listens to Evelyn as she unfurls her life story - from how she made her way to Los Angelas in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the 1980s, revealing all the truth about her life. Along the way Monique realises that Evelyn's life interstects with her's more than she actually thought in a extremely tragic way. This book was just amazing. It was not a perfect book by any means, but it was just so good. There were so many times when I simply wanted to go on google and search more about Evelyn Hugo since she actually felt like a real celebrity. There were so many times when my brain actually thought Evelyn was a real person and she actually existed. What the hell, how did the author actually manage to do that?! How did Taylor Jenkins Reed made me think Evelyn Hugo was real?! I listen to the audiobook and that was one of the best decisions I made it. It was excellent. I was hooked from the beginning and everytime I was just like one more chapter, just oen more chapter. I ended up wanting to do more homework just so I could listen to the audiobook. I was so engaged and I just couldn't put it down. I ended up just staying in bed and doing nothing else while I listen to the last 2 hours. That something that never happens. I always have to do something while listening to the audibook. I couldn't even change the speed to this audiobook, if I did it felt like I was ruining the experience. The narrator was excellent. I highly recommend listening to the audiobook. It's one of the best audiobooks I have ever listened to. Evelyn Hugo was such an interesting character to read about. She never claims through out the book to be a good person or a saint or anything like that. From the beginning she knows who she is and she knows that she would do anything to get what she wants. I loved seeing her life journey and I absolutely loved seeing what was the deal with those seven husbands. I probably won't remember the name of most of her husbands, but they don't matter. Evelyn was what matter and how she dealt with all those relationships. I loved the other characters in this story too. I didn't really care about Monique that much to be honest. She was interesting and I was very interested in why Evelyn chose her to write her biography, but Monique's storyline wasn't by any means as interesting as Evelyn. And it's not really supposed to be, the interesting thing is actually hwo their lives connect. Celia wasn't really my favorite character. There were times when I really loved her and then where times when I wanted to slap her. I really liked Harry's character though, he was one of my favorite. I don't know for some reason I really liked him. This was an amazing story. I had such a great time listening to Evelyn Hugo's life story and I really need to get a physical copy since thsi was everything I really wanna get to re-read it in the future. If you're one of those people, who like me, are 3 years late and haven't read this book yet. I recommend pick it up. I especially recommend reading it via audibook!"

It was a lovely book , not necessarily too deep but trust me when I say it wasn't light either . It may look sultry but theres more to it . I absolutely loved how evelyn was portrayed the good and the ugly , the unflinching truth and boy was there a lot of ugly that wasn't justified , I LOVED HER FOR IT . Now she wants to be seen ,no filters attached .The different marriages and love types in the books were interesting to see and hey you got your LGBTQ+ characters for those looking. She was such a different sort of character -and not the only complex one - and that really drew me .Not only that, it made me really think about these things and I found myself constantly making comparisons . It was DIFFERENT , not something I would usually read but Im sure glad i did .so take it up y'all ! and smash the patriarchy ;)ps:( iykyk) there were constant quotes of ""you're too much"" and so I dedicate this one to ojos . 😉EDIT: I LOVE HARRY YALL, such a great character"

204,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111513919-gabriel,Rating 4 out of 5,"Una novela a la altura de lo que promete y más; con una protagonista que se lleva todo por delante.Monique, una periodista medianamente desconocida se lleva la gran oportunidad de entrevistar a Evelyn Hugo, una de los grandes íconos de Hollywood, lo que no sabe ella es que tendrá en su poder toda la historia de esta mujer. En sus manos quedará el peso de cada una de las cosas que tuvo que hacer Evelyn para poder llegar hasta dónde está hoy en día, qué costo tuvo que pagar por ello, a quién perdió en el camino, lo que ganó en recompensa, a quién amó en realidad de los siete maridos que tuvo o si hubo alguien más. En fin, te muestra tantas facetas de su vida desde los años 50 hasta prácticamente la actualidad; los rastros que quedan de ella en el presente.Primero lo primero, está claro que estamos ante un libro superventas que como mínimo lo que tiene que cumplir con el lector es engancharlo, entretenerlo y que no quiera dejar de leer hasta que llegue a la última página. Y la verdad es que este libro cumple con lo que promete de principio a fin. Aunque al comienzo no me convencía porque sentí que los inicios de Evelyn se relatan de manera apresurada es sin duda de esos libros que van in crescendo, todo va tornándose más complicado y adictivo en la medida que avanzas. Y es que para empezar, lo más resaltable en la lectura es Evelyn Hugo; una mujer que hará todo lo posible por trazar su camino al estrellato y ser todo lo que ha deseado en su vida por su propio esfuerzo y sacrificio. Sin embargo, eso mismo la convierte en una protagonista que no a todo el mundo le caerá inmediatamente bien, ya que el mismo peso de querer lograr llegar a su meta solo la hará actuar con mucha inteligencia y frialdad; manipulando y utilizando a los que la rodean. En definitiva, es todo un personaje gris (de los que me gustan). Y no es solo ella, los otros secundarios no están libres de pecado, cada uno carga con algo que los vuelve humanos al errar y herir contínuamente a los que más quieren.El título del libro y de los capítulos dedicados a sus siete maridos solo son una excusa para contar la historia de una mujer en la industria cinemátografica. Los maridos de Evelyn son lo de menos, es ella la que importa, quien de verdad lo vale. Y por eso, sus últimas conversaciones con Monique son de mucha importancia al querer dejar en claro muchas de las cosas por las que pasó; es casi una obligación moral a la que se ve empujada para hacer transparente cada recoveco de su vida cruelmente planeado y ejecutado con minuciosidad por ella y por los medios de comunicación.Es una historia que visibiliza, representa e incluye a gran parte de la comunidad LGBT, de verdad que quedé impresionado de lo bien que la autora les dió relevancia. Los prejuicios, los miedos, la ignorancia, la segregación, el desconocimiento, hay mucho de eso en sus historias. De hecho, incluso hay una crítica al cómo los bisexuales tienden a ser invalidados e incluso invisibilizados no solo por la sociedad sino también por parte de miembros de la misma comunidad.A su misma vez ejemplifica como una mujer se mueve en el mismo medio, llegando al punto de ser denigrada, ultrajada y cosificada por productores, directores, actores y cualquier persona del entorno. Hay misoginia y machismo, eso se respira en las páginas con obviedad. Y es que la mujer siempre lleva las de perder, aunque Evelyn es de las que saca las garras y como sea logra defender su figura. Impresionante como un personaje puede ser tan admirable y a su misma vez tan humano equivocándose todo el tiempo.También, es claro que muestra como la vida de los famosos es una constante persecución y rumores sobre cualquier dato, hecho o encuentro confirmado. Hay una deshumanización e idealización con ellos terriblemente peligrosa y a su misma vez son la comidilla de los medios de comunicación constantemente al ser una figura pública. Y por si fuera poco hacia el final plantea si una vida arreglada, llena de lujos y donde el foco está encima de ti todo el tiempo vale realmente la pena. Es más, se llega a dejar en el aire si a eso se le puede considerar vida alguna al estar rodeada de rumores, falsedades, incluso hasta ser una vida actuada por ella misma, quien es toda una maestra en la profesión. Que con todo y eso también hace gala de una muestra de las uniones que entablan los perosonajes con los demás; la amistad, el amor filial, el amor romántico y el amor propio. Recorre muchos pasajes en tan poco.Ya para finalizar como solo quería hablar de lo bueno, es por eso que como un último apunte en contraposición a todo lo que resalto de la lectura debo decir lo que para mí es su punto flojo. Personalmente, me ha parecido un libro guionizado (sin yo saber mucho del tema) ¿por qué lo digo? Pues porque sentí que algunos de los temas polémicos y terribles fueron tocados medio por encima. Además de que a veces entre los capítulos todo se resolvía de una manera tan rápida, con solo dos o tres frases quitándole la fuerza al escrito en ocasiones.Y creo que a eso se reduce: en que nuestra narradora, Evelyn, tenía en su peso el solo contar y contar hecho tras hecho en vez de mostrar (cosa que en la narrativa muchas veces resulta más efectivo); porque si solo haces el acto de contar vas a conseguir que el escrito se sienta simple, frío y distante, dejando que la relación del lector con el libro sea indiferente. Es más, me puse a investigar y la escritora es guionista, así que no dudo en que ella también ha escrito la mayoría de sus libros pensando en que un día estos sean adaptados a la gran pantalla. Así que ahí encontré mi confirmación e incluso me atrevo a apostar de que sería mucho mejor de lo que es la novela. Pero por el momento hay que contentarnos con el libro, que es una buena apuesta y está más que recomendadísimo. Lo tiene todo para convencer al público general, aunque siempre existirán opiniones encontradas (como con todo best seller) para mí ha valido gratamente la pena."

I'll just start by saying this: I'm bisexual and have dealt with a lot of hate from a lot of people. Most times there are comments like ""I have girl crushes too, but it doesn't mean I'm in love with them"" or ""it's just a phase, it will disappear soon.""But this book broke my heart into pieces. For a long period of time, women have been sexualized, abused, and mistreated. it's happened in the media, it's happened in representation in the film industry, and it's happened in the music industry and Hollywood. And this book truly showed how a single woman's live can be ruined because of a mans action.Evelyn Hugo may just happen to be my icon. She was headstrong, stubborn, and clever. She knew her worth and her confidence and that made me truly love her. The writing was just beautiful. There may be readers who hate Evelyn for what she's done, most who will probably be men.But this book didn't refuse her wickedness. She paid for her actions. But so many others have done the same, most being men, and hollywood's ignored them. Evelyn was mistreated and used jsut because of a pretty face and big butt. She knew how she would be looked the minute she walked into the film industry. All she did was try to accept it. She really did remind me of Marilyn Monroe. The only difference is that one is fictional and the other is sadly true. Thank you Reid, for this beautiful godswritten book"

Ya que cuando leía el libro me lo estaba imaginando todo como una película así que no puedo estar más 🤧✨😻😭Genero: novela, ficción, novela rosaAutor: Taylor Jenkins ReidPáginas: 380Puntuación: +5/5 ⭐️🎭 la ambientación es contemporánea pero basada en el mundo extravagante vida en Hollywood, años 50-60. Te logra sumergir dentro de la historia de una manera impresionante. Se muestra la manera en la que funcionaba y funciona el mundo del cine, cómo y qué son capaces de hacer actores y actrices, directores y los medios de comunicación para llegar a ser reconocidos.🎥 trata temas muy sensibles y muy fuertes. Tw: aborto, violencia doméstica, sexualiza a la mujer, alcohol, muerte.💚 Hugo logra cautivarte como a todas las personas del libro. Es una persona real, que no se justifica ni necesita hacerlo en ningún momento ante nadie, segura de si misma, que muestra tener sentimientos, amor, empatía pero también astucia, persistencia y dureza. Evelyn se ha convertido como en mi safe place, es un persona que he querido tener al lado, abrazar, hablar con ella y saber más de ella. ⭐️ es una biografía ficticia de lo más real, lo he sentido todo cómo si realmente hubiera pasado, con las noticias, la prensa, todas las imágenes que se pasaban por mi cabeza. Pensé que Hugo era una actriz real, junto con sus amigos, me dejo con una sensación de los más rara, como si fuera una historia real pero a la vez no. Este libro ha sido muy especial.🏆 Me ha impactado en cierta forma todo el mundo del espectáculo y Hollywood y me ha hecho replantearme muchísimas cosas. Viéndolo todo desde el mundo de una persona conocida, qué y como ha sido capaz de gestionar ciertas situaciones para manipular a la prensa y etc. A parte de eso, todo lo que enseña este libro, las frases, conversaciones, todo ha sido una maravilla.🎞 De mis personajes favoritos fue Harry, la verdad que me ha encantado la relación que se ha desarrollado a lo largo de toda la historia, me ha parecido también un personaje muy real y único.📝 La forma en la que esta escrito el libro me encantó, súper adictivo y rápido de leer. Te metes demasiado en la historia y te logra vivirlo todo en primera persona. 📈 Fue un libro muy doloroso, muy emocionante y muy real de leer. Se conseguía sentir el miedo y la frustración de Evelyn en cada momento al igual que la felicidad y el amor. Eso me hizo tener mil sensaciones a lo largo del libro, y de pasar tener un amor odio a Evelyn la amé .📖 Aparte me encantó que hubiera una su trama de la protagonista principal, donde pudimos ver todo el aprendizaje que le aportó Hugo y cómo afectó en sus decisiones.En general es un libro que sinceramente opino que merece su hype, y si, se ha convertido en uno de mis favoritos. Hacía mucho que un libro no me conseguía sentirme débil y experimentar mil sensaciones. Pensé que no conseguiría sacarme ninguna lagrima al igual que hice mil suposiciones que me dejaron 🤡 además tiene representación 🏳️‍🌈 y crítica al racismo."
207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58496095-book-roast,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was very close to 5 stars! I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even though biographies (real or fictional) is not something I gravitate towards. I feel this book, if read at a right time, could be one that slightly alters your perspective on life and that's HUGE. It will definitely be one I remember for a while. In short, this is about a famous Hollywood actress who is known for never doing interviews. She then offers our other main character, a starting journalist, an opportunity of a lifetime - to write her biography. Evelyn is a woman known for her 7 husbands, however when asked which one was her true love, an 8th person is the answer. This is a love that was very much forbidden during her career years.This book addresses so many brilliant topic (and does them justice!) such as cultural identity, fame, grief, greed, abuse, society's norms that restrict your life and how it can ruin so many lives without even being aware of it, and so much more.I couldn't put it down, despite the fact that this is not a tale of adventure. It makes sense that I enjoyed it so much as I am a character driven person. But you keep on reading even through the slower bits because you really do want to know why did Evelyn pick our reporter for the story, and oh boy - the twist! There was nothing inherently wrong with the book at all, I think it explored our society and complex emotions really well and in a easy to stomach manner. However the plot can be quite draggy at times and the atmosphere was not the strongest (not that it set out to be so, it's just a category in my rating system). Logic, intrigue and enjoyment were the strongest points to me.Highly recommend you give it a go even if this is something outside of your reading tastes. Maybe even more so!*Slight trigger warning for physical, emotional and sexual abuse"

I want to start off by thanking everyone who always likes and comments on my reviews, y'all are some of the sweetest people I have ever met!!! I appreciate everyone's kind words!! I apologize for how long it took me to finish this book and get my review up there. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was so so good!!! Taylor Jenkins Reid is such a good author, and I love reading her books. I was hooked from the very first page, and was not once let go in following the story. Some of y'all might disagree with me, which is totally okay, but Harry Cameron was one of my favorite characters, he was the absolute sweetest towards Evelyn. Harry is exactly the type of best friend I would want. I honestly loved the ending so much. Overall this was just a really good book and I loved every minute of it!!!!First off, I want to thank Hayley for buddy reading this with me<3!!!""I had learned all too well that pain was sometimes stronger than the need to keep up appearances"". In The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo we follow the journey of Evelyn Hugo and the stories of her seven husbands. Monique Grant is working for Vivant, a social media company, when she is requested to interview Evelyn Hugo. Evelyn is a very famous movie actress who has refused to give interviews for years. Evelyn starts to reveal her story to Monique that life isn't perfect, no one is perfect, people are just more than one thing, that relationships are complicated, and aren't always easy, the power of forgiveness and that it can be reinvented, the prospect of family, loss, and accepting others as who they are. No body should be judged for what they like, how they look, who they love. Evelyn Hugo is an aging and reclusive Hollywood icon who is ready to tell her story, and the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. Evelyn has chosen Monique to tell her story because Evelyn knows Monique has the power to do so. Evelyn has also read other pieces that Monique has written in the past. When Monique hears that Evelyn Hugo wants to do a piece with her, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? and why now? Monique is an unknown magazine reporter and Evelyn knows that Monique has the potential of getting her story put out there the way Evelyn wants people to know the truth about who she really is. Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jump start her career. Evelyn did not have an easy childhood growing up, she rose to fame on her own with some help from known people. Monique is summoned to Evelyn's luxurious apartment where she listens in fascination as Evelyn tells her story. Monique is there to take notes as to what is supposed to be in Evelyn's story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950's to her decision to leave the show business in the 80's, and of course the seven husbands along the way. Evelyn speaks a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendships, and a great forbidden love. The road to fame wasn't always easy for Evelyn, there were always dips in the road and sacrifices that had to be made. Monique starts to feel a very real connection to Evelyn, but as Evelyn's story nears it's conclusion, it becomes so clear that her life intersects with Monique's own in tragic and irreversible ways."

I listened to this on audio, and it was a wonderful time.When I started reading this I had no idea that with each husband, I’d grow ever deeper in love with Evelyn Hugo. This is a closer look at the life behind the glitz and glamour of Old Hollywood, where the cost of fame and fortune may be greater than you expected. It explores the manipulation of people without regrets, the lengths people will go to for fame, and at the heart of it it’s about a great, all consuming love affair. Evelyn is a star. A beautiful, shrewd star. As she tells her life story to Monique, a journalist she’s actively sought out to tell her story to, we see her shed the hidden layers and lies she’s held on to her whole life. What starts as a guarded confession to the great love of her life quickly turns into something far more encompassing, and demonstrates just what sacrifices Evelyn has made to hide her true self, and protect those she loves at all cost. She doesn’t regret, she doesn’t forget, and because of this you may think that Evelyn might be quite emotionless. But she’s far from it. She’s an actress, born to display only what she wants the world to see, yet we see moments of true vulnerability scattered throughout the story. She’s complex and unpredictable, with a strong sense of pride and self. She’s under no illusions that she’s a good person, and that’s what makes her so deliciously intoxicating to read about. She’s the heroine and the villain. I love the way the plot unfolds, told chronologically from the introduction of each new husband, scattered together with the present day and Monique’s story. Both characters bounce off each other well, as Monique struggles to assert herself against Evelyn’s dominant personality at first, before using her as an example to sort out her own life problems. I worked out the link between the two women quite quickly into the establishment of the story, but that didn’t spoil it at all. Far from it, I think the reader is suppose to know the real reason for the meeting between these two women before Monique is told the truth. It adds to the complexity of the characters, and enhances Evelyn’s moral ambiguity. The secondary characters who support Evelyn’s journey are also wonderfully fleshed out, especially Harry and Celia. Without them this story would be missing the heart that it needs as they help to show the softer side of her personality and shape Evelyn into a better person. There are moments of grief, laughter and love between them all that’s beautiful to read. It’s their stories, all woven together at times, that adds such a richness to the story. The husbands all pale into the background by comparison.Highly recommend. This isn’t my normal genre, but I’m so glad I had the opportunity to read this. It’s utterly remarkable, and very well written."

Don’t do that.”🌟 Do not judge a book by its cover.Never have this saying been truer, I had used this saying before when I read books with good covers but were disappointing. This was the total opposite! I never thought that I would like this book, I even hate the cover and did not want to read this in the first place!🌟 My friend Lizzy (A million thanks to you) recommended this to me when I once asked for books with great plots. I haven’t heard of the book at that time but then it started appearing on my news-feed at GR with tons of positive reviews.🌟 I have seen people who hate HP, Six of Crows, A darker shade of magic and any book you can think of. But I swear I haven’t seen a single negative review for this until I went to the book page and meticulously searched for one.🌟 This book lives up to the hype! It was so effing realistic that I thought Evelyn Hugo was a real character, I recommended this to a friend who started it immediately and told me the same thing, he thought she was real and he googled her.🌟 Evelyn will be one of the memorable characters that I read, she is morally gray and she is not perfect. She confess that she did some wrong things but she doesn’t regret them. The seven husbands were also unique and they represent all different kind of men, there was the greedy, the kind, the good and the bad! I can’t go into details as it will sure contain spoilers!🌟 And the writing is so good, this was my first book by Taylor Jenkins Reid but it definitely will not be the last! I can’t wait to read her other books. I highlighted half of the sentences (not really but you do get it).🌟 This book has something for every kind of reader. It has an amazing writing style and characters. It was character driven and I didn’t care if it had a plot twist or not (and it did) because I was so invested in the story.🌟 Summary & Prescription: I recommend this for everyone. “When you’re given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn’t give things, you take things.”"

It shouldn’t be, but this book proved that it is. And it wasn’t even my favourite part. I am immensely glad that this was my 300th book of the year. 
⇢The Plot & Writing
To say I wasn’t intrigued from the start would be a lie. Evelyn’s mysteriousness and subtle I’m-better-than-you-and-I-know-it personality had me invested in learning her story right from the very beginning, and the fact that she had chosen Monique to do the job for reasons unknown made me only too enraptured by her as well. Together, as storyteller and audience, they had an obvious connection that felt personal, almost as if they were family. But we’ll get into more of that later. The chapters that focused on Evelyn’s story were divided by her seven husbands, and each glimpse into her life was perfectly written. I felt connected to her each time despite the fact that with each new husband she became a different person, or rather, put on a new mask to fit the role she wanted to play. The whole thing just goes to show that nothing and no one is ever as they seem. I was certainly reminded of that many times.
“Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn't know her power, but I'm sick of all that.”
 
⇢The Characters
I fell in love with so many characters in this book. Of course Evelyn herself, with her cunning lies and hidden truths, Celia, with her faux innocence and true goodness, and Harry, the beautiful soul who perhaps resonated with me most of all. I even loved John, who we learned so little about, and Connor, who we didn't have nearly enough time with. Wise words from a certain character about whom I would read a whole other book:
“Isn’t it awfully convenient,” Harry added, “that when men make the rules, the one thing that’s looked down on the most is the one thing that would bear them the greatest threat? Imagine if every single woman on the planet wanted something in exchange when she gave up her body. You’d all be ruling the place. An armed populace. Only men like me would stand a chance against you. And that’s the last thing those assholes want, a world run by people like you and me.”

⇢The Storytelling
I loved the way this story was told. It wouldn’t have been the same if we had been following Evelyn’s life rather than seeing her tell it to Monique because revealing the truth after everyone else in it is dead has some sort of allure to it, doesn’t it? And then the way Evelyn’s story influenced Monique’s reality was fantastic. It showed just how important Evelyn’s story was because even before it was written it was allowing someone to take control of her life and be brave.
“Evelyn looks at me with purpose. ""Do you understand what I'm telling you? When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.”
 The interconnection and parallels between the past and the present were incredible. (I’m going to run out of positive adjectives at this point). I think my favourite was Evelyn and Harry’s platonic soulmate love in contrast to the philia (friendship-love) between Monique’s parents. The way Evelyn described her best friends was uncannily similar to the way Monique’s mother described her husband. 
“If there are all different types of soul mates,” I told Harry one afternoon, when the two of us were sitting out on the patio with Connor, “then you are one of mine.”
This book was obviously going to be heart-wrenching. I just didn’t realize quite how interconnected everything was going to be. Nothing affects me quite as a storyline that transcends generations. I suspected there was a deeper reason for Evelyn choosing Monique but I never guessed that it would be what it was. Overall, I understood Evelyn’s reasons for telling the truth, especially after experiencing her life in her own words. And after all, she did warn Monique that the worst was yet to come… I think what really resonated with me wasn’t just Evelyn Hugo and her story, but the fact that so many people must have gone through something similar. Not the movie stardom or the seven husbands, but the being in love with someone society tells you you can’t have. And Evelyn had Celia, albeit in secret. She had Harry. She had Connor. So many others must have gone through the same thing sans confidantes, and that, above all, is heartbreaking to consider. 
“Say to them, “Evelyn Hugo just wants to go home. It’s time for her to go to her daughter, and her lover, and her best friend, and her mother.” Tell them Evelyn Hugo says good-bye.”

Ich bin sehr dankbar, dass ich Evelyns Geschichte lesen und verinnerlichen durfte, ich konnte sehr viel daraus mitnehmen. In meinen Augen ist der Hype absolut gerechtfertigt. Die Autorin spielt mit Erwartungen, indem sie die Geschichte mit Wendungen in eine neue Richtung lenkt. Bei mir hat das dafür gesorgt, dass ich extrem gefesselt war und das Buch schier inhalieren wollte. Die Charaktere fühlen sich echt an, genau aus diesem Grund begleitet man sie mit einer Hassliebe. Mit ihren Facetten waren sie faszinierend und bedienen die ganze Palette an Emotionen: Stolz, Bewunderung, Enttäuschung, Wut. Ihre moralischen Konflikte und falschen Entscheidungen machen sie lebendig. Für mich ist dieses Buch sowohl ein Highlight als auch ein kleines Meisterwerk. Dazu tragen unter anderem auch der subtile Schreibstil, die übermittelten Botschaften und der Suchtfaktor bei. Ich kann’s sehr empfehlen🥰🫶🏼"
215,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108134955-asher,Rating 5 out of 5,"I trusted the hype, and I didn’t regret it. Booktok had me wondering with this book for a long time and I couldn’t get hold of myself and read it to see it for myself. And it was ‘worthy’ as it claimed to be after all.I think this isn’t a foreign book to everyone, but this novel follows the classy, elegant, scandalous, and iconic actress, Evelyn Hugo, as she told her story on how she had risen to high levels of fame in her glamourous days revolving around her seven husbands through a biography to be written by an unrenowned writer, Monique Grant, who also played a big part in the book.Reid’s simple yet addictive and vivid writing left my imagination come to life. She is such a talented writer and she never made the read weary from the first chapter to the last because she never settled for less and whenever a chapter was about to go dull, she finds unique ways to let you flip a page once more while at the same time she assures that you’re still on edge. And it was pretty easy for me to describe this as one of those books that will tear you apart and fix you up in an instant. With a single book, she was able to present both healthy and toxic relationships, and the different kinds of love: obsessive, familial, friendship, playful, enduring, and passionate.I admired Evelyn Hugo’s cunning personality as she navigated her way in a male-dominated society and brought fame to her name. It was the tragic and heartbreaking experiences that shape her as she is and although she was cold and fierce she made me pity her, mad at her, happy for her, and left me soaring with pride because of her, which made me effortlessly connected with her storyline. She never let anyone drag her down nor let herself be labelled and controlled by anyone else. She owned her sexuality especially since lgbtq+ in her period was still emerging from the shadows, not to mention the infamous paparazzis and gossipful tabloids.It made me ponder that everything is temporary so we should live our lives to the fullest extent, and it’s not the beauty, fame, or even money that will resonate with us when we get older, but it’s the moments we cherished the most with our loved ones. It also managed to speak up about gender inequality which gave voice and spotlight to all the women who are underestimated and underrepresented in the industry simply because they are women. It also subtly depicted the struggles of the lgbtq rights movements and campaigns back in the day which resulted to social change. And lastly, it left me to question what was Hollywood still hiding from us, if all of it was still real beneath the surface. It made me realized that most of what we see in films are, if not all, filtered from the truth and that it shapes the way we perceive in today’s society with unrealistic standards of perfection, stereotypes, and negative depiction of indigenous culture.Overall, this was excellent beyond words, so excellent that my standards went high because of this book, and I am eager to read more of Reid’s works in the future. 5 stars without hesitation!"

It was around that time that I started to believe that friendships could be written in the stars. “If there are all different types of soul mates,” I told Harry one afternoon, when the two of us were sitting out on the patio with Connor, “then you are one of mine.”
I went into this book blindly. I don’t know how I managed to dodge spoilers all this time, but the only thing I knew about this book was it’s about a Hollywood star named Evelyn Hugo, she was married seven times and that it's LGBTQ romance. It doesn’t really take a genius to figure all that out lol. 
It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.
What I didn’t expect is to get so invested in all these characters lives. Evelyn’s rise to fame, every single of Evelyn’s husband and how they contributed to the story, Evelyn and Harry’s beautiful friendship, Celia and Evelyn’s whirlwind relationship, Connor’s relationshp with her parents. These characters were so perfectly imperfect. The best example of characters perfectly written they seem real. 
“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.”
You know characters come and go, but Evelyn Hugo? She will be an icon and a legend forever and always, cause she is one in a lifetime. And Taylor Jenkins Reid? She immortalised herself with this book. But Harry Cameron? This precious soul will always own a small part of my heart. 
Harry put his hand on the doorknob, ready to go. “I’d like it if . . . I hope that we can still be friends, Evelyn. That we can still—”“Oh, shut up,” I said. “We’re best friends. Who may or may not tell each other everything. That doesn’t change. You still love me, right? Even though I’m about to be on the outs?”“I do.”“And I still love you. So that’s the end of it.” Harry smiled, relieved. “OK,” he said. “It’s me and you.”“Me and you, true blue.”
Conclusion
TSHOEH
 is one of those book that deserve a 5 star just because of the beautiful prose, intriguing characters AND unique storyline, but then I think Celia and get so annoyed, cause she really got on my nerves more often than not. I was also not that invested in the Monique story that much. Every time we get her chapter, I wished we would get back to the Evelyn flashback chapters. But overall, I think 
TSHOEB
 is one of those rare books that everyone should at least try to read once, even if it's not their genre or cup of tea."

An absolute masterpiece of a book
The life Evelyn had lived was truly a rollercoaster of events (hence the title) and her life was everything but dull. That woman really lived, lost and loved.During each flashback in the past, I felt like I could actually visualize each moment playing out and I loved the real life feel to it through Evelyn’s recollection of it. It was pure realism for me when it came to the storyline, pacing, plot and the writing — making it easy for me to connect with. Out of everyone, Harry will always hold a special place in my heart — I hated what happened to him 😭 the little reveal at the end definitely surprised me as I didn’t expect that and I was thinking all kinds of things. *As this is now going to be adapted into a movie, I could only see Rita Moreno playing older Evelyn*"

Evelyn Hugo is a total boss who shares her igniting and inspiring story while also showing that there is a side to her the world doesn't see - that we see only what we wish to see. "

And then there’s me . . . . . 

If you know me you’ve probably been just as surprised as I have that 2018 has somehow become my Summer of Chick Lit. I’ve ventured away from the porny and the stabby a tad more than usual and have come to truly enjoy what I have dubbed the “Mom Com.” But Evelyn Hugo??????

It was pretty extra when it came to being chicky. And pleeeeeeeeease for the love of all things that is holy don’t tell me “I read this wrong.” I most certainly did not. I totally got the messages that were being presented about being true to yourself and owning your sexuality and girl power and double standards and whathaveyou. The problem I had?????

Was this book intended for people of my mother/grandmother’s generation? Or does the author truly think we are so stupid that she felt she needed to beat us over the head rather than use any form of subtlety while making her points?Not to mention that Evelyn herself????

I did not enjoy her at all - and please note I'm a girl who can get down with stalkers and serial killers so that's really saying something about her lack of redeeming features.And THEN. Oh lordy be. THEN we not only got presented one “twist” that made me go . . . . 

But also a grand finale . . . . . 

Sorry to all my friends for (once again) being a disappointment to you all. What can I say?????

The saddest thing about this whole experience is I totally returned Maybe In Another Life by this author because my friend’s ratings were so low and got this one instead. I think I made the wrong decision and might have enjoyed the other one. I’ll be putting it back on Mt. TBR Pile.ORIGINAL ""REVIEW:""

220,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne,Rating 4 out of 5,"A fascinating look at the lives of the rich and famous as Evelyn Hugo, retired film actress and blonde bombshell, tells the story of her life. And what a life! Self made millionairess and Oscar winner, she has also made her way through seven husbands, some of them married for love and some for practical purposes. And yet none of them were the love of her life. Evelyn tells her story to Monique with whom she apparently has a link. We have to wait for almost all the book to find out what it is and it is quite a shocker! I really enjoyed reading this one. The story flowed along nicely in such a way that I wanted to keep going on to each successive chapter. I needed to find out what happened next! I thought the author handled several sensitive issues well especially as the attitudes of the day were quite different to now.A really entertaining read with great characters and a good story. It left me with lots to think about."

Da un lato basterebbero due parole: leggetelo ora.Dall'altro cercare di ""rinchiudere"" questo libro in una recensione mi sembra riduttivo e non so bene come farlo.Si tratta sicuramente di un romanzo vero, perché vero è il mondo che descrive, veri sono i personaggi, vere le difficoltà e le contraddizioni, vero il cinismo, veri i tradimenti, le manipolazioni e i tentativi di difendere ciò che si è ottenuto ad ogni costo.Evelyn Hugo è una protagonista tanto complessa quanto magnetica, la si può amare, la si può odiare ma la sua storia è talmente interessante che non si può posare il libro, si legge d'un fiato, marito dopo marito.Nonostante la relativa brevità del libro, la scrittura immediata e intensa mi ha trasmesso emozioni profonde (chi ha visto la live di domenica lo sa), quindi le cinque stelline sono più che meritate.P.s. leggetelo ora!"

While this one is no exception, it was a bit overwhelming. I think it's what I was expecting though, and why I kept putting it off. A character with seven husbands seemed like quite an undertaking, and now that I've read it still think it was.In this book, TJR created a poignant story about Evelyn Hugo, an iconic Old Hollywood actress. The story was over-the-top, yet believable. Evelyn was a shrewd and unapologetically manipulative woman who always knew how to come out ahead. This is the story about her life. While Evelyn's character was well developed, the other characters weren't. That kept Evelyn at the forefront throughout the story, as the iconic woman she was. "" ... all I was ever really looking for was family. Make sure it's clear that I found it. Make sure they know that I am heartbroken without it.""I'm glad I finally read this book. I've been looking forward to reading TJR's latest, but decided to read this one first. One of Evelyn's husbands, Mick Riva, is the father of the four Rivas in Malibu Rising)."
224,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128938274-sophie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Evelyn Hugo doesn't talk to the press anymore. She just doesn't. So when  Vivant,  one of the world's most famous magazine companies gets a call from her, asking specifically for Monique Grant to do a piece on her, they're all confused. Monique is a complete rookie. Why would Evelyn want to talk to her? When Monique arrives to interview the world's most famous starlet for the  Vivant  piece, Evelyn tells Monique that she is dying, and she wants Monique to write her autobiography. A tell-all. She's going to dish the dirt about her whole life, all 7 of her husbands, and the one true love of her life. I loved Evelyn as a character, she was just so powerful and unapologetic it made me weep. We love a lady who knows how the system works and uses it to her advantage. I still felt sad for her and all she had to sacrifice to be successful though, it makes me wish that the world worked differently. Rex was probably my favorite husband, aside from Harry, obviously. I just felt that he and Evelyn both had a really similar vibe, their relationship seemed businesslike and fairly straightforward until the end of it. I really liked Rex's character arc too. My least favorite husband was Max. Yes, I know Don should be my least favorite probably, and he is a total tool and an abusive piece of crap also, but I just can't stand the fact that Max acted like he was in love with Evelyn when really he was in love with the idea of her and the fame she brought him. I loved Connor and the goodness she brought out in Evelyn. I liked that despite how complicated and messy Evelyn's personal life was, that she was still an engaging and thoughtful mother. You knew in the beginning that Evelyn was probably connected to Monique in a twisty way, but the ending still totally got me and I did not see it coming at all! Genuine shock over here. I don't think I really realized the extent of what Evelyn did to Monique's dad until the very end, that whole scene was confusing to me, but at the end, I was like, ""OH. Well, ok, yeah, that was really messed up."" Overall, this book made me a little sad, but it also highlighted the sacrifices and the hard choices you have to make sometimes to protect the people you love. I liked it (:Happy reading <3"

In true Hollywood style, movie starlet Evelyn Hugo was presented to us as glamorous and sultry with an elusive vulnerability, plenty of scandal, and an array of various husbands! Every page brought Evelyn to life, and I was struck by how real she and all the characters were. Because Evelyn was complex and three-dimensional, we had a great discussion about her insight and wisdom shared with us through memorable quotes. One might think, based on the some of the topics, this book would be light or outlandish, but there was depth and several important messages conveyed by Evelyn's journey through her marriages and life in general. I admired Evelyn's strength. While I was frustrated with her at times, she never took the easy path. The acknowledgements section of the book is not to be missed. Taylor Jenkins Reid's words to her mom, husband, and daughter cemented the important messages of this book- grit and determination, acceptance (both inner acceptance and acceptance of others), and true love. Overall, I loved this book. It never went in the direction I thought it would, and it kept me flipping the pages. This was my second TJR book, and I have learned that when she writes on a topic and/or about characters, she brings them to life completely. Every page is important; every word has a purpose.

The boldness with which the story was narratedFor now, that is all I can think of (although I'm sure there must me more). Don't mind the unprofessionalism, by the way.

Cheers to that 🥂 To sum up what meager information I have included, this book is worth reading but I definitely don't see it going on my faves shelf in the near future. I may reread it again sometime because I can already foretell the pressure I will be put under, thanks to a particular friend who loves this book like I love Aaron Warner (which is to say, astronomically). Hey, at least I'm not THAT sleep deprived if I can still come up with words like ""astronomically"" and manage to spell it right on my first try. 🥲In any case, if there's one thing that finally picking up this book has taught me, it is to keep my expectations chained in an inescapable box if I don't wish to be tremendously let down 😞 This is ALSO the reason why I have decided to push back reading Colleen Hoover's novels.

Diles que a Evelyn Hugo no le importa si todos se olvidan de su nombre. A Evelyn Hugo no le importa si todos se olvidan de que alguna vez vivió. Mejor aún, recuérdales que Evelyn Hugo nunca existió. Fue una persona que yo inventé para ellos. Para que me quisieran. Diles que, durante mucho tiempo, estuve confundida con respecto a lo que era el amor. Diles que ahora lo entiendo, y que ya no necesito el amor de ellos.

AMAZING!!!	Realmente pensé que este libro no me iba a gustar WHAT A FOOL!! La premisa no me llamaba la atención, o sea ¿ leer sobre los siete maridos de una mujer? No es mi tipo de lecturas. Pero tiene tan buenas críticas que la puse en mi lista de quizás en un futuro pero me quedé sin lecturas y decidí leerlo  Es la mejor decisión que he tomado, porque me estaba perdiendo de un libro FANTÁSTICOLo primero que quiero destacar es la narrativa de la autora que es MARAVILLOSA, como empieza lentamente llevándote poco a poco enganchándote en la historia hasta que llegas un momento que estás tan metido en la trama que no puedes dejar de leer. ESTE LIBRO ES ADICTIVOLa historia de Evelyn Hugo podría haber sido la de Marilyn Monroe sino hubiera muerto, creo que Evelyn está basada en Marilyn. Evelyn Hugo fue una famosa actriz, desde la época de los 50´s a finales de los 80´s que se destacaba principalmente por su sensualidad y belleza. Ella contrata a una periodista y escritora para que escriba su autobiografía y se publique después de su muerte, lo curioso es que es escritora no es muy reconocida no tiene prestigio pero la pidió exclusivamente a ella. Durante la entrevista, Evelyn Hugo relata su historia de cómo empezó a soñar con ser actriz, cómo se convirtió en ello y llegó a la fama, los sacrificios que hizo como utilizó su cuerpo manipulo gente e hizo cosas moralmente cuestionables y en el proceso sus siete matrimonios que es por lo que más la recuerda la gente. También revela el misterio de quien de ellos fue el amor de su vida o ¿Será que ninguno de ellos fue realmente el amor de su vida?La autora nos lleva en un viaje en el tiempo de distintas épocas, pasamos por los 50´s la época de oro en Hollywood que fue de mis favoritas hasta llegar a los 80´s, detallando de las épocas de una manera no tan descriptiva, sino que te cuentas cosas como el vestuario, el comportamiento o eventos importantes que la caracterizaron.No se si ustedes vieron la bioserie de Silvia Pinal pues exactamente ese fue el vibe que me dio este libro que conocemos como comenzó, sus amantes, sus tragedias, sus momentos de felicidad, su fama y todo en ese viaje entre épocas.Hubo un momento que creí estar leyendo sobre un personaje real y me daban ganas de meterme a google y buscar imágenes de esta hermosa actriz, fotografías de los sucesos importantes hasta que recordaba que era un personaje ficticio.  y esto es nada más y menos que magia de la autora
Este es un libro, sobre la vida de una mujer llena de matices, algunos la pueden amar otras odiar pero nunca te va a dejar indiferente. Es un libro de sueños, sacrificios, traiciones, manipulaciones, pero sobre todo es un libro lleno de amor, amistad y la verdadera familia. 
Se los recomiendo ampliamente, y eso que no soy fan de recomendar libros porque para gustos los colores."

TLR doesn’t really include black characters in her books but when she does she goes us this? i could’ve gone with a “gasp” moment. don’t know why the girls love this book so much, y’all should want better for yourselves."

It was the BEST book I read this year, one of the BEST books I read, ever!This book and I clicked from the first page. It was one of those books I knew I would be thinking for a long time to come. When I was reading it, I was in it completely. When I was not reading it, I was thinking of it. Reid’s writing is exceptional. I think she has great talent, especially in characterisation. At some point, I was convinced Evelyn Hugo was a real person and I wanted to watch her movies. You know how they say for good actors, they get into the role and they act as if they are that person. I think it was very similar with Reid. She got into her own creation of a character, and delivered an amazing story that felt like real! It was so detailed, very well articulated. Both the plot and her character were captivating. So, my writing Oscar definitely goes to her. Another thing that makes the book addictive is, Evelyn Hugo. She is a very enchanting character. Her life is interesting. The way she tells her own story is very captivating. She’s definitely flawed, yet not apologetic. She knows who she is, learned a lot from her rollercoaster life, and has a lot of wisdom that comes with it. I really wish Evelyn Hugo was my friend 🙂There are other elements that make this book very rich. Diversity, sexuality, women at the workplace, LGBTQ rights. Most important of all, none of these feel forced. They were in the story organically, but very powerfully. In my opinion, one of the best examples of these topics brought into a book very naturally. So, another well done!Lastly, the book ends with a plot twist that I didn’t see coming! It was an amazing uplift at the end. It was very emotional & very touching. Taylor Jenkins Reid knows how to start with a high and how to leave you with a high.So, all I can say is if you haven’t read this book, you’re missing out on it every day. It’s that GOOD! I can’t fault it, really. It’s a delight page after page."
237,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn,Rating 5 out of 5,"For some reason, despite all the hype, I thought I wasn't going to like this novel based on the life of a glamorous actress and her seven marriages, but I was totally enthralled by it. Evelyn Hugo, now retired and living a reclusive life in New York has decided to auction her gowns for charity and to tell her life story, warts and all, to an aspiring junior magazine writer, Monique Grant. And what a story she has to tell! Monique has no idea why she has been chosen to write Evelyn's biography but is thrilled to be chosen and to listen to the details of Evelyn's life and loves over the course of several days. What she hears is certainly a different version of Evelyn's life to the public persona she was forced to present to support her fame and movie star status.The novel is a wonderful look not only at what it took to be a movie star from the 1950s to the 1980s - the pain, the struggle, having to keep up a publicly acceptable face - but also the changing times with regards to society's acceptance of sex, marriage and who you love. Listening to Evelyn's story gives Monique the strength and confidence to cope with the problems and changes in her own life and to accept who she is. Highly recommended for those who enjoy an absorbing read."

Nothing I write will do this book justice. But I guess I'll give it a try.We should start off with the main character - our dear Evelyn. Such a powerful character, straight forward, charismatic, captivating, inspiring. The more I read, the more I needed to know. All the characters have amazing well developed stories, and the interactions between them were so well written.It had been a long time since I had read such a good book, and I know it will be even a longer time for me to read something I enjoy as much - it really set the bar high. No need to say it became my favourite book, and I´ll keep recommending it until everyone reads it."

The plot was so well done and the story so enticing that it took me all of one day to finish this book. I was barely able to talk to anyone today without getting distracted by thoughts about Evelyn and what was going to happen to her. Basically, I ignored everyone today and focused entirely on this amazing book. Every chapter left me wanting to find out more. It was definitely one of the most addictive books I’ve ever read.I especially loved how it adresses important issues such as domestic abuse and homophobia. I feel more informed now that I’ve read it.Despite the fact that this book delivered an inspiring, compelling, beautiful (you name it) story, the writing style was not for me. It was definitely lacking a little something to make it more original.This was an emotional roller coaster and I am SO glad that I read. Thank you booktok for this recommendation :)"

Monique did nothing for me. And the narrator who handles her part felt too old. Once the book turned more to Evelyn, it did become more interesting. I love the atmosphere of “old Hollywood” that this evokes. Think the old movie magazines, the gossip, the star makers and breakers. Evelyn has her secrets but she’s finally willing to tell her true story. Evelyn is a strong woman and willing to do whatever it takes for her career. Growing up poor, she was never going back there again. I can’t say I agreed with all her moves, but I appreciated her resolve. While it’s a story of the old days, it’s truly a story for today. It deals with defying labels. In the end, it’s a love story. Parts were somewhat unbelievable. And at times, it dragged. But overall, a pleasant, interesting listening experience. "

This is one of the best books I have read. I read about 20% of the book last night and could not wait to finish reading it today. I even went to bed thinking about this dynamic story. It is the story of a magnetic actress in old time Hollywood and her life that includes seven husbands, the controversial (at the time) love of her life, a daughter, a true friend, and a career she had to recreate multiple times in her life. Her struggling as an actress, wife, lover, friend and especially mother was addicting to read about. Not to mention that we get the mystery of why she chose Monique to tell her story. It is just a profound book!My quick and simple overall: get this book now and read it! You will not regret it!

251,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7971097-bentley-bookbastion-net,Rating 5 out of 5,"See this review and more like it on www.bookbastion.netWhen I think back on my reading habits from a year ago and compare them to today, it makes me so glad that I started book blogging. Without this wonderful community of avid readers, I never would have discovered this book. It is far outside what I'd normally pick for myself to read, but finding it was like finding a diamond in the rough, if the rough is the bookstore I was unleashed onto when I committed to buying it. Thanks to a few fellow reviewers I trust completely who were raving about it, I decided to step outside my comfort zone and try a new genre for a change. I'm so glad I did because this was stunning, and Evelyn's story moved me in ways I didn't anticipate it would when I started.I like to think this dichotomy between the cover and the unexpected intricacies of Evelyn's story was a clever deception on the author and publisher's part. Giving this book a title that mirrors tabloid headlines about a Hollywood icon is very in keeping with the way Evelyn is valued by the industry itself. An industry in which her worth is directly correlated to her appearance as Evelyn Hugo, the actress, while disregarding the complexities and intricacies present in Evelyn Herrera, the woman behind the icon. Watching Evelyn's story unfold was the most fun I've had all year. I couldn't put this book down. A reader might think they've got her figured out, and then Taylor Jenkins Reid goes ahead and peels back another layer. Part of me would love to shout from the rooftops some of the spoilers present in this story because I loved them, but I think the journey through to those revelations is too important to spoil. For a story set in the decades between 1950 and the present, the themes and political discourse that is threaded through the narrative are still stark and important. For those of you who seek diversity in your stories, I hope you've got this novel on your radar. Evelyn and Monique are both WOC and there are more diverse characters as well. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a master at weaving their experiences as women with thematic elements of love, self-discovery and embracing truths that are not always self-evident into both her lead character's journeys. Their stories are topical, relevant and achingly real. They serve as an especially important reminder for those who might assign value onto women (and celebrity icons) for their appearance and status while failing to recognize the person behind the image - and that we all make flawed choices from time to time.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is brilliant, compelling and a triumph of my reading year thus far. I'm going to keep my eye out for more books by this author in the future.★★★★★ = 5/5 stars"

Evelyn started her career in the 50’s now she’s 79 years old and wants the world to know her real story. It’s time to tell the truth, she seconders Monique an unknown journalist to do just that … write a biography, tell her story.This book gives us insight to her life, ambitions, friendships, love and scandal. Evelyn peels back the layers of the life she portrayed to the outside world to reveal her real life. It’s about telling the truth, her relationships, the seven husbands and the sacrifices she made to protect the ones she loved. It was heartbreaking, emotive this book captivated me from the very beginning.

255,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42662881-fadwa,Rating 5 out of 5,"Full review originally posted on my blog: Word WondersJanuary 2022 update: My review title says this is the only book I will never recover from. My assessment five years ago was correct. I still sobbed uncontrollably reading it for the 7th time.CW: Sexual assault, statutory rape, domestic physical abuse, cheating, homophobia, biphobia, alcoholism, death of loved ones, serious illnesses, mentions of suicide.Since last december, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was ALL over my twitter timeline, everytime one of my friends read it, they became obsessed with it and joined the hype train, so it just kept getting more and more hype everyday so I eventually caved at the end of January and got it. And let me tell you. I don’t think any of my words will ever do it justice. It’s just too good, and it deserves every single praise I’ve heard about it and more. My expectations for it were sky-rocketing and it STILL managed to go above them, and fairly easily. All this to say that this review will be a struggle to write and I apologize in advance if it only half makes sense.The writing is beautiful. It’s raw, emotional and brutally honest. Which fits Evelyn’s character perfectly. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an amazing writer, the way she threads words together to make impactful sentences astounds me. There’s also the fact that she ends some of the more important chapters with these cliffhanger type sentences that scare the shit out of you and make you want to stop while everything and everyone is okay, while simultaneously compelling you to keep reading.The book is written from two POVs. It starts off with Monique’s but it’s mostly carried by Evelyn’s and spanning throughout multiple decades following her from age fourteen until well after she retired . I wouldn’t say it alternates because it’s not exactly true. Besides a few chapters at the start and at the end, most of the book is from Evelyn’s perspective as she tells her truth and life story. Monique’s chapters in the middle serve as a break between different stages of Evelyn’s life.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo starts with the question “Who is Evelyn Hugo’s one true love?” and the answer is given pretty early on so putting it in this review wouldn’t really be a spoiler but the book is an experience for the reader so I don’t want to give any piece of it away. Especially not about the characters (besides Evelyn and Monique) because Evelyn’s relationships with them are what makes the story what it is. While reading this book, I couldn’t help but feel it navigating in a grey area from start to finish. Nothing and no one is ever defined as good or bad and in my opinion, that’s what makes it so great. It’s just so real and complex.Through Evelyn Hugo’s experiences as a queer woman of color (bisexual and cuban to be exact), the author explores Old Hollywood and the many issues a woman like her could encounter during that time. The sexism, her male peers’ needs always being above hers. The racism, having to change her name, hair color, language and accent to *pass* and succeed in the industry. But more than anything, the terrible queerphobia at the time and its very real consequences on her life and relationships. The pain of having to hide a huge part of her identity (with others) and the fear that comes with the life threatening possibility of being outted. There was a gutting quote in the book that just said it all:“You imagine a world where the two of you can go out to dinner on a Saturday night, and no one thinks twice about it. It makes you want to cry, the simplicity of it. The smallness of it. You have worked so hard for a life so grand. And now all you want are the smallest freedoms. The daily peace of loving plainly.”Granted, this described above is still the reality of a lot of queer people today but back then it was EVERY SINGLE queer person’s reality. It was constant hiding for everyone with the inevitable strain that can put on relationships.The title can be misleading because you would go in expecting to learn all about Evelyn’s seven husbands and although that’s there and every section of the book is named after one of them, it’s not the main focus of the book. It’s main focus is our protagonist sharing her truth, unfiltered. This is about her paving her way in a world that’s set on bringing her down. Her wins, her losses. Her struggles. All the scandals and back stabbing. All the decisions she had to make, why she made them and their rippling consequences. Her story is so deep and multilayered, it’s ultimately heartbreaking but it had its happy moments.I think that what makes this book mine and a lot of people’s favourite (or, one of them at least) is Evelyn herself as a character. She’s one of the best or THE best crafted character I’ve ever read about. A walking, talking, mezmerizing, breathtakingly beautiful, mystery. And no matter how many terrible decisions she made I still admired her because she knew what she wanted and had the gutts to do whatever it takes to get it. She’s in no means a good person, in fact, she’s quite awful but so captivating that you can’t help but fall in love with her. She’s strong, confident, ambitous and extremely smart. I was fascinated and compelled by the way her brain worked and connected things, how she could get herself out of the most impossible situations. I think that what makes it impossible to hate her is that she’s fully aware of her actions ad that she owns up to them and never tries to hide who she really is.The other *main* character is Monique. I put that between * because to me, she didn’t really feel like a main character, she was more like a vessel to carry Evelyn’s story. Don’t get me wrong, she has a strong character arc but it felt a bit overshadowed by Evelyn’s. Monique is a thirty five year old biracial black woman who just got separated and feels stuck in her career. I quite liked her to be honest and how through discovering Evelyn’s story, she was inspired to take life by the horns and not be afraid to pursue what she really wants. I really liked seeing her bloom in that sense.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a book that moved me deeply and that I know will stick with me my whole life. It touched me and resonated with me in such deep ways that I couldn’t help but fall head over heels for it. It just put a lot of my thoughts and feelings into words that I struggled finding for myself."

It was good getting to know Evelyn Hugo, a star, a bombshell, a lover and a mother.The thing that amazes me about Evelyn was how cut-throat she was. She was truly fixated on what she wanted and THAT was inspiring. She reminded me of Scarlet O' Hara at times. Definitely, this is one of the books that will bring a change of attitude in readers. Anyone who reads this book, is sure to become motivated, stubborn and unstoppable. They are going to get what they want. [ After they finish reading the book :P]Evelyn Hugo, the scandalous star with seven husbands was a gossip stream that never dried up. It was upsetting that her life revolved too much around manipulating what people talked about her. Although, the magazine articles that come in between the chapters were enjoyable. The dramatic events were told in the most juicy way possible. [Extra points]It is an amazing story about a person who craved too much of one thing-- fame. It brought her no good in the end and she regrets it later. It was a sad, sad story. Her entire journey feels sad to read even though she is successful. That is the victory of the book. To have made me feel pity for a ruthless, arrogant person."

259,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49444196-katie-b,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 starsI fell in love instantly with the cover of the hardback edition. When I found out it was a story about an actress during the Old Hollywood era, I knew I had to get my hands on this book as I love that type of stuff. I am so glad to report back this is a book that is worthy of the hype!Aging Hollywood star Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell her life story. But she's only willing to spill her secrets to Monique Grant, a fairly unknown magazine reporter. Monique's husband has just left her and taking on this job opportunity might provide a healthy distraction and potentially be a huge career booster. As she learns more and more about Evelyn, Monique realizes ambition can sometimes come at a cost.This is the type of book that I think everyone might take away something different. Love is certainly a theme of the book whether it be romantic relationships, friendships or even the lengths parents are willing to go to for their child. For me the strength of the book was just Evelyn. The author did an amazing job capturing this complicated woman. I love these types of books that span a person's lifetime and you get to share in pivotal moments in their life, the good and the bad. Showing old Hollywood with the glamour and also the seedy side really added to the story as well.I only have a teeny, tiny criticism and that is I just wish I would have connected more with one of the relationships in Evelyn's life. Other than a few touching moments towards the end, I was disappointed I didn't feel more. I guess that's why even though I did love the book, it didn't quite reach 5 star level. However, this truly is a gem of a book and I don't hesitate in recommending it if you haven't already checked it out!"

264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44553133-danielle-pretty-mess-reading,Rating 5 out of 5,"*****5 STARS*****Full review here. . . https://wp.me/p7ZSCH-4iSEvelyn Hugo is glamor, glamor, glamor. Evelyn Hugo is also complex, complicated, and a master manipulator. She’s a bitch too, which I love. I think her inner bitch spoke to mine, which made me fall in love with her.I knew I was going to like Evelyn Hugo after reading one of her first statements.

“I was gorgeous, even at fourteen. Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn’t know her power, but I’m sick of all that. I turned heads. . .I’m not going to sit here and say, ‘Aw, shuck. People really thought I was pretty?’ like some kind of prig.” – Evelyn Hugo

A woman after my own heart. I just fucking love her.Evelyn is at a point in her life where she is ready to tell her story and she will only do so with one person, Monique. Monique is a journalist in New York with a popular magazine and wants nothing more than to get inside of Evelyn’s head. Both Evelyn and Monique are women of color which adds a deeper level to this book. Taylor Jenkins Reid was able to address racial divides and issues without it overshadowing the story. It was a magnificent addition on her part.This story is told from Monique and Evelyn’s points of view. I really love the way the author interchanged the two women’s voices.If you are like me, the title had me intrigued. Who doesn’t want to hear about a famous movie star with who had seven husbands, marrying seven times and divorced many times – the woman telling it had no problem with divorce, obviously.

“I guess I don’t take divorce as lightly as you.”“If you did, at your age, you’d be a cynic.”“But at your age?”“With my experience? A realist.”“That, in and of itself, is awfully cynical, don’t you thing? Divorce is loss.”“Heartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.” – Monique/Evelyn

At some point in the book, we as readers, have to decide how we feel about Evelyn deep down related to some of the choices she made.

“I’m not a good person, Monique. . . I did a lot of things that hurt a lot of people. . .”“You don’t seem so bad, Evelyn.”“You, of all people, are going to change your mind about that. Very soon.” – Evelyn/Monique

I’m trying to be as spoiler free as possible and so far I’m doing a really good fucking job. All in all, my point is this – GO and READ this damn BOOK! If you don’t end up liking it, I’m about to be like Evelyn and say, ‘I don’t give a fuck’. No, I’m just kidding. I care about you. I do hope you will give this one a try. It’s not your typical romance story, it’s so much more.Let’s get to the important questions. . .Do I recommend this book? Yes, I do.Will I read another book by this author? Fuck, yeah! I wish I would have known about her sooner.
Remember to follow all things messy. . .

“When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things.” 
I’m so sensitive that if someone poked me, I’d cry. Taylor Jenkins Reid, you could've made my life easier. I already have 99 problems and heart failure isn’t going to be one of them. If I somehow end up at the hospital……..you will cover the bill, right? I spent all my life savings on tissue boxes. It’s the least you can do. You owe me. advice to author:  you should get sponsored by a tissue company.  listen guys This book fucked me up so good that I can relate to those people who take 3 years to place an order at a fast food restaurant because they don't know want they want. Well, I don't know what I want to say.  I'm incapable of justifying my emotions. What I do know is that, the editor was totally aware of the pain and suffering I will experience in this book. I bet you on all the grass in this planet that they did some evil laugh and sat back like: I, Tweebs, solemnly swear that it does sucks to be me right now. This book came into my life, messed everything up, and left.  Just freakin left  You ever finish a book and then it's all you ever think about? Okay......idk what kind of question that is.......i know everyone experiences this......i hope you do........i experience this with probably every book i read....probably being the key word.......but the point is that I just couldn't shake this book off. I couldn't stop thinking about it. It blew my freakin mind. I felt so satisfied but yet, unsatisfied. I would literally sit down to drink water and find myself zoning out.......straight back into this world. 
“That’s the part I was stuck in, the part where you accept the apology because it’s easier than addressing the root of the problem.”
 I never understood how I carried on with my life without knowing this gem existed. How could I sleep? How could I eat chocolate chip muffins? How could my family look me in the eye knowing I did, Taylor Jenkins Reid, dirty by ignoring this book. If you're looking at this book right now and wondering if it's only about a lady and 7 dudes...let me list it out for you: ✓ you're so wrong.✓ you're about to get mind fucked in 1000 ways ✓ you're gonna join me in the, ""tears. tears everywhere""  club ✓ YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT Y'ALL ARE ABOUT TO WALK INTO !! That is all. Trust me, I'm your prime example. I played the biggest joke on myself by ignoring this book thinking it was based on that reason.
me discovering how stupid I was 
""stupidity at it's finest"" a novel by TweebsThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, completely took me by surprise. It was authentic, inspiring, and gut-wrenching. This is a goddamn masterpiece and I want the title of the book tattooed on my forehead. I know........the love is that real. Can you see me trying to lure you into the dark side? I need more people understanding how it feels to watch their emotions escalate to a point where you can't put a leash on it and tell it to stop. And there's no stopping it. From one person to another, it might feel like I'm preparing you for the biggest battle of your life but trust me, you would love every single moment. Do you ever just look at a book and know what it's going to do to you. I had the sense it was gonna leave me devastated but i didn't know what level of devastation. Let me tell you as soon as I finished this, I was left laying on the floor surrounded by a puddle of my tears.it's a hard life being a reader. shoutout to those who get me. am i right or am i right?
“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is “You’re safe with me”—that’s intimacy.” 
How could I describe this book to you? Well, the plot will definitely fucking grab you by the hand and show you everything you've never known. I literally died in every page. This is a type of book where you don't want to know too much information about the plot. You'd be on an emotional roller coaster but hey let me tell you..........it's worth it. Also in my opinion, it's 10000 times better to watch the plot unravel and come apart. This book had me flipping through the pages so quick that I nearly gave myself a paper cut...and ain't nobody want to experience that type of pain. Yeah, it was that  powerful, mesmerizing, and unique that it almost had me drawing blood. 
“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.”
It tackles so many tough issues that literally demands to be acknowledged and understood. It's a damn good eye opener. Everything impacted me in some kind of way. I loved how TJR shed a light on these issues and HANDLED IT LIKE A BOSS !! I want to throw this at every single person. So, if a book gets thrown in your face....it wasn't me. but it was me.I had the opportunity to step into someone else's shoes and experience a story that quite literally, fucked me up. Evelyn Hugo is our main character and you know right off the bat that she's not perfect from the beginning. The plot officially begins when Evelyn is ready to confess her hidden story and have the world know who she truly is. She is realistic and very compelling. She is brutally honest and makes mistakes. She will do anything for anyone she loves. Most importantly, 
She is flawed and she knows it. 
 I will not get into the other characters because I rather you read it and discover about them on your own. Or it's the fact that I don't know where to start on my love for certain characters that legit have me debating whether I should send a message to TJR asking her if i somehow wronged her in the past life. Okay, this is completely unrelated but I can't possibly be the only one who believes that these characters are real??? You know this book seriously got under my skin when I ended up on Google searching about these characters and whether they are real.You want to know??? No, they are absolutely not real. And let's discuss TJR's writing style though. Can we get an applause up in here ?? I'm clapping like a damn walrus right now. I'm so giving this the emoji heart eye right now like wowowowow. I have lost the ability to explain myself.
“Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.” 
This is the first book I've ever read by Taylor Jenkins Reid and I'm amazed. I'm not saying that  I'm going to binge read all her books but that's exactly what I'm saying. Am I gonna sign myself up for even more uncontrollable emotions?? Yeah, I really am but sshhhh have some faith in me. I think I can manage. this is all lies I hope y'all get the chance to read this and If you don't pick this up, I will do this to you in a heartbeat :) "
268,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61150031-lo,Rating 5 out of 5," “Sometimes things happen so quickly you aren’t sure when you even realised they were about to begin.”Every so often a story comes along that you will cherish, that you will re-visit on a regular basis as old friends and you will think of often. For me  The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo  was one of those stories, the last time I felt like that was the Harry Potter Series.  ""You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says ""It's ok, you can fall down. I'll catch you."" I found this book to be one that I couldn’t read through at pace, not because of a lack of interesting story or characters but because I wanted to take the time to let the words wash over me and envelop myself in the world created by Taylor Jenkins Reid, and what a world she created. My heart raced and stopped, at moments it took my breath away and I remembered why I feel in love with reading. When I finally read the last page and closed the book my goosebumps had goosebumps. I had gladly been on the most amazing emotional roller-coaster and I was so happy that I had.I was mesmerized by Evelyn from the first introduction, she always knew when to feed me that little extra bit of information to keep me captivated, desperate to read on but also cautious that I didn’t want the story to end any time soon. Reid perfectly captures the glamour and the seedy underside (at least of what it was like for the women) of old Hollywood in a way that truly transports you to the times and places that she is creating. So much so that when the narrative comes back to Evelyn telling her life story to Monique you, as the reader, feel like you are coming out of a wonderful dream. ""I made it fifty-fifty. Which is about the cruelest thing you can do to someone you love, give them just enough good to make them stick through a hell of a lot of bad.""The framing of the novel through the seven husbands of Evelyn is a wonderful way to move through the years of a long life that doesn’t feel onerous or stale. It worked perfectly that they were framing the story because it meant that that while they were points in the timeline, they were only there as phases of the life of Evelyn, so it never allowed the story to become about the men of her life. And the titles for each phase of her life related to who she was married to were always intriguing and constantly in my head as I tried to figure out how they earnt such introduction. “People are messy, and love can be ugly. I’m inclined to always err on the side of compassion.” I think that the way sexuality is dealt with in this story is beautiful, it is raw, real and passionate and ultimately is a timely reminder that it wasn’t all that long ago that people could be arrested or declared mentally unwell just because of who they loved and/or desired. The fear that people lived with and the bravery that it took for the people who have paved the way for this generation of LGBTQ+ people to do be who they are should never be forgotten (even if that bravery transpired as making enough money to fund the work of the people fighting for LGBTQ+ rights), while acknowledging the struggles that are still ongoing. There are wonderful moments in this book that I felt really got to the heart of what it is to be bisexual and the importance of that story cannot be underestimated. It shows why people should fight to prevent others defining them. So often bisexuality is ignored as its own narrative. “I’m bisexual. Don’t ignore half of me so that you can fit me into a box Monique. Don’t do that.” “I was a lesbian when she loved me and a straight woman when she hated me.” I can honestly say that I have never been as satisfied with the ending of a novel as I was when I finished The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Everything came full circle, it felt true to the characters and honest to the world that had been created, even if at times it broke my heart.Ultimately, this is a phenomenal book that I cannot recommend highly enough, it is definitely up there with Harry Potter as my favorite reads. There are so many words of wisdom (that I really wanted to put in the review but it would have made it far too long!) that I will draw upon through different times in my life. “You wonder what it must be like to be a man, to be so confident that the final say is yours.”"

270,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119137053-sa,Rating 5 out of 5,"5/5No entiendo nada Mañana hago una reseña presentable porque estoy de luto por mi estabilidad emocional. un beso-------------------------------------- No sé por qué mi -intento de- reseña terminó con casi 100 likes pero me encanta ahre.---------------------------------------Ahora si. Sigamos. Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo es un libro recontra hypeado y no lo iba a leer hasta que me agarró el bichito de necesidad y lo compré (la gente más cercana ya habrá escuchado la historia pero básicamente el libro apareció en la librería de la nada cuando lo pedí y me pareció una señal y lo compré. Spoiler: creo firmemente que fue una señal). Tenía mUCHo miedo de leerlo por el hype pero me llevé una excelente sorpresa. Esta historia trata sobre superación y los grises en la vida. De la familia y el amor. De los extremos y los opuestos. De lo bueno y lo malo. De lo permitido y lo prohibido. Del querer, el desear y la obligación. Del crecimiento y la aceptación. Es un libro que desde un principio Evelyn dice que no es un ejemplo; que no es una buena persona y no está arrepentida de nada de lo que hizo. Nos presenta una tonalidad de grises completa a medida que pasa el tiempo y cambia de marido; a sí mismo nos presenta como ella va cambiando y madurando mientras continuamos la historia. Me pareció excelente, una hermosa historia y la complejidad del personaje de Evelyn hizo que me dieran ganas de releerlo al momento que cerré el libro.  Evelyn me enseño muchísimo y, si bien no pienso ponerla en un pedestal y ponerla de ejemplo en todo, espero tenerla presente para cuando dude y no sepa que tomar de la vida.  Les dejo un fragmento para que disfruten: —¿Entiendes lo que quiero decirte? Cuando te dan una oportunidad de cambiar tu vida, debes estar dispuesta a hacer lo que sea con tal de lograrlo. El mundo no te da cosas: tú debes tomarlas. Si vas a aprender algo de mí, probablemente debería ser eso. Si son atrasadxs como yo y todavía no lo leyeron; leanlo. Lxs obligo. "
271,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277371-marialyce-back-in-the-usa,Rating 4 out of 5,"The life portrayed in this book of Evelyn Hugo is not surprising to many who have followed what goes on in Hollywood. Many in the movie business will do anything, be anyone, sacrifice their own inner selves for the fame and fortune offered by tinseltown. Evelyn was no exception.Evelyn became a movie star in the fifties. Her ability and her beauty carried her into decades of fame. However, her way of achieving and keeping that fame and those cameras clicking propelled her through seven husbands while hiding a secret that would have destroyed her career.Evelyn sacrificed herself and what she truly wanted to make herself happy to be a star. Her life seemed to be one of manipulation, always plotting and planning on how to make herself be at the forefront of the Hollywood glitteratti. At the end of her life, she comes to terms that all the money, all the fame, all the accolades and the people fawning over her really meant nothing. She gave up the life she really wanted for fame and fortune, never really able to capture what she really needed the love of a very special person. Truly sad but showing that as the saying goes money can not buy happiness."

Everyone told me I would LOVE this book. I didn't listen. It sat and sat and sat on my shelf. This month, for whatever reason - it called to me. It was time. I read it. And.... you were all right - I FREAKIN LOVED IT! How do you even write a review that gives this book the justice it deserves? I can't, I won't. Just know that Evelyn Hugo's life was complicated, sad, beautiful and absolutely enthralling. She was a force to be reckoned with as she dealt with race, sexuality, societal norms, poverty, wealth & privilege, love and loss. This book was about so many things - so much more than I ever expected it would be. Yet, aside from all of those things I was left with the ultimate lesson that this life we live is short so we shouldn’t spend it pretending to be someone we aren’t, letting happiness slip through our fingers."

From beautiful writing to a breathtaking plot, this book stole my heart. I haven't read anything quite like this and my love for it cannot be contained in one review, but I tried anyway!…
How this book was created-
5 gallons - beautiful writing5 gallons - sapphic romance5 gallons - amazing characters5 gallons - breathtaking plot10 gallons - hopeless bookworms... Hollywood icon Evelyn Hugo is ready, to tell the truth about her life of beauty and scandals. Evelyn makes the surprising choice to have unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant tell her story. Monique is not at her best - her husband has left and her career is going nowhere. In order to tell Evelyn's story, Monique will listen to learn about Evelyn’s life from Evelyn herself. Monique has started to feel a real connection with Evelyn, but eventually, it becomes clear that Monique's life intersects with Evelyn's in a shocking and unchangeable way. Evelyn Hugo's life was in no way perfect. But it is so beautiful and raw, that I still love every detail of it. 
 ' ""OK,"" I say. ""What is it?"" Evelyn's mood tuns a bit darker. ""I'm not a good person, Monique. Make sure, in the book, that that's clear. That I'm not claiming to be good. That I did a lot of things that hurt a lot of people, and I would do them over again if I had to."" ' 
 Evelyn tells everything the way it is. She is not ashamed of who she is, nor of the things that she has done. She has experienced so much, and she is written in a way that makes so much sense for someone who has been through so much - she is someone who has learned so much through what she has been through and is finally confident to say it. Celia is hilarious and kind in all the right ways.
“And just as she was about to leave the microphone, she said 'And to anyone tempted to kiss the TV tonight, please don't chip your tooth.”
 She is so cute and funny! The entire story is told through Evelyn’s memory, and it is so clear that Celia is such an important person to Evelyn. She is the love of Evelyn Hugo’s life - this sapphic duo was so unbelievably perfect. Anytime they would get into a fight, it was so painful, and when they were broken up, I was just not emotionally okay. Harry is so wholesome. His character is just pure comfort - for the readers, and for Evelyn. He is Evelyn’s best friend, and he is such an important example of how a best friend can be more important than anything else. The Seven Husbands...🔪🔪🔪MURDER 🔪🔪🔪All of the husbands, except for one. *coughs* harryPart of me wishes this was a chaotic femme fatale story, but it is not, and that's okay.The 
Plot
*faints*We should just simply take a moment of silence, to truly appreciate this plot. *silence*To start off, the way it was written - this book takes place over a much longer period of time then most books do. And, along with that, it had a lot of details. Oftentimes, with books that have plot taking place over time, the author makes cuts like “two years later, blah blah blah…”, and this book did do that. However, ( I have no Idea how Taylor Jenkins Reid did this) but the changes just felt seamless and clean - I never felt it was annoying, or ruined the story. So, about the actual plot…
“No one is just a victim or a victor. Everyone is somewhere in between. People who go around casting themselves as one or the other are not only kidding themselves, but they’re also painfully unoriginal.”
It was so amazing to get to see one whole person’s life, even if they are fictional. One thing that I noticed, is that the book is titled “the seven husbands” as if everyone has not already noticed that, and that the book is divided into sections titled with each husband. However, in my opinion, the whole focus and meaning of the book is not really about that. However, I think that the book being titled “the seven husbands”, and it being sectioned by husband, might be a way of showing how what you see at first glance(title & sections)is very different from the real truth and feelings - just like how the media perceived Evelyn.Another one of my favorite parts of this book was the romance. 💖💖💖💜💜💜💙💙💙 It will make you emotionally unstable, and break your heart.I really can’t say a whole ton about the plot without spoiling it, so I guess I will have to leave it here. 
“You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”
And finally, a little bit about the 
The Representation
. 
“Make them pay you what they would pay a white man”
Monique is biracial, and Evelyn is Cuban! It is also pretty sad to see how Evelyn dyed her hair, and changed herself for hollywood. But it really does show how biased Hollywood can be. In addition, there was bi & lesbian rep. Which always makes me so incredibly happy…
“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary”
...All throughout this book, I continued to think about how much it reminded me of Taylor Swift songs. At first, I thought that it was just all the drama, romance, and feminism that made me feel like this book was so much like Taylor’s songs! However, as I continued reading the book, I realized that a lot of the book's deeper meaning connects back to some of the meanings of Taylor’s songs. So, I decided that I would change up the lyrics of two of my favorite Taylor Swift songs - one of them will be emotional *sobbing*, and the other one will be a bit more of a chaotic parody. Enjoy ❤️ (I have put all of the lyrics which I have left unchanged, in quotes & italics) 
State of Grace
 Some people will find my version of this song as a personal attackThis version of State of Grace, is meant to describe my feelings and experience reading this book!I had way too much fun writing this Have fun reading…

“It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.”

“Heartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.”

The Seven Husbands Of Evelyn Hugo, by Taylor Jenkins Reid was a book I was quite excited to read, tand he moment I started reading it, I knew it would be an instant favourite . Something about this book gripped me from the first page. I was so captivated while reading, and I believe this is my favorite book by Reid. 

“Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”

Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? As Monique interviews Evelyn, she begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.

“When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things.”

➼The 
plot
 of The Seven Husbands Of Evelyn Hugo is unlike anything I've read before. Its a unique concept and I was completely interested in the storyline. ➼I went into this book completely blind, so I had no idea what this was going to about, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. ➼The 
writing
 of the book was exceptional, and full of powerful and meaningful quotes. I personally wasn't a huge fan of Monique's perspective, but I loved Evelyn's POV.➼The 
characters
 are the best part of the book. They are so well written. I related to any of these characters so much. I formed an emotional connection with almost all of them. Evelyn is definitely my favourite, and Henry is my second favourite. I don't like of Celia that much, but could see where she was coming from. ➼The 
audiobook narration 
 was very good! I am glad I read it in audiobook format as it gave 'movie feels', and made the experience more enjoyable. 

“I’m bisexual. Don’t ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box.”

Overall, The Seven Husbands Of Evelyn Hugo, was an incredible book. I'd highly recommend it. 

“You have to find a job that makes your heart feel big instead of one that makes it feel small.”

282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2947323-dianne,Rating 4 out of 5,"Here's a well done late summer vacation read- this is a very entertaining and absorbing story full of old school Hollywood glamour. A reclusive screen siren in her late seventies, Evelyn Hugo, summons an unknown junior writer at Vivant magazine, Monique Grant, to write her biography. It is made clear from the start that Evelyn has some ulterior motive for selecting Monique and part of the fun is trying to puzzle that out (it won't be exactly what you think it is). The real story, though, is Evelyn's as she narrates her life story to Monique. She's an unusual character, unlikeable at times, but very frank and candid about her choices and decisions in life.Just this side of ""chick lit,"" but well done with a refreshing modern twist. I liked it. Not great literature, but a good story well told that you'll lose yourself in for a few days.Thanks to Simon and Schuster for the gift of a hardcover copy of this book - love that colorful cover!"

The plot was so interesting and I couldn't really put the book down anymore; this is definitely one of the best novels I've read this year so far and it deserves all the hype it's receiving at the moment. What's kinda scary though is that I don't think I would've picked this book up solely based on its synopsis and that I would have missed out on a book I loved if it hadn't been for all the people who told me to just read it because it's amazing. I mean, who knows how many books there are that have the potential to become some of my favorite books but that I'll never read because they just don't sound like books I'd usually enjoy reading?So I'm incredibly happy that I picked this book up even though it's very unlike what I usually read. I honestly loved ""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"" so much and it's definitely one of those books that I hope will be made into a movie one day because I think it would look great on screen. Five out of five stars to this masterpiece of a book!"
288,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle,Rating 5 out of 5,"Evelyn Hugo was once an Oscar-winning movie star who graced the gossip magazine pages for her off-screen relationships as much as her on-screen actions. She is a now a reclusive former star who still shines brightly and remains enough of an enigma to have journalists clamouring for information concerning her. Monique, despite owning little notoriety and a low-grade job, is the lucky individual chosen to deliver Evelyn's story.Evelyn Hugo had my heart from the very first moment both Monique and the reader became introduced to her. She remained a formidable presence and an elusive individual until the final pages, despite the story of her life that was slowly revealed throughout the course of the book. The author did an incredible job of crafting both this elite persona and the world of old Hollywood that she invited us into.This became a more heartfelt story than the one I was anticipating. Evelyn Hugo might have owned enviable facial features and society's 'perfect' body shape, and she might have seemed like a flirtatious and uncaring individual, with the slew of men she left in her wake, but the truth about her identity and the relationships she entered into could not be any more different than the carefully crafted image she presented to the rest of the world. Loneliness and pain were with her across every step of her journey from poor Mexican girl residing in Hell's Kitchen to blonde bombshell, seven-times divorcee, and Oscar-winning movie star, and so was I."

It was an amazing, immersive and beautiful read. .It talked about so many important topics such as diversity, sexuality, women in the workplace, lgbtq rights and so much more. .I loved every second of this book and I was so sad it ended. And it had such an amazing plot twist at the end that I did not see coming at all..Bottom line is, this book is beyond hyped. I think it’s fully worth the hype and I loved every minute of it.

293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11856352-mo,Rating 5 out of 5,"I didn't read many reviews prior to starting this one. I saw that a lot of my friends gave it 4 and 5 stars. I have read one book by this author before and was not impressed but I gathered that this one spanned a number of decades and it sounded like my cuppa tea.I grew up in the era (gosh, that makes me sound ancient) where you got your books from the library! That was it! We couldn't really afford to buy books. If you were lucky, at Christmas, you got a book. So the library was my oasis for books ... I loved those epic tales that spanned decades ... Sidney Sheldon, Dannielle Steele, Jeffrey Archer! ""The Thorn Birds"" - anyone remember that one? This book reminded me of those stories. It tells the story of Evelyn over a period of almost 70 years. 
“It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.”

“When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things.” 
It's a book you cannot really say too much about. You are better off just reading it and living the story.
“forgiveness is different from absolution.” 
A fascinating, epic tale. I literally could not put the book down!"

297,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47160872-acqua,Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5 stars.I could start this review by saying that this book didn't work for me because adult contemporary fiction just isn't my thing. I could say that this wasn't my kind of novel, since it deals with American history and Hollywood and I care about neither. I could tell you that the hype ruined it for me, the glowing five-star reviews, or the many untagged spoilers.All of those things are true. But the main reason is, I don't like reading books about queer pain.Yes, that's it. I get enough in real life. I'm glad if someone can feel empowered by a book about people suffering for being queer, some of them dying tragically when relatively young because the author likes to toe the line with tragedy porn, but I can't.Why I think The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is about queer pain:The surprising thing is, this book wouldn't have felt like that if only it had been told differently, but at the same time I can recognize this wasn't possible.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo follows Monique, a young reporter who is now writing the biography of the very mysterious actress Evelyn Hugo, famous for her seven husbands. This books covers all of Evelyn's life, which means that:• it's very fast-paced and readable, but it's also rushed;• the side characters are never developed enough;• I couldn't care about anyone but Evelyn;• I couldn't understand why Evelyn and the love of her life liked each other so muchI couldn't, because everything goes by way too fast. Almost all scenes we get of Celia and Evelyn are the plot-relevant ones, the bones of the story, which means that most of the scenes we get about them are about them fighting. And I don't mean bickering, I mean hurting each other, sometimes deliberately. I'm sure their relationship wasn't all like that, but if that is all I get, I don't have any reason to root for them. We see the conflict instead of the relationship.And all the conflict in their relationship stems from homophobia.You could say that it actually stems from Evelyn being selfish and always using people, you could say that all of it happened because of Celia's stubbornness (by the way: I couldn't stand her), but honestly? The reason Evelyn was using people was to protect herself and her love from homophobia. Celia was stubborn because she didn't know how to make this marriage work when everyone outside her found family was homophobic. Once we meet Celia, everything was about homophobia.I'm not saying books like this one shouldn't exist. I know The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo has been important for many people. I also know that I almost couldn't finish it, and I still wonder how this book managed to hurt me so much when I knew everything that was going to happen and didn't even care about the characters. I don't think this is a bad book, either: Evelyn is a very unique, well-rounded character, surprisingly complex, so manipulative she almost scared me. I really liked her, because she was awful at times, and I love when women - especially queer women of color (she's bisexual and Cuban) - are allowed to be awful without being demonized. And while I think this format of storytelling is inherently flawed, I don't think this book could have worked any other way.This book just wasn't for me. There's nothing wrong with that; I just wish I had realized this before putting myself through the second half."

 Can i hug Taylor Jenkins??? For writing this  PIECE OF HEART SHATTERING PERFECTION. *AHHH* Did this book rip my heart out??? OMG!!! YESSDid i lost my mind after reading it??? *nodding with full force*Did this book give me immense overthinking episodes???  YASS!! LAST NIGHT I ONLY SLEPT FOR 2.5 HOURS *not exaggerating, i was thinking about this book for hours* Seven Husbands Of Evelyn Hugo is LEGIT A MASTERPIECE (if you don't agree with it go argue with a wall). I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK i just don't want to get over it, the reason why i love this piece of art is because in this book there's no victor or victim, everyone is flawed and did awful things in their lives, the rawness of the characters made this book so real and it explains so well that not a single human is perfect. This book is so realistic and still a fiction (I MEAN HOW COULD THIS BOOK CAN BE UNREAL, I WANT A REAL EVELYN, CELIA AND HARRY CAMERON PLIS) How will i ever recover from this book???? ""I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.""*i worship this quote* Evelyn Hugo is such a powerful character a one could ever read, i highkey admire how she is determined and passionate to succeed no matter how many huddles/barriers are thrown at her, how she always keeps her head high no matter how much people put her down was inspirational. I know she did some awful things but thats what make us humans (flawed and imperfect). ""People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy."" *OH LORD* I love how Taylor Jenkin covered such sensitive topics (racism, sexualities, alcoholism, domestic abuse, suicide, LGBTQ+ rights) *SHE DID SUCH A PERFECT JOB* The writing was impeccably poetic and so DAMN GOOD AND UNIQUE. *screams* OMG!! The setting, plot, characters, story descriptions were so beautifully written *chef's literal literal kiss* (yeah i purposely wrote two literals) *I PLEA YOU TO READ THIS BOOK* like  drop everything and read this gorgeous baby* ""It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.""   Happy Reading!!<"
299,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107158418-clara,Rating 5 out of 5,"Cuando empecé a leer este libro, pense: ""No hay forma de que puedan hacer que me parezca creible que alguien se casara siete veces"", que equivocada estaba.Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo es una historia sumamente realista, con un personaje principal que, como se dice varias veces, no es bueno, ni malo, simplemente es ambas.Los personajes son muy buenos, desde Celia, la cual debe convivir con el hecho de que sus dos deseos mas grandes nunca seran compatibles: triunfar como actriz y amar libremente. Luego tenemos a Harry, mi favorito, quien se convierte en el mejor amigo, confidente y familia de Evelyn. Harry es alguien muy querible, una gran persona que tampoco puede ser quien es gracias a la mie*da de sociedad de ese entonces. Por ultimo, tenemos a Evelyn Hugo, en cuya vida sufrio mucho, pero tambien amo, fue amada y fue feliz. Creo que todos los personajes son sumamente realistas. Me encantó la forma de narrar de la autora, te lleva de un marido a otro y vos, como lector, crees que verdaderamente estas leyendo una biografia. Muchas veces llegue a pensar que Evelyn Hugo habia existido y queria ver sus peliculas, verla en las alfombras rojas...Sin duda fue muy adictivo y, al no ser un género que acostumbre leer, novedoso.El único problema que le veo es todo el hype que tiene. Es ESPECTACULAR, pero estoy segura de que si uno comienza a leer sin tenerle taaantas expectativas, lo amaria.Cuando leia, estaba buscando ese libro que todos aman, y eso no fue favorable.Igualmente, hay una clara razon de que sea tan popular, vale la pena 100%.Lo recomiendo muchisimo☆☆☆☆☆"

I recently read Daisy Jones and gave it a 5-star rating, loving it so much that I was determined to read this book in the first quarter of 2020 and I'm so glad I did! This book was so much more than a story about an actress that had seven husbands, it was a love story told over decades, and an LGBTQ one at that! didn't see that one coming, and it made it so much more enjoyable for me, being a gay man myself. This story crushed my heart so many times that in good conscience I couldn't give it anything less than five stars. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a phenomenal writer and may very well go on my auto-buy list! 2 books down both garnering five stars, I may very well go back and read all of her previous novels if they are this good. I would recommend this book to a variety of genre fans. it's definitely not one you want to miss out on! Shame on me for waiting so long to give this one a read!"

A character born in 1938 who supposedly uses phrases like ""your truth"" (not buying it). Unrealistic dialogue. A story that's basically an agenda for hot-button issues. Not to mention that the characters never came alive.Don't believe the hype. Read Movie Star By Lizzie Pepper (by Hilary Liftin) for your celebrity gossip fix instead.I am so tired of book marketing these days.

Evelyn's life story was undeniably captivating, the cast interesting and diverse. But although I liked the idea of the characters, they all felt strangely flat to me. Maybe it had to do with the writing, which was too detached for my taste, or with the fact that none of the heavy moments were allowed to linger, the heartbreak they brought described within a few sentences and then all but forgotten. And this is a nitpick, but oh my god, the constant descriptions of what everyone was wearing were wearing me down lol, it wasn't even subtly woven into the plot or anything, just constant statements like: I was wearing a green cocktail dress, high heels, a sombrero, and a diamond necklace. Celia was wearing a white pantsuit, crocs and Groucho Marx glasses.Admittedly they were probably never described as being dressed like my little brother's Animal Crossing characters, but they might as well have been, considering how hard I zoned out after the 150th wardrobe description.All in all a good book with a simple but nice message."

I love how the author portrayed Evelyn, showing all of her flaws and ""sins"", but also making us understand why she did what she did. I, personally, did not hate her for anything that she did, actually I loved her even more as I understood her. I love Monique's involvement in Evelyn's story and I love the fact that she got to figure out some of her own shit while listening to it. The only reason I won't give this book 5 stars is because I kind of predicted the ending (this actually happens a lot to me idk why :) ). Either way, I would totally recommend this book.4.5 stars"

307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114890661-martina,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 ⭐Questo libro mi ha lasciata senza parole. Il personaggio di Evelyn Hugo è veramente spettacolare, ha una personalità complessa ma è sempre rimasta fedele a sé stessa in qualsiasi circostanza.Attraverso le pagine di questo libro marito dopo marito si è delineata una figura complessa che provoca ammirazione e disprezzo insieme. In Evelyn Hugo è presente questo forte dualismo che è mi ha lasciata interdetta fino alla fine.All'inizio trovavo le scene con Monique solo un futile contorno alla strabiliante storia di Evelyn e invece, alla fine, si scoprono dei risvolti che mi hanno sì scioccata ma mi sembra che si stato trattato solo superficialmente. La figura di Monique è poco delineata e rimane piatto per metà della storia ma sempre verso la fine ha il ""momento di gloria"".Il libro è quasi interamente scritto al passato e la storia di Evelyn è scandita dai suoi matrimonio e dalle sue pene d'amore, ha uno stile che mi ha catturato man mano che andavo avanti nella lettura anche se all'inizio mi sembrava un po' scialbo e noioso.Non voglio aggiungere altro perché questo libro, che rientri nel vostro gusto personale o meno, è ben scritto e per quanto mi riguarda merita un'occasione.Sarei molto curiosa di vedere una trasposizione cinematografica di questo libro perché la merita sinceramente."

It’s with one word a MASTERPIECE!!!I don’t think it’s necessary for me to talk about the inner workings of this book. Just let me tell you, that Evelyn Hugo is one of the most intriguing and fascinating characters I’ve read this year.Strong, ruthless, beautiful, and loving. She deserved an Oscar for her performance.Her life was incredibly fascinating. And each husband brought her closer to her ultimate goal.I honestly didn’t know what the book was about when I picked it up. I had no idea where it was going, and that alone, this uniquely different portrait of a Hollywood bombshell, made this book so much more unforgettable.It was emotional, heart-breaking at times, touching, and never less than amazing.I know that I’ll be reading everything this author is releasing from here on out. I’m hooked. Two 5 star books in one year by the same author is all the proof I need.BRAVO!!!"

310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76865822-dani,Rating 1 out of 5,"EDIT: Author is a zionist that's why this book is 🗑️I liked it but I think it's was too short and a bit rushed towards the end. I think there wasn't enough exploration of the characters past except for monique and evelyn. Couldn't really care about any of the characters deeply because you don't get to know them outside of their involvement in Evelyn's life especially her daughter. I thought towards the end it was going to be revealed that Connor severely resented Evelyn because, from what you read, it seems like Evelyn was very uninvolved in raising her. Idk it just took me out of the story a bit. It was too much a suspension of disbelief that Connor almost just peacefully accepted everything that was going on in her moms life. I would still be shocked if my mother told me that she's in love with someone you've always known as a family friend. It's a lot to take in, you'd have to re-contextualize a lot of your memories. I also didn't enjoy the white author trying to parrot race and diaspora discourse into her characters, it was written very shallow and again just a copy and paste of what the author has most definitely read in other better books written by actual authors of color. I also felt really bad for Luisa, she gave decades of her life to take care of Evelyn AND Connor; a child that wasn't hers. Anytime Luisa was mentioned I was way more interested in knowing more about her world. How much time did she give up with her own family (did she even have children?) to clean up after Evelyn's messes and a baby she didn't bring into the world? It made me resent and dislike Evelyn even though I know it wasn't the authors intention."
311,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50603889-tammy,Rating 4 out of 5,"I began reading The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo assuming that it would be a fictional, gossipy tell-all about a movie star's life from the 50's onward. In other words a light book to begin while traveling. Read on one level, it is. Evelyn is part Marilyn Monroe, part Elizabeth Taylor, part Bette Davis and she does marry seven times but not for reasons you might think. Evelyn's scandalous life story is a hot property and she chooses to tell it to an unlikely reporter. Sounds juicy to me.Read on another level, this book confronts many social and women's issues that are, unfortunately, still true today. I don't want to give away too much so suffice it to say that I was impressed and pleased that The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was much, much more than I had anticipated. By the way, my three hour flight felt like it took three minutes."

It was such a rollercoaster of emotions that made me cry plenty of times. BEST BOOK I’VE READ. HANDS DOWN. I’m not trusting anyone who would rate this below 4 stars. This book would forever be in my heart <3

316,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64075211-ellie,Rating 5 out of 5,"[reread May 2020 bc this book is just so eternally good]I'm coming to find that with this book, and with every reread, I will come to relate even more deeply with Evelyn Hugo depending on the point I am in my life. Whether it's her fierce ambition to get ahead, her position as a bisexual woman, or her listening to her brain rather than her heart. Because of it, it makes me think a lot more deeply about what I want from myself and my life too.What I also enjoy about TSOEH is how romantic it is, but how it is the jagged, raw, realistic romance. In books, all too often the love interests are charming and witty and attractive, and their flaws are a little glossed over. Not so here. Evelyn and Celia are incredible, but the book is also honest with how they have hurt each other. Evelyn prioritised her work over Celia; Celia questioned Evelyn's ability as an actress and criticised her string of marriages. Both are ambitious women, and I admire them both incredibly. Throughout the narrative they both develop as characters, fixing past mistakes with newer actions. To me, that lends a depth of realism and credibility that serves to make this entire book even more genuine, and their relationship even more meaningful. There is little doubt that TSEOH remains deserving of a full five stars and a position as one of my lifetime favourites. **[first read, December 2018]OKAY, THANKS FOR ATTACKING ME LIKE THAT, BOOK. // I had heard prior praise, but I didn’t expect my heart to be shredded and chewed up and spit out savagely and I am just so so sooo in love - At first glance, The Seven Husbands Of Evelyn Hugo looks to be a chick-flick-y, slightly scandalous heterosexual romance novel about an actress and her many husbands - and then it drops a load on you, laughs, and reveals itself to be an unashamedly queer novel with a proud bisexual and Cuban actress heroine, and centres on her love for another woman. Besides being f/f, it discusses the problems of being homosexual from the 1950s onward, and how destructive for your life and career it could be if you were seen in a same-sex relationship or even known to be lgbtq+. It is also proudly feminist, with Evelyn Hugo adopting a post-feminist stance on her sexuality and the use of her body. It covers a few other topics too - how bisexuality is often challenged as being not a “real” sexuality (the argument people often bringing up being that you’re either straight or you’re gay/lesbian, there is no middle ground); the obstacles society places in front of those who are biracial; and the Hollywood whitewashing when it comes to actresses who have names that aren’t white/don’t look white. There’s a lot of themes throughout this novel that are mediated upon, and it’s all very thought-provoking.I read this over the course of one day - that’s how invested I was. Every time I went to put it down, I came back to pick it up moments later. It was easily-read and addicting, filled with beauty and tragedy and hope and heartbreak. At the end I had been crying on and off for a good 50 pages. And the final twist! I didn’t see it coming. I knew there had to be some kind of relation between Evelyn and Monique, the journalist interviewing her, but the reveal was so shockingly devastating and incredibly well-done. And the characters are so well-realised: loveable, admirable, and also deeply flawed like all humans are. This book builds on you. At first it was a solid 4 stars, then as it went on it was a 4.5, and then by the end there was no other rating for it, in my eyes, than a full 5 stars. Because it Went There and Did That, and wrapped it all up in a beautiful package. And now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to recommend this to everyone I know."

To visit new places, experience adventures, learn from their mistakes, and let those pieces play a small part in shaping the way you navigate your own life. This book tells the life story of Evelyn Hugo, a story of glamour, betrayal, vanity, love, soul mates (that come in many different forms) and, yes, 7 husbands. I had heard so much hype about this book, and Taylor Jenkins Reid in general, and it didn’t take me long to understand the adoration people have for this book. It truly played out like a movie in my head, and was to blame for some not-so-cute tears at the end. I had such a good time deep diving into this complicated, unapologetic woman.“No one is a victim or a victor. Everyone is somewhere in between. People who go around casting themselves as one or the other are not only kidding themselves, but they’re also painfully unoriginal.”"
319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82763676-piyush-bhatia,Rating 5 out of 5,"It's always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, and how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving others ruthlessly. The climax of the book is excellent for a twist, is heartbreaking, and yet so beautiful. An enthralling read about glamour and love and an incisive critique of what it means to have stardom and the price for fame. It explores the themes of love, loyalty, betrayal, LGBT, etc., and has the ability to keep the reader involved at all times. All in all, a spellbinding read!An adaptation is on the cards and I'm sure most of the readers would be avidly looking forward to it...Captivating and swooning. The climax is exciting and the closure is comforting!4.5 stars rounded to 5"
320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39575951-helen-2-0,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars. Evelyn Hugo is ambitious, audacious, and unapologetic. What more can I ask of a female protagonist? I definitely connected more with Evelyn’s story than the present timeline chapters, which IMO could have been removed from the book entirely and the story would still have been a success. Cw for death of family members, suicide, substance abuse, mentions of dubcon…and (obviously) tons of divorce. "

But I was soon swept away. I love golden era Hollywood and this book spoke to my obsession with that era and the starlets of the time. Everything spoke to me and I couldn't have been more in love!

""It is because I have been falling in love with you for decades. The camera sees you as I see you. And when that happens, you soar."" 

❤️ What I Loved ❤️Evelyn: Evelyn was an amazing character! At first I found her hard to like, but she slowly won me over. I loved how strong she was, how willful. And I especially loved how unapologetic she was. She was candid about her emotions, her desires and her flaws. She didn't try to make herself out to be any better than what she was. She was honest about all parts of herself, even the ones others would fault her for. That spoke volumes to me.Characters: There were so many characters to grow fond of. The best part about all of them was how flawed they were. No one was perfect. No one was special. They all had goodness as well as faults. That made them all the more likable to me. I especially grew fond of Harry. We should all be so lucky to have a Harry in our lives.Hollywood: I have loved golden era Hollywood since I first time saw Singin' in the Rain. From there my love and fascination only grew. I have devoured movies and biographies. But never before have I found a fiction novel, that gave me the same pleasure, the same indulgence. This one did. And I loved it!Emotions: I was so tangled up in this story, the characters and the plot. So many emotions coursed through me and I am not ashamed to say that I ugly cried more than once.Follow me for more book loving content!Blog ✨ Facebook ✨ Instagram ✨ Twitter Blog Post: 10 Criminally Underrated YA Books with an LGBTQ Twist"
324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1594906-kim,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. I did not see this coming. At all. Most of the time, while reading this book, I was thinking about how much I liked the story, but I wasn't feeling the same thing everybody else seemed to feel while reading this. It was almost like I was missing something. I enjoyed it, but I wasn't blown away by it.And then I got near the end and I don't think a book has ever made me cry this hard. I cried like I lost a dear friend.This book really lives up to the hype. And if you are going to read this, and maybe feel like I did because you don't see what that big fuss is about (yet), then just keep on going. This book is heartbreaking, amazing, ugly, horrible and beautiful. Kind of like life itself.----------Yeah, watch me jump on that bandwagon!"

329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106719992-pelumi,Rating 4 out of 5,"OUT OF FIVERATING: 3.5PLOT: 3.5CHARACTERS: 4ROMANCE:3This book was a bit disappointing, the keyword here being ""a bit""There's so much hype for this book and honestly, its not so hard to see why. However, the thing is, there were some aspects that didn't really do it for me. When I read this, I was really not in a good mood so take this review with a grain of salt.Are the characters great? YES, they're well made. Evelyn is such a complex character with complex emotions, she's one of those characters that you either love for her defiance or hate for her bad choices or maybe just feel indifferent about because you couldn't care any less whatever the fuck she decides to do with her life. I'm the indifferent one here.“When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things.”A character of note that I'd love to mention is HARRY CAMERON! He is the sweetest person ever and his relationship, platonic of course with Evelyn was honestly one of my favorite aspects of the whole book. I love how they had each other's backs and honestly, its so wholesome ugh.  It was written in a biography style with general detailing of every single one of her seven husbands. An alternative title would be The seven husbands of Evelyn hugo and the one love of her life because that's basically the plot. Seven husbands, some good, some downright terrible and some they got together for contract purposes. Yet, she emerged as a great movie star, a great mom and a wife. Throughout the book, various mentions were made about her one wife whom she truly loved that no one knew about.“It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.” Evelyn has seen abuse, she's been exploited, she has seen good times and ugly times and she has done things, most of which she would do again if she had to go back. She's rich, defiant, isn't afraid to do what she has to do to get what she want and fucking bad ass but even then my opinion of her was just eh.I do like one thing about her though, she's so fucking real!“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.” The writing style was unique and lovely It made it quite easy to follow the story. Written by Monique, we get to see things from both their point of views. There's something else that makes the plot interesting. Why did she choose underconfident, introverted and recently divorced Monique?? Don't ask me, I ain't giving out spoilers.“I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.”The plot was definitely good and the pacing...righteous!. It wasn't too slow or too fast. It was just right and then, the plot twist at the end?? I didn't see it coming in a million years and for that I'd like to applaud the author.However, there were a few things I didn't enjoyCecilia and Evelyn's relationship: Am I the only one that felt it was toxic at times??They had chemistry no doubt but the way they kept on breaking each other, over and over again. It made me so frustrated that they'll ignore the basic things that make up a healthy relationship. I'll still mention that at that age and time, it was fitting. However, it doesn't mean I have to like it!I would point out that it got progressively better as they grew older and so it has development. The supposed ""emotional"" ending: Was I surprised by the turn of events?? Yes! Did I like the ending?? Not really.I felt hollow when the book ended not because of any emotion whatsoever but because I was expecting more! I just ended so abruptly that I didn't even feel anything. I wasn't sad, no tears. I just felt a whole bunch of nothing and that's the basic reason why I'm giving it this rating. Maybe its just my mood but I didn't like it that much.The way their races were represented felt a bit awkward It was like the author was shoving it in my face. Here, Evelyn is Cuban. A latina!!!Here, Monique(the writer) is biracial!!no development whatsoever or unfolding this by using the usual racial prejudice expected in the time frame.But the author is white so it might be unrealistic if she wrote it like that, but still, it doesn't mean I have to like it!As my BR partner rightly puts it, ""I don't want to judge it so early on, but so far I wish there was more tie ins to both protagonist's background. Because when white authors do this it feels like its just for diversity points without actually doing the research. And I feel like TJR choosing racially ambiguous characters was a cop out instead of actually getting informed enough to write an unambiguous black & Latina character. And it was so awkwardly inserted in the first few paragraphs that both characters are they races that they are. Like it wasn't gradually indicated through character building sentiments. Just very random and blatant.""Apart from the few complaints, the book was good. Not the best thing but it could be worse and it could be better.Pre read thoughtsFinally reading this!!!!!!!!Also buddy read with Dasani<3Edit: I've come to the conclusion that there's something ultimately wrong with me. I didn't really like this as much as I thought I would. I felt no emotion...it could just be me being bitchy because I'm not on my best moods but I did laugh at some parts and get angry at some parts so yay for that. Albeit, I expected more from this . Not a fan of Evelyn or Cecilia but i did like this a bit so 3.5 stars.Full RTC (i hope my lazy ass gets to it eventually)"
