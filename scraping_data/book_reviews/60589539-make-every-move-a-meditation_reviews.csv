By using movement that you are already doing (sports, walking, etc.), it can be easier to add meditation into your life.As a 200-hour yoga teacher, I have read many books about meditation. Many of them were dry, giving the history of meditation, and written for those that already meditate (don’t get me wrong, there is value in these books). Nita Sweeney writes for both new meditators and new to movement meditators.She begins by explaining why you should implement movement into your meditation. There is great value in both movement and meditation. By putting them together, you can reap bigger rewards – just read the book to find out!What I really liked about the book were the actionable steps. Nita not only explains how to use movement for meditation she gives instructions to practice before moving on.Writing for the world of self-indulgence and sharing personal stories makes this one of the most captivating meditation books that I have read."
1,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love to run and enjoy the benefits of meditation, but until I picked up this insightful book, I had never tried combining the two. Nita’s humble and often humorous accounts make this a relatable read packed with great tips for bringing new awareness to any movement form. What struck me was her deep knowledge of meditation, which is reflected in the many stories, sources, and references she has gained through her years of practice. This is one of those books where the learnings will last a lifetime. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get more from meditation, exercise, and life."

The Buddhism aspect is cool too as it gives insight too and a backbone to meditation.
