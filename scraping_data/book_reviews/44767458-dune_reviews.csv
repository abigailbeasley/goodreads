0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4686064-rajat-ubhaykar,Rating 5 out of 5,"In my head, the purpose of this review is very clear. It is to convince YOU to read this book. Yes, you! Waste time no more. Go grab a copy.Machiavellian intrigue, mythology, religion, politics, imperialism, environmentalism, the nature of power. All this set in a mind-boggling, frighteningly original world which Herbert ominously terms as an ""effort at prediction"". Dune had me hooked!First impressionThe very first stirring I felt upon opening the yellowed pages of Dune was that of stumbling upon an English translation of an ancient Arabic manuscript of undeniable power and potence which had an epic story to narrate. The tone was umistakably sombre and I realized Herbert was not here to merely entertain me, he was here to make me part of the legend of Muad'Dib. It was intriguing and challenging and heck, since I live for challenges I decided to take this one up too, gladly. The challenge was the complexity and depth of the plot, which left me perplexed, in the beginning. I knew there were dialogues which meant much more than their superficial meaning and was unable to grasp at it. I felt a yawning chasm between Herbert's vision and my limited understanding of it. However, of course, I plodded on and could feel the gap closing in with every page much to my joy and relief. The Foreword""To the people whose labours go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'- to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration."" The foreword makes it pretty clear that Frank Herbert isn't kidding around. This is a serious effort at predicting how our world is going to look two thousand years from now and by God, it's a bloody good and detailed prediction. However, the real merit in this effort lies in the commentary on our lives in the present.Why Frank Herbert is a geniusThe setting of the book is arid futuristic. the plot is driven by political mind games reminiscent of The Game of Thrones. The issues he tackles are as modern as the colour television. Herbert's genius manifests itself in his ability to combine the past, the present and the future in one sweeping elegant move called Dune.Plot and SettingDune is set in a futuristic technologically advanced world which after the Butlerian Jihad (the bloody war between Man and Machines) has eliminated all computers and passed a decree declaring ""Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind"". Since there are no computers, the essential working of the galaxy is still medieval and feudal with heavy reliance on men and their dallying around. Lots of thriller potential right there. Men with superhuman analytical abilities called Mentats have taken the place of Computers. On the other hand, we have the Bene Gesserit, an ancient school of mental and physical training for female students (it gives them superhuman intuitive powers) who follow a selective breeding program which makes them feared and mistrusted through the Imperium. Their desired end product of this breeding program is the Kwisatz Haderach, a superman who’ll be able to glimpse into the future. How he’ll be able to do this is rooted in Herbert’s idea of determinism: given that one can observe everything and analyze everything, one can effectively glimpse the future in probabilistic terms. Quantum physics anyone? The Kwisatz Haderach is the proposed solution to the male-female dichotomy, between the analytical and intuitive.The plot of Dune is almost wholly set on the desert planet of Arrakis (also referred to as Dune), an arid wasteland where water is so scarce that men have to wear stillsuits which recycle human moisture for further consumption. The source of the galaxy’s interest in the planet is Melange, a spice which bestows upon one longevity and prescient powers. Everything on the planet is permeated with the spice, the air, the sand, the food. Everybody on the planet is hopelessly addicted to the spice, their only hope for survival being their continued intake of the spice. The Spacing Guild, the economic and trading monopolistic arm of the Galaxy badly needs the spice for interstellar transport. This is because their frigates travel faster than the speed of light and hence travel backward in time. The spice is the only way they can look into the future and see their way ahead. How cool is that! All the powers on the Galaxy are out to mine the spice, braving the sandworms, their name merely an euphemism, for they are gigantic 200 metre long creatures which always come digging through the sand whenever spice mining is undertook. Always. There’s also another little glitch. There exist on the planet, the kickass native desert tribal Fremen, whom the foreign powers look down with suspicion and disdain. The Fremen ethos is one of survival and scarcity, driven by tribalism and egalitarianism. Okay, I’ll stop right there. No more spoilers about this. Except that they value water to the extent that spitting on a person is the highest honour they can bestow upon him.Our protagonists are the Atreides family, consisting of the Duke, his Bene Gesserit concubine Jessica and their son Paul, who have been entrusted the stewardship of Arrakis. We discover the alien planet of Arrakis along with them, firstly with fear, suspicion and wonder and ultimately, love and respect. Paul Muad’Dib, however is no ordinary prince. There’s a teeny weeny chance he might be the Kwisatz Haderach, something which troubles him constantly and gives us our conflicted hero. The poor chap trips balls over the spice and has visions of black hordes pillaging and murdering around town bearing his flag and sees his dead body multiple times.My favourite character, however has to be the Baron Vladmir Harkonnen, the most evil character I’ve ever come across in my literary excursions. He is ruddy ruthlessness, he is virile villainy, he is truculent treachery. He executes the inept chess players in his employ which says oodles about his badassery and his fondness for cold-blooded logic. He sees everything in simplistic chess terms. What is my best move? What is my opponent’s best move? Is there anything I can do to completely squash his move? Is there a tactic which leads to mate in three? ThemesIn this setting, Herbert does so much, it’s unbelievable. Religion, politics, the dynamic nature of power, the effects of colonialism, our blatant destruction of our environment are themes which run parallel to the intensely exciting and labyrinthine plot. He shows the paramount importance of myth making and religion for power to sustain over long periods of time. Man, as a political animal is laid completely bare.Real lifeNow these are my thoughts about what Herbert could have meant to be Arrakis- It makes perfect sense. Herbert draws heavy inspiration for the religious ideology of Muad’Dib from Islam. He says “When religion and politics ride in the same cart and that cart is driven by a living Holy man, nothing can stand in the path of such a people.” which is the philosphy of the politics of Islam. Islamism in a nutshell. The spice, much desired by everyone, is the oil. Baron Vladmir Harkonnen is symblomatic of the wily Russians. The Desert foxes Fremen are representative of the native Saudi desert-dwelling Bedouin tribe who have a strongly tribe-oriented culture and undoubtedly value water in equal measure. And the ultimate loser is the environment.Why do good books get over?I almost forget this is a science fiction novel, it’s that real. It is also scary and prophetic. It is a reading experience that will leave you dreaming of the grave emptiness of Arrakis and make you wish you were there to brave it all in the privileged company of the noble Fremen. Frank Herbert achieves the pinnacle of what a sci-fi author aspires to rise to; authentic world building."

You can see all of the art online but look at this cover! Now I have this and Little Women I actually got from their site. I need to get more as I can 😬✅Reread 2022 to try to complete series! (I need to get the awesome audio too) 4.5 Stars LOOK DAMN IT! OMG!Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾••••••••••••••••I was so worried that I wouldn't understand a thing in this book. I will admit there are some things that went over my head but for the most part I figured it out. I remember a billion and 65 years ago I watched the movie and was like what the? Basically all I remember is Sting and sandworms. I would love to watch it again and see if I understand it more after reading the book. I'm still not sure what all the spices were about on Arrakis. I keep thinking it's like their farming like we would farm corn or tobacco, etc. I could be wrong and I didn't get the connection between the spice and the sandworms. Is it like a drug to them? I did read in the back of the book that is was like a drug when taken in small quantities and really addictive when taken in large quantities and that Muad'Did felt his prophesies were because of the spice. I liked Duke Leto and I hated that he was betrayed not long after they got to Arrakis. There is always some twat out there causing trouble. I really enjoyed Paul's character and his mother Jessica. They seemed like really strong people and adapted very well in everything they were put through. I didn't really pay too much attention to the other characters or I guess I should say I didn't have many thoughts about them. With the exception of the ones that betrayed them. I really enjoyed when Paul and Jessica had to travel to get away from the evil Baron Harkonnen before they were killed too. I don't know why, but I enjoyed their little journey. I think they were both great in their roles when they were found by the Freman and showed they were a force to be reckoned with. Now maybe I'm getting this all wrong but I'm trying to tell it through the way I saw it in my mind. I don't understand how Paul's sister, Alia, was an abomination. That one must have went over my head too. It might have had something to do with the poison Jessica took to become the Reverend Mother. I'm not sure but I know some of my goodreads friends that read this will get me sorted out =)Other than the sandworms and traitorous people on Arrakis, I was most freaked out by the thought of the water issue! I would NOT was to live somewhere there was a water shortage. And the part where they were talking about selling foot water, I can't even. Which basically means your stinky foot sweat! Anyhoo, I really loved the book! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾✅Thank you for the answers in my comments! 😊MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 2 out of 5,"Let me start by first apologizing to everyone who loves this classic. I don't doubt Dune was something special when it first came out in the 1960s. But reading it for the first time today, it feels horribly outdated to me and at times almost incomprehensible.I was warned going into this story that the beginning is extremely hard to understand, but that is an understatement. I could barely follow its scene after scene of dialogue referencing people and places and events, all with no explanation or context. It literally feels like I was just dropped into the middle of a book, and everything had already been explained elsewhere.But it gets better, right? Well, only somewhat. A narrative does take shape, but the writing style remains confusing and obscure. It manages to be both long-winded and not clear enough, if you can believe that. Certain obvious points are harped on again and again, but other crucial ones are merely glossed over. Then, when you inevitably miss those important points, they create this cascading effect that keeps you mired in confusion.The writing is also pretentious, with regular or nonsensical things consistently being presented in a profound way. There are plenty of extraneous paragraphs that sound good until you try to discern their meaning, at which point you'd be stumped. This sort of writing really confused me because I couldn't figure out which paragraphs mattered and needed to be dissected carefully to suss out their hidden meaning, and which ones are just adornment.As for the story itself, it was a complete mismatch with my interests. I like science fiction with lots of real science. Instead, this is a space opera (a.k.a. a soap opera that takes place in space) with no actual science. It's all political intrigue, melodrama, doublespeak, and who has power over who, which I have zero interest in. I also couldn't care less about how fawningly amazing Paul is and how he is destined to be the chosen one.This was such a frustrating reading experience because it could've been an amazing story. And there were moments in the beginning when I thought it was going in those creative directions. I was riveted during that infamous test in the first scene, only to realize that it was completely irrelevant to the rest of the story. Or to see where the book could take the scientific aspects of a desert planet and a population with so little water, which it didn't other than a bit of lip service.But the book stubbornly chose to disregard these more interesting avenues, and instead took the most straightforward, boring route of making this into a story about power struggle. Well, we could've saved ourselves the bother and just stayed on Earth for that.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧ Connect with me ✧ Instagram ✧"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,Rating 5 out of 5,"Dune.No other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well. Like a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination.This is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners.Brilliant.***2015 reread - Read years later, this has lost none of its narrative power, if anything I can better appreciate the virtuoso attention to detail Herbert exhibited in his epic creation. From the perspective of having read his later 5 Dune sequels, I am astounded at the rich tapestry he has woven. Most impressive was his close omnipresence, analyzing the thoughts and minute actions and subtle nuances of his complicated dynamic interplay of characters. The exhaustive training of the Bene Gesserit and the intricate relations of the Houses and the Guild would stand as a monumental benchmark for speculative fiction ever since.This time around I found myself looking more closely at the Harkonnens and will likely read some of Brian Herbert's additions to his fathers great work.***2019 reread - I'm even more in love with this book and am again in awe of Herbert's narrative skill. This time around I noticed that all of the quotes that begin chapters are from Princess Irulan and I paid close attention to how Herbert crafted these interludes.I also was drawn to the religious undertones that really began very early in the book and how Paul realized his gifts and was preparing for his role in the beginning chapters - all demonstrating Herbert's great narrative skill.Finally, I became more aware of what a great character was Gurney Halleck. While the ghola of Duncan Idaho dominated the later books, Herbert's creation of Halleck was an enjoyable and thought provoking addition to this masterpiece. "
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny,Rating 4 out of 5,"There's a characteristically witty essay by Borges about a man who rewrites Don Quixote, many centuries after Cervantes. He publishes a novel with the same title, containing the same words in the same order. But, as Borges shows you, the different cultural context means it's a completely new book! What was once trite and commonplace is now daring and new, and vice versa. It just happens to look like Cervantes's masterpiece.Similarly, imagine the man who was brave or stupid enough to rewrite Dune in the early 21st century. Like many people who grew up in the 60s and 70s, I read the book in my early teens. What an amazing story! Those kick-ass Fremen! All those cool, weird-sounding names and expressions they use! (They even have a useful glossary in the back). The disgusting, corrupt, slimy Harkonnens - don't you just love to hate them! When former-aristo-turned-desert-guerilla-fighter Paul Muad'Dib rides in on a sandworm at the end to fight the evil Baron and his vicious, cruel nephew, of course you're cheering for him. Who the hell wouldn't be?So that was the Dune we know and love, but the man who rewrote it now would get a rather different reception. Oh my God! These Fremen, who obviously speak Arabic, live on a desert planet which supplies the Universe with melange, a commodity essential to the Galactic economy, and in particular to transport. Not a very subtle way to say ""oil""! They are tough, uncompromising fighters, who are quite happy to use suicide bombing as a tactic. They're led by a charismatic former rich kid (OK, we get who you mean), who inspires them to rise up against the corrupt, degenerate... um, does he mean Westerners? Or only the US? And who is Baron Harkonnen intended to be? I'm racking my brains... Dubya doesn't quite seem to fit, but surely he means someone? Unless, of course, he's just a generic stereotype who stands for the immoral, sexually obsessed West. This is frightening. What did we do to make Frank al-Herbert hate us so much? You'd have people, not even necessarily right-wingers, appearing on TV to say that the book was dangerous, and should be banned: at the very least, it incites racial hatred, and openly encourages terrorism. But translations would sell brilliantly in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and a bad movie version would soon be made in Turkey.I honestly don't think Herbert meant any of that; but today, it's almost impossible not to wonder. If anyone reading this review is planning to rewrite The Tale of Benjamin Bunny, you'd better make sure you get your timing right. Who knows how it will be interpreted five years from now?"
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell,Rating 2 out of 5,"No one should argue the importance Dune. It laid the foundations for a great deal of the themes and constructs in modern science fiction. Frank Herbert was as important to the genre as Isaac Asimov and Arthur Clarke. Unfortunately, just like them, he's quite dated, and his books can be a labor to read. One thing he maintained from old science fiction was prim and scientific dialogue that no one would ever actually speak. I've known many scientists, and they don't talk like this. You're not going to convince me a child does.The stuffy dialogue is inserted into even stuffier narrative, until it feels like nothing is organic about Herbert's prose. This is a terrible tragedy when you've got a world that he put so much effort into building - and it is an amazing feat of world-building, technically interplanetary building. But unlike J.R.R. Tolkien, who he is so frequently compared to, Herbert didn't make sure to include a great story in his world. Instead he included a story that frequently illustrated how clunky an artificial world can be, even if it's lovingly crafted. I struggled to attach or find interest in anyone, yet they're more archetypes than human beings, whose logic races past modern skepticism and whose dialogue is cloyingly artificial, the way people cared for the Hobbits, Dwarves and Rangers. In his world-building, Tolkien at least saved himself from being dated by antedating himself, and even with his illuminated prose, wrought more characteristics in just one protagonist than all of Dune's cast. Even the political intrigue Herbert tries to fall back on was overdone in the Spy genre decades before he started this book. All fans of the ""Genre"" genres should appreciate Herbert's massive contributions, but they shouldn't pretend to enjoy the books if they don't, and they should be wary of certain pitfalls typical of science fiction that survived into his landmark work."

First, the book is incredibly put together and really well thought out. Often, the author wrote the book in such a way as you can hear the character's thoughts which was a really interesting perspective and provided a more immersive experience.The book touches on so many different deep topics and is so inspiring, moving.

Sorry I don't get it.I was able to finish it by listening to the audiobook but I was bored throughout the whole 21h.So many descriptions... anyone else found the way Paul's mom describing him kinda weird?And let's not even mention how many times I laughed at the main female character being called Jessica.I'm sure I'll get plenty of comments telling me it's a classic and it brought so much to the genre...

8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91520258-jack-edwards,Rating 2 out of 5,"While the cultural impact of this book is indisputable, I couldn't help feeling incredibly underwhelmed when reading it. Even the plot couldn't save Dune, since it's spoiled at every juncture by 'Princess Irulan' and her epigraphs before each chapter. Did no-one tell her about spoiler alerts?From the very first pages, this book plunges you in at the deep-end with an absurd amount of overly complex world-building, which just makes the book laborious to work through. It wasn't for me, and the post-Dune reading slump is real."

Sure, it might be a bit too soon for her, but she DID insist because we'll be seeing Dune part 2 later this year. And she happens to know that I'm a rabid uberfan with no mercy or remorse. PLUS, I was able to read from my gorgeous new hardcover copy gifted to me by my best friend and that really does make all the difference, no?Update 9/15/21Re-read. Number 14. I cannot get over how beautiful this book is. Still my favorite after all these years. It only gets better with every re-read.Update 8/28/17Re-read. Number 13. :) I cry when Paul meets Gurney. I shiver when Jessica consoles Chani. I'm awestruck by the peaks and troughs of time, free-will, and the weakness in Paul even as he heroically strives against the evil that is about to be unleashed upon the universe. *sigh*Perfection. Easily the number one book I've ever read. :)I waver, sometimes, but right now, it is my absolute favorite. :)Original Review:This is a phenomenal classic of literature.It's not just science fiction. It transcends science fiction, as a fascinating discussion of free-will versus inevitability. Can the Jihad be denied? Can Paul ever really avoid his own death, despite seeing every time-line play out with him as the butt of every cosmic joke? Can even cruelty or mercy even remain comprehensible after such knowledge?Yes, I think this work outdoes Nietzsche. It certainly does a great job of making us care about the question.Is this all? Is this just a work that pays great justice to philosophy of action and inaction? Or is the novel merely a clever play at turning the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle into the physical embodiment of a man? It is that, of course. The Kwisatz Haderach can be many places at once, and he can be both alive and dead at the same time just like that certain cat.Is the novel a coming of age tale, first set as a mirror against his father Leto, only then to mirror the whole universe that had just turned against him? Yes, of course. He was, after all, both the product of all his upbringing and his genes, embodying the question of nature versus nurture. He was taught within many schools of martial arts and assassins, as well as training the mind in both the schools of the Mentats with their pure logic and that of the mystics, the Bene Gesserit, that allows complete control over the body down to the cellular level. And if this training wasn't enough, he was deeply schooled in politics, leadership, and the meaning of loyalty. The boy was raised right. Of course, that is nothing without ninety generations of genetic bloodline tampering from the Bene Gesserit, right? To become the fulcrum between cellular memory, tapping the minds and lives of all your genetic ancestors as well as tapping the ability to fold time and space, to become the eye of a storm of time.What a damn brilliant setup for one tiny character, no? His training links to the unlocking of his genes and to the life-extending and enveloping spice, Melange, to make him not merely aware of time in a theoretical sense, but eventually to be unable to discern what was in the past, the present, or the future. Here's a true Super-Man, well beyond Nietzsche.And don't believe for one second that this serious discussion about what would make a superior man makes for dull reading. No. We've got PLOT that's probably some of the most exciting and visceral in all of literature, driving us right into the web of intrigue, vengeance, treachery, and galactic politics. To quote the text, we've got ""Plans within Plans,"" and it hardly stops there. We know the House Atreides is falling into a trap laid by the Emperor and House Harkonnen, and yet free-will and pride prevents any chance to avoid it. The setup is brilliant and extremely political, giving us character sketches of some of the most brilliant and memorable characters of all time.Duke Leto, the Red Duke, the most honorable and beloved leader.Duncan Idaho, the emotional and intuitive hero.Gurney Halleck, archetypal loyalist and troubadour.Lady Jessica, the woman who ought to have had all honor in life, but was unjustly reviled and set aside for political necessity. (Chani being both her mirror and her eventual glory.)And of course, my favorite character of all time, Paul Muad'dib Atreides, the one that would prevent the greater evils he foresaw, and went to enormous lengths and sacrifice to achieve, but who eventually failed in his task because even a god cannot overcome destiny. (Or the will of so many minds set as one.)So damn brilliant.Frank Herbert spent five years writing this treasure, working and reworking it until he published it at age 25. None of his other works come close to this masterpiece, and there's little wonder. It was birthed, fully-formed, like Athena from Zeus's head, with enormous forethought and care. The worldbuilding was just as carefully formed, from the ecology of Arrakis and the life-cycles of the sandworms, to the history and the creation of the Fremen from their mild beginnings as Zensunni Wanderers, adherents to the Orange Catholic Bible, to their history of oppression so like those of those who are Jewish, to their settling and hardening of their bodies and souls in the wastes of Arrakis, also just like the Jewish who carved out a place for themselves in Israel. (Current politics aside, this was a very potent idea before 1965 when Herbert wrote this, and indeed, the core is still just as powerful when you turn it back to Muslims.)The Galactic culture is rich and detailed. The CHOAM economic consortium, with their monopoly on space travel and their need for the Spice to allow them to see a short period into the future to plot a safe course before folding space. The Empire is caught on a knife's edge between a single power and every other House who sit in the possibility of putting aside all their squabbles for the sole purpose of checking the Emperor, if they so desired. (And Duke Atreides was such a possible popular leader among all the Great Houses, which was the primary reason the Emperor wanted him dead.) And of course, we have our Villains. The Baron Harkonnen has always been a crowd pleaser. Brilliant in his own right, devious and able to corrupt anyone with just the right sorts of pressure, including a certain absolutely trustworthy doctor we might mention.""The Tooth! The Tooth!"" -- You can't handle the Tooth!Feyd Rautha Harkonnen is especially interesting for the question of nature versus nurture.The Bene Gesserit had intended him to mate with Paul, who should have been Leto and Jessica's daughter, and that offspring should have been the cumulation of ninety years of a breeding experiment to recreate the Kwisatz Haderach which had come about almost by accident during the Butlerian Jihad in the deep past, to overthrow the AI overlords.He was practically Paul's genetic twin, or at least, his potential to be the ""One who can be many places at once"" was on par with Paul. But instead of fulfilling the kind of destiny that we get with Paul, we see him grow up under the auspices of his Uncle the Baron, becoming as cruel and devious as he was deadly. He was the argument of nurture in the conversation, of course, and having so very little of it eventually cost him his life.I often wonder about the directions that Dune could have taken, all those little paths in time and circumstance that could have been. What if Feyd had been brought to Arrakis earlier and overwhelmed with Spice the way that Paul had? Sure, he wouldn't have been able to convert the unconscious changes into conscious manipulation, but he might have had enough glimpses of the future, the way that the Fremen did, to have given him the edge he would have needed to kill Paul.And then there's a relatively minor character, Hasimir Fenring, the Emperor's personal assassin, who was nearly the Kwisatz Haderach, himself. Unable to breed true, he was still potent enough to be completely hidden to Paul's time-sight in the same way that Paul was hidden from the Spacing Guild's weaker time-sight. His training as a skilled killer was also superior to Paul. He was, by all the hints and tricks in the tale, Paul's perfect downfall. It always gives me shivers to think about, and it was only in a single instant of both recognition and pity from Paul that stayed Fenring from killing our hero. It was just a moment of whim.The setup was gorgeous. Paul's pity, had it been missing at his moment of greatest triumph over the Emperor, would have meant Paul's assured death. I still wonder, to this day, what stayed Frank Herbert's hand from killing his most wonderful darling. We knew the pressure of religion and politics was going to have its way upon all the oppressed peoples of Dune. The return of a monstrous religious Jihad was going to happen one way or another, sweeping across the galaxy and toppling the Empire, regardless of Paul's frantic plans and desires. Paul's own death would only mean a higher level of fanaticism, and Frank Herbert's warning against unreasoning devotion would have been made even clearer with Paul's death.Perhaps it was pity that stayed his hand. Who are we to say who lives and who dies?If you really think this review is overlong, then I apologize, but please understand that I could absolutely go on and on much longer than this. It is a symptom of my devotion to this most brilliant of all tales.And yes, it still holds up very, very well after twelve reads. I am quite shocked and amazed."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22189348-adina,Rating 5 out of 5,"Update 2 March 2024I saw Dune 2 and the first one is nothing compared with it. Actually, most movies are nothing compared to Dune 2. Maybe Villeneuve is the real Kwisatz Haderach. Update! Just wanted to say how much I loved the movie. Go see it. It was probably good that there was a gap between the time I read this and the movie. Read 2015Amazing! A masterpiece of SF with which I will probably compare all SF books that I’ll read in the future. It goes in my favorites shelf. This is my 3rd attempt to read Dune and I am really grateful that I did not succeed the first two times I tried as I was too young to understand all the subtleties. I would have probably enjoyed it as a very well written adventure novel but nothing more. That would have been a pity as Dune is so much more than a story about space travel and epic battles between good and evil. It presents complex philosophical ideas, explores ecological issues, cultural identity and differences. Also a major theme is represented by religion and religious leadership. The disturbing part about this book, taken in the current political context, is how easily the Fremen can be identified with an Arab nation. The spice can be seen as “oil” and the Harkonnens as evil westerners/Russians that are exploiting the natural resources without thinking about the locals and the environment. I saw that others reviewers saw this as well."
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6431467-s-penkevich,Rating 5 out of 5,"‘Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.’The sheer scope and magnitude of this 1965 sci-fi drama is staggering, populated with an extensive cast of characters and a rich universe full of well-rounded lore, intricate politics where every actions is revealed as ‘plans within plans within plans,’ and dynamic cultures all set on a collision course of plot that rightfully earned it a wide readership and canonization as a “Classic” work. I found it lived up to the hype and opened itself up more upon a reread, validating the fond memories I had of it from reading it first as a young teenager smitten with anything sci-fi. This book has zero chill and everything is to extreme and epic levels, including the size of worms. But come for the Bene Gesserits, best part. While there isn’t much to say that likely hasn’t already been said better, I still want to pause and reflect on some key elements in Dune. This is such a well-crafted book that addresses themes of power, religion, historical records as mythmaking and environmental concerns in a narrative about proxy wars and power struggles that speak just as loudly today as it did about 1960s foreign policy. If you are looking for a book of epic proportions, you can’t go wrong with Dune.The best part about this book, to me, is the way it is constantly expanding. There is great world-building and a rich lore that recalls my glee first exploring The Lord of the Rings, but what really excites me is the way Herbert reveals it all. The book starts so small—a visit to a cottage from an old woman that seems like such a small scale fairy tale on page one—and swiftly becomes gargantuan and never stops growing. It leaves you constantly feeling yourself shrink beside a universe always revealing itself as more complex than you had realized. I enjoy the way Herbert only gives you the minimum of what you need to understand and lets it all slowly unfold when necessary.‘They've a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the familiar messiah pattern.’For newcomers, the basis of the book is that Paul has been quite literally bred to be a messiah and is engulfed in a difficult power struggle over a planet that essentially upholds the interplanetary economy through mining an addictive substance called “spice”. You might quickly find yourself thinking of spice as oil and the planet Arrakis as Middle East and Northern Africa (Tor put out a really great essay on the way Herbert engages with Muslim culture and traditions), you know, since there was a whole Cold War going on at the time and giving the villain Baron Harkonnen a first name like Vladimir might make you wonder if this is all an elaborate metaphor. The Baron saying ‘in politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures,’ might make you think of the three branches of US government. You get the idea. There are also WWII holdovers present, such as the Sardaukar as an elite fighting force trained on Salusa Secundus to make sure you catch the S.S. reference. That’s all very much there, but this book is so much more than a simple sci fi rendition of the Cold War and Herbert definitely wants you to apply these themes to our larger political and religious global interactions. ‘Fear is the mind-killer.’Another aspect I find fascinating in Dune is the depiction of Paul Atreides in the ‘chosen one’ trope. Paul has reservations, though not due to thinking he doesn’t deserve it (dude is royalty anyways, essentially) but because he fears what it will bring. Paul’s powers are enhanced through spice and he is able to perceive the future, and in almost every possible scenario he sees nothing but mass war in his name:’They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this—the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad.’The notion of precognition brings free will into question, particularly when a certain individual appears in visions of the future but dies before it happens. It becomes a universe where individual free wills are all acting upon one another in an attempt to control the narrative of time.’And what [Paul] saw was a time nexus within this cave, a boiling of possibilities focused here, wherein the most minute action—a wink of an eye, a careless word, a misplaced grain of sand—moved a gigantic lever across the known universe. He saw violence with the outcome subject to so many variables that his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern.’History is written by the winners, or so the saying goes, and much of this novel focuses on the way the narrative of time is constructed through the mythologizing of people and events. ‘History will call us wives,’ Jessica says to Chani, assuring her that her role as the lover to Paul will not be usurped by the princess he marries for the throne. Much of the book shows the dynamics between Paul as the Man and Paul as the myth, with characters like Stilgar recognizing that by being in service to the myth they too will be immortalized in the stories. Narratives become a form or power, and, as I’ll discuss soon, can be a form of control.Perhaps it is because power and control are so central to this novel that it feels so very timeless and just as applicable to 2021 as it did to 1965. In regards to power, leadership also becomes another key theme. ‘Power and fear,’ House Atreides Duke Leto says, ‘The tools of statecraft, ’ a sentiment later echoed with all the same key terms by Baron Harkonnen. The two leaders are set up at the start as foils to each other, each trying to have their grip on Arrakis (there are some strong colonialism themes in this book and it delves into how troubling it is and how even those we might view as the savior turn out to be just another oppressor and colonizer) but their leaderships are defined by Leto’s rule through caring for his people while Harkonnen sees everyone as a useful pawn.’A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.’Having recently finished The Dispossessed, I could have preferred some more voices in this book looking for better forms of ruling that don’t involve exploitation, but that’s not what this book is about so I’ll move on. What this book really focuses on is the ways power can be maintained, which crops up most in this novel through use of religion. ‘But it's well known that repression makes a religion flourish,’ we read, and the harsh life on Arrakis makes it the perfect setting where indoctrination of religion for the purpose of power can shape a community and unite them. Religion is a form of storytelling, having the people all believe in one shared story with all its myths and promises. ‘You deliberately cultivated this air, this bravura,’ Jessica instructs Paul, ‘you never cease indoctrinating.’ The stronger the shared faith, the more easily a leader can make them do what they need. It also helps that everyone is high as shit all the time. ‘Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same,’ Kynes's father says:‘An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties. This will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater bravery. We must depend not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as upon the bravery of a whole population.’Religion is being used constantly to shape the people for the purpose of their leaders, even in what seems an admirable purpose of turning desert Arrakis into a green paradise (and without a religious idea of paradise, how can a people who only know dry dirt and hardship even imagine a paradise?).‘The real wealth of a planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization—agriculture.’This latter bit is also extremely key to Dune. The planet itself is practically a character in the novel, much in the ways the landscape is like a character in Westerns. The landscape of Arrakis truly shapes the people there, and we see a contrast between Arrakis and Caladan and how water as a precious resource on Arrakis changes many customs. Such as how spitting at a person is a sign of respect on Arrakis. Changing the environment on Arrakis is an interesting concept because, in order to make it thrive, what would the cost be? Would it disrupt spice, thereby collapsing the galaxy’s economy? Can these people ever be free, because doing so would require the complete dismantling of the governmental systems currently ruling? Can I try this spice? I would like to try the spice.There is also something to be said about the harshness of an environment being an ideal place for strenght in unity around a cause to crop up. Le Guin explores this in The Dispossessed as well, with the anarchist planet having a similar dry desert vibe as Arrakis and scarcity being a major player in what keeps the people bonded and working together. The Fremen are tough because of their environment, similiarly the Sardaukar are trained in extremely harsh environments as well. Dune plays a lot with ideas on how fascism and strongmen can quickly rise to power in times of economic instability—or the threat of it—and here the difficult planets tend to produce the most deadly fighters. Mix religion in and you have an instant army if you can convince everyone you are the chosen one. There is so much more to discuss in this book, particularly the Bene Gesserits and the Guild who are pulling a lot of strings, or just how friggen awesome the worms are. This is a big book with a lot of big ideas, and also a lot of ambiguity to them that I really appreciate. It is certainly a precursor for a lot of popular epics to follow. George Lucas certainly took notes and I imagine George R.R. Martin read this and said “wait, you can just kill beloved characters that easily!?” before rewriting Duke Leto as Ned Stark. While I can concede to those who find it boring and dry, I rather enjoyed all the history and lore and found this to be incredibly fun. 4.5/5"

And, honestly, it was the main reason I've always wanted to read this book.Ohmygod look what that fake-looking piece of plastic shit is doing to poor MacLachlan's nose? How was he even able to act with that thing pushing his nostrils to the side of his face? I can't stop looking at it!Anyway.I remember loving that movie when I was young. Ahhhh. I honestly didn't remember much about it other than it was sorta weird, there were giant worms, a bunch of people had glowing blue eyes, and Sting was in it.After listening to this audiobook, I decided to rewatch the movie and relive the good times. Wow. Just wow. What in the holy hell did I just watch? Because whatever it was, it certainly didn't have much to do with the actual book. There were some fucking weird changes that they made to the movie that really didn't do anything for the plot. Like that gross dude with the shit in his face that flew around in that goofy air suit?In the book, he's just a fat dude!And that thing they do where they all have drain plugs attached to their hearts?Not in the book, either!In fact, none of that fucknut crazy/gross sci-fi shit is in the book.Blowing shit up with their voice guns? Nope.Bald Bene Gesserits? Nope.Bugs with butthole mouths? Nope.Mentat's with clip-on eyebrows who drink juice that gives them herpes lips? Nope.Captain Jean-Luc Picard going into battle with a pug? Fuck no!The list goes on and on...Not that it should matter. But it does! Because I was expecting something realllyreallyreally different, and if you go into this (like me) you may end up...well, not disappointed but maybe shocked? Having said that, I think the book was definitely better. There was no reason for ass-mouth monsters or oily rock stars in weird rubber underwear. It just makes a lot more sense the way Herbert wrote it. It's a magic is science tale set in space with an incredibly interesting look at how politics and religion can hold hands with each other and make war babies. I can see why people rave about it. It's honestly an incredibly insightful novel.You know, if you're into that sort of thing... A little dense, but worth it. But dense. That's worth saying twice because this thing is massive and you may get lost in it if giant word monsters aren't your jam when it comes to reading. I listened to the Audible version which is 21 HOURS (and 2 minutes!) long and might be the way to go for anyone looking for the easy way out.And I am ALWAYS looking for the easy way out."
15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84023-j-g-keely,Rating 3 out of 5,"People often forget that this series is what innovated our modern concept of science fiction (up until Neuromancer and The Martix, at least). Dune took the Space Opera and asked if it might be more than spandex, dildo-shaped rockets, and scantily-clad green women. Herbert created a vast and complex system of ancient spatial politics and peoples, then set them at one another's throats over land, money, and drugs.Dune is often said to relate to Sci Fi in the same way that Tolkien relates to Fantasy. I'd say that, as far as paradigm shift, this is widely true. Both entered genres generally filled with the odd, childish, and ridiculous and injected a literary sensibility which affected all subsequent authors.Few will challenge the importance of Star Wars' effect on film and storytelling in general, but without Dune, there would be no Star Wars. Princess Alia, the desert planet, the Spice, the Bene Gesserit, and Leto II all have direct descendants in the movies. It is unfortunate that Lucas seems to have forgotten in these later years that his best genius was pilfered from Herbert, Campbell, and Kurosawa.Though I have heard that the later books do not capture the same eclectic energy as the first, Dune itself is simply one of the most original and unusual pieces of Sci Fi ever written. Read it, Starship Troopers, Ringworld, Neuromancer, and Snowcrash and you'll know everything you need to about Sci Fi: that you want more."
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,Rating 5 out of 5," 2021 Reread - 5*I was totally blown away by the recent movie version of this, that much so I decided to revisit and revaluate my opinion of this extraordinary book. So, I read it again six years on and this is something I said I would never do because I found it so difficult to read the first time. It wasn’t the complexity of the world and politics, but the narration style which totally perplexed and frustrated me. Though I think that was more to do with my immaturity as a reader at the time than anything else. This is a difficult one, but it’s worth it. This time I was impressed with everything: the intelligence of the writing, the details of the world and the intricate nature of the storytelling. There’s just so much brilliance here. And it’s entertaining. It’s interesting. The balance is perfect. The Freman culture is driven by ideas of ecology, efficiency and waste reduction. And whilst they are not without their faults, the sense of oneness and appreciation they have for their home planet is a strikingly important commodity. I found them fascinating to read about and of the many thing this novel has going for it, they are the jewel in Herbert’s crown. I want to see more of this world. 
Original Review (2015) - 3.5*
I could never give Dune five stars because I really struggled to get into the novel in the beginning. It has taken me almost two months to read. This, for me, is a very long time to spend on a book. It took me so long to read because I found the writing style incredibly frustrating. I had to read whole chapters again so I could get the gist of the plot. This was more so in the beginning, which I found particularly hard to read because of the author’s way of shifting between the thoughts of multiple characters. I found this very annoying; however, I persevered over my initial despondency towards the writing, and plodded on through the book. I’m glad I did so because in the end I did come to really enjoy it. Indeed, the story is fantastic, but the writing will always remain unbearable for me.  A truly brilliant plot Dune is to science fiction what The Lord of the Rings is to high fantasy; it is the novel that officially, and unarguably, defines the genre. The story begins with the house of Atreides accepting the Dukedom of the planet Dune. The former Baron has been ousted by the Emperor, and is no longer of consequence. Well, that is how it initially appears. Very early on it revealed that the whole thing is a political ploy to bring the house of Atreides to its knees. The Baron lies in wait, and is ready to strike against the new, and benevolent, approach the Duke uses on the Fremen. The Fremen are the natives of the dessert planet; thus, they know how to survive its harshness above all others. They do this through their frugal approach to water. They value it above all else, and will never waste a drop in earnest. The Baron Harkonnen, as a chide against the natives, squanders water in the cruellest ways. He, and his dinner guests, throw cups of water on the floor of the dinner hall; it was his tradition. The wasted water was soaked up with towels, which the Baron allowed the Fremen to suck the water out of. When the Duke enters he rejects this custom, and is more respectful to the Fremen way of life. He and his son and heir Paul, who is the protagonist of this novel, go as far as to try the Fremen’s grossly effective water saving suits. These Stillsuits, quite literally, recycle all the water the body wastes and feeds it back to its wearer. The Fremen way is the right wayThis early familiarity, with the Fremen technology, no doubt helps to keep Paul’s mind open when he is later forced to live amongst the Fremen. Paul is somewhat of a marvel; he is prophecy’s chosen one. When he eventually gains the trust of the Fremen they allow him to choose a Fermen name. He calls himself after their most revered prophet: Muad'Dib. They accept this and follow him as their leader. His inherited title of Duke dictates that he is their lord, but their religion determines their real loyalty. He has to, quite literally, fight for every ounce of their trust. Indeed, it does not come cheap, and will only be given to one who is a member of their people. “Without change something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The sleeper must awaken.”Thus, Paul becomes their saviour. Consequently, he receives heaps of character development through this book. He goes form boy to the revered leader of a nation. The Fremen, like Paul, want the evil Baron Harkonnen gone from their planet. They do no want a cruel oppressor who is ignorant to their ways: they want Paul. I think the imagination behind the Fremen culture really is wonderful. They have efficiently adapted to survive their harsh planet. To emphasise this point you need only look at the fact that off-world humans live in fear of the giant Sandworms that infect the planet whereas the Fremen ride them as a coming of age ritual. Indeed, Paul has to ride a worm if the Fremen are to follow him. Deep characters The result of this is a very complex, and intriguing plot. I found the first third of this book to be very perplexing initially. This is a world we are told about rather than shown at the start. We hear about the Fremen but do not truly understand them till the very end. I was very overwhelmed at the beginning, and in all honesty I do think this novel merits a re-read to further establish my understanding of it. This did affect my rating because it inhibited by enjoyment of the book. “Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.”Indeed, aside from Paul there is a whole host of dynamic, and well rounded, characters. His mother is to be the new revered mother of the Fremen people, which for someone of her age is quite remarkable. There is also the captain of Duke Leto’s household guard who is a very deep and honourable individual. As much as I came to like these characters I was still frustrated with the writing of them in the beginning. I found it difficult to read scenes in which up to four characters internal thoughts are portrayed alongside their dialogue. It wasn’t always clear who was thinking. I much prefer a narrative that is focalised through one person. Well, at least one person per chapter.  Overall, I thought the idea behind this novel was utterly fantastic. However, my personal reaction to the writing style limited my overall enjoyment of the book. I do intend to read some of the sequels. However, I do not have any intention of doing so in the near future. Maybe, in a couple of years I will return to the brilliant, and annoyingly written, world of Dune.__________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________"

I do my best in the video linked above, but just know it probably isn't for the reasons you think.My journey to Dune becoming my absolute favorite book of all time goes all the way back to the mid-1990's upon finding it in my high school library and deciding to give it a try because I remembered my dad and brother watching the movie when I was a kid. At 15 years old, I got to the middle of ""book II"" and gave it a big fat DNF. I decided it just wasn't for me. At 17, for the 30th anniversary, I decided to try again and while I finished it that time, I thought the ideas were overly pretentious and way too out there. But a year went by and somehow, it was still in my head. I thought about it frequently and I began to ponder...did I actually really like it?I tried again the final weeks of my senior year of high school and became absolutely obsessed and it has stayed that way for almost the last 25 years.Dune is social science-fiction in that it's more concerned with the people and society than it is with hard science. Besides telling you that these navigators ""fold space"" for interstellar travel, Herbert doesn't bog you down with the math. He focuses more on the politics, cultures, religion, and philosophies of a world rich in the most valuable resource in the known universe, but barren in everything else.If you go into the story expecting a Star Wars style adventure, you're going to leave disappointed. Dune is extremely thought provoking and deals with the struggles of coming of age while the fate of the universe is on your shoulders. I'll also say that the book is certainly not for everyone. If you love things like ASOIAF and The Wheel of Time, there is no way this book won't be for you as both of those series borrowed heavily from the story Frank crafted. But I think it truly depends on where you are at in your life. Look, I just told you the story of how it took until my third reading for this to really click with me. Those who the story and lessons click with, it REALLY clicks with. But, again, this isn't a crowd pleaser and not everyone is going to love it, especially modern readers. So while I encourage those that are interested to read it, I expect more modern readers to not like it than like it.Not only is this the greatest science-fiction story of all time, but I believe it should be on mandatory reading lists in schools and everyone interested in the genre owe it to themselves to read the pillar of the genre they have come to love. Dune is every bit to science-fiction what Lord of the Rings is to fantasy."

“I have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.”
I don’t think I actually *enjoyed* this book. But I certainly respected the hell out of it. For a bit I thought I had it all figured out, pegged it as your bog-standard Chosen One story, and then it went where I didn’t think it’d go and neatly subverted my expectations. It tackled stuff that is uncomfortable and therefore is generally handwaved over in the usual SF epics. And for that I seriously respected this dense complex tome. We people tend to love the idea of a charismatic all-powerful leader who inspires faithful following and true fervor, that cult-like blind devotion. We give those leaders tremendous power to lead and decide and determine fates. So many stories rooted in the weight of our species collective history glorify this; so many countries still apparently yearn for powerful visionary leaders that others proclaim to be dictators. So many religions go to wars over the legacy left by a popular charismatic leader centuries ago, interpreting those legacies as the engine for the action, destruction, obedience.Hero worship. Messianic worship. Prophecies and tyrannies. Desire for a Savior to rescue you from the evil. Good intentions paving the road to hell. It all leads to terrifying places which we may be powerless to stop.
“A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a people reverts to a mob.” This is a novel of a reluctant Messiah, the journey of a man becoming the Chosen One — but unlike the traditional story of a charismatic savior, this is a darker picture of the dangers of messianism and hero worship, of allowing blind devotion replace common sense. The book ends in an ambiguous place, and I presume the sequels may develop the theme or run away from it and make this a more traditional hero journey. But I certainly hope not. Because the dark implications of messianism say more about human nature than the happier stories based on the same idea, but with more idealism. We love our ideas of ideal benevolent rulers who can set things right, don’t we? Or the martyr figures inspiring “righteous” battles? Messiahs and figureheads seem to fulfill the deep-seated cultural longing for an inspirational leader, don’t they? Friends become followers and worshippers, and the metaphorical slope becomes quite slippery. 
 “The Fremen have a simple, practical religion,"" he said.""Nothing about religion is simple,"" she warned.But Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found himself swayed by anger. He could only say: ""Religion unifies our forces. It's our mystique.""""You deliberately cultivate this air, this bravura,"" she charged. ""You never cease indoctrinating.""""Thus you yourself taught me,"" he said.”
Yes, in Dune Frank Herbert hints at the dangers present in such ideas. What seems like your traditional hero’s journey turns out darker and more sinister. But it’s not the rise of an antihero either. It’s subtler than that, without actually being all that subtle. 
“No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero,"" his father said.
Paul Atreides, in his own words, is “something unexpected.” A son of a planetary Duke (because an interstellar post-technology future is actually feudal) and a highly trained Bene-Gesserit concubine of the Duke (basically a member of the order/Sisterhood of superpowered highly trained mind ninjas with strong political worlds-changing ambitions and generations-long breeding experiments aimed at creation of a controllable superhero), Paul fits very well the idea of a Messiah of the tribal resilient society of Fremen people of the harsh desert planet Arrakis, neatly fulfilling their religious prophecies (that may have been stealthily planted before by the above-mentioned supernatural ninja order) and possessing genetic superpowers himself, augmented by rigorous training and catalyzed by the ingestion of a magical wonder-drug known as spice. 
“He found that he no longer could hate the Bene Gesserit or the Emperor or even the Harkonnens. They were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance, to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes. And the race knew only one sure way for this—the ancient way, the tried and certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad.”
But Paul through his prescient powers can see what his mythologized destiny leads to. A galactic scale slaughter led by fanatics in his name. And there is not a way to escape it, once your life fits the mysticism of their faith (even if the faith and prophecies were stealthily prereplanted for sort of a similar purpose). Religious fanatics are destined to wage a brutal war that the Messiah is unable to stop. 
“When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious, fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.”
With great power comes great responsibility, and all that jazz. But is any of it actually worth it? Wouldn’t the world be better without the burden of Heroes? Are you destined to become exactly what you’re trying to avoid?All this is gently hinted at, laid out in the framework of the appealing Hero’s journey. It seems that should you desire, you can still easily choose to read it as a typical hero’s/antihero’s story, just less idealistic than it could be. But that would be Star Wars and not Dune.
“He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous, ruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad'Dib's motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of his triumph, he saw the death prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad'Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: ""I am the Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough.” And you also can’t help but be mesmerized by a harsh desiccated planet where life is focused on survival, where not even water but mere moisture is the most coveted and rarest thing, where hopes for a better, wetter, greener future quietly flourish, tied into messianic ideas but grounded in science. The place of nightmares, written vividly and skillfully, making me want to gulp down a gallon of drink just because I can, making me appreciate that my reality doesn’t hinge on surviving on my reclaimed bodily fluids.The world is harsh, unforgiving, brutal, hostile. The characters - well, mostly Paul, but to an extent his mother Jessica as well - are cold, calculating, composed and often very unsympathetic. Paul’s father values lives over property. Paul’s actions, on the other hand, lead to eyebrow-raising among his father’s old lieutenants who note the difference in priorities:
 “Nothing money won't repair, I presume,"" Paul said.""Except for the lives, m'Lord,"" Gurney said, and there was a tone of reproach in his voice as though to say: ""When did an Atreides worry first about things when people were at stake?”
It’s dense and complex, full of politics, short on actual science fiction but full of ruminations on human nature — and it leaves me feeling that all of this is a beginning of another cycle of violence, just with a new figurehead at the mast. As Terry Pratchett said, “But here's some advice, boy. Don't put your trust in revolutions. They always come around again. That's why they're called revolutions.” A new Hero or a new Messiah comes, and begets another cycle or struggle and violence, to be reset anew by a new figurehead sometimes in the future. All while sandworms quietly slither under the sand.—————Oh yeah, there are sandworms, too.—————4 stars out of respect for Herbert’s subversive story that made me think. I’m content with the story ending here, with ambiguity and dread for what’s to come."

Essentially, only this, the first one, is a real science fantasy epos, while the others are mostly circulating around the characters' special skills and family problems without much meta, plot, or different settings.Just this first milestone is big in the epic worldbuilding department and some other things I´ll try to point my primate fingers at.

Because how the traditions, monsters, and badass special moves of the inhabitants influence the planetary and intergalactic trade and travel balance is slowly presented to the reader, while the impact of the wonderful spice expands its glow towards total domination.Don´t take drugs except they make you superhumanAs so often, a prescription free pharmaceutical wonder cure can solve all of your problems until corporate interests come and ruin everything by using anything in their armory to get control over the precious resource of psychohistoric psi precognition power. The idea of one substance changing the whole balance of power of the galaxy is big in many sci-fi series and especially terrifying for each arrogant, high tech civilization, because an animal creating impervious shields, an immortality tonic, a mind altering super drug, etc., could enable far weaker, steampunky tribes to destroy them. Classic barbarian hordes on magic mushrooms looting Rome style.Bene GesseritWho says that centuries long, epigenetic, elitist breeding programs have to be completely evil all the time? Except for the poor lovers aroused by the wrong, not arranged partner, stupid Romeo and Juliet syndrome complexes, you have to see the bigger picture and control your hormones and feelings and sacrifice some biochemical illusions to create the ÜberPsi mentat mentalist mind penetrator. However, it works with less evil too. Together with the spice, this elite mental mind control academy with the aim to finally create the ultimate space JC messiah figure to defecate rainbows, freaking galactic peace, pink unicorns, and gold, is the backbone of the whole trilogy, because impacts of both and the excessive use of it as MacGuffins and Chekhovs plot devices lead to the question:Is this still really sci-fi or not more a high fantasy thing with some sci-fi elements?Well, highly subjectively, yes, Dune is mostly psi fantasy dressed in futuristic clothes with some faith, tech, technobabble (rare), and trade in between, which makes it one of the most outstanding and unusual sci-fi works, I mean fantasy camouflaged as sci-fi. Tricky, one is so indoctrinated to call this thing sci-fi that it took me a reread and absorbing many reviews to realize what´s really going on. I´m really not sure about this whole thing, I´ve read a ton of sci-fi and my alien mind parasite, in a kind of perverted symbiosis with the xenovirus making me look fresher I deliberately bought for this purpose like a tapeworm therapy to lose weight (you don´t want to know what this costs on the alien bioweapons black market, the second half of my immortal soul exactly), tells me that there still would a lot of story without the sci-fi elements, while close to nothing would be there after removing fantasy, faith, drugs, and mind penetrating abilities, so, yea. I mean, even the planet itself doesn´t really has sci-fi fractions or something, the space around it is kind of empty without many sci-fi parties, cyborgs, aliens, everything substantial seen in close to any big sci-fi series. This leads me to An unpopular and possibly controversial opinionIt could be that Herbert is, and I am just talking about the sci-fi aspect, a bit overrated or, let´s precisely define it, overhyped as a sci-fi author because he is more of a fantasy writer. This couldn´t happen in a fantasy world, because parts of the legions of readers of the genre don´t want aliens and Clarketech mixed in their magic, not to speak of the suspension of disbelief problem that often comes with sudden future tech elements in fantasy, that´s just disgusting. The other way round, as with Dune, is much easier, just put some sci-fi around fantasy and everything just rolls perfectly. Is terraforming destroying cultural heritage or making inhabitable worlds paradises?The ethical implications of this question are another sci-fi old school vehicle, especially if the terrible acid rain, high gravity, parasite infested, or dirty desert land is the only region where the special, red plotline device can grow and thrive. One could go so far as to ask if there are real life examples on earth, conservation vs corporate environmentalism, greenwashing and stuff (spoiler warning: conservation lost, earth is dying), and how this should be dealt with in decades, centuries, or millennia when we (I hope you are immortal too thanks to alien symbiont virus cooperation like me, if you aren´t, poor you, may I infect you? Just 20.000 of whatever your fringe financial system uses as fiat money that will be worthless as soon as natural apocalypse, mutually assured destruction, or alien invasion make it obsolete, and you get the parcel. Shipping not included.) start manipulating weather, geophysics and- chemistry, and climate of other worlds to make it sexy, tropical, tourist friendly paradises at the low cost of exterminating all alien life, but this would be a bit far fetched. Herberts´place in the sci-fi or sci-fa hall of fame.That´s tricky, especially because he just couldn´t keep delivering after the third part. I´ve played around with the fourth and fifth part, but had to abandon it because it escalated to too much unmotivated, philosophical drivel without a real plotline and a place in the big picture of the series, Herbert just didn´t manage to hold it all together. What made the first three parts, that they are kind of eccentric, ingenious standalones without the classic space opera series uniting plotline and style, great, kind of destroyed the rest of the series. Because he had no more vision for the meta, high sci fa elements, Herbert lost control over his own creation and just manufactured hearthless shells to sell more books.But that doesn´t mean that the first three parts aren´t milestones of the interdisciplinary genre, exploring it in new ways no one imagined before while reaching Lem-, Clarke-, and Asimov levels of subtle, intelligent dialogues, innuendos, connotations, and character driven development. It´s something unique, special, and definitively not for anyone because of its high entry barriers that may annoy some readers, but don´t let yourself be easily deterred by that, it´s totally worth it once you´re in and high as heck and addicted forever to the wonderful, delicious spice melange.

20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27098959-leonard-gaya,Rating 5 out of 5,"Dune is often considered a masterpiece of 20th-century American science fiction. In part, the book owes its reputation to the film adaptation David Lynch directed in the early 1980s (although this movie was, and still is, not considered one of his best). Frank Herbert wrote a novel of epic proportions, in other words, a space opera, with its intergalactic feudal society, its decadent (if not evil) empire and its band of rebels: the book was published some ten years before the first instalment of the Star Wars series. Indeed, along with Asimov’s (overrated) Foundation stories, it was George Lucas’ primary source of inspiration.One of the most exciting aspects of Herbert’s creation is the multi-cultural world he depicts. Each house (Atreides, Harkonnen, etc.), each planet (Arrakis, Giedi Prime, Caladan...), each group (the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, the Guild, the Emperor’s suite and the Sardaukars) has its specific flavour, its own culture, its language — the comprehensive index at the end of the book is utterly fascinating. For each of these cultures, Herbert borrowed traits from traditions (ancient or contemporary) he knew well in reality, especially from the Middle East. In particular, Paul Atreides / Muad’Dib’s story among the Fremen is redolent of the historical events around T.E. Lawrence and the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire. And Paul’s crusade on Arrakis is told, as though it were ancient history, in the chronicles by the Princess Irulan at the start of each chapter.Herbert describes his fictional world and characters in great detail, which contributes to the richness of his narrative, but I found these descriptions somewhat boring and, especially, the middle of the book is a bit dragging for that reason. In my view, the most impressive parts of this novel are the dialogues, where Herbert simultaneously reveals what the characters are saying and thinking. This technique lends a sense of duplicity and scheming to almost every interaction. Everyone is plotting one way or another so that the whole thing ends up being like a great Shakespearean play, with dialogues and asides, tyrants and pretenders. What confirms this impression is not only the theme of the exiled Duke (see As You Like It, King Lear, or The Tempest), but also the repeated scenes of fencing duels throughout, with feints and poisoned tips: a clear allusion to the endings of Hamlet and Macbeth, for instance.Edit: A word about Denis Villeneuve’s new film adaptation of Herbert’s novel (part 1, 2021). Comparisons are odious and obviously wouldn’t be to David Lynch’s advantage. This is a Dune version for a new generation of fans and an epic movie on par with Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy, in the early 2000s. The settings (filmed in Scandinavia and the Middle East) are breathtaking, and the actors have so much going for them. But what strikes me the most in this new version is the sense that everything is overwhelming and sublime: the massive architecture, the crushing machines, the extreme weather conditions, the earth-shattering landscapes, the thunderous music, the tragic events, the repulsive foes. From the relenting waves of Caladan to the searing and unending skies of Arrakis, everything assumes an oceanic and staggering dimension."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol,Rating 4 out of 5,"I blame the movie.I was an avid but novice fantasy and sci-fi reader in 1984 when David Lynch’s Dune rolled out as a big-budget adaptation of the 1965 classic book. It was an artistic and box-office failure with Roger Ebert calling it “a real mess, an incomprehensible, ugly, unstructured, pointless excursion.” Numerous references were made to its excessive length, particularly a tv edition that was over 3 hours long. I never did pick up the classic sci-fi book, assuming the commentary heard about the movie applied to the book. All that changed when I broke my finger and found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands (groan).Besides, sandworms. Dune has a lot of ingredients that don’t fit into my preferred stories, yet the gestalt was not only tolerable, but engrossing. It begins with the Atreides family preparing to shift their holding from their current home to the planet of Arrakis. The Emperor has given the Atreides the territory and trade on the planet of Arrakis, formerly under control of their enemies, the Harkonnen. The planet Arrakis is hot, arid and generally hostile to life. There is, however, a small population of native, fierce Freman who have managed to build an existence in the desert. Paul Atreides is the young heir of the family, and mystical testing reveals he might be the one prophesied. Paul undergroes a rapid growth curve, facilitated by his teacher Dr. Yeuh and his father’s advisors. But it is in the desert that Paul will discover his strength as well as his new people. Seriously, now.Honestly, I have to wonder how much of this like is generational. If Sanderson or Rothfuss wrote this book, two chapters in Dune would have made a whole book, and while detail may have been added, it likely would have made for a book as slow as the movie. I liked the scope of Dune, and that there is a resolution to the initial conflict. It is also interesting that despite the volume of concepts packed in here, with political maneuvers, terraforming, technology, cultural assimilation, and mysticism all playing roles that I didn’t find it overwhelming, perhaps because so much is genre-familiar. On the downside, it could have perhaps used a bit more transitions, particularly near the end when months at a time are skipped. Writing was solid; nothing really stood out, but it told the story well. There’s some vague mysticism that might irritate those who like explanations. It was a bit of an eye-roller to have the chief villain be a fat, gay, sadistic pedophile, but Herbert really isn’t thinking outside the trope character box much (it’s not enough that he sentences people to death but he has to be physically abhorrent? And gay?). World-building is fun, but standard desert.Overall, I’m glad that I finally took the time to read it and put those old assumptions to rest. I love a good hero. "
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro,Rating 5 out of 5,"[UPDATED]I reread Dune for the first time in several decades and immensely enjoyed it. I also went back to watch the original cult feature film by David Lynch and had quite mixed feelings - while it was close to the overall aesthetic that Frank Herbert describes with the gorgeous desert sets and the terrifying worms, the parts of the story that were necessarily culled out was disturbing (that and the woeful special effects at the time trying (and IMHO failing) to visualize the personal shields that the characters wear in hand-to-hand combat). For those who are just discovering Dune for the first time, it is essentially a messianic story on a desert planet (think of Jesus or perhaps Mohammed on Tatooine) in a universe dominated by a cartel (the Guild also known as CHOAM) with a monopoly on a drug (called mélange) derived from a rare material (spice) available only on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune). This drug is so powerful that it allows the Guild (and later Maud'dib) to leverage space-time singularities to defy the speed of light and travel anywhere in the universe. Overlaid on this foundation, the epic battle of the feudal houses of the noble Atreides and the evil Harkkonen houses rages, the betrayal of the former by the latter explicitly endorsed by the Emperor (himself an almost impuissant pawn of the Guild as well). All that to say that the fabric of the story is multilayered and as complex and complete a universe as you will find in George RR Martin or Dan Simmons. There are several enhanced human species running around: the Mentats who have been cerebrally enhanced to be able to calculate like supercomputers (computers themselves having been banned!) and each then uses their predictive analytics for their assigned Dukes (or the Emperor) and the Bene Gesserit cult who are a sort of quasi-religious non-celibate nuns who have honed perception and language to the point of having developed nearly superpower-level strengths of persuasion which are almost universally feared and vilified as sorcery in the rest of the universe. Paul Atreides, heir to the throne, is born to Jessica, a Bene Gesserit, possessed some of these powers and when the family moves to Arrakis (part of the aforementioned Harkkonen plot) from their home planet Caladon, he appears to the native Freeman population as perhaps a fulfillment of their messianic prophecies and hopes. In perhaps the most critical departure from the book, the Lynch movie does not really show Paul questioning the awesome power that he possesses and his assumption of the mantle as the Arrakis Messiah, the Maud'dib (something that the 2021 film by Denis Villeneuve does thankfully address). In the book, one aspect that I loved was how Paul struggled with this messianic destiny and did everything he could to subvert it. One of the unique gifts he received, presumably as the rare and unique offspring of a Bene Gesserit, was the ability to see possible outcomes (like a Mentat) and thus he could take decisions based on the most likely foreseen outcome. It made for great reading.The other great thing about Dune is the aesthetic of this desert planet with impossibly huge worms under the surface who are mysteriously connected to spice and pose a danger to all creatures in the desert except for the Freeman. The still suit which recycles body water in the deep desert was brilliant as was the ever-present obsession with ""water debt"" of the Freemen. I really felt like I was walking unevenly (must not attract the worms!) through the sand with Jessica and Paul before their fateful encounter with the Freemen. Dune is a well-deserved classic for all the reasons I mentioned above and probably much more that I missed. I have read it twice and gotten almost entirely different things out of it each time. I have since read all the canonical Frank Herbert books in the series and enjoyed it all immensely.[UPDATE] I am looking forward to Denis Villeneuve's Dune in October 2021. The previews I have seen so far seem to be quite coherent with respect to the book. I was a fan of Lynch's Dune and am curious to see what Villeneuve does with this one. Feel free to comment below.[UPDATE] Villeneuve’s 2021 film covers half of the book and does a fantastic job as both an homage to Herbert’s book and Lynch’s film. The casting, costumes, CGI, and script are all top-notch. Dune lovers have every reason here for rejoicing. One key difference from the Lynch film is that we do not see the Guild Navigators, so we can hope that they show up in the second half!Fino's Dune ReviewsDuneDune MessiahChildren of DuneGod Emperor of DuneHeretics of DuneChapterhouse: Dune"
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59458347-petrik,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5/5 StarsDune oh Dune, seems like I need to raise my Shield Wall for this review.Dune is one of the most important pieces of literature for the Sci-Fi genre. I’ve been raking my brain for hours on how to properly explain the importance of Dune in the sci-fi literature but you know what? I dune (hehehe) think it’s necessary for me to do so. If you truly wanna know why, you can search it on whatever search engine you use and you'll find hundreds of articles or reviews on why this book is that important; and they’ll do a much better job than me. I won’t even deny any of them because, in my opinion, this book was truly revolutionary. Dune didn’t become the number one highest selling Sci-fi novel of all time for no reason; like Brian Herbert said, it is to Sci-Fi, what the LOTR trilogy is to fantasy.Theoretically, if I’m reviewing this by putting my head as someone from 1960’s or 1970’s, I know I would think of this book as my bible. 1965 was the year when Dune was published for the first time, 24 years before I was born. There are just too many groundbreaking ideas, world-building, that would become the inspirations for many Sci-fi in our time; I only realized this after reading this book. I mean, the gigantic Sandworm alone has inspired many video games to use it as a common monster or enemy. Picture: Dune by Marc SimonettiDesert planet, Stillsuits, space exploration, and Zen Buddhism, Dune was truly a groundbreaking novel, almost everything in this book somehow seems prophetic because it has predicted our current society, especially when it comes to faith, emotional control, empathy, and the importance of ecology and scarcity.

“The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.”

Part of what made this book was great for me was Herbert’s prose. I haven’t read enough classic to claim it was classical, but Herbert’s prose was definitely unique to me. It has a lot of freedom by writing it from a limited omniscient narrative; changing POV’s repeatedly in a single chapter without any warning. This is, honestly, one of my biggest pet peeves in my usual read, but Herbert made it work because all his characters were really well written, distinct in their personality, and the dialogues are really well dune (HEHEHE). Plus, there are so many motivational and extremely philosophical quotes that seem to make this book a combination of Sci-Fi & self-help book, such as:

“It is so shocking to find out how many people do not believe that they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.”

And of course, the most famous and one of the best quote I’ve ever read out of any book

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”

I can’t believe I have gone through life without knowing about this litany against fear. It’s applicable in any kind of hardship we faced in real life, and I know it will be one of my motto starting from now. If I’m judging this book solely from how significant this book was, I’ll give it maximum score in a heartbeat. However, I’m reviewing this based on one question and how I rated all the books I read: was it enjoyable?The answer is yes and no, it was a mixed bag. The first part of this book was incredible, I couldn’t put down the book and everything was so interesting and compelling. Then comes the second part, where the pacing just became really draggy and somehow, boring. However, my hope was restored for a while during the third act, until the anti-climax happened. My expectation is obviously at fault here but hey, this book is the number one highest selling sci-fi book of all time and one of the most highly acclaimed book, I expected there to be a mind-blowing climax sequences to close the book in an epic way. But no, there wasn’t any. Not only it felt anti-climactic, Herbert’s prose in describing settings and actions didn’t age well or up to current standard. The main reason for this is that this is a book that relies heavily on character’s dialogues to do everything; world-building, plot, characterizations were done solely through dialogues. This leads to the great plot but weak action sequences and no vivid settings. Sure there was some explanation on the settings, but other than the planet—which is just a desert, just search Sahara or Planet Tatooine and voila—the interiors were given only brief description, which makes it hard to imagine; I had to look up some artworks to be able to immerse myself in the settings of the book.Overall, Dune was truly a revolutionary book for its time that is filled with tons of imaginative and fantastic ideas. Although there were some parts that disappointed me, I still liked the book and I finally understand why there are so much discussion and praises around this book. I recommend this to every Sci-fi fans for its importance and also, it’s good to know where most fantastic Sci-Fi you’ve read or you’re reading now got its idea from. However, this is also where I’ll stop with the series.You can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106675807-aleksandra,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5/5Honestly, I never know exactly how to start my review after finishing a nearly nine hundred pages book, but I guess I'll start by saying that I definitely enjoyed it, but was it a life-changing reading experience? Unfortunately, not for me. This book is considered a classic of the science fiction genre, Frank Herbert did an amazing, or even one of a kind job, creating the entire universe in which Dune takes place, all the characters, descriptions and practically everything in this book was simply fascinating. I really wanted to be one of those people who closes this book and is completely in love with it, and then when someone asks if they've read it say ""Yeah, I love Dune, it's my favorite book."" but as it turns out, I'm not that person. At least, yet. This is the first story in a six-volume series, so I hope that changes.Like I said, I liked it, but I genuinely think I would have loved it if I hadn't watched the movies. In my opinion, the movies are even a close-to-being-perfect adaptation of the Herbert’s work and pretty much everything that happened in the book also happened in the first two films - with some small changes and a few scenes were in a different order, but it didn't change the fact that I still very much enjoyed watching both of them. Dune I and Dune II, being great adaptations, unfortunately meant that watching them before reading the book wasn't the best idea as I was bored for most of the story because I just knew what was going to happen. The first four hundred pages took me the longest to read because I watched Dune I twice, but thankfully it took me much less to finish the rest. The beginning (read the said first four hundred pages) were hard to read - which may not be much of an incentive for those planning to start I know - but the second half of the book even got me hooked. Frank's writing style may not have been entirely to my liking, the ""wow, what's happening"" moments didn't shock me as much as I thought they would, but the characters were amazing so I have to thank them because they are the reason for me being invested. Jessica was definitely my favorite here, followed by Paul, which I know is a boring answer, but what can I say, I liked them. They may even have become my favorite son and mother duo in books, which says a lot considering I've read a lot of stories in my life. 

""If you harm my son,” she said, “you’ll have me to meet. I call you out now. I’ll carve you into a joint of—""“Mother.” Paul stepped forward, touched her sleeve. “Perhaps if I explain to Jamis how—” “Explain!” Jamis sneered.""

Finally ending my rant, because I didn't plan to write so much, which is basically still nothing, because you could talk and talk without the end about this book, but I definitely plan to continuing this series. Maybe I'll even manage to finish all six books this year, we'll see. I hope at least.——————maybe I'll be able to read all six books by the time the next movie comes out (2027?) we'll see (I'm already having trouble with all the names)"
25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have to write this review without rhythm so that it won’t attract a worm.In the distant future Arrakis is a hellhole desert planet where anyone who doesn’t die of thirst will probably be eaten by one of the giant sandworms. It’s also the only place where the precious spice melange can be found so it’s incredibly valuable, and the honorable Duke Leto Atreides has been ordered by the Padishah Emperor to take over control of Arrakis from his mortal enemies, the House Harkonnen. While this seems like a great offer on the surface the Duke and his people realize that it’s actually a cunning trap being set by the Emperor and Baron Harkonnen. The only hope seems to be allying with the local populace called Fremen whose harsh environment has led them to become an incredibly tough and disciplined people, but they have their own vision of what Arrakis should be. They also have a prophecy about the coming of a messiah figure who will lead them to freedom, and the Duke’s son Paul looks like he may be exactly who they’ve been waiting for.This is classic sci-fi that really deserves the label. What Frank Herbert accomplished in one novel is stunning because he built a fascinatingly detailed universe in which the politics, religion, economics, espionage, and military strategy are all equally important. He then blended these more grounded concepts with bigger sci-fi ideas like being able to use spice to see through space-time, and the scope of that encompasses trying to pick the proper path through various potential timelines as well as free will vs. fate. I think one of the factors that helps this story stay timeless is that so much of it is based on what humanity becomes vs. trying to predict what futuristic technology would be like. This is a society that once had a war with machines and has since rejected any type of computers so people have developed to fill the gap with the help of the spice. The Mentats are trained to use data to predict outcomes. The Navigators of the Guild have used so much of the spice to help them move through space that they’re mutating. The all female Bene Gesserit have developed a variety of skills to place their members alongside positions of power to help advance their breeding scheme that spans generations. Herbert also cleverly came up with an excuse that explains why knives and hand-to-hand combat are so important with the idea of the personal body shields. So even though we still got a good sci-fi’s novel worth of cool gadgets the emphasis is on what the people can do and how that’s developed over a long period of time. It also adds a lot of depth to the political dimensions because all of these groups have different agendas that cause them all to mistrust each other, but because they all fill these various roles none can exist without the others.There are also parallels to our world that are still in play because the idea of a desert people caught up in the power struggles of various outsiders because of their valuable natural resource is an obvious allegory to the Middle East that still works today. Plus, the classic film Lawrence of Arabia came out a few years before Herbert published this, and you have to think that it had some influence on him because there are elements of the story that seem very much inspired by it.While the whole concept of a Chosen One has gotten a bit worn over time that’s not Herbert’s fault, and this is still a fantastic sci-fi story with big ideas that also works as space opera as well as being an epic adventure story."

At least the 2020-me did exactly same things with one difference: I threw boozes into equation! )  When I reread the series I clearly understand why I became addicted to the them( I’m talking about entire books)Firstly you find yourself drawn into this journey after reading few pages because Herbert’s storytelling skills are extraordinarily. The meaningful interludes, the character development, the impressive world building transform you to the other universe that you never want to leave. The awakening parts of Paul who discovers his own abilities, epic dynasty battles, ominous sand worms , intrigues, revenge, mind games present us a perfect blend of political economical, sociological, theological themes. I advise you to read the books first to understand the deeply ideological messages and unique philosophy of the series because sometimes the screenwriters have hard time to absorb and reflect the entire soul of the book! At least by reading the main story by yourself, you may directly reach to the core!  Here are my favorite quotes of the book: “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”“Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.”“The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.”“When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movements become headlong - faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late.”“Hope clouds observation.”“It is impossible to live in the past, difficult to live in the present and a waste to live in the future.”“Fear is the mind killer.”“Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free.

Much of this is enabled by the spice melange, which is found only on Arrakis, a desert planet with giant sand-worms as its most notable native life-form.Melange improves general health, extends life and can bestow limited prescience, and its rarity makes it a form of currency in the interstellar empire. Melange allows the Spacing Guild's Navigators to safely route faster-than-light travel between planets, and helps the Reverend Mothers of the matriarchal Bene Gesserit to access their Other Memory, the ego and experiences of their female ancestors.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و چهارم ماه نوامبر سال 2018میلادیعنوان: تلماسه؛ نویسنده: فرانک هربرت؛ مترجم: مهیار فروتن فر؛ تهران، کتابسرای تندیس؛ 1397؛ در 847ص؛ فروست شاهکارهای علمی تخیلی؛ شابک 9786001822834؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده مریکا - سده 20مداستان «تل‌ماسه» در آینده‌ ای دور می‌گذرد، و در جامعه‌ ای ملوک الطوایفی، کتاب با الهام از جوامع «اعراب» بدوی، نگاشته شده‌ است؛ سه عامل اثرگذار در جامعه ای فراسیاره‌ ای: پادشاه امپراتور و خاندان‌های حکومتی، اتحادیه ی فضایی (صاحب انحصار حمل و نقل فضایی)، و گروه «بنی جزریت»، هستند؛ در جهانی سوار بر همان سه‌ پایه‌ ی: «سلطه‌ جویی»، «سیاست‌بازی» و «سوداگری»، و گردنده بر چرخِ آدم‌کشانِ رایانه‌ سان، ساحرانِ نژادپرور، و ناوبرانِ زمان‌ نورد، «پُل»، دوک‌ زاده‌ ی جوان خاندان «آتریدیز» است، که خود را گرفتار در طوفانی عالم‌ آشوب می‌یابد؛ نزاعی کیهانی بر سر کیمیای زمانه است، در آوردگاهی یگانه، سرچشمه‌ ی کیمیا در سرتاسر کائنات: «تلماسه» است، کره‌ ای از شن سوزان، که دغدغه‌ ی بومیانش نه «ملغما (کیمیای زمانه)»، که بقاست؛نقل از متن (کتاب اول: تلماسه: سرآغاز هر کار زمان حصول اطمینان از درستی میزانها و معیارهاست؛ حتی مبتدی ترین شاگردان مکتب «بنه جسریت» هم این نکته را میدانند؛ پس فراموش نکنید که در شروع مطالعه ی زندگانی مودِّب او را در زمان حیاتش که از پنجاه و هفتمین سال سلطنت امپراتورْ پاشا شدامِ چهارم آغاز شد و در محل زندگی اش یعنی سیاره ی آراکیس در نظر آورید؛ اجازه ندهید این حقیقت که زادگاه او کالادان بوده و پانزده سال آغازین عمرش را در آنجا گذرانده گمراهتان کند؛ آراکیس، سیاره ای که آن را به نام تلماسه میشناسند، جایگاه او بوده و تا ابد خواهد بود؛ ـ برگرفته از کتاب راهنمای مودِب، نوشته ی شاهدخت «آیرولان») یک هفته پیش از مهاجرت خاندان «آتریدیز» به «آراکیس»، در میان دوندگیهای لحظه ی آخر که دیگر داشت به جنونی افسار گسیخته و تحمل ناپذیر بدل میشد، عجوزه ای به دیدار مادرِ پُل آمد کاخ «کالادان» شب نسبتاً گرمی را میگذراند و مانند تمام اوقات پیش از بارندگی، روی تخته سنگهای برهم چیده ی کهنسالی که برای بیست و شش نسل از خاندان «آتریدیز» حکم خانه را داشتند، نم سردی نشسته بود عجوزه از درِ جانبی وارد عمارت شد، و با عبو�� از راهرویی طاقدار به اتاق پل رسید؛ در آنجا لحظه ای درنگ کرد، و به داخل سرک کشید تا نگاهی به «پل» بیندازد که در تختخوابش آرمیده بود پسرک که حالا بیدار شده بود، در کورسوی چراغ معلقی که نزدیک به زمین شناور بود، پیکر تنومند زنی را میدید که در درگاه اتاقش، یک قدم جلوتر از مادرش ایستاده بود؛ چهره ی سایه وش پیرزن به جادوگران میمانست: موهای درهم تنیده اش به تارعنکبوت ماننده بود، و چشمانش، در تاریکی باشلقی که بر سر کشیده بود، به دو تکه جواهر براق پیرزن گفت: «سنش کمتر از چیزی که هست به نظر میآید، نه جسیکا؟» صدایش تودماغی بود و مانند بالیستِ کوک نشده وزوز میکرد؛ مادرِ «پل» با صدایی ملایم و بم پاسخ داد: «در خاندان آتریدیز رشد دیررس معمول است، حضرت والا.»؛ پیرزن وزوزکنان گفت: «بله شنیده ام، شنیده ام. با این حال...؛ جداً پانزده سالش شده؟»؛ «بله، حضرت والا.»؛ پیرزن گفت: «بیدار است؛ دارد به حرفهایمان گوش میدهد»؛ نیشخندی زد و ادامه داد: «شیطانک مکار! البته بد نیست...؛ کمی مکر و حیله برای اشرافزادگان واجب است...؛ و اگر او واقعاً کویساتز هدراخ باشد...؛ خوب...»؛ پل چشمانش را در پناه سایه های تختخواب به اندازه ی دو شیار باریک باز کرد و به نظرش آمد که چشمان بیضی شکل براق و پرنده سانِ پیرزن نیز در پاسخْ بازتر و درخشانتر شد)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 23/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 11/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

This book was a bit of a mess with the characters, world, and plot all feeling a bit disjointed and half baked. The world, while interesting and obviously very detailed, is barely explained to the reader and relies heavily on the appendix without actually providing context in the story (with the exception of a few things like spice and the worms). These characters all felt a little flat and/or underutilized. The plot felt like two separate books, while being peppered with themes of glorifying colonialism, white saviors, and lack of agency for most of the women. Although I understand that is a product of when it was written, it still points to how there are much better works that have been written since even if they were influenced by this. I’m interested to see what they do with the movie adaptation. I’ll have a review and discussion on my channel coming up. "
30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76202320-henk,Rating 4 out of 5,"8-3-2024: part 2 was esthetically pleasing and raises interesting questions on leadership and followership, and the price of power.15-9-2021: saw the movie tonight and loved it’s esthetics and how it conveys the gravitas of the storyLike medieval (but the Islamic enlightenment version of it) times, a caste system and the oil industry imposed upon space opera, with mystical elements permeating the whole and simultaneously telling the rise of a Napoleon like hero. Dune sounds like a book that shouldn’t work, but does, in an unique, complex and compelling manner.The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him.Start of the legendI must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.The last 25% of the book was a wild ride that really upped my enjoyment of this reread, and left me impressed with the worldbuilding and boldness of Frank Herbert.But to start: Dune is a classic in the scifi field, but is quite atypical. Technological progress has stalled after a jihad against thinking machines (aka computers) and a kind of medieval society in space has emerged. An emperor reigns, planets are dished out as fiefs and mysterious sects (We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans.) follow their own paths to influence events. Some kind of social darwinism is at play, and the conviction that humanity can be massively better (or worse) is we return our attention to oneself instead of towards technology.The terms are at the start quite hard to get into, even though I know the story and remember some of them from last time reading the book. Arrakis, the Dune from the title, is an other interesting thing. This desert planet is almost a separate character (The highest function of ecology is understanding consequences), being handed to the Atreides duke and worsening a blood feud with the Harkonnens, the previous owners of the planet.It is interesting how Herbert decided to reveal the first murder plot perpetrator quite soon, showing evidently that this is a book more about ideas then tension.In general the book is biblical in language and the weight assigned to events, with foreshadowing and myths. The world feels rich and alive.The main character is Paul Atreides, the son of duke Leto. He is groomed to take on his role of leader of a major house, and by his Bene Gesserit mother Jessica (who is, for lack of a better analogy, a kind of crossing between a martial arts expert, nun and witch). There are several other retainers, who are depicted in a manner that I can only compare to The Lord of the Rings.The characters in general feel greater than life, for instance the level of perception and deduction at the dinner party is superhuman, I can only imagine because there is no advanced technology that the psychic training must somehow become more advanced and leads to the kind of casual analysis Jessica and Paul are capable of.The fall of house Atreides is still a brutal event, even if you know it is coming and feels swift and unexpected, as does Paul’s enlightenment.Predetermination versus free willA kind of Heisenberg indeterminacy intervened: the expenditure of energy that revealed what he saw, changed what he saw.To be fair, halfway in the book I felt a kind of lull in reading. The main characters are thrown back upon themselves and need to establish themself amongst the Freemen, Bedouin like desert folk who are much more powerful than thought.In these sections there is such a sensitivity to culture and worldbuilding, Tatooine or the Aiel of Robert Jordan are nothing compared to the depth Herbert manages to bring go Arrakis and its Freemen. So much must have been thought of but has been left out, given a richness in the world conjured that is only rivaled by Middle Earth.The scenes are intense, and well written, but in way a bit dull since the ascent of Paul to power seems assured. There is banter that is really sharp, like:“Do you trust me?”“I hear your sincerity.”And Paul is shown as doubting, self aware of his rise and what it entails, commenting on heroism and mythmaking, and the restraints to his powers: (The vision made him want to freeze into immobility, but this, too, was action with its consequences.)But the third part, especially to the end, shows real boldness by skipping two years and taking on tragic events (Grief is the price of victory), sometimes only in an indirect manner.Alia is a good example, and all the implications and struggles, guilt, she must bring with her. You feel it, it is touched upon, but never in an on the nose manner.And the development of the relationship between Stilgar and Paul also carries sadness and an awareness of the corrosive power of adoration and myth: I have seen a friend become a worshipper.The epicness of both the story and main character Paul (and a shoutout to Chani and Jessica as well) is just beyond anything. For instance somewhere near the end Paul responds the following to a warning that the galactic emperor is coming down upon him in force:""When the Emperor learns that he’ll not rest until he has you over a slow fire.""""The Emperor’s not likely to have that power over me.""Decadence as an indication of ineffectiveness and decline, while orthodoxy, returning to the core of human struggle for life, is a way out of the impasse, comes back as a theme.The actual enlightenment and power of Paul as gained by the spice is unknowable to a reader, since he operates on another level entirely. Time being a dimension, Paul transcends the three dimensions and becomes something inhuman along the way, a singularity like the technical singularity.Some minor criticism ""How could you do such a foolish thing?"" she demanded.""He is your son""Oké, what is this convenient weirding suddenly along the way?Why is count Fenring there, what does he add in anyway to the story?And how the hell does Paul get nuclear weapons all of the sudden.And as said: the second part of the book really did not speak that much to me.But in no way it can be denied that the world conjured by Dune is rich, bold and interesting, and that I very much look forward to see the movie in 2021!Bad ass quotes:She said that the mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience....and the mystery of life is not a problem to solve but a reality to experience.The concept of progress acts as a protective mechanism to shield us from the terrors of the future.But the test of a man isn’t what you think he’ll do. It’s what he actually does.The people who can destroy a thing, they control it.The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it."

32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59568642-kevin-kuhn,Rating 5 out of 5,"As a teenager, ‘Dune’ blew my mind. I fell into the story and loved all the grandiose ideas. Over time, I reread the novel at least a half dozen times and read the follow-on novels. Looking back over time, I idolize it a bit less, recognizing some flaws, but it will always have a special place in my literary heart. For me, it's still one of the very best.“A beginning is a very delicate time.”From a literary standpoint, my favorite thing is how it throws us in the middle of a universe 20,000 years in the future and makes no attempt to explain the backstory. And there is an incredibly rich backstory. There is a spacefaring Old Empire, which became corrupt and fell. There was an AI Superintelligence that enslaved mankind, only to be overthrown, itself, leaving a universe where technology is used scarcely and carefully such as human computers knows as mentats. There is the founding of the Bene Gesserit religious cult, a collection of women whose goal is to manipulate mankind towards stability and enlightenment. None of this is clearly explained in the original novel, which really pushes the reader to deep curiosity and to make many inferences. It’s this iceberg approach which gave me the most joy when reading it. “Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.""From a science fiction standpoint, it’s filled with wonderous ideas – alien creatures (sandworms), space travel, cool ornithopter craft, and of course the trippy, psychic power-inducing spice! So, despite having to infer all the intricate backstory, we do get to experience firsthand an imaginative, fully realized alien future. “He who controls the spice, controls the universe.”So, what are the flaws? Well, perhaps the biggest, which it shares with many epic western stories (Last of the Mohicans, The Last Samurai, Dances with Wolves, Avatar, etc.) is the ‘white savior’ trope. I think it’s a valid criticism, but in Dune, Paul embraces the Fremen culture and does not try to change them or tell them how to live. This is addressed more deeply in the follow-on novels, as well. Another is treatment of women (largely - through the Bene Gesserit) as conniving and manipulative. In addition, women are used for marriage to develop alliances. Finally, one could make a case that the book explores eugenics, possibly the most problematic issue. It’s not far off from the concerns in Star Wars with midichlorians and the Skywalker bloodline. I personally find it difficult to defend any type of eugenics as an ethical plot device.“Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way for an Atreides to take the throne.”However, on the positive side, the plot has some real strengths. It’s clearly anti-colonialist and pro-environmentalist long before it was cool to be those things. It questions the powers of church and state and examines the implications of culture-clash. It examines how religion affects politics, and politics affect religion. Capitalistic greed is cast in a very ugly light. One might even call it anti-western thinking. There are strong female characters with intelligence and real power. And, through its backstory, it also examines the dangers of overreliance on technology.“The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows—a wall against the wind. This is the willow’s purpose.”Despite what your jeweler will tell you, no diamond is truly flawless. ‘Dune’ remains a masterpiece, in scale, ideas, and storytelling. It’s not perfect, but it’s influential and entertaining. Five sand blown stars for this epic, complex, and well-told masterpiece."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407364-luffy-oda-s-version,Rating 2 out of 5,"Dune is a disappointment, given the recent hype due to the upcoming movie. It's aged really badly. People everywhere are reading the book, and I wonder if they see what I realised when I reread it.The book is an ego massage to the writer, Frank Herbert. He wrote his best book never knowing the - bad - influence it would have over the sci fi scene. I think Dune is overrated and bloated.I gave the book 5 stars on my first read of it. The reread sank any adulation I might have professed to the book. The movie is going to flop, unless, i.e. the covid factor messes with the numbers. Go ahead, movie Dune. Go claim your fetid throne in the landscape of films, just as book Dune did for books. See if I care."

35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17295220-alexa,Rating 3 out of 5,"Welcome to Unpopular Review Time! Where I go against what almost everyone else says about a book.Before we start, please do not be fooled by the three star rating. Even if I didn't like really like the book, I have to acknowledge there are reasons why Dune is a cornerstone of the Sci Fi genre. Now, let's talk about the important stuff.This is a masterpiece of world building.We get a new planet, and while it's obvious that Herbert based his desert planet on real sights and cultures, it's still awesome. The Fremen and their culture, the stillsuits, the worms, the plight for water... It's all explained in such a vivid detail without being boring or repetitive. And while reading you can see the references! Can we talk about how many movies and books have been influenced by this?We also get a future Empire where machines are no longer used for computation purposes. Instead, humans have been trained to unlock their full brain potential and make such calculations. And we get two schools of these ""enhanced"" humans: the Bene Gesserit and the Mentats. And we get lots of details explaining this new society: the Empire, the Noble Houses, the Guild, how each group interacts with the others, the intrigue surrounding all dealings... The plot is straightforward and follows a 'Chosen One' pattern. Paul, is the 'Chosen One', the Lisan al-Gaib, the Kwisatz Haderach. He gets many names. After a betrayal, he finds refuge among the Fremen and seeks revenge from those who wronged his house. Here comes my first problem with the book, you can divide it in a before and after around the betrayal point. (I'm not spoiling anything by telling you this, believe me, the book will tell you ALL about it) Before this the plot drags along at a slow and unpleasant pace (at least for me.) The story is told in a third person omniscient point of view, and the author uses this liberally, giving us a peek into the different characters' thoughts. And he loves repeating ideas. So we get to know about the betrayal from the bad guy who planned it, from the traitor himself, from everyone inside House Atreides who knows that there's a traitor and suspects everyone,... and all this before anything actually happens! When the scene finally rolls in I was so tired of the plot I almost gave up on the book.After this the plot actually picks up and there's lots of action. However I had some more problems with it, as I'll explain ahead.While they were all artfully created and developed; there's no way to connect with any of these characters.The way Herbert planned his 'Chosen One' and his society, most of the characters are deeply logical and, dare I say, stuffy? They think and re-think, and plan and plot, and think again, computing everything with a very small dose of humanity. (Ha! And they call themselves humans.) Paul is wise beyond his years, not only by his training, but by his evolution during the story. It made me think of another chosen child: Harry Potter, but where we all wanted to be Harry, or at least one of his friends; I really had no thought of befriending this one. (I did pity him a lot.)And then there's the bad guy! Oh Gods. I've never in my life seen such a TERRIBLE antagonist and I don't say this lightly. He's a fat ugly guy, who cannot even move himself. He's a pedophile, a slave worker, treats everyone horribly including his own family. There is absolutely no redeeming quality to this guy. He's almost cartoonish in how bad he is. And I never ever got his hate for the Atreides, I can understand greed, personal vendettas, house wars. But his hate seemed too personal and at the same time too huge to be understandable. Also, he was the typical movie villain that loved to rehash his plots over and over again, and brag about how cunning he was. Complete freaking waste of time.Last, but not least. The ending is incredibly abrupt and I DID NOT like it. Call me romantic, call me naive, call me soft. I don't care. I thought that last paragraph was the wrong thing to say. All in all this was a great book, but it wasn't my cup of tea. I suggest you read it. If only so you can see Star Wars in a pretty different light. ---Image Credits'The Defeat of the Sarduakar' by John Schoenherr.""Fremen of Dune"" by Sammy Hall ""Vladimir Harkonnen"" by a-hour"
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matt-quann,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’ve been sitting at this keyboard for longer than I care to admit trying to coalesce my thoughts about Dune into something coherent. You already know it’s fantastic though, right? Dune is one of those novels that is spoken of in reverential tones by seasoned reader and relative newbie alike. It’s considered by many to be THE best sci-fi novel of all time and Herbert’s son, Brian Herbert, rightfully calls it sci-fi’s equivalent to Lord of the Rings for inspiring all that came after its publication. So, I mean, what in the name of Shai-Hulud am I supposed to add to that?Well, I’ll begin with the story of how I came to read Dune. I’m sure that there have been ample opportunities to read the book. I can remember seeing the black-spine amidst a forest of other spines on my cousin’s bookshelf, of which I had free reign. Yet something always kept me from picking it up. It could have been my obsession with fantasy novels at that time with only the briefest allowances for sci-fi. Whatever the reason, the book continued to pop up. Its sliver of desert on a black background called to me from piles at used bookstores, the shelves of friends and relatives, and even on public transportation. All the same, I never got around to it.Two factors finally made the difference. The first, my well-read friend (Josh Bragg in real life, but he’s on Goodreads too!) always brought it up as one of the best books he’s ever read. He also took the opportunity to remind me to read it whenever book recommendations went flying between us and, foolishly, I kept putting him off. But I’m a sucker for a great looking book and these Penguin Galaxy sci-fi collections sealed the deal for me. Their elegant cover designs, the intros by Neil Gaiman, a selection of books I’d always been meaning to read, AND Dune was on it? I was absolutely delighted to find the book under the tree on Christmas morning and tore into it in earnest. THE TIME HAD FINALLY COMEThough it took near 200 pages to really pick up speed, the novel had me hooked from its immersive opening. Here was a world that was familiar and strange at the same time. There are elements of fantasy and religion coupled with interplanetary travel and space empires. The characters touted titles that were inscrutable at the beginning, but became part of my vocabulary before the novel’s end. The novel refused to tell me everything I needed to understand, secreting mysteries without ever outright stating them. How could I not want to know what Kwisatz Haderach meant? How could I not want to know the secrets of Arrakis? The Layers of DuneI was swept away by this novel that mixes sci-fi concepts of higher dimensions with political intrigue. Environmental change mixed with an unlimited cast of enthralling characters, and a drop of religious philosophy. Dune is a novel of the highest order: it combines entertainment with brilliant questions that pull from an incredible number of disciplines. Of course, if you just want to read a compelling tale of political plotting, murder, adventure, and discovery, you can totally do that too.In the afterword, Brian Herbert notes a conversation he had with his father about the writing and structure of Dune. Frank Herbert constructed Dune so that it would be immensely dense. Herbert wanted to create a tale that could be enjoyed on the level of the central conflict: a boy becoming a man trying to reclaim his heritage against astounding odds in a world beyond imagining. Here’s an excerpt from that afterword about the layers.Ecology is the most obvious layer, but alongside that are politics, religion, philosophy, history, human evolution, and even poetry. (Page 693 of the Penguin Galaxy Edition) The fact that the novel can be enjoyed from any number of different readings alone makes it a novel of huge significance. Dune doesn’t force you into thinking, but it invites the interested to partake in its rich metaphor and multifaceted meaning. What’s more, Herbert makes statements about his concepts, but rarely does he offer them as the only solution (barring, perhaps, an ecological viewpoint that bemoans industrialization). I dove into different fields of thought between and during readings. I contemplated elegant ideas Herbert proposes and marveled at the structure of the plot and the boundless ideas of this world.What a world it is! The world building here could fill a university course as Herbert establishes a world unlike any other, but totally believable. When I read about the stillsuit I was astonished by its creativity, but also how it imparted valuable information about the world of Arrakis. Though the sandworms scream for attention throughout the novel, equal care is given to the hierarchy of the Empire, the mystical Bene Gesserit religion, and the curiosities of culture. Herbert also seems to have invented a group of hallucinogenic compounds that are in equal parts trippy, interesting, and betray an interesting look at 1960s culture.Dune drew me in and took me for a ride that I never wanted to get off.Of course, when the ride does end, it is immensely satisfying. Dune ends leaving unanswered questions in a fashion that made me feel like I knew enough to be entirely contented. Which, of course, begs the question: will I read the other Dune novels? Welllllllllllllllll, maybe. It’s highly daunting to look at the entire Dune Chronicles and think that I would tackle that. Especially when Dune ends in a way that makes me so happy, and especially when the subsequent novels purportedly deliver diminishing returns. For now, I’m too overjoyed and impressed by Dune to consider returning to the world anytime soon other than to re-read the novel.Obviously, I can’t recommend Dune enough. That’s also not a recommendation that goes to the sci-fi crowd alone. Oh no, this is a book that has great appeal to a wide variety of people. You like A Song of Ice and Fire? Perfect: you’ll love the backstabbing, the plots-within-plots, the combat, the story. You don’t read sci-fi? No worries: there’s a wealth of important themes upon which to reflect. You like sci-fi, your friends continuously recommend you read Dune, and you keep putting it off?Goodreadians, I think you know what you need to do!"
37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33610695-christopher-paolini,Rating 5 out of 5,"Dune is one of the best examples of the hero’s journey in fiction. Most authors, myself included, need more than one book in order to tell an epic coming-of-age story. Herbert did it in one while also creating a unique and interesting setting. Part of his genius as an author was his ability to imply far more about his world than he actually showed. As a result, Dune feels as if it was written by an inhabitant of Herbert’s universe; no small achievement.As with Anna Karenina, Dune goes beyond the usual surface elements that so much of fiction relies upon. It deals with questions of leadership, ecology, and philosophy (and so much more) while also telling a darn good story.And it contains one of my favorite quotes:“I must not fear.Fear is the mind-killer.Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.I will face my fear.I will permit it to pass over me and through me.And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.Only I will remain.”The book does have some flaws (the death of Muad’Dib’s son is dealt with too quickly, and the only homosexual character is the villain), but even with them, Dune is a masterpiece."
38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1205220-matt,Rating 5 out of 5,"Like most of my five star books, I’ve read Dune multiple times. In fact, I’d say that what makes a book more than just enjoyable and instead truly amazing is that you want to read it more than once and are rewarded for doing so. I’ve probably read Dune six times, and I’ve never gotten tired of it but my understanding of the work has increased over time.To begin with, the first time I read Dune, I got about three pages into it, realized I didn’t understand a thing and that I was hopelessly confused. I had to go back and reread what I had read, and then go back again and reread the whole chapter. I would excuse myself by saying that I was 10, but I’m sure I’m not the only one that has had that experience. Don’t be dismayed if it happens to you - whether 10, 18, or 45. If you are confused at first, consider that Paul is also confused and finds so much that happens strange and new. Understanding will come in its proper time.At one time at least, there was a fairly famous website (at least among geeks) that humorously summarized books in thirty words or less. Maybe it still exists, but its name escapes me. The summary provided for Dune read something like this, “I’m Frank Herbert and I’m a lot smarter than you are.” When I was younger, this would have seemed a fair appraisal of the work. One of the most central aspects of ‘Dune’ is Herbert manages to write convincingly about people whose intelligence is supposed to vastly exceed that of the reader. More than anything, to create a believable Messianic story, the writer has to create a Messiah possessing believable Messianic wisdom and insight, and Herbert succeeds at this invention probably better than any other writer. We come to believe that the protagonists do have deep and profound insight into the question of ‘Life, the Universe, and Everything’ so that we do not immediately feel cheated and we are able to believe in the characters – even someone like Maud’Dib. As I’ve gotten older, and hopefully wiser, I’ve come to see that Herbert is not in fact possessed of superhuman intelligence, but that he creates the illusion of superhuman intelligence by a variety of clever devices. The appearance of a superhuman intelligence and wisdom is really a sham and the pool is really pretty shallow, but even this revelation does not reduce the esteem in which I hold the work. It’s not Herbert’s real job to be a prophet: he’s an artist. Herbert succeeds brilliantly in what he should be judged on – the ability to paint the illusion deftly and convincingly. If we acquire the sophistication to see through it, it shouldn’t reduce our appreciation of the artistic mastery used in creating it. I think now I would amend the summary of the work to be, “I’m Frank Herbert, and I’m a lot better writer than you are.”If all that could be said in Dune’s favor was that it had one of the most convincing invented prophets in literature, it would still be a worthwhile work. But Dune has abundant pleasures beyond the richly realized illusion of philosophical depth and even the deftly realized setting. Chief among these for me is the truly deep and intricate relationships Paul has with the other characters. There is a real depth of feeling here, and I love the way each of the complicated nuanced relationships is portrayed as we are introduced to the cast of Paul’s complicated life. Each character feels a deep mixture of feelings for Paul who is boy, man, friend, soldier, sovereign, and Messiah and much else. There is tenderness to this work. We sense that complexity and tenderness right from the start, when his mother allows him to be tortured and to face murder, and then immediately thereafter experiences profound hope and joy: “My son lives.” We feel Paul’s boyish love for his friends and companions, who are also his father’s henchmen and his teachers and who he is in turn their future Lord. We feel the more mature manly love that these companions have for their young charge and future ruler. Even Yueh loves the boy he must destroy. We feel the boyish admiration Paul has for his father as he strains to be worthy of him and to make his father proud, and we feel the returned pride and satisfaction that his father feels. We feel the aching love of a boy for this Mother when he has already lost everything else when Jessica is buried in sand, and we feel her returned love when she says, “I knew you would find me.”And though there love is only briefly on stage, still I find the love between Paul and Chani among the sweetest and most charming in literature. Who cannot thrill when scarcely knowing each other, but seeing their lives together stretching out before them both good and terrible, the young becoming but not yet lovers promise with tender vows nonetheless to be forever each other's comfort and joy and they feel their hitherto unseen future becoming a real solid now. Isn’t that how it is in some way for all of us when we meet the one who will be the one and we suddenly realize we want to and we will spend the rest of our lives together regardless of what will happen? And how often have we felt the total unabashed joy as Paul does when we know our lover is now near?“That could only mean Chani was near by—Chani, his soul, Chani his sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries of the deep south.”All that and ‘Dune’ is a wonderful exciting action adventure story filled with thrills and chases, fights and battles, and supersized edge of our imagination wonders. Worms.It’s no wonder that this is one of the best beloved books of all time. If you haven’t read it, you should. If you have read it, read it again."
39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45198798-leynes,Rating 5 out of 5,"I MEAN ... WHERE THE FUCK DO I REALLY EVEN START??? It's been a long time since I've been sucked into a FANTASY / SCI-FI world and didn't wanna leave it. Early examples of that happening include Potter, the Ink world and Lord of the Rings (first through the movies, and later the books). In recent years, it has only happened with A Song of Ice and Fire and The Kingkiller Chronicles – two unfinished series ... a fate that DUNE, unfortunately, shares. [Can you hear me screaming all across the universe, Frank???] Anyways, I stopped reading fantasy and sci-fi for the simple reason that I was no longer excited by it. I read so much from these genres over my young adolescence (most notably fantasy ... sci-fi was never really my thing) that it felt right to ""move on"" at one point. I never regretted it, and rarely look back. BUT when I saw DUNE in theatres, I felt a like an excitable kid again. That movie had me hooked. From the first minute on, I knew I would be going on one hell of a ride. I saw the film with my best friend and we both couldn't believe what we had just witnessed. Cinema history akin to Lord of the Rings (or at least that's how I imagine the people who got out of the cinema back in the early 2000s). This is a FRANCHISE that one can work with. This is something that will stick with us for the next couple of years, especially if they make TWO more movies (instead of just one). DUNE didn't have that typical sci-fi feel (...my only reference point is Star Wars tho, lmao). It felt much more like Game of Thrones set in space. What drives DUNE forward is not its setting and all of the space travel, it's the political intrigue.
As someone once observed, given the right lever you can move a planet.
When Duke Leto Atreides gets the order from the Padisha Emperor Saddam IV to replace his cousin, the Baron Harkonnen, as ruler of the planet Arrakis (also known as DUNE), he knows that that's not a gift. The Emperor is intimidated by Leto's power and that he's held in high esteem by the other Higher Houses of the universe. And therefore Leto (along with the other Atreides) must be stopped. What then ensues is an exhilarating and complex net of plots which focuses on the all encompassing question of power. What makes a good ruler? Who is ""allowed"" to rule? What about the people who are ruled?I didn't expect DUNE to be as psychological and philosophical as it was ... even though I heard it gets even more META throughout the rest of the series (CAN'T WAIT!). At the heart of the story, we follow Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto, as he moves with his parents and their entourage from Caladan to Arrakis.
""It is said a man will come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye. He will look where we cannot - into both feminine and masculine pasts... Many men have tried the drug... so many, but none has succeeded.""""They tried and failed, all of them?""""They tried and died.""
Paul was trained throughout his young life (he is 15 at the beginning of the book) by his mother, Lady Jessica, in her Bene Gesserit ways. The Bene Gesserit are a pseudo-religious organization of all-women spies, nuns, scientists, and theologians who use genetic experimentation, galactic political interference, and religious engineering to further their own agenda of ascending the human race with the advent of their chosen one, the Kwisatz Haderach. Paul struggles with the burden his mother has chosen for him. He knows that there is no such thing as ""the chosen one""; it's a farce, a manipulation – and yet something he can't escape. Not gonna lie, I had my problems with Herbert's writing throughout the first third of the book. I have never read something quite like it. I know lots of people had problems with the rich world building in DUNE because Herbert tends to throw hundreds of terms (unique to his world) around without any explanation for them in the text; but having seen the movie BEFOREHAND (something I would highly recommend) made it SUPER EASY for me to picture everything and follow along. No, the problem I had was the actual WRITING STYLE. At first, it felt really clunky and ... just weird? Like, not literary at all? I know I'm doing a piss poor job at explaining it but at first I felt like I was reading a weird fanfiction of the movie (LMAO). But when I got used to the writing and accepted it for what it is, I got reeeeaally lost in the book. And was actually amazed at how MODERN??? the writing felt. Like, DUNE could've literally been written in the 21st century. The writing definitely didn't feel OLD, even though it felt WEIRD in some parts. :DAnyways, I finished DUNE within three days (which is a feat for me ... the book is almost 700 pages long and I usually only read 50 pages a day). It was a true page turner, especially two-thirds into the book – when we finally got to the part of the story that wasn't shown in the movie – I was glued to the pages. I couldn't believe what was happening. All the twists and turns were just AMAZING. And the ending was puurrrfect. [I really like that DUNE can be read as a standalone ... especially since I don't feel like committing to a 6-book-series that isn't even finished and literally 20+ extra novels that Herbert's son wrote to broaden the universe.]DUNE is not a book I'd recommend to just anyone. You must have an appetite for it. You must be willing to forgive its author a couple of things for full enjoyment (like the role of women in the story, and that there are very few female characters to begin with; or Herbert's homophobia which comes through in his portrayal of the Baron Harkonnen). If you can't do that, you won't have a fun time. But if you really WANT to go on this journey, then DUNE will hold many adventures and purse-clutching moments for you.FAVORITE QUOTE: THE LITANY OF FEAR ""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.""I WANNA TALK ABOUT SOME THINGS I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IN THE SECOND MOVIE AND EVERYTHING THAT I LEARNED THROUGH READING THIS BOOK, SO – SPOILER WARNING – PROCEED WITH CAUTION:- from the introduction: the Bene Gesserit have secret computers to keep track of their breeding records??? when will this come into play?? and what is the significance of this??- Castle Caladan served the Atreides family as home for 26 (!) generations- Faufreluches class system: The faufreluche system was meant to provide some sort of order for the way in which humanity related with one another, both to maintain order and civility, and to keep certain groups under control within the Imperium. However, it attempted to minimise alienation of individuals or minorities by providing for everyone: The motto of the faufreluche system was ""A place for every man and every man in his place."" - Butlerian Jihad: a.k.a. The Great Revolt -- two generations of chaos (200 BG - 108 BG). The god of machine-logic was overthrown by the masses and a new concept was raised: ""Man may not be replaced.""- Orange Catholic Bible: It was supposed to be a fusion of all significant religious thought in human history, with a strong emphasis on religious beliefs originating on Earth. These included the Maometh Saari, Mahayana Christianity, Zensunni Catholicism, and Budislamic traditions. It was produced by the Commission of Ecumenical Translators in the wake of the Butlerian Jihad. Its supreme commandment was: ""Thou shalt not disfigure the soul."" - The Spacing Guild: The Spacing Guild, also known as the Guild of Navigators, or more simply the Guild, was an organization which held exclusive access to faster than light space travel. The Guild monopoly on space travel and transport and upon interstellar banking is taken as the beginning point of the Imperial Calendar. - the reason Gurney hates the Harkonnens so much is that his younger sister is held captive in one of their pleasure houses- on Arrakis live the Fremen and the people of the graben, the sink, and the pan - Paul has Mentat capabilities - the Duke ""bought"" Lady Jessica??? - crysknife will disintegrate if it's more than a week away from flesh => people with a crysknife may never leave Arrakis without the Fremen's consent - Dr. Yueh's motivation is so much better in the book than in the movie: he just wants to kill the Baron, he KNOWS that his wife is dead (in the movie he felt like such a fool) - the Atreides' raid on Giedi Prime, destroying the Baron's spice stores => EXCELLENT!- The Fremen are paying the Guild for privacy (paying with spice) => the Guild therefore forbids satellites over Arrakis ... bc the Fremen slowly want to change the face of Arrakis (make it a green planet) - DUNE is a great lesson on climate change, looking at the conditions of Arrakis, especially in regards to the water scarcity and the extreme weather, it is a bleak (but realistic) look into the future ... especially since Herbert stresses that this is man-made and could've been prevented had people (CAPITALISM) not seen more value in the resource of spice than in an actual liveable green planet - I CANNOT (written in the 60s, ladies and gentlemen, yet more accurate than ever) - ""He recalled another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of many things—the people, the dirt, the growing things, the moons, the tides, the suns—the unknown sum called nature, a vague summation without any sense of the now.""- Muad'Dib: The Mouse (Paul's chosen Fremen name but also a constellation from the Arrakeen sky)- Once you're addicted to spice, you need it to live => you literally can't leave Arrakis without spice (or else you'd die) - LADY JESSICA IS BARON HARKONNEN'S DAUGHTER (I YELLED WHEN THAT WAS REVEALED) - the conditioning of a Suk School: Imperial Conditioning was a development of the Suk Medical Schools. It was the highest conditioning against taking human life, which meant that a Suk Doctor who had this conditioning could even serve an Emperor. - Stilgar and Liet Kynes are brothers => Liet Kynes is Chani's father!!!- The Fremen storing all of that fucking water in these caches (I NEED TO SEE THAT ON SCREEN) => they literally have thousands of caches with 38 million decaliters of water - I CANNOT - Paul realising: My mother is my enemy. She does not know it, but she is. She is bringing the jihad. She bore me; she trained me. She is my enemy. - But how does this come into play??? I feel like there wasn't that much tension between the two???- Feyd-Rautha and the gladiator => cannot wait to see that fight (also love that Thufir Hawat is being held captive by the Baron) - Lady Fenring seducing Feyd-Rautha ... having a child with him??? => bc she knows it's the only way to SAVE THAT BLOODLINE (so the Fenrings knew that the Baron, Beast Rabban and Feyd-Rautha would all be killed??? how??) - The Water of Life: the liquid exhalation of a dying sandworm (poisonous) - the whole ceremony for Jessica becoming the Reverend Mother of Stilgar's people ... this will be a wild trip in the movie!- Alia being the weirdest. baby. ever. => love that for her!- Chani seeing her future with Paul in the post-ceremony trance/orgy/whateverthefuck (seeing young Leto - their son) and then just being like YUP YOU'RE THE ONE FOR ME LET'S START FUCKING is such a mood - Salusa Secundus: the Emperor's prison planet; mortality rate among new prisoners is more than 60%; this is where he gets his Sardaukar - Paul seeing that he will enshrine the skull of his father in a Fremen rock mound overlooking Harg Pass => WHY THOOOO???? my man??- Fremen ride the sandworms beginning at age 12- Gurney (who became a smuggler after the attack on House Atreides) finally reuniting with Paul after YEARS - I was soft!!!! - Paul, even after all the years with the Fremen saying: ""I am House Atreides."" Whew, chile- Paul drowning the maker to see if he is the real Kwisatz Haderach => THIS MAN NEEDS TO CHILLL!!!!- Paul having power over the Spacing Guild (and the Emperor) because he has the power of the spice => he threatens to kill all makers (sandworms) and therefore extinguish the spice - Paul's son dying at Baron Harkonnen's hands (and Alia being captive) => I wasn't prepared for THAT- ALIA HAS NO FUCKING CHILL AND I LOVE HER VERY MUCH - Paul using Princess Irulan as his key to the throne - I HATE IT HERE (I hope she gets back at him in future books ... the way he treats her is APPALLING!!!) - Count Fenring had never appeared in Paul's prescient visions => having read the beginning of DUNE MESSIAH I suppose that is because he is one of the SPACING GUILD????? what the fuck? bc it is revealed that they are exempt from all visions (maybe bc they are not really male or female??) - Paul: ""The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control over it.""- Paul getting back at Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam (""Try your tricks on me, old witch. Where's your gom jabbar? Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You'll find me there staring out at you."" => WHAT THE FUCK??? THAT WAS SO EPIC???) ALSO: ""I remember your gom jabbar. You remember mine. I can kill you with a word."" AHHHHHHHHH- The Jihad being inevitable- Last sentence, Jessica consoling Chani: ""While we, Chani, we who carry the name of concubine—history will call us wives."" => I know this situation with Paul-Irulan-Chani is all kinds of fucked up BUT THAT WAS EPIC"
40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey,Rating 3 out of 5,"Epic and highly inventive, but not nearly as great as I remember it being. I think Herbert's writing really gets in the way of the story. He continuously tells the reader what each character is thinking through italicized internal dialogue. Sometimes uses the third person narration to do the same thing in a more elegant way. The problem is that he does both, often times for the same character in the same paragraph. It's super clunky, and took me out of the story every time."

Solo estaré yo""Primera relectura 2024: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Dune es el libro que ha marcado mi inicio de viaje en la CF. Abriéndome así las puertas a un género que ha conseguido toda mi atención. Un viaje sin duda apasionante. Me ha hecho sentir como un niño abriendo un regalo y descubriendo un nuevo camino como lector en la CF. Consigue lo que todo libro y autor puede aspirar, ser memorable en el tiempo y en la memoria del lector que lo disfrutó. No puedo ponerle menos de cinco estrellas a esta joya.La importancia de Dune creo que a día de hoy es indiscutible. Se considera como el que sentó las bases de la ciencia ficción moderna. Lo que Frank Herbert logró en su libro es sorprendente porque logró construir un mundo fascinante con una ambientación muy detallada que logra sumergirte en el propio desierto de Arrakis. Pero es que no solo esto ya que la política, la economía, las luchas de poder, la religión, la ecología, la supervivencia y las estrategias logra que no solo sean importantes en la trama sino que sean incorporados de manera muy eficiente a la historia. Página tras página me fue demostrando la pasión que le puso a su obra y el derroche de imaginación e ideas que tenía en su mente. El libro se publicó en 1965 y fue rechazado previamente por muchas editoriales. Las cuáles en ese momento y hoy, se deben arrepentir mucho xD.""¿Qué es lo que desprecias? Por ello serás conocido""Tenemos una historia atemporal que trata sobre en lo que se ha convertido y como vive el ser humano. Seguimos a unos personajes muy interesantes que cumplen diversos roles o en algunos casos, destinos. Tenemos un montón de intrigas, sociedades de estrategia ya sea militar, política o religiosa pero sobretodo trata sobre la supervivencia en el planeta, Arrakis. Donde la riqueza, la verdadera riqueza, se cuenta en la cantidad de agua que uno posee. Una historia sobre lo que conlleva crear un profeta. Una sociedad muy compleja y complicada en la que la tecnología es algo importante, en algunos casos esencial para la vida. Un mundo muy detallado que se ve diferente pero al mismo tiempo similar al nuestro. Consigue que vivas lo que están pasando los personajes y sus pensamientos. Su brillante ambientación con todos sus paisajes se sienten con total vividez, es un deleite absoluto para la vista o mejor dicho como lectores, para la imaginación. Consigue transportarte al desierto y las dunas de Arrakis.Para mi este es el mayor logro del libro por parte de su autor, pasar las páginas y sentir que estás ahí, imaginar todo lo que te rodea cada grano de arena, cada roca, los gusanos y lo que supone vivir ahí. La constante importancia que se le da al agua en las páginas, tu propia mente la refleja dándote y a mi me pasó, sed.""¿Qué es el hijo, sino la extensión del padre?""El planeta Arrakis me fascinó. Sus desiertos, sus dunas y sus gusanos. Un mundo que curiosamente a pesar de generar la substancia más preciada del universo su bien más preciado es el agua. Que se lo digan a sus habitantes, los indomables Fremen. Una sociedad cuya forma de vida los ha endurecido con curiosas pero lógicas costumbres que se basan en la adoración de un bien que escasea y es fundamental para la supervivencia, es su moneda, el agua. Un bien muy preciado, el agua es vida y aquí todavia mas debido a la escasez y la valoran por encima de todo. Esto forma los pilares en los que componen a su sociedad por ejemplo; si lloraras a un muerto o escupes es considerado una señal de gran respeto para ellos, ya que significa perder agua corporal. En Arrakis se utilizan destiltrajes, una compleja y brillante vestimenta que absorve cada gota de agua que sale del cuerpo y la convierte en agua potable para que el portador del destiltraje pueda volver a beberla. Uno podría decir asqueroso. Pero si vives en Arrakis lo necesitarás y agradecerás desesperadamente beber. ""La proximidad de una cosa deseable hace tender a la indulgencia. Ahí acecha el peligro""Tenemos un repertorio de personajes que muestran cierta profundidad. Complejos, bien construidos y perfilados. Pero sobretodo muy humanos, pues se mueven por el poder, la religión y sobretodo por la supervivencia. Lo que más flojea para mi son los personajes secundarios. Si bien es cierto que no tienen el mismo peso que los principales sí los he notado más de adorno, les falta mostrar algo de complejidad y atracción al leer. Principales como los que componen la casa Atreides, aquellos que luchan por ellos con lealtad hacía su duque y algunos de los indómitos Fremen. Tenemos villanos, como principal yo diría el Barón Harkonen, enemigo de la casa Atreides y un maestro de las intrigas, consigue lo que se propone sin que nada se interponga y es un ser bastante despreciable. Con estos personajes obtenemos unos diálogos trabajados, cargados de grandes citas. Citas dignas de marcar.Tenemos profecías, peleas, armas, sociedades, gusanos de arena y tecnología que aún no siendo un lector experimentado en el género, yo creo que quizás no conste de tantos elementos tecnológicos o términos como en otras obras de CF ya que me pareció más una mezcla de espada/fantasía/CF. Hay momentos con cierta epicidad, cargados de emoción, momentazos que consiguen representar la esencia de lo que es Dune y como lector me he quedado sorprendido. En la historia hay humanos con ciertas habilidades especiales. Aunque yo diría que la inteligencia en especial con las estrategias es la mayor o la más importante habilidad/arma que se da en el libro. Los personajes le aportan mucho a la trama y encajan en ella a la perfección, captan el interés del lector queriendo o incluso necesitando pasar las páginas para saber lo que pasará a continuación, las estrategias y decisiones que ejecutarán y el desenlace.""Cualquier camino, si se sigue hasta el fin, no conduce exactamente a ningún lugar. Escalad tan sólo un poco la montaña para comprobar si es una montaña. Desde la cima de la montaña, no podréis ver la montaña""Como punto negativo para mi ha sido el final. Me dio la sensación de que se precipitaba un poco, me hubiera gustado que tuviera más páginas porque algunos momentos del desenlace me parecieron un poco bruscos, pasan muchas cosas en el último momento. El desenlace es casi ambiguo, un medio abierto medio cerrado. Se dan respuestas y puedes quedarte ahí y no continuar, pero también queda algún interrogante. Añadir que al inicio de cada capítulo hay pequeños fragmentos que quizás se comprendan mejor con una segunda lectura. Dune es una joya que perdurará en el tiempo y en la mente de los lectores que lo hemos disfrutado. Ha marcado mi inicio en la CF y ahora contemplo con gratitud y una gran emoción lo que me espera en este género. Ahora me entraron ganas de mirar las películas, la vieja y la nueva cuando se estrene.""La más alta función de la ecología es la comprensión de las consecuencias"""

Update March 2024:
 Just bumping this mini-review to say I'm pleased with Villeneuve's adaptation for how he handled my Dune favourites. Feyd-Rautha has been done justice at long last, the trauma from the cringe yellow-pants Sting is over, the honour of House Harkonnen has been restored. _______________________________The start is one of the slowest beginnings I've found, and the writing could be much better than the rather basic prose Herbert exhibits, but the storyline and the setting are quite good once one gets past the first ""book"" in the this first installment of the Dune saga. I enjoyed the plot and the worldbuilding a bit more than the characters, though I did like the villains more too, and am left interested enough to want to eventually continue with the rest to see how the story of the Atreides family will pan out."

But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.”Dune follows Paul Atreides, Duke of a noble family on the inhospitable planet of Arrakis. the main source of power comes in the form of Spice— a drug that can enhance consciousness while also extending lifespans. there’s multiple pov’s: Paul, his mother Jessica, the rival families the Harkonnens and Fenrings, along with the desert people called Fremen. they all have separate motives and act accordingly to their respective plans to gain power. there was so much i wasn’t aware of and the ending honestly pleasantly surprised me. i’m so curious to continue the books eventually and the world building was so expansive beyond what i was originally imagining.➛ Florence Pugh and Zendaya got me reading this book since the second movie was so good !! i already started listening to the audio and the full cast and sound effects ?! Ok production 🤌🏽 i highly recommend the audiobook as it was a whole entire experience✨"

I know everyone is so SHOCKED, but I loved Dune. Actually, jokes aside, I loved it so much more than I thought I would. I've been putting off reading it for years - I was afraid that it was going to be too dated, too long, too dense, etc. I think I was also afraid I was not going to love it as much as I other people loved it, and if you've ever been underwhelmed by a cult favorite or a classic - you KNOW how much that just doesn't feel good. But even though my expectations were very high going into it, Dune ended up surpassing them. See, I actually finished the book three days ago, and I simply didn't want to mark it ""read"" because I was just letting it sit with me. You might say ""Marianna, if you loved it so much, why did you take 2 months to read it?"" This may sound silly, but this was the first book in a very long time I just didn't want to burn through. I wanted to enjoy the world, the characters, and the writing. I wanted to let myself stay in this universe instead of rushing through it. Yes, I know it's a whole series and there is more to it, but that's the feeling I had reading this novel.It's absolutely a book I can see myself reading again, and getting a lot more out of it. It's also a book I can see myself trying to force on other people. There are things within it that resonated with me more than I ever expected. There are ideas and quotes that really stuck with me. But let's also not forget that this is an amazing story and setting - a beautiful mix of sci-fi and fantasy that I so rarely see done well, and a spin on the emergence of a hero. Initially, I didn't have plans to immediately continue the series, but now I'm thinking it will happen a lot sooner than I anticipated ))P.S. As if I could have looked forward to the movie adaptation done by my favorite director more... But yea, now I REALLY can't wait to watch the film! Sadly, I doubt it will be released this year at all, considering everything that's going on. Thanks, 2020...***2021 REREADI still love it. Obviously.Even more fun after watching the movie, somehow!***2024 REREADI love it more and more every time I read it, which is crazy because I 5/5 loved it the first time I read it. Truly a sci-fi masterpiece that has something new to teach me with every read-through. Forever addicted to this spice."

Memo to Chalamet's people: Don't let anyone else cast him in a role where the reason he's there is his cheekbones. He's better than that.5/18/2019 The 1984 film is free with Prime on Amazon. With a new version being filmed right now and including some serious firepower from Director Denis Villeneuve to Timothee Chalamet as Muad'dib the Kwisatz Haderach, it seemed like a good moment for a rewatch. It truly is a gorgeous film, but really not so hot on the woke front. Surprise surprise surprise says my brain in its full Gomer Pyle mode.2/15/17: I found this 2003 mini-documentary about the 1984 film on YouTube. I wasn't wrong. The film wasn't very good. Beautiful, yes; good, not so much.***I first read this novel in 1975. It seems impossible that it was over 40 years ago, but the math is inescapable and time inexorable. My teenaged brain was rewired by the read. I had a standard by which to judge all future SFnal reads, and it was a high one. I was transported into a future I was utterly convinced would be the the one I'd have descendants to live in. I suppose that could yet happen. I'm a lot less convinced now that the human race's future is that long. Age might bring wisdom, I wouldn't know about that, but it sure brought me a booster shot of cynicism.The Orange Catholic Bible, the books of the Empress Irulan, they all seemed to me so real...the cry ""never to forgive, never to forget"" rings louder today than it did in 1975 because I've lived through so many iterations of it by now. Us people, we love the shit out of our vicious vengeful vendettas, don't we. Frank Herbert got that right as all hell.Trouble is, ol' Frank wasn't any kind of a writer, was he? He had flashes of good phrasemaking, he had long stretches of competent prosemongering, and then there was the rest of the ninety jillion words in the novel. Serviceable is le mot juste. And TBH I feel pretty generous putting it that way.But then came David Lynch. Oh dear, oh dear. I'm not a worshipper of Lynch's at the best of times. I thought Blue Velvet was brummagem and boring; Twin Peaks was portentous twaddle. So the Kool-Aid passed my seat, I fear. His 1984 adaptation of Dune was downright laughable. I left the theater torn between gales of laughter and gusts of grief-stricken tears. Sting in that stupid winged underwear! KYLE MacLACHLAN as Paul Atreides!! Ludicrous, all of it, and the problems started with the butchery of so much of the novel that even the bones were scattered in no sensible pattern. Inevitable, really, as the runtime of the film was a paltry two hours and seventeen minutes. Imagine trying to wedge a 600-page magnum opus dense with world-building and replete with internal ironies and levels of meaning into the length of a good winter's nap. Didn't work so good.SciFi Channel, gods please bless their collective hides, approved a mini-series written and directed by John Harrison in 2000. It was 4:17:07 in total. That was *almost* enough to do justice to the story. The result was infinitely superior to the Lynch version. It was a joy to watch for me, a forty-year-old cruelly wounded mess of a man, and felt like a balm to my fanboy memory of the novel. Perfect? No. Great? Yep!Then I found it on YouTube (of course it's since been deleted) and thought I'd take a respite from reality by giving it a rewatch. You know what? Special effects age badly. Mid-budget TV ones age really, really, really badly. The screenplay clunked a good deal. The story, however, was all there and was well done, with the prunings and bonsai sculptings well chosen and well shaped. And the story was just about as timely as anything I could've hoped to avoid!Dune bashed me upside the temples with its portrayal of the collapse of Empire and revolution of the have-nots in a way it couldn't have 17 or 42 years ago. It felt more timely, it packed more wallop than it possibly could have in fatter times. This is my idea of good myth-making: A story that isn't finished telling us the truth yet, and doing so in a way that compels, impels, propels us to go on the journey ready or not. The idea of a Savior come to rescue us is eternally appealing, the sight of the unworthy getting their comeuppance is evergreen. It wasn't what I was seeking, wasn't escapist boom-bang-blowwie, but it was what I needed. A bit of heartening to fight again, odds be buggered.And now I'm told that there's a new version on the way, possibly to be directed by Denis Villeneuve of Arrival fame. That's some fire-power there. A director with clout and access to Hollywood's cash box could do something special with this epic...though I'm still very concerned with the issues inevitable in adapting the story to movie length. Isn't it interesting how every decade seems to call for a new version of the story? The 1960s had the novel; the 1970s the unmade Alejandro Jodorowsky adaptation, a perfect reflection of the decade's malaise/limitation mentality; the 1980s cheesy, overblown one-note-and-it's-the-wrong-one ethos; the 1990s void, again perfectly in keeping with the culture; the 2000s TV version, as everything shrunk in the aftermath of the floodwaters of Bush's election stealing; and now a big-budget, major-talent remake! That hasn't happened yet! And bids fair not to, in the parlous economic times ahead!Frank Herbert's Dune is a great rewatch. The novel hasn't finished with us yet. I hope it won't any time soon."

And then their body is found two weeks later at the bottom of a lake.This book . I don't usually come out and give such brutally negative reviews, but my god. If I ruled the world, I would ban this book for the sheer sake of how awful it is.People say Tolkien's prose was a struggle to read through, but at least his style of writing was intentionally made to be fashioned after an Arthurian epic. Frank Herbert just writes like a... Hell, I dont even know what he writes like. You could put a million monkeys in front of a million typewriters and have them hammer keys until the end of time, and the monkey who wrote this would look at the abomination he had created and throw himself off a cliff. Frank Herbert didn't even have the shame to do that.The pacing, the characters, the overall plotline, the miraculous events that seem to happen at just the right time, the awful dialogue, and the Mary Sue that is Paul Atreides simply boggles the mind.I read this book because I thought there must be some redeeming quality somewhere at the end. Some glorious stroke of genius that somehow rescues the story from the fiery hell that is Frank H's staggeringly atrocious storytelling. But there wasn't. It ended, and that was several hours of my life I would never get back.I exaggerated this review a lot more than was necessary for my own entertainment. But it's no lie that I had more fun writing this review than reading this book. -1/5. "

I'm going to leave the issues alone (Obviously, there are issues. 1965 was a long time ago).Mostly, I can see why this book is a beloved classic and why it's been so inspirational.

51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92694579-nicholas-perez,Rating 4 out of 5,"Video review is now up!Read for my resolution to read classical sci-fi.One of the classics of sci-fi and the best-selling sci-fi (in paperback), Dune is about the young Paul Atreides after his father Duke Leto is given control of the desert planet Arrakis by the emperor. However, there is a traitor plotting the downfall of the Atreides family and when the betrayal is finally enacted, Duke Leto dies and Paul and his Bene Gesserit mother, Lady Jessica, are thrown into the desert wildlands of the Fremen people. There, Paul learns about the spice, Arrakis' most covenanted product, the Fremen people and their prophecy of the one to come and save them.But is Paul really a hero?It took me quite a bit of time to read Dune. It is a very complex novel with a lot of things going, characters with many motivations, and many warnings about hero worship and the way the environment has influence on people. Let's go ahead and focus on the elephant(s) in the room: the dialogue, the portrayal of women, and the colonialism thing.The dialogue isn't as terrible as I thought it would be. Yes, there are some characters with weird dialogue like Piter, the Baron, Thufir Hawat, and Gurney Halleck. Everyone else was mostly fine; Lady Jessica was kind of a middle ground. The dialogue flowed a bit strange at times and the characters' mental reactions to certain statements often sounded like a computer talking. But other than that, fine.The women of Dune. Those who have not read Dune are probably unaware that the story is partially narrated, or at least partially described, by Princess Irulan the daughter of the emperor and a Bene Gesserit. Irulan's excerpts reveal her omniscience, but also reveal how she knew Paul was not the hero everyone initially thought him to be. Lady Jessica I felt very conflicted about. She certainly could outsmart several people, especially men, as a result of her Bene Gesserit training. However, at times Lady Jessica seemed like the stereotypical overemotional motherly figure that has been featured in many stories, not just sci-fi. Jessica and Gurney have a debate on being emotional versus being very logical; an argument that readers will soon learn is not just on page. It feels kind of essentialist to make Jessica the emotional one and Gurney the logical one, that whole ""women are emotional and men are logical"" thing. At one point Jessica is so emotional that she fails to see that Dr. Yueh is the traitor just as he's about to tell her. On the other hand, Gurney gets so logical he fails to see how emotions play into humans' actions and decision. I don't think Jessica is the worst depiction, because she is very strong and smart, but still it feels stereotypical.And Chani, Paul's Fremen lover. To be honest, Chani was just kind of there. She was certainly strong given her Fremen upbringing, but her impact on the story was not as much as I had been led to believe. She is certainly a motivational factor for Paul, but beyond that not much else.Alia was probably the best female character. Innocent yet calculating in her thoughts and actions. I am so glad that Frank Herbert didn't kill her off in the final cut, though I wish we could see more of her.The Bene Gesserit are an order of psychic witch-geneticist-nun-things who have trained many of the women in the empire. They have a breeding program to create the perfect male version, the Kwisatz Haderach--whom they believe Paul to be, or at least fit the myth of the Kwisatz Haderach into Paul--, and thus have become concubines for various male rulers, like Lady Jessica, in the empire to secure and purify the line. The Bene Gesserit are responsible for many things and events within Dune, including the desiring of the spice drug and initially planting the religion among the Fremen to control them. An all-female organization with malefic intentions was not too common back when Herbert wrote this book. The Bene Gesserit are not the primal antagonists of Dune; interestingly enough, that right goes to power-hungry and corrupted men like the Baron and his nephews and the emperor. However, the fact that the Bene Gesserit are responsible for some many things and are all women makes me question the reasons. At no point in the story are women outright described as being inherently villainous, but why the Bene Gesserit like that? Who knows?As for the colonialism aspects of the story, Dune is actually pretty self-aware of this at times. It's clear that the empire and the Baron do not treat either the Fremen nor the planet well and the Fremen have every right to hate them. The book does not shy away from the Bene Gesserit's religious manipulation of the Fremen, even. One of the most important scenes in the book is Liet-Kynes' death. Before he dies, Liet-Kynes has a hallucination of his father who warns him that his support for turning Paul into a hero is one of the worse things he could've done for the Fremen and that Arrakis' environment influences people way more than they expect. A hero from the colonizers/settlers/offworlders--whatever you want to call them--cannot be a true hero for the natives of the planet, he will only doom them. However, Dune also at times enacts the ""noble savage"" archetype. The Fremen are strong and courageous, but are ultimately wildlings with a regressive and superstitious society. So close, yet so far. Okay, anyway, an actual review.Dune is actually one of the most poignant descents into villainy--tyranny?--I have ever read. The whole book is a warning about hero worship. Paul Atreides goes from being an inexperienced duke's son to Usul Muad'Dib, the messianic figure of the Fremen religion. According to his mother, he actually wasn't supposed to embody the religious aspects of the hero, and yet he does. Paul is literally a contradiction to every single other character's ideals and goals. He shows how logic and emotion and coexist in someone (Jessica and Gurney), how eliminating those you have deemed as failed is actually weakening yourself (the Baron), and how the religious superstitions you plant might have truth (Jessica and the Bene Gesserit), and how status of birth and breeding guarantees no certainty (again the Bene Gesserit). Back to the environment thing. Arrakis' rigid environment has influenced everyone and everything who has touched it. The necessity of the spice, the prominence and strength of the Fremen religion, the political arrangements--everything! This went hand in hand with Paul's rise to power. The emperor and the Baron thought they knew or could control Arrakis and cause the downfall of Atreides, but instead their misunderstanding and pride only caused the birth of a (anti-)hero. Arrakis will deal with Paul later, I'm sure. But on its own. Paul's rise was subversive. I went from expecting to fearful in such a subtle and gradual way. Dune isn't perfect. But I'll be damned if it isn't significate."
52,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32821952-phuong,Rating 3 out of 5,"– 2.5 starsSo this is one of the greatest sci-fi books of all time huh interestingI read the first 5 chapters of Dune (didn't understand shit), went to watch Dune in the cinema and then read the rest of the book and I have to say thank god for the movie. The movie made the world of Dune so much more tangible & digestable. The book throws you right into the lion's den with all these characters, places & terminology coupled with the flower writing style of Frank Herbert made it hard to follow the story. 
“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
This is suppose to be a review for the book ,but I can't help but compare it to the movie adaption and for once I actually find the movie better. Paul, Lady Jessica, the Duke and most of House Atreidis were so much more likeable in the movie (maybe that's the Timothée Chalamet effect 😌), whereas I couldn't care less about them in the book. Only my man Duncan Idaho stays superior in both book and movie. As for the villains: Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was gross in every possible scenario and that didn't change no matter the medium. That vile energy transcends everything 💀
“The mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.”
The way to consume this book is with the audiobook since it comes with full cast + sounds effect and is pretty good. Only because of the audiobook I can round up to 3 stars. It was very difficult to get into it otherwise.The following is just me wanting to insert more Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya gifs for ✨ the aesthetic ✨And lastly, a gif of me running away from all the Dune stans, because all I'm saying is that I think the movie is better than the book. Ok bye. 😇"
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe,Rating 5 out of 5,"I can't explain what attracted me to Dune--the 1965 science fiction epic by Frank Herbert, winner of the first Nebula Award and (in a tie, with This Immortal by Roger Zelazny) the Hugo Award--any better than T.E. Lawrence could explain what attracted him to the Arabian Peninsula. The book's prestige among genre fans was a factor, as were admissions by many that they read it in junior high school and found Herbert accessible. As inclined as I am towards local coffeeshops, perhaps Herbert's head space while writing the novel in Santa Rosa, California from 1959-1965 appealed to me most. I could almost smell the incense burning.The galactic intrigue begins in the year 10,191 with excerpts from writings by the Princess Irulan, daughter of the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV and a holder of literary pretensions. The princess offers some perspective at the beginning of each chapter, hipping the reader to what's happening behind the scenes. We're introduced to Paul Atreides, the 15-year-old heir of Duke Leto Atredies, a charismatic planetary governor of Caladan whose popularity among the noble houses of the universe has garnered the attention, and jealously, of the emperor. Setting a trap, he offers Leto the planet of Arrakis, the most valuable real estate in the universe.Arrakis is inhospitable to all but titanic-sized sandworms and a fierce tribe of desert dwellers known as the Fremen, but produces the priceless spice melange. In a future where mankind no longer relies on computers, the spice is a transformative agent that expands consciousness: empowering the navigators of the Spacing Guild who travel through space, the savvy Mentats who advise heads of state and the bewitching Reverend Mothers of the Bene Gesserit sect who see the future. Leaving their ancestral home on the verdant Caladan for Arrakis with Paul is his mother, the Lady Jessica, the duke's concubine and a Bene Gesserit, who is a black sheep among the Reverend Mothers.Thus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: ""The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness."" -- FROM ""MUAD'DIB, FAMILY COMMENTARIES"" BY THE PRINCESS IRULANOn moving day, Paul is visited by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Jessica's teacher, for a rite of passage and a test. The old crone confronts Jessica, who defied the Bene Gesserit order that she bear a daughter the sect intended to marry off to Feyd-Rautha, heir to the House Harkonnen, the industrious enemies of House Atredies. The Bene Gesserit believed the progeny of such a pairing would have produced the Kwisatz Haderach, a male with the power to see through space and time as they do. Jessica opted to bear Duke Leto the boy he wanted instead. The Reverend Mother sees some potential in Paul, but offers no hope his father will live to an old age. Paul's education is overseen by his father's advisors--Thufir Hawat (a Mentat), the troubadour-warrior Gurney Halleck, the swordmaster Duncan Idaho and Dr. Wellington Yueh--but mostly by the Lady Jessica, who has trained her son in Bene Gesserit meditative techniques. Arriving in the garrison town of Arrakeen, Jessica encounters a housekeeper named the Shadout Mapes who is full of Fremen superstitions, intrigued as to whether Jessica may be the One, mother to the messiah who their prophecy holds will lead their people out of slavery. After Paul saves the housekeeper's life from a Harkonnen booby trap intended for him, she confides to the boy that there is a traitor among them.Duke Leto forges an alliance with the Fremen, using imperial planetolgist Liet Kynes--who's gone native on Arrakis--as a liaison. Operating with the blessing of the Emperor and the assistance of his Sardaukur troops, the gluttonous Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his Mentat, Piter De Vries, attack Arrakeen after the traitor in the House Atredies lowers the garrison's shields for them. The Baron exiles the Lady Jessica and Paul so he can claim plausible deniability in their deaths, but mother and son find refuge with the Fremen, with the tribe's revered leader Stilgar and Kynes' daughter, Chani. Paul learns of the prophecy of Muad'Dib, the desert mouse, who the Fremen hold as their messiah. Muad'Dib could indeed see the Future, but you must understand the limits of his power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so, Muad'Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us ""The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow door."" And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course, warning ""That path leads ever down into stagnation."" -- FROM ""ARRAKIS AWAKENING"" BY THE PRINCESS IRULANDune held me for over 616 of the paperback's 794 pages (appendixes, a map and an afterword by Brian Hebert stretch this edition to 883 pages) and in spite of its headlong dive into anticlimax, distilling the novel's pleasures have reminded me of what a fantastic trip it is. What separates Dune from the work of most of Herbert's peers is the finesse of its prose and the depth of its characters as well as its ideas, which in a novel of this size, are plenty. Rather than write a novel in six sleepless nights as many before and since have done in this genre, Herbert took six years to research and write his science fiction, and the quality control shows.Names like ""Beast"" Rabban or Count Hasimir Fenrig materialized to form clear images of Herbert's characters in my mind, and I liked how each of them--whether noble, assassin or servant--served their institutions and played their part in this galactic intrigue to their end. No one in Dune remains static; there is work to be done or movement to be had at all times. The novel is like a chess game and the faster it plunged toward its climax, these characters did begin to resemble game tokens instead of humans. Herbert also writes entrances much better than he does exits--a symptom of book one in a series, perhaps--but envisions a wealth of roles for women in his universe.Dune is science fiction and if you're in the market for having your imagination stretched, you came to the right place. I found Herbert's ideas to be vastly compelling, many of them explored in detail and at length with fluid prose, as if the author were an anthropologist reporting back on a real universe: A future where expanded consciousness is more powerful than any machine. A matriarchal religious sect steering the genetic future of mankind. A consciousness expanding spice exploited as a commodity. A planet so arid that special suits are required to retain the body's moisture and tears are a phenomenon. There's even song verse! ""This was a song of a friend of mine,"" Paul said. ""I expect he's dead now, Gurney is. He called it his evensong.""The troop grew still, listening as Paul's voice lifted in a sweet boy tenor with the baliset tinkling and strumming beneath it:""This clear time of seeing embers--A gold-bright sun's lost in first dusk.What frenzied senses, desp'rate muskAre consort of rememb'ring.""Jessica felt the verbal music in her breast--pagan and charged with sounds that made her suddenly and intensely aware of herself, feeling her own body and its needs. She listened with a tense stillness.“Night’s pearl-censered requi-em …’Tis for us!What joys run, then—Bright in your eyes—What flower-spangled amoresPull at our hearts …What flower-spangled amoresFill our desires.”And Jessica heard the after-stillness that hummed in the air with the last note. Why does my son sing a love song to that girl-child? she asked herself. She felt an abrupt fear. She could sense life flowing around her and she had no grasp of its reins. Why did he choose that song? she wondered. The instincts are true sometimes. Why did he do this?After several abandoned attempts to adapt Dune to film, particularly in the wake of Star Wars, a big screen version produced by Raffaella De Laurentiis and written and directed by David Lynch opened in December 1984. Notable today for being the first big budget motion picture produced by a woman (with a production price tag of $40 million) and a rare studio assignment from the visionary who'd give the world Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, the film was a commercial disappointment and was nearly universally panned by critics, but has resurfaced as a cult movie. Shot in Mexico, the eclectic cast featured Kyle MacLachlan as Paul, Francesca Annis as Jessica, Jürgen Prochnow as Duke Leto, Freddie Jones as Thufir Hawat, Patrick Stewart as Gurney Halleck, Richard Jordan as Duncan Idaho, Dean Stockwell as Yueh, Kenneth McMillan as Baron Harkonnen, Brad Dourif as Piter De Vries, Sting as Feyd-Rautha, Linda Hunt as Shadout Mapes, Max Von Sydow as Dr. Kynes, Everett McGill as Stilgar, Sean Young as Chani and Virginia Madsen as Princess Irulan. Herbert's ideas are evocatively translated, but Lynch's commitment to imagery over story is an acquired taste."
54,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26681101-markus,Rating 5 out of 5,"Buddy re-read with Athena!“To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.”Thus begins one of the greatest novels ever written.About ten years ago, when I was ten or eleven years old, I took my first cautious steps away from children’s and young adult books and into the wonderful world of adult literature. I remember that there were especially two grand works of fiction that shaped this period of my life, and eventually managed to change it forever. The first was a huge brick of a fantasy novel whose name was The Lord of the Rings. The second was a rather small, blue book with a particularly interesting cover, which I discovered in one of my father’s bookshelves. Its name was Dune.And that was how I first came along on the adventures of Paul-Muad’Dib on the endless sands of Arrakis. I met people like the warmaster Gurney Halleck and the swordmaster Duncan Idaho, the aging assassin Thufir Hawat, the wise and powerful Lady Jessica of the Bene Gesserit, the disgustingly evil Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and the stunningly beautiful Princess Irulan. I encountered the greatest of the sandworms in the deep desert, and I witnessed Muad’Dib as he lived amongst the mysterious blue-eyed Fremen and as he struggled and fought against those who betrayed his family.Now, ten years later, I have read the book once more. And to my great satisfaction I discovered that it had lost none of the magic that worked so well on me the first time. The political machinations of the Great Houses and the Imperium were still as interesting and exciting as the first time. The sandworms were still as awe-inspiring as when I last read about them. And even though the book could not possibly have the same effect on me today as it had on that little boy ten years ago, it was still an amazingly enjoyable book from the first page until the very end. There was more than a fair bit of nostalgia involved when it came to settling on a final rating, and I find it likely that the rating would have been lower if I were reading this for the first time. Still, I would argue that Dune is not only one of my personal favourites, but one of the absolute best examples of fictional literature ever. It has become a pillar on which dozens of later works now stand, from Star Wars to the Wheel of Time. What is it that makes this book so great? My answer would be neither the story nor the characters, even though both of those are great. No, the most extraordinary aspect about this book is most certainly its setting. In contrast to a great majority of science fiction, this novel takes place almost exclusively on one single planet. Arrakis. Dune. Desert planet. This is the world that inspired Tatooine. This is the world on which House Atreides fights for its survival in the heart of a treacherous universe. And, last but not least, this is the world where the sandworms roam. The world of the shai-hulud.
”History is written on the sands of Arrakis.""

History will remember us as wives
2021 update: Reading this at 16, at the age of Paul Atreides, was a brilliant book. Reading this at 23, is all about relating to Jessica. This has aged like fine wine and I cannot wait for the movie.What a book. The science fiction version of Lord of the Rings, but with the politics and intrigue of Game of Thrones. I'll have to reread it again sometime.Edit: It's 2021, the world is in flames. There is no better time to read this book. Fear is the mind killer. There's not much to say that hasn't been said about this book - masterful, artful, anthropological, ecological before its time; a character study, fleshed-out female characters and a story that will be remembered as Muad'Dib was.P.S. Also Denis Villeneuve is going to knock this one out of the park. Arrival and Blade Runner 2049 are two of my favourite films of all time - I see no reason that Dune won't be among them."

58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7451465-jessica,Rating 1 out of 5,"My favourite memory of this book is when I was reading along, thoroughly hating everything, and then the book abruptly ended fifty pages before I was expecting it to because it turns out the rest of it is all appendices.I don't even know where to begin reviewing this book, although the rant I launched into on Tumblr taught me I had many things to say. Perhaps I was doomed to dislike this book when I started at page one and discovered that its two main characters were named Paul and Jessica. Still, I moved past that; I'd heard this book was good, I was going to persevere. Then on page 20 or so Paul was obnoxious and sexist and I got frustrated. And then, it has to be said, Paul never really did anything to redeem himself for being generally obnoxious. Mostly he just oscillated between continuing to be obnoxious and being some all-seeing, all-knowing dispenser of wisdom and neither of those personas was particularly endearing.Honestly, I was annoyed for a lot of the book that Paul had all of these special mental abilities that supposedly had never been had by men before, only women, and Paul was such an arrogant twerp anyway that I strongly disliked him being some kind of Chosen One. I felt that Frank Herbert was going to have this rule that only women can have these powers, the character of Paul should have been a woman then. But then it seems that the entire point of the plot is that he IS the first man to have this abilities - the Kwisatz Haderach or however it's supposed to be spelt - so then I guess it just annoyed me that there was this deep gender essentialism in something that should not have anything to do with gender at all (the innate abilities of the brain...).Aside from that! This book also had approximately 9658976897579668 male characters who I couldn't tell the difference between. Towards the end there some guy named Guernsey or something turned up and supposedly he was Paul's friend from way back but I had no clue who he was and nor was I entirely sure I was supposed to. The female characters who existed seemed mostly interested in basking in the glory of Paul (probably he had a halo or something too, idk). Chani was nothing more than his love interest. That woman he won (as property) by killing Jamis was the same. Alia barely even did anything. Jessica was by far the most developed of the female characters, but even she was really disappointing because literally everyone spent the entire book talking about what a threat she posed to Paul and like, no, she didn't in any way whatsoever. PAUL HIMSELF at one point identified Jessica as his ""true enemy"" and well, I guess he's not all-seeing and all-knowing after all because that was LITERALLY NEVER FOLLOWED UP ON. All she did was disapprove of his relationship with Chani because she's an utter snob and disapproved of him seeing a ""desert girl"". Wow. I'm shaking in my boots, Jessica.There are some defences to be made of this book - for instance, Herbert was obviously not trying to write about anything other than a deeply sexist society, so the fact that women get treated as property and evaluated in terms of their marriageability is not a flaw of the writer so much as the deeply annoying society he invented. Nonetheless, there were not enough female characters and those characters that did exist were not strong enough to counteract this. But then again, the male characters weren't very strong either, hence why I mixed them all up, so... really...Anyway, I was dithering about whether to give this book two stars or three (mostly because I'd heard it was so good and I thought I'd judged it unfairly just because of the names-of-the-characters thing making me hostile from the off). BUT THEN I READ THE LAST PAGE.NO JOKE, the last page is about how Paul has to marry this Princess Irulan to secure peace across the kingdoms or something but NO WORRIES because he's going to treat Princess Irulan like a worthless piece of shit forever because his true love is Chani! And Jessica is really pleased about this because she no longer hates Chani and she apparently thinks Princess Irulan deserves to live a life of misery because, y'know, she dared to be born a woman into a family that would force her into an arranged marriage and that is definitely all her fault.Seriously, I hate you Jessica.And basically everyone in this book, really. I guess Chani was okay, if not very well developed. Also the woman Paul won off Jamis, she was sassy, except I forgot her name so I guess not that sassy.In conclusion...This book is hyped beyond all proportion. I didn't understand it and it annoyed me but if you like long books with irritating and indistinguishable characters, go for your life.(EDIT: I decided to demote this book from two stars to one star, because I actually really hated it so two stars was bizarrely generous. I don't remember anything I liked about this book. Don't read it.)"
59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79765515-prerna,Rating 3 out of 5,"I feel like I'm throwing myself to the sharks here, but my thoughts on this book are so conflicting. Is it about white-saviorism or is it a critique of white-saviorism? Who knows?And this surely has some very badass female characters but can we also talk about how disturbing the idea of that order of nuns - the bene gesserit, is? And the almost complete absence of reproductive rights had me squirming. It's also fascinating how certain gender roles from Herbert's time are preserved even within the story. I'm so tired of the 'history is cyclical, you cannot completely alter the future even with enough foreknowledge' trope in sci-fi, but I guees Herbert was amongst the first to use it and that must be lauded. One of my Goodreads friends, Jan-Maat, told me about historian Daniel Immerwahr's analysis of the Dune series and I'm so into it. Dune is predominantly about ecology and preservation of indigenous culture. It's about the seizure of native lands and the dispossession it causes. In the first book the protagonist Paul Atreides 'goes native' and joins the indigenous fremen in their revolt against the galactic empire after his family is betrayed. He takes a fremen name, learns their culture, takes a fremen 'concubine' and turns into a messiah figure (this is where the debate about white saviorism plays in.) Herbert himself was very sympathetic towards indigenous communities and rallied for their causes, but he was also a libertarian, far-right political writer. Immerwahr tries to show that this unresolved conflict between Herbert's two opposing political commitments shows up in the power dynamics and political differentials within the series. And I must say, I agree.'Spice' has been interpreted as a psychedelic drug and there are clear middle-Eastern influences in the writing of fremen culture (although Herbert had a very surface understanding of middle-Eastern culture and politics, and never went deep into it.) The far-right on the other hand, has been very intolerant of drugs, the middle East, climate change, ecological preservation and indigenous populations. This difference in Herbert's ideologies is so clearly discernible in Paul's shifting roles between hero and villain. The book is also about counter culture and interestingly, we have seen a rise of right wing counter culture recently and a renewed interest in the Dune series. Coincidence? I don't think so."

Basically, it wasn’t for me. How wrong I was!Dune is set on the desert planet Arrakis, where water is precious and the only thing of value is the “spice” melange. Paul Atreides is the heir to a noble family tasked with ruling this inhospitable planet. That is, until, the Atreides family is betrayed...While writing this review and thinking about the journey that was reading Dune, I am overwhelmed with the NEED to continue on with the series. The world-building is fucking incredible, the characters are complex and captivating, and the political feuds are so intricate and gripping. Oh, and the pièce de résistance, those sandworms. Dune is a triumph!Whilst the depiction of women is somewhat problematic in the Dune universe, I found myself most intrigued by the female characters. From Lady Jessica herself, Paul’s powerful and fearsome mother, to Alia, the most fucking badass toddler to ever exist in fiction possibly. I appreciate that although Paul is “The Chosen One”, he is still complex and flawed, and I don’t find myself actually liking him that much? Yet I still want to know more. I weirdly enjoyed the Harkonnen scenes the most, the most vile and villainous of villains that ever did exist.I’m a little in awe of what Herbert was able to achieve - there’s just SO MUCH going on, yet all of the different themes and concepts are given equal weight. It’s literally impossible to break down everything I want to fangirl over and comment on in one single IG caption.In summary, do not be intimidated by Dune. Let the spice flow. 4.5 stars."
61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,Rating 5 out of 5,"Holy Shai-hulud! It was definitely time for me to finally read this truly great classic of science fiction!I must say that I've watched the two mini-series, Dune and Children of Dune, in my teenage years. Thus, I already had a grasp of the story, what it was about.However, nothing could have prepared me for the great writing style, the dense philosophy, ecology, and mythology of this story. It takes the term ""world-building"" to a whole new level.So what is this about?Well, that is not easily answered, but put very simply it is a book about a galactic empire and intrigue among the aristocratic houses within it. At the heart of the tale are the Emperor, the House Atreidis, and the House Harkonnen.An assassination sets into motion a very old prophecy and the uprising of a people that has been suppressed for generations.It's also about a planet that is merely a ""factory"" for melange (spice) and about the delicate balance of nature even in the most desolate of places.Now, considering where I live and current events here, I must admit that reading all the Muslim names and terms, but especially reading about Jihad, made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable. The Fremen, the natives of the planet Arrakis (the afore-mentioned ""factory"" for spice), are fanatically religious and (almost happily) willing to commit genocide. This should have really turned me off. However, the story has enough ""westerness"" on one hand (the way the aristocracy as well as certain story elements are portrayed) and Paul on the other to make up for it (Paul, despite being the prophesied saviour, does everything he can to prevent genocide and actually tries to reign in the people worshipping him). I liked the burden Paul carries and that he realizes it really is a burden (death) and was therefore torn between using his powers and knowing their limits, being chivalrous and ruthless at the same time.One of the greatest joys while reading this book (apart from the art of my edition which I shared with all of you through my status updates) was the ecology of the story. It was made clear in the introduction already, but even without that comment it would have been more than clear that Frank Herbert had the utmost respect for scientists and their work. One of the most impressive characters (Kynes) was a planetologist after all. It helps tremendously to bring this planet to life and make the reader trod from dune to cavern to city to any other place in this story. One feels the heat, the sand, the dryness of the place, and marvels just as much as any person within the story whenever there is a tiny bit of green presented or when a worm attacks.But I also enjoy the Bene Gesserit. Their plans are certainly ... ambiguous at best. Genetic perfection. But also the plan to combine all houses and therefore create a certain equilibrium (and exert control). It's cold logic and I'm strongly opposed to forced matches or ""breeding"" of humans in general, but one cannot help but wonder if events hadn't been more peaceful if everyone had played his/her part as planned.There is also a lot of heartbreak - both on the small and large scale. For example, I cannot stop thinking about the slave trade and how some people are treated by basically everyone here. Or like Irulan. In the book, Irulan has such a little active role, appearing just briefly at the very end of the tale but shining in that moment through her brave selflessnesss. Other than that, we only have quotes from various writings of hers about Muad'Dib and yet I felt so much pity for her. Sure, she lives the life of a princess with all its comforts (as opposed to the slaves or poor people of Arrakis) but although Paul is never cruel, he also doesn't love her (Irulan is just his key to the throne) and a loveless life is cruel enough in and of itself.Then again, there is Chani, having Paul's love but never going to have the chance to call herself his wife (another form of sacrifice, to say nothing of their first-born son they've lost).Every detail in this epic story has its place and though the novel is more about a wide sweep of events instead of deep characterization, every person is unique and delightful in their own way (be it vile Baron Harkonnen - no, I don't have a problem with the main villain being gay - , weird little badass Alia, powerful but also kind of lost Paul, underestimated Fenring and his wife, or any one of the ""background characters"") and there is development (mostly for Paul of course).I cannot rave enough about this book, will watch the David Lynch movie tomorrow (since I haven't seen it yet), re-watch the mini-series for comparison and old times' sake, and (at some point in time) definitely re-read the book."

Only I will remain.” Dune is one of those reads that just feels so, so iconic when you read it. There is a certain gravitas to the writing that makes you feel like you are about experience a truly unique reading journey.My brother very kindly gifted me with a special edition of Dune, so I was very lucky to be accompanied by some absolutely fantastic illustrations as I read this.“There is no escape—we pay for the violence of our ancestors.” Dune is a book that after reading and thinking on it a while I admire so much. It has had such a huge role on science fiction since its release, and is a truly epic tale that encapsulates so much life and vividness in the pages. Whilst I did not adore the read, it is one that I still thoroughly enjoyed, and would most definitely read again in the future.The world is of course one of the strong points. We are taken to a place that has living, thriving politics, with a rich history that makes the story feel very real. I thoroughly enjoyed how Frank Herbert included the reader in the mechanisms that would run a planet such as this, and shows how every decision influences the future of our characters.For me the characters were a mixed bag. Those such as Duncan Idaho were compelling, with fleshed out motivations and some truly epic moments. The villains were similarly fantastic. The Baron was terrifying, and Frank Herbert did a great job making sure he did not full into the archetype, and in doing so crafted such an entertaining character.“The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.” Sadly, I did not click as much with Paul and Jessica, two of the main characters. They were solid, but as leading roles I felt they did lack something for me. It was by no means a negative to the story, but for me it really held it back from reaching those higher levels, despite the success of everything across the other spheres.Dune is most certainly a unique and extraordinary book in many ways, and I can see how this has shaped an entire genre and dictated how it has evolved in so many ways. Not many books can claim to have had such an impact. And I think Dune deserves that. Whilst everything did not click with me, most of it did, and there were so many awesome ideas and concepts that Frank Herbert explored so well. A great mix of characters, with a certainly epic story, and an engaging plot that rides on the revenge story that we love so much.4.25/5 STARS"

What I can say is that as someone who doesn't read a lot of sci-fi/high fantasy, I found this a lot easier to read than I expected! Particularly because I watched the 2021 film (Part One) before reading this so I had a visual reference as well as general understanding of the various factions/politics at play which really helped. As well as the terminology and concepts the book explores. That made the first 55% or so of the book fly by as more of a 'refresher' since the movie pretty faithfully adapts that portion of the story. Of course in the book you get a bit more detail and character depth which I loved.I'm a sucker for themes of politics and religion, fate and humanity (animals vs humans), and more that was explored through this exciting and fast-paced story. The dialogue was great. I loved the epigraphs at the start of each chapter. All in all, I am shocked but happy with how much I loved this!"
64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt,Rating 5 out of 5,"Does the world need another Dune review? I very much doubt it needs mine but that never stopped me before, saturation be damned!Dune in and of itself, in isolation from the rest of the numerous other Dune books, is by general consensus the greatest sci-fi novel of all time. You may not agree, and one book can not please everybody but statistically Dune comes closest to achieving just this. Witness how often you see it at or near the top of all-time best sf books lists.I never read Dune with the intent to reviewing it before, it makes for a more attentive and actually more enjoyable reading experience. When I first read it in my early teens I did not really appreciate it, I thought it was good but overrated. There are just too much depth for my young mind to handle. I got the gist of the story just fine but the richness of the novel completely escaped me.What makes Dune superior to most sf books is the quality of the world building. Frank Herbert went into painstaking details of Arrakis without ever bogging down the story. During the main body of the novel (excluding the appendices) he did not once resort to making info dumps. How many modern day sf authors can do that? Still, world building alone can not possibly account for the legendary status of the book. Herbert places equal emphasis on the characterization, plot and prose. The book is full of memorable characters from the badass Lady Jessica, to Paul Atreides who starts off as a fairly generic Luke Skywalkerish “chosen one” kid to a messianic figure always ready with a sage comment for every occasion. The villains are even more colorful, especially the super-sized Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, so fat he needs anti gravity devices to help support his girth (cue worthless yo papa so fat he needs suspensors jokes). And his psychotic nephew Feyd-Rautha who is a ruthless natural born killer and seems kind of gay for some reason. When I read it as a young lad the book seemed very long, but by today’s gigantic epic sf/f books standard Dune’s 896 pages length does not seems like much of a challenge if you take into account almost 100 pages of appendices and glossary. It is a highly readable and accessible book that transports the reader to a very vividly realized place. If you are looking for a bit of escapism you can not beat reading Dune for the first time.That's enough review I think, I just want to make a few random observations for people who are familiar with this book (more than half the people who read this review imagine):- Most memorable scene for me is the “Gom Jabbar” test where Paul Atreides has his humanity tested by the Reverend Mother. What is yours?- I love the little quotes from all those Muad'Dib books by the Princess Irulan. How many are there? Is there a “Muad'Dib’s Cookery Without Water” or perhaps a Muad'Dib popup book for the kids?- The stillsuits are great, I want one!- What is with all the “ah-h-h” business most (lesser) writers make do with an ""ah!"" or an ""aha!"". Are the characters having orgasms?- Don’t skip the appendices, they are well worth reading.- Last but not least, do check out Dune - Book Summary & Analysis by Thug Notes on Youtube, preferably after you have finished Dune; it's funny, insightful and informative. Come to think of it, if you are having any difficulty getting through Dune you may want to watch this."

“there is no escape — we pay for the violence of our ancestors.”

a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…dune is widely regarded as the progenitor of the (modern) sci-fi genre. mixing the political intrigue of feudalism with philosophy, environmentalism, and a classic hero’s journey, the story centers on the atreides family as they journey to one of the most fought-over planets in the galaxy: arrakis.this desert planet is hostile in every meaning of the word: in its harsh climate and dangerous fauna, its native population of tough-as-nails fremen, and in the presence of atreides’ rival house harkonnen. all are factors that pose a risk to atreides’ control of the planet.thanks to an omniscient narrator, we’re keenly aware of any character’s thoughts and motivations throughout the story. our main protagonists, however, are undoubtedly paul atreides, a 15-year-old boy rumored to be a child of prophecy, and lady jessica, paul’s mother, a powerful leader with superhuman abilities that she’s also taught to her son.a lot of elements of this story will feel like known classics. we witness paul’s growth from boy to man as he accepts the mantle of leadership, and passes several tests of adulthood. not only his family and his father’s trusted lieutenants act as his teachers, but so does the planet itself. we know he’s gotta stumble and fall before he can take his rightful place as his father’s heir.however, i was very pleasantly surprised by the level of sophistication in the themes that herbert weaves into the story: profit versus environmentalism (see also: a metaphor for oil) with a side-serving of ecology and terraforming, the possibly violent combination of mysticism/religion and politics, and the level of manipulation that’s often required to move about in a rigid world like that of dune.it’s a constant give and take, though, which i thought permeated every single aspect of the story. one or two things are really, really cool and then whatever accompanies those things is decidedly not cool.let’s take the characters. where paul and jessica feel like very complete, flawed, and complex characters, a lot of the others are like… it’s not even cardboard. hot air, then? i mean, we have a fat, gay, pedophile antagonist, for god’s sake. and paul’s love interest is just there for only that.same goes for cultural aspects: the way the fremen culture is fully based on the preservation of water, working its way into language and customs and misunderstandings, is amazingly immersive. but then the rest of their ways are just a very obvious, butchered rip-off of a westernized perception of the imazigen, the indigenous people of north africa (with some buddhist-esque sayings thrown in).then there’s the rigidity of the patriarchal aspects of the galaxy’s feudalist society: we see lady jessica defy them and play around them in a myriad of clever, powerful ways that establish her agency and her ability to function beyond any sexist female archetypes. sure, she might’ve birthed a messianic figure, but she’s a smart political advisor and she can whoop any warrior’s ass because she’s a superb fighter, too.and yet all the other women in the story are either (1) background fodder, (2) making babies, (3) thinking about making babies so bloodlines can be manipulated in a very creepy eugenics way, or (4) servant, concubine, wife or pleasure slave.meanwhile, paul is out there literally defying the rigid view (and conflation) of sex and gender to a point where the subtext argues he’s neither man nor woman, but all the other characters remain firmly entrenched in their subscribed roles (which is easy, here: man = battle, woman = birth).and oh, arrakis, you were done dirty too. a hostile desert planet with something as amazing as sandworms! and spice, the product that shapes galaxy-wide profit systems and changes the very fabric of the people consuming it. and yet the book never seems to move beyond Generic Sandy Places and has a complete lack of engaging descriptions. i also can’t believe i got baited by such a cool terraforming plot and then it NEVER happened. shame on you, herbert!see what i mean? it’s inevitable: in this book, you cannot have your cake and eat it, too. do you want to have a cool thing? sure, but you’ll also have to accept a very uncool thing alongside it. so whether you’ll enjoy this book probably depends on how well you can stomach the free bad stuff herbert is handing out alongside his interesting concepts.but when it’s good, it’s Pretty Damn Good. the quotability of this book is off the charts. philosophically, there’s so many interesting discussions going on about identity, responsibility, revenge, defying existing systems. and unlike most reviewers out here, i actually loved the dialogue -- which is great, because that’s about 80% of the book.(the other 20% are cursory descriptions, prophetic visions, and terrible action scenes.)the impact of this book cannot be denied. does it have problems? yes. myriads. the orientalism and white savior stuff probably being some of the worst offenders. did i still have an unexpectedly good time reading it, which might have been tinted by my nostalgia glasses? also yes.i like tortured heroes and women who are so confident in themselves that they’re like, fuck you, i’m powerful enough to create the messiah so i will. i like it when bad guys get stabbed and when scientists have beautiful, romantic dreams about terraforming.at the end of the day, this book is kinda like star wars, but with more substance. or wait, is it the other way around -- and star wars is like dune, but with less substance…? either way, both have more than enough sand.✎ 4.0 stars."

The most notable copycat is Star Wars. As I read ""Dune"", I was amazed by how much of the story was directly lifted by the Star Wars movies.Of course, ""Dune"" is much darker than Star Wars and more epic in scope. The world-building is very well done, and Frank Herbert does a brilliant job addressing the philosophical and practical implications of trusting the fate of a world to a single messiah-type figure. Do the ends justify the means? Herbert leaves this as an open question.Why only four stars? I subtracted one star because of the clunky writing style, which is a barrier for fully enjoying this work. This may be sacrilege, but I think this is a case where collaborative writing would have improved the work. With Frank Herbert as the ideas guy paired with someone who is devoted solely to writing, I think ""Dune"" could have risen to even greater heights."
69,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1262683-terry,Rating 5 out of 5,"Is it space opera? Is it political commentary? Is it philosophical exploration? Is it fantasy? _Dune_ is all of these things and possibly more. One thing I do know: it's a kick-ass read!I've loved this book since I first plunged into it's mightily constructed, weird and obscure world. Of course it's hailed as a classic, and I am one of those that agrees. The sheer magnitude of Herbert's invention, his monumental world-building tied with an exciting story of betrayal, survival, rebellion and ultimate ascendance are more than enough to guarantee that. His characters too, are worthy of note: Paul Atreides the young heir to not only a ducal throne, but the hopes and desires of the oppressed population of an entire planet and the strange otherworldly powers of prescience and command that are his unique birthright; his mother Jessica torn between devotion to her family and her pledge to a generations-long plan spawned by a secret order bent on controlling the universe from behing the scenes; Chani and Stilgar the wild yet honourable representatives of a dangerous people just waiting to burst their chains and explode onto an unsuspecting universe. Add to these heroes the malign Baron Harkonnen and his debased nephews Feyd Rautha and ""the beast"" Rabban, the spiteful and covetous Emperor Shaddam IV, masterminds of the fall of Paul's House, and we have the recipe for an exciting contest of wills with no less than the future of humanity at stake.Even without an exciting story to drive it, the book is almost worth reading just to experience the world created by Herbert. 10,000 years in the future mankind has experience the ""Butlerian Jihad"" wherein all ""thinking machines"" were destroyed and the hatred of the technological has a religious conviction. In their place there are the Mentats, the ""human computers"" able to utilize the human mind to nearly it's full potential, drawing accurate inferences and conclusions with minimal data. There is the Sisterhood of the Bene Gesserit, a community of women who have honed their mental powers to the point of a near magical ability to coerce, tied with a training in politics and influence that would make Machiavelli proud. Finally is the Guild: a community of mutated humans, the sole ""pilots"" able to bend space and foresee their path amidst the void and thus keep interstellar trade and community together. Both the Siterhood and the Guild owe their great powers to the mysterious spice Melange, the only product of the planet Arrakis (known colloquially as Dune) and the society of the Empire in general also depends on it for its ""geriatric qualities"". Dune is thus the linch-pin for all Imperial power. Without the spice, travel ceases, trade stops, life ends. He who controls the spice controls the universe.Upon this stage is born Paul Atreides, the son of the Duke who is to take control of Arrakis as a fiefdom for the emperor. Paul is not merely the heir to political power though, for he is the last link in a chain of breeding that has been going on for generations, part of a plan created by the Bene Gesserit in the hopes of breeding a superhuman whom they could control. But Paul was born too early, his mother's rebellion against her orders have brought about an unforeseen occurrence. Now in the midst of political betrayal and the loss of all he has known Paul must also fight for survival amongst the most merciless tribe of humanity the universe has formed. Greater powers than any human before him has known will be thrust upon the young man, and the mantle of messiah will be his to accept or reject.Did I mention that I love this book? Well I do. I highly recommend it to any and all. I must admit that there is the occasional infelicity in some of Herbert's prose (and a too-heavy reliance on inner monologues to either state the obvious or convey information to the reader), but overall I can forgive him this for having crafted such an excellent tale. Woven into the story of a tottering space empire are real questions about ecology, responsibility and human life that are well-worth thinking about. Politics is not just a veneer, but the lifeblood of this story and, to me at least, it makes it all the more exciting.I'll admit right here that I am one of the few who actually likes all of the original Dune books, though I must admit that after the original trilogy Herbert seems to lose some of the strands of his narrative thread and my admiration is mostly due to the character of  Duncan Idaho  and the world-building. (But please avoid the prequels and sequels written by Herbert's son and Kevin Anderson in an attempt to cash in on the franchise, they are worse than anathema.)Also posted at Shelf Inflicted"

Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear” An epic Science Fiction canon, a true classic and one that everyone should read once. Fascinating, complex, imaginative and ground-breaking in many ways. So, did I love it? The answer is yes and no but first a short summary of the plot.The PlotDune is set on the desert planet Arrakis, one of the many planets in the empire, and run by a few aristocratic families mainly the House of Atreides and House Harkonnen who both seek to control its more precious resource. A powerful spice that is necessary for space travel, mindfulness, and is known to extend the life of those who use it. “For he who controls the spice controls the universe"".Survival, treachery, greed, and betrayal are at every turn as Paul Atreides must, having succeeded his father as head of the family, now win the most significant battle of all. Control of the melange – the spice. As he faces many in battle, he must also devise a method of mining the spice for use. However, despite the technology available he turns to the natural world of the planet Dune for his answer and must learn to control the worms. His new army of workers. Review and Comments Although set in space it is a book that contains a lot of the key ingredients for an epic novel, Power, Politics, War, Religion, and love with copious amounts of greed, deception, betrayal with a fascinating array of characters. This part I loved, and the writing style is excellent even though it was too long in places. The but is, I don’t particularly enjoy science fiction, and sometimes it was a bit too far fetched particularly the inclusion of worms to helped mine the spice. And whilst a lot of ideas have been taken and bettered in later sci-fi books and films, it is important to remember this book was written in the 1960’s and ground-breaking at the time. Yet despite being written a long time ago I was in awe of the wonderful imagination it took to write such a timeless classic.I have rated ‘Dune’ in the context of the genre it was written for, the writing style, characters, plot, and overall enjoyment. A 3/4 and settled on a ‘4’.And Dune completes my reading challenge!!!"

The author seemed to be trying really hard to make everything really mysterious and mythical, and all I could think was how lame it was: all-blue eyes, a worms called a ""makers,"" suits where you drink your own body moisture (disgusting). I'm also annoyed that this book was read in exchange for Pride and Prejudice. Compared with a timeless classic the book seems like a 1st grade primer. Austen is a master of plot and suspense. You may not like the subject matter, admittedly it is a little girlie, but the woman can write. Herbert? Not even close."
72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64621419-dennis,Rating 3 out of 5,"One of the world's most loved science-fiction novels of all time. There's probably not a lot that hasn't been said about this book. So, let's get straight to the elephant in the room. Why only three stars?Honestly, it's a little hard for me to explain. Three stars means ""I liked it"". And I did, in fact, often find it intriguing. But except for the intricate world-building I can't really point to a tangible reason for that.On the other hand there are several things I wasn't impressed with. From Princess Irulan spoiling several plot-developments at the beginning of chapters, the languishing pace and a lack of characters I cared about to average (dialogue) or below average (inner monologue) writing. Especially the last point was a little annoying. You really don't have to explain to me everything that has just happened by letting the characters think about it at length. Over and over and over. Actually, now that I think about it, that's pretty bad writing.Surprisingly little sci-fi in this sci-fi classic as well. But that was more of a surprise than a disappointment.If I had read this in another month, not one where I struggled badly reading anything, I might have appreciated a book that's so heavy on politics and religion maybe a little bit more. Maybe.Sandworms are cool though. And the one passage that I added to my quotes is actually pretty awesome."

But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.”My mind is a whirling mess as Lady Jessica's assurance to Chani echoes in my head. What an absolute glorious read in this vivid universe created by Frank Herbert my god that was something. I am typing out a full review now and will hopefully post it soonone of the primary points is how 3rd person omniscient pov was so essential to tell this tale. Knowing the character's history and motivations and future in a world where characters were also able to access that information was paramount to the text and created such a unique reading experience (since most modern books aren't written in omniscient). The tension was shifted because the questions raised were so much more macro.
75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,Rating 5 out of 5,"“Dune” is probably my husband’s favorite book, and he was so happy that I decided to re-read it so that we could talk about it. We had just watched the absolutely stunning Denis Villeneuve movie (thoughts about that at the end of the review) and we were both geeking out pretty hard about it. It was a pleasure to re-immerse myself in Herbert’s world, and while my previous criticism of the book still holds, I found myself enjoying it so much more this time. Perhaps it is because books like “Dune”, which are so complex and layered, really benefit for re-reading, as you notice things you might have glossed over before, and reconnect with interesting ideas and concepts you had enjoyed the first time around… I’m very excited to add “Dune Messiah” and “Children of Dune” to my short term reading list, as I can’t wait to go back to Arrakis!--Original review:My mother is a bonafide, vintage geek girl. I grew up watching “Star Trek” with her and she used to read me Tolkein as bed-time stories. She had piles of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke books all over the place. These days, she obsesses over “Game of Thrones”… As you can guess, she also loves “Dune”, and she was so excited when the 2000 series finally aired on the Space channel. That was my first exposure to Frank Herbert’s work and it took me a very long time to get around to reading the actual book.At this point, I think everyone know this is a messianic story, with a pretty classic layout. A prophecy foretold the arrival of a warrior-leader on the desert planet of Arrakis, who would free it’s people and turn the planet into a paradise where no one would ever want for water again. In parallel, the Emperor gives control of the planet to House Atreide: it’s the most valuable planet in the universe, as it is the only source of the precious spice, necessary to space travel: but it is also a white elephant, as it is hostile and House Harkonnen, the devious former rulers, will stop at nothing to get it back. You can already see how that will unfold. The strength of this book is not in the element of surprise, it is in the mind-blowing world-building and characterization. The details of the social structure, history, customs, religion and politics in “Dune” make it feel incredibly real as your turn the pages. Having seen the series before reading the book, I pictured everyone dressed in elaborate, geometrical costumes and headdresses; I saw monumental architecture with bright colours.But what I loved the most about “Dune” is that it is the deconstruction of a messiah. How does it feel to be the person legend has predicted for generations, anxiously anticipated by the oppressed, who will blindly follow you anywhere because they fanatically believe that you will save them? Knowing many will die to fulfil the prophecies and that this blood will ultimately be on your hand, seeing small events and knowing they will one day be told as grandiose moments that had very little to do with what actually happened. That can’t be a comfortable hat to wear and I felt for Paul. I also felt for Jessica, who watched her son transform into something she could have hardly imagined when she decided to disobey the orders of the Bene Gesserit and provide her lover with a son and heir instead of a daughter.This brings me to how fascinated I was with the amount of control the Bene Gesserit held over the various legends and folk tales, with their Missionaria Protectiva and their breeding program. I wanted to know all about it, read their histories and plans! I think it a very successful world-building when I wish I could live in it and go to the local library to read about it!That being said, the dryness of the writing was a bit of a turn-off. I was so annoyed every time Hebert felt the need to write “Aahh” or “Hum” mid-dialogue, to show me the person speaking was hesitating. I feel like he could have been more evocative without resorting to this weird addition to conversation. I could have also used more lush descriptions, to cement his world in my brain and make it even more alive. But these are really minor qualms: I really enjoyed this book, and I will be reading the sequels.--Thoughts about the 2021 movie:I am a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve, and I was so excited when the news that he’d be directing a new adaptation of “Dune” came out – and he did not disappoint. The other versions are cool in their own rights, but they have a certain tackiness to their looks that made it hard for me to really buy into the illusion of the movies. This time, the absolute beauty of the photography, the masterful music and the gorgeous costumes and sets blew me away, and I must have muttered “This is so fucking cool!” a dozen time. The casting is perfect, and I say that as someone who detests Chalamet – I still kinda want to punch him, but the skinny bastard is so good… I’m so glad that the second movie is going to happen, because I want this to become the gold standard for sci-fi films."

No fue nunca del tipo de ciencia ficción que me ha gustado. Esta vez se me haya hecho algo más lenta y obsoleta su narrativa( mi opinión).Es verdad que toda la info. intrínseca en sus historias y diálogos hacen de esta obra una muy completa. Una novela y seguramente saga ( al que se la lea completa) que perdurará, y de las que se continuarán sirviendo muchos escritores de ciencia ficción como parte de luz inspiracional para crear sus propios mundos. Como lo ha sido tb de alguna manera en mi caso. No obstante, para mi gusto actual demasiado muy épica y obsoleta para con el sentido de la ciencia ficción y su tecnología de nuestros tiempos.La ciencia ficción no son solo naves voladoras, mundos conquistados o gusanos gigantes, tambien lo son sus diálogos y los conocimientos tecnológicos actuales que en ellos se describan. Ojo, una muy buena obra!!! Es solo que no me entretuvo tanto en su reelectura años después.Pero es solo mi opinión!"

The one-eyed vision of the future, probing ahead to Star Wars and The Godfather and… Beetlejuice? Yes, Beetlejuice.

81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was the third or fourth time I've read this story and it was just as enjoyable as the very first time - if not even more so thanks to me now knowing the full mythology (almost) which gives further insight into the beginnings (hindsight is a nice thing).We are in the far future, in a far-spread feudal galactic empire full of noble houses that control different planets. There is a navigators' guild who ensures space travel as well as the sisterhood of the Bene Gesserit, an order of female seers that also control bloodlines through clever and strategic influence. The most important planet in this setting is Arrakis, also called Dune, where the mysterious drug ""Melange"" (aka ""Spice"") is made. This drug is necessary for the navigators to see where they are taking the ships to and for the sisterhood to foretell the future somewhat. Therefore, fiefdom of Arrakis is prestigious but also dangerous thanks to court intrigues. So far, House Harkonnen has controlled Arrakis but the emperor has now charged House Atreidis with the task.Thus, young Paul Atreidis goes from his Earth-like place of birth to the desert planet with his father (Lord Leto Atreidis), his mother (Lady Jessica, NOT a noble but ""merely"" Lord Leto's concubine and a Bene Gesserit) as well as the entire household (war masters, teachers, and cooks alike). It's quite the culture shock for him there as even tears are alien to the native population because literally every drop of water is precious.What is more, he might be the prophesized messiah - which at first comes in handy when almost the entire Atreidis family is slaughtered, but also brings immeasurably negative consequences in the end.In between, we get a rich mythology full of giant worms, nomad-like people, intense battles and a whole lot more.Even now, after I (and many others) know this story so well, I shall not reveal more as the discovery is what you should be here for. Immerse yourself in the hot sands and spice trances.The reason I'm reading this again now (and only after I've finally read books 2-6 recently) is that I'll watch part I as filmed by Denis Villeneuve tomorrow. Moreover, I couldn't resist and got myself this stunning edition:Yep, another edition on my shelf and I don't mind at all because Frank Herbert created the scifi equivalent of what Tolkien did with Middle-Earth. It's vast, it's fascinating, it's invigorating. And the writing sweeps you along, too. Great ecological, political and sociological topics are cleverly woven into a gripping space saga."

It has striking multi-pov and I have to admit it was hard to get used to that, and half the readers who will hate it, they will do so because of it extremely weird multipov where often several characters' first-person thoughts were laid out in italics. Yeah, the author did that. Yet, I have to say, it had one of the best world building that I have ever seen in a sci-fi. I have seen world building in Harry Potter, in Hobbit, in Song of Ice and Fire, in Name of the Wind, Mistborn and many other high fantasies. But never have I ever saw such rich world building with so many weird names in a science fiction world. This is truly epic. I love sci fi. If you ever find an epic sci fi that has as detailed and well planned world as this, never hesitate to recommend me. "

Now … I must play the part of Auliya, the Friend of God… Sayyadina to rogue peoples…”🥴⁉️A self-spoiling, mind-numbing sci-fi novel set 20,000 years in the future that takes heavily from Arab culture and the Islamic faith, Dune is little more than a contrived, appropriation nightmare that has received pronounced popularity of late due to the upcoming remake of the film. Set in the year 10,191, teen Paul Atreides, his father Duke Leto and his witch-mother Jessica, travel from their prosperous oceanic home planet, Caladan, to the inhospitable desert planet Arrakis (Dune), after stewardship of Dune is transferred by the galactic Emperor from enemy Harkonnens, who have ruled Arrakis for 80 years, to the Atreides. Dune is home to the much sought-after drug, melange (“spice”), which confers psychic abilities upon the user and enables interstellar space travel. Spice, however, is heavily protected by Arrakis’ deadly giant sandworms, thus is difficult to procure. The Harkonnens who control the planet and its spice are not quick to give up their rule. The Atreides therefore make a pact with the indigenous Zensunni desert dwellers of Arrakis—the mysterious ‘Fremen’ 🥷🏻—to overthrow the enemy Harkonnens and reclaim their right to Arrakis and its spice. This is no easy feat, however, and young Paul is suddenly thrust into the role of messianic saviour... 🪐From the derogatory, lazy mythologising of Arab culture and Islam (‘world-building’ apparently) and the utter bastardisation of Arabic, there was very little I enjoyed about this book. Apparently sci-fi involves justifying the brazen appropriation and bastardisation of the language/culture of ‘exotic’/’eastern’ people (who are ‘alien’ and uncivilised) by flinging the narrative into the future and expecting the reader to be okay with it. In what world (no pun intended) is this accepted as world-building? You think Dune paved the way? Yeah, by showing its successors how NOT to write sci-fi. This was not only grossly unoriginal and embarrassing to read (don’t care that it was written in the 60s. Doesn’t excuse shameless appropriation) but also deeply insulting and disrespectful. Only the wholly ignorant, for whom anything other than their immediate vicinity is deemed irrelevant, would find Herbert’s futuristic world captivating. For the rest of us, it was simply distasteful and embarrassing. He really spun a wheel to choose a random Arabic word and then spun another wheel to assign to it a random English meaning.Yer a Taqwa, Harry… 🪄There are SO many examples to give from this book but here are a few to make you laugh:-	Shari-a (part of a prophecy book regarding superstitious ritual) -	Auliya (God’s handmaiden, audhubillah lol), -	Lisan al-gaib (off-world prophet)-	Mahdi (self-explanatory!)-	Muad’dib (kangaroo mouse, also Paul lol!) -	Fedaykin (adapted from fedayeen)-	Hal yawm (‘now’/’at last’)-	Jihad (religious crusade)-	Jubba cloak (‘naan bread’ energy….)-	Sayyadina (female acolyte in the Fremen hierarchy)-	Zensunni – Basically a blend of Zen Buddhism and Sunni Islam. They’re the followers of the sect that broke away from the teachings of MAOMETH… or the ‘Third Muhammed’ (?!). “It was Ramadhan and April on Bela Tegeuse […] there was a basket with mish mish and baklawa and mugs of liban…” At least he knew what baklawa was ig.“Paul recalled the words of 467 kalima in yueh’s O.C bible."" He.. recalled.. the what now?“Ya! Ya! Yawm! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, wallah! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, wallah!” LMFAOOOIt was also really annoying flitting between the main text and the glossary to remind yourself of what the heck he was on about. One may argue that Herbert’s unrepentant hijacking of Arab culture, the Islamic faith, and other ‘eastern’ cultures does not necessarily portray Arabs/Muslims/PoC in a negative light – one, because it is set tens of thousands of years in the future and all these religions/cultures have essentially ‘merged’ so the misuse and appropriation of words matter little, and two, it cannot possibly be construed as insulting when it has anti-white saviour/anti-imperialist tones. Herbert’s alleged ‘critique’ of the white saviour trope, however, is certainly not evident in Dune and you are fooling yourself if you believe otherwise. Some readers—particularly Muslims/PoC—have not taken a liking to this novel for this very reason. As Herbert fanboys will go on to clarify, the series actually goes against the ‘saviour/messiah’ trope, for Paul is actually an anti-hero! Well, great, but if your introductory book insufferable and off-putting, do you expect readers to stick around to witness your epic revealing in book two or three? Or four or five?Problematic Paul aside, the novel still panders to distasteful Orientalist tropes. The overt ‘Othering’ of the native Freman people (whose DESERT planet Arrakis contains the all-important SUBSTANCE melange that everyone in the galaxy wants to get their hands on… umm middle east oil vibes) paired with the ridiculous (mis)use of Arabic words and phrases made Dune an excruciating read. the only reason I didn’t DNF it is because I wanted to see if it would redeem itself. (Hint: it didn’t. If anything, it got worse).The book is split into three parts, with each chapter demarcated by an unknown ‘Princess Irulan’ who narrates random excerpts from various works of someone called the ‘Muad’Dib’. We found out who she is right at the end. Her interruptions weren’t necessarily irrelevant to the story as a whole, BUT they did counterproductively serve as spoilers and take away the excitement of plot twists. It took away from the story a fair bit and it would’ve been better without. The reader is essentially told everything to come while reading a scene that’s completely unrelated.Also the scenes with the children i.e Baby Leto and Alia were added so haphazardly? As if they’re not major characters/events? He rly flung us two years into the future without any warning LOL. I’ve witnessed a lot of fans defending this book, arguing that the unnecessary complexity, lack of terminology elaboration, contrived dialogue, mediocre characters and deplorable writing was due to the fact that poor Mr. Herbert wrote this in the 60s and that things were different back then. Stop making excuses. Are we really pardoning his lack of creative writing skill on the fact that sci-fi wasn’t big in the 60s? lol. Ultimately, I am giving this novel two stars; one is because I appreciate Herbert’s *attempt* at writing a sci-fi novel and paving the way, so to speak (it brought about Star Wars/Trek, both of which I enjoy) and the other star is for the major roles female characters played in this book – it was refreshing and positively surprising. I also liked the concept of the Bene Gesserit and found their reasoning for the breeding of the Kwisatz Haderach fascinating. If you still want to read this, I’d recommend the audiobook which is more dramatised and entertaining.How typical is it that the movie has not a SINGLE Arab or Muslim in the cast lol. But it’s fine, they have Zendaya! Arab? Asian? who cares, as long as there’s one brown person! 🤩 I’m intrigued to see how the movie compares to the book and how heavily it’ll be altered. I already know they’re using “crusade” instead of “jihad” so I wonder if they’ll change the rest. “He wanted you to know he always trusted you completely, always loved you and cherished you. He said he would sooner have mistrusted himself and he had but one regret – that he never made you his Duchess.” 🥲💔2/5 -----original review (for the lols):best comedy book i’ve read in a while! RTC. but in a nutshell pros:- decent attempt at world building - ya ya yawm!! wallah!! (this made me laugh irl)- badass women bene gesserit 🤩- SOME interesting elements re religion/cultures but largely a rip off of islam 😃👊🏼cons:- THE cultural and religious appropriation??????? yer a taqwa, harry! 🪄🧙🏻‍♀️- the plot itself was mediocre and boring - the characters were annoying. the female ones were quite well written tho which is surprising !- the writing: a lot of waffle - expected bc it is sci fi however he explains none of the words/terminology. at all. so u have to flit between glossary and the main text every other page. impractical and annoying 💯 - absolute mockeryyyyyy of arab culture lmfaooooo (pro: will make u laugh!)- mediocre plot twists 😴🥱- excessively long. there was literally no reason for this book to be so long. cut the waffle and it could be a sweet 200-300 pages MAX. anyway will write a proper review in due time. cba for now! goodnight xx"
88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1-otis-chandler,Rating 5 out of 5,"When people ask me what my favorite book is, Dune is always my answer. Words cannot even do justice to what an epic tale this is. We learn about spirituality, human nature, politics, religion, and the making of a hero.I loved the spiritual aspects of the book the best. The philosophies and practices and Pranu Bindu training of the Bene Gesserit that Paul learns and builds upon. The Bene Gesserit believe in a training regiment that results in a superior human being - one with every sense as refined as possible. This means a focus on learning, on controlling emotion, on controlling your body. My absolute favorite quote from Dune is the Bene Gesserit litany against fear:""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.""The litany is meant to be recited when you are in a moment of fear, and as I first read Dune 20 years ago, I've employed it many times. After Paul employs it when he is fighting Jamis, the affect on him is described as ""a cool bath washing over him. He felt muscles untie themselves, become poised and ready."" I have read a lot about people who perform at high levels - whether it be in athletics or business, and success is all about getting into that zen state where you have a clear, focused mind. Fear is the biggest thing that can cloud one's mind - usually fear of failure, but there are other forms too. While this Litany won't always eliminate it, I've felt it to be useful to recognize the fear and call it out for what it is.There is also a focus in the book on being able to read people by paying attention to the minutia. In many crucial scenes we see Paul and Jessica and others employing this skill, using not only their eyes, but reading the tone of what a person says, what their body language or actions say, and more. Imagine the poker player I could be if I learned these skills!""If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken.""It's interesting to me that so many science fiction novels contemplate a future with AI (aka post-singularity). In Dune, the Butlerian Jihad was the human rebellion to rid itself of AI or ""thinking machines"". They are now banned, and in their place we have Mentats, who are humans with processing powers far greater than any thinking machine. It's unclear to the software engineer in me how exactly that could be without some sort of physical manipulation (insertion of massive amounts of transistors, for instance), but the affect is pretty cool, we get Spock-esque beings who analyze everything extremely logically, and are great at political planning ""feints within feints within feints"". There was a lot in the book about leadership. It started with Paul first learning about it from his Father, and also from the Bene Gesserit. This quote stood out to me:""She asked me to tell her what it is to rule,"" Paul said. “And I said that one commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do."" She hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to continue. ""She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men.""Later as he grows into a leader himself, Paul learns that the most essential ingredient to be a leader is to lead people to a worthy goal.""It was another of the essential ingredients that she felt her son needed: people with a goal. Such people would be easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism. They could be wielded like a sword to win back Paul’s place for him.""Much has been made in modern reviews of Dune of the fact that it's clearly a statement about oil and the Middle East. The book even admits the Fremen are of Sunni descent, and many words they use (Jinn, Jihad, etc) are Arabic. I'm not sure I understand all the undertones, but one thing that was clear was about control of the worlds most precious commodity: ""The people who can destroy a thing, they control it."" I hope we are closing in on the end of the days when oil controls so much, but we aren't there yet. In the meantime, we had best beware of any future Harkonnen's."

It's a lifelong favorite of mine, one of the reasons I'm a science fiction fan. Here's my personal Dune odyssey: My dad was also a fan of SF and, as a young teen and a hardcore bookworm, I used to regularly raid his book collection. (I also found the stack of naughtier SF books that he kept in his closet, but that's another story.) I was probably 13 the first time I tried to read Dune. I was enthralled by the scene where young Paul Atreides has to stick his hand in the Box of Pain, with the poisonous gom jabbar needle being held at his neck by an old Bene Gesserit crone, ready to kill him if he pulls out his hand. And then I quickly came to a stumbling halt with the book. I tried again when I was about 14: same result. I was just too young for it.With some trepidation I pulled Dune off the shelf again when I was 15 or 16 (I don't know why I was so stubborn with this book! maybe it was all the glowing blurbs on the cover). And THIS time I got over the hump and was swept away into the incredibly intense world of Arrakis, the desert world that is the sole source of the Spice, the vividly imagined giant desert worms, strange cultures and peoples, betrayal and corruption, love, destiny, and a duke's son who is trying to find his place and, oh, by the way, stay alive. Whew!My highest recommendation! Seriously, go read this if you haven't. (But feel free to skip the sequels; they were afterthoughts.)"
90,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52710209-lex-kent,Rating 2 out of 5,"2.50 Stars. I tried, I really did but I just can’t. This was a reread for me. I read this in early high school after discovering Ender's Game in 7th grade and someone telling me if I loved that book I would love Dune. Ah no! I would take a million Andrew Wiggins before I had to read about another Paul Atreides. Anyway, in high school I found the book to be wicked dry and I could not stand Paul. After rereading this, while I do have more appreciation for the world building, it is still really slow in parts and I still don’t want anything to do with Paul/Jesus.I wanted to reread this since I was going to watch the movie and was hoping it was just a case of 14-year-old me not liking something that adult me would. Instead, I forgot how boring the book could be in places and I had forgotten how annoying it was to have spoilers given to us at the start of each chapter (from the princess). While I did make it to the end of the book, I must admit I skimmed on multiple occasions when I started to feel sleepy.There were some parts that really do not hold up well, but I didn’t take that into account in my rating. I can’t be surprised that a book has homophobia and sexism when it was written in the 60’s. If this book were written today, then I’d have plenty to pick apart. I did end up seeing the new movie (I’ve watched the old movie too but remember it being so weird that I had no idea what was happening) and I actually liked the new movie better than the book. As a big time reader I feel weird saying that, but I think it solved some of the issues I had with the book. However, Paul was still Paul and the movie can’t fix that so overall I didn’t like the movie half as much as everyone else seems to. I guess I just have to lose some geek points because Dune is not for me."
91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3102740-dirk-grobbelaar,Rating 5 out of 5,"Inevitably, everybody seems to be revisiting Dune in some way or the other. I don’t have too much to add to all the discussion, other than to remind anybody who is interested that the book was initially published in the 1960s (and by a publishing company printing automotive manuals, no less, since nobody else seemed interested). The rest is history, of course.Dune has since gone on to become one of the highest selling Science Fiction novels of all time, and has received numerous critical accolades over the decades. Chances are that just about all of your favourite Space Operas (in whichever form or format) would never have existed if it had not been for this book.Dune has aged extremely well, possibly because of the way it skirts the subject of A.I. (or computer technology). It’s worth noting that this was not an omission on the author’s behalf. Without going into spoilers, “thinking machines” are prohibited in the Dune universe (there is a reason for this, but I won’t waste your time with details). Or, it could just be because Herbert was such a fine writer.As a side note, there are those that push the boundaries of the above prohibition, so there are some technologies that make appearances as the series progresses.The 2021 film obviously shows a lot (it is gorgeous to look at for the most part) but it tells very little. This can be either good or bad, depending on your bent as a movie-goer, but if you are a reader, you owe it to yourself to read this book (even if it is just to give you the right to critique). There is so much more going on beneath the surface.Herbert explores a number of themes, and the book is as poignant as it is exciting. It’s remarkable that all the events taking place here is accounted for in one book.Recommended.All the stars.Favourites.I never wrote much of a review for Dune – since I had read it before the Goodreads era – but… Original “review” below:This is such a magical book for me. I’m not even going to attempt to write an objective review. I simply don’t have the words.Yes, this rating is based on emotion and on how this book affected me and my reading evolution over the years.

93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58642176-semjon,Rating 5 out of 5,"Als Teenager hatte ich mir Anfang der 80er die komplette Serie gekauft. Sci-Fi-Epen gab es damals nicht so viele. Mit Perry Rhodan hatte ich sehr früh begonnen. Lem und Asimov konnten mich als Junge nicht so reizen. Ansonsten bot die Fantasy für mich mehr Abwechslung als das Sci-Fi-Genre. Da war die Vorstellung von einer Wüstenwelt mit Völkern, die sich bekämpfen und Intrigen innerhalb der Häuser echt ein Reiz. Und dann noch der gigantische Sandwurm auf dem alten Heyne-Cover. Ich wollte es unbedingt lesen, aber es überforderte mich als jungen Leser. Ich setzte zweimal an. Erst beim dritten Mal konnte ich Band 1 komplett lesen. Ich fand ihn faszinierend, aber er hatte seine Längen. Begeistert hatte mich der Detailreichtum, mit der Frank Herbert seine Welt aufbaut und erklärt. Interessanterweise wurde der Roman in der Erinnerung immer besser. Frank Herbert hat da etwas ganz Großes erschaffen. Er war für mich Wegbereiter für viele andere Weltraumabenteuer, wie z.B. Star Wars. Daher wird der Roman immer Kultstatus behalten. Da hat auch David Lynchs sehr freie und verkürzte Verfilmung nichts daran geändert. Nachtrag: Die Neuverfilmung von Denis Villeneuve aus dem Jahr 2021 ist absolut großartig, da sie sehr nahe am Buch bleibt, ohne den Zuschauer mit zu viel Hintergrundinformation zu belasten. Villeneuve nimmt sich aber auch die Freiheit, Band 1 in zwei Filmen mit über 5 Stunden Laufzeit zu erzählen. Das ganze Dune-Universum ist einfach fantastisch konzipiert. Ich muss meine Bewertung nun doch auf 5 Sterne erhöhen. "
94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/159685169-maddie-fisher,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved doing an in-depth reread of this masterpiece.This classic is a rich blend of science fiction and fantasy. The world-building is a hurdle for some readers, but it's one of the most impressive and grounding aspects of the story for me. I love the political structure—a tense balance between the emperor, nobility, and space travel guild; all while the religious order pulls strings to keep influence in the most powerful families. Then there is the planet itself with its creatures and natives, the scarce but essential spice resource at the heart of all the conflict, and all the weapons, suits, vehicles, and shelters that are fully imagined and realized. It feels real, it's so well-developed. This plot also hits for me every time. The natives harbor precious secrets and skills. There is so much intrigue in this story chapter upon chapter, and so many competent and deadly characters playing their parts. It's like watching an imperial chess match on the grandest of scales. And it never gets old for me.The heart of this story is the characters, and the exploration of culture, tradition, and customs as an incredibly formidable power humans may possess. The Atreides house is so impressive from a purely tactical and practical standpoint, but beyond that, the Atreides inspire loyalty. Their men never break under pressure. They can never be swayed to corruption. They are such wise, compassionate, and cunning leaders. And I fall harder for them every time I read this story. The Fremen also display such incredible unity and collective behavior. I come away from this story inspired by the outmaneuvering of corruption, the brilliance of not being stagnant, the power of observation, and the strength in mastering the self. I feel moved by the devotion the characters have to one another; that love grounds them when they are most corruptable by heavy burdens of power and responsibility...terrible purpose. This is a story about love for home and family and the lengths one will go to protect and honor and avenge them. Beyond that, it's a story about being the better person, in absolutely every possible way.It's one of the greats. It is one of the leaders in the genre to this day, and for good reason."
95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1986675-brett-c,Rating 1 out of 5,"I tried, I didn't like it. It was hard for me to get into the plot. Quite frankly most of this book was boring. I can see how this is considered a classic work and is entitled to the credit it deserves. This story had some decent points and descriptive language that added character to the story. The overall story plot included hidden messages of political intrigue and the rise and fall of empires, environmentalism, and even religious undertones that all added to create this 'space opera' epic. Having said all that, it still didn't grab my attention. The only one thing I thought was neat was the transliterated Arabic language inferences throughout the story. Some examples were (mahdi, kull wahad, hajj, jihad, kitab, lisan al-ghaib). I'm sure there were other languages used in adding dimension to this world but I was unable to identify them off hand. I only read this book because it has been suggested to me for years now. Now that I've finally gotten around to it, at least now I know it wasn't for me. Thanks!"

97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20498957-claudia,Rating 5 out of 5,"So, I've reread the book and watched the movie.First, the movie: visually, it's impecable, and the actors well chosen. The story follows the storyline quite accurately, however the worldbuilding and characters' background are missing entirely. One who did not read the book will understand nothing from it, fact already confirmed. Its message is nonexistent. The fact that it's just part one doesn't help either. The secondary characters are mainly puppets; the focus is on Paul, and Paul alone. And no other can make this movie to match the book, because it's an impossible task: the story and characters alike have too many layers to be transposed on screen. What Villeneuve did was the best possible outcome. But from the entartainment factor's PoV it's great; well worth it watching in 3D.Now the book: I wanted to reread it for years, but I was afraid that after so many other great sci-fi stories, I wouldn't like it just as much. I was wrong. The best thing about rereading a book is that you are able to focus on details, rather than the plot or main thread, and to better understand it. And that was exactly the case here. I love the worldbuilding, the multiple layers, how Paul is actually an antihero from a PoV. One more thing: only now I have realized how much inspiration George Lucas drew from this book for the first Star Wars movies. I don't know how I didn't see it before, although I have read about this. I guess the info didn't sink in until now.Some sci-fi books are not aging well at all, but Dune will always be contemporary with the reader. It is now more actual than ever.-----Have to recall the lost details before seeing the movie, on which I have my doubts, but we'll see."

Not just of the science fiction genre, but in general. It can be viewed on so many different levels, from political, philosophical, scientific, or simply as a fantastic adventure novel... and it works so well, no matter which angle you look at it from, because Herbert treats each of them as equally important.This is not going to be a long review. My words cannot do this novel justice. I know my abilities as a writer, and I'm just not up to it. All I will say is that I read this book when I was 13 initially, and felt it was the greatest science fiction novel I had ever read at the time. Reading it now in my 30s, I agree with past me completely, but for different reasons. 13 year old me, didn't get the genius of this book. He didn't see what was playing out between the lines. My favorite scene as I read the book this time involved a dinner party. It is quite possibly the most suspenseful scene I've ever read, and when you really look at the scene, all that happens is a very long conversation. It's a constant game of wits where the reader and the characters tries to figure out where the guests' allegiances lie, and while some are clear from the start, others are not so much. I didn't see the depth of this at the time, and even now I feel there is so much hidden in the pages that I only could catch glimpses of... but the world Herbert has created is unforgettable.A full 5/5 stars and my highest possible recommendation.

101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana,Rating 4 out of 5,"I like books for different reasons - characters, writing style, exciting plot. I will remember ""Dune"" for its remarkable world-building.Dune (or Arrakis) is a desert planet. It is barren, almost waterless, and it is the only source of melange - a spice with unique geriatric qualities - it extends lives, enhances mental abilities, and is necessary for space travel. Dune is at the center of an Imperial scheme to bring down the influential House of Atreides led by Duke Leto Atreides. The plan is to give Leto the rights to extract spice on Dune, the rights that previously belonged to Atreides' century-long enemy - House of Harkonnen with Baron Vladimir Harkonnen as its head. The feud between the Houses is later used as a cover-up for the extermination of the House of Atreides. This plan however has a flaw, as it doesn't take into consideration that Leto Atreides's 15-year old son Paul is not an ordinary child, but the end product of a long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human. It's Paul's destiny to give Dune back to its native people - Fremen and to upset the power balance in the Universe. Having finished ""Dune,"" I now understand why this book is considered to be for science fiction what ""Lord of the Rings"" is for fantasy - basically, it's a standard all other works in the genre are compared against. The world of Dune has an unprecedented depth to it. Herbert creates an entire culture built around the world that simply has not enough water. This planetary condition affects Fremen tremendously - they constantly wear stillsuits that are designed to conserve and recycle bodies' water emissions, dead bodies are processed to extract water, the population is controlled to accommodate the a total amount of water available. I found this world extremely interesting and well thought out. The concepts of Bene Gesserit (a school of mental and physical abilities whose hidden mission is to advance humanity through various genetic manipulations), Mentats (people trained for supreme accomplishments of logic, human computers), Missionara Protectiva (a wing of Bene Gesserit order whose goal is to plant superstition on primitive worlds to later make these regions easier for the order to manipulate), etc. are equally fascinating. The depth of the world, however, is the biggest weakness of the book as well as its biggest strength. It takes a while to figure out various concepts and terms which are introduced early on (thankfully, there is a very helpful glossary at the end of the book). The narration is a little too dry at times, especially when characters' mental abilities are explored. The book is in many ways happens inside people's minds, so there is a lot of thinking and analyzing involved. But these negatives aside, ""Dune"" is rightfully called a masterpiece of science fiction. It is much more that a story about aliens and space travel, it is an ambitious philosophical work which explores the issues of ecology, cultural identity and the nature of religious leadership. Although I am not sure I will read the rest of the books in the series (as far as I know the total book count is now 16), I will always remember ""Dune"" as an impressive work of literature which will definitely stand the test of time.P.S. I also watched David Lynch's movie adaptation of the book. My advice - spare yourself, DO NOT watch it. "
102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13459162-edward,Rating 4 out of 5,"Dune, widely considered to be the greatest and most important Science-Fiction novel ever. I haven’t really read, well, any sci-fi before so kicking my foray off with this entry was a great way to start. “Fear is the mind-killer.” We follow a select few Point of Views who are all associated in one way or another, with the desert planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. On Arrakis there is an extreme lack of moisture, a blood-feud between families, a spice called Melange which is invaluable to it’s owner, a tribal society and giant, fearsome, terrifying Sandworms. There is a lot to the history and current affairs of the galaxy and Frank Herbert does an excellent job of exploring many avenues of interest throughout this intriguing planet. “The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.”The Atreides family are the protagonists, all round good guys, with fantastic characters such as Duke Leto, Gurney Halleck, Duncan Idaho, Jessica a ‘Bene Dessert’ concubine and her son Paul Atreides, the heir to the family. There are lots of well crafted relationships within this faction. The blurb of Dune tells us that the family are betrayed and destroyed, and considering it takes quite a few pages to get to that point I’d have much preferred to have been able to figure it out for myself. The opposing faction, the Harkonnen’s are as well crafted as the Atreides, if not even more enjoyable. The slimy and devious Baron Vladmir is a fantastic antagonist. He brutally plots, is clever and there is no evil act that he is not willing to commit to see the downfall of his nemesis Atreides. “The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.”I really enjoy my read of Dune. The prose is very strong, and the descriptions of the world of Arrakis are beautiful. It is science fiction but really not in your face with the science of it all, but it feels very real. Very realistic to the point I forgot it was indeed a sci-fi book. Herbert is a well-rounded storyteller with enough detail of characters, their inhibitions and description, as well as consistent plotting and intrigue. Unfortunately I found Paul, the main character to be the weakest of the cast. I disliked just how much we were in his head and how he was pretty much perfect, but it was written in the 60s and I understand that what modern books I read are trying to steer clear of that approach.“Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You'll find me there, staring out at you!”Still, Dune is a remarkable story and will keep you on the edge of your seat (in your ornithopter). There is so much depth to Dune, the world and its characters. Impressive is the word, really. I would recommend it to to anyone, it covers different preferences and will tick a lot of boxes for lots of people.“Survival is the ability to swim in strange water.”4/5 - a remarkable story written with a distinct style and depth. The characters are individual and intriguing. There is heartbreak, destruction, giant worms, epic duels and a marauding terrifying baby. There are some fantastic quotes too. I am very much looking forward to the film."

So I read it. I know Dune is worshipped as a paragon of groundbreaking SF, I can witness and acknowledge Herbert's genius, and I can understand that when it was written it was certainly seminal, but I still don't think much of it.Aside from Herbert's horribly annoying use of 3rd-person-omnipotent viewpoint, he's just not a good writer. For clarification: he's a fantastic story-teller and creator. He has an incredible imagination and a talent for world-building and interweaving complex storylines. But the actual craft of writing, well, he just can't write worth 2 beans. As a result, I found Dune nearly impossible to get through.Story-wise, I got bored with all the political stuff because it's not my thing, and I got bored with all the preaching about ecology. But I loved the elements that dealt more closely with the human drama, the personal choices characters make, their interactions with others, how they cope internally with themselves and their own strengths and weaknesses. Those are the stories I like. There was enough of that here to make me check out the sequel from the library, but after about 10 pages of Herbert's writing I just couldn't stomach any more."
104,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83419690,Rating 5 out of 5,"The book is brilliant. Delightfully difficult in every sense: from the thoughtful to the smallest details of the Arrakis world order, sophisticated political intrigues, complex interpersonal relationships, to the delightful message with spice.Melange, which has such a diverse spectrum of action (a vital component of interstellar travel, a stimulant that allows you to drive ships through collapsed space), greatly slows down aging, a light drug without abstinence is finally the only place in the universe where they are mined, and there is no way to synthesize, even with the highest level of technology there, which means a monopoly. And whoever owns the Dune owns the world.At least she can dictate terms to him. At the same time, to call this planet the ass of the world would be to flatter her greatly.It's just a scorched desert with nothing but sand, birds like crows, and jumping muaddib mice. Oh, and the worms that started it all. Creatures the size of a car or a house, which live under the sand, but react sensitively to any rhythmic movement on its surface, and when surfaced, they are able to swallow a destroyer in one fell swoop. And the fremen. I listened to the book and all the time I perceived the self-designation of these people as ""freemen"", free, but Vika says that it is necessary to use the ""e"", even so, although they are, in fact, free and quite wild. Like the Tuareg of Earth.Everything in the book is cool. A teenager who is destined to survive in difficult trials and become a ruler. But without the usual fabulous ""honest feast, yes for the wedding,"" ""they lived happily ever after,"" ""I was there, I drank honey and beer, but I only wet my mustache."" A prisoner of prophetic visions provoked by spice (sucha specific influence), he knows from the very beginning that his purpose is not to rule the world or, there, to establish an empire, but to stop jihad. And you will have to put your life on it.That his fate will be inextricably linked with the fate of his mother, whose filial devotion comes into the most severe contradiction with the rebellion of a strong freedom-loving nature against literally cutting according to the patterns prescribed by the Gesserit Order, to which Lady Jessica belongs from infancy. The novel, which was published in the sixty-fifth year of the last century, is an unthinkable Klondike of foresight and insights. Not in terms of fantastic technology, but in political technologies, social trends (what is an order if not the quintessence of feminist ideas?)Эпическая сила- И как там?- Жарко. А воздух наполнен специями.Джейн Остен ""Разум и чувства""""Дюна"" была моей страшилкой последние семь лет. С того времени, как поняла, что обидно, думая о прочитанных книгах ""в себя"", терять со временем львиную долю мыслей, впечатлений, воспоминаний. Завела аккаунты на Либе и в ЖЖ, понемногу стала обрастать знакомствами среди неравнодушных к чтению, и сильно удивилась, когда в одном обсуждении прозвучало spice, на которое не отреагировала узнаванием, что дало собеседнику повод отметить: ""Фантастики вы не любите и не знаете, надо полагать?""- Как это? - возмутилась, - Да фантастика мое все с семи лет.- Но ""Дюну"" не читали.- Это где червяки ползали? (""Они называли тебя червяком, Каа, Большим земляным червяком"") И не собираюсь, мерзость какая. - Так сказала, а читательская гордость осталась ущемленной, какой ты, на фиг, танкист, если не можешь одолеть идиосинкразии, да и прочесть уже. Неважно, что фильм, где из песка выныривали эти громадные твари, не могла досмотреть ни одного разу из тех, что натыкалась на него по ТВ. Соберись уже, тряпка, и сделай это! - каждый раз приказывала себе, вспоминая роман Фрэнка Герберта. Благо, случалось нечасто. До последнего времени.Но в ожидании экранизации от Дени Вильнёва, упоминания о романе скоро станут звучать из каждого утюга, а значит, пришло время. Не надо ждать,не надо звать, а нужно взять, и прочитать. И таки да, книга гениальна. Восхитительно непростая во всех смыслах: от продуманного до мельчайших деталей мироустройства Арракиса, изощренных политических интриг, сложных межличностных отношений, до восхитительного посыла со спайсом.Меланж обладающий таким многообразным спектром действия (жизненно необходимый компонент межзвездных путешествий, стимулятор, позволяющий вести корабли сквозь свернутое пространство), сильно замедляет старение, легкий наркотик без абстиненции - наконец Единственное место во Вселенной, где добывают, и никакой возможности синтезировать, даже при высочайшем уровне тамошних технологий, а значит, монополия. И владеющий Дюной, владеет миром.По крайней мере, может диктовать ему условия. Вместе с тем, назвать эту планету жопой мира, значило бы сильно польстить ей.Просто выжженная пустыня, в которой ничего, кроме песка, птиц вроде ворон, да прыгающих мышей муаддибов. Ах,ну еще черви, с которых все начиналось. Твари, размером когда с легковой автомобиль, когда с дом, которые живут под песком,но чутко реагируют на любое ритмическое движение на его поверхности, а вынырнув, способны одним махом проглотить эсминец. И еще фремены. Книгу слушала и все время воспринимала самоназвание этого народа, как ""freemen"", свободные, но Вика говорит, что надо через ""е"",пусть так, хотя они, в самом деле, свободные и довольно дикие. Как земные туареги.В книге классно все. Подросток, которому судьба выжить в непростых испытаниях и стать повелителем. Но без привычного сказочного ""честным пирком, да за свадебку"", ""жили они долго и счастливо"", ""я там был, мед-пиво пил, да усы лишь обмочил"". Пленник пророческих видений, которые провоцирует специя (такоеспецифическое влияние), он с самого начала знает, что его предназначение не править миром или, там, основать империю, но остановить джихад. И на это придется положить жизнь.Что судьба его будет неразрывно связана с судьбой матери, сыновняя преданность которой вступает в жесточайшее противоречие с бунтом сильной свободолюбивой натуры против буквально обтесывания по лекалам, предписанным орденом Гессерит, которому с младенчества принадлежит леди Джессика. Роман, увидевший свет в шестьдесят пятом году прошлого века, немыслимый Клондайк предвидений и озарений. Не в части фантастической техники, но в политтехнологиях, социальных тенденциях (что есть орден, как не квинтэссенция феминистических идей?)Да, эта книга очень на котурнах, эпос, хотя ни разу ни пеплум. Совершенно продуманная, точная, четкая модель мироустройства и совсем живые герои, вызывающие искренний отклик. ""Дюна"" не мой роман, импринтинга, как с симмонсовым ""Гиперионом"" с ней не случилось. Но вещь гениальная, таки да."
105,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7232207-fiona,Rating 1 out of 5,"I read a few years ago that if you've not found Dune of your own accord by the time you've got to marriageable age, you're probably not a Dune sort of person. I'm sorry, you guys, I've let the side down. 320 pages, and I'm forced to conclude that Paul Atreides and I were never meant to be.When I admitted this to the lender of the book last night, he said some combination of ""ehh, your loss""/""BUT THE WORLDBUILDING"". And that's the thing, worldbuilding alone isn't enough for me. I felt this way about Perdido Street Station when I read it the year before last - the worldbuilding was fabulous, and similarly intricate. But I am the sort of person who enjoys shadow puppetry, who can be given a very few details, and is happy to hang the world off those and concentrate on the action. When you have that almost suffocatingly intricate worldbuilding - and yes, it is very impressive! and so is Miéville's in PSS - then you have passed the point where I can picture it, and you are headed very much towards making me claustrophobic. Dune made me feel claustrophobic, and I didn't like it. I appreciate it for the nods I've seen to it in other media - I bet Jack Glass would be even better now, there's such clear homage to it - especially in terms of the economic system. I'm really happy Frank Herbert did this thing. I just wish he'd done it somewhere else.And the rest feels old to me; it feels stale. It feels like A Christmas Carol when you've seen everyone and the Muppets do their own variations on it. It's like Dracula, terribly self-important and a genre forerunner, but with nothing that still feels fresh, all this time later. I'm glad, of course, that Dracula was written, but mostly because it paved the way for some fantastic things that came after it and because of it. It feels like a piece of backstory, something for the vampire completists. Dune also feels like that.I don't care about Paul, who is a haughty special snowflake, and with whom I can't identify. I don't care about his mother. We wouldn't be friends. There are a few characters I feel the flicker of rooting for (and ""Duncan Idaho"" is the best war hero name I've ever heard). I lost patience with Baron Von Terrible in less than a page. I don't like Arrakis, I wouldn't like to go there. So I don't feel any compulsion towards Dune for its characters' sake, much less its place in sci-fi canon.It's really odd to me, because I want to like hard sci-fi, and I think I like its defining characteristics, its direction and its outlook. Those things are all fascinating. But in a similar way, I like the characteristics and outlook of a lot of romance novels. With both sci-fi and romance, though, if I can't care for the characters, if I can't get excited about the plot, if I can't read the damn prose without something clenching in my stomach, then everything is ruined, no matter how good the idea is.It's strange, I had a similar feeling about a decade ago with Pride and Prejudice, which I later came back to and discovered was a revelation. So all is not completely lost. But in the meantime, Dune, I'm sorry. It's not you, it's me. But also it's you. We just don't have anything to say to each other.(P.S. I don't root for people with concubines. I don't, and you can't make me.)"
106,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13716524-evelina-avalinahsbooks,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved Dune, although I'm not saying some facets of it couldn't be seen as problematic. It's one of those books that I know I'll be rereading, and also one of those books that you know you are not seeing quite the full scope of on your first read through. It's precisely because of that that I will not be reviewing this book on the blog. First of all, it's been reviewed all the times it needs to be reviewed by people much more capable than me – because it's an old and legendary book. Secondly, yes, it's dated, and some of the notions are... not with the times (yes, body image, queer rep, the eugenics, the diversity issues, the white savior complexes... all of that is there and I won't deny it). So I don't really want to delve into it, and also especially because I kind of feel that Dune was bigger than me, and I don't know if I can do it justice.All I can say is that it made me feel so much while I was reading it. And it made me THINK so much. It's one of those rare books that really makes those cogs spin as you're reading it, without it being boring. The book is like a game of chess! It's also basically epic fantasy, posing as scifi. Dune is a phenomenon that I think deserves its own shelf, and I can only marvel at the story-weaving genius that Frank Herbert was.Things I fell in love with in this book:- the Fremen and their incredible culture- the impeccable honor that some of the characters possessed- the philosophy of the Bene Gesserit, despite their awful scheming ways- the slightly New Age vibe to the whole narrative- simply the way it blew my mind with its twisted storytellingYes, of course Dune has problems - mostly because it was written in 1965. But I don't think we shouldn't be able to enjoy it like we enjoy many of the other classics (which are admittedly often much more problematic than Dune.) I truly loved this story. I can recommend it for how smart, ingenious and different it is from anything else I've read. It was quite unforgettable.More Reviews On My Blog | Themed Bookstagram | Quick Update Bookstagram | Bookish Twitter"
107,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,Rating 3 out of 5,"Dune is one of those sci-fi novels where you get hit by a stream of dense, exotic-sounding coinages and no explanations about where we are or what's happening. It reads like there was a prologue which was removed before publication. Our hero, Paul Atreides, is also known as Muad'dib, and having endured the gom jabbar may be the Kwisatz Haderach foretold by the Bene Geserrit as well as the Lisan al-Gaib predicted by the ijaz of the Fremen, otherwise known as Usul in his home sietch…etc.The exposition can be a little clunky at times, too. How's this for subtly introducing the identity of a new character:‘Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?’To which my initial reaction was: Is it not a shit thing that I, the reviewer Warwick Wise, read? Nevertheless, there is a certain charm to it all, the characters are a lot more than cardboard cutouts, and the world-building, prefiguring everything from Star Wars to Game of Thrones, is complex and excellent.The story itself is a very classical hero-narrative (deliberately so – Herbert was a big fan of Joseph Campbell), which moves slowly but has all kinds of interesting details. Perhaps surprisingly, it felt to me like a real product of the 60s in many ways, with a central role given to mind-altering substances and an important ecological theme – the book is dedicated to ‘dry-land ecologists’. (Dune was popularised among the countercultural community after being included in Stuart Brand's Whole Earth Catalog, in a completely unexpected link with my other recent reading.) But all of these factors also make it quite relevant today, not least the depiction of a religiously fanatical desert community being exploited for the hugely profitable substance found by drilling into the sands. Those are all just added extras, though – if you don't enjoy the prospect of a big, sprawling political science-fiction saga then you're not going to get much out of the various subplots.This Folio Society edition is kind of gorgeous, featuring these absolutely exquisite illustrations from Sam Weber, as well as a badly-written afterword from Brian Herbert which does not incline me to read the later sequels he wrote from his father's notes. I probably should have read this twenty years ago, but I'd still consider it a good, foundational piece of sci-fi, which sheds light on several aspects of the tradition and can still be enjoyed plenty for its own sake.

Siete uomini o animali? Fin dove la mente umana può spingersi? Poca azione e tanta riflessione.Herbert presenta una fantascienza involuta sul piano tecnologico proprio per esaltare le capacità umane.Avrete gruppi di umani selezionati, che in mancanza (voluta) della tecnologia si sono specializzati per raggiungere vette mentali e fisiche oltre la concezione di semplice uomo.Le Bene Gesserit: sorellanza dalle capacità psico-fisiche superiori, i Mentat: computer umani, il Bene Tleilax: conoscitori dei segreti della genetica, i Navigatori della Gilda: unici in grado di eseguire i calcoli per viaggiare nello spazio profondo.Tutti umani, ma con capacità al limite del sovraumano, frutto della ferrea specializzazione e selezione genetica avvenuta nel corso di migliaia di anni, archetipi che vi rimarranno in mente per il resto della vostra vita.Di carne al fuoco ce n'è tanta, il primo romanzo mette solo le basi per il vero messaggio epico dell'opera, fermarsi qui è peccato mortale, sta a voi scoprire e capire cos'è il Sentiero Dorato.

Are you men or animals? How far can the human mind go? Little action and a lot of reflection.Herbert presents science fiction that is technologically involved precisely to enhance human capabilities.You will have groups of selected humans, who in the (deliberate) lack of technology have specialized to reach mental and physical heights beyond the conception of simple man.The Bene Gesserit: sisterhood with superior psycho-physical abilities, the Mentat: human computers, the Bene Tleilax: knowledgeable of the secrets of genetics, the Guild Navigators: the only ones capable of performing the calculations to travel in deep space.All human, but with abilities bordering on the superhuman, the result of the iron specialization and genetic selection that took place over thousands of years, archetypes that will remain in your mind for the rest of your life.There is a lot of irons in the fire, the first novel only lays the foundations for the true epic message of the work, stopping here is a mortal sin, it is up to you to discover and understand what the Golden Path is.

110,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,Rating 5 out of 5,"Frank Herbert's science fiction novel 'Dune', first printed in 1965, is the first in his six-book series. There are books after the first six in the series, written by the author's son Brian Herbert and other collaborators after Frank Herbert's death. The six books primarily follow the aristocrat Atreides family through several generations (in fact, millennia - I read all six Frank H. books years ago). I loved them, but I was only a YA at the time. I wasn't sure I would still like them today. Good news! I did still like 'Dune'!However, those readers who prefer action-packed thrillers in which scenes resembling those movie black-ops fights with fast editing cuts predominant will not enjoy 'Dune'.The six Dune books go deep into the science and art of political leadership, especially into those practical facets of how to draw a populace into a revolution or guerrilla insurgency. Also, depending on whether your religious education is shallow or deep, some readers may pick up on the author Frank Herbert's other main theme: ruling political classes everywhere in all times historical and present, and very likely in the future as Frank Herbert so astutely surmises, intentionally and knowingly develop, maintain and manipulate local and world religions as a mechanism to control and direct common people into behaving as the leaders require. Religion is used by leaders on religious believers the same way equestrians control horses through a mouth bit. Political Science majors as well as amateur political junkies and students will snicker knowingly as they read 'Dune', seeing the political-religious manipulations. The rest of us will admire the science-based science fiction world-building. The ‘Dune’ world at the beginning of Herbert's space opera is one of: competing Aristocrat 'Houses' who control planets; the Guild, who control interstellar travel; the Emperor, who is the military/political leader of the large and small Houses; and finally the mystical Bene Gesserit. The Bene Gesserit are actually blackops fems privately, while they publically advise politicos on matters of religion and politics. The Bene Gesserit practice Buddhist-type exercises that control the mind and body. They are also conducting a top-secret genetics program through arranged marriages and concubines. All of these organizations are joined militarily and politically to each other through the business of acquiring a mélange, a sort of a spice, found only on one planet in the universe, the almost waterless Dune, also known as Arrakis. I think Herbert is a genius at hidden irony. He changes what was the work of customarily male missionaries on Earth into a girl-power production in the Dune universe. Almost all religions around the real Earth promise a Messiah of sorts. At this point in our real-time, the Messiah has come (or not) depending on what real-life (primarily Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths) religion Earth believers believe in. The main character in Dune, Paul Atreides, is a Messiah character similar to our current Christian, Jewish or Muslim Messiahs. But in Herbert's plot, Paul is a 'fake news' Messiah created by the Bene Gesserit. They have been spreading around the galaxy rumors, myths and fake mysticism/magic displays for thousands of years, preaching about the coming of a Messiah-like person. The women are publically similar to our real-world Jesuit Catholic/Buddhist proselytizing and practice.Spice is a miracle drug, fueling the minds of some humans who use it regularly with extraordinary mental powers of perception. Without it, the Guild navigators can't navigate through space between thousands of planets, enabling trade and travel, and the aristocrats would not be incredibly wealthy through their awarded shares of Spice profits through the Choam Company, the official Spice sales and distribution company. It follows that whoever controls the mining of Spice on the desert planet Dune, the sole source of Spice, controls also unimaginable access to power and wealth. It is the Emperor's privilege to select among the Great Houses who will be in charge of Dune. The House which is selected must also be responsible for the complete subjugation of the indigenous population, called the Fremen. The various Houses some time ago have had some success with enslaving or brutalizing the locals, but many of the toughened natives escaped and disappeared into the harsh deserts, adopting a lifestyle much like Earth's Middle-eastern tribes in the past. There also are annoying man-eating giant worms who are attracted by any noise in the deserts of Dune, so the mining of Spice deposits, only found in the deserts of Arrakis, is very tricky. No one really knows anything about the dry hot deserts, the worms or where the Spice deposits come from.The Emperor and some of the other Houses do not care what methods of subjugation are used on resident planetary populations. Some Houses use torture and slavery and starvation. Needless to say, the Atreides are good people who desire to win their subjects with love and fairness (not democracy, though). However, the Emperor and another House, the Harkonnens, do not love the Atreides because of past conflicts. The two aristocrat houses come up with a plan to destroy the Atreides House forever. First, at least publicly, the Harkonnens are told to give up their home on Dune and to move out, and the Atreides are ordered to take charge of mining the Spice. Fifteen-year-old Paul Atreides and his mother Jessica, the Duke Leto Atreides' Bene Gesserit concubine, feel very apprehensive about the move. Not only do they feel dismay about leaving their home planet Caladan, a water-rich planet, but all the Atreides' suspect a deadly trap is being set with this supposed honor of being given the control of Dune. The Harkonnens are infamously renown for their methods of subjugation, using torture, rape and robbery freely, not caring who or how many of the indigenous population they kill. What legacy traps have the Harkonnens left behind?There are so many great reviews on Goodreads describing this fantastic novel, I find my usual graphomania has now deserted me. I will instead link to some of those fantastic reviews:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...I also would recommend reading Machiavelli's The Prince before, or definitely after, finishing Dune! However, you should be aware that my recommendation of reading the classic nonfiction book of political advice 'The Prince' (it is very short, btw) carries a hint of the creative approach Frank Herbert took in this fictional series. Paul is a moral hero, but he and his descendants also would have been easily the super-practical Vulcan Political Scientist geniuses in the Star Trek universe. From Paul to his children to his children's children, the aristocrat Atreides House becomes a place of four-dimensional political chess game players plotting for the future of the human race. In ‘Dune’, book one in the Dune series, Paul has to make tough heroic decisions which inspire his fanatical Fremen followers and us, gentle reader. But ultimately, as the series progresses, sentimentality is one of the first things the surviving Atreides jettison."

112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart,Rating 5 out of 5,"Dune: The greatest SF novel of all time, never to be matched by later sequels (Review of 1965 Novel, 1984 David Lynch Film, 2000 Sci-Fi Channel Miniseries, and 2013 Jodorowsky documentary)Originally posted at Fantasy LiteratureWhat more can be said about Frank Herbert’s 1965 masterpiece? This massive epic of political intrigue, messianic heroes, vile villains, invincible desert fighters, telepathic witches, sandworms and spice, guild pilots who fold space, and a relentless action-packed narrative that still has ample room for beautiful descriptive passages and copious philosophizing on the mythology of the messiah/savior. In short, Dune is a perfect SF novel that both entertains and engages the mind, a book frequently cited as the greatest single work of imagination produced in the genre, rivaled only by J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings.And yet the book had a troubled birth, being rejected by over twenty publishers before being accepted by Chilton Books, better known for publishing repair manuals. How could a book later considered a masterpiece be so roundly rejected? The answer lies in the status and expectations of the genre in the 1960s. At the time, SF was still mainly known for its most famous practitioners, Robert Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, and Isaac Asimov, who represented an older Golden Age of SF, focused mainly on science, technology, and space adventure.Dune was a completely new creature, so far ahead of its time with it’s emphasis on a baroque far-future universe dominated by competing Great Houses bound to an Emperor, a guild of space pilots, the matriarchal Bene Gesserit witches, geneticall-modified humans called Mentats that served as computing devices, and the complexities of a galactic economy dependent for commerce on a substance known as the “spice“ mélange that extends health and lifespan, expands consciousness, and most importantly allows the guild pilots to fold space and connect the disparate planets of the Empire. In addition, Frank Herbert was very interested in Middle Eastern cultures and Eastern religions like Zen Buddhism, as well as in desert ecologies and the preciousness of water. Weaving this massive and complex group of themes into a coherent, exciting, and moving narrative following the fate of messiah Paul Atreides, later known Muad’Dib, was a feat that few authors have ever achieved since then, including Frank Herbert himself. In fact, Dune spawned five sequels directly written by Frank Herbert, and then over 10 books that fill in the numerous details of his universe, written by his son Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, who seems to specialize in co-authoring various series such as Star Wars, X-files, and all kinds of novelizations. Most recently his book The Dark Between the Stars was a 2014 Hugo Award nominee. I'm not really interested in reading these spin-off books, when there are so many other books to be read. I did read the five sequels written by Herbert back in high school, and it was a punishing experience, as the first two books (Dune Messiah and Children of Dune) deliberately debunked the messiah mythology established in Dune, showing how the Fremen used Paul Atreides’ status as messiah to wage a destructive jihad across the universe. It’s interesting to hear comments that Herbert intended all along to show what happens when the masses believe in a messiah, and how they participate in the process of creating one. His view is actually quite skeptical, but since Dune is about the rise of the messiah, it benefited from the positive early stage of Paul’s story arc. However, his follow-ups quickly drained my enthusiasm. I guess it should come as no surprise that we prefer to be swept along with the rise of a messianic superbeing, rather than observe the messy aftermath after his rise to power, and various political and religious divisions complicate the world after he takes over. Herbert wanted to explore these themes in great detail, but they were certainly much less commercially-appealing that Dune. I found the next three books (God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, Chapterhouse Dune) more interesting but also very complicated and hard to enjoy. Herbert wrote quite a number of other SF novels outside the Dune universe, but he will always be known best for Dune to the exclusion of his other works, and this must have weighed heavily on him as a writer.The story itself focuses on two feuding families, the House Atreides and House Harkonnen. The latter has been in charge of administering the production of Spice on Arrakis, but as House Atreides has gained in power, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV decided to place the Atreides in charge of Arrakis, with the intention of drawing them into conflict with the Harkonnes and keeping both in check. House Atreides is led by Duke Leto Atreides, his concubine the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica, and Leto’s son Paul, who is part of a secret breeding program to create a Kwisatz Haderach, a male messiah with incredible mental powers who will lead the Bene Gesserit and humanity to greater heights.The levels of intrigue and complexity are staggering, and though a description cannot do it proper justice, Herbert’s complete dedication to his creation recalls the massive world-building achieved by Tolkien in Middle Earth. Despite all the alien concepts, politics, intrigues, warring groups, desert warriors, and mish-mash of Zen Buddism, Islamic and Christian mythology about messiahs and jihads, and the complex economic and ecological implications of the sandworms and spice, the reader is completely drawn into this world and believes in it. It is truly an amazing achievement, recalling how fans embraced George Lucas’ Star Wars universe, but so much more complex, dark, and mature in its themes. As this was the first time I revisited Dune since high school, I decided to get the ensemble-cast audiobook version. It’s complete with sounds effects like the sound of desert winds blowing and ominous music, and these are carefully done not to detract from the narration. A note on the narration, however: the books starts out with a full cast of voice actors, but then switches to a single narrator (Simon Vance?) midway and towards the end, with a few scattered scenes with the full cast. It’s a bit disorienting, especially as the voice of Baron Harkonnen switches from a simpering evil character to a deep-voiced and powerful voice akin to Michael Clarke Duncan. It would have been better to kept the full cast for the entire book, but for some reason it got a bit jumbled. Still, it’s an excellent audiobook production.Jodorowsky’s Dune (2013 documentary; actual movie never filmed)It was inevitable that Dune captured the imaginations of film directors, but the scale and complexity of the story made the transition to film extremely difficult. Film rights were acquired in 1971 but little progress was made until 1974, when a French group acquired the rights and Alejandro Jodorowsky, a Chilean avant-garde film maker, writer/poet and spiritual figure most famous for his 1970 bizarro Western El Topo and The Holy Mountain. His ambitious plans for the film would have reached about 12-20 hours in length, and featured roles for Salvador Dali (lured by ego-stroking), Orson Wells (lured by food and drink), David Carradine, Pink Floyd, Magma, and even Mick Jagger. The artwork would involve the legendary Jean Giraud (of Moebius fame) and H.R. Giger (of Alien fame). Alas, such an ambitious and sprawling project was doomed to failure, and this story is detailed in the 2013 documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune. I watched this recently, and it’s a very revealing portrait of an avante-garde artist. His vision was so wild and hallucinogenic that he said audiences would not need to drop LSD because his film could replicate that experience. His statements about his vision are quite eye-opening:In my version of Dune, the Emperor of the galaxy is insane. He lives on an artificial gold planet, in a gold palace built according to not-laws of antilogical. He lives in symbiosis with a robot identical to him. The resemblance is so perfect that the citizens never know if they are opposite the man or the machine...In my version, the spice is a blue drug with spongy consistency filled with a vegetable-animal life endowed with consciousness, the highest level of consciousness. It does not stop taking all kinds of forms, while stirring up unceasingly. The spice continuously produces the creation of the innumerable universes.I changed the ending, evidently … I did that. It was my Dune. When you make a picture, you must not respect the novel. It’s like, you get married, no? You go with the wife, white, the woman is white, you take the woman, if you respect the woman, you will never have child. You need to open the costume and to rape the bride. And then you will have your picture. I was raping Frank Herbert, raping, like this! But with love, with love.No wonder Frank Herbert disavowed any connection with this project. And despite Jodorowsky’s clear fascination with the source material, he saw no reason not to change it completely. In fact, he hadn’t even read the book when he pitched the idea, and his screenplay demonstrates a willful lack of knowledge of the actual events in the book. It’s not clear that he ever read the book, period, and the same goes for H.R. Giger. Not a biggie when we’re talking about artists, apparently. My ambition with Dune was tremendous. So, what I wanted was to create a prophet. I want to create a prophet... to change the young minds of all the world. For me, Dune will be the coming of a god. Artistical, cinematographical god. For me, it was not to make a picture. It was something deeper. I wanted to make something sacred, free, with new perspective. Open the mind! Because I feel, in that time, myself, inside a prison. My ego, my intellect, I want to open! And I start the fight to make Dune.The documentary suggests that, although the film was never actually made, its influence on other SF film projects is huge, probably because the pitch-book made the rounds of the Hollywood studios. The film can take credit for bringing together Dan O’Bannon (producer of The Dark Star) and H.R. Giger (Swiss artist who created the drawings for Ridley Scott’s Alien), for getting legendary French artist Moebius to make thousands of storyboard sketches and full-color character drawing, and also well-known SF artist Chris Foss to contribute his iconic spaceships. It ends with a series of overlays of the storyboard with actual films, frequently with astonishing similarities in costumes and images, as diverse as Flash Gordon, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, He-Man, and Prometheus. While it’s debatable exactly how much these films were directly inspired, it’s certainly food for thought. So in the end, though it was probably not “The Greatest Film Never Made”, it was an admirably insane and unwieldy project that produced a spurt of creative energy that was simply too much for Hollywood’s commercial studios. It may have been incredible masterpiece, or a complete and utter disaster, but it’s unfortunate that we never got to see Jodorowsky’s mind-altering vision on film. David Lynch’s Dune (1984)After plans for Ridley Scott to direct fell through, it was not until 1981 that Dino De Laurentiis’ daughter approached David Lynch to bring Dune to the big screen. Wait, you mean the director of Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, and Twin Peaks? That’s right. It’s still a mystery why Lynch chose to direct Dune, since he had not shown interest in the SF genre and had not even read the book (a common theme here). But to his credit, he made a valiant effort to put on film this notoriously difficult and sprawling work.As could have been predicted, the Lynch film was severely panned by film critics, moviegoers, and fans of the novel. It was dark, confusing, and incoherent (due to excessive cutting to get it to 2 hrs 17 min in length), and the Baron Harkonnen was so physically revolting to look at that I had to turn away from some of his scenes. But it did feature a great soundtrack by Toto (especially the haunting closing credits) with the prophecy theme written by Brian Eno. And it I will never forget Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides in the final climactic scene, a knife fight to the death with Feyd Rautha Harkonnen, played perfectly by Sting! Even Sean Young and Patrick Stewart have important roles as Chani and Gurney Halleck. But this was another doomed attempt. Try to imagine cramming all the plot details, background information on the political machinations of the dozens of characters and factions, details on the complex ecology of Arrakis, the relationship of the sandworms and spice, the Fremen and Bene Gesserit, into a film just over 2 hours long. The studio’s demands for cuts were so drastic that Lynch has since dissociated himself from the film and refuses to talk about it. That’s a shame, because many have revised their initial negative views on the film and I consider it a valiant if failed attempt at scaling the Everest of SF films.Sci Fi Channel Miniseries (2000; Director’s Cut: 295 min)This is by far the least well-known version of Frank Herbert’s SF masterpiece. In fact, it’s not easy to get a copy as it’s not available for sale new on DVD or download. That should have set off alarm bells, but what the heck, I had to see for myself. I finally had to order a used DVD copy on Amazon. Big mistake~What can I say other than, “Oh the humanity!” I’m fully aware that a TV miniseries does not have access to the same budget resources, A-list actors, top-notch special effects, and artistic talent. But what a disaster this was. Within a few minutes I knew I was along for a long and painful ride. Every frame is amateurish, the amount of inept fight scenes and obvious blue-screen work made me suppress chuckles, but that was only topped by the hopelessly wooden acting of a cast of unknowns expect for William Hurt, who must have deliberately toned it down not to make the others feel bad. The entire production is clumsy through-and-through, and the only redeeming feature is that the costumes in the film are SO OUTLANDISH that they provide entertainment of a different sort. For example, the stillsuits of the Fremen, which looked believable in the Lynch film, have become flimsy green-camouflaged rain jackets found in the discount bin:https://mialacostumes.files.wordpress...And the Fremen themselves are just low-rate extras from a different back-lot set filming Middle-Eastern marketplace scenes. Even more gut-busting were the blatant samurai armor rip-offs that passed for Harkonnen soldiers’ armor:http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/v...If that wasn’t enough, the Imperial Sardaukar storm troopers, supposedly the most lethal and feared fighters in the galaxy, had silly black headgear like this:https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/... Finally, I had to save a special place for the ridiculous outfits of the Guild Navigators’ representatives:http://dvdmedia.ign.com/dvd/image/dun...It’s easy to ridicule film-making this bad, but I have to give credit for one thing. One of the fatal flaws of Lynch’s Dune was that it tried to cram an incredibly-complex SF epic into just 2 hours+ of film (unwillingly, I know). So anyone familiar with the book could lament the wholesale destruction of the plot to force the story into that timeframe. It’s no surprise that most critics and viewers unfamiliar with the book were completely lost. Well, the mini-series does put back in dozens of story arcs to make it much more faithful to the book, and that was appreciated. It’s easier to recognize the source material in this version, but the poor production and acting quickly torpedo this.In fact, the miniseries essentially re-shoots almost the entire Lynch film, scene by scene, in an attempt to do it ‘better’. There are hardly any scenes left untouched, but I couldn’t help thinking I preferred the actors and cinematography of the Lynch film in almost every case. I can imagine the producers pitching this project as “let’s do Dune again, and get it right this time.” Well, I second those feelings, but this was not it, not by a long shot. Judging from the recent prominence of big-budget cable TV productions like Game of Thrones, Man in the High Castle, the 300, the Expanse, and the vast improvement in special effects, it strikes me that Dune is ripe for another adaptation, and could easily fill several quality seasons in the right hands. Imagine the creative team of GOT getting behind this project – it could be amazing. Because Dune the book has yet to be done justice, so there’s a great opportunity here for a skilled team. Any takers?"
113,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5942822-alan,Rating 5 out of 5,"I won’t touch my review from October 2021, which is the first time I read this. I will say that the second reading has seen Dune go up to 5 stars. I delved into the appendixes carefully, taking out much more than I could have with a simple reading of the text. I was also a constant fan of Princess Irulan’s words at the beginning of each chapter, with her “literary aspirations”. -----------------------------------[October 2021]I think I fall into a different “stream” of reading when I am engaged with fantasy or sci fi. Literary fiction, the classics, etc. force you to stop, look around, interact with all of the elements of the story. Often, they are not even about the story – as I am so fond of pointing it repeatedly. With fantasy and with sci fi, I fall into the story hole. I am interested in the next action scene and the next character interaction, often not stopping to take a look at my surroundings. As a result, I find that I sometimes derive more pure, instantaneous pleasure from these genres than the classics; on the other hand, I feel that I am unable to read them nearly as close as I would ideally want to.Dune has the privilege of being a sci fi and a classic – it’s a book that I have grappled with for most of my life. I was always able to read similar stories, no matter my age or maturity. The first page of this book, however, always defeated me. Frank Herbert artfully (and cruelly) tosses you into the deep end. As a relatively inexperienced reader of sci fi, seeing these words all on the same page would always cause a mini heart attack: Bene Gesserit, Muad’Dib, Shaddam, Arrakis, Caladan, Irulan, Atreides. What the hell does it all mean? There is no linear introduction, no “info dump”, nothing to catch you up. Suddenly you are waking up with Paul Atreides, ready to meet up with the old crone, ready to put your hand into the gom jabbar, whatever the hell that is. My friend gave me my own copy of this book in 2019 as a Christmas gift – beautifully orange, and luckily (despite what shows up here on Goodreads) without the “Soon to be a Major Motion Picture”. The plan was for me to read the book before the 2020 release of the movie. That got pushed and so did my plans. This month, I knew I had about 15 days to finish the book – I am seeing the movie this Thursday. Well, I am done. And it was done relatively quickly.It’s a bit of an understatement to say that the reading of the book was made much easier by the fact that I can speak/read Persian. I found myself rarely having to refer to the “Terminology of the Imperium” section included in the back of the book – a neat and extensive dictionary of the words used around the story, often by the natives of Arrakis, the Fremen. This gave the world a bit more gravity, allowing me to buy in. Of course, one of the main terms, Lisan al-Gaib, is a title given to the Persian poet Hafez. I was walking through familiar territory.As for the story itself, it was gripping. I could recognize its influence on modern day sci fi and fantasy (e.g., Star Wars, Game of Thrones, etc.), but found it sufficiently deep in its own right. The world of Dune is very intricate. Maybe Herbert was not as in-depth as a Tolkien, but is anyone ever really as in-depth as Tolkien? I found myself constantly anticipating the approach of the worms – I could sense a rumble, a slow build-up, a storm of noise, all coming to a head as this otherworldly freight train barreled through the sand. The characters were believable enough, human enough, though slightly over the top at times. I mean, come on, the Harkonnens were pantomime villains if I had ever read any. Apart from that, I found the motivation of the other characters relatable. No flaws there. Did they act like blatant fools at times? Absolutely. But again, we all do at times, don’t we?A book rich with ideas, philosophy, and quotes that can be savored every day. I would benefit from another read through of the series in a few years, coming back to it while knowing the story, not trying to situate myself constantly. A good stand-alone book, but I am looking forward to seeing how the universe of Dune will expand over the next 5 books."
114,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/599298-nastja,Rating 2 out of 5,"Довольно сложно написать что-то о важном для многих романе, который тебе скорее не понравился, так, чтобы никого не обидеть, поэтому я отмела краткие рецензии, сводившиеся, в основном к тому, что фразу «производители спайса ждут прихода мессии» можно в принципе читать как знаменитое «мальчик в клубе склеил модель», да еще к тому, что это, в целом, книга о том, как хорошие наркоторговцы победили плохих, и решила написать чуть-чуть подробнее (и подобрее), почему я с этим романом все-таки разошлась, нигде не соприкоснувшись.Конечно, нельзя отрицать того, что Герберт придумал очень простроенный и логичный мир. Здесь все, от костюмов, которые утилизируют телесную влагу, до сложного механизма обучения Бене Гессерит, выглядит продуманным и не вызывает острого читательского неверия, как это бывает, когда автор создает новый мир, а он все равно оказывается подшивкой за 1969. Здесь есть сюжет с правильно расположенными точками напряжения, аккуратным и верным переключением сцен и хорошо отлаженным общим конфликтом. Здесь даже есть некоторая осязаемость иномирья, прорывающаяся то памятью о водах Каладана, то многолуньем над пустынями, и думаю, если все это прочесть лет этак в пятнадцать, когда не то что многие сюжеты, а многие слова еще кажутся новенькими, рождающимися прямо на странице, и само чтение так увлекает, потому что оно с нами только начинается, – тогда «Дюну», с ритуальностью многих ее сцен, с понятной рельефностью ее диалогов, с доступной философией и впрямь можно полюбить. Но, я боюсь, что после определенного возраста она превращается в тыкву, и тогда уже невозможно игнорировать то, что между читателем и героями встает какая-то зеркальная стена, которая не дает их хоть как-то прочувствовать, потому что они или не меняются, как Пол и Джессика, которые сразу умели много гитик, а потом просто стали уметь всё, или исчезают, не успев толком встроиться в историю, как Дункан Айдахо или доктор Кайнз, в общем, сразу выходят из головы Герберта в полном облачении и в нем же уходят, преследуемые постоянными эпитетами и конструкциями. Чани всегда elfin-faced, Халлек состоит из шрама и цитат, герцога Лето должен был играть Шон Бин и так далее. И если в относительно юном возрасте (или при каком-то отсутствии долгого читательского прошлого) у тебя еще есть это волшебное умение достроить в голове недостающее, поразиться впервые виденному, поделиться с картоном дыханием, оживить его как палку-скакалку, оседлав которую ты в детстве вмиг становишься как минимум Михаилом Боярским, то с уходом времени уходит и волшебство, увы. И ты замечаешь только неразвитые предпосылки, необъяснимые характеры, надерганные отовсюду безо всякого смысла trava korenja okolo и обороты вроде Jessica held herself to stillness lest she disturb the hyperfunctioning of his mind, и так 700 страниц подряд: калейдоскоп удивительных сюжетов, разыгранный тенями на стене. Простите, в общем. Ваша бабушка очень старалась, но она team Тургенев."

116,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7467113-mark,Rating 5 out of 5,"There are so many reasons I shouldn’t love this book. The characters often feel distant. The prose style, while technically competent, can be stuffy and is not always engaging. There are long stretches where it feels like the plot is moving forward at a snail’s pace. Made-up words are hurled at the reader at every turn. And, considering the 1965 publication date, there are certain elements like gender dynamics which simply didn’t age well and had me rolling my eyes from time to time. And yet.For whatever reason (or combination of reasons), I love this book. Love it wholeheartedly and absolutely. There is something that just feels so brilliant, so awe-inspiring, that instilled in me a sense of wonder I haven’t felt in years. Worldbuilding has always come secondary to me, as I prefer to focus more on characters and story, but this is the first time I can recall an actual setting being so impressive to me. I became obsessed with Dune. When I wasn’t reading it, I was thinking about it, daydreaming about the harsh world of Arrakis. Even though I’d already purchased the ebook version and was 60% through, I still spent another $30 on the beautiful deluxe hardcover, and began rereading it from the beginning.Why? Because I could tell this novel was something special for me. I knew it was something I wanted to cherish in my physical book collection, something I could perhaps revisit. I am so happy to have discovered this wondrous world. Despite the warnings of many trusted GR friends, I plan to dive headfirst into the rest of the series. I just can’t help myself. So what is it that made me love this so much? I’m really not sure. It could be the age-old feeling of epic storytelling, filled with prophecy and heroic archetypes. It could be the underlying philosophy and thematic resonance, layers upon layers that touch upon things like politics, economics, ecology, and more. And despite not really liking many of the characters (including Paul, who I'm not convinced we are even supposed to like), there were some who I really grew to care about... Jessica, Chani, Gurney, Hawat, and even Alia**! And particularly near the end of the book, there were a few emotionally-stirring moments. Or maybe it was the sandworms.**"
117,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1994-keith-mukai,Rating 5 out of 5,"I guess I'm one of the few that bridge the gap between the Pride and Prejudice camp and the Dune camp. I loved both.Dune isn't a light, enjoyable read. At times it reads more like excerpts from geology, ecology, zoology, sociology, pscyhology, and political textbooks. The characters are more like mega-archetypes than real human beings.The appeal of Dune is peculiar. In order to enjoy Dune you have to enjoy complexity. All authors create little worlds in their stories but Herbert created a world.He doesn't just say that Arrakis is a desert planet, he engrosses himself and the reader into the geology.He puts people on the planet, governments, conflicting cultures, conflicting religions, conflicting ways of life that are thought out to the Nth level above and beyond anything else I've ever read. You could write a sociology or politics dissertation on the societal relations Herbert conceived for Dune.Now is complexity itself a thing to be admired in a work of fiction? Generally no, but Dune is so immense and so detailed that it creates and inhabits a category of its own. The very fact that it often reads more like a National Geographic article than a sci-fi novel speaks to its peculiar charm.Admittedly, this will not appeal to everyone. In fact, odds are that it will appeal to hardly anyone. But limited appeal should in no way factor into a work's quality. Compare the Academy Award-winning films against the yearly box office numbers if you don't agree. I'm sure Armaggeddon outgrossed Monster's Ball.And amidst all this complexity lies a kind of new myth that blends mysticism, religion, and crass real-world politics. It's a hybrid; it's not The Odyssey and it's certainly not Star Wars but I do find great appeal in its particular take on Campbell's hero's journey. And the fact that it plumbs the intricacies of Muslim/Arab/desert culture adds another layer of exotic flair to the work.As if all that wasn't ambitious enough, it even articulates a fascinatingly dark but pragmatic destiny for humanity as a whole.And all of these incredibly ambitious elements are all tightly woven together. Take out one element and the story loses its cohesion. Despite all the ridiculous amounts of detail there is nothing extraneous in this novel.Dune is a remarkable, magnificent accomplishment. But it's okay if it's not to your taste."
118,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9854601-olivier-delaye,Rating 5 out of 5,"Dune came out in 1965, but it might have been yesterday. Indeed, this book just doesn’t seem to age at all! This is mainly due to the fact that by eradicating all form of computerized technology from his story, Frank Herbert managed with great talent to render it timeless while simultaneously anchoring it to the foundation of the Science Fiction genre. So many SF books written in the 60’s, 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s come across as dated simply because the pseudo-technologies that then were amazing to the readers now seem downright ridiculous and even laughable. Not so with Dune. Dune is here to stay. Add to this an amazing world-building, well-crafted characters and unforgettable villains, a twisting plot tackling among other things some still-very-up-to-date-and-even-more-so-nowadays environmental issues, deep-but-very-accessible gems of philosophy dispatched here and there within the text and at the beginning of each chapter, and you have here one of the most successful and influential piece of Science Fiction literature of all time.

122,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36819318-scott,Rating 5 out of 5,"High up in the clouds ringing the Science Fiction Olympus, at the very peak of the mountain of the writing gods, sits Frank Herbert, seated on a throne of crisp, first-edition copies of Dune, a golden, sandworm-shaped staff in his right hand.Herbert is an SF deity, and his elevation to godhood comes from one book, and one book alone. Sure he wrote a bunch of other novels, several of which continue the story started in Dune, and several of which are interesting reads. None of them, however, equalled the impact of his most famous work, and the book his name has become synonymous with.Dune is central to science fiction. You can't call yourself an SF fan if you haven't read it, or at least attempted to do so.This is an epic novel, one of the true classics of the genre along with books like Frankenstein, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. The Forever War, Wasp and Hyperion. Herbert introduces readers to an interstellar empire founded on Melange - also known as Spice - an addictive substance that profoundly alters its users, allowing them to fold spacetime and travel vast distances instantaneously, a substance found only on the planet Arrakis. He shows us two noble families competing for the favour of their emperor and the control of the harvesting of this substance. In the great deserts of Arrakis he brings us to gigantic sandworms that hunt via the vibrations of footsteps. Finally we meet the Fremen of the arid wastes who survive wearing stillsuits that recycle their sweat, their urine, even the moisture they exhale. All of this exists in a deep and convincing future that is utterly computer-less, the result of an AI-led war centuries prior that has seen thinking machines of any type destroyed without mercy wherever they are found. In this future the work of AIs is done by hyper-enhanced and trained humans called mentats, who serve where computers once did.Into this strange world comes Paul Atreides, a young heir to a noble house, betrayed and marooned in the desert, but destined to change entirely the universe in which he has grown up. His story is a big one, and it will stick with you.It's all heady, imagination-firing stuff, and just thinking about it thrills me with the limitless potential of the SF genre.Dune's influence is incalculable. references to it turn up in every medium, from the intelligence enhancing 'mentats' tablets in the Fallout games, through to worm sign in Spongebob Squarepants and a whole load of setting and characters in Star Wars. It looms in the subconscious of anyone writing in this genre, whether they are aware of it or not.The reputation of this book is well earned. It’s a damn fine story, and an astonishing feat of imagination. Read it. You’ll probably love it, and even if you don’t you’ll learn a lot about SF and the major influences in the genre."

Another buddy read with the awesomest of friends, TS, Emma and Celeste, is done!Turns out we need not have rushed to read this one before the movie, but in hindsight, this writing was on the wall. As for the story, I went into this not expecting to enjoy it much, and I was pleasantly surprised, at least for a while.Dune is of course, much loved and very well known as a staple of the science fiction genre and reading this for the first time I can very much see why. The story turned about to be a bit of a page turner, up to a point, filled with themes of power, control, religion, politics and family, all wrapped up in a intriguing promised one type plot with some excellent world-building and fascinating characters. And while I can easily say that Dune has stood the test of time and I am happy to have read it, my excitement for the story got lost a bit in all the philosophy and the weirder moments in the book, and lastly the ending which left quite a bit to be desired. All in all a very enjoyable read though."
124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly,Rating 4 out of 5,"There's so much great science fiction writing out there now that you forget that it used to be a looked down upon stepchild of ""serious literature"". Frank Herbert was one of the authors who caused this evolution of science fiction from ""the natural child of someone"" to great art in and of itself. A great story well told, Dune has a few tiny discomforts for the modern reader; such as the slight misogyny of the sisterhood of the Bene Gesserit witches and Paul's contemptuous treatment of his mother in the desert. One of the signs to look for in any work for the treatment of women is are they concerned with more than just their sons and husbands and do they have power. In this, Herbert is guilty of the first, Lady Jessica, not even the wife of her royal husband, but his concubine, is mostly concerned with son and husband. For the second part though, she does have immense power and can use the power of her voice to control men. She and Paul, her son and future leader, take an impromptu trip through the harsh desert and come upon the fremen who have made a rich life in the barren terrain. This voyage is one of the strongest parts of the story and shows Lady Jessica as a powerful figure herself. The dynamic push and pull between mother and son prefigures the trap that Paul may fall into as he becomes a messianic leader."

The sort of politics-heavy, languidly-paced, intellectually-stimulating beast that my mind respects more than my emotions connect with. I don't know what it is about this book in particular that I never clicked with because I've loved other dense, cerebral, worldbuilding sci-fi books that are similar thematically, and this is sort of the granddaddy of them all. I think part of it is that I never became fully invested in the characters. I also felt like I was working too hard for it to be the transportive, escapist masterpiece I was expecting. During much of the middle I would frequently find myself thinking ""I'd rather just watch the movie condensed to only the best bits than spend so much time here."" I realize that's blasphemy to most book enthusiasts, and fans of this book in particular. Whoops. But let me tell you, I am pumped about the new movie adaptation coming out later this year! I think director Denis Villneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) is a genius so providing the screenwriters (including Eric Roth of Forrest Gump and Benjamin Button) get it right and it's edited tightly, it has the potential to be the Dune I've been hoping for.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"
126,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24672869-nastya,Rating 4 out of 5,"Some books give so much more on a reread.This time I had no problems with the pacing. Don’t get me wrong, this is not a page-turner, this book is to be savored in a leisurely manner, one glorious set-piece after the other. I had no problem with Chani romance this time, there’s something precious and beautiful in a love story that has no start, making it a love without borders of time. And I just tend to enjoy the melancholy mood of the piece, the tragedy of great noble people failing, the tragic fate of Paul’s leadership and zealotry of the people whose actions become his responsibility. This is a beautiful book full of pathos with a meh ending, but what can you do? Satisfying endings are hard, and it's not like this is the real ending of this story. And no, I haven’t seen the movie. Previous thoughts:This book is an ancient greek epic written by Homer but in space.First few hundred pages are a bit dense and a lot of people I know stopped reading in the beginning. But if you keep going, you’ll find a unique and epic world. I see where Stargate, Star Wars, Avatar and even Tremors got inspirations. A lot of politics, religion and even magic. It’s a plot or maybe even idea driven story. Characters are not very complex. And I don’t know if I caught everything on the first reading. We have a lot of inner monologues and all big battles happened behind the scenes.I’ve read the whole book and I cannot tell you what Paul's personality is except he is a chosen one(in this book at least). Lady Jessica is a ninja and spiritual leader and the best character. Baron did not age well (he is the most evil disgusting fat guy who cannot even stand by himself and also only homosexual and rapist. yikes) Great love of Paul and Chani came to be because they foresaw their love. And then it happened between chapters. And I really disliked Chani. There was nothing to her. I hope in the movie they’ll give her a personality. But I loved Arrakis. And I want to see it on a big screen."

Και ένα τέτοιο βιβλίο είναι το Dune.Δεν εννοώ βέβαια πως η επιστημονική φαντασία υπάρχει λόγω του Dune, αλλά πως η ιστορία της επιστημονικής φαντασίας θα έβγαζε κάποια στιγμή ένα Dune: Που θα δημίουργήσει με μαεστρία έναν κόσμο από μηδέν, που θα χρησιμοποιήσει αρχετυπικούς χαρακτήρες για να πει όσα θέλει, που θα μιλήσει μέσα από το δημιούργημα του για τον κόσμο του σήμερα.Φιλοσοφία, οικολογία, πολιτική, θρησκεία και θρησκοληψία, παραδόσεις, κοινωνιολογία, τι σημαίνει να ηγείσαι, θέματα που συνταιριάζουν το ρεαλισμό που γνωρίζουμε εμείς με τη space opera που ξεπήδησε από το μυαλό του Herbert.Δε με κούρασε, παρότι ακούω πως σε πολλούς αρκετά σημεία του μοιάζουν αργά και βαρετά. Ο τρόπος που μπλέκει ο συγγραφέας τις ιστοριογραμμές του για να αναπτύξει τα θέματα του Dune, και μάλιστα κάνοντας το αυτό χτίζοντας ένα μοναδικό κόσμο, με κέρδισε από τις πρώτες σελίδες. Θυμήθηκα σε σημεία του τον Tolkien, το Star Wars, τα λόγια του Muad'Dib μου φέραν στο μυαλό εκείνα του Roland στο Dark Tower του King.Δεν έχω κάτι παραπάνω να πω, δεν μπορώ να πω και πολλά. Θεωρώ το Dune ένα αριστούργημα, όχι απλά για την επιστημονική φαντασία, αλλά για τη λογοτεχνία γενικότερα.Τώρα πρέπει να δω την ταινία του David Lynch [που ναι, δεν έχω δει ποτέ] και μετά να βάλω το Jodorowsky's Dune, το ντοκιμαντέρ για τη θρυλική κινηματογραφική μεταφορά του Jodorowsky που δε γυρίστηκε ποτέ, πιστεύω θα αξίζει να το ξαναδώ τώρα που διάβασα το βιβλίο.Dune: ★★★★½"

132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6755739-mark,Rating 5 out of 5,"I did buy the new and beautifull edition celebrating its original publishing in 1965 and expected movie this year, which was the one movie I was really looking forward this year and with Covid-19 being the factor that stopped this party I decided to reread this novel once more.As a fifteen old kid who kept annoying the ladies of my local library with my great thirst for reading books they had decided to offer me some books to keep me busy. First of was Lord of the Rings by one Tolkien which got devoured with a speed they considered somewhat unsettling they then gave me this book Dune a scifi book. With my scifi taste being mostly Star Trek and Star Wars this book was of course an eye opener and something of new territory for a young kid. For I while I read quite a lot of scifi, classics and whatnot but Dune and its sequels always remained special.I did read the three sequels, Messiah, Children and God Emperor and was and am still today totally in awe of these books. When I discovered the next two Frank Herbert books I put one on my reading list for English and my teacher who turned out to be a fan too disputed that books existence. Until I put it on his desk and he decided that afternoon to visit the bookstore to obtain a copy and during my oral exam we did discuss this book and I am sure I learned a lot of insight from this English teacher more than he learned from his student. But this teacher loved students that read and came up with different choices than the average student who read because they must. Anyhow this phenomenal Scifi book tells a story about a duke and his family whom get displaced from their own watery world to a desert world where the article Spice is being found and its application is considered to be a boon to health, prescience and is actually very important in Spaceflight by the Guild navigators. It is difficult to not slip into information later learned in the sequels Messiah & Children because they feel actually not like book 2 & 3 but part of the original tale of Dune.Paul Atreides loses his father to the treacherous Harkonnen on the planet Arrakis also know as Dune. He becomes the leader of the desert people that inhabit the planet and leads them on a path to religious Jihad and throw the other houses of the Landsraad and the Emperor aside.This sounds like a lot of action but most of the story is weaving a new world and its secrets and culture. There is so much to be enjoyed in Frank Herberts creation and often you are left in some bewilderment how one man could make up so much different cultures of humanity and there is not an alien around.My advise would be to read the three books that make up the story of the Atreides and the genetic line they represent and the duty they have for the Universe.Recognize the prescience that leaves Paul Atreides some choices and he is definitely afraid of his choices and the future he will create. This story tells about a special young man who is meant to change the universe and yet is terribly afraid for the future he will create and yet must do so or die and leave the universe in danger for the future. The story represents some Greek tragedy which admittingly was also some of Frank Herberts source/inspiration, the foreword by Brian Herbert who went on to enlarge his fathers Duniverse does give you some insight in his fathers writing and thinking. For me the Bene Gesserit have always been the most fascinating of creations and considering their role in the Duniverse they were important too for Frank Herbert. It is their part in the story that gets everything rolling.This particular copy is absolutely beautiful and one might hope that the next two installments also get the same treatment with a new release as there is plenty of time and need before we get to see the movie next year. They actually deserve the same respect as they are one story and it would look amazing on my bookshelves of course. "
133,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8759700-denisse,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 Complex and incredibly well crafted: Dune. Slow introduction, heavy politics, long descriptions, clever dialogue, smart exposition, critical to the world. A classic. An obvious inspiration for so many to come, with a fascinating fictional science. The author takes his time for everything, and because of that, the ending is brilliant. You got to be patient, Dune delivers.Relectura: No recordaba mucho de lo que pasaba y creo que en esta ocasión pude apreciar la historia mejor, además de dejarme ahora si con ganas de leer la continuación. Prestándole atención es obvio en donde estaba el interés del autor, hay paginas enteras de dialogo interno de los personajes, descripciones largas y detalladas de lugares y en cambio el desenlace ocurre en apenas unas 30 páginas. Y aun hay algo que me separa de la historia, sigo sin saber que es. Pero la recomendación sigue, Dune tuvo tanta influencia en su género que no darle la oportunidad es una perdida.  A continuación mi reseña original recortada porque estaba demasiado larga. 
«Dios creo Arrakis para probar a los fieles.»
Los apéndices es lo que marca la diferencia entre un gran libro y una obra.No saben lo mucho que me gusta leer una historia que se sienta como un trabajo hecho a conciencia. Dune es para lectores pacientes. Es una lectura tan completa que algo en el picara tu curiosidad. La trama vista de manera general puede que sea sencilla, pero a detalle se vuelve casi inabarcable. La introducción es enorme, el universo creado muy basto y las subtramas, que incluyen mucha filosofía sobre religión, liderazgo, sociedad y ecología, muy directas. El dialogo entre personajes es muy inteligente, y lo menciono por que un dialogo flojo a mi muy particularmente me puede arruinar un libro. En general es un trabajo muy bien logrado. Si hay o no simbolismos a acciones de nuestro pasado o referencias a nuestras religiones ya dependerá de ti y de que tanta atención le prestes. Pero en su forma más ligera; Dune es un libro de ciencia ficción político con un gran mensaje ecológico y de liderazgo. Advertencia: Al inicio de cada capítulo hay extractos y referencias a libros del mismo mundo de ficción, algunos sirven bastante pero otros te spoilean todo el condenado capitulo. ¡¿Como porque rayos?!

Me encantó la película y ha sido muy fiel al libro, aunque no lo incluyen todo. Me ha flipado la creación del mundo y la cantidad de detalle que hay a lo largo de la narración. El autor le ha dado vida a un universo muy rico y complejo y ha sido lo que más he disfrutado de la novela. También me ha encantado toda la carga política, religiosa y de intriga de la novela: traiciones, intrigas políticas dentro de más intrigas, cómo funcionan las casas... Ha sido impresionate. No tengo más que decir, ha sido una novela soberbia y ahora entiendo el amor que se le tiene y me uno a el.

I do not care if it can be read as a futuristic reimagining of the Book of Exodus, or if it informed the zeitgeist of early Nerd Culture. This book is boring. Even the action scenes are boring. Even the cool and interesting parts of the setting are boring. Frank Herbert sure could imagine a detailed, internally consistent, unique and symbolic world, and having read his work will certainly help me answer a few questions at trivia night. But he can't hold my attention for beans."
136,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77983193-zitong-ren,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ok, so, this was good, but it wasn’t amazing necessarily looking at it from a more modern lens, but I certainly respect it a lot for what it has done for the genre. My rating is really 3.5 stars, it’s just above a three, but also not quite a four, but ya know, Goodreads doesn’t have half stars, so I’ve just rounded it up to a four. Just as a note, I haven’t read a huge number of sci-fi novels, especially more classic sci-fi, like this novel is, so I don’t have a lot of older works to compare my review of Dune with, and everything is just my opinion here, as reviews as subjective.For the characters, I found them to be alright. They weren’t the most amazing, but nor were they horrible and there were certainly some really nice moments between them. Compared to some of the stuff by more modern authors, I would have preferred for them to have stronger voices and more to separate them between each other. Some of the characters felt like they were sort of just there to advance the plot, or have the character go in a certain direction. I was sort of surprised at how much of the book, especially in the first half that spent a lot of time following Jessica, but I was fine with that as she was an interesting character, though she did become a lot less relevant in the third part. Paul was fine, he’s essentially the chosen one and it played out in an interesting, though not amazing way.The world was really nice, as I expected. One thing about Dune that I have heard is at how groundbreaking the world was for its time and what it did for sci-fi, much like LOTR did for fantasy. I certainly agree with that and especially for its time, would have been amazing. There definitely was a lot of depth to the world, and it was a pretty complex, with a chunky appendix at the end that really built up it well. The book is largely spent on the planet of Arrakis, which was interesting in how the world worked and functioned, and the Fremen were fascinating to read about. In my view, the world was probably the strongest element of the world for me. Compared to some of the stuff that I’ve read in the fantasy genre(I know this is sci-fi), it doesn’t stand out as much, though it certainly is still good. There were also some more fantastical elements that I wasn’t aware was in it before I started reading it, as I initially though it was hard sci-fi, when in reality, it is more sci-fantasy, which was cool.I don’t know if I would say if I really vibe with the writing style. For the most part it was fine, though there were a few things that sort of pulled me out from being immersed all the time. I don’t know if I liked at how, while yes, it’s told in third person, the actual point of view kept switching every few paragraphs sometimes so that we followed the thought process of different people and that was just jarring to me. There was also the whole a-h-h-h, or wel-l-l-l in dialogue, that sort of bothered me because you just never see it done anymore and it’s less a critique of his writing, but rather just that I could not get accustomed to it. There were also lots of character thought written all in italics, and for some reason that managed to take me out of being fully immersed in the text.The plot was decent, if not somewhat predictable in many of the events. We do spend some time following the antagonists in the story, so that gives us a bit of view of sort of where the plot is going. I would like to think that for its time, where plots weren’t always super strong, it would have been really good for sure. I enjoyed the ending of this and clearly leaves a lot of stuff for the story to move ahead in for the rest of the series. It wasn’t brilliant of an ending, but it was still good, if that makes sense. I honestly at this point don’t know if I will continue with the series, as I have heard mixed things about the sequels. Either way, this book wrapped up nicely by itself, so I don’t really have too much of an urge to read on.One area in the plot that I didn’t love was the significant time jump between Parts 2 and 3, where I think two-three years pass in a blink of an eye. The author also doesn’t tell you this and you do have to figure it yourself, which look, was fine, I had no problem with that. My main issue with the time jump is that a fair number of significant events occur during that time frame, including some important things for the main characters. Now, when we hear of these things or when events occur, as the reader, I didn’t really feel any sort of connection to some events in Part 3 that were important to the characters, but I just couldn’t care much about it. Maybe smaller and gradual time jumps would have helped, considering this occurs two thirds through the book as the sudden jump was jarring. I’m perfectly fine with time jumps at the start of books, or between books, but near the end was sort of just weird for me personally. I have seen this in Feist’s  Magician, so maybe it was more common in classic works, I don’t know.I would say that it has aged fairly well, mostly because of the really solid worldbuilding that holds up really well and that enough time is spent making the main characters to be somewhat interesting. It also does draw on other cultures and in not just centred on Western cultures which, sadly, wasn’t done back in the 1960s. This has changed greatly now, for which I am super glad about with way more BIPOC authors being published, which is fantastic. I would imagine that in the Western world at least, this would have been revolutionary.So overall, I thought that this was good, but I suppose it failed to blow me away. I respect it for what it has achieved and how much of an influence it has had on the sci-fi genre, but respect does not always equal enjoyment or love for something. 7/10"

I personally didn't enjoy it very much though. It felt like it took me at least 300 pages to really get into the story. The book felt very long and I felt like I had to keep redirecting my attention back to reading because I wasn't feeling engaged. Part of it might be because it took me a while to get used to the new words being thrown around and at first I had trouble keep track of the characters. Also the way the Fremen were clearly inspired by Bedouins and Islam just kept distracting me. I did start enjoying it much more once I got halfway through it, probably because the action felt like it picked up. I don't think I'll be reading the other books in the series though."

Nemoguće je govoriti o broju dela koja su inspirisana opusom Frenka Herberta, nezamisliv je njegov uticaj na filmsku industriju, a pop kultura kakvu danas znamo ne bi bila ista da Džordž Lukas nije pročitao Dinu. Istina, knjiga je puna klišea, ali to je feler nas čitalaca, koji smo pre nje čitali sijaset ostvarenja iz žanra naučne fantastike nedvosmileno pod njenim impaktom. Jer danas što je kliše, onomad je bila autentičnost, koju su prepoznali i čitaoci i kritičari (Hugo i Nebula nagrade), te je to još jedan dokaz o uticaju koja je ona imala na sf literaturu posle njenog objaljivanja. Zamerka je da likovi nisu vraški dopadljivi kako u pripadajućem žanru umeju da budu, uključujući i samog Pola, osim par izuzetaka poput Gurni Haleka i Stilgara, što je u velikoj meri utisak posledično nastao zbog samog manira pripovedanja. Ali da nije Herbertovog odvažnog pristupa pisanju, ludačke ambicioznosti i neupitne inteligencije, ne bi bilo ove kosmičke epopeje koja ne samo da je ostavila traga, već je i oblikovala književni pravac kome pripada. 4/5"

Frank Herbert built up an incredibly vivid world, layer upon layer, with multiple religious/belief systems, strongly developed cultures which clashed with each other and a thousand currents of political manoeuvring, from the lowest classes up to the emperor himself. It took a very long time for this novel to reach any action, but I didn’t mind one bit, because I enjoyed really getting to know each character and exploring their universe. I found there wasn’t a single character I wasn’t invested in, or at least interested in. Paul, Jessica and Alia were particularly my favourites, especially with their Bene Gesserit insights/training. I must say, I really, thoroughly enjoyed the clever use of the giant desert worms in this novel. My only disappointment was the ending, not the way it ended, but the way it was told. I felt it was too rushed, there was too much telling and not enough showing, and the scene unfolding cut off before completion. I would have liked to see all the threads neatly tied up, but I guess these will be picked up in the next book."

Mikey Fernández organizó una lectura conjunta para estos días y aproveché la ocasión, aunque esta vez no he participado mucho en el Discord comentando el libro porque algunos días quedé rezagada con el calendario propuesto. Sin embargo, la última parte del libro la devoré y lo terminé antes de tiempo.Los primeros tres capítulos me resultaron un poco abrumadores, con mucha información y conceptos, y me asusté un poco, pero a partir de ahí va todo rodado. Me dejé llevar y me familiaricé pronto con la ambientación, la historia y los personajes. No me ha parecido para nada un libro complejo ni lento, de hecho es muy entretenido y las páginas vuelan, aunque van quedando cosillas en el aire que piensas que se resolverán más tarde pero no es así. ¿Ya tenía en mente Frank Herbert hacer una saga cuando escribió este libro? No lo sé. Está llenito de conspiraciones políticas y esos momentos los disfruté mucho. También tiene mucha importancia la filosofía, el ecologismo (aquí se nota lo fan que Herbert era de H.G. Wells), la religión (de hecho la figura del protagonista me ha parecido similar a la de Mahoma), y se percibe claramente la inspiración en algunas tribus originarias de Próximo Oriente para crear a la población de Arrakis, el planeta donde transcurre el libro. También se plasman costumbres medievales y es evidente, en general, el gran legado que “Dune” dejó a la fantasía y la ciencia ficción; he visto muchos recursos que han sido utilizados por otros autores posteriormente, como por ejemplo George R.R. Martin.Sin duda una de las cosas que más he disfrutado ha sido la construcción de mundo; la ambientación también, me atrapó por completo. “Dune” tiene momentos muy potentes y épicos, algunos un tanto psicodélicos (que se note que el libro fue escrito en los 60). También me ha gustado y me ha sorprendido la cantidad de personajes femeninos interesantes que hay, teniendo en cuenta la época en la que se escribió. Sin duda, Jessica o Alia han sido de mis personajes favoritos del libro; una pena sin embargo Chani, que prometía mucho y queda completamente desdibujada. El villano, el barón Vladimir Harkonnen, también me ha gustado mucho, disfruté sus conspiraciones y su patetismo con fervor. Los apéndices que se incluyen son muy interesantes, aportan datos muy esclarecedores sobre diversas cuestiones, tanto relativas a la trama como a Arrakis. En el punto negativo, el final me dio la sensación de que se precipitaba un poco y no me habría importado que tuviera más páginas, porque algunas soluciones me parecieron bruscas y apañadas en último momento. Me ocurre igual con algunos saltos temporales, algunos me gustaron, pero en otros habría sido genial ver algo más de desarrollo. A veces me daba la impresión de que el autor tenía prisa o pereza para esmerarse en ciertas cosas.El desenlace es casi ambiguo, abierto y al mismo tiempo no; se puede considerar la historia cerrada en cierto modo, pero para los muy curiosos (como yo) continuar con la saga es una necesidad obvia, porque en “Dune” se dan respuestas, pero también quedan muchos interrogantes.

142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40481325-bernardo,Rating 5 out of 5,"A few weeks ago when I was trying to decide which book I should read next and starring at my book shelf I set my eyes upon a thick book, with a dark cover. The title read “DUNE” and above that was written “Science Fiction’s Supreme Masterpiece”. Dune had been on my shelf for, I don’t know, maybe five or six years and I had always lacked the motivation to actually read it whenever I thought of its length. But this time something called my attention, I don’t know exactly what, maybe it was the golden colour of the sand drawn on the cover or maybe it was the crease on the tip of the cover.I opened the book and began to read the first page. There was a long quote from the “Manual of Muad’Dib” on the first half of the page, apparently written “by the Princess Irulan”, and there were words I didn’t recognise, like Bene Gesserit, Muad’Dib, Caladan and Arrakis. I kept on reading. A few pages later, as time flew by, I was still reading and turning the pages. And suddenly I reached the end of the first chapter. I just wanted to keep on reading and I was suddenly completely drawn into this book which I had avoided for so long. In the first Chapter I had only met Paul Atreides, Jessica and the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. There was also a mysterious test that Paul was going to face, which involved an object named “gom jabbar”. In the following chapters I met the Duke Leto Atreides, Paul’s father, and some members from his household, including Gurney Halleck, Duncan Idaho, Dr. Yueh and the “Mentat” Thufir Hawat. I learned that the Atreides family was in a dynastic feud with the Harkonnens and the plot was full of intrigue, betrayal and deception. The members of the Atreides faction were worried and concerned about moving from their home planet of Caladan to the desert planet of Arrakis, also known as Dune, where water might be the most valuable possession one could have, even more so than gold, where there are sandworms and also spice - “the crop for which Arrakis in the unique source”. After years of delaying the day I would read Dune, I just couldn’t put it down, even after what some might consider to be a somewhat slow start to the story, which gets deeper as the plot advances and we learn more about Dune’s cultural, religious, political, sociological and ecological landscape. In fact, there are far too many terms in Dune which are unfamiliar to the reader at first, but I later discovered that Dune’s complexity, as well as its length, lead to its depth and I found myself becoming emotionally attached to characters which felt genuine.I could go on to mention all the historical, cultural and religious themes which influenced Frank Herbert’s writing. I could mention how much some parts of the plot reminded me of Arabic culture and traditions. Or how surprising it was to see ecology being heavily featured in a science fiction book. But I will just say that I’m glad I opened Dune after all this years and read it. Dune is a truly epic story and a classic of science fiction."

While making my way through this story, it was all I wanted to do in life.I listened to the audio, but also picked up a hardcopy book at the library to check names, spellings, and read the appendices in the back of the book. The glossary in this edition was very helpful in keeping all of the mythology and worldbuilding straight. ..ETA on 2nd reading (9/5/2020): Still struck with the overall story. I understood a lot more this time around - no doubt since I've continued reading the series since initial reading in 2018. Looking forward to Villaneuve's film even moreso now. I was able to picture many of the actors as the characters while re-reading."

Sana yine de eleştiriler hazırladım :) Çünkü hatasız kul olmaz.Bu eseri övmek için söyleyebileceğim sayfalarca şey var ve bunların hepsi zaten söylenmiş. O nedenle kitabı okuduğum süre boyunca kalbimi sökercesine fetheden üç şeyden bahsedip eleştirilerime geçmek istiyorum.1. Kitabı okumaya başlamadan önce her defasında bol bol su içip hazırlanmama neden oldu. Ve bu hiçbir işe yaramadı. Frank Herbest çöl gezegenini öyle bir anlatıyor ki, kitabın başına oturduğum her seferde birden kendimi susuzlukla baş ederken buldum. Lavaboya gitmeyi erteledim, ne oluyorsa artık. Vücudumdaki suyu olabildiğince tutmaya çalıştığım bir Fremen taklidine dönüştüm.Kitaba dair en unutulmaz şeylerden biri kesinlikle suyun değerinin okuma seyrim boyunca aldığı şekildi. İnanılmaz bir anlatım.2. Orta Doğu kültürünü tarafsız bir Amerikalı'dan okumaktan dolayı mutluyum. İslamofobinin Herbert'ın zihninde egemen olmaması, onun tarafsız bakış açısıyla bu kadar başarılı ele alışında büyük bir katkı. Eğer yazar bir Orta Doğulu olsaydı benim için iki tehlike baş göstercekti: Yazar, çok sıkıntılı bulduğum bazı konuları güzelleyerek beni itebilirdi. Ya da yazar, kendi kültürüne duyduğu nefretle itici bir hava sergileyebilirdi. Ama elimizde hepsinden iyisi var: Dışarıdan bakan, tarafsız, üstelik efsanevi bir yazar.3. O nasıl bir kültür inşası, o nasıl sosyolojik dengeler bütünü? Bene Gesseritler'in her bir şeyine aşık olmuş olabilirim. Burada söylenecek çok fazla şey var ve bunları zaten çok yerde okudunuz. Çok kıskandım, son olarak onu söyleyeyim.Ama işte, birkaç şey var ki bu şaheserde gözümü fena tırmalıyor.Bunlardan ilki ve en büyüğü kesinlikle karakterlerin işlenişi. Frank Herbert'ın dünya/dünyalar yaratmadaki dehasını tartışmak ne haddime, ama kendisinin aynı başarısını karakter yaratmada göremedim. Kitabın karakterlerine hızlıca bakalım. Kötü adamımız Baron Harkonnen. Obez, sürekli bir şeyler tıkıştıran, üstelik genç erkeklere tecavüz eden sapkın bir kötü. Yahu bu bildiğin kötü şişman çocuk tiplemesi. Sonra Dük Leto. Leto, her iyi ve onurlu adam gibi bir şahini andıran yüz hatlarına sahip. Onurlu, gururlu, halkı her şeyden önce geliyor. Kalbi altın gibi ışıldıyor. Oğlunun önünde müthiş bir rol model. İyi de bu adamalr gittikleri gezegenleri sömüren insanlar günün sonunda. Atreides hanesi de büyük bir hanedan. Gerçekten bu adamlar böylesine halkın adamı mı? Tipik bir iyi/kahraman baba. Hem de yüz hatlarına kadar.Şu an ikinci kitaptayım ve sevdiğim bir karakter yok. Karakterlere sevgi duyamıyor, onlardan nefret edemiyorum. Harkonnenlar mesela, ""eeh"" diyerek okuyup geçtiğim bölümlere sahipler. Öfke duymadım, nefret etmedim. Herbert'ın karakterleri, (beni linç etmeyin!) bence karakterden çok tipleme seviyesinde kalıyor. Hele ki kitabın en başlarında.Paul'un ettiği sözlerde annesinin hemen gurur duyması, babasının hemen oğluyla ilgili hayallere dalması... Paul'ü gereksiz yücelten şeyler vardı kitapta. Neyse ki çölün derinlerine düşünce durumlar değişti.Fremenler ne zaman ki kitapta ağırlık kazanıyor, o zaman bu karakter sorunları da indirgeniyor. Derinlik başlıyor ve bunda kültürün büyük bir katkısı var. Fremenler sonrası her şey çok daha güzel ve kusursuz.-- Sevgili Onur Uslu'nun yorumu üzerine buraya da eklemek istediğim bir detay var --Dune'un özünde aynı karakterlerle bir seriyi götürmeyen bir yapıda olduğunu da göz önünde bulundurarak karakter eleştirisini yaptığımı belirtmem gerek. Burası gerçekten önemli. Bunu yaparken kafamda benzer yapıda olan (hatta her kitapta başka karakterleri işleyen) Vakıf serisi ile kıyas yaptım.Vakıf doğası gereği her kitapta başka karakterlere ev sahipliği yapar, ama her kitapta da o karakterleri bir şeklde özümseriz. Elbette tek kitaplık karakterler olmaları dolayısıyla herhangi bir roman dizisinde beklenen derinliğe ulaşmayız, ancak ben Vakıf'ın karakterlerine ""tipleme"" diyemem mesela. Ama Baron Harkonnen benim için maalesef sadece bir tipleme.Frank Herbert bize özellikle Baron Harkonnen'ı şöyle sunuyor: ""Bakın bu adam obez, süspansörler yardımıyla ancak yürüyor, üstelik genç erkeklere yürüyor, hatta onlara tecavüz dahi ediyor. Şimdi bu adamdan nefret etmenizi istiyorum.""Paul'ün bulunduğu konumu ve hikayede işlendiği süreyi de ele alarak (evet, vadesini biliyorum :) ) bir Vakıf karşılaştırması daha yapacağım.Vakıf'ın kurucusu Hari Seldon'ı da biz 2 kitapta görürüz mesela (Vakıf Kurulurken ve Vakıf İleri). Ama bugün Hari Seldon dediğimizde aklımda bir karakter uyanır. Paul bir karakter değil mi? Paul çok şükür o üstün evlat tiplemesinden çöle düşünce çıktı. Paul'ün gelgitleri onu karakter yaptı. Paul'ün iç çekişmeleri, kadere razı oluşu, Chani'ye karşı zayıflığı onu karakter yaptı.----Kitaba dair bir başka eleştirim diyaloglar üzerine. Kitabın ortalarına kadar bazı diyaloglar çok basit kaçıyor. O konumdaki biri gerçekten böyle bir laf eder mi?, dediğim anlar oldu. Bunları ilk kitap olmasına veriyorum. Yarısından sonra durumlar bir hayli toparladı yine. Mutluyum.Son eleştirimse yazarın milyon kez söylediği şeyleri tekrarlamasına dair. Bakın bu diyeceğimi yazar 2. kitapta da yapıyor ve sanırım diğer kitaplarda da yapacak.Mesela ortamda imalı bir laf ediliyor ya da Paul veya Jessica birinin gerçek ruh halini anlıyor. Yazar hemen 1 cümle boyunca bunun Bene Gesserit eğitiminden kaynaklandığını anlatıyor.Frank Başkan, bir dur Allah'ını seversen, zaten ortalık karışık. Sen ilk kitapta 700 sayfa bunu gözümüze soktun, ikinci kitapta neden hala yapıyorsun? Hatta ikinciye de gelme, ilk kitapta biz anladık, öğrendik bunları. Ne olur artık sürekli bunu açıklama, yalvarıyorum :( Hele ki Paul için bunu açıklaması daha da feci. Paul ki ... İşte biliyorsunuz, spoiler yazmayayım :) Paul gibi birini için açıklama yapması bence ayrıca gereksiz.Ama mesela aynı yazar bu bariz şeyleri açıklarken, başka şeylerde çok kapalı olabiliyor.Ayrıca, ilk kitap öyle bir bitiyor ki sanki kitapta eksik sayfa var. Hawat sahnesi mesela, büyük hayal kırıklığı oldu benim için. Çıta çok yükselmişti, karşılığını alamadık.Kitabın son bölümü uçarak gidiyor ve en olmaması gereken bölüm belki de. Küt diye de bitiyor kitap. Hadi son eleştirim de çeviri ve editörlüğe gelsin.İthaki'nin Bilimkurgu Klasikleri dizisinin ilk eseri olarak seçilmiş Dune'un daha az yazm hatasıyla karşıma çıkmasını iterdim. İkinci kitapta da bu durum devam ediyor, onu da eklemiş olayım. Onun dışında çeviriyle ya da editörlükle ilgili hiçbir sorunum yok. Ellere sağlık.Dune, okuduğum hiçbir şeye benzemiyor ve bundan inanılmaz mutluyum. 65'te yazılmış ama bugün bile bu kadar orijinal kalması hayret verici. Şaheser, evet, başka şekilde tanımlayamıyorum.Bu kitabın bir kokusu, bir dokusu ve bir sesi var. Görüyorsunuz, tadıyorsunuz, susuyorsunuz, dokunuyorsunuz... Uzaklardan kumsolucanlarının sesi geliyor. Buram buram baharat kokuyor üstelik. Beş duyuyla algılanabilen bir eserde bahsediyoruz.Ben sevdim, eller alsın."
146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2863914-joel,Rating 4 out of 5,"DBR to follow, at Ceridwen's request. She must have used one of her Bene Gesserit tricks on me.***Dune. Dune is a fascinating book. A classic of science-fiction, it plays equally as fantasy and allegory. It is deeply textured, richly layered. And if you want to read a sensible review of it, I'd go read, say, Cedriwen's. This one is going to be full of silliness.Arrakis. The desert planet. Home to spice and sandworms. Dune. You know, I went to the desert once. The Sahara Desert. It looked like this (ps I took this picture!):

I don't feel like tracking down a picture from the movie, so you have to imagine what Arrakis looks like. It looks a lot like the Sahara.So anyway, one of the ""things to do"" when you're in Morocco is to drive out into the Sahara and go for a camel ride, stay overnight in a Berber tent. Ah, camels. I don't know if any of you have ridden a camel (but I'm sure if you have, you will back me up on this): not as much fun as you would think. Riding a horse is, let's face it, always a little uncomfortable. You have to straddle it (twss!), you have to keep your legs at a weird angle (twss!), it starts to hurt after a while (uh... twss?). Riding a camel, on the other hand, sucks. Camels do not wear saddles. They wear blankets. A camel's hump is not very squishy for something that is supposed to be full of water, if my elementary school understanding of why they can live in the desert is accurate. If kind of feels like you are sitting on a rock, and it feels like someone is repeatedly hitting your public bone with a baseball bat. This is not just a guy thing; my girlfriend confirmed that after about five minutes, riding a camel ceases being at all fun and becomes an exercise in pain management. It hurt like hell while it was happening, and it was hard to walk the next day (omg, twss!).On Dune, the desert-inhabiting Fremen don't ride camels. They ride these:Scary. But probably not more uncomfortable to ride than a camel.Look, this is me with Fergie. I am smiling because I am no longer riding it.

Other than the sand and stuff, Arrakis is pretty different from Western Africa. Like the sandworms, which attack anyone who dares venture into the desert, there are the Fremen, a mysterious tribe of fighters who have a strange relationship with what they call ""the Markers,"" there is this stuff called spice that must be carefully harvested from the sands, the risk rewarded by the incredible worth of the spice as a drug used by the Guild to gives the navigators the prescient sight they need to chart courses through hyperspace, and by the Bene Gesserit witches, why use it to preserve their ways from generation to generation. Also I don't think Dune had package tours.Dune is a famously boring and complicated book. You may have heard that it has a lengthy appendix, and that when David Lynch turned it into a movie, the story was so complex that audiences had to be given cheat sheets along with their tickets. (Don't blame Frank Herbert for that, though. The Dune movie is just marvelously bad, as this chart will illustrate:

)Don't let its reputation fool you. Sure, Dune is a little bit boring in parts (the characters like to philosophize redundantly and have prophetic visions). But it is also an awesome space opera, with an entirely transporting sense of place and vidiv world-building. The political struggles that drive the plot engine are fiendishly complex to the occasional point of obtusion (I can't believe that is a word), but also a lot of fun to read about, thanks to sneering villains like Baron Harkonnen, who isn't just any old bad guy, but a grossly obese, slithery, murdering, rapist pedophile. The Fremen, a tribe of deeply spiritual religious fanatics who control a natural resource and are willing to die for what they believe... in. Hmmmm. And then there are the sandworms. I loved everything about this concept, from Herbert's vivid descriptions, to their presence as an omnipresent threat throughout the book, to their epic inclusion in the explosion and violence-heavy climax. Awesome.I haven't really said anything about the book. It's good. It's Dune. It is a super-famous classic for a reason. It has compelling characters (Lady Jessica is one of the most interesting female protagonists in classic sci-fi, and the book's take on gender politics, with an elite group of women are a powerful, secretive and controlling force in the galaxy , is worth examining.) It is epic in scope. It's nearly as deep as Tolkien (there's that appendix).It's also just cool."

152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1959589-jonathan,Rating 1 out of 5,"Man oh man, this was just not for me. The dialogue is insanely clunky and stilted. The linear world building, it doesn't feel like a world being given to you to explore but rather a railroad track tour of the world. Woe to the reader if you want to get off the track. I've seen people come to the defense of this saying well it was written in the 60's in terms of dialogue, info dumps, monologues, and strange terms that aren't well explained. That's not really an excuse, in my opinion. The large issue is that it seems to not have aged well, at all. It's been well surpassed writing wise. The near constant recaps of the previous chapters are largely unnecessary and just serve to annoy rather than help. The ending...was never really in doubt telegraphed from about 3 miles away with our near perfect great white hope savior. It was just more of a relief for me to finish it than be happy about it.That said, I can see where/why this novel is the Grandaddy so to speak of the science fiction world. I just think it's time to stop measuring anything newer against it, politely nodding as Grandad rants and raves while we help him walk to his bed and put him to rest. I'm glad I read it in the sense that one is glad they try a new food and learn they don't like it so at least they can say they have the experience of doing so and their opinion is grounded in experience."

156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1421407-janet,Rating 5 out of 5,"It's been years since I've read straight up science fiction or fantasy, and this was a wonderful mixture of the two. It was an internally consistent world vividly portrayed, Herbert has a touch of the poetic in describing his desert planet Arrakis, which I appreciated. I listened to it in an audio version that used actors to play the various roles, which at first I found irritating but later settled into and enjoyed immensely. Dune traces the coming of age of a new King--Paul Atreides-- as the House Atreides is moved from the wet planet Callisto to the desert planet--and we move from a vaguely Greek (House of Atreides) flavor of myth to one with vaguely Arabic overtones on the desert planet. Women surprisingly feature largely in the book--especially those belonging to the secret all-female Bene Gesserrit order, women imbued with great powers and knowledge, to which Paul's mother belongs. It's a basic hero plot but well done, with rival baddie house House Harkonnen, and lots of interesting devices and orders of character. The era's fascination with psychedelic drugs is well-captured by the treasure of Arrakis--Spice, which the competing planetary Houses and the space transport Guild rely upon.  A real Ace/Tor old school sci fi fantasy. I'd gone through an intense period of sci fi and fantasy reading earlier in my life-- lots of Zelazny, Philip K. Dick , Ursula K. LeGuin and Philip Jose Farmer-- but had not tried Dune until the film tickled my interest. As a writer, it was fascinating to see the things Herbert does exceptionally well. He handles a constantly-shifting omniscient point of view wonderfully well--something you'd never see in a Dick novel--so that all the cards are always on the table, and each scene shimmers with the varying points of view. He's also masterful in building suspense, packing the buildup to each major scene action with detail, much the way Poe did. I enjoyed it tremendously while I was reading it. Five stars for pure escapist entertainment."

От една страна горе-долу почти половината от книгата не успя да ми хареса, от друга пък след средата нататък историята започна по малко да ми приковава вниманието и интереса.Първата част тук ми беше крайно безинтересна. Почти всичко през цялото време беше много приказки – малко действие. Имаше едно доста дълго и бавно въвеждане в света, което ми подейства отегчително. През втората част нещата започнаха да се раздвижват бавно, като най-много ми допаднаха моментите с Пол и Джесика, докато „странстват“ през пустинята.Третата част беше и най-интересна и наситена откъм действие.Финалът не ми допадна особено. Намирам го за твърде суховат и прекалено политически обоснован.Но като цяло книгата следва добре познатата концепция – предопределен от съдбата главен герой с мисия, политически заговори и машинации, зъл родственик, падение-отмъщение-възмездие.Авторът предлага и доста интересни идеи, които изникват тук-там в творбата. Навярно за времето си книгата е била нещо огромно и новаторско за жанра фантастика. Иначе съм съгласен с твърденията, че оттук вдъхновение са почерпили много други творби – включително Star Wars и GoT. Сходствата направо са мега очевидни 😁
Цитат от книгата:
 „Когато религията и политиката се возят в една и съща колесница, конниците смятат, че нищо не може да им се изпречи на пътя. Те започват да препускат стремглаво — все по-бързо и по-бързо, и по-бързо. От главата им изхвръква всякаква мисъл за препятствия и забравят, че когато човек препуска слепешком, той съзира пропас��та едва когато е вече твърде късно.“ P.S. Гледах и филма – и не ме впечатли с нищо. Книгата е по-добре изпълнена."

I might have fallen in love with Gurney Halleck.
I’m not typically a fantasy or sci-fi fan, but this one really drew me in. The story is extremely compelling, the type you don’t want to quit reading, even if it’s long past midnight.The characters are genuinely interesting—I quickly developed a soft spot for Jessica and Halleck. This is one of the most important parts of a story for me.The only downfall of this book was its rushed and disappointing ending. Other than that, I’m in love with it.My Blog | My Books | Podcast | Instagram"

It is my third reading of Dune but from the previous ones many years ago. I did not remember how complete this novel is, as a great adventure, as its own worldbuilding and philosophy, as space opera galactic empire and of course as a sense of wonder: the desert, the worms, the greatness they evoke. Definitely a great classic that has not become outdated since it was published in 1965.PS: I do not intend to read the sequels, many people tell me that it is not worth it. Apparently for die-hard fans only. So now we have to wait for the Denis Villeneuve's movie."

The first time I read Dune, it was a Bildungsroman turning a boy into a super-hero, a savior of his adopted folk, and an extremely exciting story. I was fourteen years old, there were no ever-present distractions by smart phones, and I had no device to play video games on. Those were the 1980s, and I wanted to be Paul Atreides, and Iron Maiden's To Tame a Land ran continuously.This first read started a life long journey with an on-off relationship to this novel. There've been several years in between where I didn't touch it, and other times when I read it two times in a row. Let's just assume it has been ten times that I've read it. Now, you should know that I don't re-read books. There are rare exceptions, but I quickly get bored with re-reading. This book is different, because each time I find something different in it. A different aspect, or something which touches me in the relevant phase of my life. And boy, the book is so readable in layers within layers within layers, that it keeps unfolding fascinating topics that I didn't care for previously. There were times in the 90s, when I was fascinated by Dune's ecological discussion which I connected to our own sorry state of global warming and rising Sea levels. In the late 1980s there was my religious struggle with Catholic church, and my quest through Buddhism, Zen, and comparisons to Islam. That re-read vibrated with Dune's Orange-Catholic universal Bible and the sarcastic Bene Genesserit abuse of religious indoctrination, but also the following idiocies of religious fanaticism. I'm happy to say that I've found my peace in my belief again, though it's an ever struggle.


   
    Litany against fear
   
  I must not fear.Fear is the mind-killer.Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.I will face my fear.I will permit it to pass over me and through me.And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.Only I will remain.
 In the 90s, I also was heavily invested in everything Japanese, I just loved the Samurai, adored Myamoto Musashi, and trained in Aikido for several years. Dune's Prana-bindu training, the weird way, reflects the mysticism of some of those fighting skills perfectly, because not everything in live is science or religion. Another re-read followed my interests in Native uprises, most prominent the very long and very fascinating film Lawrence of Arabia which the Fremen story is based on. It also fit to the 9/11 terrorism and the reaction to it.Re-reading Dune has never been a comfort read like so many other of my friends fall back into. It's always been an intellectural or emotional struggle, a challenge coming up. What was new this time? First of all, I didn't really plan to read it this year (last time was 2017), but pictures of the new film hyped me again. My daughter asked for a buddy read (or was it the other way round?), and there we go again. It's the first time that I didn't slam through it in two or three days but had a slow read, a chapter a day. With special emphasis on the epigraphs, which are often overlooked in a continuous read-through.This time, I discovered a gender topic - the strong, independent females - most prominent Lady Jessica Atreides as royal concubine, struggling mother, and fighting Bene Gesserit. But also Paul's love interest Chani who never let her proud fighting skills be shadowed by Paul. And there is weird Alia of the Knives who snitched away the Baron Harkonnen as an en passent strike, and thereby deconstructing the big antagonist. Now Mr heroe's journey Campbell, how do you take that blow?This time, I've been preempted by several LGBT+ novels - it is a new thing for me as a reader to understand and interpret those non-binary pronouns. Coming back to Dune, there is nothing lesbian, agender or non-binary in it at first glance. And one can very safely read it as non-LGBT+ and be very happy with it (as I've been more than 35 years long). Only this time, an idea came up that I want to share: 
“There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that place within himself where the taking force dwells, but it’s almost impossible for him to see into the giving force without changing into something other than man. For a woman, the situation is reversed.” 
The Kwisatz Haderach has to be male. But why is that necessary? When Paul induced himself into the mind-changing state caused by the Water of Life, and thus turned to be the Kwisatz Haderach, Frank Herbert could have taken a different outcome: My logical conclusion is that Paul should have turned agender or non-binary, because he sees both ways as giver and as taker, i.e. both male and female are open to him. In fact, he changed fundamentally that very moment, just not with the gender consequence. I don't blame Herbert for not applying this, as that topic was uncommon back in the 1960s (though there were some SF experimental stories with gender transformation). And in a contemporary novel I'd certainly expect it. So there, you have it: It was gender discussion, this time.So jump with me on a Sandworm and sing along ""Riders on the Worm"".

Dune stays with me and keeps on giving. Together with Le Guin's The Dispossessed, it is the only book on this blog with 6 stars, because it doesn't fit in quality and importance to the otherwise excellent 5 star books.A final word to the book edition those gorgeous pictures here in the review are taken from: That's the Dune Deluxe Edition, isbn 059309932X, published by Ace. The binding is very good, it's got that melange eye colored sprayed edge, no interior illustrations, but the cover is double sided, and there is this awesome glossy iridescending style. I'd say it is affordable in contrast to other far pricier editions. So, here is the blurb for this edition:- An iconic new cover- Stained edges and fully illustrated endpapers- A beautifully designed poster on the interior of the jacket- A redesigned world map of Dune- An updated Introduction by Brian Herbert

Sì, così mi chiameranno.”  Un libro cult della letteratura di fantascienza.Non facile nel suo impianto narrativo.L’esistenza immaginata da Herbert non si circoscrive ad un pianeta ma ad un Universo dove pianeti, dominati da Case di Nobili ostili tra loro, sono orchestrate da un supremo Imperatore.Scritto nel 1965 sorprende per la sua complessità che lo differenzia da molte opere dello stesso genere che all’epoca miravano a una fantascienza metafora della Guerra Fredda in atto.Herbert fa qualcosa di più: su una trama di perfidi intrighi di corte costruisce un mondo dove la Religione diventa un’arma velenosa e l’Ecologia un antidoto di sopravvivenza. Impossibile non riconoscere un’eco lungimirante:- Fino ad oggi gli uomini e le loro opere sono stati un flagello per i pianeti - disse ancora il padre, - La natura reagisce ai flagelli: li elimina o li assorbe per incorporarli nel suo sistema. Il falco abbassò la testa, distese le ali e le ripiegò. Trasferì la sua attenzione alla mano protesa. Kynes scoprì di non avere più la forza di scacciarlo.- Qui su Arrakis - proseguì il padre, - l'antico sistema storico di mutue estorsioni e saccheggi si è bloccato. Non puoi continuare a rubare per sempre senza preoccuparti di quelli che verranno dopo di te. Le particolarità fisiche di un pianeta incidono un segno profondo sulla sua storia economica e politica. Quel segno è davanti ai nostri occhi e ci chiarisce i nostri obiettivi.La guerra tra la dinastia di Atreides e quella degli Harkonnen ha come baricentro il pianeta di Arrakis: un luogo tanto ostile, nel suo paesaggio desertico percosso da tempeste di sabbia e infestato da giganteschi e mostruosi vermi, quanto prezioso. Su Arrakis, infatti cresce il Melange, ossia una spezia che dà assuefazione e conosciuta come fonte per i poteri di preveggenza. Fra le due casate in lotta c’è l’antico popolo indigeno dei Fremen...Complicato per la terminologia che costringe a consultare le utili appendici ma affascinante e coinvolgente.""Niente, su questo mondo, le aveva dato a tal punto il senso del valore supremo dell'acqua. Non i venditori di acqua, non le pelli disseccate dei nativi, non le tute distillanti o le ferree leggi della disciplina d'acqua. Qui era una sostanza ben più preziosa: la vita stessa che s'intrecciava di rituali e simbolismi.L'acqua.- Gli ho toccato le guance - disse qualcuno. - Ho sentito il dono.""."
164,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10165256-penny,Rating 5 out of 5,"Top 10 favourite book of all time! I'm having a good run of books from that point of view at the moment.Told in the voice of an omniscient narrator the plot unfolds with practised ease around the cast. I'm not used to this style of narration and found it to be very powerful. Knowing the private thoughts and reactions of relevant characters in certain scenes was often vastly more revealing than anything else could have been. The world building was simply brilliant. The universe with it's politics and intrigues grew naturally and elegantly as the book progressed. There were a number of fascinating details such as the outlawing of computers and training humans to be computer-like called Menats. I wonder how hard it would be to train us to be machine like in our thinking? There are other 'abilities' humans develop through training that I wonder about. Paul is one of my favourite characters ever written and I knew that was going to be true fairly early on.  His ""gift"" of seeing the future is fascinating and we get a proper taste of his ability near the end of this book. I was really pleased that the ""future"" seems open to change rather than everything being deeply set in fate or whatever. I'm all for some people having special roles, but I'm not a big fan of not being able to affect change even when you can see the consequences of your actions. I can see why this is hailed as a classic and would recommend it to anyone and everyone. Can't wait to get on with the rest of the series. One of my favourite quotes from the book:""There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmerty, elegance, and grace -- those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of untimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death."""

The Afterward by his son is a good source for personal information about Frank Herbert. Another on-line source I happened across if this article from Salon http://www.salon.com/2015/08/13/dune_...The series; comparison to TolkienDune and its five sequels Dune Messiah (1969), Children of Dune (1976), God Emperor of Dune (1981), Heretics of Dune (1984) and Chapterhouse Dune (1985) constitute the best selling SF series of all time. In the depth of its tale of human rule in the galaxy it has been compared to Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings saga. Like Tolkien, Herbert produced elements of a language used in the saga, containing enough special terms that he included a glossary in the book. These terms were derived by Herbert from many different earth languages. The Afterward in the edition I read lists Navajo, Latin, Chakobsa (of the Caucasus), the Nahuatl dialect of the Aztecs, Greek, Persian, East Indian, Russian, Turkish, Finnish, Old English – and last, but hardly least, since it stands out particularly, Arabic.  The Afterward is written by Herbert’s son Brian Herbert. If you have a choice of getting an edition with or without this Afterward, I strongly urge you to get the Afterward.Herbert included a map with the novel (like Tolkien’s map of Middle Earth) and four appendices, in which he added detail to the novel – The Ecology of Dune, The Religion of Dune, Report on Bene Gesserit Motives and Purposes, and The Almanak En-Ashraf (Selected excerpts of the Noble Houses).OverviewSet over 20,000 years in the future, at a time when humans have colonized (from Earth) most of the galaxy. The galaxy-wide governing Imperium is medieval in character, with an Emperor ruling over Great Houses. The novel takes place on the planet Arrakis, a remote location of unimaginable value to both the Emperor and the Great Houses - being the only known source in the galaxy for mélange. This is a spice which is used crucially by the Space Guild; to prolong life and protect against disease (by those able to obtain it); and (by the Bene Gesserit) to enhance their secret mental abilities.The main players in the novel 
Emperor
The Padishah Emperor, Shadam IV, rules the Imperium at the time of the novel. He is the 81st such ruler in his bloodline, the House Corrino. His fighting forces, the Sardaukar, are the most vicious and feared warriors in the galaxy.
Spacing Guild
The Spacing Guild is a powerful commercial entity having a monopoly on both interstellar travel and banking within the Imperium. Of special note are Guild Navigators, who (through a cultivated addiction to melange) have developed the ability to guide spacecraft from one star system to another through “folded space” at instantaneous speeds.
Atreides
House Atreides, in the person of Leto Atreides (the Red Duke), begins the novel ruling the planet Caladan. Leto is pressured by the Emperor to move his kingdom to Arrakis near the start of the novel, and take over the governance of that important planet. Leto is the father of Paul Atreides, the main character of the novel. Paul’s mother, a concubine of the Duke’s, is Lady Jessica – a Bene Gesserit who is the main female character.
Harkonnen
House Harkonnen is a house with blood relation to House Atreides, but at the time of the novel the two houses have become sworn enemies. House Harkonnen supplies most of the villains for the story, the chief being Baron Vladimir Putin Harkonnen.
Bene Gesserit
The Bene Gesserit are an ancient society of women, both well-known in the Imperium but also very secret regarding their mental abilities and ultimate purposes. Often referred to in the novel as “witches”, by characters who hate and fear them.
Fremen
The Fremen are the native, desert-dwelling population of Arrakis. They play a momentous role in Dune, and in the sequels.Not a history of man’s technologyHerbert was not interested in writing a novel exploring technological advances in the far future. This is one of the things which set his novel apart from most science fiction of the 1960s. Rather, he wished to tell a story about the development of human psychology, mental abilities, and religion, as man explored and colonized the galaxy. Herbert developed an interesting means of taking technology out of the story – the Butlerian Jihad. (Information about this is contained in the appendices, not much in the story itself.) The Butlerian Jihad was a war that mankind waged against “computers, thinking machines and conscious robots” approximately in the middle of the 20,000 years between our present and the time of Dune. Once man (with great difficulty) had won this war, which raged across the galaxy for a century, an edict was set forth which would thereafter govern man’s relation to technology (a Prime Directive, if you will): “Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.” Herbert was uncannily prescient in this. In the 21st century there is growing concern with the possible consequences of increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence.CriticismsSome readers have voiced concerns about gender issues in Dune. It does portray a galactic ruling society in which males are the dominant rulers of the Great Houses, and have both wives and concubines. Well, it is a story. The author is not espousing this model as the way a society should be set up. The Bene Gesserit society of women have awesome mental powers and clearly have engineered much of the very long range plot line of the backstory, which comes to fruition in the novel. It is also made explicitly clear in the novel that both Leto and his son Paul revere and love the “concubine” women that bear their sons, and hold the official wives they might marry as merely political unions (along the lines of betrothals between royalty in ages past here on Earth).So, even if you are repelled about male domination of females (which I am) I don't believe this novel will upset you.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Previous review: Nations and NationalismRandom review: Most Die YoungNext review: IberiaPrevious library review: The Reluctant FundamentalistNext library review: Children of Dune"

170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7416346-gerhard,Rating 4 out of 5,"“The Fremen have the word of Muad’Dib,” Paul said. “There will be flowing water here open to the sky and green oases rich with good things. But we have the spice to think of, too. Thus, there will always be desert on Arrakis…and fierce winds, and trials to toughen a man. We Fremen have a saying: ‘God created Arrakis to train the faithful.’ One cannot go against the word of God.”Rereading ‘Dune’ a couple of decades after I first encountered it as a teenager, I can still remember being swept up by its exoticism, mystery and action, a heady blend as addictive as the spice melange itself. But from the vantage point of 2021, an astonishing 56 years after its initial publication – and it is currently still an Amazon bestseller – it is clear that the very basis for the reputation, longevity and interpretation of ‘Dune’ is as mercurial as the shifting sands of Arrakis itself.In an article from The Guardian entitled ‘Dune, 50 years on: how a science fiction novel changed the world’ (3 July 2015), Hari Kunzru comments that: “Books read differently as the world reforms itself around them, and the Dune of 2015 has geopolitical echoes that it didn’t in 1965, before the oil crisis and 9/11.” Barely a decade later, and the world around us has irrevocably changed yet again. Kunzru elaborates:Every fantasy reflects the place and time that produced it. If The Lord of the Rings is about the rise of fascism and the trauma of the second world war, and Game of Thrones, with its cynical realpolitik and cast of precarious, entrepreneurial characters is a fairytale of neoliberalism, then Dune is the paradigmatic fantasy of the Age of Aquarius. Its concerns – environmental stress, human potential, altered states of consciousness and the developing countries’ revolution against imperialism – are blended together into an era-defining vision of personal and cosmic transformation.I think the problem with ‘Dune’ is that it has become hermetically sealed by its own success, removed from the constraints of time and genre. Kunzru rightfully points out that Herbert’s own influences at the time were the Barsoom series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the Lensman series by E.E. ‘Doc’ Smith and, of course, the Foundation saga by Isaac Asimov, itself the subject of a new big-budget Apple+ television adaptation. These were the SF writers I was familiar with, and which shaped my view of the genre at the same time as I engaged with Herbert’s work. In this context, ‘Dune’ was but another iteration of that genre, and not the iconic object of veneration it has become today:It has sold millions of copies, is perhaps the greatest novel in the science-fiction canon and Star Wars wouldn’t have existed without it. Frank Herbert’s Dune should endure as a politically relevant fantasy from the Age of Aquarius.In terms of ‘political relevance’, it is clear that Denis Villeneuve is taking the proverbial bull by the horns with his latest adaptation. The second trailer reveals that the story is framed by Chani, who has experienced first-hand the brutal colonial subjugation of the Harkonnens, and who cynically wonders if the incoming Atreides will simply be their next oppressors.This is in marked contrast to David Lynch using Princess Irulan to frame his 1984 adaptation, speaking with the hindsight of history, but still representing the ultimate expression of that colonialist mindset, as represented by her father the Emperor, the Landsraad, CHOAM, the Guild and, let us not forget, the Bene Gesserit itself.Perhaps an unintended consequence of the Villeneuve trailer’s focus on the Paul/Chani relationship, obviously due to the marketing department honing in on the combined fan base of Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya to generate buzz and success for the upcoming movie, is that it foregrounds the ‘white saviour’ theme that seems so troubling in ‘Dune’, especially in our time where issues of race and gender are so highly politicised and emotive.It is only troubling though if you have not read ‘Dune Messiah’, where Herbert effectively and quite devastatingly turns the previous book on its head, taking the ‘hero’ story of Paul in a rather unexpected direction … a direction that becomes ever stranger and more baroque by the time we reach ‘God Emperor of Dune’ and ‘Heretics of Dune’, my two favourite books in the entire sequence.What I found remarkable about this reread of ‘Dune’ (my third, I think) is how quick a read it is. The page counts among the various editions seem to vary as wildly as the reported length of Shai Hulud, ranging from 500 to 800. I think the former is more accurate. Anyway, the narrative races along at quite a furious clip. I must say it does slow down in the third section, ‘The Prophet’, which does feel like a lot of filler as we build up towards the climactic battle.Much has been said about how dire Herbert’s writing style is. Yes, most of the characters are cardboard cut-outs, with their thoughts and responses telegraphed in italicised speech that is the literary equivalent of speech bubbles in a graphic novel (speaking of which, ‘Dune’ now exists in that format as well, including a series of shorter comic books, if I’m not mistaken.)What do we really know of Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho, apart from the broadest of writerly brush strokes? Even Paul himself does not convince, starting out as a callow 15-year-old and ending up defeating the Padishah Emperor himself. The women fare no better, with Mohiam repeatedly referred to as a ‘crone’ or a ‘witch’, and a boilerplate reference to Chani’s ‘dark elfin features’, which is meant to alert the reader to her ‘native attractions’, I think.No, what makes ‘Dune’ really stand out is the exemplary world-building. What struck me rereading this is how conditioned we have become, via the David Lynch and SyFy Channel adaptations in particular, to think of it as, well, a barren desert planet, when in fact it is a fully-fledged ecology. Herbert’s nature writing and scene setting here are quite painterly, giving us an intimate glimpse of the fauna and flora of Arrakis (yes, there are even flowers and birds!)We now know, thanks to Kim Stanley Robinson and his Mars trilogy, that terraforming is not politically correct. But Herbert states quite clearly that the Fremen intuitively comprehend the intimate relationship between the desert, the worms and the spice. They only plan to terraform the more accessible parts, leaving the deep unchartered sands to Shai Hulud himself.What Herbert does so skilfully in ‘Dune’ is to craftily use his action set pieces as disguised info dumps. Think of scenes like Liet Kynes taking the Duke and Paul via ornithopter to see spice mining for the first time. We the reader see this incredible spectacle through the eyes of our protagonists, experiencing what they are seeing and feeling, while learning about the planet’s intricate and dangerous symbiotic sandworm lifeforms at the same time.Herbert similarly uses the Paul-versus-Jamis fight to educate the reader about Fremen rites and sociocultural practices, particularly as these relate to religion and death. Jamis’s burial is oddly elegiac and moving, a moment of great stillness and reflection in the wake of the desperate and lethal combat that preceded it. The Jamis fight is followed immediately by Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen celebrating his seventeenth birthday by dispatching his hundredth gladiator to an adoring crowd in an arena on Giedi Prime.We learn early on in the book that the Baron is actually Paul’s grandfather, but Herbert does not really do much with this. I wonder therefore if the Baron’s paedophelia-or-homosexuality (I don’t think it is really clear in which camp he falls), is but one end of a Kinsey Scale of a familial chain, with the depraved Harkonnens at one end and the rigidly moralistic Atreides at the other.I was surprised to read somewhere that Frank Herbert had a complex relationship with a gay son that went unresolved until the latter’s death from AIDS in 1993 (Brian Herbert briefly refers to his brother in ‘Dreamer of Dune’, his hagiography of his father.) However, I honestly don’t think one can read too much into this.At the end of the day, ‘Dune’ remains as gloriously inscrutable and probably as batshit crazy as it must have done to its original readership. Actually, kudos to David Lynch’s screenplay, which manages to wrestle the beast into somewhat of a malleable form, despite such Star Trek liberties as the ‘weirding modules’. And that closing shot of it raining on Arrakis.The Villeneuve trailers to date have used much of the Lynchian iconography, such as the framing device and Paul’s visions of Chani and the Fremen, not to mention the trip to Arrakis in the Guild’s heighliners, which is a mere throwaway line later in the book. Integral characters like Chani and Stilgar appear in person only much later, and Lynch quite cleverly used Paul’s visions as a kind of linking device to splice the narrative together.SOME THOUGHTS ON THE LATEST DUNE MOVIE ADAPTATIONWhen Villeneuve took on the project, he apparently stated he would only do so if he would be allowed to make two movies. That apocryphal story has since changed, with it being reported that no second movie has been greenlit, pending the success of the first one. As with ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Lord of the Rings’, one would have thought that Warner Bros. would have given Villeneuve the go-ahead to write, develop and shoot the movies back-to-back to save costs and ensure continuity. The recent IMAX unveiling of the first ten minutes of footage did, apparently, feature a title card clearly stating ‘DUNE: PART 1’.With a run time of 155 minutes, Villeneuve has also said that his movie only covers the ‘first half’ of the book. Current speculation as to the cut-off point is either Paul’s fight with Jamis or Jessica taking the Water of Life. The former seems more likely, although I do hope Villeneuve includes the elaborate funeral ceremony and subsequent insight into Fremen culture this allows. However, this probably does mean that Part 1 is likely to end on a rather subdued note if it goes full Jamis, so maybe the Water of Life is a better cliffhanger?What I suspect though – and there is an inkling of this in comments from some of the crew such as cinematographer Greig Fraser that Part 1 is entirely ‘self-contained’ – is that Villeneuve has done his own ‘take’ on ‘Dune’ that eschews many of the plot elements, action set pieces and even characters we are so familiar with. So come its release end October, we could be in for a rude awakening … (How much of a veil of secrecy is likely to be cast on its screening at the Venice Film Festival remains to be seen.)"

I went in the wrong direction due to a hugely long waitlist to check this book out. I watched the most recent movie and then read the book. Honestly, I thought the movie did a pretty good job. The main issue with this book is that it is SOOOOOO long. It should have been split in two. The third book section and beyond felt less developed and edited. There were a lot of newer concepts, and the relationships were extremely rushed. I wonder if Frank Herbert originally intended this to be a single novel and was trying to wrap up the ending. With that being said. This book is epic as F. You must read it. The beginning is very Sci-Fi heavy, but after they are established on the new planet, it reads more like an epic fantasy. The characters have immense development. And somehow, I still wanted more of the culture. Worth a read at least once in your life. 4-4.5 Stars. I will definitely continue on with the series."

Dune is, without doubt, a groundbreaking story with a complex and enthralling universe. The concept of Dune is exhilarating: sandworms, a messiah, the Fremen and their spice. The actual reading, however, is a slightly less perfect experience.Princess Irulan states from the beginning that precocious Paul is not only meant for greatness, he's already a Legend. So Dune is not much about Paul struggling to believe he's the One as it is about Paul in his heroic journey fighting his fate: the unstoppable Fremen jihad he so much wants to avoid. We can see him time after time refusing to be what his prescience has showed him. And on that note, there's a lot of Dune that you know from the beginning because foreshadowing is the key word. The funny thing is, Herbert keeps telling the story as if you haven't already been warned. Leto's death, Harkonen's attack, Paul as leader of the Fremen, Muad'Dib AND Kwisatz Haderach.When you talk about Dune, you have to admit the world-building is flawless but when it comes to character development, time-skip is its biggest enemy and mine: I'm a characters reader. And even if the characters were on spot most of the time, Herbert insisted on laying out their inner thoughts instead of actual dialogs which was incredibly annoying. There is little to no characterization maybe because Herbert indulges his interest in ecology, political philosophy, religion and the messianic quest more than anything else which, if I understand correctly, is perfectly okay for the genre. I didn't get to see the actual development of the characters and so there was a lot of guessing for me: about Fremen as a society, Paul and Chani's relationship, his son, and more. Herbert chooses to leave you in the dark most of the time and when answers come, they're scarce and unsatisfying. So you keep reading! It's a page turner, alright, but because you're in painful need to make sense of the story. And you kinda love it, honestly. Despite all this, I'm completely captivated by Herbert's creative world. I couldn't get enough of Paul's ability to see present, past and future as a now, the pseudo-technology, the Bene Gesserit and of course, the spice and its properties to name a few.All in all, it was a great book and I enjoyed a lot of it even if I fought with Herbert through the whole experience. I'm not sure if I'll keep up with the series, though, but I'm sure fans of the genre will absolutely love this. Mind-blowing art by Mark Molnar "
177,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44737540-pat-the-book-goblin,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read this book the first time last year and I absolutely loved it. I loved it so much I had to reread it again this year but this time I'm tackling the rest of the series too. My review of the book from last year is down below: This book was awesome!! Not only was the adventure amazing but the growth of the characters in this story is something every writer can learn from to make their own characters more real. The desert planet setting had a life of it's own. It was believable. Herbert's talent as a writer is undeniable. There is a reason Dune is one of the greatest epics of science fiction. Paul Atreides/Muad'Dib/Kwisatz Haderach is an amazing character. Originally groomed to be the Duke of Caladan by his father Leto, he and his family are sent away by the emperor to a desert planet called Arrakis, or Dune. Paul's life is overturned by treachery from those the family trusted most. On Dune Paul must learn to survive the harsh environment of this Tatooine-like planet and perhaps one day avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family. It surprises me how some of the greatest books are set in desert-like settings. In Star Wars the main body of the story is set on Tatooine, a desert planet. The Way of Kings is mostly set on the Shattered Plains where it is dry and arid (though not as devoid of water as Dune or Tatooine). The symbology of it is awesome. I also found it interesting how Herbert weaves so much symbology, anthropology, and moral lessons into this story. I felt like I was reading an ethnography of the Fremen peoples. By the end I knew who they were, what they ate, what their religion was, how they buried their dead, and so on. This book was richer because of Herbert's careful planning and research. I found it very cool how the people even save the water from their breath, and even from the dead, because in all deserts water is sacred. The ritual of how Paul got the name Muad'Dib, reminded me how in some cultures the giving of a name is just as important as one's birth. Muad'Dib means mouse. I liked that. Its interesting how different groups perceive things differently. We look at a mouse and think of a critter that gets into our house or carries disease, but in Fremen culture they are seen as ""wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.' That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul-Muad'Dib, who is Usul among us. We welcome you."" Its interesting to think that through the eyes of the Fremen they look at the mouse as wise and something they try to mimic. Its funny how people find wisdom. Probably why traveling the world and seeing the world through the eyes of others only adds to our life the those lives around us. In conclusion I would definitely recommend this book, not only because it was the first to win the Nebula Award, shared the Hugo Award, and undoubtedly set the stage for science fiction, but it is a story we can all relate to and it shows how nothing is more important than family."

Dune is a totally immersing reading experience ; the level of world building on show is truly incredible. An epic book that has a lot of space within the writing that leaves the imagination to do the work. For instance ; there are no big descriptions of set piece battles. The readers experience of them is all told second hand from the view point of those who were not necessarily directly involved. This should prove exciting from the new movies perspective as it looks like the director Denis Villneuve's has given his own imagination free reign in bringing Dune to the screen, while still staying faithful to the book.

190,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13703358-ms-smartarse,Rating 4 out of 5,"Dune is one of those classics that I've long been aware of, but never really felt like tackling. I remember bits and pieces from the 1984 movie, and I've definitely heard sci-fi lovers wax all poetic about the books. Yet with over 800 pages in the first book, setting time aside for it always felt like such a chore.Then I went to watch the 2021 movie, spent over 2 hours admiring Zendaya's soulful blue eyes, and fangirling over Jessica's creepy Bene Gesserit voice... only to realize at the end, that not much of the world made sense to me. So with frustration prevailing, I finally picked up the first book.The story is simple enough: 15-year-old heir to the House of Atreides, Paul, finds himself running for his life on the desert planet of Arrakis. With most of his family murdered, his mother in grieving mood more often than not, the young boy is forced to rely on his budding (and extremely confusing) prescient abilities to survive.The events are powered by a complex mix of politics and religion, with a liberal sprinkling of ecological theories. I loved the politics, especially the chapters describing the enemy tactics, and the ecological details painted a very interesting picture of the desert planet. The religious aspects however, were not to my taste. Admittedly, I do have some very deeply-rooted personal bias when it comes to this topic, so I may be looking at things more critically than others.Even so, with enough foreshadowing, I think I may have eventually warmed up to the whole prescient Messianic Child hype. Additionally, I had the bright idea to put the book on hold for a couple of weeks, in order to catch up with other books from my reading goal. And when I came back, I was never able to immerse myself in quite the same way.That said, I'd still attribute a big part of my disappointing experience to the story's sudden penchant for time skips: years, months, weeks you name it. The last 80 pages have them in spades. Though I did occasionally find the day by day approach tedious, the sudden shift in pacing was too jarring. And worst of all, the time skips didn't feel entirely justified. Or perhaps I felt the need for a few more bridging phrases, especially for that first 3-year time skip. You can't just put everything on fast-forward, set significant character development between scenes, and also expect the reader to get emotional during the final scenes.Score: 3.8/5 starsOn the whole, watching both the movie and reading the book was a good choice. The former shows a more human side of 15-year-old Paul, while the latter fills in the gaps from the world-building."

I had tried to read Dune twice before and could not get through it. The last time was many years ago. I might have been able to now, as an older adult, but I wanted to finish so I thought an audiobook with a full cast was the way to go. I'm glad I did it this way. I will fully acknowledge that Dune must have been WAY ahead of its time. Sort to like LOTR was for epic fantasy. And yeah, I would also call it a classic, a masterpiece, pick your favorite label. They would apply. The story is absolutely epic. I like the mix of tech and mysticism. The mind and creativity that came up with this is nothing short of astounding.

Yeah it does present some difficulties. At least it did for me and I could very much be off base on some of these points, so take all this with a grain of salt. It does have a lot of world building. I normally really, really like that. But here it was pretty dense. I don't know how else to put it. It also seemed to have large jumps in time (unless I'm missing something) where there was significant events that basically I had to try to infer. Like Paul having kids? One moment he's developing feelings for the Fremen woman, the next ""part"" of the book starts and he's got kids. Maybe I missed something in there. And then there seemed to be a jump where they were gearing up for a war on Arrakis, and then, again, a new ""Part"" starts and the war had been raging for some time. It just seemed odd to me to skip over that much that quickly. It also seemed odd to me that they have space travel, interstellar and an illusion box that can make it look like your hand is burning, but to me it sounded like most of the combat (other than nukes) was with knives. Interesting. And here's the one I'm probably most going to get rapped in the mouth for. I wasn't, candidly, all that crazy about Paul. I get that he's noble-born and all that and he's in conflict with a family that is trying to wipe him and his out. But even with his own guys, sometimes he came across as kind of haughty. But I honestly liked it enough to get the audio (if there is one) for the next book. Maybe someday I'll try re-reading a hard copy too. Seems to me this is one of those books that you would get more from each time you read it. Certainly is that way for me with LOTR."

Lo primero a resaltar de 
Dune
 es la narrativa. Y debo admitir que a mí me fascinó. El autor nos permite conocer el punto de vista de cada personaje en una misma escena, y lo logra de manera pulcra, sin generar confusión cuando se pasa de los pensamientos de uno a los de otro.En cuanto a la historia, 
Dune
 nos presenta la travesía de la familia Atreides en Arrakis, un planeta desértico al cual deben mudarse por orden del Emperador. La trama está cargada de muchos giros inesperados; siento que la primera parte funciona perfectamente como un introductorio a este nuevo mundo, nos presenta a los personajes y las peculiaridades del planeta; sin embargo, siento que la segunda parte es una montaña rusa de sucesos que pasan muy rápido y dejan cierta incertidumbre. Y, aunque todo parece un poco predecible, no lo es.El mundo que nos presenta Frank Herbert está muy bien creado, y tiene todos los elementos esenciales para convertirla en una gran obra de ciencia ficción, desde el protagonista Paul con sus increíbles poderes hasta los enigmáticos gusanos de arena y todo el sistema de gobierno. El atractivo principal de la historia lo encontré, como tal, en el planeta Dune (Arrakis), en su historia y su ecología. Aunque sí me gustaron ciertos personajes (como el Duque Leto y Paul), ninguno se me hizo muy memorable. Al final, este libro te deja queriendo leer inmediatamente el segundo.

Some science fiction books get to wrapped up in their own languages and cultures but dune had just enough of that to keep you involved without overdoing it. It helped that it had its own dictionary in the back if you got confused. I'd highly recommend this book. Action, adventure, space, family, and a mild love story. I'm very happy with this book and will be continuing onto the rest of the series."
195,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91988063-alberto-palomino,Rating 4 out of 5,"Pues bueno, aquí esta, la esperada reseña de esta obra clásica ya de culto en la ciencia ficción, y esperada por mi sobretodo porque lo empecé en Septiembre de 2020… Pero empecemos por el principio, como supongo que ya casi todos sabrán de que va la historia, no hace falta que ponga una sinopsis, pero hare un pequeño resumen a mi manera. Estamos en el futuro, el universo conocido esta partido por un gran número de casas feudales unidas a un gran organismo llamado el Landsraad. Una de esas grandes casas es la Casa de los Atreides, los cuales van a recibir del Emperador de la Humanidad (no, no el de Warhammer) el feudo de Arrakis, también conocido como Dune, con todos los privilegios que eso conlleva, como ser los encargados de la melange, una especia que solo nace en este planeta y que es muy codiciada en el universo. El problema es que la Casa de los Harkonnen, enemigos acérrimos de los Atreides, eran los que llevaban el cotarro con el negocio de la especia, y ahora deben abandonar el feudo para los nuevos propietarios. Pero los Harkonnen no van a dejar las cosas así como así y traman un arriesgado y complicado plan para quitarse de en medio a los Atreides sin provocar al Landsraad, lo que no saben es que hay mucho más en juego, y hay planes dentro de otros planes dentro de otros… Vamos, un Juego de Tronos en toda regla (no me podía resistir). Debo confesar que la primera mitad de libro se me hizo durito, de ahí que haya tardado tanto en leerlo, además de cosas propias sin justificación de este quien escribe la reseña. Sobretodo hay varios factores que hicieron que mi lectura sufriera un poco. Uno, saberse más o menos la historia de la primera mitad, esto es cosa mía pero más o menos conocía lo que pasaría hasta un punto en concreto de la historia y provoco esa lentitud. Y sabiendo que dentro de nada saldrá la famosa película de Denis Villeneuve y espero que Dune se convierta en una franquicia exitosa habrá gente que lea el libro luego de ver la película y puede que también les pase lo mismo. En mi opinión la parte de los Atreides en Arrakis afianzándose y preparando el terreno antes de que estalle todo se me hizo bastante pesado, y no será por la complejidad, puesto que mi parte favorita del libro son los entramados políticos, pero la narración algo espesa de Herbert no ayuda en el dinamismo. 

—Supongo que hoy no estoy de humor para esto —dijo Paul.—¿Humor? —Halleck no pudo evitar sonar indignado, incluso a través del filtro del escudo—. ¿Qué tiene que ver tu humor? Uno combate cuando es necesario… ¡no cuando está de humor! El humor está bien para los borregos, para hacer el amor o para tocar el baliset. No para combatir.—Lo siento, Gurney.—¡No lo sientes lo suficiente!

¿Pero entonces porque tiene un cuatro? Porque en un punto en concreto del libro, la historia hace un giro y ya me tenía enganchado hasta terminarlo. Quien se haya leído el libro sabrá más o menos del momento del que hablo, digamos que la historia pega un salto temporal y las cosas cambian mucho a como nos habían presentado. Ahí el libro me gano, y cuando pensaba que no subiría de las tres estrellas, me tuvo agarrado al asiento como quien dice. También mentiría si no dijera que el hecho de que la película se estrene más pronto que tarde en España ha ayudado a que me diera prisa con el librito para tenerlo terminado para cuando vaya al cine. Que Villeneuve es mucho Villeneuve, si no verse Blade Runner 2049. Dune es una obra difícil de clasificar. Ha influenciado a muchos autores y muchas historias no hubieran visto la luz sin la obra de Frank Herbert (como pueden ser Star Wars, Canción de Hielo y Fuego, etc). Es compleja, profunda, llena de simbolismos, mensajes ecológicos, religiosos, políticos. Sin duda ha envejecido muy bien, teniendo en cuenta que es de los años 60, y se lee como un libro de hoy en día (quitando como mencione lo áspero que me resulto su narración en la primera mitad). Fundación por ejemplo solo tiene diez años menos, y a mí se me atraganto, y lo que fui a buscar en esa obra de Asimov lo encontré en esta. Donde tenemos un Imperio en decadencia, facciones tan interesantes como las Bene Gesserit, la Cofradía Espacial, la CHOAM, todo el asunto de las casas feudales y esa especie de paz artificial creada para satisfacer el statu quo de los intereses de las potencias en juego, que Arrakis va a desestabilizar, quizás con resultados nefastos para todos.  

—Hubo un tiempo en que los hombres solo prestaban atención a las máquinas, con la esperanza de que ellas les hicieran libres. Pero esto solo permitió que otros hombres con máquinas los esclavizaran.—«No construirás una máquina a semejanza de la mente del hombre» —citó Paul.

No quiero ahondar mucho en el argumento en si porque es una experiencia que cada uno debe descubrir, pero obviamente ahondare un poco más en ciertas cosas que me han gustado y otras que no tanto. Los personajes por ejemplo, todos tienen su desarrollo, sus virtudes y son diferentes unos de otros y evolucionan. Paul Atreides como un joven prometedor que tiene en sus manos el destino de muchos, Leto Atreides, la Dama Jessica (personaje femenino fuerte e independiente ya en los sesenta), Thufir Hawat, Gurney Halleck y su Basilet. Eso en lo que respecta a los Atreides, luego tenemos a los Fremen, esos nómadas del desierto invencibles y que son la clave en el asunto. Stilgar sin duda seria el que más me ha gustado, porque realmente no hay muchos fremen con voz y voto. Y sin duda, una de mis favoritas y que sale menos de lo me gustaría, como es Santa Alia del Cuchillo, tengo ganas de leer los siguientes libros solo por este personaje. En cambio me hubiera gustado ver más sobre el punto de vista de los Harkonnen, las pocos capítulos que les tenemos de protagonistas me encantaron. Son los malos si, y ahí radica la gracia y también para haber tenido un coctel diferente de los Atreides. Ese gordo aberrante de Vladimir Harkonnen, frio, calculador, desquiciado y sin ninguna moralidad. La Bestia Rabban que solo aparece en un capitulo y sanseacabó (en la peli tiene pinta de que tendrá más importancia, al interpretarlo Dave Bautista). Y Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, un personaje muy interesante, quizás el punto más gris entre los Harkonnen, personaje que sí que creo que cumple muy bien su papel en la trama y no esta desaprovechado. Pero digamos que me quede con ganas de más de estos tipejos. Por ejemplo, Martin y sus Lannister, beben mucho de los Harkonnen como casa contrincante de los protagonistas, pero aquí el tito Martin sí creo que supera a Herbert, puesto que le da un protagonismo a los Lannister que incluso eclipsa al de los Stark (los “buenos”), al menos yo prefiero a los Lannister, son más divertidos y complejos. Aun así, entiendo que Herbert tampoco quería saturar la historia y supongo que lo que tenemos es más que suficiente. También hubiera molado ver más a los Sardaukar en acción, esa elite de guerreros temibles y sanguinarios del Emperador, pero como digo, son criticas menores. 

Vinimos de Caladan, un mundo paradisíaco para nuestra forma de vida. En Caladan no existía la necesidad de construir un paraíso físico o mental… lo teníamos a nuestro alrededor. Y el precio que pagamos era el precio que los hombres siempre han pagado por llegar al paraíso: nos acomodamos, perdimos nuestro temple.

En resumidas cuentas, Dune es una obra que pese a su inicio lento y farragoso, en cuanto te pilla, no te suelta. Con una gran construcción de mundo, que da la sensación sin duda de que no todo ha cabido en este libro, si no que en los siguientes sabremos mucho más de este gran universo y que en este primer libro solo hemos vislumbrado la mitad de él. Y que cuenta una historia que esta más de actualidad con nuestros tiempos que con los de Frank Herbert, quien lo diría, al final todo el tema de la Yihad y el análisis tan profundo sobre el fanatismo religioso puede a más de uno llamarle la atención. Aunque como digo, aquí encontraras de todo, aventuras, politiqueo, ecología, ciencia ficción, sentido de la maravilla, personajes grises, y una lucha entre dos casas enemigas que desembocara en un conflicto mucho mayor. Preparen los destiltrajes, pónganse correctamente bien la capucha y agarren fuerte sus crys, que nos vamos de acampada a las dunas de Arrakis, y si escucháis un siseo, y observáis a un gran gusano de las arenas, bueno, espero que sepáis volar."

197,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67743671-safeer,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a masterpiece of world building. Admittedly, this will not appeal to everyone.Does the world need another Dune review? I very much doubt it needs mine but that never stopped me before, saturation be damned!Dune. A single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well.The appeal of Dune is peculiar. In order to enjoy Dune you have to enjoy complexity. All authors create little worlds in their stories but Herbert created a world. He doesn't just say that Arrakis is a desert planet, he engrosses himself and the reader into the geology. We get a new planet, and while it's obvious that the author based his desert planet on real sights and cultures, it's still awesome. The Fremen and their culture, the stillsuits, the worms, the plight for water... It's all explained in such a vivid detail without being boring or repetitive. And while reading you can see the references! Can we talk about how many movies and books have been influenced by this?Is it space opera? Is it political commentary? Is it philosophical exploration? Is it fantasy? _Dune_ is all of these things and possibly more. One thing I do know: it's a kick-ass read! I highly recommend it to any and all. I must admit that there is the occasional infelicity in some of Herbert's prose (and a too-heavy reliance on inner monologues to either state the obvious or convey information to the reader), but overall I can forgive him this for having crafted such an excellent tale. Woven into the story of a tottering space empire are real questions about ecology, responsibility and human life that are well-worth thinking about. Politics is not just a veneer, but the lifeblood of this story and, to me at least, it makes it all the more exciting.All of these incredibly ambitious elements are all tightly woven together. Take out one element and the story loses its cohesion. Despite all the ridiculous amounts of detail there is nothing extraneous in this novel. Dune is a remarkable, magnificent accomplishment. But it's okay if it's not to your taste. "

This was my first re-read of the classic that I'm sure I'll visit with again a few times down the road. But I shouldn't have waited 20 years. This book is too good to go that long without reading again.How can I do it justice in a review? I can say, ""it's cool"", but that doesn't come close. Even a 5-star rating seems to be short of expressing its worth. This is one of those books that should be allowed a 6th star.I can't even pin down what it is exactly that makes this stand out. Sure, it's got great literary elements, likable and sympathetic heroes, wickedly delicious villains, awesome ""monsters"" in the sandworms, a science fiction technology system that makes sense. It has epic ""universe building"", a plausible ""magic"" system in the Bene Gesserit sisterhood. It has old style swordplay and futuristic intergalactic scope.I've always said it's a science fiction that reads like a fantasy. The technology is truly secondary. Once everyone gets to Arrakis, the fantastic elements take over. Herbert's prose is what makes the difference, I think. He tells an engaging story with an easy going clear language. His work is layered and has so much in it: philosophy, religion, science, morality, loyalty, cruelty, politics, espionage. It leaves the reader thinking long after closing the book. Reading Herbert makes me feel like I've learned something yet all the while I was being entertained."
199,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93434926-michael-theneverendingtbr,Rating 5 out of 5,"I don't know where to start with this book and explaining it to anyone, it's clearly a masterpiece. It was first published in 1965, it's just way ahead of it's time; nothing like I've read from the 60s before and nothing like I've ever read before in general.God knows how long it took the author to write this, you can definitely tell it's carefully written; it's just full of depth, details of the characters and surroundings.There's a lot of politics in this book, which doesn't interest me much and it does drag from time to time but it doesn't stop me one bit from giving it a top rating because like I said - it's just a masterpiece and the writing is genius.Personally I think to fully digest this book, it has to be read two or three times because it is the most complex book I've ever read; if you've read it you'll know exactly what I mean.I'm aware of the mixed reviews on the sequels, so I'm a little weary of continuing; what's your opinion on them?"

206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106776910-jesse,Rating 5 out of 5,"Since I got into reading (about 3 years now), this book always came up. Whether on YouTube or Goodreads. I always wanted to read it, but always thought, from what I saw other reviewers saying, that it is very hard to follow and quite confusing. So I dropped the idea.Then the Villenueve movie came out. It looked really good (and since this guy directed Blade Runner 2049, it was practically guaranteed to at least be a good story).I liked the movie. It gave a good sense of immorality, politics and identity. I found myself being a bit bored at times, I think for the reason that I was kind of confused. Like, where was the world building?I wasn't planning on reading this, at least until the next movie came out, but a fellow Goodreads friend told me you'll love the movie more if you read the book (thanks Allison). I saw it at a store, and listened to her advice.And oh brother, am I glad I did.Right off the bat, I knew this would at least be a three star read. The politics were interesting and the world was mysterious. Some said the start was confusing, which I totally get, though understood what was happening because I had already watched the movie. B even though I watched the film before hand, I still enjoyed it as if I never had. I'm actually glad I did, because I didn't feel lost like so many other readers seem to be.The movie starts exactly like the book, just dumping you into the world, no world building or nothing (though this certainly doesn't stay that way for long). Now that I think about it, there really wasn't a time where Herbert info-dumped, yet I knew the world as well as I could. That is talent, and something I love in Sci-Fi.The setting is perfect. Seriously. Anything desert related, whether it be movies or books, I love. Especially now that it is set in the future. Water is sparse. They can't even cry...ah! I love it. Herbert created a very fascinating indigenous group, and also somehow found a way for me to feel anxious while I was reading.Water! Don't run out of water!The Fremen seemed so in control of everything, but honestly I think I would hang myself if I had to live in that tribe. The thought of not having water is so scary. And I need showers, else I could, quite literally, go bonkers. ""Deep in the human unconsciousness is a pervasive need for a logical universe that  makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic"" -""The Sayings of Muad'Dib"" by the Princess Irulan.The Harkonnens were awesome enemies. The Baron was so gross, though. Which I guess is a good trait in a villain. They really did him well in the film (can we please appreciate that acting and make up?!). Actually, come to think of it, the casting for the movie is exceptionally done. Rebecca Ferguson is probably my favourite actress, and I think she did a great job with Jessica, especially at the start of the book.The characters aren't exactly charismatic. With that being said, I did still like Paul, Leto and Jessica a fair amount. The side characters might be better than the main ones. My favourites were Gurney and Stilga. Just know that characters are not the strong point of this book......unlike the world-building. Herbert created such an incredible world that is truly jaw dropping, as you know you haven't even made a dint in the lore and politics. It is just so creative. Very atmospheric and majestic, some of best and most impressive I've read. I don't really understand the readers who say that the world-building is non-existent throughout the book. It is very much present, and very well done. If you are a world-building nerd, you'll love this, as the world was just so incredible. Things like the 'thopters were so creative (as well as the sandworms). Such unique concepts, even to todays standards. That is another thing that is amazing about this book; it is very unique. Way ahead of its time. When I was reading it, I was like ""You really just thought of that, Frank? Blue eyes? Worlds controlled by spice? Bug looking helicopters? C'mon, man."" Really though, if the director does this next film right, they could become among the greatest Sci-Fi movies of the of all time. And plus the first one stayed very close to the book. Don't chuck a Peter Jackson on us, Dennis! Am definitely looking forward to it.Before I get into some very tiny cons, I have to discuss the messages this book puts forth. The way it presented these ideas--through economical, political and religious power--was very thought provoking. All the characters in this book uses the above powers to hurt people for their own benefit. It is honestly disruptive when you think about how it resembles things in our society. How so much human suffering has come from political power designed to manipulate the people, as well as how some figures rise to power. There are just...so many things in this book to look deep into and discuss, practically begging a reread (which I'll certainly do at some point). But man, it really was thought-provoking, in more ways than what I mentioned (not to mention the innumerable philosophical aspects).Two cons for me, would be:1. The writing is so strange. I feel like I could never capture the setting or the scenery properly because it just wasn't explained right! Might just be me, but it annoyed me, on multiple occasions, how I never knew whereabouts the character were and what it looks like around them!2. The middle of Book III was a bit boring. It took me awhile to get through it, but the ending climax was very much worth it. (Damn, Paul, why you gotta do Rautha like that?).But, that's really it. I loved this book. I don't mean that lightly, I adored it. Those issue above are just small nitpicks, so I am still going to give it an easy 5 stars. It is just an awesome work of literature. Slow, complex and majestic, this is a must-read not just for Sci-Fi fans, but all readers. A book for the ages."

I'm glad I got over my fear of reading this bookEver since I started reading again, I've seen thatDune had been a book that is a MUST read. And I've always been scared to pick it up because it's a long, classic sci-fi novel. I can finally say I conquered Dune! Unfortunately, I think I hyped this book up too much for myself...Let me start by saying this: Parts 1 & 2 were amazing! Part 1 was a lot of getting to know the setting, the plot, and the characters. It had great dialogue, intriguing concepts, and an explosive end. Part 2 had a shift in pacing and was slower, but was fascinating to read from and got a lot of character development. Part 3 is where this book really tanks it for me. It was honestly gruelling to get through. It felt like I was reading a totally different book! I wasn't really happy with how some of the characters' arcs played out and I wasn't satisfied with the ending in any way. It was just a huge let down!I really enjoyed how water is seen a sacred currency (priceless, even) in this book. The environmental topics and themes that Herbert incorporated here pose really thought provoking discussions and I loved reading about them. The character in the first two acts were so engaging and I really cared for them, especially Lady Jessica. I loved seeing a bad ass woman have power over these men! BUT, for some reason, I feel that Herbert SEVERELY under-used her potential. Her character is quite literally one of the most powerful characters in the story, and yet I still felt that she wasn't used to her full capacity (maybe this is rectified in later instalments). On that note, I wanted to talk about one of the common criticisms of this novel: the women. I've seen that a lot of people didn't think that the women in this novel were treated with much respect or that they were written poorly. At first, I didn't see that because Lady Jessica was first written to be this uber powerful woman. And then came the ending of Part 2 and all of Part 3, where the women just seemed to be concubines for the men, despite their actual power ranks. Even Chani, who is the other strong female character, gets pushed to the background in Part 3. How people talked to the women were starting to really get on my nerves! Just didn't make sense. Another of the criticisms I read was that Herbert was appropriating Arabic cultures. And that criticism became more apparent as you work your way through the novel. The language, the societal and cultural norms as well as religious beliefs seemed like they were taken from typical stereotypes of Arabic cultures, which felt really off to me. The last thing I'll criticize is the actual plot. When I finished this book, I was like, ""Oh, so now I have to read the rest of the series to get the whole story now"", which I can say is my own fault due to lack of research on if this book could stand on its own (It can't. It has an abrupt ending). The first 3 quarters of this book was so interesting and juicy to read, but now it just all feels like set up for the next books. Anyways, this review is getting long enough lol. I hope that the movie can correct these problems that are apparent in the book. I still think this book does have its place in history and is extremely influential. While reading it, I couldn't help but see its influence in things like Star Wars and even The Wheel of Time. If you like slow builds and politics in your books, then possibly check this one out. I also demand to see more worms!"

Cada uno lleno de reflexiones, de revelaciones y de momentos sumamente interesantes que te generaban diferentes emociones y es que podíamos saber sobre cada personaje, qué hacían, dónde estaban, qué estaban planeando, etc, etc, etc. Además, existe una gran gama de personajes con personalidades y habilidades que me hicieron amarlos, y si bien Paul Atreides es el protagonista y vaya que me gustó mucho, sobre todo su evolución, mi favorita ha sido la Dama Jessica, una Bene Gesserit, la considero una mujer inteligente, valiente y poderosa. Otros personajes de los cuales quedé fascinada han sido Gurney Halleck y Duncan Idaho, y claro, el Duque Leto, pero no diré nada más sobre ellos porque sería spoiler para quien no ha leído este libro. En cuanto a los Fremen, me han sorprendido bastante como tribu, por sus costumbres religiosas así como aquellas para preservar la poca agua que tienen. Pues literal valoran cada pequeña gota. Además de como se han adaptado para vivir en un planeta tan hostil y centrar gran parte de sus esfuerzos para cambiar la superficie de Arrakis y que en un futuro ""llegará el día. Agua a cielo abierto, plantas verdes y altas, gente caminando sin destiltrajes""Y no olvidemos que también son guerreros excepcionales que no sólo se han enfrentado los Harkonnen sino también a los Sardaukar. De los Harkonnen y del Emperador Shaddam IV no tengo nada más que decir que tienen mi odio eterno. Y lo último que diré es que estaba más que emocionada por saber más sobre los Shai-hulud, los gusanos de arena. Me resultaban fascinantes. PD: ¡Lea DUNE!"

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
 Dune can be easily listed as one of the most difficult books, that I have ever read. Under the guise of a science fiction, this book can easily be classified as a treatise on existentialism, philosophy, politics, region, war manual(?) I honestly don't have the capability to ""review"" this cult classic.My only dilemma is how to rate this book?Should I rate this magnum opus for its sheer brilliance? the extent of themes and issues that his book deals with? all the philosophical discourse that forms an inherent core of the story? Or should I rate this book for the author's imagination for giving us this story, progressive to such an extent that it wont grow old even if one reads it in the next decade or four?But, how do I reconcile to the fact that I hated the protagonist right from the very beginning? No matter how much I tried, I never warmed up to him. Nevertheless, the other characters kind of made up for my irritation towards him.Will I read the sequel? No, not yet. Why? Tbh, I didn't even get half the things, that this one set out to portray. There are so many subtle, hidden nuances within this book, I need to read it again and again, to fully understand it.So a 3.25- I-am-in-awe-and-equally-humbled-with-this-book-starsP.S.: I partially read the book and part listened to the audio. The audio production requires a special mention here. Its one of  T.H.E. B.E.S.T. audio books I've read till date."

Poco da aggiungere, la prova è il fatto che in qualsiasi opera fantasy e fantascientifica postuma si può chiaramente sentire almeno l'eco della saga di Herbert.Dune ha, senza dubbio, uno dei world building più solidi che io abbia mai letto. I personaggi sono assolutamente unici e in loro si fondono perfettamente la tendenza tipicamente umana al materialismo e una consapevolezza, quasi profetica, di essere destinati a qualcosa di più di semplice amore o potere o ricchezza.Sono già pronta alla lettura del secondo libro, più che altro perché mi affascina enormemente il personaggio di Paul e ho la sensazione che Herbert abbia preparato una bella decostruzione dei leader spirituali e dei personaggi messianici in generale, nei prossimi libri."

Es la novela más importante de la historia de la ciencia-ficción, El Señor de los Anillos del género. Es, junto con la Fundación de Asimov, la razón por la que me hice psicólogo. Nunca me canso de volverla a leer.Dune es una de las revisiones más potentes que se han hecho nunca sobre qué pasaría si nos dedicáramos a desarrollar nuestras capacidades psicológicas más allá de nuestra tecnología. Es especialmente relevante hoy día, con toda la preocupación acerca de si Google nos vuelve perezosos. Los personajes de Dune optaron por el camino opuesto.Dune se sitúa en un futuro tan lejano que es casi inconcebible. Un futuro en el que las armas y defensas han evolucionado tanto que la gente ha tenido que volver a los duelos a espada y cuchillo... con escudos de energía. Hay seres humanos que han desarrollado capacidades de cálculo que empequeñecen a nuestros ordenadores de hoy día, porque tras una mala experiencia la creación de IAs está prohibida. Órdenes secretas de mujeres capaces de controlar con la Voz, de convertir venenos en sustancias inofensivas dentro de sus cuerpos, navegantes que usan su mente aumentada por la especia (la mayor riqueza del universo) para adivinar los caminos seguros que guían a las naves por el espacio...No hay un mundo más rico ni más vivo que este en toda la ciencia-ficción. Es fractal, no importa cuánto aumentes siempre hay más. Religión, política, comercio, guerra, todo...La novela se centra en el nacimiento de un mesías en el planeta más importante e inhóspito del universo, cómo este chico trata de evitar ese destino y cómo la religión lo moldea todo. Es complejo, es fascinante y es terriblemente humano. He puesto un marcador en cada página con una cita digna de recordar, y el libro parece un puercoespín con las púas amarillas.Si sólo podéis leer una novela de ciencia-ficción, leed Dune. Puede que los siguientes 5 libros de la saga escritos por Herbert (POR DIOS, ignorad completamente las novelas escritas por su hijo y el otro innombrable) ya os parezcan demasiado chanantes. Pero leed Dune. Leed Dune y aprended cosas sobre nosotros como especie que no sabemos.Y recordad que la especia debe fluir, siempre."

Без това качество дори случайното величие ще смаже човека.“„Дюн“ е брилянтен и многопластов роман, който напълно заслужено е смятан за една от най-великите научнофантастични творби! Чрез нея Франк Хърбърт определено популяризира екологията и полага основите на екологичната фантастика, но книгата далеч не се изчерпва с тази тема. Авторът елегантно е вложил в историята своите задълбочени размисли по философски, политически, научни, религиозни и други значими въпроси. Сюжетът е майсторски заплетен и представен от гледните точки на различни герои... Персонажите са друго огромно достойнство на Дюн, тъй като са изключително добре изградени и въздействат емоционално на читателите! Обожавам лейди Джесика, която е страхотен образ и се превърна в един от най-любимите ми литературни герои изобщо! Нейният син Пол също страшно много израства като личност по време на своите приключения... Преместването на рода Атреидски на Аракис ги изправя пред много трудности и политически интриги. Тази планета е пустинна и съответно условията за живот са доста сурови, но същевременно е важна за империята, заради добиваната единствено на нея ценна подправка. Пол усърдно се обучава, за да бъде достоен наследник на своя баща дук Лито, а впоследствие трябва да се съюзи със Свободните, както и да се пребори с жестоките си врагове Харконен...„Пол знаеше, че Джесика се боеше от религиозните взаимоотношения между него и свободните. Не й допадаше това, че хората както от заслоните, така и от грейбъна говореха за Пол като за някакво божество. И тя тръгваше да разпитва сред племената или разпращаше своите сайядини на разузнаване, като събираше отговорите им и умуваше над тях.  Беше му цитирала някаква бин-джезъритска поговорка: „Когато религията и политиката се возят в една и съща колесница, конниците смятат, че нищо не може да им се изпречи на пътя. Те започват да препускат стремглаво — все по-бързо и по-бързо, и по-бързо. От главата им изхвръква всякаква мисъл за препятствия и забравят, че когато човек препуска слепешком, той съзира пропастта едва когато е вече твърде късно.“"

Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by training.”― Frank Herbert, DuneRead my reviews from my blog: https://readwithsefan.blogspot.com/20...Looks like it's a book almost everyone in my list has read. Now I feel really late reading it. It took me ages to finish it, but it was worth reading. I can see why it's great. We didn't have anything like this world after Dune. I really loved this book. It invokes thought so much. When I heard there's a special edition of this book is coming I just immediately grabbed it. It was really beautiful edition. I loved reading it. Though I can't say I re-read this book after I had already read it on an older edition. It's still hard to get along. So that's it. Don't say I didn't warn you. Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of value is the “spice” melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for...When House Atreides is betrayed, the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream.“Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things..."" she held up four big-knuckled fingers.

Perché è inutile sapere la bozza della trama, aver capito che c'è un pianeta deserto con dei vermi giganti, essersi informati sulla diatriba sci-fi contro space opera o conoscere più o meno i nomi dei personaggi.Dune è quel libro che dopo 50 anni ancora ha qualcosa di non banale da dire, e lo dice in un modo bellissimo. Perché c'è l'ambizione di voler intrecciare un affresco politico degno di questo nome, ci sono i personaggi, non scritti bene, non disegnati, ma veri, c'è una grande lezione di ecologia, ma anche di umanità, ma soprattutto ci sono i dettagli. Infiniti dettagli, su qualsiasi cosa venga scritta, su qualsiasi pensiero formulato, su tutto l'equilibrio di un sistema-mondo. Ed ecco che esplode il potere visivo dell'opera, l'immaginazione galoppa, i sensi partecipano, e tu su Arrakis ci sei davvero.Dune è anche quel libro che si perde un po' in un finale spiazzante, ma in fondo anche un po' affascinante, tanto è insolito.In generale, è quel libro che è riuscito a tenermi incollata alle pagine come una droga della peggior specie, come non mi succedeva da non so quanto tempo, tant'è che l'ho letto a ritmi ormai appartenenti ai bei tempi andati, che dopo l'apatia post-Martin mi ha fatto di nuovo pensare ""ohh, un libro degno delle Cronache!""...

220,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara,Rating 3 out of 5,"Everyone who enjoys Star Trek or Star Wars probably owes a huge debt to Frank Herbert. Dune preceded both of them, and was the first sci-fi book to prove that sci-fi could appeal to the masses, not just a small group. It is foundation, and it fathered a plethora of copy-cats and sincere imitators. In that regard, I bow to Mr. Herbert. It was interesting enough to make me follow through to the end...I wanted to know how Paul would pull this off, where it would leave him, and what would happen to all those other interesting characters we began the book with. However, it is proof positive that this just isn’t my genre. I do not want, in the least, to read any other book in the series. There is more at the heart of this book than just a battling galaxy or a struggle for control of a planet. It is about ecology, power, corruption, betrayal and all those other ugly things people are always either pushing or battling. It is about one class trying to control another, and it skirts the subjects of religion and spirituality. But, for me, it never reached the level of making any profound statements on any of those subjects. It was much like watching one of those Star Trek movies it reminded me of, a bit of fun that isn’t likely to affect you to the point of hindering your ability to sleep."

This was some formative sci-fi in my youth and while the details are murky the sentiment was clear - I loved this as a kid. It's been on the want to re-read shelf forever but you know how it is with things you loved as a child. I mean have you tried to watch Dukes of Hazzard as an adult? You wonder what kind of a moron you were in grade school. The Atreides aren't just some good ole boys, never meaning no harm (my God, what sort of a hole have I dug myself here) and Dune did not disappoint. The first half had me hooked and I would have happily plodded along as House Atreides settled on Arrakis. I loved the political intrigues, the backroom dealings, and the strategies inside strategies. I gobbled up the pseudo-religious talk and the historical notes and read it again as an ecological warning. I generally don't read these sort of sprawling epics and even now I'm hesitant to read any more of the series (though it looks like I'm in relatively good hands with the first trilogy) Even if my time with the Fremen ends here, this was just the sort of indulgent clunker of a classic that I needed right now and can only hope that Denis Villeneuve once again manages to film the unfilmable."

223,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is one of those books that I've always thought that I should read, but never actually wanted to read, simply because I thought that it would have to be tedious and dry and, I hate to say it, boring. Which goes to show what a poor book-cover judge I am, because this book was anything but tedious, dry or boring. In fact, one of the first things that struck me about this book was the readability and fast-paced action and intrigue. So much happened in such a short amount of time, that I'd have to go back and read sections over again to be sure that I understood everything that had happened. Good stuff. I have to say that I loved Herbert's writing style. It's deceptively simple and to the point... until 10, or 30, or 100 pages later when you realize that what seemed so simple and unimportant was a set-up for a revelation later, and your brain (or mine, at least) has this little ""AHA!!"" moment, and you feel so smart for figuring out exactly what you were so expertly and subtly led to figure out. Just imagine the possibilities for multiple readings... This book is one which can be read a dozen times and still reveal hidden nuggets of goodness. Herbert's world, or universe, was so intriguing to me. I loved the political structure of having major and minor power families, an emperor, a 3rd party Guild to manage trade, and the 3rd party Bene Gesserit women, who sort of control-prophesy-manipulate to reach an end. The skills of the people inhabiting Herbert's universe are incredible, and so much based on mind-control. Not necessarily power over another's mind, although there is that, but I mean control over your OWN mind, to the point where instinctive reactions and involuntary bodily functions can be subverted and held in check, simply by will. I loved Dune, as in the planet Arrakis, and the people who inhabited it, except of course for the Harkonnen jerk-faces. The Fremen are interesting and resourceful and bad-ass and wise, and are able to accept their lot, while trying to make a better lot for future generations. We could take a page out of their books, I think. We should be improving our planet, ensuring its inhabitability for as long as we're able (at least until the sun implodes and kills us all), but instead, we're polluting with reckless abandon, as if the planet is able to just reset with each generation. Herbert's characters are some of the most interesting that I've read about as well. I loved that he infused a clear-cut Good vs. Bad struggle with deviousness and subtlety, and then on top of that, threw in characters that had to make choices that left you wondering who was real and whether they acted of their own accord or if there was something more... I loved the Atreides. They were, to me, the pinnacle of honor-bound deviousness. That seems strange to say, but I mean it in the best way possible. They were devious only to try to detect and prevent deviousness against them, and to right wrongs that have gone on for generations of animosity between houses. I do wish that there was a reason given that the Atreides house was singled out for this treatment, but reading between the lines, it seems that greed and power-mongering was the cause, and the Atreides were honest enough to stand against it, and so became the enemy. This book is one that has a great many moral and religious and life-lesson undertones, which is a fine line to walk in any book for me, as I really, really dislike being lectured to. But I think that Herbert handled this all very well, and I was able to read it without feeling as though there was a wagging finger in my face. Overall, I really, really enjoyed this book. The only reason that I am not able to give this 5 stars is that I felt like the entire book was leading up to a spectacular ending... but the ending drug on for just a bit too long and wasn't as spectacular as I'd hoped that it would be. It was a good ending to a very good book, but I felt that it just could have been a little bit more. I definitely recommend this book though. It's entertaining and informative and prescient and timely as well as timeless. Just go read it already. :)"

Part 1 now annoyed me a lot (Paul was an unbearable Gary Stu, I hate Bene Gesserit, fatshaming an already gross villain, dichotomy on women with logic etc etc) Oh indeed my older self became more critical compared to my first read (see below three-star review back in 2009). Even though I knew the ending I just do not want to experience 300 pages more of this, even though I did like the Fremen. But the question is that do I really want to spend precious time reading about all the things above, added with the 'legal concubine' stuff? DNFed at page 210. One star dropped. Many books await me. Bubye!Original review (2009):I liked the idea offered from this book. The adventure and the sci-fi elements were definitely promising. The planet and the ways of living of the people to cope with the harsh environment were interesting. Too bad, the characterization plus some of the plots were not according to my taste. Some were killed off too fast, the others were...well,simply boring and predictable. The first part was awesome (edit: or was it?), the second and the third lost me. The final battle did not offer the highest dramatic tension as hoped. Plus, I found the philosophical nuances (and whatnot) a bit tiring. I wanna see more action, for Verne's sake! To complete my rambling here: I got the feeling that this book is somewhat misogynistic. Not only because I don't like reading books with concubines in it, mind you.But hey, since I appreciated the ideas offered, I'm still gonna give it a three-star rating. Doesn't mean I'm gonna read it the second time in the near future though."

Aunque siempre escuché de Dune, no tenía la más mínima de idea de qué se trataba porque nunca leí ni la sinopsis (tampoco lo hice ahora, vi el trailer y me lancé a leerlo). Solo puedo decir que entiendo completamente por qué tiene la fama que tiene, me encantó como no pensé que lo haría.El Duque Atreides y su familia son enviados a Arrakis por orden del emperador, ahí se viene una traición hacia el duque por parte de alguien que no espera. Todo está dentro de un plan mayor, pero nadie sabe quién hizo realmente ese plan. Cuando Paul y su madre deben sobrevivir en Arrakis buscan la ayuda de los Fremen, personas del desierto que conocen el planeta como nadie lo hará nunca.Es muy difícil decir de qué va el libro, porque aun terminándolo quedas con la sensación de que solo fue el inicio de algo mucho más grande. Sí, pasan muchas MUCHAS cosas en este libro, pero al mismo tiempo son preparaciones de algo. Personajes empezando el camino al que están destinados, personajes entendiendo su rol en un panorama más grande y cosas así.Incluso el libro juega con los inicios de capítulos pues son fragmentos de libros de historia que narran lo que recién nos están contando. Muchas cosas las sabemos desde antes por esos mismos fragmentos, pero contrario a lo que se podría esperar no quitan emoción sino que solo la aumentan. Saber qué algo iba a pasar no volvió tediosa la espera, por el contrario, le agregó tensión.Siempre creí que el libro era lento y denso, pero no es así. Hay mucha información, es cierto, aunque nunca es algo difícil de manejar, por el contrario, resulta tan interesante que siempre quieres saber más. En mi opinión, la información está bien dada, no nos abruman con datos y explicaciones, ni siquiera en los apéndices. Siempre es bastante amigable con las explicaciones. Por otro lado, sí, es lento, pero no en el mal sentido. Muchas cosas pasan, aunque son del tipo de conspiraciones, traiciones, rituales, no escenas de acción. Lo que no me molesta. Disfruté mucho el libro incluso desde el inicio. Dentro de lo mismo, las batallas no son narradas, nos cuentan lo que sucedió y para mí está bien. Las escenas que sí nos narra con detalle son las peleas uno a uno.No es que el mundo me resulte de por sí algo fascinante, pero está tan bien construido todo que me encanta. La línea entre religión y ciencia es confusa, lo mismo con las leyendas y profecías. No deja de ser un libro muy científico, pero que entiende el poder de la religión en las personas. A los humanos siempre nos ha movido la religión y el poder de la fe en algo más grande, más que el poder de la ciencia y sus promesas empíricas. Aquí eso se refleja de una forma muy interesante, con distintas instituciones/familias/grupos económicos manipulando ya sea ciencia o religión para conseguir lo que quieren.Adoré al Duque Leto, en serio, pensé que sería un personaje más serio y déspota, pero era todo lo opuesto. Un equilibrio entre ser un duque y un líder estricto y un hombre de familia y amante. Había algo increíblemente adorable en él y en las relaciones con sus cercanos. La Dama Jessica también me gustó, su disputa por ser tanto Bene Gesserit y como madre de Paul, su forma astuta de leer a las personas y saber qué decir para obtener lo que quiere. Era una mujer fascinante. Paul también me gustó, es un personaje complejo de entender por su rol y todo lo que significa. Entiendo que no actúe como su edad lo pide. Ciertos momentos desde su punto de vista cuando el tiempo se volvía confuso y no sabía lo que era recuerdo y lo que era una visión me gustaban mucho. La narración desde el punto de vista de distintos personajes nos permite comprenderlos mucho mejor de cómo se ven solo por sus acciones o actitudes. Paul se ve de una forma muy distinta a todo lo que está pasando dentro de él, a sus maquinaciones, sus intentos de encajar y de evitar sus visiones. Lo mismo con la Dama Jessica. Quizá por eso me gustó tanto el libro, porque pude estar dentro de la cabeza de los personajes y comprenderlos muy bien.A pesar de que lo terminé anoche sigo algo dispersa, solo puedo saber que mientras más lo pienso más me gusta. Incluso leer los apéndices hizo que me gustara más y más. No sabía qué esperar y estoy gratamente sorprendida con lo que encontré en este libro, se merece toda la fama que tiene."
230,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49037310-oliver,Rating 5 out of 5,"I will say this straight away - DUNE might just be one of the favorite books I have ever read. It is undeniably one of the most influential Sci-Fi novels to exist and I will recommend that most people should at least try to read it - it might just surprise you as it did me. I will keep specific details on the actual novel very sparse apart from a few great quotes as that is how I entered it and I believe that is the best way. ""The proximity of a desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.""The very first thing that compelled me was the writing itself. Dune is contemplative by nature - it makes the reader think with every word on every page. The novel is filled to the brim with quotable lines that tend to stay with you. I was actually surprised by how much I liked the writing since I was quite intimidated by the book before starting it but it turned out there was nothing too difficult there. In fact, I would say it reads better than many modern novels. ""It's the look of terrible awareness, she thought, of someone forced to the knowledge of their own mortality.""The next thing that immediately kicks you with awesomeness is the worldbuilding. Dune is stellar in building up cultures and religions. It can be a little heavy-handed in the beginning with all the terms and expressions but I promise that if you pay attention and just let it all flow over you then you will deeply appreciate everything Frank Herbert has done with building up Arrakis and the broader world of Dune. The novel is also littered with awesome epigraphs that do a great job of giving you both hints about things to come and a better overview of things the reader has already experienced. ""Hope clouds observation.""The overall journey that the book follows is magnificent. The novel is comprised of a lot of dialogue, politics, and tension but it retains movement at the same time. It is done extremely well in my opinion although if books that focus solely on these things rarely compel you then you may have varying levels of enjoyment with the work. I thought it was grand and seeing our main character progress through the novel was pretty damn interesting. Something that really elevated the journey for me was the use of the third person omniscient POV. I had some fears before starting my readthrough but it just works so well when applied to a book with tons of political maneuvering. It is really interesting to see what everyone is thinking in a setting that focuses on backstabbing and intrigue. ""Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.""And with this, my gushing review just about comes to an end. There are plenty more things to say about this book although 99% of them point to the same conclusion: It is a magnificent piece of fiction and will forever be a book that I will cherish. “Fear is the mind-killer.”"

Ir turiu pripažinti, kad išties džiaugiuosi jog taip nutiko, mat Anitos Kapočiūtės vertimas vertas itin aukšto balo ir man reikės kaip reikiant pasistengti, kad nuo jos neatsilikčiau.Kaip jau esu įpratęs daryti su serijomis, pernelyg į turinį nesileisiu ir šįkart atkreipsiu dėmesį į vieną aspektą, ypač aktualų fantastinei literatūrai ir galbūt netgi suteikiantį jai tam tikrą pranašumą prieš realistiškesnius kūrinius. Kalbant apie veikėjus ir siužetą, kurio ribose jie veikia, nelengva sugalvoti ką nors unikalaus. Pasidomėjus mitologijos žinovų, istorikų ir literatūrologų atliekamomis pasakojimo analizėmis, paaiškėja, kad tie patys kertiniai veikėjams būdingi charakterio bruožai ar pagrindiniai siužeto vingiai kartojasi daugybėje įvairiausių pasakojimų (herojaus kelionė, teigiamas arba neigiamas veikėjo pokytis, kerštas, kova tarp abstraktaus arba konkretesnį pavidalą įgavusio gėrio ir blogio, atsispyrimas pagundoms, perdėtas pasipūtimas ir t. t.). Taigi, kas tuomet paverčia kūrinį išskirtiniu? Atsakymas – aplinka, pasaulis, kuriame vyksta veiksmas.Ir štai čia fantastika (tiek maginė, tiek mokslinė) gauna progą sužibėti ryškiausiomis spalvomis. Juk jos pasaulis gali būti praktiškai bet koks ir tas unikalus kontekstas padeda klišinius siužeto ar veikėjų aspektus pateikti visiškai kitokioje šviesoje. Pasiekęs „Kopos“ pabaigą supratau, kad autorius tai puikiai išnaudojo. Turime atšiaurų, žmonėms gyventi netinkamą dykumos pasaulį, kurio fauna ir ekologija glaudžiai ir apgalvotai susijusios ir nuolatos daro įtaką veikėjų kasdieniam elgesiui bei sprendimams. Pasakyti, kad kosmose šaudoma iš lazerių – nieko naujo. Bet susieti lazerius su dažniausiai naudojama apsaugos kovoje priemone – jėgos lauko skydu – taip, kad šie du dalykai vienas kitą neutralizuotų, yra svarbus niuansas. Pridėkime dar ir kokybiškai išplėtotą religinį aspektą, vedantį link labai neblogų ir lengvai realybėje pritaikomų filosofinių pamąstymų (būtinai perskaitykite knygos priedus apie tai), ir visai nekliudo faktas, kad karalystę bandančio atgauti kilmingo jaunuolio istorija tikrai matyta ne kartą ir ne du. Arba, kad veikėjų gebėjimas numatyti ateitį yra vienas iš tokių dalykų, per kuriuos autoriai dažnai netyčia prisiverda sau košės ir rizikuoja sugadinti visą kūrinį ar seriją.Knygą būtinai rekomenduoju dar jos neskaičiusiems fantastikos mėgėjams. Žinau, kad jie dažniausiai renkasi knygas originalo kalba, bet šis vertimas tikrai vertas dėmesio. O kažkada kitais metais sulauksime ir antrosios dalies lietuvių kalba – ieškokite ten mano pavardės."

Maybe this is why so many people over history have enjoyed the first novel but never read any of the rest of the saga? It's definitely a great book, for those who have never read it before: a combination of elaborate cultural backstory (ala JRR Tolkien), the far-flung future of humanity (ala Asimov's Foundation series), and a grand Eastern-influenced vision that evokes ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" the original novel combines a Shakespearean tale of family intrigue with the trippy '60s elements of alternate realities and messiah-figure destiny. But yeah, let's face it; the older you are, the faster you'll be skipping over the pages upon pages of ponderous purple prose on display here, muttering to yourself the whole time, ""Okay, okay, I get it, Paul senses something wrong.

I expected to be confused by this book, but I found it fairly easy to understand and follow. So if fear of confusion is the only thing holding you back, then ignore that fear. FEAR IS THE MIND-KILLER! I didn’t know much about this story aside from: science, sandstorms, and giant worms. And I was surprised by how much I liked Paul, even though he wasn’t a character I would generally expect to like. I don’t want to spoil anything, but the similarities between Dune and a certain Disney movie is uncanny.I will say that I didn’t love the ending. Frank Herbert did a great job of knowing when to take his time telling the story and when to jump ahead in the story’s timeline to effectively keep the reader interested. But the ending felt like it was rushed, it took too long for us to reach this point in the story, and when it finally did it was over in the snap of your fingers. "

239,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58516721-dijana,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ljudi moji.Iskrena da budem jako sam skeptična bila po pitanju ove knjige. Naplašila sam se čitajući i slušajući razne komentare toliko da sam mislila kako je ovo neko čudovište od knjige koje ja nikako neću razumeti.Međutim, desio se taj jedan trejler za film gde sam ja skontala da jednostavno moram ovo da pročitam što pre, tako da evo nas ovde.Pre nego što počnem sa svojim utiscima, bitno je napomenuti da je ovo jedno od prvih kapitalnih dela ovoga žanra, pa stoga treba uzeti u obzir nešto što je možda danas već kliše tada nije ni postojalo. Doduše, meni zaista neki mali klišei ovde nisu ni smetali, no nije zgoreg da se to i spomene.Prvo, zaista moram reći da mi nisu jasni komentari ljudi koji govore da nisu razumeli pola stvari, da je knjiga prepreprepuna opisa i da stil pisanja nije čitljiv. Ne znam da li je to do prevoda (ukoliko je to slučaj, moj dubok naklon Zoranu Živkoviću koji je ovu knjigu preveo na srpski jezik), ali meni je ova knjiga tekla toliko glatko da sam samo u jednom trenutku shvatila da sam prešla 500 stranica bez da razmislim o tome. Što se opisa tiče, pa, okej, ima ih, ali zar je to neočekivano kod naučnofantastičnog romana od 700 strana? Meni oni nisu bili nimalo dosadni i naporni, a išla sam toliko daleko da ne samo da sam pročitala svaki dodatak na kraju, već sam iščitala i rečnik pojmova (možda po prvi put u životu). Priča jeste jako spora, što moram da naglasim. S obzirom da sam pre ove knjige čitala jednu Sandersonovu knjigu, najlakše mi je da ih uporedim po tom pitanju: Warbreaker ne staje, Brendon nas tu drži na tihoj vatri stalno i baca nas sa jedne na drugu stranu na svakih tri do četiri poglavlja da mi nismo ni svesni da je zapravo prošlo nekoliko meseci. Kod Herberta je situacija drugačija - on nam priča o godinama koje su protekle tokom radnje ove knjige, o svetu koji se stvara, o likovima koji se grade i sve to na neki miran pripovedački način gde, čak i kada se desi neka akcija, mi nemamo taj nalet adrenalina kao što je to često slučaj. Meni to ovde zaista nije smetalo, no razumem ljude koji kažu da im je knjiga prespora i da se “vuče”. Jasno je da je Herbert ovde želeo da kaže toliko toga da mu sama akcija nije bila preterano u fokusu.Što se tiče likova, tu već moram reći da nemam ništa protiv toga kako ih je gradio, ali da mi sepreterano nisu dopadali. Čak mi ni sam Pol koji je naš glavni junak nije bio simpatičan, doduše mislim da nije ni bila poenta da bude. Likovi su bili onakvi kakvim su ih okolnosti i kultura u kojoj su odrasli napravili, i jako mi se dopadaju njihove međusobne razlike počevši od onih najdrastičnijih, pa sve do onih tananih. Moram dodati jedino da mi je u svetu gde su imena Halek, Leto itd normalna ime Džesika svaki put kada se spomene bilo pomalo smešno.Još uvek nisam načisto sa tim kakav je finalni utisak ova knjiga ostavila na mene. Jasno je da je ovo jedan od najvećih zalogaja za jednog pisca naučne fantastike, i da je Herbert ovde uzeo na sebe mnogo toga. Mnogo niti koje su protkane kroz ovu priču a pričaju o raznim dubokim stvarima čine ovu knjigu možda najzahtevnijim romanom ovog tipa koji sam pročitala. Doduše, finalni stav o nekim temama još uvek mi nije potpuno jasan.Pre nego što sam uzela ovu knjigu, čitala sam mnogobrojne komentare o tome kako ova knjiga može da se čita samostalno (odnosno, da nije neophodno čitati nastavke kojih ima mnogo). Donekle se slažem sa tim. Priča nije završena, ali je radnja romana zaokružena u celosti. Ne postoji nikakav preokret na samom kraju, radnja nije naprasno prekinuta i zaista ne ostaje onaj “šta li će se desiti sledeće???” osećaj nakon što knjigu završite. Mislim da je tome umnogome doprinela sama dinamika knjige koja je, kao što sam već spomenula, poprilično mirna, pa samim tim je i njen kraj u tom nekom kontekstu miran. Ja lično još nisam odlučila da li ću nastavke čitati (jer sam čula da su dosta lošiji od prvog dela). Vreme će pokazati."

I am very surprised that I hadn't heard about it before it got picked as part of a Group Read. I am glad I decided to go ahead with this read and if nothing else, this book is one of it's kind.A future world, where there is intergalactic politics, mixed with some magic. Even though this is a future world, there is no major technology, instead we have feel of reading a historical book which is set in the future. This was definitely a unique way of writing a story.
""We've a three-point civilization: the Imperial Household balanced against the Federated Great Houses of the Landsraad, and between them, the Guild with its damnable monopoly on interstellar transport. In politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures.""
We have 15 yr old Paul Atreides (the heir apparent to Duke Leto Atreides and heir of House Atreides) along with his parents moving to the Desert Planet Arrakis (also known as Dune) to rule and attempt to bring about civilization. This is where the real story kicks-off and one act of betrayal spirals towards a Prophecy being fulfilled.
'Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things...' She held up four big-knuckled fingers. '..the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing...' She closed her fingers into a fist. '...without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!'
It's for us to find out, what kind of Ruler would Paul actually be.In Dune, Freeman are people living in the core of the desert. I read somewhere that the writer took reference from Tuareg tribe and Bedouin tribe to draft their living style.There are heavy influences of Middle Eastern culture to the book and it work's great with the story.Then there is the spice and the water, natural resources that play a very heavy hand and are responsible for a lot of major decisions by all the important characters in this book.And as the story progresses we see that everything revolves around politics and religion.
""When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders belive nothing can stand in their way.""

The problem's I had with the story:
--> The writing is really heavy and I had to re-read sentences to get the context in some places. There are lot of terminology that were new (part of the Dune world) and took some time getting used to.--> The ending felt a bit rushed, Paul growing up years were kind of skipped and we reached the climax of the story. The first half of the book was slower. Maybe it could have been balanced a bit better.--> Princess Irulan is the narrator of the story  But she is introduced at the end and does not have much role in this book, a bit disappointing. What happened to Chani at the end, I DID NOT LIKE IT.Even after the above mentioned problems, it would be a shame to give this anything less than a 4 star because overall this story is really really good.As part of the group discussion I realized that there is a movie based on the book. I sure have got to watch it now.P.S- Have you seen the movie and if yes, what do you think about it?"
241,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1843184-szplug,Rating 3 out of 5,"As kids, my older brother was a Dune guy, whereas I bowed at the altar of John Ronald Reuel—and neither of us could ever bring ourselves to meet fully in the other's territory. I have tried Frank Herbert's renowned series several times now but have yet to make it further than Dune Messiah, the succinct, but inferior, follow-up to his smash-hit series opener. Everything that constitutes this curiously prescient science-fiction champion appeals to me: an alluringly thoughtful and flush aeon-spanning back story; a desert planet from which is harvested the priceless spice that allows interplanetary travel; feuding and scheming noble houses within a middle-eastern-flavored interstellar Empire; human computers and gaberdine sects that have replaced forbidden machines; the super-cool Sardaukar, the soldier-fanatics of the regnant Padishah-Emperor; the young Duke with mysterious portents and genetic mysteries interwoven about his young stud self and his formidable mystic mother, and so on and so forth. It's all there for something to scratch all those itches and stoke all those fires and hoist itself up onto the same level as Tolkien's epic saga.Except that it didn't.Every time that I have returned to read this novel, I marvel at how much the first two-thirds suck me in, ramping up the tension and tautening the various strands of the conspiracy-bound story—and the introduction of the Fremen and their austere, feral, and ritualized Neo-Bedouin culture developed amidst an endlessly severe and brutal wasteland is the most brilliant component of this story that has several. And every time I can't believe that Herbert put all of that thought and imagination and effort into this puppy only to sink it with that terribly rushed and anti-climactic ending. With whiplash haste the Baron is toast, his nephew is skewered, the Emperor is debased, the Sardaukar humbled, the Fremen ascendant, and Paul Atreides the smiling blue-eyed boy of the moment. It's the same undue haste and how-in-the-hell-do-I-wrap-this-up? palmball that he uses to hopelessly mar the ending of the already flawed Dune Messiah. The tangled plots and machinations and generational maneuvering and betrayals and...THE END! PLOTS UNRAVELED! BAD GUYS SMOKED! BLAME PLACED ON MEDDLING KIDS NOTED! NEXT!It's quite obvious that I'm in the miniscule minority here—and I've heard similarly vehement complaints in a reverse manner from my brother concerning the good Professor—but the palpable disappointment I feel at what I consider Herbert's lamentable inability to finish a novel at near the same level with which he constructs the back story and fleshes out the opening sections becomes so intense that it bums me right the hell out. What's more, with nearly every reader warning me that the series gets progressively more obscure and turgid the further down the chain of sequels one ventures, I have never mustered the will to crack the spine of Children of Dune, let alone the infamous God Emperor. Ah, Frank, you brilliant innovator and miscegenetic culture breeder, how magical it could have been if only you had the moxie to finish what you started."
242,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3660666-bethany-beautifully-bookish-bethany,Rating 5 out of 5,"2021 rereadIt's been a decade since I last read this book, but I wanted to revisit it before the upcoming film. I'll tell you up front, I'm probably not an unbiased reviewer when it comes to Dune. I love it. I also have a lot of nostalgia for it because my husband and I read it together when we were dating! So are there things that haven't aged well? Yes, for sure.  *cough* Baron Harkonnen *cough* fatphobia & homophobia *cough*  Is it probably longer than it needed to be with uneven pacing? Sure, that is probably the case. But do I particularly care?.... Not really. Honestly, it is in some ways a product of its time, but it's also such an iconic piece of science fiction that has had such major ripple effects. Reading the introduction in this new edition by Brian Herbert is fascinating and offers a window into the ideas and inspiration that led to this. It explores religion, philosophy, politics, and power. Taken together with Dune Messiah, it subverts the white savior trope in a way that actually made people angry back when it was published. (I'm begging you, don't stop here! At least read book 2 because there are seeds of his intentionality in book 1 that might not become clear until you read Dune Messiah) It may not be a perfect book, but it is a favorite for me and one that was in some ways ahead of its time. Returning to this after a decade, I was surprised to find just how much of the book had really stuck with me in a way not many books do. This story and these characters have wormed their way in and I can't tell you how many times over the years I've thought of the litany for fear, for instance.  Fear is the mindkiller...  Anyway, I totally get that this won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I do think it's worth reading in a way that contextualizes the narrative Herbert was trying to tell. I'm still a fan!"

To be honest, I only decided to tackle this classic because of the film version having recently been released. Thought it was a great excuse to venture out of my literary comfort zone. So take this review with this in mind… Going into this I had expectations of it being an epic adventure right up there with Lord of the Rings & Game of Thrones. Unfortunately, I was disappointed that it did not live up to either. The story itself wasn’t bad but the world building felt overly descriptive which distracted from the character building. I didn’t really feel like I got to really know any of the characters, which made me much less invested. Also, the story was not as action packed as I was hoping for… actually a bit boring most of the way through. The ending was, also, pretty anti-climactic. I listened to this on audio which was supposed to be multi narrated but ended up being a jumble of alternate voices mixed in with single narrating. This was extremely distracting and I think if the narration had stayed consistent throughout my enjoyment of the actual story may have been greater. Sadly, though the movie followed the book fairly accurately it wasn’t the ‘epic’ I was expecting either. So, overall, a pretty disappointing venture through all formats. "

247,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56173179-ivana-books-are-magic,Rating 5 out of 5,"Dune, the first novel in the Dune series, is (in my view) absolutely one of those life-changing reads. The novel is wildly imaginative, set in an unique dystopian future and populated with some of the most memorable characters. Dune takes world building on a whole new level but at the same time, it speaks of our present human society. It is a very relevant novel that raises numerous questions about religion, power, politics and identity. As many science fiction works I admire, Dune asks the question- What does it mean to be human? Some of its characters exhibit or acquire superhuman abilities, but even they are often trapped by the constraints of human society and their own social programming. It is fascinating to observe the conflict between the individual and the society in this book so rich in meaning and philosophical questions. Dune is the best selling science fiction novel of all times- and deserving so. It wouldn't be far fetched to call it the best science fiction work of all times. When it comes to my personal reading experience, it is certainly one of the best novels I have read, science fiction or otherwise. Besides the absolute fascination the world building presented for me, I was (and still am) deeply fascinated with the individual characters. The psychological portrait of the characters is wonderful. The power structures in Dune are so well presented and an interesting area to study. There are so many fascinating societies within this dystopian world and they are all well presented in the characters themselves. Dune is a world of the future but one where technology is taboo. Space travel exists, but planets are ruled by feudal houses - all of them united under the rule of a single king. The emperor with the noble houses may seem at the top, but it is the secret societies that hold much power- such as the 'witches'. What is so ingenious about Dune is that all of this world building just flows with the plot and the introduction of characters. The plot of the novel starts when a noble family Atreides has to leave a water planet they rule in an exchange for Dune (Rakis), a desert planet where 'spice' (a mysterious substance that elongates life and hold the Empire together) is produced by giant worms. The descriptions of planets are fantastic and many interesting questions are raised in terms of ecology, the effect we have on nature (and vice versa).  Duke Leto, the patriarch of a family is a deeply honorable man loved by many. His only heir is Paul, a boy described as unusually small for his age (but very clever and promising). Paul's mother Jessica, a Bene Gesserit pupil, is officially a concubine to Leto but is treated and loved as a wife. The reason why Duke Leto hadn't married her are strictly political. The love that exists in this relationship will have many interesting consequences. The product of that love is Paul- a boy who is under a watchful eyes of everyone. Early on, Paul learns some important lessons:...“What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises—no matter the mood! Mood's a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset. It's not for fighting.” Dune starts of a story of a noble Atreides family and while it remains focused on this family (or the surviving members of it), with time Paul steps onto the scene. Indeed, it is Paul actions that change the course of history. Towards the end, there is no doubt who is the protagonist of this novel. As the young boy Paul risks his life to acquire supernatural abilities, we see him grown up into a man determined to do what it takes to save his family and claim what is his. However, what is the price Paul will have to pay? “Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.”It is interesting how the characters that were created in this novel haunt all the sequels and sometimes even repeat again. Lady Jessica survives in the sisterhood, Idaho lives on in his gholas and Paul/Leto survive through all the numerous Atreides descendants. Although I honestly love all the sequels, I won't deny there is some magic at work in this first book in the series. It contains so much within itself.

Tra due grandi famiglie la lotta si scatena sul pianeta delle dune, dov’è la nostra scena;dai loro screzi antichi nascon nuovi tumultie il sangue di fratelli scorre, dopo gli insulti…Un'atmosfera da tragedia shakespeariana aleggia, solenne, su ogni pagina di questo celebre romanzo; l'epos è ai livelli massimi, l'incedere è lento, ma sontuoso. Tutto tocca Herbert con la sua immaginifica penna: la politica, le lotte di potere, i tradimenti, l'amore, l'economia, la famiglia, la fedeltà, l'ecologia, l'imperialismo, la tecnologia, l'autodeterminazione dei popoli, la filosofia, la religione, la perdita, la dipendenza, il fanatismo, il lutto, la vendetta, la giustizia, la crescita, la tradizione, e molto altro ancora potrebbe essere aggiunto all'elenco.Lo straripante barone Harkonnen, che avrebbe dovuto essere interpretato da Orson Welles (cosa ci siamo persi!)L'opera è divisa in tre atti, il primo sembra una grande partita a scacchi in cui i due giocatori conoscono già tutte le mosse del loro avversario, o almeno così credono, in un crescendo di suspense che porta allo stravolgimento dello status quo; il secondo è a mio avviso il più debole, la narrazione si fa più frammentaria e tende a dilungarsi troppo sugli aspetti filosofici della vicenda -leggasi: infiniti soliloqui del protagonista e dei suoi sodali sul senso della vita-; il terzo atto invece ritrova freschezza, merito anche d'un salto temporale di qualche anno che riaccende la curiosità nel lettore uscito spompato dalla parte precedente, e si conclude con un finale epico, maestoso e tragico.L'Imperatore Padiscià, che avrebbe dovuto essere interpretato da Salvador Dalì (ripeto, cosa ci siamo persi!) I personaggi incarnano anch'essi archetipi shakespeariani: il principe defraudato che cerca vendetta, il traditore insospettabile, l'amico fedelissimo, la serva che la sa lunga, il padre morto e idealizzato, la veggente, l'usurpatore senza scrupoli, il consigliere doppiogiochista, impossibile non notare le somiglianze con l'opera del Bardo, specialmente osservando il modo in cui i personaggi interagiscono fra loro. È tutto molto teatrale, soprattutto i dialoghi.E ho amato particolarmente i dettagli delle tecnologie descritte e l’ambientazione desertica di Arrakis, il pianeta delle due lune, Dune; mi è sembrato quasi di sentire l'odore della sabbia intrisa di spezia.Il pericoloso Feyd-Rautha, che avrebbe dovuto essere interpretato da Mick Jagger (da Jagger a Sting il passo è più breve, lo riconosco) Notevoli, infine, le appendici, pensate per tutti coloro che proprio non vogliono staccarsi da una bella storia.In conclusione, m'è parso un libro tutt’altro che perfetto, ma ugualmente magnifico, i cui molti pregi fanno dimenticare i difetti. E venne il giorno in cui Arrakis si trovò al centro dell’universo, e l’universo, quasi, vi ruotava intorno."
249,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8717964-ioana,Rating 5 out of 5,"Nu am suficiente cuvinte care să descrie cu acuratețe aprecierea pe care o simt față de această capodoperă literară. Simt că orice aș spune pentru a descrie complexitatea și frumusețea acestei cărți este prea banal, prea modest. Cuvintele mele sunt mult prea sărace în comparație cu tot ceea ce veți găsi în interiorul acestui roman, însă nu există apreciere mai puternică pentru un autor decât citirea, recomandarea și promovarea creației sale, iar acest lucru vreau să-l fac și eu prin a vă îndemna să dați o șansă acestei povești. Pe parcursul acestei călătorii SF cititorul va întâlni situații greu de imaginat și contexte politico-sociale revelatorii pentru perioada pe care o traversăm în prezent, căci Herbert a dorit nu doar crearea unei saga care să atragă doar prin acțiune, intrigă și poveste, ci mai ales prin profunzimea subiectelor, vizând idei legate de ecologie și gândire sistemică, evoluția speciei umane care se poate transforma cu ușurință în declin în cazul în care oamenii, în goana nebună după posesiune și putere, se lăcomesc și nu mai țin seama de acele limite care nu ar trebui încălcate niciodată, iar aici mă refer la evoluția tehnologică care, după un anumit nivel, ar putea periclita rasa umană.Acțiunea cărții are loc în viitor, într-un imperiu interstelar feudal, în cadrul căruia se poartă lupte continue pentru supraviețuire. Puterea aparține celor capabili să înfăptuiască orice este necesar pentru crearea, gândirea, dobândirea și manevrarea armelor perfecte ce-i va aduce în vârful piramidei, acel loc pentru care s-au bătut și se vor bate întotdeauna cei care aspiră la poziții de conducere. În centrul acestui Imperiu Galactic se situează planeta Arrakis, cunoscută drept și planeta Dune. Deopotrivă inospitalieră și valoroasă, Dune reprezintă pretextul construit de Herbert pentru a da naștere unei povești cu bogate implicații filozofice, politice și religioase. Saga Dune constituie una dintre cele mai discutate și căutate serii din prezent, în ciuda faptului că aceasta a apărut cu câteva decenii în urmă, iar acest lucru se datorează caracterului ei (veșnic) modern, căci subiectele și temele dezbătute între paginile romanelor sunt mai actuale ca oricând, oferind cititorilor câteva ore de calitate petrecute în compania unor personaje ce traversează perioade edificatoare, reprezentative și în continuă schimbare pentru specia umană.Îmbrățișați provocarea oferită de Herbert și veți descoperi o lume nu cu mult diferită de a noastră, în care autorul explorează nenumărate idei și teorii din cele mai diverse științe precum filozofia, religia, politica, ecologia, psihologia.

Ήθελα έναν χάρτη του ηλιακού συστήματος στο οποίο βρισκόμαστε, ή έστω περισσότερες πληροφορίες γι’ αυτό όπως π.χ. πόσοι είναι οι πλανήτες, ποιοι κατοικούνται κλπ. Επίσης, τον πρωταγωνιστή, τον γιο του Δούκα, τον έλεγαν Πωλ Ατρείδη. Πωλ!! Όλοι είχαν ονόματα όπως Λίτο, Γκέρνι, Ντάνκαν, Θούφιρ, Στιλγκαρ και τον πρωταγωνιστή τον έλεγαν Πωλ!!Κι όμως τίποτε από όλα αυτά δεν ήταν αρκετό για να επισκιάσει τα θετικά του βιβλίου.Μου άρεσε ο επικίνδυνος κόσμος του Αρράκις με τις ερήμους, τα σκουλήκια της άμμου και τον ντόπιο πληθυσμό του, τους Φρέμεν, με τα γαλάζια δίχως καθόλου λευκό μάτια τους, τις αποστακτικές στολές για να μην χάνονται τα υγρά του σώματος τους και την εμμονή τους με την υγρασία.Παρ’ ότι στην αρχή τα ονόματα μου φαίνονταν πολλά, στην πορεία τα συνήθισα και μπορούσα εύκολα να ξεχωρίζω τους χαρακτήρες. Μου άρεσαν και ο Πωλ (παρά το άκυρο όνομά του) αλλά και η Λαίδη Τζέσικα (κι αυτό ψιλοάκυρο όνομα), ο πιστός Γκέρνι με τη μπαλισέτ του και ο Στίλγκαρ. Κι άλλοι χαρακτήρες είχαν ενδιαφέρον που για τον έναν ή τον άλλο λόγο δεν είδαμε αρκετά και προσωπικά τουλάχιστον θα ήθελα να μαθαίναμε περισσότερα γι’ αυτούς, όπως π.χ. ο πλανητολόγος Κάινς.Μέσα στις σελίδες του βλέπουμε την ιστορία ενηλικίωσης του Πωλ, μυστικές αδελφότητες, διαγαλαξιακά ταξίδια, προφητείες για έναν εκλεκτό, δηλητηριασμένες λεπίδε�� για πισώπλατα μαχαιρώματα, ίντριγκα και παιχνίδια εξουσίας. Τίθενται ζητήματα πολιτικής, φιλοσοφίας, θρησκείας, κοινωνιολογίας και οικολογίας και μέσα στην απλότητα της ιστορίας του γινόταν πολύπλοκο.Αν γραφόταν σήμερα ίσως να έλεγα ότι είναι λίγο κλισέ αλλά και τα κλισέ από κάπου ξεκινάνε.

251,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7317186-celeste,Rating 4 out of 5,"While the ending felt abrupt and a bit unsatisfying, I very much enjoyed this classic of the sci-fi genre. Dune is considered the science fiction equivalent of Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, and that comparison makes total sense to me. The epic scope of Herbert’s debut novel, the highly unique setting, the near fathomless depth of the world building, the slightly stilted dialogue that lends the story a classic air, and the mysticism surrounding the central plot all reminded me of Tolkien’s world. Knowing how many books followed this one and dug further into the mythos Herbert introduced here further establishes that link. But what Dune did for science fiction, how it helped propel the genre into the mainstream and show that it could appeal to literary readers, very much harkens to what Tolkien was able to do for the fantasy genre. Undoubtedly, the godfathers of genre fiction deserve our praise.Going into this book knowing what it did for the genre and understanding that it’s a classic actually helped me enjoy it more than I otherwise would have. There was so much philosophy and so little deliverance of promised action sequences that I can see why plenty of others have been disappointed by Dune. However, I try to read classics more leniently, with my focus on discovering what has enabled the book to not only stand the test of time, but how it influenced books that came after it. With this mindset, I enjoyed Dune far more than I would have otherwise. While it is in my opinion far from a perfect novel, I can absolutely see why it’s important.I found the characters interesting if often two-dimensional, but I found the world building and philosophy absolutely fascinating. I’m a sucker for religion in fiction, and Dune delivered that in spades. Herbert obviously had a brilliant imagination, and I’m glad to have read this novel before new movie is released later this year. I’ve never seen the original movie version, but after reading the book I’m incredibly excited to see this story play out on the big screen.A buddy read with TS, Emma, and Eon!"

'dune' perfectly embodies why i love fantasy/sci-fi so much: the political mind games, the genius creativity, the scope of discussions - it’s unbelievable how many topics frank herbert manages to touch on. i’m in awe.primarily, this is a book critiquing white saviourism and empire. it gives agency to both the colonised environment and people by outlining the ways that white settlers exploit indigenous peoples, their faiths, and lands. i also loved the environmental commentary. herbert highlights the intersection between environmentalism and colonialism through ecological explorations. i loved that the setting was given just as much attention as the main characters arei know this book can be controversial, and i think there's a lot to unpack with that. my stance is that the book does a fantastic job at depicting colonisation in its brutal & complex entirety. as frank herbert outlines: 'ecology is the science of understanding consequences' — i think that perfectly summarises the heart of this novel & herbert's intention with this storymy only critiques are that some of the female characters deserved better (when is that not the case, though), and i have mixed feelings about the last third of the book. it felt messy to me (but i did audiobook parts of it, and that could be why)on the whole, i think this is a mind-blowing sci-fi story that is unlike anything i’ve ever read before. i would love to reread in the future and further pick all these aspects apart, but for now, i'm very excited to continue onto book 2!!⊱ ─────── ⋆⋅ dune ratings ⋅⋆ ─────── ⊰dune - ☆☆☆☆.5dune messiah - ☆☆☆☆.5children of dune - ☆☆☆.75god emperor of dune - heretics of dune - chapterhouse: dune -"

I was just majorly confused for 75% of this book. And there was a stupid time jump, which i don't do well with reading time jumps (see Furyborn review), and that messed me up big time. Not to mention the audiobook cast. It's a great audiobook bc it has a full cast! but seriously they changed Paul's voice as he got older so there were like three different Paul's. that got me confused as well. Also the fact that this was written in the 60's makes it harder for me to read. But overall it was a fun adventure when i knew what was going on. I wouldn't say it's a new favorite or that i loved it, but it was enjoyable and a fun buddyread w Gwen my twin <3I'm excited for the movie and I think i'll probably enjoy it more because it will be visual.

There is a lot of action and intrigue in this novel which certainly gave it a cinematic feel. (I'm very excited to watch the new 2021 movie, because I feel a story like this will translate to the big screen very well.)Overall, I liked this story, but sadly never fell in love with it like other readers. It was incredibly tropey, and while I understand that it was the book created many of those tropes, I still struggle to get past how predictable the story felt. In a lot of ways this felt more like fantasy, with the space setting feeling like a backdrop. While I love to watch space fantasy, I rarely enjoy reading the subgenre. I am glad I read this one and would certainly be open to rereading it in the future. I hope it grows on me when I'm ready to experience it again. I know this book is so beloved and I really wanted it to become a new favourite."

No conocerás el miedo. El miedo mata la mente. El miedo es la pequeña muerte que conduce a la destrucción total. Afrontaré mi miedo. Permitiré que pase sobre mí y a través de mí. Y cuando haya pasado girare mi ojo interior para escrutar su camino. Allá donde haya pasado el miedo ya no habrá nada. Solo estare yo.
Segunda lectura de esta maravilla de la literatura, y me ha gustado tanto como la primera. Y con más bagaje he disfrutado ciertas cosas aún más.Esta es la historia de Paul Atreides, hijo del duque Leto y dama Jessica, gobernantes de un planeta designados por el Emperador para establecerse en el planeta Arrakis en lugar de los Harkonnen, quienes lo gobernaban hasta ahora. Durante el primer Libro (esta novela está dividida en 3 libros) veremos las tramas palaciegas de estos viles Harkonnen para destruir a la casa de los Atreides, mientras que en los dos restantes veremos la historia evolucionar. Habitando el planeta están los Fremen, un pueblo que vive de manera muy tribal, que llaman al planeta Dune, y que serán una fuerza a tener en cuenta.El libro contiene intrigas, aventuras, filosofía, y unos personajes muy bien escritos. Tras el final hay una serie de apéndices que te retratan situaciones ocurridas antes de la historia, y un glosario con terminología del Imperio,que nos sirve para saber más cositas de las que se mencionan de pasada en la historia.Si una vez llegado al final se quiere dejar así, es perfectamente viable, pues queda todo bien atado. Pero si se quiere seguir, hay más novelas para poder seguir leyendo. Una obra obligatoria para todo aficionado a la ciencia ficción.PD: La edición que tengo es una versión del diseño que hizo The portfolio society, y lleva las ilustraciones de Sam Weber, que son una auténtica pasada.Primera lectura--Nota importante, se me ha borrado la review que tenía hecha en la lectura original.--Una joya de la ciencia ficción, uno de los clásicos del género. Tiene una historia muy bien desarrollada con unas pocas pinceladas previas de información, donde la conjura y las tramas palaciegas llevan gran parte del libro. Unos personajes que me gustaron mucho, que también tienen, en mayor o menor medida, un desarrollo.Me gustó especialmente el glosario del final, donde te explican aquellas palabras que necesitas saber pero que te dan muchísima información.Tengo pendiente una relectura previa a la nueva versión en cine, y le tengo muchas ganas.---------------------------
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
 Second reading  of this wonder of literature, and I liked it as much as the first. And with more baggage I have enjoyed certain things even more.This is the story of Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto and Lady Jessica, rulers of a planet appointed by the Emperor to settle on the planet Arrakis instead of the Harkonnen, who ruled it until now. During the first Book (this novel is divided into 3 books) we will see the palatial plots of these vile Harkonnen to destroy the house of the Atreides, while in the remaining two we will see the story evolve. Inhabiting the planet are the Fremen, a people who live in a very tribal way, who call the planet Dune, and who will be a force to be reckoned with.The book contains intrigues, adventures, philosophy, and some very well written characters. After the end there are a series of appendices that portray situations that occurred before the story, and a glossary with terminology of the Empire, which helps us to know more things than are mentioned in passing in the story.If once you have reached the end you want to leave it like that, it is perfectly feasible, because everything is well tied. But if you want to continue, there are more novels to continue reading. A must-read for any science fiction fan.First reading--Important note, the review I had made in the original reading has been deleted.--A gem of science fiction, one of the classics of the genre.It has a very well developed story with a few previous brushstrokes of information, where the conspiracy and the palace plots carry a large part of the book. Some characters that I liked a lot, that also have, to a greater or lesser extent, a development.I especially liked the glossary at the end, where they explain those words that you need to know but that give you a lot of information.I have a rereading pending before the new film version, and I'm looking forward to it."

But I really want to talk about this book so here goes nothing.Only time will tell i guess, but this might be a new all-time-favourite. I went into Dune expecting to enjoy it, but I didn't expect to be so swept up in this world and its characters. It's been a long time since a book was able to consume me (and my life) this much and on so many levels. It took me almost two weeks to read it but it was worth every second. There's so much to talk about that I don't quite know where to begin, and I'm sure I will forget a few things, but let's just go. One of the first things that surprised me was Frank Herbert's writing. I heard a lot of people say this was a very dense, dry and hard to get into novel. I would disagree on all of those aspects. I have seldom come across a novel so rich in beautiful, deep and meaningful quotes that really hit me. The themes Herbert discusses in Dune really resonated with me, which probably contributed to my enjoyment of his writing and how he used it to bring his messages across. I'm very much team pro-epigraphs. I LOVED them. Not only for the beautiful quotes but also for increasing the tension of the book. Someone may argue that Princess Irulan spoils certain aspects of the story within these epigraphs and thus takes the tension out of the book. I would argue the opposite, but that's just my personal experience with the story.Now, what I really love in SFF books is when the setting is almost its own character. And that is definitely the case in Dune. The ecology of Arrakis and the environment these characters live in make up a huge part of the story and I loved it.Though Frank Herbert does only offer a rather detached view of the characters, I did find myself rooting and caring for them a lot. I really enjoyed the mother-son-duo that was at the forefront throughout most of this book and the themes of parenthood and family that were therewith discussed. Lady Jessica is such an intriguing, strong and elegant character that I fell in love with pretty early on. I also really enjoyed Paul's character, although I did have some difficulties caring for him as a person later on in the book. That being said, I appreciate his character so much for what Frank Herbert does with it. I don't think I have ever followed a character quite like Paul before and I loved the themes that were explored through him, such as fear, destiny, manipulation and leadership (and what that actually entails). People call this book (or the movie) a white saviour story, and, to me, that discussion makes it pretty obvious who has actually read the source material and who hasn't. To me, this book is a critique of exactly that trope and opens up a LOT of discussion about culture, race and colonialism. But that's just my opinion. That's not to say that this is a perfect book. I found the reliance on fatphobia to paint the picture of a detestable villain quite outdated and unnecessary. While I think that Dune definitely stands the test of time in many aspects, the way women are treated in this universe could definitely be discussed further and I'm very curious to see these female characters we've come to love and care about develop even more in the upcoming instalments. Overall, I think this book is more relevant than ever and can 100% be enjoyed by modern audiences. The topic of environmentalism alone is such a huge part of this story, next to various other thought-provoking themes that I greatly enjoyed. Dune is so rich in social commentary, deep and fascinating concepts and human emotion. I have been looking for a book to really hit me for a while now, and I'm glad I found that book in Frank Herbert's Dune. I can't wait to continue with the sequels and probably reread this story many, many times."

En ningún momento se tiene la sensación de estar perdido o abrumado, dosifica y presenta muy bien la información. Engancha desde el primer momento y lo hace por dos motivos: el primero es que al principio nos atrapará con politiqueo del bueno: intrigas, traiciones, conspiraciones… y la segunda es porque todo el peso de la narración recae en los diálogos y monólogos internos de los personajes.Y este ritmo tan bueno en ningún momento decae durante el resto de la novela, poco a poco se sumarán el resto de ingredientes y podremos admirar en todo su esplendor la profundidad de esta historia y del mundo tan fascinante y rico que presenta.Además, uno puede quedarse en la superficie de este libro o intentar bucear un poco más y si es así descubrirá que de Dune subyacen muchas críticas: el peligro del fundamentalismo en todas sus vertientes, la importancia de la psicología en contraposición con el poder militar o la tecnología, el valor de la ecología…En definitiva, Dune es un libro absorbente y cautivador, de esos que merecen ser leídos."

The world, the characters, the language, the politics, the… everything! It can be overwhelming at times.The story sort of lost me a little as Book II rolled in. I was really enjoying the political intrigue of the first part (this book is split up into 3 parts), and felt it killed off a few of the more promising players. That being said: we’re basically told from the beginning much of the things to come, and there were dozens more characters that came into play for me to invest in. Paul is a great protagonist, but I was all-in on Lady Jessica. She is, without doubt, one of the coolest characters I’ve read in the genre (male, female or otherwise).This is book is a behemoth, and if you don’t give into it fully, you’re not going to enjoy yourself. Having seen the film from the 80’s decades ago, I kind of had a vague idea of where the plot was headed (from what I could remember), but this novel far surpassed all from David Lynch’s original film. I’m eager to see how the upcoming 2021 adaptation tackles the source material. It won’t be an easy feat, for this is a staggering undertaking. This book was far ahead of its time when published, and is a marvel; It was a catalyst for hard science fiction. Some would say it’s the father of all good Science Fiction. Frankly, I’d have to agree now that I’ve finally gotten through it myself."

Mood's a thing for cattle or making love or playing the baliset. It's not for fighting.My problems with Dune are not issues with speculation. My disbelief is maintained through healthy exercise. Much as I am opposed to terms like world-building I can empathize and imagine. Pondering alternatives is a heady philosophical endeavor. That said, I do not like the insistence on the epic in SF/F. What I want is a Month in The Country or a Stoner on some distant world. Maybe that is why Dhalgren and Embassytown hold such appeal. I read the first 300 pages in a rush. I noted that it was the cast of Hamlet involved in the Battle of Lepanto and deciding to stage a production of Othello. Along the way Ned Stark becomes a suicide bomber. Matters sort of went downhill from there. I didn’t pick up the book for a few weeks and then blew through the remaining 200 pages in two days. Lawrence of Arabia imbibes a magic elixir and becomes Harry Potter and the womenfolk just hope for the proper man, both in prophetic terms as well as totems of identity and fulfillment. Wooden dialogue muddied a clever use of stream-of-consciousness. Alejandro Jodorowsky was an ultimate influence on my reading. His unrealized cinematic adaptation was a superior vision to what was committed to paper by Herbert. Here's to my pledge that the inchoate will never be terraformed. "

I mean, it was written the year I was born in 1965 so it must be amazing! However, I never got into it enough to rate it 5 stars. I just don’t dish out the five very often. I did a read-along in November 2020 with some friends of @jobis89 during the pandemic lock downs and this time I decided to listen to the book on audiobook. Easily one of the best audiobook productions I have ever listened to! I freaking loved it! ❤️ So now - all the stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ for Dune. Duh (what was wrong with me). It’s a timeless Sci-Fi masterpiece. Obviously Lucas lifted many of his ideas for Star Wars from the great book of “Dune”, then simplified the content for a younger audience and their lower attention span. Which is absolutely fine cause I freaking geek out on my Star Wars like anyone else 😂! So, now it’s time to kick back and watch the original Dune movie tonight - And I can’t wait to see the remake to be released in 2021 (stupid Covid messed up the original release date). And ...... I have all of the Dune sequels to delve into for the first time as well. Muad-Dib! Muad-Dib, Muad-Dib! 🏜"

I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”Synopsis: Arrakis is a desert world inhabited by a mysterious people known as the Fremen, and it is also home to enormous sand-worms who live to protect Arrakis’ spice, an important resource to the Fremen and the galactic empire alike. Duke Leto Atreides, his son Paul, and the rest of their court leave the Atreides seat of Caladan, a beautiful, lush world, to rule over Arrakis. Where there is money and power, there is also scheming and betrayal. And among it all, a prophecy of a great leader for Arrakis. Thoughts: Wow. What an experience this was. It took me three tries to get started but this time it really pulled me in and didn’t let go. This was a buddy read with my girlfriend, so it took me longer to get through than something I loved this much usually would, but it was a great experience and we’re both itching to continue the series as well as re-read this. Suffice to say, this an all-time favorite for both us, which makes it a bit less shameful that we own five copies of it between us! “I never could bring myself to trust a traitor,” the Baron said. “Not even a traitor I created.”Dune is widely regarded to be the most influential sci-fi novel of all time, and it’s not hard to see why. Compelling characters, political intrigue, phenomenal world-building and fantastic prose to back it all up. And looking at it from a modern perspective, it’s not hard to see the other great works that it has influenced. Still, she found the thought unsettling that water was a major mark of wealth here.I think what really makes Dune special is the setting. Arrakis is an incredibly harsh planet, populated by a harsh people. It is a desert planet and as you might expect water is hard to come by. The lack of water is what has shaped the Fremen, their culture, and their technology. For me the most compelling part of this book came later, when there is more of a focus on the Fremen and what their way of life is like. Herbert did a great job of creating a fascinating, mysterious culture. “There’s a Bene Gesserit saying,” she said. “You have sayings for everything!” he protested. “You’ll like this one,” she said. “It goes: ‘Do not count a human dead until you’ve seen his body. And even then you can make a mistake.’”The other elements of world-building here are also excellent. Details on the empire outside of House Atreides and House Harkonnen (the rivals of the Atreides) are kept fairly light, but there is enough there to give a framework for the rivalry between the two core houses. Then you also have an organization called the Bene Gesserit who play a key role in the world Herbert has created. They’re a secretive society who try to bend and shape the will of key players in order to create the future they want. An offshoot of their organization is the Missionaria Imperativa, who go to other planets to sew prophecies and prepare the peoples on these planets to assist the Bene Gesserit in their future endeavors. They’re not a key part of the novel or anything, in fact they’re only mentioned a couple of times, but I found this idea fascinating. “But I thought Mentat training had to start during infancy and the subject couldn’t be told because it might inhibit the early….” He broke off, all his past circumstances coming to focus in one flashing computation. “I see,” he said.Paul Atreides is of course one of the most important parts of this novel. Much of Dune is spent with him as he grows more important to Arrakis. I have seen some people online call Paul a bit of a Mary Sue, however, I don’t really agree with this. Yes, Paul is incredibly powerful and he makes few mistakes, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It’s nice to read about flawed characters but it’s also nice to read about powerful characters working towards fulfilling ancient prophecies. And I also feel that Paul’s successes (and perhaps lack of failures) act as just one part of a larger story which is filled with as many losses as it is with victories. The road to victory is not free of blood.“Paradise on my right, Hell on my left, and the Angel of Death behind.”As for Herbert’s writing, I thought it was excellent. His prose is evocative but not hard to understand, and it doesn’t fall into purple prose at any points. There are a lot of new words introduced that can be quite overwhelming to begin with, but their meanings become clear with continued reading or context, and I think that they help to immerse the reader in the world of Dune. My only complaint with the book is that there is a fairly important event towards the end of the novel that maybe could have used an extra chapter or two, but other than that this was a near-perfect read, even the ending was incredible and I had been worried that it’d be difficult to finish neatly. They’ll call me…Muad’Dib, ‘The One Who Points the Way.’All-in-all, this was an incredibly special read, and it joins the very short list of books I’m excited to re-read. This is sci-fi at its best.P.S. A quick note on the Deluxe Edition Hardcover. This is without a doubt the nicest book I own and I think it’s well-worth the slightly higher price than a regular hardback. Beautiful art on the outside and inside of the dust jacket, “Fear is the mind-killer” embossed on the front cover and even concept art printed on the inside covers of the hardback itself. It’s absolutely gorgeous and I’m so happy to have it displayed on my bookshelf."
272,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120198641-la-crosse-county-library,Rating 4 out of 5,"Dune has sat on my TBR list for as long as I have been on Goodreads, but with the movie having recently come out, I figured it was time to read it. (I never go see a movie without first reading the book—one of my cardinal rules!) It’s considered a science fiction classic, but I wasn’t sure what I was getting into. I’m glad I gave the book a chance though, even if it was kind of a bumpy start for me reading-wise. (I confess I switched over to the audiobook and enjoyed that much better.)After reading it, I’m still not quite sure what it was that gave me trouble initially, because I ended up enjoying the story. I think part of it may be that Dune is a book that defies genres—a science fiction and fantasy adventure sprinkled with overwhelming religious and environmental themes and tossed in a potent blend of coming-of-age adventure, mysticism, and political intrigue that naturally breaks literary boundaries. I have never read anything like Dune but having read it I can see that familiar aspects of it live on in popular science fiction franchises today, such as Star Wars or—maybe—Game of Thrones.Besides not solidly resting in a neat little genre encapsulation, Dune gave me a bit of trouble because of some problematic stereotyping of desert-living nomadic tribes as “savages” and “uncivilized.” Then there was the whole messianic savior thing that almost turned me off to the whole story entirely. It stunk of colonialists coming in to save the uncivilized peoples of the desert planet of Arrakis (more popularly known as Dune). What ended up tipping the balance for me and made me keep going was the fantastic worldbuilding and the surprising depth of character development, especially that of our main protagonist, Paul Atreides. (You can tell the author is invested in the story, the world, the characters, and the culture, even if some parts get cringey.)House Atreides has been given control of Arrakis on order of the Padishah Emperor, the planet that provides the mysterious “spice mélange” that underpins their multi-planetary imperial society (although it’s not clear until later exactly how dependent that society is on the spice trade continuing). Was it just me, or did I see spice as a parallel to oil in our society? Spice enhances consciousness and grants their users an extended life.Anyways, Paul’s father, the Duke Leto Atreides, senses that not everything is as it seems, and develops significant trust issues (warranted, frankly) as he prepares Paul to take over as Duke Atreides if something happens to him. House Harkonnen, the previous noble family in control of Arrakis before the House Atreides, has been plotting and scheming with the emperor himself to dispatch of the troublesome Atreides line. The Lady Jessica, Paul’s mother, and even Paul himself start developing suspicions, with Paul having had snippets of visions of doom and treachery. Unfortunately, their efforts to save Leto are for naught. There is a joint Harkonnen-imperial operation that takes out Leto and sends Lady Jessica and Paul fleeing into the deadly desert, where the famed—and deadly—Arrakeen worms live and the ghosts of the desert, the Fremen, wait. Turns out that the Fremen are Paul and Jessica’s unlikely saviors, taking them in as one of their own. For there is a prophecy about a savior known as Muad’Dib that sees all things and will lead the Fremen to paradise. And of the Bene Gesserit mother—the Bene Gesserit are basically a society of all-women warriors, trained in the martial arts as well as verbal persuasion—that gives birth to Muad’Dib. There is a dream among the Fremen to terraform the desert planet into one that is more hospitable for life and with water freely flowing over its surface in great quantities. That is what is meant by ""paradise"" in the prophecy. Paul’s gifts of extensive consciousness, a sort of ability to see the past, present, and future (in murky snatches) means he takes over as leader of the Fremen easily as their Muad’Dib, while Lady Jessica becomes a powerful figure in her own right as the tribe’s Reverend Mother. (Think soothsayer or shaman.)Paul is determined to have his revenge against the Harkonnens, and with his and his mother firmly ensconced within the Fremen leadership, a deadly showdown looms that’s bigger than any side expects. Is the Fremen dream out of reach?Read it yourself to find out. You just may be surprised!-CoraFind this book and other titles within our catalog."
273,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2602702-christina-a-reader-of-fictions,Rating 2 out of 5,"Woo, I conquered the Dunes, crossed the sands without being eaten by a worm, and inhaled the aromatic spices of Arrakis. This is a victory, even if Dune turned out not to be my sort of science fiction. I know, I know, it's a classic and I'm meant to love it, and I'm an utter disappointment to my parents, who dearly love the early Dune books. Oh well, such is life, no? I can see why Dune is so popular, but, largely, it's just not the sort of book I can love, though I'm very glad to have read it, so thank you to Robbie for getting me to do so!Time and again, I've said that I am a character reader, and I'm sure I'll set many more times. Dune has many charms, but they are not of characterization. Most of the cast is just so focused on one thing at all times, on ruling or backstabbing or mothering or being a wife or whatever. They're largely not people of interests outside of what they need to survive. Everything is about the world building and the political landscape. This isn't a book of banter and bonding. If world building delights you even without strong characterization, by all means, come explore these sand dunes.At times, though, Dune did flirt with being a book I could like overall. The story of Paul Atreides doing a sort of Monte Cristo and rising up for vengeance with a whole bunch of power at his back is pretty awesome. The powers exhibited by Paul and the Bene Gesserit, women trained to have crazy fighting skills and more, are fascinating. I'm also curious about Arrakis and how this planet exists. How can a planet with so little water sustain life (by drinking their bodily fluids and those of others for one thing O_O)? What precisely is the spice and how does it relate to the worms?These elements that I liked, though, were bogged down in the political back and forth, the perspective hopping between those of the Atreides group and the antagonists. I just had no fucks to give about what the Harkonnens or the Emperor were doing. Paul so obviously has all the power in the world and has been fulfilling all of these prophecies to be the Kwisatz Haderach, whatever that really means, so it's not like he's going to be defeated. It's sort of like how Harry Potter obviously wasn't going to die in Rowling's series. It's hard to care about Paul when I know he won't be killed.Oh, though I'm not generally a big fan of characters being that powerful and perfect, I do like the way Herbert showed the difficulties of being Paul. He clearly struggles with the apartness of being so much more than everyone around him. The fact that he receives reverence rather than friendship further alienates him from the rest of humanity. This in turn makes it more likely that he will turn corrupt or unfeeling, as was oft hinted.What really held me back in Dune more than anything else was the writing. It's not a style I found pleasing. Herbert uses a close third person, which jumps about from character to character. On top of that, character's thoughts are in italics. For the most part, that's alright, but sometimes there were long paragraphs of fragmented thoughts separated by ellipses. Between each chapter, unmarked stretches of time pass, leaving me constantly disoriented when I pick the book back up. Little details are dealt with endlessly but the climax skips most of the fighting for more talking. So many people die in Dune, and yet there's so little actual action.Also worthy of note is that the treatment of women in the novel made me uncomfortable, as well as the treatment of the Fremen. Women can obviously be quite strong, stronger than the men, as the Bene Gesserit show. However, that's not a feminist move if these powerful women are essentially slaved, sold out as concubines to wealthy men. Plus, there's a weird message that being a concubine is actually better than a wife that I find really puzzling.The Fremen are the desert people of Arrakis, who know much better how to survive there, and rule the planet no matter what Duke claims to be the leader. They're way better fighters than anyone else, and they do get respect for that. Still, I find the fact that they need Paul, from outside their culture, to come in and rule them disgusting. It's like this is pro-colonization, and I am not a fan.That all came out quite ranty, but I really don't think Dune is a terrible book. It's not a great book for me, since I'm not all that interested in political intrigue or world building for its own sake. Dune's also very much a product of it's time. Glad to have read it so I know what the fuss is about, but I shan't be continuing on, which is probably for the best since I heard the series goes bad places."

It took me three tries to get past the first pages of Dune, but once I made it, a world as strange as it is fascinating (and not always very accessible) opened up to me.The story is set in a future where spice is a drug that enables people to extend their life span and gain superhuman abilities. The only planet where it can be found, is Arrakis. Understandably, the desert therefore becomes the location for political intrigue and power play. There's no easy way into the world of Dune. If you're unfamiliar with the plot, this is a tough nut to crack. Especially in early segments, you're confronted with a multitude of character, their thoughts, while Herbert doesn't bother explaining a lot of the concepts and mechanisms of the world he created, but let's you sort of read between the lines and figure it out for yourself. The characters aren't necessarily likeable, but it's more about the ideas they represent. We've got the classic Chosen One plot going on (even though this was obviously written before the term would make you roll your eyes), with Paul, the Duke's son and our protagonist, has to learn the Fremen's ways in order to survive the political plots that are plotted against his house. The Fremen are the planet's natives, the ones controlling the enormous sandworms and cherishing water above anything else, the one's knowing how to survive on this harsh and unforgiving desert planet and fanatically accepting Paul as their Messiah.The writing style was my biggest struggle with the novel. There's so much to unpack in this novel, but because Herbert isn't the most engaging and clear of writers, it sometimes gets hard to dig through the multiple layers of inner monologue and various points of views. It's just that I was so busy with navigating my way through his maze that I sometimes felt trapped in this world, unable to enjoy what was revealed. There are questions of religion and power, human control over biology and ecology and determinism. I suppose this really is one of those books that highly benefit from a re-read. We'll see.Edit in 2021: It's been a year and here I am back for said re-read! Funnily, my second read was way more enjoyable than the first. I think it helped so much to already be familiar with the characters and having the who's-who in place before embarking on this journey. I'm still torn on how much I can truly feel for these characters, as their way of over-analysing each other is still alienating. But I'm ready to carry on now!"

I wish I could say i was interested in the book because of its rave popularity but unofortunately no. The genre of Science Fiction is still unknown waters that I had not yet dipped my toes in. Until this.As I mentioned, I have never before read any Science Fiction and went into this novel quite blind. As a lover of fiction and recently LGBTQ+ translated novels, I was quite skeptical whether I will be truly be able to enjoy this. What I can say is I was pleasantly surprised. Before starting the book I did alot of research that I have never done before. For my part I watched many reveiws of Youtube, watched tutorials on the Dune universe, watched interveiws of Frank Hubert himself. I was once again surprised at how much I enjoyed those. Especially those interviews. There was something about the man himself, the facts that he mentioned all the way back in the 70's that were slwoly coming true in the present. There was something alluring in those. So I can say that something of the ratings I give here have to be thanks to that. One of the major complaints I heard about the novel was the writing. The constant jump from the perspectives within a chapter itself. There were many who were complaining on how the story seemed somehwat disjointed. Maybe it was due to my proper lack of knowledge in that particular area but for me this was not a problem. It was almost like a challenge and in a way it made the story much more interesting. We didn't have time to imagine about what others were thinking. The facts were given to us straight. There were a lot happening in the plot anyway so having time not lost on that was an advantage for me. Also the plot was constantly moving. I was absorbed into it like a puny human absorbed into the sands by the worms. Like I mentioned before, my expertise in this area is very lacking. Thus I won't go into details regarding this and embarss myself further. In the end I was somewhat left dazed. The climax happened at the end and quite quickly. All the moments before was just a prequel, a build up. In a way I felt the whole book was just a prequel and the story itself is just starting. I had a hard time getting my hands on this one so I know it will take long before I can finally read the second book but I will still be waiting for that day. Although my review itself seemed scattered, I do hope that people understood my standpoint in regards to the book. Ultimately I think this was a safe choice for me to enter the arena of Science Fiction and I would really love to read more on that. Till then, adios. "
276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63036279-trevor,Rating 5 out of 5,"The words ""epic"" and ""awesome"" get thrown around pretty liberally when describing our favorite media. Sometimes it is deserved. A lot of the time though, it's more hyperbole than truth.Dune is truly epic.As always with my reviews, I won't dig into the plot overly much. The formula is classic, but with enough twists and surprises to keep you engaged to the very end. The first third starts out a little slowly; there is much to absorb and understand. Although with characters that are so alive and real that you will wonder how in the heck Frank Herbert has such a keen understanding of the human mind, it hardly matters if it slows down a little. It's a splendidly immersive experience no matter what is happening.And the quotes! The wonderful wisdom packed into every sentence! A lot of them have pervaded our vocabulary and culture so much that I had heard or even said them before knowing they were from Dune. 
“If wishes were fishes, we'd all cast nets.”

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”

“It is so shocking to find out how many people do not believe that they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult.”
I could keep throwing amazing quotes out all day, but the point is made. This book is brilliant. It is a must read for anyone and everyone who likes Science Fiction. The amount of things it has helped inspire - from Star Wars to The Wheel of Time - is staggering. A lot of Science Fiction has trouble aging well. As technology and society advance, certain ideas or predictions seem silly or over the top and the characters don't hold up well to reality. Dune, however, is timeless. I never felt like I was reading something from a different era. It's ideas and social/political commentary are still very relevant over 50 years later. There's a reason it was one of the first epic Science Fiction novels to get published and be taken seriously. It is quite simply a stunning masterpiece - no hyperbole required."

Але чекаючи на запланований фільм Дені Вільньова, я вирішила таки поцікавитися й першоджерелом. І зараз я дійсно щаслива, що познайомилася з «Дюною» Френка Герберта, і що саме ця чудова книга дозволила змінити мою думку про жанр наукової фантастики. Падишах-Імператор забирає правління планетою Арракіс у Харконненів і віддає його герцогу Лето Атріду. Усі розуміють, що не в якості нагороди: по-перше, планета – це суцільна пустеля, яка кишить піщаними червами-потворами та має обмежені запаси води. А, по-друге, Харконнени вбивають герцога майже одразу після його приїзду на Арракіс, адже там зосереджені необмежені запаси прянощів – а хто має контроль над ними, має контроль над всесвітом. Світ Дюни прописаний напрочуд добре та детально, а завдяки додаткам та словнику термінів у кінці книги на всі питання, які могли залишитися знаходиться відповідь. Я жодного разу не сумнівалася в тих подіях, які відбуваються і уважно спостерігала за пригодами героїв. Крім цього, цікавою є побудова роману – ми з перших сторінок можемо дізнатися й ім’я зрадника, і що герцог Лето помре, і долю Пола, тобто інтриги майже немає, адже автор відразу розкриває всі карти, але при цьому сюжет настільки затягує і нудно ні разу під час читання не стає.  Мені було дуже цікаво спостерігати за змінами, які відбувалися з Полом Атрідом – з підлітка, який всіма силами противиться своїй долі, він перетворюється на того самого обраного, якого так довго намагалися вивести сестри Бене Ґессерит, з усіма супутніми наслідками. Надзвичайно приємним є й той факт, що Френк Герберт приділяє велику увагу у своїй книзі питанню екології.«Дюна» – чудова книга, шкода лише, що закінчилася, не дивлячись на мої намагання розтягнути читання)))"

I remember reading this in college and loving it, but hearing it read to me (over the course of 3 weeks and a self-isolated 21 hours) was mesmerizing. It was great to finally get the correct pronunciations, to practically immerse in a world that was half-remembered, like a dream with a lyrical narrative to add to the dream effect. This classic novel is important for its various themes of ecology, religious mysticism, and political intrigue. Dune is a slow burn, as it constructs the milieu in which political machinations are the norm. There is a religious tableau that forms the basic divide between prophecy and politics. The characters are memorable, and their motivations are generally clear, but sometimes muddled by the vicissitudes of daily existence and hidden agendas. Thematically overarching the entire book is the environmental concerns implicit in a planet of water scarcity, but rich in a universally desired spice. Brilliant book IMHO and I love that Herbert’s son is continuing the Dune epic."
279,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5175502-nimrod-daniel,Rating 4 out of 5,"Book 1 (Dune) – The first half was a bit slow, the second half was great – 4.5/5Book 2 (Muad'Dib) – Excellent – 5/5Book 3 (Prophet) – Starts pretty slowly than the other books. The first half was so-so (and a bit boring), and the second half was quite good – 4/5Total – 4.5/5 So what have we here? Very good world building, good characterization, plotting and writing. All in all, I enjoyed reading the book, but I wasn't awed or hooked by it (I haven't read a page this week til yesterday, thanks to the boring first half of book 3). It could have been more sophisticated, but unfortunately I haven't found the level of sophistication I had expected. That's why I think Dune has an unfulfilled potential."

After TWENTY years of wanting to read it but being overwhelmed by the sheer reputation and scope, I have FINALLY READ DUNE!!!!In a nutshell, Dune it is about a young man named Paul Atradies. Paul's father is a Duke and his mother is the Dukes Concubine Jessica who is a member of the bene gesserit, which is a group of women with weird powers and abilities to see the future. His mother has trained him in ways the bene gesserit, the way they fight and defend themselves, and use their special powers. He is brought to the planet Arrakis, otherwise known as ""Dune"" when his father Duke Leto is tasked by the Emperor to rule the desolate desert planet. Leto knows that the emperor is only sending him there because he sees him as a threat to his power and throne, and wants to somehow get rid of him but can't deny the appointment. The planet is is the only place in the universe where a substance called Spice Melange is found. Now this is where it starts to get interesting, the spice is an addictive substance that is found in the dunes of the planet, and is responsible for numerous things such as advancing the life span, and is required for interstellar travel. The bene gesserit use it to give them their powers. It is the most valuable substance in the universe but is also the most difficult to acquire, as the sand dunes are overrun with GIANT sand worms with rows of killer teeth. When the Duke and his family are attacked by a rival house Harokenns, Paul and his mother find themselves alone in the desert and are taken in by the planet's desert race the fremens. The fremens believe that Paul is the chosen one, who will bring water and life to the planet. I just wish that I had read this book at an earlier time of my life. I think it often depends on WHEN in your life you read a book, how you feel at the time determines if you think it is a ""masterpiece"" or just a good book. If I had read this back in my 20's when I was more open to the themes in the book and after something existential, perhaps I would have appreciated it more. Unfortunately, I didn't get it at that deeper level. Not to say I didn't thoroughly enjoy it, but I wouldn't class it as the best sci-fi book of all time. At least not yet. I admit that towards the end of the book I looked up some resoures on the internet. Because the book is so old and so loved, there are literally COUNTLESS resources available. I found youtube videos, podcasts, BOOKS, and websites that delve into the Dune universe and really helped me understand everything at a deeper level.That's the good thing about the Dune universe, you can go as deep as you like. You can skim along the surface, or you can spend more time and research a little and dive deep under the water and get immersed in it. I have always heard that Dune was quite a difficult book. And because it was written in the 60s I was expecting some aged book with difficult-to-follow language. It was by no means an easy book, but it was nowhere near as bad as I was imagining! And it felt like it could have been written today. That is one of the things that I love so much about sci-fi and fantasy. Because it is set only within the borders of the imagination, it can be set anywhere and any time. It doesn't age. Would I recommend Dune?It is definitely a book that you need to sit with after you read it and discuss it with other people. I am looking forward to reading the sequels and delving deeper into this universe. Although I really wish that I had read it when I was younger, I think a lot of the themes would have hit me deeper and I would have had so many more years to appreciate it!For more reviews check out my: YoutubeBlog Instagram Twitter  Facebook "
287,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1143969-julie,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was my first time rereading this book since I was a kid, and I remembered hardly anything of it, so it was a wonderful fresh return to a world whose imagery haunted me throughout various computer games (though I haven't seen the movie or mini-series). Because gosh, the worldbuilding. I'm marking this as ""non-western setting"" even though it's a completely fictional world, purely because Herbert's entire universe is so deliciously influenced by other non-Western cultures and spiritual systems, and the Fremen are essentially Arabic Bedouins, Navajo, and Jewish nomads mixed up all in one, and they kick all kinds of ass. From Brian Herbert's afterword:Among other things, the Dune universe is a spiritual melting pot, a far future in which religious beliefs have combined into interesting forms. Discerning readers will recognize Buddhism, Sufi Mysticism, and other Islamic belief systems, Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism, and Hinduism.I even devoured the lengthy appendices, because I am just so in love with this universe -- it takes some interesting material indeed for me to read, essentially, a dictionary cover-to-cover.As for the book itself: it's a classic and I'm now seeing/re-appreciating why, although it's much less sci-fi than one might expect, anchored far more in Shakespearean royalty coups, classical myth, fantasy 'Chosen One' tropes, and mysticism bordering on magic, especially considering the world of Dune is one where computers have been long-forbidden, thanks to what sounds like a failed A.I. uprising. (And can I just say that I love this, the way Herbert casually drops hints towards a deep history and significant past events but without beating you over the head with exposition? It leaves you with these tantalising glimpses and a craving to fill in the blanks. I also have a lot of A.I. feels generally -- COUGH MASS EFFECT GETH/QUARIANS COUGH)Everything is strangely organic, even down to computers having been replaced by ""human computers"" called Mentats. All of the worldbuilding details just feel grounded & accounted for & realistic, even as prophets see into the far-flung future and giant sandworms swallow factory crawlers.It's a world in which body language gives you away; complete mastery over reading other people's tics and twitches is one of your most potent weapons; words are power (the Bene Gesserit's wielding of the Voice also reminded me a bit of Max Barry's Lexicon); where political schemes incubate for literally hundreds of years before coming to fruition (seriously though, guys, the Bene Gesserit!). And the Fremen are just the coolest. The. Coolest.The middle part of the novel (Book II: Muad'Dib) dragged a lot for me, though, since Paul's 'awakening' and superpowers aren't very interesting to read about -- I was much more interested in what came before and after, and the blank spaces on the map. I mentioned this in comments, but the Baron Harkonnen is just such a moustache-twirling caricature of a villain, too; he serves his purpose, however, but I found his nephews (both of them!) and the Emperor more interesting as ambiguous figures. Lady Jessica is fantastic as a strong female character, and I'm happy to see such a powerful, loving mother/son relationship on the page.And it all leads to a crazy, wild, awesome climax -- but also with a far-sighted hint towards the future and things unseen, imparted through epistolary epigraphs and quotes from fictional textbooks, the historical analysis of the tumultuous events unfolding on the page. It makes me super stoked to read more books in the series, which I'm absolutely going to do (maybe this will be my big series conquest of 2015?).And apropos of nothing, let's all go admire Emily Carroll's Dune fanart."
288,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/978552-cathy,Rating 5 out of 5,"My third (?) re-read, I think, in anticipation of the new movie. I got the pretty deluxe edition for the occasion. I skimmed through the introduction by Brian Herbert and might get back to it, the bits that I did read where not uninteresting. The first quote of Princess Irulan‘s writings, on the first page of the actual story, immediately gave me goosebumps and took me straight to the beginning of the David Lynch movie and the sequence introducing Arrakis. Find and watch the trailer!I payed close attention to the quotations above each chapter. I also took much stronger note of the religious undertones of the book and the frequent use of Arabic words. My hardback edition has an extensive annex with a chapter on Dune‘s religious system, that gave context and opened my eyes to the different influences.I am amazed at the things I picked up this time around, that I had never noticed before. Lady Jessica‘s musings about her genealogy. Paul‘s Mentat training and abilities. I have absolutely no recollection of the conservatory. Or that they use ornithopters to get around. Guerney Halleck was a lot more interesting to me than before, as well as Thufir Hawat. I plan to continue reading the series this time and I am looking forward to Alia‘s development and how Jessica‘s story will progress.The implications of the Butlerian Jihad pretty much passed me by during my previous reads as well. Technological advances are by necessity quite imaginative and different from the expected. Another great chapter in this annex expands on the ecology of Arrakis and the impact of Kynes‘s father on the Fremen.Pain points of this novel: The book passes the Bechdel test, but women generally are concubines, submissive wives, a second row of characters. The only women with power are seen as witches, in the negative sense of the word. Baron Harkonnen is the only openly gay character and is a really repugnant piece of work. And Peter de Vries gets a derogatory description of being effeminate.I think we can assume that Herbert was very much a conservative, white male, firmly on one end of the Kinsey scale and the rest didn‘t exist as real options.+*+*+Review from my 2005 re-read:I read this book about 20 years ago and wanted to read it again, to re-freshen my memory of it. When I read this as a teenager, I found it a bit hard to understand, a bit tedious and not all that thrilling. For some reason I did read the next two in the series anyway. It was, after all, a fascinating setting - a desert planet, giant worms, a messiah, mysterious desert dwellers, space travel.....I came to really like the David Lynch movie. Recently I watched the new miniseries and that awakend my interest again.And this time around I liked the book a lot. It kept my interest the whole book through. The characters were well developed, the Fremen were mysterious, the bad guys were really bad and the development of Paul Atreides from young boy to jaded prophet is well done. The only draw-back: Scenes of the Dune movie kept intruding into my imagination.+*+*+Reading order:With Dune as the starting point:https://scifi.stackexchange.com/quest...Which would mean Paul of Dune before Dune Messiah.Purely chronological:https://www.howtoread.me/dune-reading..."
289,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45755125-raghav-bhatia,Rating 5 out of 5,"A writer who writes in his comfort zone and still retains his ambition in storytelling is a writer to be praised. Because, more often than not, when writers write what they're comfortable with, they tend to get lazy. And, less often {this} but frequent even so, when writers push themselves out of their comfort zones to explore new boundaries, the reader can feel their pen trembling behind the written word.Hence DUNE is an impressive achievement. Publishing houses today would be hard-pressed to put out an article like Dune. Frank Herbert wrote what he wanted to write, and he wrote it how he wanted to write it. He was clearly influenced by a lot of things -- Arabic culture being one of them -- and went to influence media that would dominate future pop-culture {*cough* Star Wars *cough*}. There's something refreshing about his openness when it comes to the subtle grandeur of vision. It's why I loved Susanna Clarke's PIRANESI. It's why I visit classics of this sort -- they've set rules for the modern storyteller, when they themselves sought to do their own thing.Herbert's imagination is brilliant. The tropes he employs may at times get reduced to rundown clichés but they're forever backed by passion. A character or two may be a caricature, but he will at least be an ornamental caricature. Dune is a great example of the classic ""hero's journey"" wherein other dramatis personae play their roles perfectly. White savourism? I doubt it, but could be there are things that was problematic in here (the villain's homosexuality is displayed in a subtly disturbing manner). The story feels simultaneously personal and remote, which could give some readers a bit of a whiplash when setpieces are switched. We're laid open to giant worms and alien customs, and intricate political and ecological and theological schemes, but mostly we're just following the characters doing their best on a sandy chessboard. Herbert's writing, which I've heard critiqued to death, is actually very competent. But yes -- we constantly jump between character's heads from sentence to sentence, internal monologues are used repeatedly as a form of exposition, and the reader is given more leverage than any of the eponymous characters. Either this works for you or it doesn't. The prose, contrary to what I'd been led to believe, is NOT antiquated. I was shocked to hear it labelled ""outdated"" when it is in fact modern archaic. I will, however, acknowledge a con: Herbert tries on occasion to be flowery but fails. He's not terribly descriptive, either: something I hadn't anticipated! He is spare with detail since there is too much detail to be spared. The focus instead is on character interactions, which works miraculously in the book's favor. We are spoonfed information. We are given much assistance so that we may weigh the author's predictions for our own. It's just that Herbert's style is largely SINGULAR, and honestly, I would not have it any other way because I wasn't in the least bothered by it and I just KNEW this was Herbert being TRUE to his conceptions — so what if he was trying to make things a little convenient for himself? He's not handholding because he's looking down on us, but get this: this is a science fiction novel from the '60s. It makes certain assumptions. It treats those assumptions as axioms, not entirely to the readers' benefit. And when your content is complex you present it simply so that the consumer may absorb it well. So that he may have a good time. I certainly did.I think EVERYBODY should try and read this. There's absolutely nothing to be intimidated by. If this isn't for you that's cool. If this is for you . . . well then, buy new seatbelts to strap in."
290,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad,Rating 5 out of 5,"Harkonnens, Corrinos, Atreides ... all are filth. Many would, of course, disagree with me, and put forth House Atreides as a shining beacon of honour and respectability, but on what is such an assessment based? Surely it is not because the Atreides abhor treachery because they don't ... they simply abhor certain sorts of treachery. Paul Muad'Dib is more than willing to treacherously twist words and manipulate situations and fire off atomics. Yes he follows his own ethical code -- thus eschewing poisons and Bene Gesserit words of power (occassionally) -- but that doesn't mean that he fights fairly, nor does it make him good and true (nor honourable and respectable). And this says nothing at all of his deep and utter ruthlessness (an inheritance from both his grandfathers).And Duke Leto's plan for the Fremen? It is the a perfect reflection of Shaddam IV's making of the Sardaukar -- the fierce fighting body that empowers the Emperor. Leto plans to mimic his cousin-Emperor's power, thus embracing the horrendous imperial game playing that enslaves and exploits and debases all those who live beneath the Imperium and the Guild. He is playing his role in the status quo. Nothing more.And what is it about Baron Harkonnen that makes him so despicable (he is, after all, seen as the most disgusting of villains in Dune? Neither his ambitions nor his tactics are really any worse than anyone else in the story. He uses the methods at his disposal, as do the others. Harkonnen's nastiness is his hedonism and perversion. It is because he is abhorrently gluttonous and is so fat he can only move using grav thrusters, and it is because he is gay (or possibly bi) and expresses leering interest in strong, hard, male bodies. This perception of Harkonnen says more about readers and our conceptions of evil than it says about Herbert's attitudes. If we are unable to see beyond the outward ""signs"" of depravity, then we are allowing ourselves to be blinded by appearances.I suppose I could go on to the other Imperial players: Lady Jessica, Count Rabban, Count Fenring, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, etc., etc., but there would be little point. It would be more of the same. A quick unlocking of why each of these people are equally dirty.How on Arrakis am I giving this story five stars, then? After my diatribe about the universal shittiness of the protagonists and antagonists? Simple. It is brilliant and brave of Howard to do what he's done here. It is the anti-Tolkien route to world-(universe)building. He doesn't coddle his readers with long exposition about what our perspective should be. He drops us into the action, surrounds us in the Imperial muck, leaves us to suffocate in the sand of Arrakis, expects us to make our own connections and find our own way with these characters, all while he simply puts the political machinations (murders and rapes and thefts and betrayals and greeds and genocides) of the ""great"" on display for us to witness.Dune is brilliant. It is the one truly epic piece of Sci-Fi literature and should rightfully sit comfortably alongside the greatest Sci-Fi novels ever written. I sure hope Denis Villeneuve gets the new screen adaptation of the book right, but if he doesn't I'll just come back and reread the book. Again."
291,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118385422-max,Rating 3 out of 5,"So, juhu, ich habe Dune gelesen!Die Geschichte hat mich grundsätzlich gut unterhalten und immer wieder weiterlesen lassen. Besonders mochte ich den dicken bösen Baron, die Sandwürmer und die ganzen coolen Gadgets rund um die Wüste. Auch in das Meer (schiefes Bild auf einem Wüstenplaneten...ups) an Motiv-Fäden, das Herbert erst allmählich entrollert und das bis in ferne Vergangenheiten verweist, bin ich gerne eingetaucht. Kein schlechtes Buch also.Die hohen Bewertungen für Dune kann ich nicht ganz nachvollziehen. Zunächst liegt das offenbar an meinem mittlerweile unüberwindbaren Desinteresse an Fantasy oder Sci-Fi. Gerne hätte ich so unvoreingenommen und festgetackert gelesen wie damals den Herrn der Ringe. (Damals bin ich eine Woche lang nicht in die Schule gegangen, um die drei Bände lesen zu können), aber tatsächlich fühlte sich Dune für mich passagenweise falsch an, irgendwie kindisch: Diese starken Krieger, die in Duellen um ihre Frauen fechten, die religiösen Tranceweisheiten des sackhaarlosen Pauls, diese Freundschaften, bei denen man füreinander ins Feuer klettern würde, dieses Gut-gegen-Böse-Ding etc. pp. Prinzipiell mochte ich zum Beispiel die eingestreuten Zweifel von Jessica an den Motiven ihres Helden-Sohnes. Letztlich ergibt sich aus diesen Zweifeln aber nichts. Da lässt das Buch dann psychologisch Sehnsüchtige verdursten. Jessicas Gattungsbezeichnung ""Bene-Gesserit"" ist aber wunderschön, wie ich finde. Klarer Pick für einen Mädchennamen! Ok, ich gestehe, dass hier eine gewisse Vor-Unlust herrscht, die ich gerne eliminiert hätte, aber immer nur momentweise ausstellen konnte.Aber auch die Sprache schwankte in meinen Augen zwischen:-guten, beschreibenden Passagen - etwa rund um die Sandwürmer, rund um das faszinierende Wasser-Thema oder während der Kämpfe.- ganz peinlichen Gedankenmonologen, die in allen Hirnen absolut gleich klingen und außerdem ganz unnötig sind, da man als Leser schon kapiert, was gerade los ist. Emotionen und komplexe Reflexionen der Figuren kann Herbert für meine Begriffe nicht schildern. Außerdem irritiert die Übersetzung mit Sätzen wie: ""...[ein starker Krieger] konnte sich nicht drehen, weil sich die WINZIGE Nadelspitze unter ihm IM BODEN verfangen hatte."" Mir ist voll klar, dass Herbert auch gute Sätze abliefert und dass jeder Autor manchmal im Detail schludert, aber hier fielen mir die ungelenken Formulierungen einige Male störend auf.Auch Herberts Bewertung der heimischen Bevölkerung (der Fremen) erscheint mir ambivalent. Einerseits werden sie von Anführer Paul in die Freiheit geführt und ihnen (und ihm) gehört ganz klar die Sympathie des Buchs. Ein heftiger Zynismus in Bezug auf die Bevölkerung lässt sich aber auch nicht leugnen. So äußert Paul, der weiß, dass viele unbeteiligte, unschuldige Fremen in den anstehenden Kämpfen sterben werden, dass sie nun zumindest erwacht seien und wüssten, wofür sie stürben. Diese Härte passt auch ganz gut zu irritierenden Aussagen über männliche und weibliche Lebensprinzipien, die sich im harten Geben respektive Nehmen erschöpfen...that`s what she said.Naja, sagen wir so: Ich wurde unterhalten und weiß nun, wovon geredet wird, bin aber auch froh, dass Paul und seine Mannen nun gewonnen haben. Und nun gucke ich den Film an."
292,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53069903-wick-welker,Rating 5 out of 5,"Despite the antiquated prose and clunky characterizations, Dune holds up very well with its world building, lore and mysticism.I finally got around to checking this classic off my list and I'm glad I did, because I now understand why this book is so celebrated. The world that Herbert creates is internally consistent, original, vivid and mysterious. In 600 pages, an interplanetary ecosystem focused on one desert planet blooms in the readers mind full of politics, treachery, indigenous people and mysticism. I was continually compelled to keep reading because I quickly became engrossed with the world. The story arc also kept me intrigued because there was plenty of foreshadowing placed that makes the reader know how the book is going to end. Somehow Herbert got this to work because I wanted to see how the plot would evolve to get to the forgone conclusion. It may have been anticlimactic but it doesn't mean I didn't enjoy getting there.The writing is very deadpan, devoid of humor. Herbert makes a very amateur mistake by crossing point of views within the same body of text. For example, on a single page the internal thoughts of up to 3 or 4 characters is revealed. This happens on almost every page of the book. If this were submitted today to an agent or publisher, they would ask that they completely re-edit the manuscript so that the POVs do not cross. It was quite frustrating as you lose track easily of he is doing the thinking and the feeling. Dune is steeped in mysticism. While I enjoy good lore, the mysticism was overdone because it became the excuse for every major plot development. Meaning, Herbert used mysticism as a plot device to explain away very important developments that really needed a better explanation. I personally enjoyed how the mysticism played out, but it is definitely a weakness of the work.The world is unbelievable. I loved being on Dune with these characters and that is why I'm giving it five stars. Herbert does an incredible job of writing this alien planet with its cultures, creatures, ecosystems and weather systems. It was awesome. The characters are developed but mostly through dialogue. This is not a hugely action driven story. Dune is a legend for a reason. Every sci fi fan should make this a must-read."

I just wanted to read it and see why it has become such a scifi staple and classic.I will say I was pleasantly surprised I didn't hate this book. The writing was definitely not to my taste, mainly because it is told in 3rd person omniscient. We see everyone's thoughts apart from their dialogue and it got annoying at times. The length, although insufferably long and could have been cut significantly, wasn't unexpected due to the nature of the setting. The worldbuilding also wasn't the best in my opinion, but that might just be because I'm not used to hard scifi. It just dumps a bunch of new cultures, religions, and terminologies with little explanation or history. Truth be told, I had no idea what was going on most of the time, but if I were to summarize my thoughts on this book into three words, it would be: weird, but interesting. What made me still like this book were a few key scenes which were actually pretty moving and thought-provoking. I also really liked learning about the Fremen and their culture."

The book centers around main character Paul Atreides and his family, who accepts control over the planet Arrakis-a desert planet and where the only source of melange is found. Melange is so coveted with its ability to enhance mental abilities and even prolong life, the Atreides family find themselves a serious target among other noble houses (particularly the Harkonnens). There is a lot going on in this book, but with a large cast of characters and full of action and adventure, it is well worth the read. Dune is highly recommend to fans of science-fiction, fantasy and adventure books. "
297,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116297579-lau-semi-hiatus,Rating 2 out of 5,"Dune is a sci-fi classic full of great ideas but questionable execution.First, I watched the film before reading the book, which is probably the reason why I liked the book and didn’t dnf it. The way the story is told, specially in the beginning, would have made everything too confusing to continue. There are scenes that needed more explanation, unnecessary paragraphs and repeated inner monologues of the characters that got tiresome. I understand repetition as a way to highlight an emotion, but if you do it all the time it loses its effect. There are important scenes which could have been written to show how crucial they were -as they did in the movie-, but you can miss them while reading because the author barely wasted a sentence in them. It was also curious the fact that there was barely any war scene, they were mostly off-page. You know someone is attacking and, next thing you read, they have lost and there is nothing to do other than run. However, my main problem were the characters. I cheated here and kept thinking about the characters in the movie, which I loved, because in the book most of them were poorly portrayed and lacking depth, which made connecting with them a challenge. The bright side are the sci-fi elements -original even sixty years later-, and all the different cultures, especially the Bene Gesserit. There aren’t a lot of descriptions, which at least makes the book quite easy to read after getting used to the poor writing. In short, I think Dune needed to be heavily edited in order to balance the masterfull ideas with the execution. I don’t know if I could recommend it. I liked it because I loved the movie and enjoyed knowing more details about Dune, but otherwise I don’t think I’d have endured the reading. Rating: 2.5/5"
298,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102468787-ian,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.9⭐It's been four decades plus since I first read Frank Herbert's sprawling, shambling, quasi-mystical, soap opera of a science fiction epic. Any review of Dune the novel now has to take into account Dune the phenomenon. Two movies, a miniseries and numerous prequels/sequels by Herbert and his inheritors have etched this tale into popular culture. Bottom line though; it's just a good story. Some main elements appear well rooted in western literary tradition, from King Arthur and Robin Hood (evil Barons!) to Greek mythology; others reflect Middle Eastern religious and political influences ( Islam and the Ottoman Empire). Re-reading the book made me realize how 60's it is and how it resonates with another science fiction classic of the time, Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land. That's certainly not to say the novel is dated, it just reflects the ambiance of the era in which it was written. My older self has more patience with and more appreciation of Herbert's dive into religous and cultural themes, embodied by the Freman ( where younger me just wanted to get back to killing Harkonnens). I don't see any point in recapping the now familiar plot but clearly Herbert's vivid descriptions of his settings and his characters have kept his tale fresh for 50 years. Bottom line though; it's just a good story."
299,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1027995-j-aleksandr-wootton,Rating 4 out of 5,"To describe the scope of story and setting as ""ambitious"" implies that the author was stretching or overreaching. So although it feels like an obvious word for the job, I won't use it on Dune, for the story and setting are as broad and deep and as apparently well-known to Herbert as Middle-Earth to Tolkien.Ambition belongs with us readers: first as those who would willfully plunge into Herbert's epic, second as those who would marvel at (or attempt to practice) the mind's potential to transcend merely-abstracted animal thought. Above all, this means the ability to accept news fraught with fear or hope, and yet deny them the power to cloud one's judgment.For in a universe such as Dune's, tense as a spiderweb with political powers and intrigues, mastery of mind is required to survive."

I might actually have to re-read the whole thing to truly form an opinion.Edit; 10 million years later - I still think I may need a reread of book 1 before I continue with the series to cement some elements further into my brain but looking back, this really, really did want to make me continue. I've also been oddly excited about the new movie coming out this whole time and now that I've finally seen (and loved it. Oof, Tim as Paul is pretty much exactly how I've envisioned him while reading), I keep thinking about the source material. All in all, I get why this is such a classic and it deserves the hype imho."

I immensely enjoyed the political aspects, and I hope there was more of that, because in the middle of the book the politics are quickly forgotten and a slooow burn starts. Which is good, but not great.The idea and the whole conecption of the story was extremely original for 1965. Overall, it was a really good read, a book that is clearly ahead of its time, but not of this current time. I felt it lacking in certain aspects; character and pacing."

El mundo que creó Herbert es único y maravilloso. Es increíble cómo este autor creo cada detalle sobre su universo, en especial todo lo que conlleva el vivir en Arrakis.

309,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28165536,Rating 5 out of 5,"DUNE intimidates me.I don't think I could ever recall a time that I became almost terrified to review a book and share my most intimate thoughts about reading it until now. I confess that I don't know anything about Dune until three years ago when I made the active decision to explore what the science fiction genre has to offer. I researched a lot of online lists regarding the most critically-acclaimed books and Dune was the one that keeps appearing all the time so I know that it must mean something so I ventured into buying it one afternoon in August last year when my laptop's battery charger quit on me suddenly, so I was offline for the rest of the day. And my world in that moment has never been the same since I started reading it. Everything about doing so was unplanned and it couldn't have been more perfect. Just seventy-four pages in and I knew I was reading something special already.The magnificence of the novel is often subtle yet clear-cut in an inexplicable manner that leaves me at loss for sufficient words; and I am one who always knows what to say when it comes to the literature I read. So far, I've read Flowers for Algernon, Childhood's End, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, The Shrinking Man, Ender's Game, and Speaker for the Dead, sci-fi wise, and all of these books have widened my perspective and weakened me in the knees because of their unanticipated emotional impact--but none of them can compare to the enigma and sheer elegance that Dune was. A few novels are intricately beautiful, able to scar you with a lasting impression and not only does Frank Herbert accomplish that; he also elevated the genre to me, personally, into a breadth and quality that makes the world of Dune so intimately familiar to readers regardless of the futuristic setting it was created in. Written in the sixties, futuristic doesn't truly reflect the scope of this novel. The locations may be set on a different planet (the desert planet Arrakis which is supposedly rich in spice melange) but the politics, economic divisions, diversity in culture, religious archetypes and superstition somewhat resemble ours--often in the most chilling sense. But what truly sets Dune apart from other science fiction books is the absence of artificial intelligence. There are no sentient machines here. There is only a human civilization from a thousand years from now, one that is not so different from what we have now, able to develop advanced technology as well as enhance the mental and physical skills that define humans as a species that continue to thrive and evolve, both as individual and society. The world and people Herbert have created are mostly Middle Eastern in concept and influence; a great number of the terminologies in descriptions, dialogue and characterization are Arabic. There are also Islamic overtones that populate the pages but to define Dune in those simplifications alone would be insufficient. There is a varied list of religions, as well as a comprehensive explanation regarding the political dynasties and technology of Herbert's creation. This is only the first novel of a timeless series that spans decades. It belongs to the subgenre of ""soft science fiction"" which usually focuses more on the social sciences (anthropology, political science, psychology) which for me is what makes Dune both less and more accessible to new readers. More often that not, when we think about science fiction, we think about AI and conflicts between humans and machines so if you're the kind of reader who enjoys these things in other mediums such as television and movies (I know I do), Dune may take some time to get used to. However, if you're one who can enjoy an expansive universe with sprawling family sagas and cultural nuances, then this book will persistently intrigue and ultimately hold you prisoner.It is a story of a mother and son foremost, and they are two of the most compelling characters in the book who readers will follow closely during their respective self-explorations and strenuous journey into the unexplored territories of the desert planet Arrakis. Lady Jessica is a Bene Gesserit (described as ""an exclusive sisterhood whose members train their bodies and minds through years of physical and mental conditioning to obtain superhuman powers and abilities that can seem magical to outsiders""). She is the concubine and beloved companion to the duke Leto Atreides and their son Paul was touched by a destiny that challenges the norms and comforts of the regime he is a part of. Paul and Jessica as characters and their relationship with each other remain as my favorite aspect of the story. In a sense, this book can be viewed as Paul's coming-of-age story as he slowly but surely accepts his role in spite of its overwhelming dangers and implications. No one in the book has undergone such a crucial transition than this main protagonist. Dune serves like play in three acts where the middle part is where Paul's endurance, identity and mental strength are tested and the very last act solidifies his accomplishment as the new leader of a world that is forced to keep up with him or else.I would assert that Lady Jessica is the most empowered and admirable female character I've ever read in fiction, and it's mostly because of her pragmatism, unshakable sense of self and autonomy, as well as her skills as a Bene Gesserit which for me shatters the conventions of how women (fiction and in real life) are usually perceived as emotional creatures with fickle passions and impulses. Lady Jessica stands above this, and always lets her head rule her heart but it does not make her frigid or callous. In fact, it has made her so endearing and easy to sympathize with especially whenever she makes decisions whose impact cannot be underestimated. She recognizes the power she has because of her training as a Bene Gesserit, and equips herself with it quite impressively and in service to the people she loves (like the duke and her son). However, the prejudice and negative bias towards her kind are still heavily highlighted. The Bene Gesserit are duped as ""witches"" because of the superstition that prevails among outsiders when viewing their craft from a distance. Men are always suspicious of her motives, always believing she is capable of the worst (and she is, but cautions herself against it). It's refreshing me for me as a queer woman to encounter a female character who doesn't weaponize her sexuality or deceive men for her own self-serving needs. Lady Jessica is far from perfect but she is poignantly humanized by her actions, thought processes and devotion and faith towards her son Paul. She's a remarkable specimen, that much is certain, who is wise enough to know that she can't know everything or give absolute guarantees about the things she does know.Paul and Jessica may take the center stage but other characters, supporting allies and villains alike, are just as well-rounded and memorable. I personally adored Kynes, Chani, Stilgar, Galleck Hurney and the elusive Princess Irulan who opens each chapter with excepts from her writings which set their tone. These short excerpts are reflective, often taken from various teachings and commentaries regarding science and spirituality as well as cultural analyses that the princess herself has taken a valued interest and investment in. She is only later introduced as a character by the ending chapters of the novel but her pieces throughout the book have served as narration devices which are consistently atmospheric and insightful.I would like to recommend Dune to everyone I know but I also recognize how challenging this work of fiction could be. This is not something you can pick up casually. It is the kind of book that is meant to be savored. I find that re-reading it again right after finishing it has even heightened my understanding and appreciation. The truth for the matter is the minute you start reading the first five chapters of the book, you are transported directly into the events without any kind of backstory. You just have to find your way from there and it can get confounding at times but it's also very exhilarating because the world of Dune slowly unfolds before your eyes in a small manner first (with the Atreides household moving to the Arrakis planet largely inhabited by the Fremen) until it sets up the wider stage later on. One of the most beguiling plotlines of the story is the Fremen as a desert society, and the spice melange as the source of their livelihood which is also a substance considered to be most important if not profitable. It certainly reminds me of the Spanish and Portuguese expeditions back in the day that we studied Philippine history in school, where they explored the continents to establish colonies and to look for spices (which eventually led them to my country in the first place). There are discussions about economics regarding the spice being harvested in Arrakis, as well as the cultural practices of Fremen when it comes to water, a substance they consider very much a scarcity so acquiring and preserving it involves a set of bizarre rituals.Dune is a classic for many reasons. There is just so much to consume and digest here that will not always be readily accessible so multiple readings of the entire novel itself is something I highly suggest. It gets better every time you willingly emerge yourself with the people and cultures within its pages. It took me two months to finish the first two parts. I then stopped for four months and picked this up again just last December. Its magnetic hold on me never loosened even during such a hiatus. I don't think I can compare Dune to anything else (though some could draw comparisons with a series from another genre, J. R. R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings). In that sense, just like LOTR, Dune does stand as a testament of its own making and legacy. DUNE fucking intimidates me. But I nonetheless love Dune with all my mind and spirit, heart and soul.RECOMMENDED: 10/10DO READ MY REVIEWS IN"

 4.5 StarsDune has long been a book that has attracted my attention, even before I realised it. When I was seven years old I learned to read with the aid of The Chronicles of Narnia and shortly afterwards The Hobbit. These fantasy novels inspired a love of reading and also a love of wonderful worlds and adventures, a love which was further fostered when at around the same age my parents introduced me to Star Wars. Such a science fiction concept with its space battles, heroic moments and general operatic drama thrilled me to no end. At the time I had no clue that one of the major sources of inspiration for Star Wars had been Frank Herbert's Dune.So, years later I began to hunt out the inspirational science fiction works which inspired George Lucas in writing Star Wars. Which led me to a bunch of other good and not-so good books and films. Finally I came to Dune, perhaps the biggest inspiration in terms of the mix of science fiction and fantasy elements visible in Star Wars. Unfortunately I wasn't as wowed by Dune as I hoped to be. There are fantastically wonderful science fiction ideas in the novel, but they seemed to be clustered and packed around a looser story than I like. In other words it was a novel that was slightly cluttered, for it is true that too much of a good thing can become a bad thing. I guess what I am saying is that I cannot deny the influence Dune has had on the genre as a novel but it's not one of the best novels I have read. It's often rated as the most powerful science fiction novel of all time, alongside Asimov's Foundation. But what I found is that a mixture of things did not quite make the perfect novel for me such as Frank Herbert's philosophical meanderings, the slower pace and as mentioned the additional clutter.However, rather than talk on and on about what I disliked, let me talk about what I loved. Firstly I loved how Dune is essentially a novel all about one man, Paul Atreides, growing into his mystical destiny and becoming one of the natives of Arrakis or Dune. It was certainly one of the finer stories I have read about a man learning from the native tribes and becoming one of them - a story trope often copied by lesser world creators nowadays. I loved the extensive worldbuilding - the spice, the sandworms (makers), the technology, the drugs and the royal politics. I also loved the character of Paul himself, tortured and twisted as he was, he possessed a degree of depth.I have to talk about what I disliked to a small degree though. I particularly disliked how the female characters existed in this world: either as scheming manipulators or as part of a harem, women there to look good. I also did not like the characterisation of the Baron Harkonnen and can only wonder whether Robert Jordan may have based many of his own characterisations on those presented by Frank Herbert. Because some of his weaker characterisations are remarkably similar to those seen here in Dune.All in all I did strongly appreciate Dune, I just had the slightest of reservations about it in the end. And these reservations are what prevent me from pouring out my full love upon it. When everything is said it stands as a must read science fiction novel, for its influence and for what it is as a novel. For it is a brilliant mix of ideas, just not always ideas that are delivered 100 percent wonderfully."

Tenho certeza que vocês ficarão com muita vontade de ler!Quando uma teia de conspirações atinge a família Atreides, todos ao redor são afetados. Após mudarem-se para Arrakis, o planeta-deserto, por decisão imperial, os Atreides sofrem um poderoso golpe e são obrigados a fugir para salvar suas vidas, sem antes sofrer pela morte de um dos seus. É nessa hora que Paul Atreides, o protagonista dessa história, descobre que faz parte de um plano milenar organizado pelas Bene Gesserit, uma antiga irmandade da qual sua mãe Jessica faz parte.Ao acompanharmos o destino de Paul, o planeta Arrakis e sua paisagem árida começam a tomar forma diante dos nossos olhos. Ao mesmo tempo em que sofre de escassez de recursos naturais, o Planeta Deserto é o único fornecedor de mélange, a especiaria mais desejada do universo.Prepare-se também para dar de cara com os temidos vermes-de-areia, criaturas gigantescas que fazem parte de Duna e serão importantes no decorrer da trama. Fique de olhos bem abertos.Além de focar bastante na forma de utilização e aproveitamento dos recursos naturais, durante a leitura nos damos conta de que a religião é um fator imprescindível para o avanço da trama.E quando religião e política se encontram, é treta na certa. Dá para perceber logo de cara lendo-se as epígrafes de cada capítulo, onde acontecimentos futuros são apresentados e já vamos tendo uma breve noção de onde a obra vai parar. Eu confesso que até tinha achado isso bem estranho no começo, mas o autor parece que vai levando o leitor de ponto a ponto na narrativa de uma maneira tão perfeita e concisa que a gente nem se incomoda muito com esses ""spoilers"" repentinos. A narrativa é muito boa, bem cadenciada, com momentos onde temos visões do futuro que está por vir e mesmo assim queremos saber exatamente como as coisas se desenrolam para chegarmos naquele ponto. É como se o autor chegasse pra ti e dissesse: “Olha só, isso aqui vai acontecer em breve, bem desse jeito, mas espera só um pouquinho, senta ali no sofá que eu vou te contar a história por trás de tudo isso, você vai gostar”. É algo bem dinâmico e que eu curti bastante.Em Arrakis também vive o povo fremen, do qual que eu pretendo falar mais nas resenhas seguintes. Só saibam que eles acolham Paul e criam uma relação estreita com a família Atreides. Passando um pouco para o lado rival dos Atreides, temos os Harkonnen. Preparem-se para uma boa dose de raiva e ""tramas por trás de tramas"" no meio dos conflitos entre eles.Duna é, sem sombra de dúvidas, um livro que parece manter-se firme ao longo dos tempos. No decorrer das suas quase 600 páginas, pareceu-me que o livro não havia sido escrito no século passado, e sim alguns anos atrás, até mesmo hoje, tal é a maneira com que são abordados alguns dos assuntos atuais e de problemática mundial (escassez de recursos naturas, religião e política).Toda a cultura do povo fremen, o incrível e perigoso planeta de Arrakis, as intrigas políticas de cada capítulo, tudo foi muito bem desenvolvido e deixa o leitor com vontade de saber o que acontecerá nas páginas seguintes. Com certeza lerei os próximos livros da série Duna!"

Eccomi qui, a recensire questa pietra miliare della fantascienza.Nonostante la presenza di una forma semplice di magia, Dune si colloca in pieno nel genere sci-fi: la scienza e le spiegazioni razionali prevalgono lungo tutto il romanzo, nonostante la forte componente messianica che circonda il carismatico protagonista, Paul Atreides.Punto di forza del romanzo è il world building: Frank Herbert non crea solo una storia, ma crea in primis un mondo, il pianeta Arrakis, del quale descrive con minuzia l'economia, la politica, le tradizioni, le credenze religiose. Come se non bastasse, lo colloca in un sistema più complesso, un impero galattico che subisce l'influenza di una associazione economica che fa valere i propri interessi.Il protagonista è nobile, è dotato di poteri soprannaturali sin dal primo capitolo, è freddo. Impossibile identificarsi con lui, eppure Herbert con perizia riesce ad indagare la sua psicologia in modo da renderlo interessante al lettore.Difetto maggiore: nonostante i singoli capitoli siano lenti, carichi di dettagli (personalmente ho adorato lo stile di scrittura), l'ultima parte del libro presenta troppe ellissi tra un capitolo e l'altro che rendono la lettura un susseguirsi di flash distanti temporalmente tra loro."

I am happy to say that I have made good on my promise. Without them, I would never have picked this up to read. It is quintessential science fiction and I’m sure you would find this book at the top of many sci-fi lovers’ top 10 lists. I started in on chapter 1 with a surprise because I expected a dense world-building to commence. I was pleasantly surprised, telling my husband so, to find that the characters were up-front from the start. The story begins introducing readers to the main characters right away and lets you know to settle in for a while and get to know this complicated and intricate scheme happening in this new world. I am in no position to recreate for you the storyline or to introduce you to all of the main players in this desert planet of Arrakis called Dune. So many well-versed people have written reviews that outline the people, events, and connections. So I will not even try to do that here. Being no sci-fi expert, I have a limited background of reading to pull from to compare with. And maybe that is not the best approach here, comparing Dune to books such as Ender’s Game or The Red Rising series which I have read and enjoyed very much. I understand that Dune has shaped this genre and inspired many writers, so its legacy is far-reaching. But that’s not to say that I can’t prefer one over the other or have strong feelings one way or another for the science fiction books I have read. Dune is immensely popular and for good reason. It is a mammoth of a novel and trails a series of 8 books for those who cannot get enough. Arrakis is a desert and water is of utmost importance. It’s a place where a human’s bodily water is extremely valuable. The Fremen are a desert group who mine the Spice, a drug that is found in everything, and they live on every bit of moisture they can find even to the point of extracting it from one who has died. The Spice is connected to the enormous sandworms that are worshiped by the Fremen. These creatures live in the areas where the Spice is harvested and they are extremely aggressive.As for Paul Atreides, I didn’t love him or hate him. He was set up as the One they are waiting for, a living legend or messiah who grows in power. This is a well-used trope in many stories still today. Stories abound about a man who will become something more than a man – that tends to a religious power as well as a political leader. These ideas surround Paul’s internal conflicts.My biggest issue was with the time jumps. I felt as though there were lots glossed over and we didn’t get to see Paul’s full growth from a young man of 15 where he makes his first kill to an older seasoned fighter. And surprisingly, Dune is not a book where you will expect to read about the battles. Internal conflicts, environmental issues and political clashes are more the focus. I am happy to have read Dune and plan to make this my only stop on this sci-fi trail."

Мешанина банальностей из всей мифологии, что попалась автору под руку, основы техник медитации да рудиментарный макьявеллизм. Написано как-то совсем не искрометно, да и художественных достоинств тут никаких - все то и дело take a sighing breath. Плоский безыскусный язык, изобилующий языковыми клише, без стилистических красот. Необъяснимое и ничем не оправданное проникновение вездессущего автора в головы случайных персонажей вызывает дополнительное недоумение. Хотя впоследствии становится более понятно, что многие ходы и мотивации здесь построены попросту на модели психического.Здесь она - основа разведки и контрразведки, т.е. все герои почти без исключений - штирлицы, а главный наш разыгрывает известный трюк ""Баба-Яга в тылу у врага"": чтобы обезглавить что-то, нужно его возглавить. Кстати сказать, причины для пресловутого ""джихада"" и предпосылки его так и остаются не весьма ясны, так что есть подозрение, что ""джихад"", да и весь мессианский комплекс существуют лишь в отдельно взятой голове неуравновешенного подростка, которого сослали на нелюбимую дачу, откуда нет возврата в город к друзьям и ""настоящей жизни"". См. творчество писателя Крапивина.Исполнено все это не сказать что очень искусно - в общем, не ""Горменгаст"". Да и многие разговоры достаточно бессвязны и больше всего напоминают диалоги картонных марионеток в кукольном театре, не говоря уже про само действие и дыры в оном (действие тут тоже очень похоже на Панча и Джуди - часто согласно принципу ""дальше не придумали, импровизируем"", а еще лучше - ""замнем для ясности"").Если б не условные приключения, которые начинается примерно только с сотой страницы (хотя не покидает ощущение упущенного карнавала, конечно, потому что все самое интересное происходит как раз за кадром, и нам об этом только кто-нибудь рассказывает), было б совсем уныло, как уныл любой соцреалистический политико-производственный роман. А это, по сути, и есть соцреализм - только с феодально-космическим антуражем, духом лоренсианского ориентализма да наркотической культурой конца 50х, когда она еще была в новиночку. Тут не пойми как ""кинджялы"" монтируются с космическими пепелацами, экологическими скафандрами, лазерными пушками и силовыми полями.Мало того, тут у нас еще и орден убер-феминисток, способных усилием воли преобразовывать в своем теле химические элементы, с его евгенической селекционной программой, рассчитанной на десятки тысяч лет и отдающей человеконенавистничеством, - а все это мичуринство ради того, чтобы вывести мужика, способного телепортироваться и читать мысли на расстоянии... Ну и кроме того, геоморфизм, ползучий колониализм и худшее прогрессорство середины 20 века с поворотом сибирских рек так и прет из всех щелей. А феодализм для этого - самая, как известно, унавоженная почва. В этом смысле даже ""наша-раша"" из него до сих пор не выкарабкалась.Арабика, кстати, тоже довольно-таки раздражает, но это уже - наведенное временем, автор в этом не виноват. В его время у всего ""под зеленым знаменем корана"" еще имелся какой-то романтический флер, ковры-самолеты убийц возникли несколько позже. Хотя санкционированное многоженство могло вполне привлекать и автора, и первых читателей.К 200 странице из 800 с гаком роман плавно перетекает в череду редакционных статей о разумной экологии, что само по себе мило и прогрессивно, однако едва ли имеет отношение к литературе - как и борьба за повышение надоев или нормы выработки стального проката. Редакционные статьи (которыми, в общем, можно было и ограничиться, потому что они автору явно удаются лучше всего... хотя как лучше: возникает ощущение, что читаешь про каких-нибудь ""подводных хлеборобов"" - тут тебе и беспримесный Беляев, и Ефремов, и даже Казанцев) перемежаются этими самыми, не весьма убедительными приключениями, а приложение посвящено только им, включая изложение довольно дремучей религиозной ахинеи. Не обращать на все это внимание трудновато, хотя если очень захотеть, текст даже может, в общем, развлекать. Наверное. Поглядим, конечно, что будет в шестилогии дальше - не уверен, правда, что меня хватит на фанфики, сиквелы, приквелы и вбоквелы. Но до чего же неблагодарная это работа - такое экранизировать....В доме после слияния библиотек также оказался перевод некоего Вязникова, который я читать не стал, конечно, - уж очень скверно и по-советски он сделан даже для 1991 года издания (там переводчик старается всячески улучшить автора пресловутыми ""улыбками Боромира""). А вот послесловие его прочел. В нем Вязников превозносит Очень Сложный язык и Очень Изысканный стиль ""Герберта"" (да, он подчеркнуто считает, что только так и должна выглядеть ""паруску"" его фамилия), роман явно полагает непревзойденным шедевром и образцом чего-то там, что выдает в нем, конечно, человека, очень хорошо разбирающегося в вопросе, и ругает всех переводчиков (не только этого романа, а вообще), кроме себя, похваляясь тем, с какой доблестью сдал в издательство Рукопись (даже не машинопись). Токсичная запальчивость, с какой он оттаптывается на заведомо дрянных потугах своих предтеч, выдает в авторе крайне мало опыта, и остается только пожелать, чтоб хотя бы толику энергии этой пламенной риторики он употребил на совершенствование собственного текста. Поскольку, разумеется, его варианты зачастую мало чем лучше того, над чем он насмехается. Почему ему, кстати, не пришло в голову, что Дюна должна быть Барханом, я решительно не понимаю. ...а, ну да: у него ж и главный герой - Пауль."

(این یکی از مهمترین جذابیت های کتاب بود) یا اشاره هاش به مفاهیم اسلامی مثل جهاد. حس میکنم خوندن رو برای مخاطب غیرآشنا به این چیزا سخت کرده بود. ولی ما حداقل اینو اوکی هستیم :))) فضاسازی خفنترین و بهترین چیز کتاب فضاسازی بود. همش خودمو تو اون فضا میدیدم. اینکه لباس های فریمن ها رو پویشدم و توی شن ها به صورت نامنظم راه میرم :)) از اون کرم شنی میاد با هم خوش و بشی میکنیم :)) در کل اکوسیستم ارکیس واقعا خفنه. همه چیز حساب شده و جالبه.از طرفی من کتاب رو صوتی هم گوش میدادم. یه بک گراند موزیکی با صدای باد توی کویر بود. توصیف های طلوع آفتاب و ... واقعا دیوانه کننده بود. از طرفی کل ایده طریقه زندگی همین فریمن ها و بقیه چیزا خیلی جالب بود.خیلی حس میکردم مثلا استاروارز چقدر ایده گرفته. خصوصا برای Tatooine  داستان اصلی Paul , Harkonnen واقعیتش این قسمتش بدترین قسمت کتاب بود. هرچقدر روایت‌های محیطی قشنگ بود یا مثلا بعضی چیزا توضیح داده نمیشد اینا برعکس بعضی جاها اینقدر تکرار میشد که دیگه خسته میشدم. بحث های سیاسی و ... در کل خط اصلی داستان منو نگرفت. ایده اش قشنگ بود... حرفای قشنگی هم زده شد تو داستان. دوست داشتم در کل ولی نه به عنوان چیزی که زندگیمو عوض کنه یا بزنم تو سرم که وای چه چیز خفنیه. مثلا سری اندرز گیم. واقعا طرف حرف داشت بزنه. اینجا اینقدر حسش نکردم.یه جاهایی شخصیت‌ها اینطوری بودن. یوهاها بریم به این خیانت کنیم. یا یوهاها نریم. یا فلان. خیلی این چیزا بد بود. شخصیت سازی در کل خوب نبود به نظرم...من در جایی نیستم که همچین نظری بدم. ولی حسم این بود که نویسنده چندتا سفر رفته کشور کویری عربی. مثل مصر یا عربستان. بعد یه موادی هم زده :)))) بعد ارکیس و ... به ذهنش رسیده که بنویسه. بعدا براش یه داستان جور کرده ... (هدف بی ارزش کردن کار نیست. میخوام بگم بیشتر فضا سازی اول اومده و بعدش روش داستان نوشته شده. حداقل حس من اینه)البته اینا شاید از خامی منه. نمیدونم. همه میگن بار دوم بخونی بهتر دستت میاد. بازم نیاز هست هم درباره اش بخونم هم ببینم حاضرم اینو دوباره بخونم؟ یا برم جلد دومیه سری تحلیل هم درباره زیرساخت‌های کتاب هست که مثلا ادویه تو جامعه واقعی چیه. یا خرافات چقدر برای حکومت داری لازمه. یه رهبر هم میتونه اشتباه کنه و نباید چون اون میگه حتما پذیرفتش و ... اینا خیلی چیزای مهمی هستند که من دقیق نمیتونم بگم خوب فهمیدمشون. و میدونم که نیاز هست بیشتر نقد و ... بخونم. اگه چیزی فهمیدم که اسپویل فری بود حتما میگم. جمع بندی خوندن کتاب توصیه میشه ولی نه مثل بعضی کتابا که بگم نخوندید الان آب دستتونه برید بخونید. در کل خوش گذشت. قسمتایی که منو جذب کرد همین فضا سازیش بود و از طرفی مگه چندتا کتاب هست که درباره مهدی و لسان الغیب و این چیزا تو فضای تخیلی حرف بزنه؟"
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109743598-uhtred,Rating 2 out of 5,"No. I've tried, wow if I've tried, but nothing, this kind of books can't get me excited or involved. Yet I really like science fiction books, I devour those of Crichton and Verne, where science plays a large part in the fiction. These, instead, where fiction represents almost everything, I do not like. They seem to me books written for children, by authors who have given free rein to their imagination. Which is more than legitimate, of course, but that's not for me. Even if in the end this book (of which I will certainly not read the 5 that follow it) forced me a bit to reflect on what science fiction is, on what makes one say that a book belongs to the science fiction genre: fantasy and science for sure, an environment out of the ordinary, characters out of the normal, physical phenomena out of the normal and of course the things that happen, which must also be out of the ordinary. But, for me, it must be an ""out of the ordinary"" understood as ""currently non-existent"", but with something probable, at least conceivable. It must be a science that, pushed to the limit, leads to the ""currently” impossible. So there must be solid scientific foundations, otherwise the book becomes Fantasy, and then we are in another field (which I don't like). If I read a science fiction book, I always want to feel connected to something scientific, otherwise everything is possible, even non-logical things, and then after a while boredom sets in. And that's what happened with this book, which by the way is also very long. It is clear that the reason why I put two stars is because this book is sold as a cornerstone of science fiction while instead it is a Fantasy, so expectations are frustrated. We are on other planets, in the future, there are strange objects and strange peoples, but then in certain moments it seems to witness to Beautiful or to King Arthur, with Counts, Dukes and swords (laser). Furthermore, the writing style is rather heavy and disjointed, but perhaps it is the quality of the translation, I don't know: the fact is that the pages are unnecessarily tiring to read and sometimes one laughs at the choice of certain names. Well…Frankly I don't know how to explain why this book has become so famous and praised; the characters are certainly not unforgettable, the adventures are certainly not amazing, the settings are certainly not unforgettable; I am perplexed. Maybe in 1965, when this book came out, it had something groundbreaking (maybe). But reading it today is truly disappointing: the story is slow, cumbersome, banal and predictable. And if one has a lot of expectations because he has read hundreds of enthusiastic reviews, the disappointment is even more burning, since he expects a lot of things and then nothing happens ... Maximum respect for an author who has been able to be loved by millions of readers, but I remain of my idea. Two stars."
324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22024209-maja-ingrid,Rating 3 out of 5,"Well, there. I’ve read it. Was it a great book of its time and an oh so important influence? Maybe. Certainly. But I’m not going to give it 5 stars because it paved the ground for modern science fiction. I will acknowledge it and thank it. But other than that, it’s still a 3 star read. Some stuff in it holds up, some doesn't. There was some speedreading being done, becaue I wanted to make sure I finished the book before I saw the movie. Lousy planning on my part, should have started the book sooner so I’d had more time to read it. But oh well. Also, some parts kinda bored me so I wanted to be done with them and skimmed a teeny weeny bit. The book had a few moments that were awe-striking and which I felt “I should like this book more than I’m doing.” Maybe I had enjoyed it more if I had given myself the time to actually immerse myself deeper into it. Or maybe a lack of “deadline” would have me read it too slow and then grow bored to the point of DNF. Had I read this book while still in my teens, I might have enjoyed this book a lot, and grown a strong nostalgic bond to it, such as I’ve done to the first handful of fantasy authors I read as a teen. I’m not a huge sci-fi fan when it comes to books. I much prefer my sci-fi as movies or tv-shows. So, I knew from the beginning this was very unlikely to be a gushing 5 star review, tops a 4. And settling on a solid 3 is not a surprise really. It wasn’t terrible and it wasn’t great. Kind of grew to like Paul less over the span of the book. I didn’t really like the way his character developed. To be honest I did not care for any of the characters. They felt distant and were difficult to connect to, despite being inside their heads and hearing all their thoughts. I could never really get a grip of them. And I don’t like POV changes without proper paragraph or chapter breaks. And no, Dune did not do it better than any other heathen book who change POV’s without proper breaks. World-building was pretty good though. Plot was kind of bland. Which could have been great. It’s a coming-of-age story and a chosen one story of Paul. Both tropes I enjoy a lot because they are very grateful tropes to use for plot and character development. It’s also this rivalry between two houses, also a fun trope. A fight over a planet because of a drug? Duh. There’s also quite a few themes being explored. It should have been great and it wasn’t. Let’s hope the movie is better than this. Have no interest in the rest of the series. This stands good enough on its own in my opinion. "

Με γοήτευσε, με ταξίδεψε, με μάγεψε, με ενθουσίασε. Είναι ένα φανταστικό δείγμα Επιστημονικής Φαντασίας (βασικά περισσότερο μείγμα Space Opera και Λογοτεχνίας του Φανταστικού θα το χαρακτήριζα). Αν εξαιρέσει κανείς κάποια μικρά ατοπήματα, όπως κάποιοι (ελάχιστοι) διάλογοι που φαντάζουν πια (λίγο) ξεπερασμ��νοι, η αποστασιοποιημένη αρχή και οι τελευταίες 50-60 σελίδες του βιβλίου που δεν είχαν την κλιμάκωση που περίμενα, το βιβλίο εκπλήσσει όταν συνειδητοποιείς πως γράφτηκε το 1965. Μ��στικισμός, υψηλή φαντασία, γνώσεις, μυθοπλαστική ικανότητα, όλα παντρεύουνται μεταξύ τους και δίνουν ένα αποτέλεσμα πραγματικά υπέροχο. Τα σημεία όπου περιγράφεται η έρημος αλλά και το ιδιαίτερο χάρισμα του πρωταγωνιστή, απλά είναι απαράμιλλα σε ποιότητα. Ο Herbert έχει πετύχει τη χρυσή τομη: οι αντιθέσεις μεταξύ των ειδών (ΕΦ και φάνταζι) ενισχύουν το σύνολο και χαρίζουν βάθος στην ιστορία. Δεν είναι καθόλου τυχαίο που αυτό το βιβλίο φιγουράρει ψηλά στη λίστα όσων αγαπούν το φανταστικό. Είχα αποφασίσει να διαβάσω το πρώτο βιβλίο για να έχω άποψη' τώρα ήδη σ��εδιάζω πότε θα μπουν στη λίστα και τα υπόλοιπα βιβλία!Όσοι ήσαστε σαν εμένα και δεν το έχετε διαβάσει, σπεύστε!"

Arrakis or Dune is a desert planet with the life extending drug melange or spice. The Emperor gives the planet to Duke Leto Atreides to manage replacing the evil House Harkonnen. However, the Harkonnens fight back and devastate the Atreides family leaving Jessica and her son Paul alive and who escape. They find refuge with the indigenous population of Fremen. It turns out Paul is the chosen one who will lead the Fremen to freedom. There is a lot of mystical, political intrigues as well as giant sandworms and battles between the two Nobel houses and the Emperor’s elite Sardaukar army of killers. The story is very imaginative and spawned a series of books although this one could stand alone. Paul and Jessica are not nice characters and are good and evil as well as a little self obsessed with their special powers. They manipulate the Fremen and play up to the prophecies the Fremen believe. The description the desert landscape, hidden caves and beliefs shows a magnificent imagination. Well worth a read."
