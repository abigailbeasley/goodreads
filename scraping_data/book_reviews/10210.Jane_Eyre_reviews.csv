Currer Bell had a much better chance of being published than Charlotte Bronte and, with reviewers and readers assuming that she was in fact a male writer, allowed the novel a chance to be weighed properly without prejudice. Jane Eyre became a bestseller. The question is, of course, would the novel have been so successful or even published at all if CHARLOTTE BRONTE had been emblazoned on the cover? I like to think that some editor would have realized the bloody brilliance of the story and would have published it anyway, even if they didn’t spend any money on promoting it. Would readers have bought it? Hopefully, word would have trickled out about how compelling the plot was, and people would have overcome their natural prejudice for reading a novel by a woman.  So isn’t it fun that Charlotte tricked everyone, including her own father? She did not confess her efforts to him until she had become successful. Even writing these words, I have a smile on my face thinking of this successful bamboozlement of publishers, editors, and readers.  The story, of course, is larger than the book. Most people with any kind of inquisitive nature have been exposed to the bare bones of this novel without ever reading the book. Maybe they watched a movie based on the book, or maybe they have heard it referenced. Once read, it is impossible for people not to use aspects of this novel as common reference points for other readers.  Take Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester himself, the master of Thornfield Hall. He is a brooding, complicated, dark, and intelligent creature. He is a force of nature who conforms the world around him with every stride he takes or every word that drops from his lips. He is the embodiment of the Lord Byron character. It doesn’t matter that he is not handsome. He is powerful. Women swoon in his presence and, after a carefully administered smelling salt, might start calculating what he is worth a year.  Rochester is completely taken by Jane Eyre, practically from the moment they meet. The drama of their meeting is one of those great cinematic scenes in the history of literature. Bronte incorporates many scenes into the novel that are, frankly, gifts to future movie renditions. Rochester has never met anyone quite like her. He is not alone. Everyone who comes into contact with Jane Eyre knows they have met a unique person. She is a kind and pleasant person, but she will not brook any discriminations against her character.  Mrs. Reed (her aunt), Mr. Brocklehurst (director of Lowood School attended by Jane), Mr. St John Eyre Rivers (minister who asks to marry her), and even Mr. Rochester, all attempt to conform Jane to the acceptable, deferring Victorian woman of the time. To call this a feminist novel does put it in a box which constrains it too tightly. Jane or Charlotte, either one, would loosen those bindings and let it breath as Charlotte’s intentions with this novel go well beyond the confines of any specific genre. I found her ideas of female equality, embodied so wonderfully in the character of Jane, inspiring. ”Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their effort, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer, and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.” I hear you, Charlotte. Can you imagine the impact of such words on your typical, Victorian housewife? A woman who has lived her whole life being the daughter of her father, the wife of her husband, the mother of her sons. She has been passed from the care of one man after another. If she were fortunate enough to be born pretty, she has that brief moment of power when suiters contend for her hand, but probably, ultimately, her father would decide who was best for her to marry. How about the impact of reading this novel on the typical, Victorian man? Did he look up from this book and peer over at his wife, she looking rosy in the firelight, knitting away at some frivolous thing, and think...does she want more? Or maybe he sees his pretty daughter enter the room on the verge of womanhood, and does he consider the possibility that she wants or deserves more?  There is no spark of revolution inspired by this book, but I do hope that this book may have chipped away at some of the archaic ideas of inequality. Maybe a few women readers realized that some of those secret desires they have harbored their whole life were not such strange concepts. When Jane stands up to the conformists she encounters, she is willing to take the punishment because she knows in her soul that what she believes about herself is incontestable.  This is no better illustrated than in her interactions with (I’m sorry to say this because it isn’t completely fair) the odious St. John Eyre Rivers. He wants to marry her but only for the sake that he believes she will make a wonderful, useful, missionary wife. He doesn’t love her. She is willing to go, but only as a “sister,” not as a wife. Jane refuses to compromise, but there is this moment where she is teetering in the balance. I’m mentally screaming to her at this point. ”I shuddered as he spoke: I felt his influence in my marrow--his hold on my limbs.” He is a cold man who would have gladly marched OUR Jane off to some godforsaken part of the world to die some horrible death from disease or from simple neglect.  I know the plot; and yet, I’m still completely invested in every scene. There is always the possibility that I’ve fallen into an alternative universe and I am reading some other version of Jane Eyre with a completely different ending. I can assure everyone this did not happen. When Jane is residing with Mrs. Read, she describes her place to sleep as a “small closet.” I can’t help but think of the closet under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive. Like Harry Potter, she is also an orphan but still with a rebellious streak because she is also sure that she is supposed to be someone other than who she is currently perceived to be. The relief she experiences when she learns she is getting away from the condescending attitude of the Read house and going away to school at Lowood also reminds me of Harry’s relief to discover he, too, is escaping to Hogwarts. Though I must say Harry, despite the trials and tribulations he experiences, draws a better straw than Miss Jane.  I really enjoyed the gothic elements; those were, to a degree, completely unexpected. ”’Oh sir, I never saw a face like it! It was a discoloured face--it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!’ ‘Ghost are usually pale, Jane.’ ‘This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes. Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?’ ‘You may.’ ‘Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre.’” There are noises in the night at Thornfield Hall. There is an unknown tenant locked away in the rafters of the house. There are secrets. There are unexpected fires. There are scandals waiting to be known. In fact, the twists of the plot were considered so outrageous for the time that the book acquired a reputation for being “improper.” This helped to boost sales further.  The Bronte family was very close. They grew up conceiving their own stories and fantasies and acting them out in impromptu plays. All three girls and the brother, Branwell, were writers. Tragically, they all died young. Charlotte outlived them all, dying in 1855 at the age of 38 with her unborn child. Branwell (31) and Emily (30) both passed away in 1848, and Anne died the following year at the age of 29. Can you imagine having to bury all your siblings? It must have felt like the spectre of death was stalking the Brontes.  What makes Rochester unique is that he does eventually see Jane the way she sees herself. ”Fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of his eyes.” I will remember that line ”desire of his eyes” for a long time. She is a hidden gem in rooms full of people. Charlotte Bronte makes some good points through Jane’s eyes at how unaware wealthy people are of the true natures of those who serve them.  I would talk about the love story, but what is there to say. It is one for the ages. I would say that Charlotte Bronte never found her Rochester in real life, but some letters have come to light, written to a man named Constantin Héger, that suggests that maybe she did. He was married to someone else, and when Elizabeth Gaskell wrote the biography of her friend, she carefully edited out those very revealing letters of a love that could never be.  Jane Eyre, may you always find the readers you deserve.

1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya,Rating 4 out of 5,"Yes, I suppose you can view this book mostly as a love story. That's what I did at age 13 - but that's why I was left disappointed back then¹.Or you can view this as an story of formation of a strong and independent female protagonist, a nineteenth-century feminist, light-years ahead of its time. And that's what left my now-closer-to-thirty-than-twenty self very satisfied and, quite frankly, rather impressed.²¹The guy kept his wife in the attic. Seriously - no. Just no. You don't get all the way to your SECOND wedding forgetting to mention that your FIRST wife is hidden in the attic. Seriosly, Rochester, what the hell is wrong with you? How can you even attempt to build a marriage on such a lie??? ² ""I do not think, sir, you have any right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.""Sing it, Jane. You tell him, you strong and awesome woman, you!
When I read it for the first time as a young and opinionated teen, I thought Jane Eyre was a boring and meek protagonist, too clingy to her 'outdated' morals, too afraid to do what I thought was a brave thing to do - say 'yes' to the apparent happiness that poor tragic Mr. Rochester was offering. (Oh naive young me, putting way too much stock in Rochester's woes after his first marriage, sleeping with everyone in Europe and rejecting them probably because they were not English enough for him!) Wow, was there ever a way to misunderstand a book more than I did this one? Sometimes life experience does matter indeed.Jane Eyre has a good idea of her self-worth. And she has a good idea about her own morals. And, unlike many in her situation, she sticks to her morals and her idea of what is wrong or right regardless of what outcome is in it for her. Here is the prime example:""Gentlemen in his station are not accustomed to marry their governesses.""The emphasis in this well-intentioned advice by Mrs. Fairfax is on the word MARRY. Ah, silly old lady, one may think, cautioning the young woman in such a prudish way. Ah, silly young woman, taking the advice of the old lady and acting prudishly. Ah, silly young woman, eventually rejecting the sincere love and offer of happiness for a seemingly prudish reason - not wanting to be a mistress. So old-fashioned and weak and caged-up, screamed my thirteen-year-old self.But here's the thing. It's not just for the moral lesson for the readers that Bronte has Jane firmly say 'no'. It's not for the sake of mere societal appearance. It's for the sake of Jane, and Jane alone. MARRYING governesses was uncommon. Having them as mistresses - probably not as rare. In her society, protecting her virtue and reputation was not only the matter of religious views or stigma - it was the question of her future, as she had nobody to stand up for her if her reputation was ruined. And it was a question of her integrity - the quality that she maintains through thick and thin, refusing to fall head over heels for love, refusing to let love justify all the mistakes and wrong choices, refusing to let love blind her to everything else that was important for her sense of self-worth.By refusing Rochester, Jane stays so true to herself without ever betraying herself. Jane refuses to take the steps that would destroy her integrity in her own eyes, and for that she has my strongest and most sincere respect and admiration. What Rochester did is unthinkable to her - not because of how others view it but because of her morals and convictions - and she shows unbelievable courage in sticking up for what she believes in, even if it is to her own material and soul-wrecking detriment. She will not give herself fully to something - or someone - that would destroy her integrity, tarnish her own self. And I love her for this unwavering determination to stay true to herself! ""Reader, I married him"" may be one of the most famous phrases from this book (actually, the most famous, come to think of it) - but it is her refusal to marry him in the first place that allows her to keep her integrity and remain true to self, and continue developing into the amazing person she becomes. Jane has too much self-worth to have Rochester until he redeems himself in her eyes, until he repents. That's the point, not the marriage part.Despite self-proclaimed meekness, Jane Eyre is far from weak or scared. She has been forced to make her own way in life without the luxury of relying on a rich male relative - father, brother, husband. And she did this in the world where being attached to a man was the best choice for a woman (just remember Jane Austen's heroines a few decades earlier reaching happiness only after finding a suitable gentleman!). She is a rebel - setting out to have her own career in a male-dominated world, refusing to let a man rule her life (that applies to both Rochester and St. John here), and making statements that may have not had the most sympathetic audience back in her day:""Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, to absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.""And here's what else I enjoyed about this book - its attempts to subvert the tropes, the same tropes that we still heavily rely on in literature. Bronte gets rid of the 'faultless' heroine - instead of being perfect (or having an imaginary flaw, like many literary heroines are prone to nowadays) Jane has a real one (for her time, at least) - her occasional temper. And she is not beautiful - not fake flaws, either but a consensus by many impartial observers that she is not a beauty. And to take it a step further - Mr. Rochester, our romantic lead, is quite frankly, rather ugly. This is not a beautiful couple (and Hollywood managed to ""fix"" that in all the movie adaptations, by the way - a slap in Bronte's face, I guess?). Jane is not in love with a pretty façade of Rochester - since he has none (a thing that contemporary writers should learn, by the way - writing love that stems from something else that simple attraction to physical beauty). And finally, the atmosphere of this story. Oh, the wonderfully gothic atmosphere written so well, with intense moods palpable in every paragraph. So colorful, so vivid, so immersing - every room, every moor, every tree. Every description of landscape or interior actually serves a purpose to establish the mood of the scene, and it is very well-done..................................All that said, I'm giving a condescending pat on the shoulder to my teenage self from the 'wisdom' of another fifteen years. Sorry, teen Nataliya, you little annoying know-it-all - you just needed to grow up to appreciate this story. 4.5 stars and high recommendation."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-sean-barrs,Rating 5 out of 5," Reader, I gave it five stars. Please let me tell you why. Jane Eyre is the quintessential Victorian novel. It literally has everything that was typical of the period, but, unlike other novels, it has all the elements in one story. At the centre is the romance between Jane and Rochester, which is enhanced by gothic elements such as the uncanniness of the doppleganger and the spectre like qualities of Bertha. In addition, it is also a governess novel; these were an incredibly popular type of storytelling in the age and for it to be combined with gothic elements, which are interposed with a dualistic relationship between realism and romance, is really quite unique. The correct term for this is a hybrid, in which no genre voice is dominant; they exist alongside each other creating one rather special book. And this is so, so, special; it’s an excellent piece of literature. Jane’s journey is gut wrenching and emotional. Through her life she experiences real sorrow, the kind that would make a lesser person give up. She also experiences real friendship, the type that comes across perhaps once in a lifetime. But, most significantly, she experiences true love and the development of independence to form he own ending. I really do love this book. Bronte utilises the first person narrative, which creates a high degree of intimacy with her character; it makes me feel like I know Jane as well as she comes to know her own self. “I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.” Jane’s a strong willed individual. From a very young age she had the clarity of intelligence to recognise the injustice that was her life; yes, she is narrating her story retrospectively, though she still had the perceptiveness to realise how mistreated she was. I love the pathetic fallacy Bronte uses at the beginning. The child Jane looks out the window, shielded by the curtain, and witnesses the horrible weather. It is cold and bleak; it is windy and morose; thus, we can immediately see the internal workings of Jane’s mind. The weather reflects her feelings throughout the novel, and at the very beginning the situation was at its worse. This can also be seen with the fire imagery that represents her rage when she is shoved in the red room; it later mirrors that of Bertha’s fury. Everybody needs love, children especially so. These early experiences help to define her later character, and, ultimately influence how she sees the world; she still hides behind a curtain in Rochester’s house when he flirts with Miss Ingrum. These experiences set her on an almost perpetual quest for love, for belonging and for the independence to make her own decisions. She finds friendship in the form of Helen Burns; she gives her some sound advice, but Jane cannot fully accept such religious fatalism. However, it does inspire her, a little, to continue with life; she realises, no matter what happens, she will always have the love of her greatest friend. Jane clings to this idea, but, ultimately, has to seek a more permanent solution to her loneliness. She needs a vocation, one that will fulfil her and give her life meaning; thus, she becomes a governess and crosses paths with the downtrodden, miserable wretch that is Mr Rochester.  Sometimes I feel like Rochester didn’t know quite what he wanted. When he sees Jane he sees a woman with strength, blunt honesty and integrity: he sees an emotional equal. This attracts her to him, which develops into love. However, when he tries to express his love he does it through trying to claim her as his own. Through doing so, not only does he show the nature of Victorian marriage, he shows his own deep vulnerability. He loves her mind, her intelligence, and he too wants to be loved. He longs for it with a frightening passion. So, instead of doing things the way Jane would have wanted him to do, he overwhelms her with expensive affection. By doing so he almost loses her. All Jane wanted was his heart, nothing more nothing less. By showering her with such flattery and expensive items, he insults her independence. He risks destroying the thing that attracted him to her in the first place, their equality; their mutual respect and love. He takes away her dignity. I really don’t think the original marriage would have worked. Ignore the existence of the mad woman in the attic; I just think Rochester would have spoilt it. It would have become too awkward. They needed to be on the same societal level as well as one of intellect and character. The ending is touching and a little sad, but it is the only one that could ever have worked for these two characters. Without the tragedy there could never have be rejuvenation and the chance for them to be together on equal terms, no matter what it cost to get there. If that wasn’t enough reason for me to love this book, there are also elements of fantasy and desire. This is a realism novel, it pertains to credible events, but the suggestions of fantasy only add to the strong romantic notions. Rochester is enamoured by Jane; he cannot believe that a woman like her actually exists. All his misguided notions are brushed away in an instant. Whilst he views Jane as special, it is clear that he realises that other women may also have a similar rebellious voice, only hidden. He considers her an elf, a witch, an improbable woman that has captured his desire, his heart, his soul, his life. He knows he will never be the same again. From Jane’s point of view, her first encounter with him is otherworldly. She had grown bored with her governess role, and when she sees the approach of Rochester and his dog Pilot, she sees the gytrash myth; she wants to see something fantastical instead she finds her heart, which is something much rarer. Then there are also the feminist elements. Jane transgresses the boundary associated with her gender in the Victorian age. For a woman to be recognised as having equal intellect to that of a man was sadly a rare thing. Women could actually attend university, but the downside was they could never get the full degree. They could spend months studying, though never be recognised as actually having gained the qualification. It was just another attempt to keep women under the thumb, so for Bronte to portray the truth of Jane’s equal intellect is a great step for the recognition of women, and women writers. This book received a whole host of negative reviews at the time of its publication for this element alone. Stupid really, but that’s misogyny for you. Reader, I love this book. I really could go on, but this is getting kind of long. I hope I’ve made it clear why I love this story so much. I shall be reading this again later this year to correspond with my exams, which I’m already looking forward to- the reading that is, not the exams. I don’t think will ever have read this story enough though.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am a very pretentious person.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...I try to seem “hip” and “cool” and “relatable” and “down with the teens” - and of course I totally am all of those things - but also I have my tendencies toward pretension. It’s who I am. Just last night I shuddered at the idea of popular music, like some kind of eight-hundred-year-old gremlin.I am not proud of this side of me, but it’s who I am. And also it is important background information for you, dear Reader, going into this review. (That direct address to you as an audience member was me emulating this book, not an example of my pretension. Or was it???)Anyway. It’s important that you know my capacity to be pretentious so that I can make this statement:I don’t get how any reader can say they don’t like classics.Oof. A doozy, right? Aren’t you glad I warned you? Now you know that that wasn’t just a one-off of self-serious condescension but rather a pattern of my personality and oh sh*t actually my explanation probably made the whole thing a million times worse. Now I’ve painted my insufferability as consistent.Come back, everyone!!!! Let me explain!What I need to explain is that this book is excellent, and also a classic. It is very very old but sometimes old stuff is still worth it! (I should know. I have the mannerisms of the type of grumpy old man that gets endearingly profiled in Scandinavian bestsellers.)This is not the classic I would recommend that someone start with if they’re looking to get into the genre. It is very, very slow, and very wordy, and the language takes some settling in. But also this book is a literal gem.It was published in 19th century England, which is no one’s idea of Progressive Central. But this book is jarringly feminist when the constraints it (and Jane) were working in are taken into account. Jane is an independent woman, and this book from eighteen freakin’ forty-seven tells her story.Now, I love Jane Austen books as much as the next girl (if the next girl is pretty damn obsessed with Jane Austen), but that’s something not even all her books can say.Here’s the thing about this book: I love nineteenth century fiction (or what I’ve read of it), but even if you didn’t you’d probably love this book. So much of this is unique, by the standards of then but also even the standards of today. It’s a romance, yes, which: extremely normal. But it’s a romance between two characters who are not conventionally beautiful, which is unbelievably rare. It’s also not a romance that acts as basically the sole option for its female character. I love Pride & Prejudice, and I of course think Lizzie Bennet is a feminist (and awesome) character, but there’s no way for that book to end, really, that doesn’t include marriage for her. Three of the five Bennet sisters get married over the course of that book. It’s either that or old maid status, baby.But not lil Jane Eyre. She does not allow marriage to be the only prospect for her!! She goes away and makes a life for herself and then decides whether she wants to follow that path. We don’t even see that in every 21st century romance.Plus, Jane is an excellent character, and of a type we RARELY see. She’s serious and upstanding and smart and moral. She has a strong mind and she doesn’t shy away from that. She lacks the requisite features of today’s female subjects of romance: the quirkiness or the humor or the adorkable way she trips and falls/spills coffee/etc. She also lacks the nineteenth-century version of a lot of those traits. And it is so goddamn refreshing I can’t even tell you.And on top of all that, the language in this book is so gorgeous I want the whole manuscript tattooed on me.Which would be wild, because this is about a million pages long. And speaking of, yes, it is very slow and hard to get into and basically you have to adjust to a whole new reading experience. So I wouldn’t recommend starting off your nineteenth century fiction binge with this book.But I would recommend getting into nineteenth century fiction solely for the purpose of reading this book.Bottom line: IT’S JUST SO DAMN GOOD, YOU GUYS.-------------pre-reviewhey um...i love this book so stupid much???if you've got a free few hours over the course of the next few months i HIGHLY recommend rereading this book at a snail's pace. worked out for me very well.i should probably shout about my adoration of this book for several pages so. full review 2 come"

The Written Review

""Though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's heart and--it would not do."" ""It would do,"" I affirmed with some disdain, ""perfectly well.
Oh Jane, you wondrously bold and beautiful gal. After she was orphaned, Jane Eyre was sent to live with her maternal uncle and his wife (Mrs. Reed). When her uncle dies, he forces his wife to swear to love, nurture and care for Jane as if she was their own child. Unsurprisingly, Mrs. Reed is not pleased in the least with this arrangement and does the absolute bare minimum towards Jane. She spoils her three biological children but sees Jane as a wicked, conniving and devilish child (despite ample evidence against). 
 I know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child—though equally dependent and friendless—Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling
 Jane is sent off to boarding school where life is harsher than before (threadbare clothes, small rations) but she prefers it for she has finally found what she's been missing.
There is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
 At the end of her time there, she sets off to be a governess. She takes a job for a Mr. Rochester and tutors his young ward, Adel. Only, when she arrives at the house, she starts to notice certain things. The servants know something is up and won't tell her. Mr. Rochester is hiding a huge mystery and despite the danger, and the difference in social standing, Jane Eyre is falling ever faster in love.An absolutely stunning book. This is my third time through, and each time I am blown away by Jane's strength of character. With every twist life hurled at her, Jane merely straightened her shoulders, adjusted her pack and trudged on. Each time I read this novel, I notice something different. This time, it was how much Charlotte Bronte slipped her own beliefs into the novel:
Precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings...It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.

5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4687823-vinaya,Rating 5 out of 5,"FIVE REASONS WHY JANE EYRE WOULD NEVER BE A BESTSELLER IN OUR TIMES:5. Four hundred-odd pages of purely descriptive writing4. Overt religious themes and moral preaching3. A plain-Jane heroine who stays plain. No makeovers to reveal a hitherto hidden prettiness that only needed an application of hydrogen peroxide and some eyebrow plucking to emerge full-blown.2. The world is not well-lost for love. In the war between self-respect and grand passion, principles win hands down. Rousing, yet tender speeches do not make our heroine forsake her creed to fall swooning and submissive into her alpha's arms. 1. NO SEX!!!When I was a little girl, I had a doll named Saloni. Now Saloni wasn't a particularly attractive specimen as dolls go, especially since, over the years, I had drilled a hole in her little rosebud mouth in order to 'feed' her, I had 'brushed' her hair till all the poor synthetic threads had fallen out and I had dragged her around with me so much, one of her big blue eyes had fallen off. But in my eyes, Saloni was the best doll ever created. She was my comfort, my mainstay in a world filled with confusing new things like school and daycare and other little people. Jane Eyre is my grown-up version of Saloni. Comfort food for my brain. There are two authors I will read over and over and over again, until the day I die. One of them is Charlotte Bronte, the other one is Georgette Heyer. I have read Jane Eyre a million times, but I never tire of the story. Every time I reach the scene where she professes her love to Mr. Rochester, I come out in goosebumps. Every single time. Age and experience have taught me to spot the flaws in the story and the characters. The ineffable belief in English superiority. The condescending attitude towards servants and people of the lower class. The ill-treatment of mentally disabled people. The almost Quaker-ish sentiments of Jane Eyre. But all of this detracts not a whit from one of the greatest love stories ever told. And there are a lot of things to admire in this book as well. Edward Rochester, ugly as sin, but powerful and dominant and unbelievably attractive in spite of his looks. A love that grows and strengthens on the basis of mutual sympathy, respect and a meeting of the minds, that a lot of our authors would do well to learn from. Jane Eyre, who does not think that her great love excuses acts of selfishness and immorality. Despite being drawn as a somewhat submissive personality, Jane manages to hold her own with quiet fortitude, never loudly asserting her intelligence or talent, but nonetheless displaying a strength of character that would put the Bellas and Noras of out time to shame. Jane Eyre would never, as I have said above, be a bestseller if it had been written in our times. And that is a loss we must take upon ourselves. That we have put such prime value on lust and looks and power that we have forgotten to be real in our writing. There is a reason why millions of people the world over remember and revere a book written a hundred and fifty-odd years ago while the bestsellers of our times slip quickly and quietly from our memories. Jane Eyre is more than just a beautiful book about a love story that transcends all boundaries; it is a testament to the power of pure emotion, that can be felt through the ages and across all barriers of time and culture."

For me ‘Jane Eyre’ would define it.5 ✨ brooding, uncompromising, passionate, but tormenting stars, for my favourite book of all time. I love this book for the way it depicts the strength of the human spirit, the importance of being yourself, the rights of women, and the explicit yet beautiful way the story is told. Dramatic, uninhibited, and evocative. Jane Eyre is best known or described as a ‘gothic love story’ but for me it is so much more. It is an emotional life story that contrasts the extremities of love and hate, where the principled and incorruptible mind battles the unscrupulous and most brutal of beasts and rules. Jane Eyre is an unapologetic feminist story, like no other. It is an emotional story where one woman’s soul was forever tormented by the people she tried to love and cursed by those who did not deserve to own nor judge her. However, the standout is the rawness in which the author expresses Jane’s feelings of love, hurt, and anguish, and the many themes it embraces particularly for its time. A burning question is ‘why do I love this book so much?’ The storyline? the love story? the many themes it embraces? or is it Jane Eyre, the character I love the most? All will be revealed, but first the plot.The PlotThe story begins with Jane, orphaned after the death of her parents and further isolated when her uncle dies leaving her in the hands of his heartless family. After an unpleasant and bloody exchange with her cousin, and then aunt, Jane is sent to Lowood. A charitable but educational institution.It is at this point in the book that we get an early insight into the character of the 10-year-old Jane, her principles and unwavering determination to speak up for what is right and just, when she admonishes her aunt “I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed….. “How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth. You think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity…. you are bad, hard-hearted. You are deceitful!”.Jane’s early battle with life’s cruel reality was to continue with the death of a beautiful and kind pupil Helen, but her resolve saw her through 8 years at Lowood at which point and now educated, she applies to Thornfield Hall for the position of governess. The home that is to become hers after falling in love with its master, Edward Rochester. Yet lady fate was to have her day again when Jane discovers in the most humiliating wedding scene that Rochester’s wife still lives, but insane.After one of the most touching exchanges between these two very different lovers. The characters of Jane and Rochester are laid bare; their passions, principles, and virtues are exposed for us to savour and appraise. He a brooding and selfish man asks Jane to live on as his mistress, while Jane’s honour prevents her from embracing such an immoral life, which would be contrary to her principles. She wants more for herself, not driven by ambition but by virtue and the right to think and love freely.Fleeing Thornfield Hall, Jane finds solace in the sequestered Moor home, with St John and his sisters. St John, a devoutly religious man also seeks Jane’s affections and help as a missionary, but not love. Once again we hear the painful and agonising words from Jane, that can only but leave an imprint on the mind and the heart of the reader…“Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much soul as you — and full as much heart”And yes, she does. Jane Eyre is one of the most fascinating characters in fictional history, and if you don’t love the book, you will at least love this character.Review and CommentsThis is my sixth time reading Jane Eyre (although twice at school) and every time I read it, I get something different from the story. However, this is the first time reviewing and the first time I have challenged myself to explaining why this story means so much to me, apart from it being the first classic book I ever fell in love with, which will always have its rightful place in my book history. No film adaption has done it justice and no words that I write can capture the beauty that lies within these pages. Of course, I can write words, so inspiring is this book, but cannot express how I truly feel with this book the way Charlotte Bronte can write with such rawness. I also need to restrict myself to covering the key themes and elements otherwise I would be writing a book about a book. So first up is the character development. ‘Jane Eyre’ sets the bar in character development and is one of the best I have ever read for this. There is nothing left to the imagination and the explicit way emotions and feelings are portrayed is remarkable, sentimental but also appropriate. The character traits of the two key male characters, Rochester and St John are evocative and ignite frustration and even slight anger in the reader. One man would turn his back on the laws of God and society for the love of the young Jane, whilst the other obsessive and devout has expectations of self-sacrifice for God, his own vanity and ambition. Whilst different, both men possess the same unwavering sense of entitlement, and lack humility and understanding when they offer Jane a life contrary to her beliefs, honour, and feelings. St John says to her“… you are formed for labour, not for love. A missionary’s wife you must—shall be. You shall be mine: I claim you—not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign’s service.” While Rochester’s disregard of what Jane represents is equally as distasteful, he does draw sympathy from the reader because there are displays of kindness towards others and his love for Jane is unquestionable if not selfish. Once again it is Jane’s response that ignited a wave of emotions in me “Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour” Feminism, Religion, and Class are constant themes through the novel where the eponymous Jane tells her own story. If you consider the period in which this book was written; the content and storyline, the uninhibited expressions of love and anger as well as the uncensored view of feminism, then you can begin to appreciate just how incredibly provocative this book might have been for the times. On many occasions, Jane describes herself as someone’s ‘equal’ not to be caged in a social class nor defined by society’s expectation of the role of women. It is this freedom of expression, independence of mind, and moral commitment that consumed me so much in this story.“I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.” At this point I reveal that the reason I love this book so much is because of Jane Eyre’s character. It is the most extraordinary story about an ordinary young woman, although a heroine in my eyes. A woman guided by honour, influenced, and dedicated but not cosseted by religion. An independent woman who is highly principled and determined yet loving and generous, and passionate but not vindicative. A young woman who wants to live, love, and think freely, and in that lies the beauty of this book. How groundbreaking, daring, and courageous from the incredibly gifted Charlotte Bronte. Second to that is the uninhibited depiction of the characters, their emotions, and the inner battles they must conquer in the face of temptation. All of this of course is brought to life with Bronte's perfectly chosen words, vivid descriptions and unbridled but elegant prose. There is such a rawness to the writing, although some would say overly dramatic but for me it is another beautiful and remarkable aspect to this book, because it works.Jane Eyre is a book that is bold for the way it inspires feminism, courageous in the way it challenges the accepted norms of society and religion but is also respectful. There is beauty in the storytelling, sincerity in these righteous but flawed characters, and artistry in the way the themes have been woven into the story – an epic masterpiece in literature. “I have for the first time found what I can truly love—I have found you. You are my sympathy—my better self— my good angel.” Says Rochester.And my GR friends, I too have found (in books) what I truly love, and it is this timeless classic that is likely to remain as my #1 book of all time, for all time. In the dawn of a new year in books, what better way to have started my new reading year than with Jane Eyre, the principled, loving feminist, and her story._____________________________I just finished 'Wide Sargasso Sea' by Jean Rhys, a prequel or retelling of sorts that I would highly recommend for readers and lovers of Jane Eyre. It is an accompaniment to Jane Eyre and provides some context to the events leading up to and the marriage of Bertha to Rochester, which Jane Eyre does not explore in any depth. Haunting, vividly depicted and a lens on Bertha that is somewhat different to the image created by Rochester. Fabulous."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily,Rating 5 out of 5,"Child neglect, near death, a dash of magical realism, the power of love, the powerlessness of the poor, sexual rivalry, mystery, madness and more. It is as powerful as ever - but is it really a love story, given Rochester's Svengali-tendencies, or is it a life story? His downfall and her inheritance make them more equal, but is it really love on his part? I'm not sure, which is what makes it such a good book (just not necessarily a love story). I also like the tension between it being very Victorian in some obvious ways, and yet controversially modern in others: an immoral hero, a fiercely independent and assertive heroine, and some very unpleasant Christians (it's not that I think Christians are bad or like seeing them portrayed in a nasty way - it's Bronte's courage in writing such characters I admire). ChildhoodAbout the first quarter of the book concerns the tremendous hardship and abuse that Jane suffers growing up. It's often heavily cut from film, TV and stage adaptations, but despite the fluff about this being a great love story, I think there is merit in paying attention to her formative years as an essential element of explaining what makes Jane the person she becomes.The Red Room, where young Jane is banished shortly before being sent to Lowood, is a very short episode in the book, but its significance is probably greater than its brevity implies. The trauma of the Red Room is not just because Mr Reed died there, but because of the associations of red = blood = death, compounded by cold, silence, blinds that are always closed and a bed like a sacrificial altar. Is it also some sort of reference to Bertha's attic?Jane endures dreadful hardships: she is orphaned; her aunt says she is ""less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep"" and invokes the wrath of God who ""might strike her dead in the midst of one of her tantrums""; she endures injustice as she strives to be good, but is always condemned, while the faults of her cousins are indulged or ignored. So, she is sent to Lowood, where she sees the hypocritical tyranny of Brocklehurst, survives cold and near starvation and witnesses her best friend's death. Nevertheless, ""I would not have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for Gateshead and its daily luxuries."" There is a dreadful irony in the fact that the first time a relative demonstrates any interest in her (John Eyre), it seems to ruin everything. Villains and ChristianityWho is the worst villain: John Reed, Aunt Reed, Mr Brocklehurst, Blanche Ingram, St John Rivers or even Rochester?Christianity gets a very mixed press in the book: Mr Brocklehurst is cruel and comically hypocritical (curly hair is evil vanity in poor girls, who ""must not conform to nature"", but fine for his pampered daughters); St John Rivers thinks his devoutness selfless, but is actually cold and selfish (his motive being to gain glory in Heaven for himself); Helen Burns is a redemptive Christ figure who accepts her punishments as deserved, helps Jane tame herself (""Helen had calmed me"") and, of course, dies. Jane's own beliefs (or lack) are always somewhat vague (though she's very moral) and controversially feisty. When, as a small girl, the nasty Brocklehurst asks her what she should do to avoid going to Hell, she replies, ""I must keep in good health, and not die""!Aspects the way Christianity is portrayed may make it more accessible to modern readers from more secular backgrounds, but might have been shocking to devout Victorians. Perhaps they were placated by the fact that despite the cruelty, Jane forgives Aunt Reed for trying to improve her errant niece, even though ""it was in her nature to wound me cruelly"".Male Power, Feminism, and Relevance TodayMen had most of the power and respect in Bronte's time and often Jane has to go along with that. However, Bronte does subvert that to some extent by making Jane so assertive, determined and independent. The story of Jane Eyre has parallels with the story of Bluebeard, albeit with a very different ending, in which the woman takes charge of her own destiny. Bluebeard was well-known in Victorian fables as a rich and swarthy man who locked discarded wives in an attic (though he killed them first). He took a new young wife and when she discovered her predecessors, he was about to kill her, but she was rescued by her brothers, rather as Mason wants to rescue Bertha. Jane even likens an attic corridor to one in ""some Bluebeard's castle"", so Bronte clearly knew the story and assumed he readers did too. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluebear....Despite her minimal contact with men, right from the outset Jane instinctively knows how to respond to the man she describes as ""changeful and abrupt"". When they first meet in the house and he is quizzing her, she consciously mirrors his tone (""I, speaking as seriously as he had done"") and ""His changes of mood did not offend me because I saw I had nothing to do with their alteration"". Like many bullies, he enjoys a bit of a fight, rather than the nervous, prompt and unquestioning obedience his manner normally elicits, and Jane isn't afraid to answer him back and speak her mind. It isn't long before she can say ""I knew the pleasure of vexing him and soothing him by turns"". When Blanche arrives, Jane realises ""he had not given her his love"" and that ""she could not charm him"" (as she could). At this point, she realises her self-delusions in overlooking his faults and merely considering them as ""keen condiments"".What should modern women make of this book? Bronte is radical in that neither Jane nor Rochester is conventionally attractive (it is personality that matters) and Jane is fiercely independent and assertive, even when she gives the impression of being submissive. She even says, ""Women are supposed to feel very calm, generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint... precisely as men would suffer."" On the other hand, Rochester's treatment of Jane, Bertha, Blanche and Céline is hard to justify (other than the fact he keeps Bertha alive - why not kill her?). Does disappointment and disability truly changed him, and does that, coupled with her independent wealth make them equals? Will they live happily ever after?RochesterWhat were Rochester's plans and motives for his relationship with Jane? Why does he insist that Jane appears in the drawing room every evening while Blanche and friends are staying, even though he fully understands and comments on how depressed it makes Jane? And would Rochester have married Blanche if Mason hadn't turned up, making a big society wedding impossible? If so, was Jane always in his mind as a mistress and backup in case marriage to Blanche was not possible, or did he only decide to marry her much later? What sort of basis for a happy marriage is that, and can the equalising effect of his later disability and her inheritance really conquer it? It's true that Rochester tells Jane ""I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you as madly in love with me as I was with you"", but that is after Mason's visit, so is it true?Rochester's treatment of Bertha is even more problematic: divorce wasn't viable, and yet he didn't want to leave her behind in the Caribbean... very odd. In a funny sort of way, he might have felt he was doing the right thing by her, or at least, not the wrong thing. In a society which condemns divorce and cohabitation, is Rochester's planned bigamy justifiable? As Rochester hints to Jane early on, ""Unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules"". He also knows that Jane's integrity means she must be unaware of the details if he is to be with her (he says that if he asked her to do something bad, she would say ""no sir... I cannot do it, because it is wrong""), though in fact there is a bigger tussle between her head and heart than he might have expected. Later, he ponders the fact that she is alone in the world as being some sort of justification, ""It will atone"" and extends to the more blasphemous and deluded ""I know my Maker sanctions what I do. For the world's judgement - I wash my hands thereof."" St JohnJane's bond with St John is very different, and she realise it, ""I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt daily more and more that I must disown half my nature"". His proposal is positively alarming, ""You are formed for labour, not for love. A missionary's wife you must - shall be. You shall be mine: I claim you - not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's service""! Under the guise of serving God and man, he is irredeemably self-serving.Magic Realism?The strangest element is the small but hugely significant ethereal message from Rochester that might now be called magical realism. It sits oddly with the rest of the book, but I can never decide whether this is it a strength or a weakness.Who Knows What?A constant theme is ""who knows what?"". Is Aunt Reed ignorant of how awful Lowood is and has she truly convinced herself that her treatment of Jane is appropriate? How much does Mrs Fairfax know (and tell) about Rochester's wives, current and intended? Does Rochester know whether or not Adele is really his daughter, and what does Jane believe? Blanche appears to know very little, but is she only seeing what she wants to see? Love?Overall, there is so much in this book, it is well worth rereading, but I am not convinced that it is a love story. It is the easiest label to apply, and although Jane certainly finds love, I am not sure that love finds her. They're intellectually well-matched, and the sparring and physical attraction bode well. On the other hand, my doubts about his motivations when he was juggling Blanche and Jane make me uneasy. Incidentally, I first read this book at school (a naive mid-teen enjoys and appreciates it for very different reasons than an adult). One day, we were at a point when Jane was with the Rivers and possibly being courted by St John. We were told to read to page x for homework, so I turned to that page to mark it and saw the famous words (not that I knew they were), ""Reader, I married him"" and was shocked to assume it referred to St John.Jane's Place in My LifeThere are many reasons I love this book, including - but not limited to:1. The cliché of first reading this at an impressionable age (15).2. Coming with no preconceptions, other than knowing it was a classic - so I had a couple of big surprises in the plot.3. Being at a boarding school myself at the time - though fortunately not (much) like Lowood.4. Questioning my faith and the role of religion - then and since.5. Questioning the roles and rights of women - then and since.6. Jane, herself. That's a major one.7. The fact the book is daringly subversive for its time (most of the Christians are bad, and Jane is fiercely outspoken and independent - most of the time). 8. I get something new from it each time.Like many, I first read this at school. I was captivated from the outset. Jane was wild, and brave, and rebellious - all things we weren't supposed to be, and yet we had to read and write about her. I vaguely knew about the wedding scene, but everything about her time with the Rivers was new and unexpected. For all that I had doubts about Rochester, I felt (in a naive, teenage way) I shared a passion for him. When I thought Jane would end up with St John, I was devastated. The actual ending was a happy relief - all the more so because it had been unexpected. I thought I understood the book, and got good marks for essays about it (apart from the injustice of being deducted marks for a comment a teacher refused to believe I hadn't copied from Brodie's Notes - a study guide I'd only ever heard of!). But like all great works of art, it speaks differently on each encounter, and the more I've read it, aided by a bit of maturity along the way, and now discussions with GR friends, the more I've seen in it.So no, this not a love story - on the pages. But there is a love story: between the reader and Jane. PrequelI finally read Jean Rhys' prequel ""Wide Sargasso Sea"", reviewed here: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...2011 FilmI was disappointed with the Jane Eyre film. Mia Waskikowska was good as Jane, and it looked right, but Fassbender as Rochester was awful. He didn't brood enough for my liking, but what I think is less excusable is that he didn't really change during the course of the story. Just as bad, Jamie Bell was too nice to be St John. In fact the whole episode at the Rivers' was very poorly done. Overall, it removed all ambiguity, making a complex story of truth and lies, divided loyalty and mixed emotions boringly straightforward."

I have to say that I should probably reread everything I read bank in High School to get a better perspective. I enjoyed the book quite a bit this time. The story in intricate and dark. Jane Eyre is a tragic hero who does her best through the whole book but keeps encountering unfortunate situation after unfortunate situation. The story held my interest a lot more than some other classic novels I have read. My only complaint was a few times certain plot points were belabored. I found myself saying, ""Okay, I get it, let's move on.""So, everyone, if you remember a book from your youth with less than enthusiastic fondness, it might be worth giving it another shot.

YOU MAY NOT WANT TO READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU PLAN ON READING JANE EYRE.I read Jane Eyre for the first time as an adult and I can't help but feel sorry for every junior high or high school student who was forced to read this book. I thought getting through this book was very difficult. I assumed I would love it since I generally love books by Jane Austen, but I didn't find many similarities at all. Jane Eyre was boring and unbelievable. I did enjoy the first half of the book because I had such hope for her, but then it just became dull and unrealistic. I never bought the romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester, nor did I buy the coincidence of her happening to arrive on the doorstep of the only relations she has in all of England during her time of need. I also find it strange that she dedicates the last paragraphs of the book primarily to St. John Rivers, when he was such a small part of her life, not to mention the fact that the part he did play was primarily negative.Bronte failed to draw me into the lives of these characters or like them, frankly, which made this a very long read for me.

In which precious little happens except that you start to realize that editing must be a fairly young profession and that perhaps if you really hated your English students you could pick out one of the sentences that is roughly the same length as the Gettysburg Address and make them diagram it? For reals, you'd get these honking paragraphs that would start, ""There was..."" and then if you were diagramming you'd have a frightfully kudzu-covered six-story scaffold of indirect objects and modifiers trailing behind it.What is it about Jane Eyre that seems to be an educated female rite of passage? I was somewhat looking forward to this book as it's an example of a strong woman who knows herself, but no. She's basically being ping-ponged between a couple of over-verbose dweebs who both have frightfully controlling tendencies and her only hope of independence is getting a windfall through the mother of all deus ex machina. Ladies: Jane is holding you back. Protip: if a guy twice your age who freely admits his proclivity for continental floozies, gruffly dismisses his own possible child except to underpay staff to deal with her, is intense and flies into passions, makes you mop up after and keep silent about assaults in your home and then fails to mention until you're at the altar that oh, he's married and the psycho who tried to kill you in your bed is actually his WIFE, you get gone and stay gone. Seriously, if I wanted to read about a teenager who spent half her time complaining about her looks and then dithering around about whether to go with the dark brooding intense hottie or the fair,marble-faced Greek god, I would go read Twilight.

22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm bumping Jane Eyre up to the full five stars on this reread. It has its Victorian melodramatic moments (horrible aunt! and cousins! mad wife secretly hidden away in the attic! heroine starving in the wilderness!), but overall I found this story of a plain, obscure girl determined to maintain her self-respect, and do what she feels is right even in the face of pressure, profoundly moving. And I'm a romantic, sorry/notsorry, so that aspect totally sucked me in too. And it really is a great romance, at least in my book, but it's just so much more than that.Reasons I Love Jane Eyre:1. Jane is no beauty. There's no Cinderella moment. Deal with it. Her beauty is all on the inside.2. Rochester is not gorgeous. This is not going to change either. In fact, his outward appearance gets worse in the end. And it doesn't matter! When's the last time you read a romance where neither the heroine nor the hero was good-looking?3. Great dialogue. Rochester makes sarcastic comments to Jane all the time. She sasses him right back.4. This is a romance of the mind and the heart, not just OMG HE'S SO HOT AND HIS LIPS MAKE ME MELT. (Though there's definitely physical attraction here too.)5. Jane maintains her pride and self-respect. She sticks to her principles, even when the pressure's on, even when it would be much easier, and would bring her much more short-term happiness, to let those principles go hang.6. Jane Eyre takes a very nuanced view of religion: there are hypocrites, in at least a couple of different variations. There are hard, cold people who sometimes use religion as a tool, or an excuse for what they do. There are saintly characters who always turn the other cheek. And there are believers, like Jane, who are imperfect but are doing the best they can. 7. Jane teaches us that we have a great power to take control of our lives and decide our own destiny, even when the cards are all stacked against us. It's up to us to take action to change our lives, not wait for someone else to change it for us.8. Jane Eyre empowered women, written at a time when in so many ways we were considered second-class citizens. It still empowers us now.Women ... feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, to absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.Buddy (re-)read with Jess, Karly, Vane, Kristin, Rabbit, and Andrea.P.S. The Kindle version available for free at Project Gutenberg has wonderful pencil drawing illustrations.Bonus: excerpts from Texts from Jane Eyre: And Other Conversations with Your Favorite Literary Characters **spoiler alert**JANEMY LITTLE SUNBEAMWHERE ARE YOUI NEED YOU BY MY SIDEI’m taking a walkbe back for dinnerAH YES MY CAGED SPRITECOMMUNE WITH NATURE AND UPON YOUR RETURNRELATE TO ME THE VAGRANT GLORIES OF THE RUINED WOODSdo you really want me to describe my walk to youMORE THAN ANYTHING YOU POCKET WITCHit is fairly cloudy outlooks like rain soonAHHH TO THINK THAT MY LITTLE STARLING JANESHOULD RETURNTO PERCH ON MY BROKEN MALFORMED SHOULDERSINGING A SONG OF THE GREY AND WRACKING SKIESMAKES MY HEART SWELL TO BURSTall right—JANE WHERE HAVE YOU GONEI AM BEREFT AND WITHOUT MY JANE I SHALL SINK INTO ROGUERYi am with my cousinsWHICH COUSINIS IT THE SEXY ONEPlease don’t try to talk to me againIT IS YOUR SEXY COUSIN“ST.

29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne,Rating 2 out of 5,"Whew! I finished this one this morning, and I'm glad I finally read it. I can't say, however, that I enjoyed it, would recommend it, or will ever read it again.Not in this lifetime, anyway.  For starters, I didn't like Jane. Yeah, when she was a kid I felt sorry for her, but the older she got the less I liked her. Her religious convictions and the decisions she made because of them had Bertha looking like the picture of sanity by comparison. Speaking of, why in the world did she wander off in the middle of the night with no money?What did she think would happen? Was manna supposed to drop out of heaven? And I don't buy that an educated, sensible woman would just run off into the night without taking enough with her to make sure she could survive. An idiot would have better sense than that.But by the end of the story, I was almost wishing she had wandered off after St John and contracted some disease. The fact that she didn't totally realize what an awful freak St John was nailed the lid on her coffin to me. Even at the very end of the book, she kept talking about all of the great works he was doing for God.  Seriously? He was an ass, and I would have told him to give me my five thousand pounds back! At least Bronte had the sense to kill him off at the end. Well, maybe he wasn't quite dead yet, but he was on his way to meet his maker. Ugh.I also thought it was more than just a teeny bit fishy that she ended up on the doorstep of the only family she had in the entire world. Exactly how likely is that? Not very.  Then there is the man himself, Mr. Rochester. He wasn't anything to write home about for sure. Let's start with the obvious, shall we? He was cold, condescending, secretive. Wow. Oh yeah, and he was ugly to boot. Yum. Can anything else be said about him to make him more of a catch? I know! Just in case, let's have him keep a drooling homicidal wife hidden away in the attic! Personally, I think Bronte had covered all the bases at this point.Did he honestly not see anything wrong with letting her marry him while he had that crazy bat of a wife locked upstairs? If he had just told her the situation to start with, I might have liked him a little better. Nah. Probably not. I never actually figured out what she saw in him. My best guess ended up being low self-esteem coupled with a bad childhood. The 'gothic mystery' part of the plot ended in the middle of the book, and shortly thereafter ended anything remotely interesting. Say what you will about Looney Bertha, but at least she pumped some life into the story.And wasn't it just awesome that Bertha burned the house to the ground and then leaped to her death? Nice exit big girl! I gotta say, she was by far my favorite. Lest we forget, she also managed to mangle Rochester's good looks even more before she bowed out. Now Jane's man looks like a one-eyed, one-armed, flying purple people eater. Of course, she doesn't mind, because now she feels she can be of use to him. Jane, I can tell we will never see eye-to-eye on things, so I'll just let it go. Our friendship was never meant to be. For some, you will forever remain the stoic heroine who finally gets her Happily Ever After. For me, you are just a ninny with bad taste in men. As Adele would say, Adieu. Reader, this review is over."

“I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.”

Okay, so high school Melanie did not appreciate Jane Eyre! But thankfully, many years later, and because of a few friend’s encouragement, I have seen the light and righted my wrongs, because this reread proved to me how much of a masterpiece Jane Eyre truly is. This is a very beloved book, that stars an orphan girl name Jane that is trying to figure out the world around her. She’s searching for worth, for love, and all the middle area in-between. When she is very young, she is forced to live with her not-so-nice aunt, who is absolutely terrible to her. But soon, her aunt sends her off to an all-girls boarding school, but Jane starts to learn who she is and who she wants to be, and after getting her education, she begins to teach at this school that she now considers her home. But at nineteen, she decides that she would like to try to be a governess so that she can travel and see the world that she has learned so much about. Jane gets a job teaching a young girl at Thornfield Hall, but soon meets the master of Thornfield Hall, none other than Mr. Rochester himself. Mr. Rochester is distant, and rude, and a bit grumpy, but the more and more time Jane and him spend together, the more and more they realize they have a lot in common. And they develop quite a strange and unconventional relationship, while many spooky and mysterious things are happening at Thornfield Hall.This book is very protofeminist. Jane has so much rage and anger inside of her, because of the gender roles and expectations that are always set on her. On top of always being sent to places where she is forced to live and be molded into what is expected of her. Jane finally gets to live for herself at Thornfield Hall, and she does so unapologetically. Don’t get me wrong, Jane stands up for herself constantly, and at every age, throughout this story, but seeing her come into her own, and never backing down from her beliefs on what is right, is something so very awe-inspiring.

“I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.”

And so many important themes are in this book! From classism, to marriage, to gender roles, to witchcraft, to slavery, to abuse, to power dynamics, and to so much more. And the things brought up in this book? That was first published in 1847? And I stan one feminist icon, and it’s Charlotte Brontë. I can’t even image what the world thought of this throughout the ages, because it spoke to my very soul in 2018. Seriously, I will forever be in awe of this book and this author, and I truly mean it when I say that she’s a new icon for me. 

“Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agised as in that hour left my lips: for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love.”

I ended up being a sucker for the romantic subplot in this book, too, even though I can see how many terrible, wrong, bad choices the love interest made. But Jane always puts herself first, and even though she wants to be loved more than anything, she will constantly fight for her own place in the world where she lives on her own terms for her own beliefs. Jane loves herself, and in turn it made me love Jane, and this masterpiece of a story. Overall, I fell completely in love with this. This was so intelligently crafted and so expertly woven! And the dark feelings and vibes throughout really makes this such a unique and amazing reading experience. And I think this is a book that I will be able to read and reread over and over for the rest of my life. You also best believe that if I ever have children, this will be required reading once they get a bit older, because this book seriously has an immense amount of power. And I truly believe this is my favorite classic of all-time now. And I never want any woman to feel like a bird trapped in a cage. Trigger and content warnings for bullying, abuse, abandonment, loss of a friend, and use of the slur g*psy.

31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-on-hiatus-but-getting-better-happy-new-2024,Rating 5 out of 5,"I probably read this first when I was about 9 and loved books like What Katy Did at School and the Malory Towers Series. I'm not sure if I loved the books as any little girl might or because I wanted to go away to school to escape my mother/didn't want to go away to school because i would feel abandoned.My mother didn't love me and wanted me to go to boarding school. There was a very good one in the nearest city (I lived in a village) about 13 miles away. My father wouldn't hear of it, he went to work in the city every day and I remember him saying to my mother, how would I feel if I was left there and he came home every day? They had a big row (which I overheard) and my mother suggested a compromise, that I come home at weekends. My father wouldn't go for that either. Then I was supposed to go to Cheltenham Ladies' College, but after a brief interview they declined to have the third member of my family. The other two, cousins, one on my father's and one on my mother's and coincidentally we all have variations of the same first name, had both been expelled. Probably about boys, I forget now, but we were all 'early developers' that way and we weren't like really well-behaved either. Being expelled runs in the family, me too, several times. And my brother but he was expelled from Hebrew school only. He put a firecracker in the headmaster's desk, which my father had also done and also got expelled for but we didn't know it until my brother got into trouble.I didn't want to go and not be with my father who loved me, but I did want to go and get away from my mother and to some extent my younger brother, the golden child who didn't have to do anything, no chores, nothing, and got everything he wanted. That was rubbed in by the housekeeper (we had a live-in housekeeper) who never lost an opportunity to show how much contempt she felt for me. She made my brother's bed, washed his underwear, hung up his clothes and shined his shoes. as she did for my parents, bu tnot me. It wasn't that the chores were onerous, it was that I was the only one in the house excluded from having them done. My father though, had hated boarding school. He was expelled from several. He used to run away. He had a strange upbringing. He also lived in a village, and there were boy cousins (there was only one girl in his generation of a lot of boys) in another village and a lot more in the city. Whenever any of them got into trouble they would just go and stay with an aunt instead of going home. He told me no one really minded who turned up at the dinner table and they were always ready with excuses. So then he would get away with having run away for a couple of days until the school called his mother, my grandmother (who loved me very much), and she would have to track him down and there would be hell to pay.On his third school, he wrote the classic note of novels, I saw it and wished I owned it. He wrote to his mother, ""Don't try to find me, I have gone and joined the army."" She went and got him back and persuaded the school to take him back. He hated school. He wanted to be a farmer and went to Agricultural College rather than university, but on his father's death had to join the family company. So my father was really keen on not sending me away and not forcing me into a career I really didn't want. So in Jane Eyre going to boarding school, I could see myself as the outcast, the one who wasn't accepted, the outcast, the plain girl as my mother was always rubbing in, fat, plain, awful hair, thunderthighs and best dressed in brown, grey, bottle green or navy, never pink, red, or flower prints. So I felt like Jane, I identified with her. Although I was a hair model in my teens and later in films, I never felt more than adequate-looking until my 40s when I started to see myself in a more positive light. I thought if I could get away maybe I could become part of a group, people would like me. I also thought I could get away from the endless berations of my faults and the accompanying beatings.I reread it at about 13 and understood the book much more. I've probably read it, and it's 'prequel', Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea half a dozen times. Jean Rhys was from Dominica, an island I know well. When I was first there her family home in Roseau had become a guest house and that was where I stayed.Not much of a review of an excellent book, but it was why I loved it so much."

34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53067896-amina,Rating 5 out of 5,"This classic beauty reminds you that everyone deserves a love that burns, aches, tears at your soul, opens your heart, and brings pure joy. Even if that love comes with consequences…Jane Eyre; a kindred spirit, full of passion, intelligence, independence, wit, charm, and overall a magnificent human, bringing meaning to the phrase 'character development'.Jane grows up in unfortunate circumstances. Upon the death of her father, she is raised by her vile aunt, who not only disdains Jane’s existence, but is abusive. Locking her up in rooms, ignoring, and taunting her. She is an uncouth human, jealous at her core.
You think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.
When Jane moves to an orphanage, she lives in dreary circumstances, and does not discover better conditions until her last few years. She befriends a dear girl named Helen; a light in her darkness. The one person that treats and cares for Jane, but soon she too dies. Arriving at Thornfield, she takes the role of governess to Mr. Rochester's guardian, Adele. The uncanny bond that forms between Mr. Rochester and Jane happen much later in a peculiar, gorgeous, slow, endearing, passionate, epic way. Jane finally feels she is safe:
 I grieve to leave Thornfield...I have not been trampled on....petrified. I have talked face to face, with what I reverence with what I delight in. I have known you Mr. Rochester...
As the book moves along, we see small moments, hidden gestures, stolen glances, all ebbing towards love. 
 I love you as my own flesh. You-poor and obscure, and small and plain as you are...
A dark secret threatens to destroy the pure, tranquil love and bond between Jane and Mr. Rochester. The perfection of Jane is her ability to not let it break her. She picks her independent soul and moves forward, searching for a morsel of semblance and untrusting happiness. Jane Eyre, a beautifully eloquent story of a woman chasing after her own respect and independence may be the most feminist book to date. Jane doesn't relent. Jane doesn't break. Jane keeps growing, keeps building, keeps evolving. This isn't the typical 19th century novel of a histrionic woman, dramatized, entitled giving into the whims of plainness or a man. This is the story of a woman who steps one foot after another in mud, snow, the trenches of her torture to keep living beyond her pain. 
Do you think that I am a machine? That I can bear it?Do you think because I'm poor, plain, obscure, and littlethat I have no heart? That I'm without soul?I have as much heart as you and as much soul.And if God had given me as much beauty and wealth,I would make it as hard for you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you
When Mr. Rochester asks her who will care for her, she says, ""I will care for myself."" 
I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will

I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself
Here is my truth: I have read many many books. I've liked books, I've adored books, but nothing comes close to the feelings I have towards Jane Eyre. The character development, the arcs, the writing, the drama, the mystery, the romance. Bronte covers every single base, leaving me spellbound.The book was atmospheric, romantic, and mysterious all in one go. I savored every minute, reading only when the mood was perfect. Preferably, a gloomy, rainy day, closely replicating Thornfield in its dark, romantic moments.I love you, Jane Eyre. It’s hard to process you're only a character and not a perfectly real.
You are altogether a human being, Jane? You are certain of that?’'I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.’
Mr. Rochester: a brooding, soul-sacrificing, lover, defining books and period dramas for decades. The ultimate passion, mind-bending desperation he has for Jane, like religion, he revels in her existence. I was reading with gritting teeth as he teased and tested Jane to conjure her inner most thoughts—he felt them too, yet the passion sat between them like an unwelcome guest. 
It is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame.

The beauty of Jane Erye, the novel: an uncanny ability to bring the reader inside Jane's very thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. With wretched beginnings, we carry her burdens and revel in her slightest joys. It's like no other book, worthy of all its accolades.5+ shining, brilliant stars.(Also, if you haven’t watched the latest Jane Eyre [2011] don’t walk, run to stream it! So well done, gorgeous!)"

37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2927182-kristi-siegel,Rating 5 out of 5,"[The picture disappeared which made the comments rather irrelevant.:] …Oh course, Rush Limbaugh is nuts. In December 2007, on a radio show with an audience of 14.5 million, Limbaugh asked this question about the former first lady's presidential prospects, after an incredibly unflattering picture of her had surfaced: ""Will Americans want to watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis? I want you to understand that I'm talking about the evolution of American culture here, and not so much Mrs Clinton,"" Limbaugh told his audience. ""It could be anybody, and it's really not very complicated. Americans are addicted to physical perfection, thanks to Hollywood and thanks to television” (news.com.au).Interestingly and at the same time, we have John McCain, another presidential prospect, who was 71 years old [11 years older than Hillary Clinton:]. Somehow this is different. Society has agreed that women age, and men grow more distinguished. Ah, bullshit. McCain looked plenty old and acted like an irrational coot.However, the more important point is how little we've changed. Women still must be beautiful. And, for the most part, beautiful women still populate contemporary fiction. Consider how brave it was, then, for Charlotte Brontë to insist on a ""plain"" heroine. Brontë emphasizes Eyre's plainness as if challenging the reader to reject her. The impact of presenting such a heroine may be gauged by a male critic (a 19th century Limbaugh) in the Westminister Review (1858), who writes, ""Possibly none of the frauds which are now so much the topic of common remark are so irritating, as that to which the purchaser of a novel is a victim on finding he has only to peruse a narrative of the conduct and sentiments of an ugly lady"" (Showalter 123).Despite ignoring the classic paradigm of either having a beautiful heroine or a heroine--ostensibly plain--who later ""blooms,"" Brontë makes us forget that neither Jane nor Rochester are physically attractive. From the opening scene, Jane's personality dominants the horizon. Having endured the young master's abuse for some time, Jane strikes back and, as punishment for her passion, is banished to the red room. The room is chill, garish, and where Mr. Reed died. Jane's cries to be released are ignored, and she falls into unconsciousness. Although Jane suffers no lasting harm, her thoughts before she is thrust into the room isolate well why her path will be harder than fate had dictated already:I know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child—though equally dependent and friendless—Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.While beauty and its attendant charms would have made Jane’s life easier, it would have lessened her complexity as a character. Again and again, Jane cannot sit back and depend on the free pass beauty often accords, but must choose to give up or to fight her way through. Jane chooses to fight, and it is her passion, wit, and intelligence that make her an unforgettable heroine."

Because, surely, they can't actually be any good. I'm not sure why I've always associated well-known and well-loved classics as such, but I suppose it must be the expectation to love it just as much as the world. It's silly, I know. A person can't be expected to love all books, classic status or not, but still, I wondered if I would enjoy it.Jane Eyre is one of those novels that proves me completely wrong and I'm glad of it. It is not beloved simply due to its age or progressiveness or pretentious nature, but because at its heart it's a damn good book. Lyrical, emotional, and captivating, Brontë makes you beg and plead sweet, emotional reprieve. You hunger for it, but she holds on to it ever so slightly -- not to the point of frustration, but instead leaves a trail of bread crumbs to keep you from starving. And the best part is that you delight in every moment. Brontë made my emotions work for that happily ever after with the irresistible OTP: Jane and Mr. Rochester.At the same time, while I thoroughly enjoyed the romantic aspect, I was also equally intrigued with Jane Eyre's life in general. While at times she lived under horrible circumstances, her resilience was nothing short of admirable. She never let her hardships define her as a person or let it compromise her morals even when she was at her lowest. In the end, her luck does turn around and she finds happiness, which at times I felt was way overdue.Thandie Newton's narration was even better than I expected. Her voice brought the novel to life and at times, I could have sworn several different people narrated instead of just her. It was very apparent that she had a healthy amount of respect for the novel, and her reading, imparted the same into me. It felt like her voice said, ""These words are amazing, this prose is magic, this story enchanting. I'm thrilled to be reading them to you. Let's bask in in Brontë's brilliance together.""  Who could say no to that? I was very impressed and believe listening to this version was the best decision for me. I never was once bored because Newton demanded all my attention.This is the first time that I've read Jane Eyre and I'm glad I did at this point in my life where I'm fully able to appreciate the various themes conveyed. That's not to say I wouldn't have understood certain things, but I'm sure there are lots of books where we come away thinking, ""Wow, this was exactly what I needed right now."" It's even more surprising and intriguing that it's a novel written over 100 years ago that appeals to me even now. Ah, the joys and magic of literature!All the things that I love in a good book was here and more: masterful character development, interesting plot, and OMG, the witty dialogue. I could have read an entire book composed of Jane and Mr. Rochester's banter alone!This book brought me many happy sighs and I'm thrilled to have found a new all-time favorite in a classic tale. Definitely an oldie, but goodie for sure.More reviews and other fantastical things at Cuddlebuggery."

I love Jane, but Charlotte REALLY knows how to write about passion, romantic or otherwise. If Jane’s books are stately minuets in which the smallest gesture has its meaning, Charlotte’s is a spirited, sweeping tango of duty and desire. A perfect blend of passionate romance, gothic mystery, romantic description of nature, social commentary and humor, all rendered in vivid, gorgeous prose. One cannot help to admire Jane Eyre, the little governess who could. She rises above her harsh upbringing to become a governess, poor but ever fiercely independent. Even the promise of love and comfort with the man that she worships is not enough to sway her from the path of integrity. One cannot help to admire Charlotte, who makes her intensely human; a woman of virtue, yet one who is not above jealousy and doubts, and who constantly struggles with the personal cost of her decisions. A deeply felt, and ultimately moving story of love and redemption that will linger long after the last page is turned."
42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson,Rating 2 out of 5,"I understand this book is feminist for its time, but I think that while it opened one door, it simultaneously closed several others. First and foremost, I'll just say that if this were a children's book about a young orphan overcoming guardians who abuse and look down upon her, then it would have been quite enjoyable (and blessedly, half the length). Instead, it was rambly and forced me to sympathize with racist and abusive characters. So although I liked that Jane stood up for herself and was likely a role model for a lot of women, she embodies such classic white feminist ideals that it was difficult for me to translate this book's message into having any sort of modern value. For one, both Jane and Mr. Rochester esteem this book's only mixed race character of color as a beast, a lunatic, and various other words with negative connotation. Also, Mr. Rochester's solution for her insanity is to lock her up in his attic for years. The entire middle of the book that dealt with this conflict handled both of those topics so insensitively. Then, there was the issue that all of the men in this book, despite Jane's supposed strength, were such crybabies about hearing the word no. Usually, this came in the form of rejected marriage proposals that threw men into tantrums. One of the most iconic situations involving this is Mr. Rochester threatening violence on Jane for resisting his advances, then blaming the anger on her that she would cause him to be so impassioned. The entire logic of this being a feminist work was entirely backward for the entire romantic side plot of this because Jane consistently endured his threats, and even by the end of the book when they are equals as she sought for them to be the entire time, she still calls him ""master.""Maybe my reading of this book could have been softened and the questionable parts justified by giving me a deeper reading of the text, but reading it for leisure with no background studies was concerning. When I wasn't slogging through long-winded passages and reading the book out loud to my cats just to combat sheer boredom, I was questioning why people esteem Jane and Mr. Rochester to be such great characters despite their clearly problematic remarks. Maybe I read it too literally and maybe I'm not giving it enough credit for being groundbreaking for its time, but this really wasn't for me. (Unless, like I said, the first half of it was published separately as a standalone. But the romance was definitely not my thing.)"

Because you’re inexperienced and witless to understand the true meaning of extraordinary literature!  So I confess my first waltz when I was young, dumb, clueless and annoying brat in sixteen didn’t go well as it’s planned! I only concentrated the love story part of the book as like other teenager girls who only want to see flying hearts and flowers above their heads! And I honestly disliked Edward Rochester so much! I truly wished Jane get marry with someone else. (Like someone 90210’s Dylan McKay)Can you believe it?  And now when I reread this novel, retaking my journey with a little wiser mind, so many things have changed ( I still think she can find a better candidate for herself but eventually I enjoyed the ending!) I honestly admired the amazing mind of Charlotte Bronte at several times! Because she published this book in 1847 and she pointed at so many sensitive issues in this book including slavery, gender equality, abuse, education, partners’ roles in the marriage. She’s bold, brilliant, a powerful queen of feminism.  This book is a heart wrenching but also truly inspirational story of a young orphan girl: her discovery of her identity, her dreams , her life purposes, her rights to choose the love of her life to spend her life with. She wants to find her own worth, capabilities while chasing her dream to be teacher then a governess. She also searches for the true love and finally she finds it after all those struggles and pain she endured.  After her neglected childhood with her abusive aunt who sends her girls’ boarding school, she starts making new friends and slowly finds her interest to be an educator. She starts to teach at the same school where she considers as her real home and age 19 she decides to become a governess which ends as she starts living at Thornfield Hall where she meets Mr. Rochester: an unhappy, dissatisfied, rude, introverted man who is distanced himself from her.   But as you can guess, more time they start spending together, closer they get and see their common interests as so many haunting, unexplainable things start to occur at the mansion. And eventually Jane leaves Thornfield for living with Rivers family. And her distanced, a man of few words clergy cousin proposes her but ... you know how it ends, don’t you?  But don’t worry! Jane is strong character. She chooses herself at first and she is resilient and wise enough how to choose her true happiness.  The author’s brilliance and remarkably unforgettable characterization earned my five gazillion stars! I’m so happy for stop being dumb teenager and appreciate the true taste of amazing novel!  Here are my some favorite quotes: “I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.”“I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.”“Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs.”“I do not think, sir, you have any right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.”“If all the world hated you and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.”“I am not an angel,' I asserted; 'and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me - for you will not get it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all anticipate.”"

Afterward, it seems that her life lights up when she becomes a teacher and then a housekeeper with a squire. But the man she falls in love with is a prisoner of a terrible secret.All the strength of this novel does not come from the story - which is telling as it is reminiscent of a rosewater story - but from the quality of Charlotte Brontë's writing, the realism of an era, and the character of the characters: Jane's uprightness and intelligence, the ambiguity of one who cannot love her freely, the kindness of her best friend, the perversion of her adoptive family. Qualities that make Jane Eyre a great romance novel."

Her goodness, her humility, her frankness, her passion, her fierce will and her moral compass are all inspiring.And yet, I also love her faults. Jane has a temper, she gets jealous, she fights back, and at times she is too obedient, especially when given orders by overbearing men.What is it about this gothic novel that still makes it a compelling read more than 160 years after it was published? I first came to this story, as I suspect many have, through the various movie and TV versions of the book.* I have now read this book three times, and I get something more out of it with each reading. With each reread, I have paid better attention to what Brontë was saying about women and gender roles; I saw her comments on class and social order; I noticed her thoughts on religion and piety, and the continuum of Christian characters she created — some noble, like St. John, and some who twisted the Bible for their own gain, such as Mr. Brocklehurst and Aunt Reed. (As the daughter of a stern clergyman, I am sure Charlotte had some strong opinions on the ways and people of the church.)Indeed, Brontë had a lot to say about Victorian England, and her characters were all so real and well-drawn that I feel as if I know them. I loved this book, and I will continue to love it. I'm already looking forward to the next time I read it.Update March 2017When Donald was elected U.S. President over Hillary, my heart broke. I was depressed and anxious, and decided to seek comfort from my old friend Jane Eyre. This was the first book I grabbed after the November election, and I savored the reread. I chose Jane because she always tried to do the right thing, despite being forced to deal with people of inferior moral character. Jane's goodness was indeed a comfort, and I was grateful for the companionship.During that post-election reread, one quote in particular struck me as especially relevant:""Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soul has never been loosened or fertilized by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.""First read: February 2009Second read: January 2015Third read: November-December 2016FAVORITE QUOTES""Children can feel, but they cannot analyze their feelings; and if the analysis is particularly effected in thought, they know not how to express the result of the process in words.""""I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek knowledge of life amid its perils.""""It is vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquility; they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally; but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer, and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.""""Most true it is that 'beauty is in the eye of the gazer.' My master's colorless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth — all energy, decision, will — were not beautiful, according to the rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite mastered me — that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them in his. I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously revived, green and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.""""I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man. I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not mad -- as I am now. Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation; they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be.""FOOTNOTE*Since this is the closest thing I have to a blog, I will share my opinions on the best and worst movie adaptations of Jane Eyre. As I see it, casting is everything. It is not enough to take a famous actress, put her in a dowdy gray dress and do her hair in an elaborate bun. No, you have to find the right actress. And if you are lucky enough to find her, then you have to find the right man to play Mr. Rochester. And then, by jove, the two have to have on-screen chemistry. A film version of Jane Eyre with no heat between Jane and Edward is a waste of everyone's time. So here are my rankings of the versions I have seen:ABSOLUTE BEST: 2006 Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens. A fantastic script, incredible actors, steamy chemistry and beautifully filmed. One of my all-time favorite period dramas. 5 starsA FOR EFFORT: 2011 movie with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender. The script moves quickly through the book and changes the original timing to in media res, which works OK. Both actors gave good performances and the mood was very gothic, but the chemistry wasn't as great as with Wilson and Stephens. Mia and Michael were just on slightly different levels. 4 starsSOLID TRY: 1996 Zeffirelli film starring Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt. Fine script and beautifully filmed, the problem with this version is William Hurt, who seems half-asleep. Charlotte is a good Jane, but I wish Franco would have found a more impassioned Mr. Rochester. 3 starsMEH: 1997 movie with Samantha Morton and Ciarán Hinds. A total mismatch of actors. Just frustrating to watch. (Sorry Ciarán, but I loved you in Persuasion and Miss Pettigrew!) 2 starsWORST: 1943 version with Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine. This movie made me cringe. The problem with Orson Welles is that no matter who he's playing, he's always Orson Welles. He is a terrible Mr. Rochester -- he just bellowed and stomped around. I generally enjoy classic Hollywood films, but this was unwatchable. 1 star"

She is a staggering figure of feminist literature, rejecting, or rather, dismissing the notions of social class and many gender roles as she moves upward from her humble beginnings. I was floored by how incredibly enjoyable and poetic this novel was, and how it would resound equally well with audiences of either gender despite being often dismissed by males. With Brontë’s strong feminist themes brilliantly illuminated through her enviable prose and engrossing characters, Jane Eyre truly deserves the title of Classic Novel.One cannot help but fall in love with the character of Jane Eyre. I went into this novel expecting simply a variation of Austen, and was pleasantly surprised. Instead of being focused on the proper workings within proper society, I found a total rejection of these notions in the character of Jane. Still being pleasant and strong willed like Austen’s leads, Jane climbs the ladder of society without stopping to consider her place within it and often criticizes class based distinctions. Although she is merely a governess, she aims for the heart of the ‘Master of the house’, and even after certain events would no longer require her servitude, she is quite insistent upon maintaining employment and an income. She is like a Victorian era punk, totally bent on independence. Mr. Rochester is another lovable character, despite his being a complete pompous ass (which totally won my heart). It is interesting to note that Brontë toys with some of the ideas of romantic plots as well. It is usual for the romantic couple to be attractive (look at Hollywood), yet Brontë is quick and often to point out that neither Jane nor Mr. Rochester are particularly pleasing to the eye, and have a difficult countenance. Brontë’s use of language is widely impressive, having a keen eye for detail and distinction in both natural descriptions and dialogue. It was difficult not to speak like these characters in real life (which would have probably earned me a punch to the mouth), the writing and speech is that infectious. It flows for pages with a strong current without becoming dull in the long descriptive passages and accounts. In short, Brontë writes with the best of them.Fleshing out this story is the theme of sin and forgiveness. While being heavily grounded in religion, Brontë dismisses the standard notions of the day in that regard as well, affording a deeply moral lead that is still able to criticize religious standards and have ambiguous religious beliefs. Jane is quick to judge her actions based on moral principal, but cannot allow it to keep her from being her independent, free-willed self. The most powerful moment of this novel, however, is that only after the sins of her lover are purified in flame and paid in flesh, that the two are able to meld in heavenly bliss. If you haven’t read this, well, let’s just say I’m shaking my head at you like a disappointed father. I jest, but really, give this a try. Brontë is truly a master, and this book gets literally crazy. And for once ‘literally’ truly means literally, you’ll see. Jane Eyre is a wonderful character to follow through this novel and upon completion you will have ‘ acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy’4.5/5"

I clung to those last pages like nothing else - not wanting the story to end - and this is even a reread for me. This goes to show how much I love this book and this journey of Jane. I think what I love the most is exactly the fact that it takes you on an amazing journey, and Jane changes so radically from beginning to end. As a reader, you are rooting for her and your feelings are on their peak from the very first pages when she's being treated so cruelly. Another thing that makes me love this book to pieces is tbe fact that the two main characters are not beauties - the hero and heroine are actually quite ugly, but they find each other - maybe exactly because of that. Finally, we get a story which is not about perfect princesses or handsome princes - this is about common people and that makes it SO MUCH BETTER! I will say that the men in this story raise questions and they are quite unbelievable at times. They behave in such a way that is hard to understand for a modern reader; but I guess that was common back in the days. Nevertheless, that doesn't degrade the book for me in the least. This was a reread for me, but I kept being surprised anyway by the story and the twists and turns. This is a MUST READ and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Beware, because you will be taken on a most wonderful and amazing journey - and good luck! "

Jane Eyre is one of them. I cannot say that this was an easy book to read. But it was a book that I was very enriched by reading. Romance is a genre that is looked down on by many ""sophisticated readers."" Perhaps they would look down on Jane Eyre, but would probably get some eyebrows raised at them. Well Jane Eyre is the archetype for the romance novel. After having read thousands of them, I know a romance novel when I see it, and Jane Eyre does qualify. But it is much more than this. It's a story for the person who wonders why they keep trying to do the right thing, and persevering in life, instead of just taking what they want when they want it. If Jane Eyre had been that sort of person, she would not have gotten her happy ending. Instead, Jane walked away from the thing she wanted most in the world. She almost died doing what she felt in her heart was right. Had the story ended there, I probably would have detested this book. But it doesn't. We see Jane continue to grow and act as the phenomenal person that she was. Although often downtrodden, she is no meek mouse. She has a fighting spirit that keeps her going when others would have laid down and died. But despite being a fighter, she is not a user and abuser. It's hard at times for the difference to be clearly delineated. Well there is no question about Jane's level of strength and intregrity. Although it is made clear several times in this novel, that Jane is no beauty, her soul makes her a beautiful character. Beautiful in a more profound way.There are moments when you feel, how can one person suffer so? But taking the journey, you realize that all Jane's suffering had a purpose. It refined her into a woman who could look beneath and love what others could never love or understand. It made her the woman who could love and heal Rochester.At the same time, Rochester was made for Jane Eyre. He had searched his life for a woman like her, and made quite a few mistakes along the way. And out of love, he was able to let her go when he wanted to keep her. But she came back to him, when he needed her most. Rochester is the hero that formed the archetype for many of my favorites: tortured, scarred, dark, enigmatic, all of those things. Best of all, loving little, plain, ordinary Jane with a fundamental intensity that pours out of the pages of this book into my heart as a reader. Despite his lack of perfection, I could not love him more.Ah, how maudlin I sound. I can't help it. This book moved me to tears. Yet I smiled at the same time. I enjoyed the conversations between Rochester and Jane. There was a heat there, a passion. Yet this book is clean enough to read in Sunday school. That is grand romance. The journey so well expressed, that no sex scenes are needed. It's all there. This novel is also inspirational. Not preachy, in my opinion, but for a believer, one can definitely find spiritual messages in this book. About perseverance, about not wearying about doing good. About the profoundness of God's love. It's all there, but in a narrative that expertly showcases it, not preaching it.I feel I am failing to write the review I want to write for this book. The words do fail me. All I can say is that this book will always be a favorite of mine because of the way it touched my heart and challenged me.  "

Que tus ojos nunca viertan la tormenta de lágrimas hirvientes y amargas que brotaron de los míos. Que nunca tengas que elevar al cielo una plegaria tan desesperada y desoladora como la que en esa hora pronunciaron mis labios. Que nunca sepas, como sabía yo, que eres el instrumento de tortura de la persona que más amas en el mundo».El siglo XIX fue un período de intensos cambios y profundas revoluciones en distintos ámbitos. Comenzaban a extenderse los ferrocarriles por los países y el avance científico era una de las ramas que más mejoras había experimentado.Como era de esperar, la literatura no escapó a todas esas transformaciones. El movimiento del Romanticismo propugnado por Goethe y Schiller a fines del siglo XVIII iba a tener un punto de eclosión a mediados del siguiente dando paso a varias formas literarias y subgéneros que enriquecieron las letras de todos los países.La explosión del Romanticismo se produjo en varios países casi a la par en 1830, cuando los encuentros literarios estaban de moda y la gente se juntaba a leer en amplios salones la incipiente cantidad de literatura que fluía casi sin cesar. Este auge de literatura romántica tuvo su punto más alto en Francia e Inglaterra y se dispersó por Italia, Rusia, España y muchos más. Fue recién promediando 1850 cuando en Francia apareció el Realismo con Flaubert y Balzac a la cabeza cortando con un estilo y forma de leer para pasar a otra totalmente distinta al transformar la subjetividad más apasionada en una objetividad más fría e intencionada.A principio y mediados del siglo XIX, Inglaterra era un hervidero de autores cuyo legado literario nos acompañan aún hasta nuestros días y lo más característico es que en su mayoría eran hombres. Las mujeres tenían un peso e incidencia menor en la literatura tanto en autoría como en el protagonismo de los personajes de ficción, aunque ya habían aparecido autoras que dejarían profundas huellas y darían por sentado su apellido de gran porte y peso. Resalto puntualmente el nombre de Mary Shelley, quien en 1818 daría a luz a una criatura eterna: Frankenstein.Shelley era hija de otra escritora, Mary Wollstonecraft, quien en el siglo anterior había escrito un libro que sentaría las bases de los derechos de la mujer en la sociedad, me refiero a ""Una defensa de los derechos de la mujer"", publicado en 1792 y es a este punto es que yo quería llegar. Las hermanas Brontë estaban destinadas a tomar esta posta para imponer en la literatura que los personajes que mandaban en sus novelas que eran mujeres y no hombres. En ellas demostraron que las mujeres tenían un lugar claro en la sociedad y que sobre todo que podían llegar tener un poder real y verdadero.Los libros que las hermanas Brontë publicaron bajo el seudónimo Bell (Charlotte se transformó en Currer Bell, Anne en Acton Bell y Emily editó su única novela bajo el nombre de Ellis Bell) y no con su propio apellido fueron determinantes para que las mujeres fueran las dueñas de la acción y no simples doncellas perseguidas por la desgracia a la espera de un hombre que las liberara del tormento. Los personajes bronteanos fueron en cierta medida mujeres ""de armas tomar"", de decisión y de carácter férreo que no sucumben ante la adversidad, sino que dan pelea hasta el final.No es un detalle menor que tres novelas de las hermanas Brontë se publicaran en 1847, a saber, ""Cumbres Borrascosas"", de Emily, esta novela, ""Jane Eyre"", de Charlotte y ""Agnes Grey"", de Anne, la menor de las Brontë para nombrar algunos de sus títulos. El caso de la novela ""Vilette"", también de Charlotte con características muy autobiográficas, pero publicada en 1853, luego del éxito de ""Jane Eyre"" es también significativo y se asemeja en cierto modo a esta novela.Y tampoco hay que dejar de mencionar que las verdaderas protagonistas de esas historias son mujeres. Es más, en ""Cumbres Borrascosas"" el protagonismo de Catherine eclipsa por momentos a Heatchliff en intensidad y pasión.Este tipo de historias eran verdaderos desafío al mundo literario de los hombres. Impactaron por la violencia de sus efectos y es digno de destacar que son escritas por mujeres de gran personalidad que complementan lo literario con lo familiar.Charlotte Brontë escribió ""Jane Eyre"" bajo el seudónimo de Currer Bell, pero el éxito de la novela obligó a su editor a sacar a la luz el verdadero nombre de la autora, especialmente luego de las elogiosas críticas del escritor William Thackeray y todo contribuyó para que le llegara el justo reconocimiento. Debo reconocer, además, que no conozco a los personajes de las novelas de Jane Austen ni tampoco leí Anna Karenina de León Tolstoi, ni puedo aventurar si hay conexión con los de las hermanas Brontë porque no es mi estilo opinar de lo que no leí, es por ello que sólo me enfocaré en las novelas que sí pude disfrutar.Jane es una mujer única y especial. Todo lo que le sucede en la vida es afrontado con total estoicidad incluso cuando es niña. Vivir en Gateshead Hall con su malvada tía, la señora Reed y sus primos Georgiana, Eliza y John como menos jerarquía que una simple sirvienta, más allá de ser sobrina directa y una pequeña niña de 10 años, sus durísimos días en el internado de Lowood, donde será objeto de los más crueles castigos, injurias e injusticias durante ocho años hasta su momento de emancipación cuando decide hacerse aún más mujer en la vida, eligiendo convertirse en institutriz de la pequeña Adèle en la mansión de los Fairfax Rochester en Thornfield, hasta su huida para vivenciar las duras experiencias de Moor House junto a St. John Rivers y sus hermanas Mary y Diana. Jane posee una serie de valores inalterables a lo largo de la novela, algo que la hacen fortificar su personalidad, puesto que es valiente, audaz, emprendedora, decidida, arriesgada, tenaz, laboriosa, infatigable y por supuesto, apasionada. Pero también por momentos, su inextricable orgullo o su terquedad excesiva ante ciertas situaciones la obligarán a sufrir todo tipo de pesares y penurias que no voy a descubrir para aquel lector que aún no haya leído el libro. Jane sufre desprecio, castigo, burla, hambre, abandono, miseria, desplantes, engaños y muy pocas alegrías, en parte por los las relaciones con los demás personajes y en parte por erróneas decisiones propias.Su relación con los hombres es, mas allá de ser fuerte un tanto conflictiva, aunque sólo se trate de dos personas de connotaciones totalmente distintas como lo son Edward Rochester y St. John Rivers y es de destacar la inteligencia de la autora para otorgarle a la narración elementos de carácter sobrenatural o giros psicológicos que descolocan al lector (sobre en ciertas escenas de su niñez y en la mansión de Thornfield) que son fundamentales para sostener tanto el suspense de la trama argumental como lo que sucede entre los personajes de la casa.También cabe destacar que da la sensación de que las hermanas Brontë hayan ideado inmortalizar la naturaleza de la localidad en que vivían (me refiero puntualmente a Yorkshire), por especial predilección de resaltar todo lo inhóspito, agreste y desolador de los parajes en que transcurren las historias, tanto la de Emily con sus cumbres ""borrascosas"" como los de Charlotte con la mansión enclavada en Thornfield, que significa literalmente ""campo de espinas"". Parece que las características de esas zonas definieran lo tortuoso de las experiencias que atraviesan los personajes.Charlotte Brontë logró una novela con una historia de vida atrapante de principio a fin, personajes entrañables y únicos, con casi inexistentes puntos flojos (cuesta encontrar alguno realmente), una historia de amor inoxidable, giros inesperados y de corte tenebroso y por sobre todas las cosas, una historia con un claro ejemplo de anticipación de la emancipación femenina que comenzaría a manifestarse recién en el siglo siguiente, puesto que en alguna medida, es gracias a autoras como Jane Austen, Mary Shelley o las hermanas Brontë que la bandera del feminismo protagónico se enarbolara definitivamente para no ser arriada jamás. Y eso, es más que justo."

Then I started to think it over, read literary analysis and historical context. I also watched the exceptional 1944 movie starring Orson Welles and adapted by Aldous Huxley (author of Brave New World) and realized just how great the story is and how well it accomplished major themes of cruelty, especially in religion, and what it means to be loved.That said, I think there’s still room for criticism. The fact that a 90 minute movie can stay virtually 100% true to a 500 page book and leave little out indicates that there’s a lot of excess in the novel. Perhaps it was less irksome to its original readers, when Jane’s moral dilemmas were more serious, but modern readers may struggle with hundreds of pages of worried thoughts over what will seem like trifles.It’s still a page-turner though, and if you can stomach the intermittent boring parts, the juicy moments will grip you to the end. Definitely a must-read classic!"
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4196681-violet-wells,Rating 5 out of 5,"Famously, the most interesting character in Jane Eyre barely gets to say a word. The mad woman in the attic. And oddly, at face value, Bronte seems to imaginatively and emotionally have shunned her. She's largely a piece of Gothic stagecraft. So, Bronte ignores the gagged and shackled woman - perfect symbol of the historical plight of women in general up to that point in time - to concentrate on what might be interpreted as an adolescent romantic wish fulfilment narrative. (Jean Rhys perceived this missed opportunity and wrote an entire novel about her.) But then it's interesting how everyone else in this novel is hell bent on making the rational decision at every turn. Even Jane is continually rationalising her sexual passion. An overload of rationality in any circuit and you're always going to get the unacknowledged screaming prisoner in the attic. It's an oddly, wholly unintended Jungian novel. (I'd argue that one sign of genius is the ability to unintentionally anticipate ideas you haven't consciously formulated). You might say Jane Eyre is the blueprint for all romance fiction and of all the great novels is the one that has spawned the greatest amount of trashy reading matter. In many ways it's the literary teenage girl's dream book. And I thoroughly enjoyed reconnecting with the inner adolescent female. But it's frankly baffling why so many women read nothing but romance novels and therefore pander to that adolescent girl throughout their reading life. I'd give up reading if every novel followed the Jane Eyre blueprint!  It's also interesting that one could make a case that both Jane's suitors are sadistic tyrants. As if for a woman at that time it was simply a question of choosing your poison. Mr Rochester, for all his rather overly manufactured charm, is after all imprisoning a woman he probably had a hand in sending mad. Part of Bronte's wish fulfilment agenda is to see the male physically disabled, as if only then will his tyrannical authority be toppled and he be capable of acknowledging and dramatizing vulnerability. Woolf criticised Bronte for allowing her bitterness at the reprehensible lot of women to seep into her writing and it's true that at the back of romantic fantasising there's almost always a catalyst of bitterness. Bronte ultimately creates a world in which a ""plain"" woman might thrive but in many ways the requisite conditions are as far fetched as you could imagine. It's a fantasy that in the 19th century must have seemed as remote as the planet Mercury.  All that said, this is a triumph of compelling storytelling. However, I was left feeling Emily was the real genius in the family: she was more innovative and went much deeper into the human psyche. Which is why I'm now going to reread Wuthering Heights. "

They were so horrible to her, they hit her, verbally abused her, they just sucked as people! When Jane was so down and seemed to me to have a little bit of a mental breakdown from all that was done to her, a nice man came to visit her and see that she was okay. Mr. Lloyd asked Jane many things and one of them was about her wanting to go to school. These string of questions and kindness from Mr. Lloyd led Jane to be placed in the Lowood school for charity cases. Jane learned so many things from the school. When she first got there though, the school was run by some prickly people that over time either didn't bother her, or they went away. The overseer of the school, a Mr. Brocklehurst, was a complete ass to the girls. I despised him. He would come in spouting stuff about God not liking girls with curls or braids and they could never dress up (not that they had means to do this). He was just a horrid man, he made them get all of their hair cut. Please dude, God doesn't care what girls do with their hair but you should be worrying about where your going to spend eternity! Jane had a wonderful friend named Helen Burn and it broke my heart when she died. A lot of the girls died when the disease came through. The only thing good that came out of this was that some people started paying attention to the school and made sure they started feeding the children right and did good by them. Jane ending up teaching some of the younger girls when she was eighteen until she procured a job teaching a young girl named Adele at Thornfield Hall. I enjoyed reading about Jane's time there even though it went off the rails a little bit when she found out some things about the owner of the house. Mr. Rochester seemed to be a strange man to me, but him and Jane fell in love. They were to be wed... but some stuff got in the way. Some really strange and sad stuff. Jane ended up going away for awhile and was helping out St. John in ministry. Some stuff happened with him and Jane is off again. She comes back to Thornfield Hall and finds out the misery that befell the place. Jane did reunite with some old friends and loves lost.

Unfortunately for me, I must say that I liked it, even if it is not my favourite type of book at all. I love how Charlotte described Jane; a very strong person in every sense, very stubborn (in the good way), and especially how she struggled for the love of her life, how she suffered when she was a child, even a grown-up, how often she cried and she was about to give up... but no, she finally reached happiness after a very long battle against fate and (why not) herself. In my opnion, Charlotte's message was clear: If you have a dream, go for it!This also describes Charlotte's life, so I understand how she could write such a good book.

EDIT - 22/04/2015:-
 The following review was written in paroxysms of adoration which I no longer feel hence a star is being ducked. Now that I have read Wide Sargasso Sea and re-read Wuthering Heights, Rochester and Jane's attraction as characters of high morals has waned in my eyes. But until I write a more balanced critique of this, I refrain from disowning my first impressions.____What do I write about you Jane? Words fall short when I try to. Jane, you are so much a part of me as I am yours.You are so much a part of women who lived in obscurity centuries before Brontë breathed life into you. You are so much a part of women who are alive at present and so much a part of women yet to be born. You are so much a collective chorus of voices than just a single one.You are so much an inexorable force which builds up in intensity over the course of the narrative.You are so much an embodiment of the feminine spirit and not just an ordinary looking, puny little girl of barely twenty with grand world views and ideals.Jane, you are not only the essence of womanhood at its best but the finest specimen of humanity - so refined, so just, so fragile yet so iron-solid. So full of scorn yet so humble. So elegant even in utter distress.Jane, you transcend the boundaries of an era so effortlessly and retain your relevance even today.I don't give any guarantees that reading Jane Eyre (that is if you are still uninitiated) will cure you of misogyny. I do not believe in utopian concepts such as chauvinistic men suddenly giving up on their own delusional views on women and starting to treat them with respect deserving of a human, after reading a book. But it may come very close to achieving that purpose.Then again, I do not expect a well-read man/woman (shocking but women can be misogynists as well) to be a misogynist in the first place. Charlotte Brontë has accorded this immortal literary character with such a voice, such a dignity of bearing, such a sharpness of intellect, such a power of conviction - that absolutely no one can remain unaffected after reading this. Once you get to make the acquaintance of courageous, zealous, outspoken, energetic, intelligent, principled, respectable Jane, you are bound to remember her forever. Rather, Jane will ensure that you do not forget.If you are a woman of integrity, you may see a part of yourself reflected in her sarcastic comebacks, in her sense of humor, in her feelings of rage, in her unapologetic frankness and in her cold refusal to bow down to the wishes of those more powerful than her in terms of wealth or social recognition.Before the term 'feminism' had even come into being, Charlotte Brontë was busy creating an everlasting symbol of feminine power that will stand the test of time with incredible ease and continue to cast its influence on society and literature. Sure Jane Eyre has a romance at its heart - a memorable one at that. Sure it also contains a Gothic mystery. But these are not its only highlights. Jane Eyre is a feminist doctrine in the garb of a novel. Jane Eyre highlights the injustices of class divisions. Jane Eyre contains a subtle indictment of blind religious zealotry and upholds the value of man over God. Jane Eyre lays bare the perversities in self-important men of religion. Jane Eyre criticizes a prejudiced Victorian society and exposes the hollowness of the lives of its affluent but ignorant gentry. And to think Charlotte Brontë wrote this in the middle of the 19th century. The last time I had been this strongly affected by a classic was about 10 years ago, when I had read A Tale of Two Cities for the first time. This is the kind of book whose greatness you cannot try and measure by awarding it a number of stars or even by reviewing it. This is not just one of the finest literary masterpieces ever to come into existence but forms a very important part of the reason why we read, why we prefer to shun the company of people and seek a few precious hours of togetherness with fiction or literature, instead. Dear Ms Brontë, I am late to the party but I have arrived nonetheless. And I cannot thank you enough for bringing me, for bringing 'us' alive in your powerful words. The world and I owe you a debt we can never repay. Oh thank you so very much!P.S.:- This review is glaring in its obvious exclusion of Edward Fairfax Rochester, but that is not for any shortcoming on Mr Rochester's part. Rochester is without a doubt one of the most realistic and engaging literary romantic interests ever created. But I wanted this to be about Jane and only her. Because had Brontë's intention been to bestow equal importance on Jane and Rochester, she would have named this 'Jane and Edward' or something along those lines."

La historia desde el principio es interesante, me encantó la personalidad de Jane Eyre a sus diez años, su manera de pensar era muy distinta a la de sus primos, ella pensaba ¿Por qué tienen el derecho a tratarme diferente cuando soy igual que ellos?, Y tenía tanta razón, ellos creían que por qué Jane no era agraciada y rica merecía ese trato, nunca me cayó bien ni la tía ni los malcriados de sus primos, odie como la trataban. Y al mandarla a la escuela para que aprenda a comportarse como una ""señorita"", siento que Jane nunca perdió su escencia, ni su manera de pensar, pero su comportamiento cambio muchísimo, a lo cual es entendible.Lloré un montón por lo que le pasa a Helena, me encantaba esa nena.Jane después de salir de la escuela, por qué quería conocer nuevos lugares, consigue un trabajo como institutriz en la casa del señor Rochester. Y a mí me encantó ese hombre.No es perfecto, lo describen como feo y gordo, pero me enamore completamente de él, me encantó su actitud con ella, y respecto al gran ""problema"" que pasa entre ellos dos, estuve de acuerdo con Rochester, si no tenía a la mina ahí, la mandaba a un loquero (yo lo hubiese hecho), fue muy amable de su aporte aceptarla y cuidarla.. lo que si no estuve de acuerdo es con que no lo haya dicho antes.Adele es una niña tan querible,al igual que la señora Fairfax, algo que me gustó mucho es con lo que pasa al final con la tía de Jane, una persona que odia toda su vida a otra, incluso hasta en su último respiro seguirá odiando a esa persona y no cambiará por nada en el mundo y eso fue tan real.Lo que me cansaba es que todo el mundo dijera siempre lo mismo de Jane, ""no es tan agraciada, no es bonita"", me molestaba mucho, para mí Jane siempre fue hermosa, ya que su personalidad es atractiva y su manera de pensar. Lo mismo de Rochester, los dos son hermosos y punto. En fin, me encantó cunado Rochester le dice a Jane que le encanta sus ojos de color marrones y Jane dice ""Lector, en realidad tengo los ojos color verdes, pero por el momento por ahí fueron marrones"", AY me encantó, se tomaba el tiempo de explicarnos todo a cada momento, sin saltarse nada.Después del gran problema, si se me hizo algo lenta la lectura hasta que Jane llega con esas personas, lo cual me encantó que ella encontrará a esas personas, esa chica necesitaba cariño de familia y ellos se lo dieron.Y el final, el final fue hermoso, me sorprendió, me encantó, me cautivó... Todo.Amé los celos de Rochester, aunque no estoy muy de acuerdo con lo que hizo Jane, pero ¿Qué otra cosa podría haber hecho?. Al final se volvió independiente como ella siempre lo quiso y con un gran hombre a su lado. Amé las palabras de Rochester y como Jane relataba como terminaron todos sus seres queridos y cuando preguntó. ""Lector, ¿Acaso se olvidaron de Adele?"",.yo dije en mi cabeza ""claro que no"" y ella ahí dice ""yo tampoco"", fue como charlar con alguien, por eso amé la escritura de esta obra.También lo más destacable de todo es el modo de pensar de Jane Eyre, para aquella época era difícil que alguien pensara como ella lo hacía y por eso siempre fue auténtica.Directamente ya sabía que este libro me iba a encantar, y al final me maravilló.No hay más que decir, recomiendo esta obra muchísimo, obviamente haré una relectura cada tanto.Las hermanas Brontë tuvieron un don para la escritura, todas escriben tan diferente, pero cada una con su originalidad. Nunca me podré decidir entre Cumbres Borrascosas y esté, me encantan por igual.Una obra maravillosa. Y sin dudarlo va a estar entre mis mejores lecturas de este año."

The author's use of a pseudonym to get her work published.2. The vivid social commentary by the intelligent and independent protagonist.I read the book years ago when I was 12-13 years old and I didn't understand the significance of the pseudonym until much later. Currer Bell was a male pseudonym. As it turned out Charlotte Brontë's first novel The Professor was never published during her lifetime, and the themes of the second novel made it very clear that it will be even less likely to be published unless a change was made. So, the novel was released as a male perspective of a female mind. “Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, to absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.”Rightly said, Miss Eyre. Striving against prejudice is a central theme of this book. The social commentary involves controversial scenarios of the time: the treatment of women, orphans, the poor, the illegitimate children in society. The book criticizes the Church as an institution and its lack of impact towards creating social harmony. For example, the descriptions of Lowood.But above social stigma rises the question of the choice of a woman. The right to not be judged for her actions when choosing to love or not love. To be able to confront a world face to face without being questioned of her intentions. This, truly, is where the book most struck a chord inside of me as a reader. The fact that Jane refuses to compromise and makes her own choices at will makes the me respect her more as a reader.I also enjoyed the horror elements: the gothic structure of Thornfield and its ghosts and its lacklustre parties and shadowy recesses.Overall, I can safely say that I loved the experience of reading this classic. I've definitely found one of my favorite female protagonists of all time."

I see that even in the book's opening paragraph: ""There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question."" The way Bronte sets the scene of the poor orphan, Jane, evokes Jane's mood and condition perfectly. The feeling that Jane is confined is immediately reinforced by her treatment at the hands of her Reed relatives. She escapes this condition, first to Lowood and then to Thornfield Hall where she becomes a governess. While I like some of the twists in the second half of the book (namely, the madwoman in the attic) I've always been happier with the first half of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. The focus of the second half of the book is on Jane and Rochester's courtship. Not sure what I'm missing, but I don't understand Rochester's appeal. He is cold and arrogant and feels sorry for himself. He does have a passion for Jane, but is she more of an escape from the madwoman in the attic than someone he genuinely cares about? Until the end at least, when Rochester has changed, I'm never quite sure about his love for Jane. Compared to St. John, Rochester is a wonderful prospect. St. John is manipulative, self-serving and does everything he can to bend Jane to his will. What does it say about Jane that she nearly marries him? I do like Jane as a character, but sometimes wonder, most especially with St. John, how she can view him sympathetically. And speaking of sympathy, I am intrigued that, beyond the fact that Rochester is married to her, Jane has little interest in Bertha and Rochester's life together or how Bertha came to be the madwoman in the attic. Though she has sympathy for nearly everyone in the story, Jane has remarkably little (or no) sympathy for this inmate of Thornfield. <>That said (and the meme thrown down), I was pleasantly surprised by how clear and accessible Bronte's writing still is. So even though I wasn't swept up by Jane and Rochester's courtship, I appreciated Bronte's writing and enjoyed the read! "

Since this book is centuries old, I'm gonna spoil the heck out of it right now, so beware.First off, who dresses up as a Gypsy woman just to mess with people's heads?Who fakes an engagement to make another woman jealous?Who then tries to marry said woman when they already have a wife?Who keeps their aforementioned crazy wife in the attic?Who tries to convince the love of their life to stay by their side by recounting all the women they've slept with?Mr. Rochester, that's who. And so Reader, this is why ""WTF Mr. Rochester"" was constantly on my mind. Because seriously, WTF Mr. Rochester.All of that said, I did really enjoy this book, and strangely enough, I really did like Mr. Rochester. Does Jane deserve better? Maybe. Do I totally ship the two of them together? Heck yeah.Jane is straight up savage and I love her for it. She talks back. She's sassy. She's highkey vicious with her responses. She's strong headed. And she definitely has far more tolerance for Mr. Rochester's antics than anyone in the world would ever have.While Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights will always reign supreme in my heart, Charlotte Brontë's novel has also made it pretty high on my list. Now all I have to do is read a book by Anne Brontë and see what happens."

Jane Eyre tells a story of a very likable personage - orphan girl Jane Eyre who, after her parents' deaths lived with her aunt and three cousins who heartily hated her, then at the age of 10 she was sent to a special school-orphanage where after spending 8 years she became a teacher and later a governess at a rich household. As the story progresses we see Jane mature from a young rebellious thing to a fine, upstanding, sweet natured woman, who is headstrong and determined, independent and completely selfless person.Narrated in the first person, Bronte's writing instantly draws the reader into the story, compelling me to keep reading. I found the book incredibly hard to put down. The way the story unfolds is mesmerizing, and it is so intelligently written and absorbing. Having never read any works of Charlotte Brontë before, I was quite skeptical about Jane Eyre at first thinking that this is going to be like another Cinderella story (about a kind orphan girl who is cruelly treated by the people around her and in the end found her happily ever after). Jane is such a likeable character and I am sure most readers identify with her, even today, after its first publication in 1847, her situation and predicaments are something we all experience at some point in our lives. It is no wonder that this story has stood the test of time, and I am sure that in future this fine example of English literature will have its fans as much as it does today.Read Jane Eyre, I urge you, you will not regret it!"

67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena,Rating 5 out of 5,"I get the feeling that Jane Eyre may have ruined future English classics for me. I find it hard to imagine other classics topping this one. This was actually a book that I had no interest in reading because I had been underwhelmed by a Jane Eyre miniseries I watched several years ago. However, so many people have urged me to read this, saying it’s an excellent book, and they weren’t wrong.Jane Eyre is definitely cut from a different cloth from the other classic novel heroines I have come across. She is well-rounded woman of substance, courageous and brave. We follow Jane from her humble beginnings as an abused orphan, both at her Aunt Reed’s house and the boarding school she was subsequently sent to, to her life as a governess. During this period, Jane learns, and is willing to learn, many lessons. I admired her courage and her determination, her desire to be free, despite what little she had or was given, her intelligence, and her love for others.“I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen that then I desired more of the practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.” I was surprised to read passages that highlighted her feminist leanings; it was very timely that I read this book on International Women’s Day. “Nobody knows how many rebellions beside political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a constraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings…”It’s also a love story, featuring the brooding Mr. Rochester. I found him to be quite an interesting character, though I did question a few of his actions. Bronte’s writing style is truly exquisite; she has an adept handle on the language and her prose was like poetry at times. I found it quite charming the way in which she addressed the reader (“dear Reader”) throughout the narrative. It was also interesting to see that Bronte uses semi-colons a lot more often than I do (and I think I use them a lot!).“The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible; impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness. It turns from me; it will not suffer farther scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already made…”I’m so glad to have my own copy of this book as I believe I’ll be reading this one over and over again in the future."

I'll admit, I enjoyed the mystery aspect of the story, but as soon as Jane figures out what's causing strange noises late at night and setting fire to Mr. Rochester's bed, the plot kind of goes down the toilet. The mystery is solved about halfway through the story, so that's a lot of extra plot without much happening. Plus, one of the supporting characters talks almost exclusively in French, and Charlotte Bronte doesn't like translating it, which could be frustrating for someone who can't read French.Read for: 12th grade AP EnglishUPDATE: Does anyone else read ""Hark!

69,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111513919-gabriel,Rating 5 out of 5," Leer Jane Eyre en el siglo XXI es gratificante y más aún para la época en que Charlotte Brontë lo escribió. Es una historia con un personaje femenino que no envejeció nada mal, y que a día de hoy se sostiene intacto. La historia es contada por la misma protagonista y nos sitúa desde que era una niña que compartía vivienda con la esposa de su tío y sus tres hijos; del cómo no pudo seguir viviendo allí porque se negaba a estar al lado de personas que no la querían y la trataban fatal. Luego, pasó al internado Lowood para niñas huérfanas donde abundaba la miseria y los malos tratos por parte de un clérigo fanático e hipócrita con su misma religión; para finalmente a sus dieciocho años convertirse en una institutriz que por voluntad propia trazó su camino llegando a la casa del señor Rochester; donde por fin la verdadera trama tendrá cabida debido a un oscuro secreto que aguarda en Thornfield Hall.Jane es un personaje que desde pequeña se va perfilando como alguien activa, inquieta por adquirir conocimientos y saber más sobre el mundo; alguien bastante despierta y apasionada solo en los momentos donde al fin logra sacar todo lo que lleva dentro. Es una chica que sí, para su época perfectamente pudo ser rebelde, atrevida, respondona y bastante criticada y maltratada por familiares, conocidos y desconocidos. Considerada bestia salvaje, una pequeña demonio, un ser incomprensible y largos etcéteras más, pero es justo allí donde radica su encanto:  salirse del canon al que estaban impuestas todas y cada una de las mujeres de esa época.  Jane Eyre tiene una personalidad fuerte y decidida, no teme en pensar y actuar diferente a la norma convencional. Es alguien que en definitiva me ha conquistado con ese temple firme y arrollador; porque nunca, nunca decae. Siempre sigue la ruta que ella desea con gran tenacidad. A pesar de lo mucho que tenga caídas y picos emocionales (porque también tiene sus debilidades como todo ser humano) por su aspecto físico, su clase social o su condición de intitutriz;  siempre toma sus propias decisiones, aquellas que considera correctas para ella. Y de eso es lo que estoy completamente seguro. Jane fue la que forjó su propio camino, paso a paso; sin seguir la estela que otros/as quisieron marcarle. Y créanme cuando digo que hubieron varios hombres y mujeres que intentaron moldearla, doblegarla, hacerle creer que lo que ellos decían era cierto, pero para suerte y admiración mía, todo fue en vano;  Jane Eyre se mantuvo íntegra desde el comienzo hasta el final, fiel a sus ideales y principios y no a los que la sociedad le marcó desde pequeña. Y sí, es una historia mucho más dulce y sana que Cumbres Borrascosas; con un romance bastante meloso y basado en la igualdad y en el respeto que se profesan los implicados pero no por ello una unión perfecta. Eso sí, es de esas relaciones que te enternecen y que quieres que se lleven a cabo cuanto antes porque no aguantas la espera. Y aunque no es una lectura tan intensa todo el tiempo y que genere sensaciones ambivalentes como la de Emily Brontë;  esta brilla con una protagonista excepcional.  Ah, que es cierto, que ya lo he hecho muy obvio. Pues lo siento, no me importa repetirme hasta el hartazgo, porque me cautivó Jane Eyre y el magnífico viaje que representó conocerla y reconocerla como una mujer libre y dueña de sí misma."

The ladies of the site: TS, Emma, Haïfa, and myself; have found that embarking on more difficult works as a group enhances our enjoyment of the chosen novel tremendously. Chatting with these women daily as we made our way through this book was such a wonderful experience. I can’t wait to do it again!“If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.”My review is a conglomeration of past experiences and current thoughts regarding this book. Instead of rewriting a more detailed review, I have decided to slightly modify the last review I wrote for Jane Eyre, as my feelings haven’t really changed; they’ve merely strengthened.“I care for myself.  The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.”This is my third time reading Jane Eyre, and it’s a book that just seems to get better and better every time I pick it up. There are quite a few classics that I love, but this novel is among my very favorites, tied with Frankenstein for the top spot. Classics are vastly different from modern fiction, and have to be read differently. Now that I understand this fact, reading classics has become much more fulfilling for me. This time around, I was able to buddy read this with three lovely ladies whose opinions were a delight to discuss.“You are original,” said he, “and not timid.  There is something brave in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye.”First of all, the writing is absolutely gorgeous. Charlotte Brontë penned one of the most beautiful novels I’ve ever read. Every word she wrote had purpose and power. In this book we have the story of an orphan girl’s journey from surviving to thriving. Life has dealt her a hard hand, but she handles herself with surprising aplomb and grace through even the hardest situations. Jane is different, and marches to the beat of her own drum. So much so, in fact, that many critics refused to believe a woman had written the book when it was first published. There are times when Jane bends over backwards to try to please those in her life because she is so desperate for the love and family that she never had, but she always has a line that she won’t cross. When pushed too far, Jane always firmly stands her ground and refuses to lose her identity to those who wish to mold her into their ideals. “I am no bird; and no net ensnares me.”That’s one of the most powerful lines I’ve ever read. Jane always remembers her free will and her freedom when faced with those who wish to take those inalienable rights from her, and she always defends those rights. Even in the face of losing that which she yearns for most in the world, she will not be caged or forced to compromise her principles.We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude, His omnipotence, His omnipresence.Another thing I really loved about this book was that Brontë’s faith that shone brightly from the pages. There was much theology and scripture and soul searching in this book. But what I loved most was the fact that it never felt forced or trite. Faith was as much a part of Brontë’s time as breathing, and is portrayed just as naturally. It is the core of Jane and was exquisitely rendered, because it was also the core of Charlotte. I love this quote from the the foreword:Conventionality is not morality.  Self-righteousness is not religion.  To attack the first is not to assail the last.  To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns.And, of course, there’s the romance that this book is most known for. It’s beautiful, but it’s not what stands out to me. While it might be the most famous aspect of the novel, it is not the central theme. In my opinion, Jane Eyre is the story of a girl overcoming hardships and finding herself, and always protecting that identity. Without a doubt, this is in my top five favorite classics. And without a doubt, it is a book made for revisiting.“…if the whole human race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the new.”"

I was ready for a long-winded boarding school experience but it was mercifully short and actually kinda fun and she totally didn't get bullied like I thought she would so it was entertaining! Then she moved into Thornfield and okay, we all knew that romance would ensue, but I didn't realise there was this mystery too and I was so excited, thinking to myself, 'ooooh I got a sneaky ghost story with my dull romance plot! Score!'So anyhoo, it proceeded mostly as expected with the entertaining fun of the mystery, and then when things inevitably went pear-shaped I legit had no freaking clue what was going on. But props to Ms Bronte, because it gave me a solid appreciation for how everything wrapped up and totally converted me.I mean, I think historical romances are probably a little easier for me to appreciate because there's decorum and tact and class as opposed to insta-love and hot steamy explicit scenes. I like the feeling, and the relationship between Jane and Mr Rochester strikes me as being a truly authentic representation of modern love and relationships. It's not about the other person being perfect - just being perfect for you.

This book captivated me, from the integrity and strength of Jane’s character, to the intimacy it builds between you and her. This book feels like a conversation with a friend, a personal diary to read. Jane speaks to you, about her world, about her. The symbolic use of nature, the trials and tribulations of loss and solitude,the emotive and all consuming depiction of love- but for once, with a woman shown as not losing herself to a man, to the need of marriage, but finding it, embracing it, on her terms. A true pursuit of happiness, genuine happiness, in a beautiful story. (I cannot put my love for this book into words. There is so much more I could say. )"
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48056505-piyangie,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is my second reading of Jane Eyer, having read it before when I was a teenager. At the time I understood this book as a romance and was thrilled with the love story of Jane and Mr. Rochester. However, the second reading changed my perspective on the book. It is still basically a love story, but it is also a story of a courageous young girl called ""Jane Eyer"" who is trying to find her place in the world. Narrated by the character herself, the story flows from her orphaned childhood to her adulthood, and from her childhood miseries to a blessed and happy life. Jane tells her story quite methodically and without reservation leaving the readers to form their own opinions on her life. It is fair; Charlotte Bronte should have the freedom to decide on how she should present Jane's story. But this methodical and overcareful presentation made the reading experience less exciting, and at times, boring. The first quarter of the book is more autobiographic. Often I felt as if I were reading Charlotte's own tale than Jane's, especially when reading the school chapters. But once Jane meets Rochester, the story becomes more inviting. The writing is beautiful. I'll give that credit freely to Charlotte. And the carefully organized structure kept the order of the flow of the story. However, the too detailed descriptions of scenery or feelings and thoughts of the characters disturbed the flow of the story, and she took ages to come to a point. As to the characters, I just couldn't like Jane. It is a real pity. Perhaps, it was because of the way she was presented by Charlotte. She was goodhearted, principled, strong, and courageous. All is good. But Charlotte could not hold on to the character traits that she has so carefully portrayed in Jane, making her contradictory numerous times. And I couldn't like Mr. Rochester either. I did pity him for the peculiar state he found himself in, but I could not forgive him for his deceit and possible damage he could almost have done to Jane. Although Rochester did love Jane, his attitude that since Jane is an orphan and has no kin or friend in the world that it was alright to live with him made me question his morals. Then, there was St. John Rivers, Jane's newly found cousin. There were so many contradictions to his character that I hardly understood him. My interpretation of him was that he was a cold, selfish, and manipulative man. But throughout his character, I saw that Charlotte trying to justify his person saying although he has his follies, he is still a good man. I wonder who St. John represented in Charlotte’s real-life that she needed to defend him with such earnestness. It was a good story overall, and Charlotte's writing was beautiful. But for some strange reason, this book did not arouse passionate emotions in the same way it did when I read her sisters' works. I found myself a passive reader for the most part of the book. I liked the book, it was good, but I couldn't love it. Charlotte is no doubt a good writer, but she falls behind her sisters in storytelling."

Sheriff Hamlet is relaxing out in front of the General Store. Suddenly Polonius comes running down the middle of the dirt road at the center of town, waving his hands in the air, shouting ""EVERYBODY RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!! JANE EYRE AND THE BRONTE POSSE IS COMING TO TOWN!!"" The townspeople all scramble out of sight. Store owners pull the shades down. Sheriff Hamlet remains cucumber cool with his legs crossed, reading in the newspaper. According to the article, candidate Marcellus is going on again about “there’s something rotten” in Mayor Claudius’ administration. Then Jane Eyre and the rest of the Brontes appear on horseback at the end of the street coming to halt in a cloud of dust. Jane dismounts and moseys up the middle of the street, spurs jangling, eyes darting back and forth, alert for movement. Sheriff Hamlet gets up, peering at Jane from squinty eyes beneath his hat. He saunters cool-like and deliberate, taking his position at the opposite end of the street. Jane: (menacing) You sheriff round these here parts? Hamlet: (calm) I reckon so. Jane: (calls back to her posse) Well that’s a dandy…Get 'im, Bertha! Suddenly bursting into view, a wild-eyed woman in a charred wedding veil issues forth a shrill war cry, and charges full-speed on her horse towards Hamlet. Unphased, Hamlet stands his ground and puts two fingers to his mouth, whistling loudly. At this signal, Ophelia bursts forth from the saloon doors, foaming at the mouth and waving tulips in her hand. Ophelia: (to Bertha) THESE ARE TULIPS!! THESE ARE FOR TAKING YOU DOWN!!! Bertha, caught completely off guard, is tackled by Ophelia and pulled off her horse. Hitting the ground with a thud, the two are dazed as they roll into a nearby ditch and drown. (the horse runs away) Hamlet: (calm) Fight crazy with crazier, I always say. Jane: (miffed) Well played, Danebag but Mr. Rochester ain’t crazy. Get 'im, Rochester. Mr.Rochester rushes Hamlet at full speed. Again, Hamlet whistles loudly. The ghost of Hamlet’s father suddenly appears, spooking the horse who throws Mr. Rochester crashing to the ground. Jane: (at Hamlet) You bewitched his horse, you stupid Dane!! (to Rochester) Are you all right, my dear? Rochester: (looks pretty beat up, is bruised and laying in a fetal position at the side of the road) I don't think it's fatal, Sweets, but I shall be incapacitated for some time, I believe. Jane: (angered, she draws a gun) Enough foolin' around! She fires off several shots at Hamlet. The bullets seem to travel in slow motion towards the sheriff, who doesn't draw his gun, but instead dodges them, Matrix-style. Jane: (amazed) You didn't even draw your gun! Hamlet: Don't you read any Shakespeare? We never use guns! We're all about poison. (smiles) Did you get your water at that well yonder down the road about a mile? Jane, startled, looks back at the half-consumed flask of water hanging from her horse's saddle. Suddenly, she is overcome with sickness. She grabs at her stomach and falls to a crumpled heap at the ground. Off in the distance, the opening phrase of the theme from ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" plays as Hamlet, with a twinkle in his eye, is heard to remark, “What a piece of work am I.” HAMLET WINS!!"

This is the first time I have read Jane Eyre and this is the first time I’ve read anyone like her. Did I take forever to say ‘hello’ to Jane? Not at all! There couldn’t have been a more better timing since at present, my mind is in perfect harmony with my heart and I’m walking down the line of rationality without many missteps. Kindly don’t consider these words as some kind of vain certitude on my part but rather an admission of those rare times in our lives, no matter how short lived these moments are, when the clouds of confusion and ambiguity makes way for a clear sky of coherence and understanding, mostly about ourselves and sometimes about others and in this blissful state, I met Jane, Jane Eyre, Jane Elliot, Jane Fairfax Rochester and Jane.We hit it off right away. I empathized with her when she was a child, I encouraged her when she was an adolescent and I admired her when she was on the cusp of being a teenage girl and a woman. Everything was taking place in an acceptable manner. But then Mr. Rochester entered the scene and I went weak at the knees. I wanted a perfect love story with a perfectly happy ending. This usually happens whenever I realize that the love in question is true and pure and the hopeless romantic in me can’t bear the thought of any ill fate befalling upon my dear lovers. I’m game for all the crazy twists and turns but something different was happening here and the difference was Jane. I had my doubts about her along with some petty preconceptions and banal expectations but in spite of reading so much about her, a surprise bundled in the myriad layers of words and phrases, both contemporary and archaic was waiting for me in the form of this book. 
 “You are going, Jane?”“I am going, sir.”“You are leaving me?”“Yes.”
One fundamental aspect of this novel was the constant movement of our protagonist. The changes in her life were not courtesy the coming and going of others but it was her, who moved to different places and caught herself in different circumstances which brought the welcome and unwelcome changes that eventually gave the long awaited meaning to her life. As a child, it was an imposition but as the years passed, she attained an understanding of being an individual. This despite the fact that there was an easy and apparently happy road she could have chosen, but that person at the end of that road would have transformed into someone else, someone not Jane. In her quest, she took us, the readers, along with her and made us see the world through her eyes. It was an unpleasant world- unfair, prejudiced, conceited, gothic, but the presence of Jane was redeeming enough. She was real in the world of fakes, an antidote to the poisonous streams of inhumanity and a torchbearer of individuality, feminism, integrity, and independence. What about Love in all this? Especially when Love is all you got? Is this what you’re supposed to proclaim?  I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.That’s precisely what you need to do. You need to care for yourself in order to know yourself, only then you can and should step up on the pedestal of love without compromising your being in any manner and Love! It always finds a way when it is meant to be. As for me, I have found a lifelong companion in Jane. What would Jane think? Had I been a Jane in my life? Do I feel a little guilty for not being a Jane on certain occasions? These are some sample yardstick questions I have saved for myself for the perpetual dilemmas that engulf our lives. I’m sure that their answers would help me in a great way and my kind Jane, my plain Jane, my beautiful Jane will always be there to help because, Dear Readers, Jane is Forever. "

“'I scorn your idea of love,' I could not help saying, as I rose up and stood before him, leaning my back against the rock. 'I scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you offer it.'""
Ah, my dear Jane Eyre. Such fire, such passion she has. A young woman cut from my own cloth and my own heart.I waited far too long to read Charlotte Bronte’s masterwork of gothic fiction. Jane Eyre is brilliant – really, truly it is. It’s groundbreaking, too, in that it’s one of our earliest works of feminist fiction, what with Jane fighting the patriarchy and social hierarchy in order to achieve equality and independence. And with the book being first published back in 1847, Bronte was clearly writing ahead of her time.I’m well aware there isn’t much I can say about the novel that hasn’t been said before. It’s a classic for a reason, and it’s been analyzed forwards and backwards, sideways and upside down. So I’ll instead share a few thoughts on why I adore Jane as a character and why she is now on my shortlist of favorite fictional feminists.For a woman who never knew love as a child to have the fortitude to walk away from the man she loves because of principle, because he lied to and manipulated her; to instead choose homelessness and starvation over a pleasurable life with him – that’s strength. To later refuse a loveless marriage of duty and security, even when her Christian faith and the guilt of God is hung over her head – that’s strength. And though she does return to Mr. Rochester, as we all know, it’s on her terms and of her own doing, and only after he admits his wrongs.For refusing to accept less in life, in love, and in the pursuit of happiness, that is why I love Jane."

I knew there was a copy of Jane Eyre on my bookshelf. 6. There was also an audiobook available on my library app. 7. The rest, as they say, is history. But, man oh man oh man, am I glad I accidentally found myself here! I don’t think I would have read Jane Eyre otherwise, and by all of these random events and my fate bestowed to me by the universe, I’ve finished, and absolutely loved, this wonderful book! I found myself all caught up in Jane’s journey from manor to manor, family to family, rags to riches kind of, all of it. The writing is fantastic! It’s got that 19th century style but is still very, very readable. They don’t write books like this anymore. I was very pleasantly surprised by this, and I’m so glad I took a shot on something out of my wheelhouse. Now I can read that Saragasso Sea book, Wuthering Heights, Pride and Prejudice! My wife is thrilled because she thinks she can capitalize on this moment and get me to watch Downton Abbey! I don’t know.if I’m ready to go that far yet!

It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.Jane Eyre has a bit of everything you would want in a Victorian-era novel. It’s gothic, it comments on social class, and it gets a bit freaky with fortune tellers and omens and a dash of the supernatural. I found it to be less stilted and more plot-driven and enjoyable than most novels from that time. There’s an impressive amount of feminism in Jane Eyre too (see, for one example, the quotation above). Jane strives to find balance between her passion and her independence, between her desire to marry and her fear of what it would do to her (symbolized, perhaps, by a certain character I will not spoil here). She would rather be alone for the right reasons than with someone for the wrong ones. It is only when she can have a truly equal marriage that she can have a truly happy marriage.I did not love every aspect of the book. I thought it dragged in a few places (I’m looking at you, St. John), and some of the Christianity meditations were a bit heavy for my taste (the last two words of the book are literally “Lord Jesus”). And there’s one place where Jane casually exclaims “What do I want with half your estate? Do you think I’m a Jew usurer seeking good investment in land?” Yikes. Still, Jane Eyre is a timeless classic for a reason. Recommended."

As I was reading, my reaction was to fling my own pen aside. I drew a line at breaking my fingers. Besides, she would tell me that pain is part of it. Keep on writing. This is the most honest account of desire that I've had the privilege to read and wish to write. Movies try to come close. Some do better than others. But the book surpasses them all. How? By taking the time to share Jane's thoughts, the passion has a chance to build to its full force. Sheet by sheet of this book throbs.

82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/138218419-jimena,Rating 5 out of 5,"Una de las mejores novelas de la era victoriana y de la literatura en general. Jane Eyre es una historia que envuelve y abruma tanto por lo espléndidamente narrada que se halla como por la complejidad mental y emocional de sus personajes que desafían en incontables ocasiones los convencionalismos sociales de la época. Es quizá esta rebeldía latente lo que dota a la obra de un encanto atemporal.Jane Eyre, nuestra protagonista, se nos presenta en primera instancia como una niña huérfana bajo la tutela de una tía que la desprecia y que acaba deshaciéndose de ella al enviarla pupila a un colegio donde lejos de despegarse de las nociones de carencia pasará a atestiguarlas como nunca. Esta primera parte tiene un tono marcado por la soledad y la búsqueda de afecto, el temperamento indómito de una niña, el miedo casi supersticioso al mundo y la brusquedad de un entorno azotado por la enfermedad y la muerte. La autora consigue crear una atmósfera dura y ciertamente devastadora en la que brillan, por momentos, ciertos milagros como la amistad.Pero lejos de limitarse en las penurias o inquietudes de una niña, la obra avanza para que sigamos a Jane durante su juventud y madurez mientras leemos, en una narración en primera persona, su búsqueda de independencia que la aleja de la institución donde creció y la lleva al sitio donde la espera un insólito amor que la hará cuestionarse todo lo que concibió sobre la sociedad y sobre sí misma. Un amor truncado por circunstancias ajenas a ella que demandará decisiones sacrificadas que condicionarán una vez más el rumbo. Aun así, bajo el peso de un destino que parece modificarse constantemente y la dura luz de una sociedad donde las posibilidades de felicidad parecen ligadas al nombre y el estatus, Jane Eyre se rehusará a dejar que otros decidan por ella o la encarcelen en voluntades que van contra sus principios.Dotada de una gran decisión, de un juicio justo aunque critico, de una irrevocable percepción de sí misma, de un hábil intelecto y una mordaz capacidad para el diálogo, Jane Eyre conquistará al señor Rochester pero también a sus lectores. Es una protagonista magnífica, rica en matices, de fuerte temperamento pero de un admirable control sobre su expresión. En sus argumentos y contraargumentos con Rochester presenciamos no sólo el nacimiento del amor y las limitaciones que les impone la época sino que nos deleitamos en el humor insólito que nos ofrecen.Jane Eyre es, sin dudas, un clásico. Quizá por la fuerza de su protagonista, el deleite que representa el romance o como nos seducen sus giros inesperados. Quizá por la crítica que alza contra los prejuicios de una sociedad que margina, divide y aplasta. Quizá por lo peculiar que resulta poder acompañar a Jane desde la inocencia de la infancia hasta la madurez. Quizá por la espléndida e incomparable pluma de su autora. Quizá por todo lo anterior y por algo adicional que esta lectora es incapaz de capturar en palabras pero Jane Eyre es, ciertamente, una experiencia avasalladora e inolvidable."

84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,Rating 5 out of 5,"The funny thing about this novel is not how enlightened it is for the time period, because it really isn't all that enlightened, right Mr. Rochester? How's that first wife hanging in the attic? Or how closely aligned to modern ideas of equality between the sexes and finding an equitable arrangement between them it is, because it only happens to conform to the standards of romantic literature of the time, where happy endings happen. Windfall out of nowhere? Really? Trope, much? And how does that subvert anything except as to put Janet on an *externally* equal footing? Being balanced in monies and station is not the same thing as having a true meeting of minds and hearts.Fortunately for us, all the plot twists are secondary to the one thing that she and Mr. Rochester have in common, and that is a true meeting of minds and hearts, and while the idiot manages to really crap it up, it seems that only an enormous act of god or authorship or pandering to trope could possibly put Jane back into a position of strength where she can tell the rest of the world to **** off and do what she wanted to do, originally.And that's what this novel is really about. It's not about the plot. It's about the internal character of Jane Eyre. She's wholly her own person, and that, more than anything, is more subversive than anything else in this novel. She's not bucking the male-dominated world. She's not setting off to have adventures. She's not even telling people off unless they push her to it, and she has no qualms about being subservient or going dropping all of her happiness in a big pile and storming off to hold to her personal ethics.That's the point. She knows herself. She knows her limits. She knows what she wants. And even if she doesn't always know how to get what she wants, she knows what she'll settle for and precisely what she won't settle for. She follows her heart, her own judgement, and nothing that anyone might ever say to her would ever change that.There's plenty in this novel that might annoy or outrage modern readers, of course, but this one simple fact about Jane is what lets it transcend all other considerations, or indeed, time itself.This is a great novel. :)"

I have listened to Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, narrated by Thandiwe Newton. Having listened to it with joy, I can say that Jane Eyre is the kindest woman I have come to. Everything that had happened to her didn't make her bitter else. She was smooth and delicate throughout all good and bad days. Her childhood, and upbringing, made her such a good person. She found her peaceful days with her beloved one."

88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8836060-michelle,Rating 5 out of 5,"There is something deeply attractive about gothic romance. Part of its appeal is the sense of intractable eroticism squirming to escape from just beneath the surface. The tension in the genre is often generated by a virginal girl's attraction to a dangerous man. The more pitiful and helpless the heroine --the better, but she must also be proud and virtuous, brave and idealistic. Her attraction to the ominous hero must be based on pity, not fear. He must deserve her idealism. Charlotte's Bronte's “Jane Eyre”, in my opinion, is among the greatest of gothic novels, a page turner of such startling power, it leaves its pale latter-day imitators like “Twilight” flopping for air like a stranded fish. To be sure, the dark hero of the story, Edward Rochester, is not a vampire, but that's only a technicality. “Jane Eyre” is about how a poor, unloved, and unattractive orphan uses her awesome personality to win over a wealthy sort-of-aristocrat, and live happily ever after. But the novel is far from your typical Harlequin romance. Way far! By ""awesome personality"", I mean she is blunt and somewhat annoyingly obsessed with duty. It’s also important to mention that the sort-of-aristocrat is: mean, ugly, and comes with more baggage than a first class international flight would allow. And the happily ever after? That comes in the last few pages of a very long, and very messed-up (think psychopathic mind games and imprisoned people in the attic) courtship. But fear not! It's still a pretty compelling read for a book that was published in the bygone days of 1847. Either you know the plot or not, its secret is a red herring with all the significance of a scuba gear in the desert. It functions only to provide Rochester with an honorable reason to propose a dishonorable thing, and thus preserve the moral standards of the time. I think the novel is actually about forbidden sexual attraction on both sides, and its interest is in the tension of Jane and Rochester as they desire sex but deny themselves. Much of the power comes from repressed emotions, and perhaps Charlotte Bronte was writing in code about the feelings nice women of her time were not supposed to feel. This just triggers my thirst-for-voyeurism and, I would like to think, so does everyone else’s! Add in the madness, disability, missionaries, and a tasty sprinkle of the gothic into the mix, and I was hooked! In fact, I got kind of obsessed with all the gory details after a while.Of course, apart from all this, the book also offers something else: a tale about “The Man” getting you down. Over and over, Jane’s put into situations where she’s too young, too poor, or too powerless to win, but she has to try anyway. And we all know about that. We’ve all been the kid who was picked on by some random adult like Mrs. Reed or Mr. Brocklehurst, or your fourth-grade math teacher just because that person has a stick up their you-know-what. We’ve all had to accept that everyone would believe the adults just because they are adults, so they get away with it. Maybe some of us have also been the young employee who gets pressured to do something immoral or just to work late again by our boss. Or the girlfriend who finds out that her boyfriend’s taking someone else out on Friday night. That ""someone else"" might not be an insane vampiric arsonist, but hey, parallels only go so far. Even if you've never spent time as a governess in a moldering mansion, you've likely felt puny and insignificant at some point in your life. And there is nothing more relatable than watching the underdog get kicked around... and nothing more satisfying than watching her triumph.Overall, I consider “Jane Eyre” one of my favorite books of all time. It can be painfully long, but it is a beautiful story written in a time in which language was truly a work of art."

JANE EYRESetting: World Courts buildings, Den Haag, Netherlands; a closed-session hearing...Judge: I have agreed to hear this case, but I must admit to both parties that we are in uncharted legal territory. Both parties must understand that I have very little administrative guidance with which to make a decision. This is a very public dispute, and the fate of a nation rests on my decision, so my decision- which is binding and final- will rest heavily on what I think is in the best interests of the Danish people. Agreed?(all parties nod in agreement)Judge: (to Hamlet) Prince Hamlet, I must admit: I’m astonished that you come to be in my court today. I thought you were dead by poison from the blade of Laertes.Hamlet: A sub-lethal dose, it turns out, your Honor.Judge: (nodding) Well, during your period of coma and internment in your family mausoleum, young Fortinbras here claimed your kingdom, citing the documents we reviewed earlier. (pauses to read some legal notes) Some of the changes made under Fortinbras’ rule have been very popular with the Danish public. The court is reluctant to overturn his claim.(to Fortinbras) And who is this woman sitting with you?Fortinbras: Your Honor, this is Jane Eyre, Governess of the Rochester Bank of London- which is the IMF’s (International Monetary Fund’s) appointed agent for the establishment of a Danish central bank, and the restructuring of the Danish economy.Jane Eyre: (nodding deferentially) Your Honor..Judge: (nods) My lady…Hamlet: Your Honor, the creation of that central bank you mention is a point I’d like to address immediately. The gold coin of my father’s realm has been stable for centuries. The fiat notes Ms Eyre and her cronies would print bear no true value. (produces chart) This chart here shows how every fiat currency in history has either failed, or is in the process of failing. (motions to chart)every fiat currency has failedJudge: (looks over his glasses at the chart, then over to Jane) This seems quite compelling, Ms. Eyre. What have you to say about this?Jane Eyre: (condescending) A modern, elastic currency is the only way to capitalize economic growth in Prince Hamlet’s backward little country. His people are living in the… well at least the 16th century, if not earlier.Hamlet: Yes, it’s true, we haven’t had the Agricultural Revolution yet, but we need that to happen before we can industrialize… in order to free up manpower off the farms.Fortinbras: (sniffing derisively) Ridiculous! The World Bank has already done an analysis of the Danish economy, and endorses our plans to industrialize immediately. We plan to get the necessary human by importing food and forcing displaced farm labor into the cities. By importing medical advances as well, we can also extend the population‘s lifespan, which will produce more slaves, er, labor force.Judge: (conflicted) Medical advances are a good thing…Jane Eyre: (triumphant) Yes, for starters, the Rochester Bank of England has begun construction of the Ophelia Memorial State Mental Hospital in downtown Elsinore.Hamlet: (indignant) To be administered by a Mrs. Poole - a close personal associate of Ms. Eyre’s, it turns out! This is but one of many examples of the cronyism and corruption this IMF restructuring has brought to Denmark’s fair shores!Jane Eyre: (with a subtle nod and wink to the Judge) Naturally, the IMF reserves the right to appoint able and vetted candidates of its own choosing, to oversee its projects…Hamlet: (pointing at Fortinbras) And this scoundrel would enslave my subjects in servitude of debt… borrowing from the World Bank to fund a massive hydroelectric power plant!Judge: Hydroelectric power? That sounds good to me. It’s infrastructure.Hamlet: Infrastructure is great, but how about something relevant to the local economy? We aren’t industrialized yet… what do we need all that electricity for?Jane Eyre: RBM (Rochester Business Machines) wants to build a factory in Denmark for the manufacture of circuit boards…Hamlet: (standing up) Yes, at slave wages! Why not grow local businesses? Why not build port facilities to help the already-extant Danish fishing industry? Why not facilitate domestic trade by building roads and railways? Why not improve public health by building a solid waste treatment plant?(motioning in Fortinbras’ general direction) THIS sort of infrastructure mainly benefits IMF cronies, who move in and exploit my subjects!Fortinbras: (offended) “Solid waste”? How lewd!Jane Eyre: (irritated) Judge, this Prince is obviously an insular autocrat who wishes to keep his people in the Stone… er, Elizabethan Age! His resistance to our humanitarian assistance is an injustice to the Danish people, a threat to free trade, and a refusal to peaceably enter into to the community of modern, enlightened nations. He’s a terrorist!Judge: (appalled) A terrorist?!??Jane Eyre: (meekly) No? Um… well, I meant figuratively speaking. An “intellectual terrorist”, if you will.Hamlet: (pleading to Judge) My kingdom merely wishes to neither a borrower nor a lender be.Judge: (thinks for a second) Hmmm… yes… because loan oft loses both itself and friend.(Hamlet nods and smiles)Judge and Hamlet in unison: And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry!Judge: (standing up) YES!!

91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30910845-vessey,Rating 5 out of 5,"SPOILERSI dedicate this review to my dear friend Jeffrey. jeffrey, you are incredible friend and a writer and you should never, ever change.Jane and Mr. RochesterMore than once I have come across criticism on Charlotte Bronte for fully failing to understand Jane Austen. Charlotte declares her incapable of passion. And while I cannot agree with this assessment, after my second reading of ‘Jane Eyre’ I do understand why someone like Chatlotte Bronte sees someone like Jane Austen this way. If Lizzie Bennet is a breath fresh air, charming and witty, Jane is force of nature. In the face of a storm Lizzie will be next to you, encouraging you and consoling you, while Jane will grab you by the hands, look you in the eyes and tell you “It’s over. You’re going down. Face it and do it right” Jane carries herself through light and darkness in equally graceful way. I may disagree with some of her views, yet, I am completely enthralled and mesmerized by her strength, by her determination to fight for herself, and the passion with which she defends her beliefs, regardless of whether I agree with them or not.""I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will.""Jane proved to me that freedom and free will are not the same thing. Does the slave, the captive, the sick one, the lonely one, have a free will? We are all captives in some way, we are dependant and we all suffer. Some more than others. Free will doesn’t go away with freedom. No walls, no humiliations and atrocities can devour it. I shall quote my friend Hades “Courage doesn’t always roar. Sometimes courage is the quiet voice at the end of the day saying, ‘I will try again tomorrow.’ Even in the face of most horrendous circumstances we have the choice, the free will, to decide whether we shall let our identity, our core, the sense of meaning, burn out along with our happiness, or we shall keep remembering that there is always tomorrow. Jane remembers, Jane hopes, Jane believes. Jane cares. I will never understand those who consider Catherine the personification of passion and free human spirit, and Jane just a meek, boring, insipid girl. Catherine is passionate about nothing and no one else but Heathcliff. And even this single source of passion doesn’t prove strong enough. She lets go of him and voluntarily confines herself into miserable marriage and devotes her existence to a life of bland luxury, lies and petty rivalries that make neither her, nor anyone close to her happy. This isn’t the face of passion and freedom. Jane is passionate about Mr. Rochester, about women's position, moral, religion, education. About people and the world in general. She has a really big scope. One that Catherine lacks. She knows herself well enough to know that being entraped in a relationship that goes against her instincts would ruin her. It is people endowed with passion and bravery that dare to throw away the shroud of the common, to peel the veneer and see what’s inside. She breaks the rules. She cares nothing for customs, social norms and others’ opinion. Her conscience is her only guide. Jane is adventurer. She longs for “the wind to howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise to clamour”.""I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold. Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes.""And this longing makes her to break free from prejudice, to remember that “women feel just as men feel; It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.” It makes her brave enough to have a relationship with an older, prominent, enigmatic, sarcastic, dominant, demanding man, even though many who have been victims of suppression and abuse would see such position as just another of its faces. Yet, she gives into it. She dares explore the forbidden territory, to jump in the deep without a safety net, and knowing that if it fails, there will be a hell to pay. At the time having a relationship with the boss wasn’t as easy as it is today.""My eyes were drawn involuntarily to his face; I could not keep them under control. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking, - a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.""Temptation. It is a powerful force and for a woman like Jane, endowed with rare sensitivity and sensuality, it is an even greater one. Jane is modest and calm, but on the inside she is full of ""life, fire, feeling”. And she is confident enough to not feel the need to demonstrate and parade her sexuality. As Marguerite Duras says in “The Lover”, “You didn’t have to attract desire. Either it was in the woman who aroused it or it didn’t exist”. Just like she doesn’t feel the need to prove how strong she is. Her mild, calm nature is not a sign of resignation, but a sign of deep inner peace. Fervour and boldness are not the only weapons one might possess. Jane isn’t about effects, but results. She speaks little and calmly, but smartly. Two quiet words, said in the right way and at the right time, have a bigger effect than the most intense and colorful declaration. Everyone can attract attention by being bold and flirtatious, everyone can defend themselves by using strong language and even force. But how many of us can achieve those things without even trying? Jane’s strength and beauty are deeply intrinsic. They are part of her, and not something she needs to evoke. They provoke fear in the cruel, sanctimonious, narrow-minded Mrs. Reid and Mr. Brocklehurst, mollify the innate coarseness of Betsy, gain the favour of Mirss Temple, Diana and Mary Rivers, and the affection and respect of Edward Rochester and John Rivers. I shall quote Mr. Rochester himself.""To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I find out they have neither souls nor hearts - when they open to me a perspective of flatness, triviality, and imbecility, coarseness, and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break - at once supple and stable, tractable and consistent - I am ever tender and true.""He understands and describes her character perfectly.With all said, Jane isn’t perfect. She has her inner struggles. She questions her principles, she suffers the temptations and dilemmas we all do. It takes her a lot to learn to handle her strong emotions. Both negative and positive. When she is faced with the same dilemma that haunts the protagonist of “Notes From the Underground”,“Which is better – cheap happiness or lofty suffering?”she is very tempted to choose what she perceives to be an immoral act, disregard of her most important values. Her inner struggle at those moments will stay with me. It touched me very deeply. ""I have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in, - with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have known you and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death.""In the end she adheres to her chosen path. But despite her choice of ”lofty suffering”, Jane is not judgmental and self-righteous. She proves exactly how gentle her heart is and how deep her mind when she is faced with Mr. Rochester point of view regarding relationships and the sanctity of marriage. She doesn’t share his view, yet, she isn’t scandalized, indignant or angry. She actually sees the sense in what he tells her, despite not agreeing to it. I think it is rare to be able to understand and accept an opposite point of view without sharing it. Time and experience have taught me that two opposite views can be equally valid and truthful. This is a woman able to see nuances. All said about Jane’s depth can be said about Edward Rochester too. I will never forget these words:""Never was anything at once so frail and so indomitable. I could bend her with my finger and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed her? Consider that eye, defying me, with more than courage - with a stern triumph. It is you, spirit - with will and energy, and virtue and purity - that I want: not alone your brittle frame.""It only shows how well they know and understand each other. (Unlike Heathcliff and Cathy) The harmony they find in their disharmony proves the veracity of his earlier words:""It is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame. And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I’ve a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you, - you’d forget me.""The first sentence anyway. As the plot progresses, we see that, like in every great love story, nobody forgets no one. The way they bear their separation only supports his claim about the deep affinity between them. (sighing)Jane and John RiversThe other austere, dominant male presence in Jane’s life. He must be one of the most fascinating characters I have come across. He may not be the man you would want as a best friend or to marry to, but I find him incredibly exciting and thought provoking. I shall quote myself. Here’s what I say in my review of “Inferno””I would always choose the sinner who sins, but also forgives, over the saint who never sins, but never forgives either”The juxtaposition between John Rivers and Edward Rochester really instills life into those words. Charlotte Bronte seems to have believed the same thing, judging by the way she has constructed those two characters. And Jane somehow balances their features in herself. She possesses some of the convictions and prejudices of John Rivers. She is deeply religious and despite generally being able to see nuances, in some aspects, just like his, her view is too black and white. She too is used to very simple, moderate life, she too feels the need to help others. Only, unlike him, she realizes that in some aspects the best way to take care of others is to, first and foremost, take care of yourself. And this is where once again we witness her ability and willingness to see nuances. Unlike John Rivers, she realizes that when an idea, no matter how noble, turns into an obsession, might turn the devotee into someone as – and even more – dangerous than many egotists, opportunists and criminals out there. Rochester too is an austere, harsh man, but unlike John Rivers, he understands the other side too. He’s also full of love and tenderness and generosity. Not John Rivers, though. ""What struggle there was in him between Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams scintillated in his eyes, and strange shadows passed over his face. He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views. It is better for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in his progress, he should trample them down""John Rivers, albeit good and great man – as Jane herself refers to him – is tainted by the fatal weakness of seeing people as just a big herd and himself as the shepherd who needs to lead and support it. He fails to see them as individual human beings, which is good neither for them, nor for himself. He is ready to sacrifice himself and everyone else he deems necessary to achieve his grand dream. He has a big heart, but a narrow scope. He struggles with every genuine feeling that comes to him.""You are original, and not timid. There is something brave in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions. I declare, the convulsion of the soul. That is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I am - a cold hard man.""He is fanatic to the very core of his being and so lacking of confidence and self-esteem that he believes himself worthless without religion. To Jane religion is a dear friend helping her to keep her hope alive and make hard choices. It is essential part of her personality, but she sees it as something separated from her. She had her marvelous qualities even before turning to it. However, John Rivers sees his religious self as the only self that is of any worth. He affirms nothing else.""You have taken my confidence by storm, and now it is much at your service. I am simply, in my original state - stripped of that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity - a cold, hard, ambitious man. My ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher - insatiable. I watch you with interest, but not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you still suffer.""His words show that he too is possessed by a deep passion. But it is a cold flame that inflames it. His goal is noble, but not his ways. He rejects his individuality and that of others, the idea of happiness and self-indulgence. He forgets that every love is first and foremost love for the self. It is from this love that our love for others emanates. If we give up on ourselves, we give up on everyone else. If all you do is just give and give and sacrifice and sacrifice yourself, one day you will find that you have run out of substance and you have nothing left to give. And you will be gone, unable to help anyone with anything. And it will happen quickly. As it really does happen with him. But, as Jane herself proves, if you use your goodness and generosity sparingly enough and not forget yourself, you will be able to preserve yourself and therefore help others for a longer period and in a more quality way. Sometimes the best way to be strong is to let yourself be weak. I choose weak, but long-burning candle over bright and short-burning one. Jane is not as free-thinking as Rochester in some regards, but she does share his warmth, his willingness to forgive, the flexibility of his mind, his dream of happy and content life. She admits her own – and his – importance. It is always hard to decide how much to give to others and how much to keep to ourselves. It’s the hardest balance to keep. The one between the self and the world.With all said, I do believe that John Rivers, cold as he was, in his own way did love her. But he was too absorbed by his overblown idea of humanity and sacrifice and his refusal to see people as anything else than helpless victims and himself and Jane as the necessary sacrifice laid on the sacred alter and soon to be consumed. For awhile Jane is tempted. For awhile he is as big a temptation as Rochester. In the end though her spirit prevails, she breaks free, she remembers who she truly is and whom she needs to be with. The ending brought me so much happiness. I still stand by my claim that Mr. Rochester is the sweetest marshmallow of a man I have come across. And Jane agrees with me. Or, maybe I should say, I agree with her. This is one of my most favourite novels and, in some ways, the favourite. It was the book that made me realize that simplicity and depth don’t mutually exclude each other. It is a simple story, but it tells us so much. And Jane herself, she doesn’t possess the grayness we all appreciate so much in characters and consider to be making them deeper and more interesting. In this regard Jane is not complex – she is perfectly good, kind and amiable girl – but she is a deep character that speaks to me from the distance of 178 years. And I hear her voice. She exhorts me to be compassionate, to be strong in the face of adversity, to be equally kind to myself and others, to love myself and others willingly and openly, without shame, without regret, without reserve. She remains a quiet power in my consciousness that I will never separate with. Thank you, Jane.Read count: 2P.S. My only regret is that I didn’t provide Mr. Rochester with enough attention. I feel that I should have explored his character more thoroughly, so this review will probably go through a substantial redaction at some point. Otherwise it was a really nice experience."
92,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-dave-schaafsma,Rating 5 out of 5,"Jane, Jane, Jane!!“I would always rather be happy than dignified.” ""I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being, with an independent will; which I now exert to leave you.” In spite of and in part because of its nineteenth-century gothic romantic roots, Jane Eyre remains one of the great novels, principally because it features one of the best characters of all time, a woman that fairly leaps off the page, a feminist for all ages. I am in agreement with Cecily in her fine review that this book is less a book of romance than it is about life, about being yourself and forging your own path.Oh, sure, it is (in part) about romance, about love, with lines like this to prove it:“I must, then, repeat continually that we are forever sundered - and yet, while I breathe and think, I must love him.”“I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you — especially when you are near to me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame.”“My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?""And last but not least: “Reader: I married him.”But it is not “he married me,” or “we got married” but this free, independent spirit making a choice, even a socially unpopular one, because she sees they are equals. “’Jane, I never meant to wound you thus. . . Will you ever forgive me?’Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.”Some of the plot is mired in nineteenth-century melodrama: the cruel school where Jane is being starved, the sudden, dramatic objection to the marriage, the madwoman in the attic, the sudden shifts in fortune, the surprising splitting of the fortune, the fire, the blindness (I am working to avoid specific spoilers here!), though some of that also obviously serves to entertain, within the gothic romantic genre. There is a lot of angst, for good or ill.But that call in the night, “Jane, Jane, Jane,” that supernatural call between souls, I say that works. Class matters in this book. Money matters. How you are perceived in society depends in part on how much money you have, and so it is fortunate that Jane comes into money (somewhat melodramatically) because without it the decision she makes could make her seem less than equal in some eyes. Both Jane and Rochester are destitute at points, they suffer, but you know, finally, it’s not about the money, either. Yes, you can starve, as a penniless orphan, poverty kills, but being rich is not as important as friendship and love.One (not I!) might think this fails to be a great book because of some of the above details, but the thing that makes it finally great is Jane, Jane, Jane. And the effort she makes to live a rich (reading, teaching, art, nature, great talk, family) and independent and principled life. And that in the nineteenth century she makes such a stand against the Calvinist preacher! “Conventionality is not morality.” And Jane is so good without being sappy. She resisted, she persisted, she perseveres! Wonderful book."

94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45261627-sarah,Rating 5 out of 5,"Jane Eyre spans three genres and influenced them all: the loveless orphan finding a home at last, the school story, and the gothic romance with mythological undercurrents and an element of horror. We meet Jane as a scrawny and reviled nine-year-old living on the heartless charity of her Aunt Reed, enduring the abuse of her loutish cousin John and being punished for his transgressions. The penalty laid on little Jane on the day we meet her is particularly horrifying: she is shut in the so-called “Red Room” of the house where her uncle died, which is claimed to be haunted. Afraid for her life, the child pounds on the door, begging for release. Smoke poufs out from the fireplace; she takes it for a demon and faints.From this scene we are told all we need to know thereafter: the setting is England, the time uncertain (some place it as early as 1740, others as late as 1830), we are out in the country far from city or culture, the world is cold and dreary and hostile, there may be supernatural presences about, and this child is an orphan with not a soul on Earth who cares about her.Jane soon trades one unkind home for another when Aunt Reed sends her to Lowood School. There Jane learns all the academics and skills necessary to be a effective governess or schoolmarm.At Lowood, the sadistic headmaster singles bright, defiant Jane out as a soul to be broken. He humiliates her in front of her schoolmates, telling them to “withhold the hand of friendship” from her, and all obey him except a kind older girl from Scotland, Helen Burns, and the teacher Miss Maria Temple. Helen soon dies from a burst of cholera that sweeps through the school, killing half the student body, and Jane was further traumatized since she spent Helen’s last night lying beside her friend to comfort her, only to wake up next to a corpse whose eyes were still open. Miss Temple and Jane become close friends after this, but before Jane’s years of schooling are over, Miss Temple marries and moves away.Thus, Jane is utterly alone upon ending school and embarking the first and scariest adventure of her young life. She hears of an opening for a governess in a fine house way out on the moors.Thornfield Hall is an opulent but gloomy place. Jane’s charge, Adele, is a sweet if shallow little French girl, the ward (and possible but unlikely biological daughter) of the master of the house, Edward Fairfax Rochester, who is almost never home, preferring to brood his way through the Continent. Thus says Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper. Something is off about all the servants here, but Jane can’t put her finger on what. She also hears creepy laughter some nights, but is assured that that’s just the servant Grace Poole. Grace is certainly an alcoholic, but she doesn’t strike Jane as mad, and the laughter she hears is of something not quite human and possibly demonic…Jane’s faith is strong, but she can’t help but worry.One inauspicious evening, she’s walking through the forest and comes across a rather obnoxious gentleman. His horse throws him, and he jokingly accuses her of bewitching the beast, telling her she resembles a sprite or faerie. She bears his strange teasing patiently and helps him back on his horse.Upon returning alone to the house, she discovers to her great chagrin that the odd-looking, odder-acting man in the woods was Mr. Rochester himself. He was fascinated by the spooky creature he met out there, and upon learning that she was the new governess demands to see her. They converse before the hearth, him shocked to discover that she’s just as smart as he is, her bewildered that this eccentric and worldly man is paying her any attention.Thus many evenings pass. Jane discovers that Rochester isn’t really mean, just abrupt and mercurial, and she starts looking forward to her chats with him. One night Jane hears the crazed laughter again and follows the sound to Rochester’s room, which is in flames at the moment. She rouses the man and together they douse the fire out. At this moment she becomes aware of a tension between them. She’s never felt like this around anyone and can’t explain it. Jane gets summoned back to her Aunt Reed, who is dying after a stroke. Aunt Reed is cruel to the last, but confesses that Jane’s wealthy uncle John wanted to make the girl his heir, and the only reason he hasn’t is because Reed told him Jane died during the contagion at Lowood School. Jane, being an incredible human being, forgives her aunt for this.She returns to Thornfield to find Mr. Rochester busy entertaining his fellow aristocrats, especially a beautiful but unpleasant young heiress, Blanche Ingram. Jane realizes at this point that she herself is in love with Rochester, but knows he’s out of her league on every level and struggles to squelch her affections. She hides her feelings so effectively that Rochester honestly believes she doesn’t care about him at all, and he whines about her “coldness” so often that pretty much everyone knows which young woman he really harbors feelings for. Blanche is most displeased at the presence of this mousy servant girl.One of the guests, a Mr. Mason from Jamaica, is attacked by something one night and Jane sits with him while he bleeds and Rochester runs for the doctor. Rochester decides to mess with everyone’s mind one evening by disappearing and reappearing a while later disguised as an elderly gypsy woman. He fools all his rich friends, and even Jane is briefly taken in. While playing fortune-teller, he tells Blanche something she didn’t want to hear, and while he tries to trick Jane into praising him it doesn’t work.He’s entertaining, that Mr. Rochester.Despite this little hiccup, Rochester goes as far as to get engaged to Blanche, all the while kvetching about how badly he’ll miss Jane and how she’ll forget all about him. Pushed beyond her endurance one day, Jane blurts out that she loves him and it would kill her to leave him. Rochester then admits that he really loves her, not Blanche, and calls off the first engagement to start a new one. Jane is thrilled by this development, but her intuition still tells her something is wrong. Rochester’s mood swings and impulsive decisions worry her, and while he used to treat her like an equal he’s started talking to her like she’s a little girl. His insistence on her wearing fancy clothes and jewelry makes her very uncomfortable. The night before the wedding a woman—or a wraith—breaks into Jane’s room and rips her bridal veil in two. When morning breaks, Jane assumes she merely had a nightmare, but the tear in the veil is still there. Rochester insists that it was only a dream, and Jane’s dread increases.They’re about to say their vows when Mr. Mason shows up again with some friends, claiming that the marriage can’t go forward because Rochester’s already married.Now we find out the real source of the demoniac laughter: Mason’s sister, Bertha, a violent madwoman. Many years ago, Edward was tricked into marrying Bertha, who was already losing her mind. She proceeded to terrorize her husband, even physically hurting him, and humiliate him with her sexual exploits. As her condition deteriorated, Edward knew he had to institutionalize her for his own safety, but given the cruelty of asylums in those days, he couldn’t bear to leave her in such a place. Instead he confined her to the attic of Thornfield, with her serving-woman Grace to keep an eye on her. Grace sometimes overdrank to deal with the stress, and when she lay snoring and saturated in alcohol Bertha would sneak out to terrorize the house. Hence the bloody attempt on Mason’s life, hence the fire in Rochester’s room. Horrified and heartbroken, Jane knows she has to leave immediately, before the scandal spreads throughout the countryside. Rochester waylays her that evening, telling the whole story, and he earns back her sympathy. But he also begs her to run to France with him and be his mistress, his one-and-only, his wife in everything but official word and deed. Jane knows she’ll never respect herself if she gives in, so she packs her meager belongings and runs that night, onto the moors, and doesn’t stop running until she literally falls down from exhaustion. And then she gets up and keeps running.After several days of running she makes it to a village where a kindly young vicar and his two sisters take her in: St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers. They offer Jane a job as a teacher at their little schoolhouse, and she gladly accepts. Things continue smoothly here for several months.Eventually, St. John proposes marriage to Jane. He’s madly in love with another young lady, but he feels that Jane is better suited as a missionary’s wife, since St. John believes God is telling him to sail to India and preach there. Jane knows she can’t accept and refuses. Soon after she leaves the Rivers’ house, since things there have grown awkward. She has a quasi-spiritual experience wherein she hears Rochester crying out for her, as if he needs help, and she strikes back out for Thornfield. She finds the place a charred ruin. In the village nearby she hears that Bertha successfully set the whole house on fire. Edward made sure all the servants were safe, and tried to get Bertha out too, but she resisted him and leapt from the roof to her death. Edward survived, but lost his eyesight and his right hand. It is this Edward Rochester whom Jane now meets, a broken and humbled man who realizes that he drove her away by lying to her and demanding that she live on terms she found morally abhorrent. She forgives him, and he’s overjoyed to have her back.Reader, she marries him. As of the epilogue, ten years after the last chapter, they have at least one child, and Edward has dimly regained his sight.This book deserves its exalted status. The term “strong heroine” has become cliché and meaningless, so let me say that Jane is an exceptionally strong, brave, disciplined, noble character who happens to be female. Her moral fortitude is unequalled. Even Dorothea Brooke isn’t quite this resolute. And I’d like to see any of today’s hyped heroines *cough* Celaena from Throne of Glass *cough* endure what Jane endures. Brontë’s grasp of mythology and Scripture add immeasurable depth to the book. Some figures, such as Esther and Danaë, are directly referenced, others are implied. In many ways, this story fits the pattern of Hades and Persephone. Rochester is perhaps twenty years older than Jane, and lives in a gloomy place, a living grave for Bertha and a reminder of the deep past for everyone else. Also like Hades, Rochester was tricked into his present situation (ruling the Underworld, marrying Bertha) and then tricks his innocent young bride (giving Persephone the pomegranate, lying to Jane about not having a wife), not out of malice but out of selfish desperation not to lose her. Like Persephone, Jane is able to forgive him and eventually return to him, drawn back by some mystical, inexorable force. Curiously, this book which is both very old and blatantly Christian gives the Persephone figure much more say over her own fate than many of the versions that come later—for instance, Christine in The Phantom of the Opera is just as virtuous as Jane but struggles to stand up for herself. The “modern” heroines have it the worst: Sarah in Labyrinth is probably going to really regret eating that peach; Rey in Star Wars is so mentally and spiritually bound to the man she fled from that he will always be able to find her. Indeed, Jane is no bird, and no net ensnares her.Just read this book because it is just as wonderful as everyone says it is. The 2011 movie starring Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska is well worth your time."

Book Review

3+ out of 5 stars to Jane Eyre, a wonderful novel written in 1847 by Charlotte Brontë. I read this book on Spring break just prior to my 21st birthday, perhaps not the best time to take this beauty on. At 21, being a guy, and English major and forced to read a few books I didn't think I'd like, this came at a time where although I liked it, I wasn't as in love with as most others are... hence the 3+ rating. I believe if I read it today, it'd be a 4+. But I have 1200 books on my TBR and simply can't afford to take on any re-reads without losing my mind. Perhaps I should watch a TV or Film version to renew my interest? It has all the right parts... young woman suffering at the hands of the conventions of time and family (two things I enjoy in books)... the love of a 'good' man (meaning you see a relationship grow high and low)... and drama (will she escape it all?). Society was harsh nearly 200 years ago. I would not have survived. I am not vocal about my opinions of people's behavior or societal limitations, but I believe anyone should be able to do anything they want without hurting someone else or the world we live in. If you want to marry your cousin, go ahead... not my business. If you want to sleep with a new man or woman every night, more power to you. Doesn't affect me. If you want to wear revealing clothing... go look your best -- just don't do it where someone may cause an accident as a result! :) Point being.... I struggle sometimes with books that cover these conventions because I want everything to be free and open. And when it isn't, I can enjoy the battle to get there, but it's a bit difficult when I combine it with 200 year old setting and guides. That said... I adore Jane. I empathize with her. I could be her on some levels. The words and language are great. It should be read. But know what you're getting into!

96,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/150479757-akio,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm going to clarify this right away, now. I didn't like this novel when I consumed it back then. I had no idea how to properly appreciate classic literature, so I approached it as any other book. I had expectations from reading this novel, and I believe that was my biggest mistake. Because of this, I didn't enjoy the book or care enough to finish it; in fact, I skimmed the majority of it.The ideal approach to read this—and perhaps other classics as well—is to have no expectations. Just because it has been hailed as the pinnacle of literature does not imply that you should expect amusement, knowledge, or anything else from a classic novel. Allow the storyteller to linger in the moment with an abundance of words constructing to phrases and thus crafting to delightful paragraphs. Let the words flow through your mind and immerse in the moment. It requires a great deal of patience, and the reward may not be a particularly stimulating experience in the world, but it will almost certainly change your life. The story is memorable for a long time, if not forever.My perspective on classic novels has shifted since reading Jane Eyre. I'm prepared to read more of this kind of literature now, even though the plot isn't particularly thrilling.✱✱✱

“The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.”

I will not go into any greater detail about this story as I would like to.I think Jane Eyre is the greatest character I've ever read. Not because she is externally appealing to read about, but because her values of independence and staying true to herself are such a driving force, and they make her so multifaceted and human. She felt like she was narrating a true story about her own life.Every interaction and decision Jane creates with each character and plot point is crucial to the story. These are well blended with the strong descriptive prose of the character's storytelling, and the significance of Jane's choices appear to have been adequately hidden. It's not a distracting feat for me; I believe the passionate lingering of the paragraphs contributes significantly to the atmosphere. It describes such vivid emotions while also being plausible in light of the historical context.Although the tale was penned and first released over a century ago, the commentary behind the story remains pertinent and crucial today. Jane defies the expectations one would have of a woman, particularly during the Victorian period. She illustrates a woman who seeks independence.The gothic atmosphere of each setting, particularly Thornfield Hall, is truly admirable. The setting is chock-full of mystery and ambiguity, and readers will be eager for Jane to discover what secrets lie within the beautiful and dreary house.This is one of those stories that a mere review of mine cannot do justice to. I'll leave this evaluation feeling unsatisfied and wishing I could say more, but I can't. If I tried, nobody but myself would understand. I have a lot to say about each character, but if I try to express it, the end result is a summary of the book. A condensed version of their characters, with no arguments or conversations to offer.It's a shame I failed to write an extensive study of this story, but everything is fine. I will never forget this story. Charlotte Brontë achieved the feeling I had deliberately desired from reading a story, and the worst part was that I couldn't articulate what that sensation was.

Truly he is and I cannot for the life of me understand what Jane found in him to love.

Contemporary thrillers held a more behoved place in my heart. I began Jane Eyre with a dread in the pit of my stomach.Sure enough, my fears were not unfounded. I could barely abide reading one Chapter per day. But then at one nebulous point in the book, I began to appreciate the syntax, the style, the pacing, and the motivations of this classic. Having abhorred the first third of the book, I couldn't in my conscience give Jane Eyre 4-5 stars, nor laud her character. To be sure, I didn't love the titular girlish woman, but didn't also hate her guts. What is happening here to me? I think I'll confirm for my soon to be next classic read, whether a book where almost nothing of wisdom happens, has lit my guttering torch and has shown me the way to reading classics."
99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514998-rachel-l,Rating 4 out of 5," 4 stars! Jane Eyre is a book I've been meaning to read for years, literally almost a decade and never have. I remember when I was in middle school my mother showed me the black and white movie and I loved it, and then I saw the 2011 movie and loved the story then as well.My 2016 new year's resolution was to read a variety of genres and to read books I owned in paperback/hardcover that have been sitting on my shelves unread. Jane Eyre was next. In high school and college I read a lot of literature, but in the last 3 years became addicted to YA, NA and Contemporary romance, so the idea of reading a classic was a bit daunting and intimidating. I needn't have worried because after about 30 pages I was completely sucked into this book with its beautiful language and imagery. There's a reason this book is a famous classic that has withstood the test of time, because there isn't anything out there like it.Jane Eyre begins at Jane's childhood, recounting her harsh life being raised by distant family members who do not want her. She is sent to a boarding school that is harsh and unsettling. She survives and thrives with information, which leads her to obtaining a job as a governess at Mr. Rochester's estate, educating a young girl who is under his patronage. Here she finds happiness in her job and among the other inhabitants of the house. And soon she develops feelings for Mr. Rochester himself.I fell in love with the language of the book, it flowed across the page so beautifully. Jane as a heroine is unique, as she is plain and often overlooked, but she observes much and keeps a keen eye on her surroundings and occurrences. I was surprised to constantly read about how plain she was, and how her love interest Mr. Rochester is ugly. But it was refreshing to read about normal people and not beautiful blessed ones. Made the story more believable and authentic.Very angsty romance, and I thought I would love Rochester more than I did. In the book he seemed a tad bit more selfish considering the time period and what he was asking of Jane, whereas in the movies his actions came across as more romantic. Since I have seen the movies I knew what would happen, but the creep factor was still present in the books and I found myself shivering at all the strange happenings around Jane. If you are considering trying something new (or in the case of this book, old) I highly recommend this book if you are considering delving into the classics. I do not regret reading this book, and I am glad I finally cracked it open.

101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,Rating 4 out of 5,"It’s a steamy night here in the Knowsley Working Men’s Club, in Knowsley, Manchester. For tonight’s bout only, the organisers have waived their No Women policy but many slightly deranged working class men (it’s the lead in their bloodstream) are muttering darkly, and lightly too, and expectorating heavily against the walls (it’s the coal dust in their lungs). The promoter Manny Rayner clambers heavily into the ring.“Thang yew, thang yew, lads, this next fight is an elimination bout, three falls, one submission or death to decide the winner. In the BLUE corner, we have the mild mannered yet steely protofeminist from Thornton, Yorkshire, Miss Jane....EEEEEYYYYRRRREEEEE….”Scattered indifferent applause. Jane, clad in full length governess attire but with ridiculous bright red boxing gloves tied to each hand, storms to the side of the ring and shouts a torrent of abuse at the assembled grinders, mashers and collier lads. They tell her to fuck off. She tells them to fuck off. They don't fuck off and neither does she.“Thang yew, thang yew, and in the RED corner we have…. The Man from La Mancha himself, DON…. QUIXOTE ... ‘ere, where the fuck is he?”There’s no one at all in the red corner. Jane capers to the middle of the ring mouthing obscenities and shadow boxing madly. She grabs the microphone from Manny.“The man from la ManchaIs a bit of a wankerE –I-O, E-I-O”“Give us the fuck that back” says Manny, and seizes back the mike. Just then a galloping sound begins to emerge from outside the doors of the club. A couple of grinders open the doors, peer outside, then flatten themselves against the wall. Don Quixote is riding towards the club on his trusty horse LADY GAGA dressed in full armour, with a lance and all that medieval gubbins. He can’t stop. He comes belting in through the door and LADY GAGA, seeing a boxing ring right in the way, comes to a screeching halt. The Don goes flying. Up up up, then down down down, smack bang onto the centre of the boxing ring and through it with a great crash. Manny and a couple of collier lads peer down into hole. Manny takes up the mike again.“Thang yew gentlemen, tonight’s elimination celebrity death match has been won by a technical knockout, tonight’s champion is… put your hands together… Miss Jane Eyre…!”Cries of “Who the fuck cares”. Jane strides about bigging herself up and gobbing down into the hole where the dead Quixote lies in his mangled gore. She’s off her head now. “I told you but you weren’t listening - well, who’s the governess now? Eh? Eh? No, YOU fuck off! I AM THE GOVERNESSATOR! Yeah, me, not you, loser!”Later Jane writes in her journal.Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there is enjoyment in looking back to painful experiences past; but at this day I can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral degradation, blent with physical suffering, form too distressing a recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who repulsed me. I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not be helped: a boxing match, nay a celebrity death match. It was humiliating, true. It was not a noble occupation. The persons who saw me then for the first time, and who knew nothing about my character would have drawn lamentable conclusions. And as to the outcome, where it was not sinister and cruel it was piffling. Let me condense now. I am sick of the subject. I know not when I shall have to fight again. "
102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40792319-fabian-councillor,Rating 5 out of 5,"Jane Eyre is one of those books everyone says you have to read one day, often mentioned in one breath along with classics like Pride and Prejudice or Wuthering Heights, and I agree. This is an important novel about female independence, the development into an adult human being and the search for one's true destination in juxtaposition with traditional ideals and guidelines.But not only is it an important novel: Charlotte Brontë managed to include elements of humor, romance, gothic fiction and even a little mystery in her story, allowing it to address not only one specific target audience. Even if this book is not part of everyone's reading interests, it is a novel which will make you think about certain aspects (like the aforementioned themes), and maybe it will even make you feel close to Jane Eyre, the main character, and become interested in the story of her fateful life.Almost everyone will probably know what this book is about, but in case you don't, Charlotte Brontë introduces us to Jane Eyre who grows in an unhappy childhood with her aunt, later endures cruelty and her first introduction to the life outside of her own family at a charity school, and finally begins to live her own life when she starts to work as a governess for Mr. Edward Rochester. Even though the book may sound melodramatic in its outline, I personally think that it was the emphasis on the emotions each of the characters went through which allowed it to achieve its famous status. The novel is almost entirely character-driven for the majority of the story, making it easy to feel emotionally connected to Jane and her independent mind.I had some smaller issues with the book, including the coincidence of Jane, out of all the houses she could have went into in the entirety of the United Kingdom, entering the home of her only relatives she has left in the country. I did need more than seven months to finish the novel, but that was mainly my own fault because I wasn't in the right mood for it for a long time and did ultimately read most of the novel in the course of a few days, which should generally not provide a problem because of the sophisticated, yet very readable language.A true classic which can be recommended for all age groups and all kinds of readers, and which made me join the group of people who say everyone should read it one day."

O al menos, hasta ahora no lo era. Los poco que he leído no me han parecido tan maravillosos como a todo el mundo. No me habían causado una gran impresión, y ni de lejos consideraba a alguno como favorito.Pero este libro, Jane Eyre, se ha ganado un trocito en mi corazón para siempre. Por mucho que lo intente, no voy a ser capaz de expresar todo lo que me ha gustado este libro, pero voy a intentarlo.Esta es una novela dura, con un ritmo lento y desgarrador que detalla al máximo todos y cada uno de los sentimientos que cruzan la mente de Jane. Creo que nunca en mi vida he comprendido tanto a un personaje siendo tan diferente de él. He vivido el pesimismo de Jane, de su manera “frívola” de ver el mundo, de su desconfianza hacia todo y de su evidente falta de cariño. Me he sentido casi tan triste como ella misma cuando le ocurrían cosas malas, y he sonreído como un idiota cada vez que encontraba algo de felicidad. No tengo ni idea de cómo sería la personalidad de Charlotte Brontë, no tengo ni idea de si Jane es un reflejo de la escritora o de si es enteramente ficción. Pero sea lo que sea: bravo.Sin duda ninguna, Jane es un personaje al que admiro con toda mi alma. Me ha encantado ver cómo un personaje del siglo XIX se revelaba contra todo aquello que le habían enseñado, cómo se negaba a ser una mujer callada y obediente, y levantaba la voz por aquello en lo que creía. Por muy mansa que pueda ser en algunas partes del libro, siempre está presente ese espíritu luchador en sus pensamientos que tanto he admirado. Jane es simplemente maravillosa.Si me conocéis aunque sea un poquito, sabéis que no suelo disfrutar de las historias de amor. Y de hecho, esta tampoco la he disfrutado; la he vivido. Aunque a veces me ha sido imposible comprender al señor Rochester, he amado con locura su relación con Jane. No suelo entender el amor, no suelo aguantar las curislerías, pero la forma que tiene la autora de describir la admiración y la pasión que sienten el uno por el otro es simplemente increíble. Reitero una vez más: a pesar del amor que siente Jane por el señor Rochester, sigue fiel a sus principios. No se doblega ante su “amado”, como se supone que debía hacer cualquier mujer de la época. Y eso me ha encantado.Y sinceramente, no sé qué más puedo decir de este libro. Me ha parecido una obra maestra de principio a fin. He vivido este libro como he vivido pocos, he disfrutado con él desde el mismo momento en el que lo empecé. Estoy sin palabras.No soy ningún pájaro, ni estoy atrapada en ninguna red. Soy un ser humano libre con voluntad propia, que pongo en funcionamiento para dejarlo."

Worked for me anyways!I vaguely recall reading this in high school - specifically I remember being horrified that in the orphanage, the headmaster-type guy was so cruel that he didn't even want the girl with naturally curly hair to have curls because he felt that all the girls should be more modest and unconcerned about their looks or some such stupidity. I myself have naturally curly hair, so this seemed especially egregious to ~15 year old me.Now that I am a little more than double the age of when I first read it (that's depressing), other things stick out more to me this time around. Specifically , I *really* enjoyed that the male romantic interest is straight up described as being not very attractive in the looks department. THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN MODERN DAY ROMANCE BOOKS! So that novelty alone made me enjoy this book. But there are plenty of other, way more important, reasons why to love this and I won't bother going into them because chances are you have already read this book yourself at some point. If you haven't read it - go read it! It's a very relatable classic."

Y con buenos resultados, que es lo importante. Quería leer un libro de cada una de las hermanas Brönte. Me decidí por el considerado mejor de cada una de ellas en términos generales. Y vaya acierto.En el caso de Jane Eyre lo primero que me enamoró fue el personaje de Jane. De la Jane niña. Me encantaba esa cría con incontinencia verbal, que opinaba, sin cortarse, de todo y que no entendía y no veía bien la diferencia entre personas. Sin importar sexo o clase social. Es una estela que la Jane adulta mantiene durante toda la novela, aunque con ciertos bajones de sumisión, comprensibles en función de las cosas que van ocurriendo. Aún así, creo que el final nos vuelve a mostrar la verdadera naturaleza de Jane. Una mujer fuerte y coherente, que vive en función de sus reglas, no de las que le impone ningún hombre o la sociedad.Quizás es cierto que es la más ""cursi"" de las tres. Al menos en comparación con Cumbres Borrascosas y La inquilina de Wildfell Hall. Pero, en este caso, no lo sentí como algo malo. No me disgustó. Quizás estaba en el momento oportuno para disfrutarlo. Disfruté mucho la parte donde conoce a Diana y Mary y forman una trinidad perfecta. Imposible no recordar a la propia Charlotte con sus hermanas Emily y Anne. En definitiva, una novela maravillosa. Y, por supuesto, Charlotte se une a sus maravillosas hermanas Anne y Emily en ese pedestal tan alto donde las he puesto. Vaya talentazo de familia. Increíble. "

It’s refreshing to come across a female protagonist in classic literature that is so feminist (even though sexism still surrounds her - looking at you, St John... and at times... Mr Rochester), as women can often be portrayed as the weaker sex, forced to adhere to the gender roles and expectations of the time. But Jane ain’t having any of that.Perhaps there are some question marks over whether certain parts could be considered feminist, but for me, it all comes down to choice. And Jane CHOOSES her path. She is always true to herself and acts with such integrity and strength, and I could honestly write an entire review on why I love Jane so much... but I’m reviewing the BOOK, not Jane.The gothic atmosphere had me absolutely swooning - the writing is gorgeous, the setting is just right. And it’s pretty damn creepy at times!Another surprise for me was how absolutely hilarious some parts were. I was cackling away to myself when Jane throws water over Mr Rochester during a fire and he says “are we in a flood?” LOL and just the entire sequence with the fortune-teller was so ridiculous that it became endearingly funny.If I had to get nit-picky, I’d say that some parts maybe dragged on a bit, and I would be feeling quite eager for the story to move along... but that was quite rare. And I LOATHED St John. Usually I keep notes in my phone as I’m reading a book and jot down little thoughts, and lets just say... there were a lot of expletives and capital letters when I was expressing my feelings on St John!!It was a joy to become lost in this book, and the love story of Jane and Mr Rochester. I may have even shed a tear at the end. Jane Eyre has certainly became one of my favourite classics. 5 stars."
111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia,Rating 4 out of 5,"I first read Jane Eyre when I was far too young to really understand it - maybe around 8-9, when I picked it up from the school library, attracted to the enticingly-spelled 'Eyre', and then was grabbed instantly by the voice of Jane, also about 8 when the book opens, who refuses to conform to what a 'good girl' should be. Speaking back to the adults who lock her away, threaten to tie her down, and confine her till she is so psychologically stressed that she faints, it's only as an adult that it's possible to see the extent to which Jane's childhood experiences are unnervingly close to those of Bertha Mason: also locked away, sometimes tied up and whose 'madness' is such a cornerstone of her represented identity and function in the book. It's a complicated positioning that Jane and Bertha are both allied through their treatment and yet also opposed: Bertha has to be destroyed before Jane can return to Thornfield and make her iconic, if troubling statement, 'Reader, I married him'. To what extent might we see Bertha as Jane's 'shadow self', the wild, untamed, ferocious self that has to be confined and hidden away, domesticated out of the child and destroyed before Jane can take her socially and culturally sanctioned place as a 'good' wife? Bertha might burn down Thornfield with all its politicised representational burdens of patriarchy, social and class elitism, and racialised colonial wealth but Jane refounds a new 'big house' at Ferndean (thorns transformed to ferns?) however symbolically castrated her husband is. I was re-reading this as the foundational text to its revisionary 1966 rewriting in Wide Sargasso Sea - only the seeds of Rhys's freighted feminist and post-colonialist reception of Bronte's text are more prevalent in the original than I had expected."

In this Italian translation recently published, they translated the names.They translated.The fucking.Names.Meet GIANNA EYRE. Why? I mean, we have an endless number of translations of this masterpiece that have always maintained the name Jane (here in Italy no one is going to understand what the heck you're talking about if you say ""Gianna Eyre""), and then the publishing house Rusconi Libri comes up with this brilliant idea: let's change all the names.I need to clarify that I haven't read this translation in its entirety (but the bits I did read, I did not like at all): it was kindly brought to my attention by my lovely friend Chiara (you might remember her from my review of Mr Darcy's Diary) who bought this edition being none the wiser of the horror she was going to find inside. How could that be? Because they left Jane Eyre as a title and they also left Jane Eyre in the blurb. Then you open the book and TA DA. GIANNA EYRE.(The footnote in the following picture is from the translator and reads ""In the title, I kept the original Jane, in the text I always employed the Italian equivalent Gianna."")WHY. Besides, Gianna, while very Italian-sounding, is a rather old-fashioned name and doesn't sound exactly great today; I know no one (except for the singer) who's called like this and not many parents would choose it as a name to give to their child nowadays. It's lovely just like every name is, but my point is, it doesn't really roll off the tongue. Therefore, it makes the translation heavy and outmoded, as my friend Chiara proved by admitting she had to close the book and put it aside the moment she saw the translated name for the first time.Anyway, in a burst of masochism, Chiara and I tried to find out if the other names had been translated as well.AND THEY HAD.Grace Pool.Even Pilot, the dog.And pretty much everyone. (I've blacked out all possible spoilers.) EDOARDO ROCHESTER. PLEASE KILL ME NOW.What I want to say is... translation is a serious matter. You professional publishing house cannot just take any book that is now out of copyright, give it to an incompetent translator or re-publish a translation that is older than time, and hope to make some easy money out of it. It makes no sense, it's ridiculous, and it shows me the people who worked on this had no idea what they were doing. So, Italian folks: state alla larga dalle edizioni Rusconi!"

And the main trio of characters are so magnificent and psychologically interesting. Yes, I finally loved St. John (ok, the dude scares me!). And yes, I stan Rochester 4eva. And I know it’s fashionable to dump on the guy (did you people sleep through their conversations or what? I read this through my 2022 feminist goggles and I am ruthless at smelling a misogynist rat. Or a toxic relationship rat. There was none. He proved himself a kind empathic man with Adele and Jane. And we have no reason to disbelieve him about Bertha. He took care of her and did not lock her up in some dingy insane asylum somewhere in Germany and disappeared. So no, he is not Charles Dickens And yes, they deserved their “happily ever after” ).  Anyway, they make up an engaging trio, and act as foils to each other at different times. All three are passionate and ambitious and fiercely independent. One is all about his want, god be damned; the other is all about suppressing his want and religious zeal. One relationship is that of equals, the other one is a complete subjugation. And then there’s Jane, who’s in-between, who gets it just right: just the right amount of love of god, just the right amount of passion. Her arc is about finally getting home and resisting two big temptations. Rochester’s arc is the most dramatic. It’s about growing up, facing up to his crap and stop being a selfish bastard. And Jane coming into conflict with both of them, gives us the most fantastic memorable scenes in literature. Charlotte is a genius in writing dialogues. There’s incredible banter and wit; and poet Charlotte’s descriptions of the world are gorgeous. Fantastically edited, with impeccable pacing. Now I crave Villette...  - But did you know that Rochester is a bad boyfriend and there are convenient coincidences in the end?  *imagine the music ------------------How can I even begin to explain my love for Jane? She is my kindred spirit. Her boredom of stale life and want of adventures. Her pride not to take shit from Mrs Fairfax or anyone because she can always find a new job. Her understanding of circumstances and not wanting to be solely dependent on the whims of Rochester. Her self worth is rock solid. (Although she is admittedly not a good detective at all.) And I forgot what a drama queen Rochester was with all his hysterics and throwing himself on a sofa and sobbing. He reminded me of Natasha Rostova when her elopement plans with Kuragin were uncovered. He is such a fun emotional guy!"
115,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112077278-eliana,Rating 5 out of 5,"Jane Eyre is one of my favourite books of all time, ever. I took it on holiday a year ago and spent four days wrapped up in its intensity; it has remained scored on my heart ever since. There are no passages that bewitch me quite like the prose in its closely written pages—and there are no characters that have stayed with me in the same manner as Jane and Rochester. I've read and watched many, many love stories; but theirs is the one I will always come back to. But this book is titled Jane Eyre, not Edward Rochester, and for good reason. I loved the description of the inner and sublime thoughts of Jane, Jane the flawed yet nearest character to perfection in this book or any other I’ve read. I fell in love with both her kindred heart and her startlingly, unusually, poignantly strong sense of personal integrity. And I don’t want to give too much away, but Rochester, moody and sardonic with his bitter secret, walked so all the other dark, brooding love interests could run. It was this particular secret that permanently secured Jane Eyre as my favourite book of all time; I’ve never in my life been so utterly thrown by a plot twist. I actually had to put the book down for a minute or two just to recollect what I’d just read. I still can't bring myself to like Rochester. Even with Bertha outside the picture, I can't ignore his very obvious interludes of lying and manipulation. But I'll never cease to root for him and Jane; not when theirs is one of the most perfect love stories ever written. Too many authors play with being in love with the idea of being in love, but Charlotte whole-heartedly embraces the ideal of being madly, clumsily, shamelessly and agonisingly in love someone for who they are–not what they are. What I adore most is that this paragon of rapture is not achieved by two twins, but by two people who are deeply, fiercely and unapologetically different; and manage to share in so much good, nonetheless.Jane Eyre is also hugely quotable—the writing is, quite simply, gorgeous; the salacious dialogue between Jane and Rochester reigning supreme to anything else I've ever read. This doesn’t share the frolicsome humour or politeness of Austen; it’s at times a wildly dark story, but that’s what I love about it. It would be a thorough disservice to define this as a romance. Jane Eyre has turned girls into women for generations, and I know it'll only continue to do so.It's a sweeping bildungsroman, it's a feminist awakening, it's a passionate love story and it's everything in between. I love it with all my heart."

That I'm without soul?I have as much heart as you and as much soul.And if God had given me as much beauty and wealth,I would make it as hard for you to leave me as it is now for me to leave you.”
A few days ago, I had this irresistible urge to integrate something a bit different than my usual fantasy reads into my reading habits and range up my bookish palette a little (for personal purposes and not because I've had people tell me I'm not a real reader since I mainly read fantasy books - although that actually happened at some point but that's a story for another day), and it's only a coincidence that the hardback copy I own of this book is so pretty it was practically begging me to pick it up. I've got really little experience with classics. You could say I'm a rookie on the field, so imagine how I feel every time I jump into a book written decades ago expecting something, only to find myself pleasantly surprised at how actually relatable the content is. Jane Eyre is the refreshing (and a bit heart-wrenching) tale of a super woman without power whose ambitions and love for justice are bigger than all the obstacles life puts her through. I absolutely adored Jane's character, felt for her pain, cheered for her joys and related to her story more than I thought I would do. Heck, I knew this character is famous among feminists all around the world, but I just didn't realize how much of a badass heroine she is. I also particularly enjoyed the gothic elements and how they merged so well into a story so historically driven. In fact, Bronte's writing is whimsical and humorous. I think I lost count of how many quotes I found myself highlighting and I hope I'm not offending her die hard fans by saying I now consider her somewhat of a chick-lit pioneed. Don't come at me, okay, she's one heck of a romance writing master. Jokes aside, this was a really good book and I'm glad I finally gave it a chance it deserves. I'm definitely going to let Charlotte Bronte swewp me off my feet again in the future. {this book and other classics I'm gonna try getting around to reading this year, will be featured in a shelf called classic-lit-palooza and will be picked from a list of titles considered classics or cult novels that I compiled on a sleep deprived Wednesday night. It comprehends all those books I've always wanted to read and that I've challenged myself to finally pick up in 2021. I'll try to review these books in an objective way, and do my best not to let questionable/old-fashioned contents spoil my enjoyment, although I'll definitely take into account that many of these novel might contain or glorify those that are considered problematic themes or behaviors for today's standards. Not sure who I'm announcing this to. It's like #PenguinOnATBRMission all over again. I'm complicated just like this and my need to organize things sometimes goes out of control. Hence, the whole fanfare. Please, feel free to ignore. In case you're not tired of my quirks yet, you're more than welcome to join me on this adventure!}"
117,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144875643-vya,Rating 5 out of 5,"okay, wow. this, without a doubt, is a 5 star book. usually i tend to be a bit generous when i rate classics because i don’t expect to love them when i pick them up. but this book truly does deserve 5 stars. without being impossible to understand, the writing is masterful and the takeaways beyond insightful.many people characterize this book as a romance, but in my mind it’s more about a woman braving through life, forging her own path. it’s a daringly progressive, inspiring story of feminine fortitude. jane was and still is ahead of her time and a large inspiration to me.
“women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel. . . it is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.”“do you think, because i am poor, obscure, plain, and little, i am soulless and heartless? you think wrong!”“i do not think, sir, you have any right to command me, merely because you are older than i, or because you have seen more of the world than i have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.”“i am no bird; and no net ensnares me; i am a free human being with an independent will.” 
while I didn’t truly LOVE jane and mr. rochester together, i loved the love between them (if that makes sense). if it doesn’t, here are a few quotes that kind of sum up why a love like theirs—one in which two people fit so perfectly together—is so amazing:
“i am strangely glad to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home—my only home.“all my heart is yours, sir: it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence forever.”“you are my sympathy—my better self—my good angel.”“the world may laugh—may call me absurd, selfish—but it does not signify. my very soul demands you.”
above all, jane eyre is a story about morality, true beauty, self-respect, and life itself. i genuinely believe there is something for everyone to take away from this book and hold onto forever. i know for a fact that i will. and if I haven’t put down enough quotes, here are some of my last few favorite arbitrary yet overarching ones:
“it is a pity that doing one’s best does not always answer.”“i can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to do. i need not sell my soul to buy bliss. i have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price i cannot afford to give.”“most true it is that ‘beauty is in the eye of the gazer.’”“life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs.”
and one last quote, both an extremely popular one and my personal favorite: 
“if all the world hated you and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.” <3

119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward,Rating 5 out of 5,"Jane Eyre has saved me from a string of disappointments. I found it to be not only highly engaging but also surprisingly complex and thematically rich, despite its framing as a simple love story. On the surface one may criticise certain contrivances of plot, improbability of occurrences, and strangeness of characters (many are typical of the novels of this time), but one cannot fault the telling: Jane's voice, her passion and perceptiveness, and her deep morality, which is grounded not in religion or idealism, but in her own experiences and her own humanity. Her experience of hardship never devolves into pathos-evoking melodrama, and her response to adversity is refreshing. She is a confident and strong-willed person, but she is also humble, hard-working and is never selfish or vindictive. Though she does not lack in courage or strength, she always takes a stance of forgiveness and reconciliation toward her persecutors - a very Christian ideal.Jane's and Rochester's romantic, brooding love, is of a questionable nature. Built on an unclear and seemingly arbitrary basis, it is yet held, quite unreasonably, in the face of extreme adversity. Both Rochester and Jane are described as physically unattractive, and certain aspects of Rochester's manner make his character similarly unattractive to the reader (his actions and motives are at all times highly suspect). Something of the basis for the primary characters' mutual attraction is conveyed in their interactions. There is a way that each tempers the other, and their love seems built upon a sort of taming, of mutual dependence and reciprocal control. There is a sense that they are each at once both dominant and submissive toward each other. This is, I suppose, a form of equality - possibly even a revolutionary one in the Victorian Era - but it does not seem to me to be a healthy or stable condition. Yet there is a forcefulness and honesty in this depiction that speaks directly to a desperate human need for deep connection. This is an earnest passion, elemental in nature, quite unlike the detached, superficial affections of Pride & Prejudice.The later section of the novel featuring St. John Rivers invokes a sort of spiritual conflict, which, though awkwardly handled at times, creates a fascinating contrast to the passions of Rochester. Here is the real crux of the novel, as Jane is required to choose between the conflicting elements of her own nature. In choosing passion over servitude, self-determination over duty, she acknowledges and rejects the false morality of the religious path, in favour of her own convictions. While I'm not entirely won over by the character of Rochester or the nature of their relationship, I'm struck by Jane's courage and the implications of her decision. It is an argument in favour of equality and self-determination, and in support of intelligence and reason, while simultaneously acknowledging that passion is essential to human happiness. It affirms the Christian virtues of equality, fairness and acceptance, while rejecting its coldness and lack of humanity, and hints at the possibility of a humanistic, rather than divine basis for morality."

Que es un monumento narrativo, que es una explosión del romanticismo, que coloca a la mujer en el centro de la historia reclamando un lugar que le había estado negado, que está muy bien escrita, que es muy entretenida y llena de humor y drama, que es emocionante, que es un hito histórico y literario…Como creo que todo esto ha sido ya muy repetido, haré simplemente una lista de elementos que maneja la autora y que me han hecho disfrutar de esta obra a nivel de sensaciones y emociones.Sensaciones:-	El paisaje es tratado como un personaje más, se nos describe – o más bien pinta – como un cuadro, y acompaña en todo momento las emociones de los protagonistas.-	Junto con el paisaje la autora nos transmite vivamente las estaciones, nos hace experimentar el calor, el frío y el aire templado y delicioso de la primavera.-	Los paseos por los jardines o por el campo son un elemento fundamental en que se describen los dos elementos anteriores y su influencia en el espíritu.-	El contraste luz/oscuridad es continuo, tanto en el interior como a la intemperie – el fuego, las velas, el crepúsculo, la luna son elementos mágicos que enmarcan los encuentros y los paseos.-	Otro contraste es entre las escenas de soledad y la compañía – la música y el glamour de las fiestas, frente al silencio del dormitorio o de los pasillos desiertos.-	Me ha encantado la descripción de juegos y entretenimientos caseros de la época: las charadas, el arte y la magia de contar historias, la lectura como puerta abierta a otros lugares y otras realidades.-	También apela a nuestros sentidos la descripción detallada de la ropa: basta y de color marrón en el orfanato, ropa negra y sobria de la institutriz frente a los vestidos ligeros de colores claros y telas lujosas de los invitados a las fiestas.-	La descripción de la comida es importante: las gachas de avena quemadas del orfanato y el pan con queso que resulta un lujo en ese entorno desfavorecido frente a la caza y viandas delicadas que se sirven en las mansiones.-	Los muebles también son descritos con detalle y sirven para situarnos en los ambientes tan diversos en que transcurre la acción.-	Las descripciones de los viaje en coche de caballos nos hacen sentir las largas horas, la noche, el frío y la parada en la posada.-	Las condiciones de insalubridad y humedad también son descritas con crudeza y nos hacen entrar en la situación.Emociones:La historia de Jane está llena de momentos de abandono, humillación e injusticia. Pero hay otros muchos sentimientos que nos transmite:-	La mezquindad, la inflexibilidad y la frialdad de algunos personajes frente a la simpatía, bondad y altruismo de otros.-	La amistad, la familia y la fidelidad son referencias sólidas a través de todos los dramas que vive Jane. La inocencia y el cariño de la niña Adèle nos hace sonreír, así como sus parrafadas en francés.-	Los valores de la heroína son incontables: firme, auténtica, sincera, independiente, fiel a sus principios, estoica, sabia, generosa, con un gran corazón, llena de humor y fantasía…es mi favorita de todos los tiempos!- El misterio, la intriga, los secretos ocultos en la enorme mansión, los gritos en la noche que ponen los pelos de punta... gótico del bueno!-	Pero sobre todo el amor, el amor pasional, cuando retener la mano unos segundos de más provoca taquicardias, insomnio y una gran tormenta de sentimientos. Que eso es la novela, una tormenta que no cesa, y que entretiene un montón.-	Todo esto aliñado con un montón de perlas de sabiduría extraídas de la Biblia y otros clásicos que nos deleita y nos confirma que no, no se escribió esta obra por casualidad, sino que la autora tenía un bagaje lector y cultural importantísimo al que añadió una capacidad inmensa de deleitar y emocionar.Quería poner citas para ilustrar todo lo anterior pero me quedaría una reseña larguísima y tampoco es eso. Así que pondré sólo una que me parece que es toda una declaración de principios por parte de la autora y pone en valor lo que significó esta obra en su momento:Y supone una gran estrechez de miras por parte de algún ilustre congénere del sexo masculino opinar que la mujer debe limitarse a hacer repostería, tejer calcetines, tocar el piano y bordar bolsos. Condenarlas o reírse de ellas cuando pretenden aprender más cosas o dedicarse a tareas que se han declarado impropias de su sexo es fruto de la necedad."
121,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was my first time reading Jane Eyre! I couldn't remember ever seeing a movie...and I seriously didn't know what was coming next at any time in the story. I felt like a young girl might feel reading this book for the first time... ""enchanted""!At times...( only in the beginning)...I compared Jane to Mary Lennox from ""Secret Garden"". I have one pet peeve: the undertone of Christianity....starting very early in the book. Helen, Jane's friend at the boarding school was trying to show Jane a better way to deal with hurt, anger, and injustice. The wisdom that Helen was passing on was empowering and wise. It could bring more inner peace to Jane....ALL GOOD. Hell... being the type of person I was as a young girl...Helen's inner peaceful way of looking at ugly situations would have helped me too.Yet...what ruined it for me , was when Helen had to credit Jesus Christ. What's worse...is I liked Helen..she made sense. I just get annoyed that Christianity had to be labeled as it was. Jane's morals, integrity, and wisdom are also valid, even as a young girl ....( she didn't want to take shit if she were being treated with such dis-respect). Jane fought off Christianity throughout the book... as she aged. Thank God...I would have been disappointed had she not. I did get a little nervous that she might make a few wrong choices that would scar her for life, yet I had a hunch that she was clear enough about herself and choose love from a healthy center within herself. - not from one 'to please'. I actually think 'authentic relationships' was Jane's religion. I think she was emotionally connected to 'all' people who were worthy to be connected to that way...( whole and complete). Her character showed us that even in love - she could be an independentwoman - AND be emotionally connected to the man she loved in matters where it mattered most. Note: I have not read any reviews on this book - yet... I suppose it time I do! I was very late to the party with this book... but I'm glad I read it!!!The language - writing- was BEAUTIFUL!!!!"

124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76202320-henk,Rating 3 out of 5,"A true romance novel, as over the top in some senses as a Disney movie, with a generous helping of schooldrama at the start and a kind of love triangle between earthly and divine love at the endDo you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much soul as you — and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you.I liked this a lot more than Wuthering Heights but still found Jane Eyre not necessarily a compelling read, with all it at times sudden scene changes and lengthy dialogues full of closed questions and short snappy answers. Still Charlotte Brontë her main character is feisty, independent, stubborn, moral and quite modern and alive on the page, even after more than a century.The intensity of feeling as a child, the impact of events on a person, the rebellion against injusticeThe first ten chapters are about Jane growing up in an unjust environment (remember stepmothers being evil? Here I really felt angry against the family that took Jane in) and her going off to a boarding school of dubious quality. The halo and horn effect is definitely quite influential in how young Jane is treated like a devil, despite her nephew being much more weak willed and cruel. In general this book is a scathing indictment against class society and how chances are withheld based on position.It is interesting to see how Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights is an orphan basically treated in a same manner and turns out to be a monster, while Jane leaves this treatment behind her, guided by a person having trust in her (the angelic head teacher, it is quite like Matilda with Miss Honey). Lowood is like a girls only Hogwarts, with her earlier life being quite similar to Harry and his foster parents. And we have Helen Burns who is really to good for this world and an example to Jane to not give in to the world and stick to her faith.Overall the sense of never being enough to move up in the world in quite harrowing in a 14 year old.In respect to this section I have only minor criticism: the dialogues are not very smooth, a lot of closed questions from Jane, but I found this part of the book definitely the most strong and emotional.Move to Thornfield Hall and Mr RochesterThe heart of the book is focussed on young Jane moving in as a governess with Mr Rochester.I quite liked the banter between Mr Rochester and Jane, and how unwilling she is to recognize her feelings for him. It does often remind me that she is only 18, and this section feels rather romcom at times with the deliberate misunderstandings of each other.Jane turns out to be quite feisty and outspoken, despite keeping up the proper guise of a neat employee at all time. Saying in one’s face that the person is not handsome is something dear Jane, but apparently it only helps to entice Mr Rochester to take interest in her.The number of times in this section it is both said that he is rather ugly (even hideous according to Jane somewhat later) and the times she is called plain, are amusing when one sees that this as a love story. I also quite liked the side characters, Lady Ingram is something in terms of rudeness and believe in the class system and Eliza and Georgiana burning each other down is quite a sharp depiction of sisterly spite. At least there is no sappy ending to Mrs Reed, quite brave and going against what one might have expected.The love feelings of Jane are well depicted and you feel a kind of bubbling joy in chapters 23 and 24.Interesting how power dynamics play such a role in their relationship, its almost like Naoise Dolan her reflections on money in relationships in Exciting Times, kind of a love/fighting all the time.Jane is quite independent, even kind of making the proposal, making this truly a revolutionary story for it times. Chapter 27 is a rather cringeworthy chapter with a much too long recap from Mr Rochesters perspective and a Jane being stubborn and dead set on prolonging the book with 200 pages. Jane her demands of love are very high standard, any blemish and it’s the highway and I'll be a maid forever, bye.In this vein chapter 28 is pure teenage melodrama with self inflicted wounds, despite the empathy for beggars and their harsh conditions being well executedDisney level coincidences and St John the creepThe coincidences needed to lead to chapter 33 are on Disney film level in terms of sentimentality and moralistic messaging (choose poverty and family over money and romantic love and everything will in the end turn out fine).We have plain Jane meeting St John the absolutist sectarian who lives to spread the faith and needs a maid annex wife to help him in India. Despite him in some ways helping Jane at her lowest point I have no idea why she would genuinely be tempted towards such a proposal, if only to end up like a kind of martyr to the faith. Also them having another connection makes this whole overture rather uncomfortable. It’s a Twilight kind of triangle between earthly and divine love. Both Jane and St John are very stubborn and have a ""My way or the highway"" approach. And if one thinks about Rochester is as stubborn.Well in the end there is a very clean and traditional resolution, and all the lines are followed to their end with Jane uttering the magical words at the start of the last chapter, that otherwise is quite full of moralistic and religious messaging, Reader, I married himDutch quotesWelbeschouwd leefde hij slechts om te streven - naar het goed en grootse, zeker; maar toch zou hij nooit rust nemen, nog goedkeuren dat anderen om hem heen dat deden.Zijn waardering voor mij is als die van een soldaat voor een goed wapen, meer niet.Samen zijn betekent voor ons zo vrij zijn als in eenzaamheid en tegelijk zo vrolijk als in gezelschap."

I have had this book upon my shelves for over two years and had been putting it off since then. What a fool I was. This is a masterpiece of literature! I'm quite glad that Brontë included the childhood chapters, they really fleshed out Jane's character. Wasn't Edward Fairfax Rochester great? I cannot simply call him Mr. Rochester, he is EDWARD FAIRFAX ROCHESTER. What a name! I also enjoyed the company St. John, although his character is flawed, it was still a delight to find such a well fleshed out character so late in the novel, one felt as if he had been there since page one. I, for once, am not going to complain about the length. It is the perfect length. Its large size was the reason that I was so scared of starting it but I really could NOT put it down. I cannot think of what else to say of this novel except that it is *enter many superlatives here*. I loved it so much! I cannot say that it is my favourite novel but it is near the top."

“Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?”

Something that is commonly ignored in most feminist and romantic readings is that this novel has earned Bronte a status as a predecessor of James Joyce and Proust in consciousness studies. Some childhood experiences, as any cyber-psychologist will tell you, will shape our consciousness and temperaments for life. With Jane, the memory is that of Red-room. After the incident, Jane is constantly fleeing the three things that made it so scary – loneliness, submissiveness and closed places. Notice how frequently she is outdoor throughout the novel. She left her house, then Lowood and Thornfield fleeing one or other of the three but other characters in the novel seems to have suffered them too. There is also that sadness about her - although she is not meloncholy but she is not really cheerful either. She believed she was locked in Red-room because of her plain looks and with those looks, no one will ever love her.
Red-room and Bertha
""If there is such a thing as good marriage than it is because it resembles friendship rather than love.""  - Gabriel MarcuezI had this friend in school. Whenever someone told him that he or she had just got a girlfriend or boyfriend, he would ask the person if he or she was already sad. Upon being answered in negative, he would say in his wisest voice “give it time.” The thing is at the beginning (which is what we call the honeymoon period) the couple act all goody good to each other and use romantic dialogues.“She flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and accomplishments.” Except this stuff is like a mask subconsciously used in excitement to look better than we are and that worn away fast. What are left behind are two people who no longer know what to do. 

""I thought I loved her.”

There is a good chance that their temperaments won’t match -“I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger.”And where temperaments won’t match, the friendship that is at the root of successful marriages won’t develop. Then, there are always lies that get told in that first round in looking good and now there is a loss of trust.Same thing happened with Edward and Bertha Mason, and so they too develop a dislike for each other. Except they happened to be married and so were stuck with each other. Slowly dislike becomes hatred. I think so far Edward and Bertha felt the same and had similar experiences – what made Bertha’s position worse was that she was confined to her house. Her husband saw her as 'intemperate and unchaste’ – reason enough for her to stay confined to his house. This was bertha’s red-room - having nothing to do, no way to pursue her habits and no friends to talk to in those semi-dark rooms, she went mad.“Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer”...And Edward seems to have this habit of assuming that dominating role without realising he might be making people uncomfortable. There are enough examples to this effect - he didn’t pay Jane fully (when she went to meet her dying aunt) so as to make sure she would return, he won’t tell Jane that he is married with Bertha before they get married and later, on the day of a failed marriage, she found him listening at the door. That night Jane dreams of being locked in the red room – which acts as a motivation to run away in the middle of the night. That might be the first decision in all literature that was influenced by subconscious motivations.Edward’s red-roomEdward never was physically confined but his marital confinement meant a terrible loneliness with no visible escape. At one point, he is driven to suicidal thoughts – preferring hell to his present state. “ Of the fanatic’s burning eternity I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present one—let me break away, and go home to God!”  and decides to live his life on his own terms. However at the last moment, he changes his plans and turns to evil ways – “unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.” Perhaps this same sentence excuses the lies told by Bertha and her family as well. Just as they had lied, now Edward would lie too. But then to quote Jane 's very opposite thoughts,  “Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this” Maybe people aren’t so much as good or evil as morally weak or strong.Some of his extravagances can be explained, but then how did he never found any woman worthy? I think the answer lies in that same Honeymoon syndrome we discussed. It kept on happening again and again to him. Each time he thought he loved a woman, each time he discovered it wasn’t so – or maybe he himself sucked in those unmasking moments ""To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I find out they have neither souls nor hearts - when they open to me a perspective of flatness, triviality, and imbecility, coarseness, and ill-temper"" (yes, I’m unleashing a relationship theory.) This trial-and-error method won’t appear so wrong these days, so I guess the society, which is prejudiced against extramarital relationships and which taxes one party more than the other, gets part of the blame too. As FD puts it, “crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organization.”Then there is the unnaturalness of the thing “ Hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always by position, inferior and to live familiarly with inferiors is degrading.” It is easy to judge him for his wrongs but he did maintain Bertha and his daughter. I think his nature is like that of a stubborn kid who just happens to have too much power, that child-like assertiveness can innocently scare people in an inferior position. What is worse he doesn’t seem to know what he wants – and Bertha and other women were just unable to see through him. Only someone really assertive like Jane could have him bend his ways and make him see past that romantic jargon stage.When Jane learnt about her past, she didn’t judge him for that beyond a ’I don’t like you so well as I have done sometimes’ and forgave him for hiding it. And it wasn’t for Christian or moral reasons, that she chose to ran away but simply because she couldn’t live as his mistress which she saw an inferior position. She was very explicit about it (“there is neither room nor claim for me.”) I don’t know why people keep on confusing it.Jane’s choice“I would always rather be happy than dignified.”Why did people Jane chose Edward over Rivers? I mean what kind of attraction he could offer? The guy was ugly to begin with, more than twice her age and had lost his hand and eye-sight. (Sorry Vessey!) Moreover, Rivers seems to hold all the cards – he had saved Jane’s life (whereas it was Jane who saved Edward’s life), was good-looking, younger, chaste and having a worthy career.Pleasure over duty? Life with a blind man could hardly be a bed of roses. Jane probably didn’t work any less now than she would have in India but now she was in good company that made life easy.“There is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.”You can explain her choice with the word ‘love’ but, since I’m pretending to be the great relationship expert today, I will say, after some dramatic clearing my throat, love is like this umbrella word that is used for all kind of things and so doesn’t explain anything.Honestly for three days, I was like she should have rejected both the proposals. But I was, as usual, missing the point. While by being independent, she could avoid closed places and submissiveness, there was no curing her loneliness. Jane first met him when she was out in the woods all alone – feeling lonelier in a house where she had no one to hold lively conversations. She saw that Edward could fill that void. Later, on her first day as village school-teacher she felt alone again. Despite her efforts this time, she couldn’t bring Rivers to talk in a non-priest way. He was the only one who created for himself a prison – through his stupid sense of Christian duty; which probably became the reason for his early doom. The little happily-ever-after scene in the end (out in open, with an equal spouse and so very opposite of Red-house) is once again her describing their talks.“To be together is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company.  We talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking. “ConclusionLook Bronte wasn’t ticking off all the things a feminist novel should do as prescribed in some weird manual, neither was she writing a romantic novel nor was she writing a Christian novel; she wrote Jane Eyre in an effort to understand herself, her world and to strike peace with it. Jane lost a friend as a child; Bronte lost his sister - the lowest point in both their lives and hence earning ‘Lowood’ its name. Like Jane, Bronte too will become a governess and so on. Jane Eyre is a human, all too human, pursuing her happiness – at any price except one of those red-room fears. By the time, she met Edward, he was already a changed man - and his little disguises and jokes rather than being wicked tricks just show he had learned the lesson River missed, that life will have only as much happiness as you willing to force into it. He was just a natural choice for Jane, and if you still doubt it, remember how in the whole novel (I double-checked it) - with all her aunts, teachers, students, friends, servants, and cousins; it was in and only in his presence; and it was only and only because of him she ever laughed."

 ~ Rating- 2 stars ~(Content/ Trigger Warnings)-Mention of some of these in the review- Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë is a very beloved classic. It is considered a must read and a masterpiece. Unfortunately, I didn't like it.

“If all the world hated you and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.”

Jane Eyre was a book that I felt had a lot of potential, in fact, it was a book I was certain I would rate 4 stars after the first 10 chs. For me, the beginning of Jane Eyre and Jane's time at the orphanage was the most interesting part of the book. That part was intriguing and it gave a lot of depth on Jane's character, and that was the part I enjoyed most.The plot of this book mainly focuses on Jane's life and her time as a governess, and that was when I got bored. The pacing of the book was very slow after that and this was when I stopped caring about what was going on.

“I am not an angel,' I asserted; 'and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me - for you will not get it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all anticipate.”

The writing of the book was very good, and I see why this is considered a 'must read'. This is hands down one of the best books I have read in first person. 

“I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.”

I liked the character Jane. She is an actual strong person and I loved the way her character was written. She was one of the redeeming qualities of the book.

“I do not think, sir, you have any right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.”

I did not like Mr. Rochester. There were a lot of reasons why I did not like his character, most of which are spoilers. At first I though his character would be a typical brooding love interest, but I found his lack of personality unlikable.

“I have little left in myself -- I must have you. The world may laugh -- may call me absurd, selfish -- but it does not signify. My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame.”

I did not like the romance in this book. I found it slightly forced and didn't really see any chemistry between the characters. Spoiler thoughts:  I did not like that Jane and Mr. Rochester ended up together. Mr. Rochester lied to Jane, kept a truth from her about the fact that he already had a wife, and then proposed to her! This is basic information Jane deserved to know and I hate that it was kept from her.Mr. Rochester keeps his wife locked up in a attic where she eventually goes ‘crazy’, and this is just shrugged off? Jane does immediately get angry but later she forgives him. This just went against any attempt of making Jane a strong character as Jane forgives him for every mistake he makes.And I also didn't like that later on, after realizing that Jane is St. John Rivers cousin, he still proposes to her! I don't even want to go into that.Audiobook comments: I read the audiobook through Librivox, narrated by Elizabeth Klett. Would highly recommend the audiobook. In short, Jane Eyre is a well written classic. I would recommend it just to see the phenomenal writing, but I did not like anything else about it.

“There is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.”

130,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely,Rating 4 out of 5,"What I really liked about this book was the fact that Charlotte Bronte challenged herself to rise above the usual romantic formula. The story followed the typical romance flow: boy meets girl, they separate, meet again but it is almost like a deadend... but love prevails, they wed and live happily ever after. However, Bronte defied the convention by making the lovers plain-looking especially the male protagonist, Rochester. Bronte even extended this by having a Gracean-looking (Greek handsome) St John as Rochester's competition. Then, as if not contented, Bronte gave our eponymous heroine, Jane Eyre more reasons to stop loving Rochester in the final chapter of the book. However, love conquers all, including good reason and rational thinking so who am I to disagree with what her heart is telling her? The writing is superb. It can be wordy for a non-classic reader though. However, if you read slowly and examine the sentences, there are no wasted words. Bronte took time to describe the surroundings, the feelings of the characters and articulated well their thoughts. The gothic ingredient, that I understand was the fad during Bronte's time, was used to give an eerie feeling in some of the scenes but not as eerie as the way her younger sister Emily used it in Wuthering Heights. That was nice, since even if they were sisters, Charlotte and Emily, seemed to have very distinct styles.The plot, although intricately woven, is a bit cheesy and unbelievable, having a couple of too far-out coincidences. But I think Bronte intended to have this book read by women, this being a romance, so I shall not rant on this aspect. After all, I bought the book because I am into this crazy quest of reading all the books in Boxall's 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die and Bloombury's 501 Must Read Books and this book is in both lists. I postponed reading this for a couple of years now, but had to pick this up to finally read because this was voted as the April 2012 Book-of-the-Month by my book club, The Filipino Group (GR-TFG) here in Goodreads.The intricacy of the plot is due to the events that Bronte used to challenge her very interesting characters. Bronte seemed to know what could make her characters spill out their beans to the delight of her readers. There are no clear heroes and villains. Each character is portrayed to be just being him/herself given the time, place, expected behavior and the norms that England in the 19th century had. There are so many themes that can be deduced from the story: romance between equals, female independence, religion and social status. Compared to the women of Jane Austen's novels, Jane Eyre is a kick-ass. She is independent-minded, can work like a horse, and whose life is not centered on marrying any of the rich men around.For the superb writing, memorable characters and timeless themes, I have no doubt that this book will be read by many many more generations to come.

131,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11166121-em-lost-in-books,Rating 3 out of 5,"this is one of those books that i have read about in other books so many times. It is one of the most loved classics and apparently was gathering dust on my TBR for more than 3 years. I am playing Bingo with few of close GR friends and first category to be called was Classics. I was ecstatic, i brought out my copy of The Age of Innocence from my bookshelf. It's a small book and i got very lazy, told myself to just relax as my selection has only 300 pages. So one week went by (we have to finish a category in two weeks) and i finally came out of my slumber. I started reading Ms Wharton and within few sentences I realized I was in big trouble. I couldn't read Ms Wharton in a week as her writing needs time to get used to it. Hence, i started searching some other classics that fit in the category and I stumbled upon Ms Jane Eyre. i announced in my small group what I was reading and everyone told me how much they love Ms Eyre (and Mr. Edward Rochester). Surely, so many people can't be wrong. I am not going to go into details of the story and limit myself to why the 3 stars. First half of the book is really good. It remind me of Cinderella story (without the shoe of course). Cruel aunt and cousins, orphanage, and her time at the orphanage, I know it would be rags to riches kind of story. But things got twisted later on. She met Mr. Rochester, fell in love with him and was about to marry the man of her dreams but his past ruined it. And here lies my problem with this classic tale. She knew she was in love with him, and he also told her his past (and why he hide it from her). He was very sincere in revealing all his darkest secrets and in his declaration of love but she just left him in the dark of the night. why wasn't love enough for her? I am all in for her strength and how she carried herself after she left Thornfield. But I kept waiting for the moment in which she actually regret her decision but she never did. She didn't want to be with anyone else, she didn't want to marry someone else and all along known that Mr. Rochester was the ""one"" for her. I tried very hard to find her reasons for which she put herself and poor Mr. Rochester in misery (that wretched fool suffered a lot because of her)... and I am still not sure why did she do it. Hence the 3 stars instead of 4 or 5."

I feel like when I read this earlier this year, I was so stuck on getting through it that I didn't take the time to actually enjoy it. To experience it.This time, I made sure I did both.One of my favorite things about reading classic literature is finding all of the ways that human emotion doesn't change. It has gotten less explanatory since the nineteenth century, less poetic, but it remains the same nonetheless. Think of Jane's recollection of her love for Mr. Rochester and her immediate instinct to hide it and make sure no one else will know. Think of classing, and how you stick to a group because there's where you feel you belong. Think of work, and creativity, and your favorite hobbies. If you look close enough, none of that has changed, and none of it ever will.My favorite thing about Jane Eyre, though, is Jane's journey. I know it's the plot, but let me explain. I love how the only thing Jane has ever wanted is a family and someone to love her, body and soul. I love that all she ever wanted was to find a mind that matched and excited her own. I love that she never strove for wealth, yet always wanted to feel equal to those that were. I love that she always chose education over pity. I love that her entire life seemed to be at Thornfield Hall.I love that there's a mystery so carefully eluded to, but so incredibly important to who Jane is. She'll never let another human being define her, and she'll always choose indolence over anything else. She will always make sure that if she's going to rely on someone, she's going to make sure she can rely on herself first. She always sticks to her word and always follows what God asks of her, no matter how trying it may seem.Jane grew up an angry child who didn't know how to handle punishment or hardship, she grew into a woman capable of taking punishment where it wasn't deserved and choosing hardship over a life she didn't want... no matter how much it pained her to walk away.Does this book have its faults? Yes, but only if you look at it through the eye of someone not willing to live in the past for a while. Things change, and they always should. What will never change is how much I look up to, and strive to be, Jane Eyre. Ahead of her time... ahead of our time.- Paige"

136,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37069-benjamin,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was actually the book that made a reader out of me. I mean, I've always read books, But sometime in high school, I encountered Jane Eyre, and it just clicked. There was story here, and real people having real emotions. Now, I remember being deeply moved in grade school by  Bridge to Terebithia. But those were emotions drawn in broad, child-like brushstrokes. Jane Eyre was the first book that made me think about the process of reading--and just as importantly, writing--as a human activity. The novel was suddenly revealed as a social act: the creation of a community (of at least two, and perhaps many more). I think Jane Eyre was the first book I had to participate in. I had to work to understand the framework of the society, and to live with the characters to recognize their motivations and unravel what was going on beneath and around the written text. It was a revelation.I'm not saying this is the greatest book ever; it has its flaws of course. But it's still a great read, and a meaningful one for me. It's one of the books I return to every year or so, like looking through old wedding photos. And British writing from the Victorian era through WWII is still, to me, what literature is. Like the baby whooping cranes, I seem to have imprinted."
137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors,Rating 5 out of 5,"I first discovered this book when I was 15 and it was a great impact for me. I actually think that from that moment on I started looking through an adult and not a child's eyes. It awakened my passion for literature as well.Now, 15 years later I took it again and read it a second time, having watched countless films and series adaptations and having read many more novels, I have to say that I still find the book extraordinary. A masterpiece, in fact.This novel is maybe the first of its gender: part coming of age novel, part drama, part mystery, part romance. But not only that. Jane Eyre, for me, is the perfect heroine. The first woman of her time who dares to speak her mind, who is unafraid of conventions, who is liberated from social restraint because she has a free soul and a perfect sense of justice and goodness. She makes her own way in a masculine world and she overcomes hardship and suffering with an inner peace that is even a bit disturbing.The counterpoint is perfectly placed when she meets Mr. Rochester, a grumpy, moody and unpredictable man surrounded by mystery who becomes her only true friend, treating her like his equal in all senses. Age, beauty and social standards are reduced to dust when Jane Eyre finds a twin soul with some secrets to hide which will threaten her so much deserved happiness.One of the top in my book collection, this novel will always hold a special place in my heart. A true gem, don't hesitate to plunge into it."

144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt,Rating 5 out of 5,"For years I have always thought of Jane Eyre as my favorite classic lit, I only read it once more than ten years ago and have always wanted to do a reread but I kept postponing it because I remember the plot all too well and thought that there would be no surprises left. I should have more faith in my sieve-like memory really, there are in fact several important plot points and characterizations that have leaked away from my memory over the years. To begin with, I have completely forgotten that Charlotte Brontë wasted no time before putting poor Jane through the wringer practically from page one. “You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen’s children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama’s expense.”Says John Reed, worst kid ever. Jane, being something of a badass, gave mummy’s boy a little push and is summarily locked up in a creepy red room. Another thing that I have forgotten is that the novel Jane Eyre is something of a “bildungsroman”, a funny word that sounds like a bubblegum has gone out of control, but means a story that charts the protagonist's development from childhood to adulthood. I am surprised Brontë did not organize the novel into parts, not that it detracts from the novel in any way.I organized it in my mind like this:• At home with Mrs. Reeds and her lousy kids• Lowood Institution, worst boarding school ever• Jane the Governess• Post-Governess life• Spoiler TerritoryWhile Lowood is a spectacularly terrible school, Jane does find some warmth (not so much in the temperature sense) affection and kindred spirit there. I have forgotten this entire section of the book and I felt like I was reading it for the first time. For once I benefitted from my poor memory, this part of the book is wonderful. After eight years at Lowood (including a couple of years as a teacher), Jane finds a job as a governess to Adèle, a young French girl.Actually, Adèle is a pretty decent kid, she never said that.Her employer, and Adèle’s guardian, is one Edward Rochester, an incredibly grouchy man who is surprised to find himself attracted to plain Jane. They have a “meet cute” when he falls off his horse and Jane volunteers her assistance. How their relationship develops I will not elaborate but Mr. Rochester is one of the most vivid fictional characters ever, taciturn yet kindly, selfish yet generous, cowardly yet heroic. I also love his eccentricities, especially one scene where he does a sort of cosplay! Another remarkable man Jane meets in her life is clergyman St. John Rivers who is such a cold fish that they should have nicknamed him St. Sushi. He is also an overbearing buzzkill, party-pooper and general pain in the ass. A good man, no doubt, and a perhaps a good friend to have in times of trouble. The sort of friend I would quickly unfriend after ten minutes exposure.Jane vacillates between being a strong willed woman and a doormat sometimes, depending on who she is dealing with. Sometimes I do get a little frustrated with her, but you can not help but love her and cheer her on really. She is always true to herself and puts great value in her dignity and integrity, and that is why she is emphatically the heroine of this book. “Docile, diligent, disinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic.”. This is a fair summation.There are numerous other colorful characters in this book, this review would be twice its length to describe them all. The language, especially the dialogue, is indeed very flowery but completely accessible and really a pleasure to read. I was hooked by Jane Eyre practically from page one, this book has everything, drama, romance, character study, humour, moral lessons, and even a bit of gothic horror. If you have never read a classic novel from the Victorian era before you probably should start with this one. _____________________Spoilers section• What about mad, pyromaniac, Bertha Mason, then eh? Why is the security so lax that she is often allowed to roam the house and terrorize poor Jane, tearing up dresses, setting fires and carry on other madcap shenanigans. I will never know.

145,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,No Rating,"Jane Eyre is melodramatic, reveals social and ethnic prejudices against everybody apart from the Middling sort of English people who become curates or teachers, but has a vital power that transcends those qualities.In part this may come from its folk tale or fairy tale aspects, the plot is the love child of Bluebeard's castle and Beauty and the Beast, with references to fairies, demonic hounds, changelings and green men. More likely its power comes from the tension within two of the novel's central concerns: the woman in the attic and marriage.The idea that there is a primitive version of the self that just wants to be drunk, roar and fight that is shut up and locked away in an isolated place is a great one I think. But it is complex in that the first woman to be shut up in the attic is Jane herself and as this was an unjustified assertion of power it casts doubt on the case of the first Mrs Rochester who is apparently shut away because she is mixed race degenerate mad. A diagnosis of madness seems a bit of a moveable feast in any case (although, in passing, the regime that the first Mrs Rochester is kept under doesn't seem as harsh as that applied to George III as described in George III and the Mad-business). The example of Jane's childhood treatment forces on us the idea too that Mrs R. #1 was also a victim, maddened more by her unjust treatment than by the misworkings of her mind. Of course you can try to lock up your inner mixed race woman, attempt to contain her in your sub-conscious, but beware, in a moment of inattentiveness she'll be free and you subject to her impressive physicality.Mr Rochester's punishment by the author seems so severe, loosing a hand and his sight, that I wonder if there is an element, though of course that could just the reflect the strength of authorial feeling for his breeching the values of domesticity and the private sphere through repeated adultery, of punishment for being unjust towards the first Mrs Rochester?Marriage is the other source of conflict in the novel. Two men ask to marry Jane. The one offers a modest rational marriage in the service of God, the other offers the worldly temptation of sexual pleasure. While she embraces the latter with ardour, it's the former that is lauded for its union with Christ at the end of the book. While it is a sexual relationship that she wants, it is through the adoption of rationality and modesty that she escapes, strong feelings are either punished or locked up in the attic. The tension between rationality and the carnal ,I feel gives the book a lot of energy, as it gives us a narrator who is at once passionate and restrained, judgemental and modest, the Lord's elect (those who fall foul of her are punished) and worldly.The sexual politics of Jane Eyre suggest that there can only be either Domination or Dependence, and having failed at containing the woman in the attic (domination) the only over possibility for Mr R is dependence - being reduced into a state of child like dependence upon Mrs R #2. If anybody can be sexual and happy in Charlotte's view, I doubt, her message seems to be: Man beware, the similarity between the demure clothed form of woman and a volcano is non-accidental.  that St.John wants a celibate marriage plainly a mark of wise caution, releasing Jane from her corset would obviously result in him being burnt up like a piece of bacon On the topic of justice and rationality the treatment of the school is interesting. Unlike in Dickens, here the school is a woman's kingdom in which Minerva in the shape of Maria Temple  how's that for a name weighty with symbolism reigns. The child is trusted, evidence is sought, Justice blindfolded weighs evidence in the balance before pronouncing Jane innocent - this isn't a Dickensian world in which children are punished and abused by hostile adults and neglected by indifferent institutions. Is it significant that that Diana and Mary are reading Schiller's Die Räuber as Jane listens outside in the rain, seeing Karl von Moor rejected the order and convention of the world which had shown him injustice? German culture, unlike French is in Brontë's world positive (fairly typical of the time, for instance see Bleak House or Middlemarch  being too French is always bad though - as in Vanity Fair).Anyhow, for all it's extravagant prejudice and melodrama, it is a fun read with a lot going on under the surface. I'm sure that reading a Bronte biography would cast a lot of light on the dynamics of this novel."

Me ha sucedido a mí con esta novela, no quería acabarla, no quería despedirme de mi personaje favorito hasta la fecha, no quería decir adiós a esta historia que perdurará en mi memoria. Estamos ante un clásico inolvidable y que se convierte en mi favorito hasta la fecha.Jane Eyre no puede tener un mejor comienzo, durante la primera parte de la novela conoceremos la tormentosa e infortunada infancia de Jane. Es una niña de 10 años sumamente inteligente que tiene razonamientos certeros sobre su condición y que será continuamente castigada por ellos. Tras pasar diversas calumnias en su hogar será enviada a un colegio en el que vivirá situaciones que la harán madurar y cambiar en ciertos aspectos. Terminará convirtiéndose en una gran institutriz que un día trabajará en Thornfield Hall (lugar donde conocerá al famoso Sr. Rochester).Su personalidad es aplastante desde la niñez, no hay nadie que acalle lo que siente o piensa y su manera de expresarlo es fantástica. Poco a poco y tras pasar varios años en ese internado Jane sufrirá cambios que no harán sino mejorar su condición humana. He admirado a este personaje tan poco convencional para la época en la que fue escrito, Jane es una mujer resuelta que trabaja y que no quiere depender de nadie para conseguir su bienestar (económico y social). Es humilde, sociable, determinada, generosa, insumisa y tremendamente valiente y honrada.Es obvio que la trama gira en torno a Jane pero también hay otro personaje que la acompaña y que hará de esta en parte, una novela romántica. El Señor Rochester es un hombre austero, apasionado, impredecible y resulta muy interesante analizar su personalidad que es bastante compleja. Sus conversaciones eternas con Jane pasarán a la historia, son tan graciosas y divertidas que crean la delicia del lector. Se repetirán las frases sarcásticas cargadas de sinceridad y amor haciendo de esta una relación diferente y única.Charlotte Brontë escribe acompasada, tranquila y con una exquisitez asombrosa. No es una lectura difícil a pesar de la época en la que fue escrita, no se hace lenta ni pesada en ningún momento. Sus descripciones están cargadas de detalles precisos y bellamente estructuradas para que no resulten largas ni cargantes. Me ha fascinado la manera en la que la autora se dirige al Lector a lo largo de la obra, haciéndonos partícipe en todo momento de lo que me sucede a nuestra querida Jane. Está muy avanzada a sus tiempos y nos deja una maravilla de obra que representa un antes y un después en la vida de cualquier lector. Deseando seguir leyendo sus obras y las de sus hermanas."
147,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love classics, and of all the classics, “Jane Eyre” is probably my favorite. I must confess that when I read an interview with China Mieville, where he expresses how much he loves “Jane Eyre”, I think I feel in love with him a little.I believe Jane to be the most interesting female protagonist to come from that period in literature. She knows who she is, what she is worth and she refuses to compromise her principles, even when it has heart-breaking consequences. Her integrity and need for independence are so strong and highly unusual for the period. She might seem like a bit of wallflower, but there is so much character and strength in that little bit of woman! No wonder Mr. Rochester finds her more interesting that the shallow and silly debutantes who hover around him! (A word here about Mr. Rochester. He is creepy and grumpy and selfish. But I love his direct, caustic delivery and his cynicism. He is great character, who pays for his mistakes and ultimately redeems himself. I applaud him. Also, maybe I have a thing for sociopaths…)A Gothic novel in the purest tradition, it also has some amazing proto-feminist elements to it that I admit took me by surprise the first time I read the book. When Jane says, about women, that it is “(…) thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex” I think I actually cheered out loud from my corner of the couch. Every time she put someone in their place, whether it is Mr. Rochester or St. John (yet another creep… honestly, the guys in this book do not have their shit together), I couldn’t help but be so proud that she’d have the guts to not be the doormat these men clearly expect her to be, and stood up for herself. At the end, I was happy and utterly satisfied that Jane got where she was on her own terms.Some people think it’s preachy and that far-fetched coincidences ruin it. I guess these things annoy me too, but these were also hallmarks of Victorian literature, and I can’t bring myself to hold it against Miss Bronte because she wrote the way people did then. But I think the brilliant characterization, not-so-subtle critique of the over-privileged and their superficial idea of people’s values and the subversion of the usual heroes’ trope (neither Jane or Rochester is ever described as attractive; romantic heroes are usually drop dead gorgeous, if somewhat haughty looking, but not these two! They are gritty and realistic, both in their appearance and personalities) makes up for any deus-ex-machina moment."

“I am no bird; and no net ensnares me: I am a free human being with an independent will.”
So, the story goes: Jane Eyre is alone in the world. No parents, only an uncle who took her in but then died and left her alone with her aunt and some other siblings who despise her and think her an imbecile and impertinent and later on send her away to live at Lowood School, a state school, where the conditions of housing are horrible and even worsen so when typhus strikes and Jane loses her only friend there, Helen Burns.The book then fasts forward some years later and Jane, now a teacher, leaves Lowood School and becomes a governess at Thornfield Hall where she meets master of the house, Edward Rochester, who she finds quite striking, on the ugly side, but develops feelings for him, slowly and steadily. And then everything about him, to her, is beautiful.This novel really surprised me, you know. The first chapters, narrating Jane's story as a child, were so amazing and I felt like reading a bedtime story and it was quite wondrous for me. The entire love story subject is epic and I couldn't help but love both Jane and Edward. They were both strikingly deep characters and I couldn't get enough of them, especially when they were together and discussing. Chemistry was something palpable between them and I am not lying when I say that I knew these two would eventually fall in love, when they first met and set eyes upon one another.What made an impression upon me was the fact that Jane was such a strong personality, not at all stupid or easy to manipulate. From her early stages in life she was making her own choices and was not afraid to stand up for them and support them if need be. Another pros is that the story can get quite dark and bleak and that makes the book even more amazing so. There was something I never saw coming, something much like plot twist, which we rarely see in classic novels. I loved that twist and I get why Jane reacted the way she did but if that story taught me anything, is that if two people are destined to be together, then nothing and no one can stand between them. Finding and then losing someone and then finding your way back to them, seems to be a tale as old as time. "

Non ne ho letti tanti e li sto riscoprendo poco a poco, ma l'ho trovato eccessivamente prolisso e descrittivo. Alla quinta volta che veniva descritto lo stesso albero avrei voluto urlare.Jane Eyre è una protagonista molto lontana da me e, prima che urliate l'ovvio e cioè che il libro è figlio del suo tempo, posso dirvi che preferisco personaggi come Elizabeth Bennet. Ho trovato interessante la storia, ma temo che se non fosse stata per la magnifica interpretazione di Alba Rohrwacher (Audible) non sarei arrivata a finirla. Mr Rochester è un personaggio burbero, che dimostra affetto in una maniera tutta sua e a tratti mi ha divertito molto. Il loro lento innamoramento e i dialoghi hanno sicuramente reso più piacevole l'esperienza di lettura.La parte finale è stata tortura. Non c'è altro modo di descrivere come mi sono sentita nel leggere l'arrivo di St. John.Quindi l'ho odiato del tutto? No. Ho apprezzato il richiamo occasionale all'attenzione del lettore e la crescita e presa di consapevolezza di Jane Eyre e il rapporto con Bessie Lee e Mary Temple. Adèle Varens e Mrs. Fairfax, a modo loro, sono personaggi adorabili e il plot twist della signora Bertha mi ha intrattenuta.3 stelle, ma non pienissime."
152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta,Rating 4 out of 5,"Jane Eyre was orphaned and left in the care of her uncle and his wife as an infant. When her uncle died, life change dramatically for Jane as her aunt resented her existence and ultimately sent her away to boarding school when she was ten years old. This is her story, how she grew to want more from her life than the narrow confines available to her during the Victorian era and her rise from her circumstances. I started this story many years ago, was interrupted and couldn’t get back to it. My book club selected it for discussion and I took the opportunity to get it on audio. I’d heard so much about Mr. Rochester and Jane, all fragmented, I wasn’t certain if this was supposed to be an epic romance or something else. I’m choosing the “something else” as it’s difficult for me to think of their relationship in those terms but it definitely was an epic and complicated relationship. What I loved about Jane was her pragmatism and thirst for something more. Her coping skills were borne from her years of separation from family and anyone who cared about her well being. While I didn’t always agree with her decisions, I loved her reasoning. She wasn’t a complicated woman but she was a woman of substance, having her own sense of a moral code that guided her life and a strong sense of self. I didn’t always like Edward Rochester but by the end, I felt I understood him better and knew that he truly cared for Jane, more unselfishly than I first believed. It’s my understanding that Brontë infused elements of her own life into this story, probably some real and other parts aspirational. The result is a compelling story that kept me engaged and I enjoyed it.Regarding the audiobook...I’m glad I chose this format but I was unhappy with the narrator. She sounded much too old for the character and I was highly underwhelmed by her performance. I just chose the wrong edition. I highly recommend the one narrated by Thandie Newton, which is absolutely outstanding and I downloaded it for the last part of the book. I don’t recommend the one narrated by Wanda McCaddon. There are many other audio editions out there and you should sample them before final selection. There’s a reason this book is considered a classic and I’m thrilled I read it. So should you.Posted on Blue Mood Café"

""Τζέην Έυρ"" σκεφτόμουν εγώ τότε. Πώς είναι δυνατόν να διαβάσω εγώ, ένα αγόρι, βιβλίο που προφανώς προορίζεται για κορίτσια αφού ο τίτλος είναι ένα γυναικείο όνομα? Προτίμησα λοιπόν βιβλία όπως ο Όλιβερ Τουίστ και ο Τομ Σόγιερ και άφησα στην άκρη την Τζέην όπως και άλλα ""κοριτσίστικα"" βιβλία. Τελευταία διάβασα τα Ανεμοδαρμένα Ύψη της Emily Brontë και απόρησα με το πόσο μίσος μπορεί να χωρέσει σε ένα βιβλίο το οποίο θεωρούσα ρομαντικό. Διάβασα την Υπερηφάνεια και Προκατάληψη και γοητεύτηκα εντελώς από την ιστορία του. Η παιδική μου δεισιδαιμονία για ορισμένα βιβλία, ότι είναι ""κοριτσίστικα"" δηλαδή, ξεκίνησε σιγά σιγά να διαλύεται. Θυμήθηκα έτσι και την Τζέην Έυρ, την οποία είχα απορρίψει τόσες φορές στο παρελθόν……Έχοντας τελειώσει πλέον το βιβλίο, αν ταξίδευα πίσω στον χρόνο θα ρωτούσα τον μικρό Ευριπίδη... ""Ευριπίδη θα ήθελες να διαβάσεις ένα βιβλίο που θα σε βοηθήσει να παραμένεις δυνατός και θαρραλέος και να σε κάνει ικανό να ανταπεξέλθεις όποια κακουχία σου τύχει? Ένα βιβλίο που έχει μέσα μυστήριο, έντονες ανατροπές και συγκινήσεις, μάγισσες και ΙΣΩΣ ένα τρελό φάντασμα?"" Ή απάντηση μου θα ήταν σίγουρα ""ΝΑΙ"" τότε.Χαίρομαι όμως που είχα τελικά την δυνατότητα να το διαβάσω τώρα, σε αυτήν την ηλικία για πρώτη φορά και να το εκτιμήσω ακόμα περισσότερο. Πρόκειται λοιπόν για ένα βιβλίο όπου προσωπικά θεωρώ πλέον συνώνυμο της ποιότητας. Δεν περίμενα σε καμία περίπτωση να έχει τόσο βάθος. Να κρύβονται τόσα πολλά στις λακωνικές απαντήσεις των ηρώων του. Να πηγαίνει ενάντια στα πρέπει της τότε εποχής. Δεν περίμενα να ξαφνιαστώ τόσο έντονα ή να ανατριχιάσω. Και τέλος δεν περίμενα να συγκινηθώ με τον τρόπο και για τους λόγους όπου τελικά με συγκίνησε. Η Charlotte Brontë αρνείται να ακολουθήσει τα χνάρια άλλων συγγραφέων της εποχής. Η θεματολογία της πηγάζει από την φαντασία και αυτό αποτυπώνεται έντονα στο χαρτί με την γραφή της. Σε κάθε της πρόταση κρύβεται και κάτι άλλο. Κάτι πιο βαθύ και ουσιώδες. Παράλληλα και κάτι πιο (δεν μπορώ να βρω άλλη λέξη) παραμυθένιο. Επικρατεί μια σφιγμένη και ασφυκτική ατμόσφαιρα όπου δεν σε επιτρέπει να χαλαρώσεις. Υπάρχουν έντονα δραματικά στοιχεία τα οποία συνεχώς ""χτίζουν"" και ""φορτώνουν"" την σκηνή αλλά σπάνια ξεσπάνε. Υπήρχαν σημεία όπου ένιωθες ότι οι σελίδες του βιβλίου ήθελαν να ουρλιάξουν αλλά παρέμεναν εντελώς ήρεμες. Κάτι το οποίο δεν έκανα εγώ! Για την ίδια την Τζέην δεν έχω να πω κάτι. Είναι περιττό να προσπαθήσεις να χαρακτηρίσεις έναν τόσο ολοκληρωμένο και λογοτεχνικά τέλειο χαρακτήρα. Ελπίζω όλοι σας κάποτε να έχετε την τιμή να τη γνωρίσετε. Αμέτρητος σεβασμός και θαυμασμός πλέον για αυτήν τη συγγραφέα και για αυτό το τελικά όχι τόσο κοριτσίστικο βιβλίο. "

Good Christians who forgive, and pray for, their oppressors inevitably die young. Petty bitches who yearn for revenge, on the other hand, live long and fulfilling lives.2. The ideal meet-cute involves being mistaken for a witch and saving the man of your dreams from a life threatening accident (which he will immediately claim was caused by your magic powers).3. Under no circumstances should you ever trust a priest, no matter if he runs an orphanage or an evangelical mission in India. Priests are, by their very nature, egotistical and alienated from their feelings.4. Well-bred, morally upright English people never have any fun. Games, fancy clothes, and parties are reserved for decadent aristocrats or degenerate foreigners.5. Social media stalking your crush to figure out whether or not they’re into you is useless and a waste of time. Instead, you should focus your energy on more effective strategies, such as dressing up as a fortune teller and asking them about their feelings for you.6. A cottage in the woods is infinitely preferable to a luxurious mansion in the countryside. In fact, I would go as far as to say that Charlotte Brontë was the original cottagecore girl.7. Most importantly: you are never, ever, to trust any man you come into contact with. In the best case scenario, he’ll bully you, lie to you, or try to talk you into entering a loveless marriage with him. In the worst case scenario, he’ll steal all your properties and lock you up in an attic for the rest of your life.8. Bertha Mason deserved better."

159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43326703-blackjessamine,Rating 5 out of 5," Ci sono certi libri che per me hanno il sapore di casa. Quei libroni che mi riportano indietro ad una me appena adolescente, che leggeva solamente per evadere e immergersi in un altro mondo, che in un libro non cercava null'altro che una bella trama in cui fosse facile immergersi. Ecco, tutti quei libroni pieni di grandi case nobiliari in mezzo alla brughiera, pieni di dame dai riccioli acconciati e istiturici dignitose e timorate di Dio, quei libri ricchi di passioni e storie d'amore tormentate, misteri in soffitta e signorine per bene che sospirano davanti ad un ritratto per me hanno il sapore di tutte quelle ore passate sul divano della casa dei nonni, quando i compiti li finivo in un'ora e poi potevo mettermi comoda con una brioche alla nutella (sì, i nonni viziano) e il nuovo libro che avevo agguantato dalla loro libreria. Ecco, ""Jane Eyre"" è proprio uno di questi libri, uno di quelli che hanno il sapore di un caminetto acceso e di letture trascinate fino a notte fonda, e poco importa che in realtà io abbia letto buona parte del romanzo in un decisamente poco romantico e suggestivo treno o seduta a tavola nella pausa pranzo.""Jane Eyre"" è uno di quei libroni che in realtà scorrono via leggerissimi, una coccola per la mente affaticata da lavoro studio esami bollette scadenze burocrazia e tutto quello che mi sta sfiancando in questo periodo.Conoscevo già la storia della piccola istitutrice bruttina fuori ma così bellina dentro, eppure immergermi a Thornfield Hall è stato comunque estremamente gustoso. Ed estremamente stimolante è stato l'incontro con Jane, un personaggio così singolare, così pieno di contraddizioni eppure così compatto. Jane è intrisa d'un moralismo bigotto e assolutamente impossibile da scalfire e piegare, Jane è rigidissima nelle sue regole e nelle sue convinzioni, giudica tutti con una spietatezza quasi arrogante, fa calare le sue sentenze come lame, come se la sua pudicizia e la sua laboriosità la ponessero in cima ad un piedistallo dorato. Al tempo stesso, Jane è testarda, è passionale, la sua rigidità, la razionalità delle sue regole si scioglie come neve al sole davanti alla forza inevitabile della passione. E di nuovo torna ad irrigidirsi, perchè antepone un concetto di dignità personale che due secoli più tardi vorrei definire raccapricciante - e del resto, anche lo spirito più illuminato e rivoluzionario resta comunque figlio del suo tempo - a qualsiasi altra cosa, compresa la sua felicità e quella delle persone che ama. Eppure Jane è una donna non convenzionale, per tutto il romanzo non è mai, nemmeno una volta, soggetto passivo di decisioni altrui o di eventi estranei, ma è sempre agente attivo: è un personaggio che si autodetermina, è una donna piena di decisione e forza di volontà, una donna che nel 1847afferma che sbagliano gli uomini a credersi superiori a ritenere le donne più pacifiche e adatte solo a cucinar torte e rammendare calzini, una donna che nel 1847, da sola, trova un lavoro e si mantiene, una donna indipendente, che si rifiuta in maniera chiara e categorica di sposarsi, perché una donna, se non ama, può vivere sola. Ecco, ho letteralmente adorato che accanto a donnine che svengono al sentire il suono dei passi del proprio amato ci fosse anche una donna che, sì, ha una moralità intrisa di perbenismo e della religiosità più malsana, ma al tempo stesso si ribella, per quanto è concesso alla sua forma mentis, alle costrizioni sociali imposte al suo genere.Insomma, un bel ""romanzone in costume"" che mi ha saputo regalare tante ore serene, che mi ha riportato alle origini della mia passione per la letteratura, mi ha fatto palpitare e piangere calde lacrime sentimentali, e mi ha scaldato quell'angolino di cuore che sempre si indigna e infiamma quando si sfiora la discriminazione di genere."
160,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11916501-sandra,Rating 4 out of 5,"Lo sapevo da tempo. Da quando ero bambina e mia madre mi raccontava la storia di Jane Eyre, una giovanissima governante che si innamora del suo datore di lavoro, Edward Rochester, bello e tenebroso, che nasconde un terribile segreto nella sua casa nella campagna inglese ed io immaginavo una bella ragazza, dolce e generosa, che incontra il suo principe azzurro e sognavo l’amore eterno. Lo sapevo da quando ho visto per la prima volta il film Jane Eyre, e poi l’ho visto e rivisto cento volte, fino a conoscerlo a memoria, attratta verso la storia in cui ho capito che Jane tanto bella non era, era una ragazza come tante, e neanche tanto dolce, ma nemmeno Rochester era il principe azzurro che sognavo, era un uomo segnato dalle esperienze, un uomo di mezza età, corpulento, non molto alto, ma con due occhi neri che sprizzavano intelligenza, guizzanti come le fiamme di un focolare. Lo sapevo, dunque, che Jane Eyre è uno dei personaggi femminili della letteratura più affascinanti e moderni che siano mai stati scritti. Leggere il romanzo è stata una conferma. Jane Eyre è una donna moderna, che lavora e si mantiene da sola, è una donna decisa, sa quello che vuole, ha un carattere forte, ha sofferto ed è maturata, è intelligente e sa cavarsela nelle situazioni difficili, è concreta e pratica nell’affrontare quanto le capita; soprattutto Jane è una femmina che desidera un uomo, lo vuole con tutte le sue forze, il suo amore è carnale e concreto come lei, sebbene non sia solo quello ma anche unione di anime e di sentimenti. Jane non è una eroina classica, sdolcinata e sognatrice, ed è per me è il simbolo di come dovrebbe essere una Donna. Per questo ne consiglio la lettura in particolare alle giovani donne. Non è una passeggiata leggerlo, non per la difficoltà quanto per la eccessiva lunghezza, tanto che nella parte in cui Jane scappa da Rochester e trova rifugio presso la casa di St. John River e delle sorelle si sfiora la noia (ed è questo il motivo delle quattro stelle), ma il lettore è premiato dalle pagine appassionate della parte centrale e del finale, da brividi."
161,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"What was once something I tossed off instinctively, an out-of-five star rating, has become a source of considerable consternation. I feel as if I need to qualify each rating with the not-too-fine print warning of: ‘this does not reflect my judgment of the literary worth of this novel; rather, it’s a simple reflection of how strongly I responded to the work as a whole.’ But isn’t this just what everyone does? I guess so. So maybe it isn’t necessary, and it’s just come to feel that way because I’ve stopped writing reviews; I’ve stopped explaining myself. So from here on maybe I’ll cease providing star ratings (unlikely), or I’ll start writing reviews regularly again (more unlikely), or I’ll simply have to endure the faux/semi-faux/real outrage of my fellow Goodreaders (bring it, Harrison!). Incidentally, I think I’ve enough friends now that inciting somebody is inevitable by bestowing even four stars on a well-loved book. Three? Three is right out. And three is what we have here. Much of the charm of Jane Eyre is found in what, for me, kept this book from resonating significantly at this particular point in my life, one where I respond more strongly to the moral ambiguities and realities of the types presented in The Portrait of a Lady, Middlemarch, or The Kreutzer Sonata. Jane Eyre is a fairytale; it has a good deal of nobility on display in word and deed, and anything that doesn’t fall into this description is roundly labeled as vice and deplored appropriately. I’ve been made aware that, for its time, this novel takes some pretty bold risks in terms of social exploration. But for a reader who’s only mildly concerned with historical context this can feel like pretty cheap consolation, and I often yearned for Jane to expose a thought that fell outside of respectability, one that suggested she might be a human being. But Jane Eyre is a fairytale, one that perhaps commonly avoids this label due to a single deviation: no magic. (Actually, there is a rather literal deus ex machina near the end, but this is a conspicuous exception.) Besides this near total lack of physical violations, however, the book reads like a fleshed out fable with hints of everything from Cinderella to Beauty and the Beast. And this is, of course, intentional. It may also explain why this novel is often assigned or suggested to pre-adults. Brontë frequently makes allusions to folk and fairy stories, and her characters, particularly Rochester, often refer to each other as magical beings (e.g. elves, spirits) to key us in to the nature of the story as well as to help explain the mysterious, ethereal power one person can have over another. But while I can remain endlessly entertained by exploring the thoughts and emotions of real, human characters, I have a harder time these days remaining engaged in a more ethically simplistic world. To be honest, Jane Eyre came closest to being my first abandoned novel since I joined Goodreads. I rarely reached for it on the bedside table; it never seemed to make the travel cut when I was packing my suitcase. It was a form of escapism I didn’t feel like delving into. So perhaps, when conjoined with this background, my star rating makes more sense; it might even appear generous. The last 200 pages of the book do mostly redeem it. The plot starts to unfold with well-paced precision after having spent a good bit of time wandering between tedium and unconvincing melodrama, and I found myself genuinely wanting to continue, to see how this story would play out. So the book finished on a high note, and I feel no dishonesty in claiming, with a three-star click, that ‘I liked it.’ But upon some reflection and after receiving some welcome comments asking for further explanation, I realized that, apart from my issues with the characters, dialogue, and pacing early on, I had some fundamental problems with the story being told here. In particular, I have issues with the Jane-Rochester love affair and its resolution. Jane and Rochester can’t be together due to a technicality, but one that has tremendous potency in this early 19th century setting. Because it’s a technicality all the same, readers recognize it for what it is: a gross injustice. Rochester, in his fiery passion, wishes to transgress this infuriating obstacle and presents Jane with her first significant temptation—to be or not to be the mistress of the man she loves. Jane has already learned of his past dalliances, however, and she suspects that giving in to him will lead to short-term bliss and long-term misery. Only through marriage to Rochester, which is impossible, would she be able to achieve long-term happiness. If we take this at fairytale face value, it makes sense: marriage = happily ever after—50 years of marriage and no strife; mistressness = 1 month of happiness, a few months of strife, and eternal solitude thereafter. But Brontë seems aware that this fairytale situation is unbelievable. Rochester is, supposedly, an actual person whose feelings are not dictated entirely by a marriage slip. If he truly loves Jane but will lose interest at some point if they remain unmarried, then it follows that he will also lose interest if they’re married. He may not be able to leave her in that case, but this restriction would surely lead to even greater marital suffering and enmity. So the question is: how can we get to a situation that allows for a happy marriage given Rochester’s recurring profligacy? There’s a power differential here, of course, due to a number of factors: 1) inequality of sex; 2) inequality of social standing/money; 3) inequality of age. Mrs. Fairfax, the kind, old housekeeper, believes that these differences (that is, the second two) will lead to an unhappy marriage. And she’s uneasy about it before she learns of the technicality that inhibits the marriage. She recognizes that this is not a fairytale; this is marriage. So even when/if the technicality is removed, we still have this whole inequality thing to get around that’s brought up through Mrs. Fairfax. Again: how does Brontë fix all of this into a believable, acceptable marriage? How can she tame the wild, passionate, and superior Rochester and deliver him into a believably-permanent union? Aha! She mutilates him—physically. And the injury comes while he’s acting the hero, naturally. This is genius: it evens out Rochester’s intrinsic advantages, supplying him with a new neediness and permanent social scar, and it provides the bonus of boosting Jane’s already unbesmirchable character. Furthermore, while Rochester’s off nursing his newly reduced status, Jane’s busy inheriting money and making connections with her newfound cousins. The once unthinkable match has become exceptionally acceptable. Victory: status quo. Kelly and Moira have already addressed my criticisms in the comments below, and since there are multiple angles from which you can view this issue, you can certainly draw your own conclusions. Would I have felt more generous in my appraisal of the love affair if I’d responded more positively to this book on a gut level? Probably. But I can’t help feeling that even while she pushes the envelope in certain ways (e.g. critiquing extreme religious fervor), Brontë ultimately reinforces many inequalities that were, to be fair, endemic to her culture. Even so, I think I’d be more sympathetic to this point if the Jane-Rochester pairing didn’t feel like a regression from some of Jane Austen’s romantic set-ups. In the end, I think Jane Eyre was a case of the wrong book at the wrong time. The themes didn’t resonate like they could have, and I was overly-hesitant to let myself get swept up in Brontë’s mystical world, one that’s perhaps meant to resemble ours only superficially. I came looking for a 21st century relationship in 19th century England; I came looking for emotional depth and found simple forbearance; I came looking for ambiguity and found clarity; I came looking for real people and found saints and monsters.

162,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57236678-iryna-book-and-sword,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 stars “I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.”Can I say anything that hasn't been said already of Jane Eyre? I don't think so, but I will anyway. ​I think it's kind of funny how Charlotte Bronte wrote Jane to be the way she was just to prove to her two sisters that main characters don't have to be beautiful, or even pretty to be engaging. She certainly was as strong minded and progressive as a woman could ever been in early 1800. Did I have expectations going into Jane Eyre? I think I did. I didn't know that much about the plot, or the book itself, except that it was a book that I just needed to read. I honestly think that I loved it before I even read it. Reading classics for me is a whole experience, it's not just the book - it's the words, the tone, the atmosphere. It's never the ending result, but a journey. It's not like I can just go on Twitter and let Charlotte know how much I enjoyed her book, as I could with modern authors. She's long gone and all we have of her is her books, her words. So the only way we can communicate with her is by reading her novels, and to me that just sounds magical. “Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.”Did I like every thing and every choice made in the book? Of course not - because of this I had to take some time to reflect and think about the rating for the book. When I was reading it I definitely saw it as a total 5 star read, however, sometimes towards the end it slipped down to 4 stars, but when I was done I was back up to 4.5. However, as I slept on it - I decided that it was definitely and unabashedly a 5 star read and what was I even thinking? Too much information, I know, but that was my thought process. “Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour ... If at my convenience I might break them, what would be their worth?”I loved the flow of the novel and I loved that it was written as an autobiography, I actually didn't know that before I stared reading. Jane's childhood made me red with rage - her horrible cousins and Mrs. Reed was one of the most vile characters I've ever had the displeasure of knowing. When Jane left for school I was scared that things would be just as bleak for her, if not bleaker, but we did see some happiness and sunshine and I was glad. When she finally met the ever-famous RochesterI didn't know what to think, I just couldn't read him! He was angry, and passionate and randomly happy - definitely a bipolar sort of fella. But no matter what he did, or didn't do I just couldn't bring myself to dislike him! Sure, he was a pig at times, and the most insensible of creatures, but still my heart went out for him.“I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously revived, great and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.”I knew the big twist, I got spoiled of it by some other book (can you imagine that?? I was so pissed - the book was Clockwork Angel by Cassandra Clare, I read it a while back, and she just dumped that information unabashedly, like ""ohhh I'm spoiling the finest novel ever written no big deal"". Just because it's a classic, doesn't mean that everybody has read it!). Anyway. While I didn't much (at the moment) approve of Jane's decision I loved what it brought to the plot.I found it eye opening to see, how if you are all alone in the world - nobody wants to take you in. Novels often make lone travelers, or orphans so romantic and heroic, but in reality people are repulsed by them, and almost never want to help - and nobody freely invites a stranger into the house. I loved the honestly with which it was depicted here.Even though I never warmed up or forgave St. John, the ending made my heart happy (although if I may, I do think that it focused a bit too much on John - I didn't care to know of him at all.)​Jane Eyre is definitely one of my absolute favorites now. Now I have left to read a book by the third sister (Anne) so I can start loving this literally family fully and completely.My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG"

166,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3533262-stacey-prettybooks,Rating 5 out of 5,"I chose Jane Eyre to be my eighth classic of the year for two reasons: 1) I watched the adaptation last Christmas and, unexpectedly, really enjoyed it. Reading Rebecca earlier in the year also gave me confidence to finally pick it up. 2) I wanted to read The Eyre Affair by Jasper Fforde, but thought I may miss certain references, and so not appreciate it fully, if I haven't read the book.I hadn't really planned on picking up Jane Eyre when I began the challenge, but I'm so incredibly glad I did. I'm constantly surprised at how readable and accessible the classics I've been reading are; it has certainly changed my perception of them. I separated the novel into three parts: Jane's childhood, her time at Thornfield Hall, and 'after'. I really loved the first two parts of the novel: finding out who Jane is, how her unhappy childhood and neglect shaped her, key incidents in her life that she'll never forget, and then those people who showed rare kindness.Jane Eyre is a fantastic character - independent, honest, blunt and dignified. Even though the book was written over 160 years ago, and I'd expect women to be complacent and submissive (and for men to treat them that way), Jane is anything but. ('I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you.'). I was rooting for her all the way, yet devastating things kept happening to her, and I wondered if she'd ever get to be happy. Mr Rochester is also one of the most interesting characters I've come across in a novel. I'm not sure if I ever really liked him — he is complicated, moody and sometimes patronising and belittling — but I found him utterly fascinating. I enjoyed his witty, quick banter with Jane! The unconventional romance between them was also enjoyable, even though I knew what was coming. In one way, Jane Eyre is a simple, straightforward story but in other ways it's completely mad and dramatic. I think this contrast was why I was so absorbed and fixated with the story.The beautiful, magnificent writing was also one of my favourite things about Jane Eyre. It's just perfect; so eloquent yet not overdone ('Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education'). I admired the characters and their superior vocabulary, and the way that Jane addresses the reader. It's so different — more complex — from the writing style I usually come across, but so easy to read, something I'm constantly surprised to encounter.Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the 'after' as much as I had expected to. I'm not sure whether it was because I had been reading the book for longer than I usually would and it started to make me fidgety, or whether I just didn't find the situation as interesting, but it drew me back towards the end. It's the reason why I couldn't give the book the full five star 'I loved it' rating, although I desperately wanted to. I'm hoping that I'll appreciate it more when I re-read it someday, and it has still made it to my 'favourites'.Jane Eyre was a surprising novel to me in every way and I adored it. I have now added the latest adaptation to my Christmas list, as I'd love to watch it again, and look forward to reading Villette!I also reviewed this book over on Pretty Books."
167,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929592-jon,Rating 5 out of 5,"OK, I admit it. I'm an elderly male English major, and I never got around to Jane Eyre until this past week. I had seen several dramatizations, so I knew the plot, but I had no inclination to follow up and read a sentimental, depressing, girly melodrama. Then I recently read Saturday by Ian McEwan, in which a young girl, a budding poet, is ordered to read Jane Eyre by her poet/English professor grandfather. She dutifully starts it, hates it, rebels, and then is hooked and can't put it down. Inspired by her example, I decided that at last it was time. I hated it, rebelled, then got hooked and couldn't put it down. I learned that dramatizations always lose one of the key elements of a book--the narrative voice. This is the problem with dramatizations of Dickens, too. Jane is a truly amazing feat of representation--she is a complex and unforgettable character, presented entirely in first person by herself, not an easy thing for an author to pull off. She is at once the typical Victorian woman, selflessly anxious to ""be of use,"" preferably to a husband, but failing that, to children in a school; but she is also feisty, pitilessly accurate in her evaluations of other characters, and indomitable in the face of threatened opposition. Her love for Rochester grows slowly from slight hints to full expression. He frightens and dominates everyone except her. St. John Rivers is a kind, dutiful, devoted Christian whom she admires and acknowledges as her savior (his Christian charity literally saved her life); but she sees that he is also cold, implacable, and a bit of a bully; and if she agreed to marry him, his indifference would kill her. The reunion of Jane and Rochester at the end is every bit as good as it has to be. Anyone who could read it with dry eyes must have a bit of St. John's coldness. I've learned my lesson. Now on to Wuthering Heights!PS--I read the free Kindle edition from Amazon. Luckily I also had a papery version, because there were a number of misprints, some of them impossible to figure out. At one point Jane looked east in the evening and saw ""a casino and solitary star."" I spent twenty minutes trying to find out if ""casino"" had some meaning in 1847 that it has lost today; finally I consulted the papery version and found that what she saw was ""a rising and solitary star."" OCR has a lot to answer for."

There are many things that I love about Jane Eyre, but you can find most of them in other reviews, so I'll state a couple that propelled me toward a five-star rating.Here's a quote from Lady Gaga I adore: ""Some women choose to follow men, and some women choose to follow their dreams. If you're wondering which way to go, remember that your career will never wake up and tell you that it doesn't love you anymore."" In the novel Jane Eyre, Jane has to fight for her independence from the beginning. Later in the story she is forced to make difficult decisions regarding whether to sacrifice autonomy for the sake of marriage, or to remain self-governing and essentially give up love. I could relate to this conflict and its resolution, though on a smaller scale.The romance was amazing, of course. Despite the fact that Jane Eyre was published over 100 years ago, the dialogue between Jane and Mr. Rochester seemed incredibly modern. Their witty conversations had me laughing out loud, while their passionate inter-courses pushed me to the edge of my seat. Quite the intellectual romance indeed.If you're looking for something sophisticated or romantic, I would recommend Jane Eyre. It took me a while to get through but I don't regret a second I spent reading it.*cross-posted from my blog the quiet voice."
169,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25867535-carol-she-s-so-novel,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'll start off strongly recommending this Penguin edition.Firstly I loved the cover 

- even though I doubt that Jane ever wore pink. This edition was also very well annotated. I don't think I have ever made such good use of notes at the back of a work of fiction.&, last but not least, I read Michael Mason's very good introduction after I completed the book as I have had too many reads ruined for me by spoiler filled introductions (looking at you Martin Edwards) While not at the Edwardian (heh) level of spoilers, I still think I made the right choice. This was a very thoughtful introduction, that made the point;
Jane Eyre is a novel which it's readers tend to remember inaccurately at certain points. It may not be mis-remembered more than other novels, but it is mis-remembered more conspicuously than most...
I think this is very true. I have no memory of Jane's desperate flight from Thornfield Hall, & her cousins, the Rivers family My memory of this book is so much more... um chaste that I'm wondering if my previous readings (all over forty years ago) were abridged/censored editions. I was certainly unprepared for the passion in this book.



So I started the book fully prepared for the self-righteous Victorian cruelty to the orphaned Jane, I think I expected the rectitude but was unprepared for the passion. Rochester & Jane's declaration of love for each other are truly beautiful. Jane remains true to herself and her beliefs throughout except when St John (who I personally really disliked) was doing a form of Christian grooming on Jane. To be honest, I welcomed this (in a literary sense) as the book after Jane runs away from Rochester became a little dull.Other flaws were a bit earlier. Rochester  dressing as a fortune teller  - that was a little silly. & Charlotte, as a storyteller, just about ties herself in knots trying to explain Rochester's pursuit of Miss Ingram. Rochester never looks more unappealing then he does when he tries to explain that to Jane. & frankly, like Heathcliff, Rochester never looks that appealing to me. If any of the Bronte's every wrote a male lead that didn't look like an arrogant sod, please let me know.While I didn't totally love this book I admire it enormously -so ahead of its time! & in parts I was totally enthralled. The one thing I didn't stop doing was admiring Jane.

170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen,Rating 5 out of 5,"PLEASE EXCUSE SOME STRONG LANGUAGE IN THIS REVIEW. ROCHESTER PISSES ME OFF SOMETIMES.This is a wonderful book.Firstly, it is some of the most beautiful writing I have ever had the pleasure of reading.Secondly, Jane Eyre is such a strong and powerful character. Even though at times she has nothing, her will and spirit are indomitable, much to the frustration and dismay of those around her. She is so strong, so decisive, so fierce and moral that I really admire her and wish I could be more like her. She is amazing. I went into this book almost completely blind, and for that reason, I was stunned by how much anger and scorn I felt for Rochester. I couldn't stand him for most of the book. I hated how he referred to Adele, a young girl - as ""it.""I hated how he had made all these mistakes in the past and didn't learn anything from them. Having sex with random women who he didn't love and didn't love him, marrying a psychopath who he barely knew just to make his dad happy, scorning his little charge (Adele) because he was doubtful that he was her true father. Even if he's not her bio-dad he could make an effort with her. Yes, I know - he's amazing for even taking her in, things were different back then, blah blah blah... I DON'T CARE.Anyway, it's not his mistakes so much that pissed me off but his almost slavish devotion to refusing to learn anything from them. He doesn't accept responsibility for his actions. He refuses to deal with the reality of his life. He continues being a complete moron, even though by now life should have beaten some sense into him.Not only that, but then he fucks around with Jane. He knows that she's in love with him, and he takes great delight in letting her think for months (MONTHS!) that he's going to marry another woman. Apparently he finds this amusing. What an asshole.Then, when all is revealed and he tells Jane ""Surprise! YOU'RE going to be my bride!"" he immediately starts dressing her like a doll, buying her jewels, and generally disregarding all her wishes, thoughts, and protestations. All this, not surprisingly, culminates in Jane being in a panic about marrying a man whom she loves, but who is an arrogant, domineering, controlling asshole who sees her as a reward for all the hardship he's suffered.That's another thing! He constantly refers to her as ""fairy,"" ""elf,"" ""imp,"" ""witch,"" and other things which stress her otherworldliness and feed into his deluded fantasy that she's been sent as a reward for him after all the hardship (HA!) that he's suffered. It's fucking insulting. Jane is a person - not a reward, or a fairy gift, or a perfect 'cure' to his pathetic life. It's only at the end when Rochester has finally come to grips with his life: his sick wife is dead, he's learned Jane isn't someone he can control - that Jane returns to him. And she returns to him as an independent woman - one who now has friends, family and money. They can meet as equals, now, and live happily ever after.Except NOT, because Bronte has decided that in order for his schooling to be complete, he must be blind and also missing a hand. WHAT A LOAD OF BULLCRAP. I mean, I didn't like the guy - but I don't think he should be maimed in order to ""learn his place"" and crap like that. It would have been just fine if Bertha had died in the fire, he suffered without Jane by his side, he examined his life, he lost his house, etc. Jane is going to come back to him even stronger than the strong woman he already knew - wealthy, with family and loved ones. Why does Bronte have to reduce him to someone who is physically dependent on others in order to teach him a lesson? I hate when authors ""put someone in their place"" and do it by hurting them physically. It's cruel and unnecessary.This isn't because I think being blind and one-handed makes him ugly, or not a suitable husband, or unworthy of love etc. It's because I feel like he's being brought low - he's being shown his place and worth and it's with his cheek pressed against the floor and his tongue on Jane's boot (not that she wants it that way...but the author does). I don't like it one bit. I wanted him and Jane to be equals. I never wanted him knocked to the floor....Overall, an amazing book, a captivating read, and one that I'm definitely going to buy, read and re-read, lug around everywhere with me, and probably scribble in. I own it on my Kindle, but I need a physical copy to use and abuse. Thank you SO MUCH to Deborah Markus and Caroline for recommending this book to me and being such kind friends. :)P.S. If you really want to trip out, I suggest doing what I did, and read the whole thing while listening to The Glitch Mob's ""Can't Kill Us"" on repeat. This will only enhance Jane's utter badassery and your mounting excitement about what's going on in the book.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKxDzy...You might recognize this as the song played in the trailers for Sin City 2 - which I've never seen.

Hell, women have not even had the basic right to vote in the ""free"" world until a century ago: in Australia, 1902, and in Canada, England and the United States, 1917, 1918 and 1920, respectively. Charlotte Bronte was a visionary in writing this Bildungsroman showing the development of Jane Eyre from the time she was an orphan cast out by her aunt and into the oppressive Lowood Institution for an education to a job as a governess at Thornfield Hall as she transforms into a young woman of intelligence, passion, perseverance and a sturdy moral compass.As governess, Jane slowly falls in love with her mysterious, erudite master, Edward Rochester, who asks her to marry him, saying she has a ""soul made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break."" But could that snarling in the attic foreshadow a bad moon rising for the lovebirds? Despite its sometimes clunky prose, minor structural problems and a bit too much melodrama, I highly recommend this numinous novel which was obviously an impetus to Charles Dickens' David Copperfield published in serial form beginning two years later. Jane Eyre makes a thunderous emotional impact, sprinkling Victorian romanticism with elements of gothic, while giving the female character the gumption to go against the grain of what males tell her to do and the courage to follow her convictions.""Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs."""

Not because I love Jane (I do!) but because I lurve Charlotte Brontë. I love her blind spots, her hopes and her fears and her stubborn-as-a-pig morality that (despite Lowood and Helen Burns) isn't really apparent until the ""oh! all is utterly lost - love, life, hope! I must flee to the moors to find succor!"" bit. It's the same FUCK YOU, WORLD. I'M BETTER THAN THIS SHIT mentality that all the Brontë sisters wrote of, and I must assume really felt: Charlotte's Jane, Anne's mercy killings; Emily, just ... bein' Emily. They were willing to compromise and be act like Proper Little Ladies up to a point -- and then they fought back. And how. It's not a particularly Christian sense of morality, despite the vehemence of their claims to the contrary; it is instead a very simple, innate sense of worth and capability, and the right-ness of equality that will not be pushed aside.Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!—I have as much soul as you,—and full as much heart! ...

Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes.”Jane Eyre is not only considered a classic (if not the classic) in feminist literature, but an exemplary piece of Romantic Gothic literature. Personally, I view Jane Eyre as a Bildungsroman novel, one that wonderfully dramatises a woman's quest for self-realisation and personal freedom. Throughout the course of the narrative, the eponymous heroine of this novel undergoes an organic growth that allows her to find and develop her own individuality and to become, not only independent, but socially integrated.If I had to be perfectly honest however I will admit that I enjoyed Jane Eyre more the first time I read it. This second time round I felt vaguely disenchanted by its story and baffled by its romance (which I will discuss further ahead). This may be because in the years between these re-readings I read and fell in love with Charlotte Brontë’s Villette (which happens to be an extremely underrated novel). Jane Eyre feels a lot ‘safer’ by comparison. The storyline is fairly straightforward, whereas Villette has a rather labyrinthine plot, and Jane—unlike the dark horse Lucy Snowe—carries her heart on her sleeve. Nevertheless, there is much to be appreciated in Jane Eyre. Brontë’s writing is captivating and beautifully eloquent. Readers are likely to become fond of Jane and her many ‘plights’ within the very first pages. Jane is such a genuine character, and Brontë perfectly renders the workings of her mind. There are also an abundance of insightful passages regarding questions of gender, class, and freedom. Sometimes these subjects are actively spoken about or discussed between the novel’s characters. At times it is Jane who turns these issues over in her mind, questioning her motives, aspirations, and feelings. The friendship Jane develops with another girl early on in the narrative is quite touching. We can see the way in which this connection enables Jane to self-improve and to survive Lowood. Jane also finds a constant companion in nature. As a child she escapes her painful existence by reading Bewick’s History of British Birds. Whereas as an adult she finds it soothing to go outside for walks, often projecting her own states of mind onto the landscape surrounding her. Throughout the course of her story the image of the moon takes on an almost maternal role.“I watched her come—watched with the strangest anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on her disk. She broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward. It gazed and gazed on me. It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my heart—”Like Villette, Jane Eyre demonstrates Brontë’s awareness to the harsh realities faced by women who lack financial, social, or familial support. As an orphan Jane is incredibly vulnerable as she is entirely responsible for her own survival. As ‘humble’ governess she does not believe that she could ever enter the marital marketplace. Jane occupies an awkward space: she is not a servant or working-class woman, yet she is repeatedly made to feel as socially inferior to her cousins and socialites such as Blanche Ingram.“It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.” Jane herself merely wants to escape the oppression and starvation that she experienced at Gateshead and at Lowood. Yet, although Thornfield Hall is presented to us through a fairy-tale lens (early on Jane compares Mr. Rochester’s mansion to “Bluebeard’s castle”), it is by no means a safe haven. Still, Jane can see beyond its gloomy interiors, and in spite of whatever or whoever may roam inside its walls, she falls in love with Thornfield Hall. Its ground have a particularly soothing effect on her.Jane’s pilgrimage however does not end at Thornfield and the depravations that follow her employment to Mr. Rochester strengthen her resolve to gain true independence. What I love the most about Jane Eyre is steeped in solitariness. Jane is an outsider, a single woman without any concrete social aspirations (as an orphan Jane is wholly responsible for her own survival and independence), who as an adult is most at ease in the role of impassive observer. Yet, underneath her fixed demeanour lies a passionate soul. Throughout the course of the novel, as Jane grows from a “passionate child” into a solemn governess, she is negotiating contradictory forces: on the one hand she desperately craves independence so that she can positively and freely experience the world, on the other, she does not want to be ‘wicked’ or to stray away from a morally righteous path. She simultaneously fears and desires to be the type of woman that Victorian society would deem ‘unnatural’.Jane’s self-divide is strikingly rendered by her interior monologue which emphasises the interplay of psychological and social forces have on one’s ‘formation’. The dialogue between Jane's different selves occurs throughout the course of the narrative. Most of her decision are dictated by her simultaneous and conflicting desire for self-sacrifice and self-dependence.An aspect of Jane's personality that is present from her childhood to her adulthood is her integrity (which other characters—such as Mrs. Sarah Reed, St. John Eyre Rivers, and Mr. Rochester—mistake as pride). Jane's coming of age is the focus of Jane Eyre. Sadly the romance within this novel has often eclipsed its actual heroine. And while I can understand that modern readers may not see think of Jane as rebellious, to focus on her forgiveness of Mr. Rochester would be somewhat dismissive of her her earlier actions.Whereas in Villette  Lucy was fully aware of her romantic interest(s) flaws, Jane is much less critical. She does not seem to resent Mr. Rochester for having repeatedly lied to her and for having manipulated her. To Jane, Mr. Rochester is a victim. To me, Mr. Rochester is literally and figuratively big-headed. He gaslights, threatens, and emotionally manipulates Jane. He is awful. Brooding Byronic hero...as if. Most of what he said frustrated me. His redemption is extremely cheesy.Jane is also blind to St. John Eyre Rivers' horrible personality. He is yet another man who tries to coerce Jane into doing something she does not want to do. He also acts as if his own desires have godly origins and therefore must be obeyed.While I do understand that Jane no longer wished to be separated from the man she loves, part of me wishes that her story could have ended in a more unconventional way.“Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an automaton?—a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!—I have as much soul as you,—and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;—it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God’s feet, equal,—as we are!”Read more reviews on my blog / / / View all my reviews on Goodreads"

Un clásico que te llega al corazón y no se aleja de tu mente.
183,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/544124-russell,Rating 5 out of 5,"I commenced reading this novel with the idea that I had read this before fixed in my mind. It is in my nature to re-read books, so I thought nothing of opening the pages and immersing myself in the flow of the story.Imagine my surprise, Reader, when I quickly discerned that I had not, as I previously imagined, been acquainted with the characters that adorned the pages. I was at a lost on how my memory had failed me, but I quickly rallied and applied myself to the task at hand.My enjoyment of the book grew as the plot unfurled, the characters were pleasing to myself, their cares and concerns resonated with the inner workings of my own character.Ahem. Sorry. I’ll stop channeling Bronte.This was a story of passion, of grace, of human longing to love and to be loved in turn. It was Gothic, it was Romantic, it is a true classic. Sure, it played on not just one typical plot but two, the marriage plot and the inheritance plot, but they worked. Bronte teases one, and then the other, into fitting her characters’ story deftly leaving the core to to play out properly. The core story is of Jane finding someone to love and who loves her back for herself.Bronte’s other characters are written just well enough to have them not be just caricatures and a few shine on their own, but they all pale to the effort she puts into Jane and Edward Rochester. Rochester fits more along the lines of the Romantic Hero. Far more than Heathcliff. Of course, Heathcliff was the anti-Romantic Hero, so I guess anyone not him would be more Romantic Hero-like.Rochester is complex character. Bronte sets him up quickly and then lets him him loose in the story. He’s a powerful force, and it takes all of Jane’s willpower to stay independent of his will and drive. That she does it is a given, how she manages it is one of reasons I kept reading it.I think that the story is better suited for teenage girls than any other group. This doesn’t dampen the enjoyment at all for anyone else, but I think a teenager would really like this book. (If you could pull them away from the cellphone, or IM, long enough to get them started. Maybe bribery?)I also think that Jane Eyre is more universally appealing than Wuthering Heights, although both books are classics and are well deserving of the title. Wuthering Heights is for a more refined and discerning taste. (He says, adjusting his ascot and peering down from his jeweled pince-nez.)If you haven’t read this, or haven’t read it a long while, I recommend it."
184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4426615-jason,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is the second time I’ve read this book, the first being in high school. As it turns out, I remembered hardly anything about the story save for some burning bed curtains and an attic bound lunatic. What I enjoyed most, though, was Brontë’s exceptional skill at communicating human feeling by way of metaphor. Taking an example, Jane explains her tormented feelings of leaving Mr. Rochester as being struck with a barbed arrow:
Oh, that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment—how it goaded me! It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.

The entire novel is filled with this brilliant imagery. Brontë is a master of language and it is amazing how one can relate to these described emotions nearly two hundred years later. Although I do find it mildly ridiculous that Jane just happens to chance upon her long lost relatives in the woods, overall I really really enjoyed this book. Again."

I read Jane Eyre as a young girl and loved the story and loved Jane Eyre. I just reread Jane Eyre again and finished reading it in 1 day. My love for Jane Eyre has grown so much more with my maturity in life.This is a must read for all young and old. Charlotte Bronte your writing and the depth you took me was incredible. You had me on an emotional roller coaster while following Jane Eyre’s trials and tribulations. Thank you for that…

It was fantastic! The writing, the story, the characters, everything. Charlotte Bronte is a fantastic writer, way ahead of her time. I can't imagine how it would be to read this at the time it was written. I also think it's a good place to start reading classics if it intimidates you. I would definitely recommend it. "

189,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41763158-jess,Rating 5 out of 5," ""He made me love him without looking at me.""*UPDATE from nearly-twenty-year-old me: having just written an undergraduate essay exploring sexuality across The Wife of Bath and Jane Eyre (stay with me on this), can in fact confirm that Jane Eyre is an exquisite story of sexual frustration. Take that, brooding fifteen-year-old me! Bravissima, Brontë!*Okay, okay I know I shouldn’t still fancy Mr Rochester... but who am I kidding? I always have done, I most certainly do and I probably always will do. Anyway, it’s not like I hang out of my bedroom window on stormy nights, convinced that someone somewhere is calling to me. Ahem. No, most certainly not.This reread was perhaps even more incredible than the previous three for a few reasons:1) I am now eighteen. (The same age as Jane, for those of you who don’t know.) Whilst this makes the story all the more relevant to me at this particular point in my life, I can safely say that Jane probably outdoes me intellectually. (So Mr Rochester might not want me anyway… That’s a good thing, Jess. I’ll just keep telling myself that. *cries inside*) Jane is most definitely wise beyond her years and I’m fascinated as to why Charlotte chose to make her heroine so young, given that she didn’t meet Monsieur Heger, the real life inspiration for Rochester, until she was twenty-six. Never mind how much I like Rochester, I still can’t quite imagine falling for someone twenty years my senior. (Unless that be Sam Heughan from Outlander. That is entirely possible). Nevertheless, it was so great to view Jane Eyre as an eighteen year old and to compare the way I would react (or the way I’d like to think I’d react) to the decisions and actions Jane takes. Yep, inside and out, she's better than I am. 2) This time round, I could read Jane Eyre with a slightly different perspective. Yes, once again I’m talking about Anne Brontë. Once I’d read The Tenant of Wildfell Hall I promised myself that I was done with Byronic heroes and that I’d only show interest in sober young men full of common sense. I found the Jane/Rochester relationship a little bit disturbing this time, if I’m completely honest. Although I love them both, as I've grown older it seems to me a little dubious that Jane falls for the first man who intellectually stimulates her… but I completely trust her judgement. I’ve also found myself reevaluating my book husband. Like Jane admits, I’ve been wearing rose-tinted glasses for too long and I’ve overlooked his faults: he’s manipulative, threatening and tries to lure Jane into bigamy and fornication. And then, just look at Bertha. In essence, his treatment of women is highly questionable. I’m trying to move on from him, I promise - but true love lasts a lifetime, eh?And despite changing outlooks, my undying love Jane Eyre remains resilient. The writing is, quite simply, beautiful - and so amazingly quotable. Jane Eyre is worth the read just for the supreme dialogue between Jane and Rochester. John Mullan insists that Austen does the best dialogue. No. Just no. This is the best literary flirting ever. The interaction between Jane and Rochester is phenomenal - the way that Brontë writes about love (especially the unrequited kind) is so thrillingly accurate. She knows about passion. I think we'd better put it down to personal experience - Jane and Rochie are most likely Charlotte Brontë's fantasies about her (married) Belgian tutor Monsieur Heger. Poor Charlotte. She had it bad. Solution? Fanfiction!!“I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you – especially when you are near to me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame.”ITS CALLED SEXUAL TENSION! I can’t talk about Jane Eyre without talking some more about Jane Eyre. It's so nice to have a female protagonist who takes matters into her own hands for once. What a brilliant heroine: defiant, fiercely clever, determined and plain. Most crucially, she stays plain - she's not willing to change herself for anyone, instead she finds someone who appreciates her for the way she is. (No pulling a Grease here, guys.) I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently, and that is whether Jane and I would get on. I have a feeling that she’d think I’m shallow and probably a little immature… Well, I would always rather be happy than dignified. (Oh, and I’m unoriginal too!!) We’d fight over Rochester, I know that much.Gosh. What more can I say? I have too much sentimental attachment to this. I was always a quieter, bookish teenager and I’m pretty sure most of the girls around me thought I was bit weird for it (and for other reasons too, I expect!!) so it was lovely to find a story about a quiet, bookish misfit determining her own life… and finding someone who loved her for it.I’d quite happily pass on the 2011 adaptation (despite the sublimity of Mr Fassbender) because I can’t stand how meek Mia Wasikowska’s Jane is. The 2006 BBC miniseries with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson, however, is brilliant. But still. Nothing compares to the original and the best. It sounds melodramatic and cliche, but this novel changed my life. Jane Eyre has been transforming girls into young women for years and I have no doubt that it will always continue to do so."
190,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103664948-lisa,Rating 4 out of 5," I have just completed my third read of this classic novel. The first time I read this story I was 13 and fell instantly in love with Jane and Rochester and thought this was a love story. I re-read it with our oldest daughter when she was a teen and took delight in discussing it with her in the context of Victorian England and the the social and economic conditions of the period. And I just finished a third read for my Book Club. This time around I could appreciate the symbolism as well as the story and the themes.I am happy to say that this is a novel that holds up over time. I was pleased to once again grow with Jane from a sad and passionate little girl to a fully realized woman. I really love Jane's feistiness and independence:""I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being, with an independent will; which I now exert to leave you.”""Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, to absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.”as well as her integrity:“I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give.”""Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth?""Bronte's heroine is also a warm, compassionate, and loving human being; and I am happy to have spent time in her company once again."

نداشت که بدهد. چه سعادتی بالاتر از این که هم نوعانتان شما را دوست بدارند و احساس کنید حضورتان به آسودگی خاطر آن‌ها می‌افزاید. من به خودم فکر می‌کنم. درست است که تنهاتر و بی‌کس‌تر و بی‌پناه‌تر می‌شوم، اما شرافتم را حفظ می‌کنم. به اصولی وفادار می‌مانم که وقتی عقلم کار می‌کرد پذیرفته بودم، نه حالا که عقلم کار نمی‌کند. قوانین و اصول مال مواقعی نیستند که وسوسه‌ای در کار نیست. مال چنین لحظه‌هایی‌اند، مال همین مواقعی‌اند که جسم و روح آدم یکجا علیه این قوانین و اصول طغیان می‌کند.این قوانین و اصول سفت و سخت‌اند. نباید نقضشان کرد. اگر برای رضایت شخصی‌ام این قوانین و اصول را زیر پا بگذارم، پس دیگر چه ارزشی دارند؟ ارزش دارند و من هم همیشه معتقد بوده‌ام که ارزش دارند. اگر الان معتقد نباشم، پس عقلم کار نمی‌کند.. عقایدی که از قبل قبول داشته‌ام، تصمیم‌هایی که از پیش گرفته‌ام، تنها چیزهایی‌اند که در این لحظه می‌توانم به آن‌ها تکیه کنم.و نیز بدیهی است که سوءظن به آسانی از دل کسانی پاک نمی‌شود که خاک وجودشان با تعلیم و تربیت نرم نشده و به حاصل‌دهی نرسیده است. در چنین خاکی، سوءظن رشد می‌کند و مثل علف هرز لابه‌لای سنگ‌ها محکم می‌شود.ترجمه جناب رضا رضایی بسیار روان و دلنشین بود، امیدوارم شما نیز لذت ببرید."
196,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I couldn’t remember if I’d read Jane Eyre or simply seen film adaptations of it. I had not read it. I would not have forgotten this book. There are thousands of reviews of this well-known story so I shall not rehash but some points are worth mentioning.I am in awe of Bronte’s writing, not least because the thing must have been written and edited by hand, but also for her breadth of vision, her feminist instincts and her surprising modernity. Clearly much of this story is drawn from her own, difficult life. It was easy to admire her clever, forthright and independent young heroine, placed as she was in the cage of Victorian society – tough for women in the mid-19th century - by Bronte’s skilful pen.The leading men in this tale are insufferable bullies and at various points I wanted to reach into the pages with my hands and get them by the lapels. I didn’t quite understand Jane’s falling so heavily for Rochester. Nevertheless, Bronte clearly knew what it was to have a crush because she describes it so perfectly:“I did not think I should tremble in this way when I saw him – or lose my voice or the power of motion in his presence. [I know another way to the house, so] I need not make an absolute fool of myself….. [I was] scarcely cognizant of my movements, and solicitous to only appear calm; and, above all, to control the working muscles of my face – which I feel rebel insolently against my will and express what I had resolved to conceal.”Oh, I remember that feeling; compelling and ghastly in the same moment.Bronte’s account of Jane’s destitute homelessness is chilling and gripping. How many of us have had nightmares about finding ourselves in such appalling circumstances?I am not convinced we live in a classless society today but I think we are trying. Not so at the time of this novel when class distinctions were overt and unquestioned. Jane snootily appreciates the respect she gains from the village folk where she teaches the children of farm labourers “even though it is only from ordinary working people.” Oomph!I have great sympathy for those who had mental illness in Victorian Britain, especially those whose husbands called them monsters and treated them as such. I read Jane Eyre because Jean Rhys’ Wide Sargasso Sea was recommended to me, so now it is time to explore a tragic version of the first Mrs Rochester."

Savoring it like a fine bottle of scotch one little sip at a time, or like a reliable sermon on life's hazy questions with their crystal answers, or rather like an October sky preparing itself for a glorious sunset the likes of which you must have seen a thousand times but you are yet again swept off your feet against all perceived hype into the heights of a wonderful wonderful world?All of the above?, I know. I am one of those crazy creatures who has read this book for the first time in this day and age where the larger themes (feminism, individuality, individual freedom, Christianity) covered in this book have been exploited so brutally that it seems impossible to hear a new tune that piques your interest. Yet, here we are. Jane. A fresh melody, an eternal song.There is a love story in this tome with a hero in the name of Jane, and particularly to me there's a soul as well. It was given a temporary human form in the name of 
Helen Burns
, and then it lived on and evolved in the body of Jane Eyre. I am writing this review for Helen more than for Jane because seldom it happens that you see such a phenomenon.So this little orphaned kid, Jane, grew up and lived with an unforgiving, hateful aunt until she is sent off to an orthodox christian school that houses hapless girls for a decent education. It is in this school where she stumbles upon a lonely girl pensively reading her book on a bench where all other girls would rather play in the sun. Jane, interrupted her with questions one after another and she answered each with sincerity and patience which gripped Jane subconsciously. Thence bloomed a friendship that defined Jane as we come to know her.Her conversations with Helen were like putting balm over a wounded soul. At the time when Jane was forced into the reality of nothingness, when her mind and heart were most vulnerable, insecure, and restless, it was Helen who guided her with that light of kindness in her into a world of confidence and independence the kind of which only Jane got to see. For instance, when Jane feared to death about losing friends and reputation over a false rumor about her in her first year at the school, Helen spoke these words to put her back on her feet.
If all the world hated you and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved of you and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.
As they parted ways and Jane starting writing her own story, Helen had made such an impression on me as a reader that I could find traces of her in Jane's every thought or action. Helen didn't live long in the story but she lives long outside of it, in the form of a beautiful memory that strikes and encompasses you on a late Sunday evening at home. I will never forget how I felt when Jane walked up to Helen's room during curfew hours, embraced her with such fondness, and gradually dozed off unbeknownst to the fact that she was sharing her friend's last breaths.I do think that there were some flaws in the plot that Bronte chose to unfold, but that didn't thwart my pleasure of having to know Jane and the wonderful soul of Helen."
202,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134482683-jess,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel""First of all, Jane is EVERYTHING, Mr. Rochester, he is just... not enough.It has taken me a few days since I finished the book to process my thoughts, and I’m still at awe with Charlotte Brontë’s story. Contextualizing, it is the XIX Century and the social order is not even questioned, a woman’s role in society is to be a beautiful fool, and her goal in life is to be wed and breed children, preferably male. Bildungsroman is one of my favorite literary genres and up until now, I had not even realized that the protagonist in that sort of stories is always a man, at least the most famous ones are, so that is why I find this story even more relevant.Jane Eyre was as young as 10 years old when she came to the realization that she was alone in the world and that she would have to make it on her own, so her goal in life is the search for independence. There are many circumstances where she could have stayed in a place that was safe for her, or at least, the safer she could be, but she is restless, she needs more to life than the comfort of her confinement. ""It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquility: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot.""Throughout her life Jane is faced with situations where people fall under the same arquetypes; being an orphan she seeks family-like bonds wherever she goes (Bessie, Miss Temple, Diana and Mary) but she also finds entitled, frail men (John Reed, Mr. Brocklehurst, Mr. Rochester, St. John) and she learns to be poised, to study when her words are required, but she never doubts to stand up to injustices.“I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not? And one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature.”There are two characters that I feel could be used to draw a spectrum of how women are perceived by society. We have Helen Burns, who is portrayed as a passive, tolerant girl willing to endure the 'hardships of life', waiting to be redeemed by God, and Bertha Mason who is a straight up madwoman (no one likes a mad woman, what a shame she went mad). Jane breaks free from these gender roles, and she appears to us as a person, fighting oppression, striving for her dignity and honor.My favorite line in the book appears in the last chapter’s first words. Just four words: ""Reader, I married him"", That sentence alone is SO powerful, She decided that, the power disparity that had been there when she left the first time, disappeared, she stood there now, independent, powerful; she didn’t need him, she wanted him on her own terms, and that might seem ordinary but it is not.I have read many classics, but I feel this novel is the definition of 'timeless'. Jane Eyre, being a XIX century heroin is still a XXI century (feminist) role model."
203,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16392157-merna,Rating 5 out of 5,"Jane Eyre is a book that makes you place page-markers so that you may flip back and re-read a section because you resonate with it so much. ""If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people have it all their own way; they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but grow worse and worse. When we are struck without a reason, we should struck back again very hard; I am sure we should-so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again."" “I do not think, sir, you have any right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.” What I enjoy most about the novel is the heroine. She never allows her mind to be overruled by her heart. She's level-headed, but she also has within her a strong imagination that helps her escape the boring routine of life. These small idiosyncrasies make her so human and relatable.""Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it - and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended - a tale my imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.” I also love how well Bronte is able to bring her characters to life. You can sense the fiery and raw emotion of Rochester; the innocence and childishness of Adele; the vengeful nature of Mrs. Reed; the hypocrisy of Mr. Brocklehurst's character; and the arrogance and snottiness of Miss ingram. The themes that are at play in Jane Eyre, such as belonging, autonomy, love, social class and religion are beautifully interwoven. Autonomy is linked with social class; belonging is connected with love and religion. Jane Eyre, for me, is a masterpiece."
204,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40477684-maggie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Jane was a great heroine. The thing is, I don't see Jane Eyre as a love story, despite the fact how heavily it focuses on it at parts, becase Jane focuses on it at those times. I see this book as a story about a strong willed (yet soft in a lot of ways) woman who is, in many ways, ahead of her time. And I fully enjoyed the book becase of that. Much more because, for me, this book didn't focuse on the love story. It did have a lot of romance, but it wasn't the focuse of the story in my eyes. The focuse was Jane and her journey.Yes, I had my problems with Mr. Rochester (once or twice), but overall by the end he did redeem some of the things I didn't particularly like about his character, and maybe I even started liking him by the end.As I've already seen the adaptations before reading this book, I wasn't surprised by any of the twists, but it was highly captivating story and very enjoyable novel to get lost in nonetheless. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to read it every day, but if I did, I would read it in a few sittings, it was quite immersive an surpsisingly easy to read. I think it's the type of story I will enjoy just as much - highly probably even more so - upon second reread. 4.75"

All too often while reading Jane Eyre I wanted to bust out my backhand to the sides of these characters' heads...well maybe not Mr. Rochester. He'd take it as a challenge to a duel, and I've never so much as fired a flintlock. Also, my rapier-work is, well...what's a rapier?By no means am I saying this is a terrible piece of work. Charlotte Brontë sets scenes and moods (she's all too good at the moods!) like nobody's business. One need only read the set-up of Jane's school days and some of the details there of to see that atmosphere is a C. Brontë strong point.She does however have a tendency to grind a perfectly made point into the dust. I only need one example of a personality trait displayed. Add a mention of its repetition if you like to show its repetitiveness, but there's no need for multiple full-blown scenes that say the same thing.Part of my lack of overall enjoyment stems from my being a middle-aged man. I'm not the target audience for Jane Eyre. But if ever I'm turned into a teen girl, I'm moving this book back to the top of my to-read pile!PS: Give me Austen over Brontë any day."

I went into it not really knowing anything about the story and although it is long, and I did find myself wondering where it was all going to lead, the ending more than makes up for it.

⇝Preview
I swear to all that's good and holy (even though I am a pantheist at most, if not an atheist) that I was not one bit surprised I didn't enjoy this book. In school already I discovered that Classics are just not for me. Generally, I would say the writing style and the over all reality of how plots were depicted are what alienate me from the book as a whole and the idea of classics in general. they simply don't agree with me. And honestly, I don't give a rats ass.If it takes a certain talent or trait to recognize the beauty in classics I openly admit I don't have it. Reading is not about skill anyways, but about pleasure and I didn't get it from this book. I didn't like it at all. There were some things I appreciated or at least felt like I should like, but I didn't. I guess I only made it through this book because I took it on a holiday trip with me and didn't have any other choice but to read it.That being said, let's do a small review nonetheless...⇝Jane Eyre's traits and journey are revolutionary...for the book's time(maybe).Even though nobody would label Jane Eyre particularly feminist today, she certainly was an unusually outspoken and strong-headed woman. She was well-read, educated and insisted on maintaining her freedom always focused on maintaining her dignity.⇝Mr Rochester is not a dreamy man?(!!!)Just like with Mr Darcy.... I never quite understood what it was that made fans of Pride and Prejudice swoon over. I once read a fabulous article that illustrates perfectly that Mr Darcy is not a romantic hero but rather a manipulative twat. For those of you, who do not want to read the entire article can enjoy this quote from it:""Negging is the act of emotional manipulation whereby a person makes a deliberate backhanded compliment, or flirtatious remark, to undermine someone’s confidence and increase the need for approval.""Undermining someone's confidence has never been and is not simply a dating strategy, in fact, it proves that the person in question ""is a manipulative, hypocritical, self-centred depressive, aware of some of his faults but unapologetic for them because he is bound by arrogance to ignore them.”[...]“When you Google Mr Darcy there are so many female apologists for his behaviour.” So many say he is just shy. “Women are so, so keen to preserve the romantic mysticism of Mr Darcy.”Mr. Rochester pretty much falls into the exact same category. First of all, his courting methods are just weird. 1) He shows affection mostly when they are alone. Okay, yeah, her being about a thousand social levels below him might have something to do with it but still. And he disguised himself to find out whether she would actually voice her attraction towards him to a ""stranger"". Uhm? Bad at communication, much? Turns out in fact, he is, because...2) He hid the fact that he was married already from her and she only found out the day of the wedding. Apparently, he was somewhat tricked into marrying into a family where the women turned mad at some point in their life. This also happened to his actual wife. Do you know what his decision was? To lock her up and hide her in his gigantic house. Given the fact that he is an outrageously wealthy man, I find it unbelievably he didn't try to get her the best care possible with skilled doctors, maybe even at a proper institution. I have to admit, though, that I am not aware of what the possibilities actually were back then - did care institutions in whatever form even exist back then? Anyways, it is inexcusable, I judge him for it. Because I honestly value my time too much to spend more than the 60 minutes I already invested in this on further explaining why this book didn't agree with me, I will now say buy and move on to more pleasant books, i. e. Aurora Rising (which, btw. did not turn out to be nearly as pleasant as I expected it to be)______________

Plus Tadiana ( hopefully Kristin ), Rabbit & Andrea.Coming to a Goodreads near you May 15, 2015. This is not my full review, this is just the story (in a play like form) of why I DNF'd this when I was 16. I decided on a condensed version of the truth, in case you are wondering, Kristin & Heather. *Curtain Rise*Scene 1:Stage setting: no lighting. Cue music: ‘Something I can never have’ by Nine Inch Nails begins to play softly. Fighting is heard from the top of the theatre centre aisle. The tumbling bodies of D and C make their way down the aisle. Cue spotlight stage left. K sits in a faded laze-e-boy chair reading a book, Jane Eyre, not noticing the scuffling approaching the stage from the centre aisle. Full lights on stage, entire cast is on set. Some are drunkenly talking, others excitedly engaged with one and other. All are loud. There are bottles littered about the yard. A faux fire burns in centre stage. D and C arrive on stage. Music stops.K continues to read, not looking up at any of the noise or commotion. D sneaks up behind her chair and snatches the book out of her hand, ripping it in two and tossing the pieces in the air with a drunken, menacing look. K stares at D silently. A single tear rolls down her face as she gathers together the pieces of her book scattered around stage left. Silently she exits the stage to the left of the curtains. D follows her off stage. A muffled scream pierces the air. *Curtain drops*Scene 2:*Curtain Rise*Setting: A small school sized library is set up. Front desk is set stage right. Teacher A stands behind the desk with a stern look on his face, while K stands in front of it holding the rent pieces of her book.K: I’m so sorry…. I’ll replace it…. Where can I find another copy like this one? K is sobbing uncontrollably. Inspiration: she is crying in a way indicative of a far greater loss than a bookTeacher A: You cannot just replace a library book, K, that is not how it works. I have to report it as destroyed and put a charge on your student card. Teacher A shuffles some books together absentlyK: Can’t I just pay it directly? I mean...*sob* I wasn’t even the one who destroyed it. Teacher A: This book was your responsibility. Your family must be notified and made to pay $60.00 for it. This is destruction of school property and we take that very seriously. K: sobbing quietly ... Okay. Stares down at the floor*Curtain drops*Review Time, Ladies & Gents!!!At the risk of going over my allotted review space for this book I'm going to keep the actual review portion short and sweet, hopefully. Jane Eyre is a classic which became such for a reason. Bronte speaks to the feminist within me, and while there are many elements which send that slumbering tiger to potential rage (often Rochester speaks down to Jane in a nature which would, by today's standards, be seen as degrading) there is a wonderful through-line of feminine strength and equality here that belies the time in which Bronte wrote it. This is a story of brutality, prejudice and hardship; of the different ways which life can hammer away at a person's soul. It is about what it takes to love yourself enough to stick by your moral beliefs even in the face of pain and loss. It is also a story of impossibly beautiful love, and what it costs to love beyond what society may comprehend as rational. This is a love of the soul, a love that will endure despite all obstacles, beyond any space of time or distance. The prose is lush and gorgeous to read, Bronte understood the subtle and sweet art that words can use to wind themselves around a reader's heart. Feeling without judgement is a washy draught indeed; but judgement untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition. Category: A Book You Did Not Finish."

In a year where I cried a lot (lol) what a comfort to visit with my favorite quiet yet passionate heroine. I love Jane more and more the older I get. My journey with Rochester has been that-- a whole journey. From seeing this as a strict love story in my teens, to writing off Rochester in my 20's to now just seeing a tragedy in all parts of this story. Listen, I'm not defending keeping a woman in the attic. I'm saying I was sad this year, so when I read Jane Eyre, I read a bunch of sadness. [May 1, 2017] Marking for reread. How does this story keep getting so much better with time? [January 31, 2015] Marking for re-read.I first read Jane Eyre some 12 or 13 years ago. I picked it up in high school and instantly feel in love with the story and with reading in a way I had nearly abandoned during my middle school years. Each time I read it, once every year or two, I find more and more to love. This book is coming home. This book is a pair of well worn pants. This book is the back of my hand and a never ending well of emotions. Each visit adds more into that well, perhaps to be withdrawn at some other date by some other version of myself. This re-read, I took so much joy in the details I often skipped over as a younger reader. I was desperate for action scenes, for the interactions between Jane and Rochester that painted a growing relationship. Now, I immersed myself in the scenes, the details of Thornfield and of Moor House and dreams and half-visions. I love Jane so much. There is a lot about her character that I wish people would see in me, solid but passionate, quick but disciplined, funny, sometimes sarcastic, and just so damn strong, despite her lot in life.I started 2015 with such a bang and busy life times made me fall into a bit of a reading slump. I picked this up because I knew, no matter what's going on, this is a book I will enjoy."

215,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66054863-anthea-syrokou,Rating 5 out of 5,"Jane Eyre is a magnificent classic, and one of those novels that is not easily forgotten. There is no doubt that many situations in the novel reflect the author’s life: her occupation as a governess, spending some of her school years at boarding school with her sisters, who were struck by illness because of the ghastly conditions at the school, and even the aggressive attack Jane endures in the beginning by her cousin, John Reed. Apparently this attack has similarities to a real life incident that had occurred in the author’s life. However, Charlotte Bronte weaves these real-life experiences masterfully, to create an endearing, eery, romantic, and thought-provoking read. And of course, like in many of these novels, there are brooding, assertive, leading men in it as well. I was especially drawn to the main character, Jane, and I developed a warmth in my heart as she revealed her inner feelings, and reflections about her surroundings, nature, the dispositions of many of her acquaintances, and life in general. I developed a deep connection with her, and at times, had to remind myself that this was written so far back, in the Victorian era. Even so, many of her thoughts triggered some type of connection with the character, and an understanding. I felt that had I known the character, Jane, in person, I would have been good friends with her. I also found many of the writing techniques that the author uses in her writing to be very effective, and endearing, such as when she has the protagonist, Jane, speak directly to the reader and refers to the reader as ‘reader’. I was caught off guard often; it was like a pleasant surprise, and I felt even closer to her because of it. One of the things that I found odd as a reader was Mr Rochester’s insensitivity to some of the other characters, namely the child he took into his care, Adele, and of course, Jane, who was her governess. He seemed to be too self-indulgent in his own plight, and although he did his best to ensure that his dependants at Thornfield Hall, were looked after, danger was lurking around them, and he didn’t even warn them about this; that they could be faced with impending and grave danger if they did not take precautionary measures. The only reason tragedy was avoided in most cases, was because Jane had to find things out on her own, and then she took it upon herself to avoid disaster. I found this very selfish and odd; to know of danger and not forewarn any of the people he claimed to care about. Of course, an air of mystery, and ethereal elements were purposefully included to create suspense, so in light of that, I can see why there would be no warning to Jane about her living conditions, as this would not create the suspense and eeriness the author intended to create. It does weaken his character though.Another issue is that, at times, more foreshadowing could have been used, as events seemed to occur randomly, and the explanations were not as strong. Religion also plays a great role in this novel. I think with many novels that are based on a particular era, this can’t be avoided completely, as we cannot pretend that it wasn’t a great part of society, and that many in the day were largely influenced by religion. This is reflective of the time, the Victorian era, in this example, and it seems that the church was connected with the governance of the country. In fact, many churches were built at the time and there was a resurgence of religious beliefs, which would have impacted every day life significantly. Some may feel that it preaches to the reader, however, I personally found that although religion is mentioned throughout, it also demonstrates how religion can be exploited by some and used to serve their own purposes, or to hide their own insecurities and fears, and project those fears onto others. We see at the boarding school, Lowood Institution, where young Jane is a student, that the director of the school, and some of the teachers, used the fear of God as a way to discipline, and inflicted pain on many students. It seems that for so many of these teachers, it was too difficult to be creative and find a different way to discipline their pupils. In contrast, some of the teachers chose to use religion in a positive way. Those teachers focused on how the students can ameliorate their skills and learn to be kind, generous, and studious, by using religion as a way to motivate them, to improve themselves and to find meaning and purpose; not as a way of causing shame and self-loathing, and thus, repression, submissiveness, and conformity. Similarly, we also see how Jane challenges religion when it is used in a negative light, and looks for answers from religion in a wise and intelligent way — not naively, or without using her own mind as well. Jane Eyre is a quiet rebel despite being religious; one who did not conform to the expectations of society. She did have a mind of her own and despite her religious teachings at the school, I think she relied on her instinct a great deal.  Another thing that struck me by reading this novel was that superficial beauty was very important to people. It seems that it was even more disadvantageous to not be bestowed with natural beauty in that era than it is now (if that’s possible) and many would just point out the imperfections of those that were considered to be “less handsome” than their counterparts, as though it was perfectly fine to do so. Of course, what constitutes beauty differed throughout the times.  The author’s use of language is also very clever, rich, poetic and beautiful, and demonstrates a great ability to use language to invite deep thinking about human nature. We see how much the author understood the workings of different types of people through the exchanges Jane has with Mr Rochester, as well as with St John, and other characters; revealing how deeply she understood the human character. Her use of dialogue is very effective in showing many complex layers within the characters. It’s obvious the author had great respect for the English language and was able to use it intelligently and eloquently. We also get a glimpse of the horrid conditions many orphaned children were faced with. It is heartbreaking to contemplate what they went through, and many go through now. Similarly, the injustice for women, and their lack of inheritance is highlighted. Of course, in today’s world, the novel may even be labelled as “over-written”, and “too descriptive”. However, in the setting and time that it was written, life was a lot slower, and people had time to play with words and reflect on nature; to find ways to express themselves with words in everyday conversations, and to delve deeper and find meaning. I personally welcome this as it is refreshing to have characters use language in a way that does it justice. Her sentences and reflections may be lengthy but they are in no way wasteful or loquacious. They always set a mood, a scene, encourage reflection, and give light to many underlying characteristics. The beginning of the novel which is all about Jane’s childhood and what she went through helps the reader understand why she feels the way she does, and it gives us a deeper understanding of how society worked.  And of course, the novel also offers plenty of romance although it is slightly subdued, implicit, and unpredictable. I for one love the feeling of not knowing if the brooding handsome, or not so handsome man, will seek solace and love from a protagonist who isn’t as handsome as some of his other female acquaintances; that the leading woman is above all that in his eyes, and that he might see the beauty reflected from within; in her soul, and from her insightful mind. We have seen time and time again, that these ingredients can definitely be a winning formula. This is the first time I read this novel, and had only read work from the author's sister, Emily Bronte. Overall, the novel was beautifully written, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I’m glad to have met Jane Eyre, and to be introduced to Charlotte Bronte’s writing and to her insightful mind."
216,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18181298-tristram-shandy,Rating 4 out of 5,"“Reader, I married him.”In a way, you could summarize pretty much of this novel in this the first sentence of its final chapter, and what’s more, you somehow know from the very first encounter between Jane and Mr. Rochester that the plotline of the novel, and its two protagonists to boot, will eventually be nicely tied up with and in the holy bond of matrimony. There is nothing really surprising about the plot, at first sight, and that is probably why I have postponed reading Jane Eyre for nearly forty years.On the other hand, Jane Eyre is one of the very widely-read classics here on GR, boasting more than 1.4 million ratings (and 35,258 reviews). Of course, these mere numbers do not say anything about the quality of a book, since one of the best books ever written, Moby-Dick only has 436,060 ratings (and 12,959 reviews), whereas Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice counts about 2.5 million ratings (and 55,240 reviews), and the most surprising thing is that most readers seem to like Austen’s literary thimblerig, not caring that there is not even one pea of honest involvement on the author’s part in Jane’s game. This is different with Charlotte Brontë, as shall be pointed out in a moment.For I could also choose another quotation for a headline, namely the warning words given to little Jane by her moody nanny Bessie, on Jane’s being sent to Lowood School:”If you dread them they’ll dislike you.”Advice like this, given by a servant to a little girl, in a Victorian novel, definitely implies that this novel might have a secret agenda. Many readers point out that Jane Eyre already makes a strong case for feminism and the equal treatment of women, and indeed there is this famous passage about puddings and stockings, which despite its being so well-known I am going to insert here, anyway, for the sake of convenience:”It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity; they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm generally; but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.”Unlike an Austen character, Jane Eyre not only thinks like that but also acts on these principles in that she is never satisfied with a situation she has accommodated herself in – e.g. her position as a teacher at Lowood School – but strives to explore what is beyond the ken of her present sphere of action and not merely faces but actively seeks new challenges:”I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.” In Victorian times, however, these challenges were few and far between for a woman of Jane’s accomplishments and of her middle-class background, and that’s why from a teacher she turns into a governess, which makes the novel one of the countless representatives of the governess novel thriving in the first half of the 19th century. We also witness our heroine patiently bear the ill-concealed contempt and the impertinent jibes of Miss Ingram and her mother, but we know that Jane is not led into apparent submission by mere meekness but by the knowledge that there is more intelligence, feeling and dignity in herself than in any of the women choosing to look down on her. By the same token, Jane also displays courage and recklessness at certain moments of her life, as can be seen very early in the novel when she clashes with her hateful cousin John, and later, a mere eight-year old, stands up against her resentful aunt Reeds. She may be led on by the knowledge of having dared so much already that there is nothing to lose, in these situations, but to resist at all, takes a certain amount of pluck and spirit, but she also feels the darker side of her newly-won freedom:”Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.”It was the skill and care with which Charlotte Brontë depicted her main character which made me read the first half of the novel with bated breath. Here was a female character with real life in her, with passion and impatience, and not a self-denying, whimpering puppet of passivity, which Victorian writers quite often deemed the appropriate role model for their female readers.So I guess that Jane Eyre is definitely a novel that has paved the way for emancipation, but I even see something more in it, something that, in our day and age, we tend to grow negligent of, namely the need to negotiate between false pride, true sentiment, and our dignity. Some readers may find Jane Eyre more or less prim or even priggish what with all the moral sentiment she has to offer and with her refusal to go away to France with Mr. Rochester, not as his wife but as his … companion, although she loves him. Why she still loves him, after all the false play he has been up to and the prolixity with which he declares himself the victim of circumstances, may be a different question, but there is no accounting for love, although lots of love for accounts. Well, but if she loves him, why does she not simply indulge in her passion and leave Thornfield Hall in Mr. Rochester’s tow? Is it simply because of social rules and socialites’ propensity to tongue-wagging? Is it because of several of the Ten Commandments, which would have been infringed upon if she had given in to Mr. Rochester’s proposal? I don’t think so because after all, Jane still loves Rochester after he has been exposed as a bigamist, and she also loves him although she knows that he has had a row of mistresses in his journeys through Europe. Therefore, there is hardly any prudery nor any false pride acting upon her, but neither is she willing to give in to her heart’s desire and calling this real freedom because … it’s not. And this is probably also one of the general misunderstandings of our age, particularly of the Snowflake Generation: Giving in to our heart’s desire or to the whisperings of our craving for comfort is not freedom at all! Freedom is in the actions we take when we have considered all the conditions and the consequences of our options and then decide with a view to what makes most sense. In this spirit, Jane recoils from Rochester’s vociferous vows of love because, as she says, she knows that, were she to concede to being his mistress, he would one day have grown tired of her. It is here true sense of her own dignity that weighs over her blind passion – but even though she is sensible she is able to experience and foster her feelings.In short, Jane Eyre, to me, is the example of how a responsible, dignified person should live and act, of how to balance Reason and Sentiment. It is, therefore, a really valuable and rewarding book to read.There are some things that make it difficult to muster up enough patience at all times, for example the sometimes cliché-laden language, the improbability of Jane’s getting a coach with no particular aim and then ending up with her long-lost relations, the religious cant in the last third of the book, the pat ending where all falls into place (I’m sure Rochester may eventually grow another hand), and the lengthy conversations between the two lovers as well as those between St. John and Jane in the second half of the novel. Still, all those drawbacks cannot really destroy the evident merit of this book and dissuade me from my impression that Charlotte Brontë must have been an extremely intelligent, perceptive and worthy-to-know woman."

“—Toda la melodía de la tierra se concentra para mis oídos en la lengua de mi Jane, y me alegro de que no sea muda por naturaleza, y solo puedo sentir los rayos del sol en su presencia.”
Nunca esperé terminar amando este libro tanto como lo hago ahora mismo, pero sucedió sin que me diera ni cuenta. Se ha transformado en uno de mis favoritos y permanecerá en mi corazón. ¡Que historia más preciosa!Jane Eyre ha sido una lectura muy especial para mí por varias razones. Iniciando por la construcción de los personajes, quienes tienen una parte oscura muy presente y viven creyéndose no merecedores de la felicidad y, al mismo tiempo, anhelándola hasta los huesos. Ambos protagonistas son muy apasionados y sienten profundamente; sin embargo, su visión de la vida difiere completamente. Por un lado, tenemos a Jane, manteniéndose fiel a sus principios y refugiándose en Dios mientras tantea sus alrededores en busca de emociones. Admiré mucho su fortaleza y el control que ejercía sobre sí misma, su capacidad para adaptarse a todo fue completamente asombrosa. “A mí me importa lo que hago. Cuanto más solitaria, sin amigos y sin apoyo, más me respetaré a mí misma. Observaré la ley de Dios, sancionada por el hombre. Sostendré los principios que seguía cuando estaba cuerda, antes de estar loca como lo estoy ahora. Las leyes y los principios no son para los momentos en los que no hay tentaciones; son para momentos como este, cuando se rebelan el cuerpo y el alma contra su severidad. Son rigurosos, pero no los violaré. Si pudiera incumplirlos según mi conveniencia personal, ¿Qué valor tendrían?”Luego tenemos a Edward Rochester, mejor conocido por su amargura y sarcasmo. Es descrito como poco agraciado, aunque destaca por sus numerosos talentos y su inteligencia. Entendía los motivos por los que buscaba escapar, pues si bien siempre ha sido rico de posesiones, se le notaba vacío por dentro. Jane y él son tan opuestos que no podía imaginar un escenario donde encajaran bien juntos..., y aquí estoy, adorándolos como pareja. Se notó con cada escena la profundidad de sus sentimientos y la entrega total hacia ella. ¿Jane merecía a alguien mejor? Probablemente, pero siento que ambos pueden hacerse mucho bien y aprender el uno del otro. Otra razón por la que amé este libro fue el final agridulce que nos dio, puesto que cerró perfectamente la historia y la hizo sentir más real. Sufrí y me hizo feliz a partes iguales, pero más que nada me dejó satisfecha y eso es todo lo que puedo pedir. La pluma de Charlotte Brontë transmite muchísimo y se siente muy personal, casi como una conversación entre amigos. Su estilo de escritura me encantó en su totalidad y contribuyó a mi disfrute lector. Ya me muero por leer los libros de sus hermanas. No tengo ninguna queja con este libro, todo estuvo en su lugar y los temas abordados fueron resueltos a la perfección. El toque oscuro y los plot twists le suman aún más puntos. ¡Recomendadísimo!"

Just saying. 10/5/2017God, I love this book. Although I must say, it gets a little funnier every time seeing all the servants be like ""Sooooo does the governess know or nah??"" whenever Jane is around. Like, sure, they don't know quite how a certain character fits into the picture, but they do know that the certain character exists. So. (Everything I said in 2013 stands)24/12/2015I think I said pretty much everything I need to last time around. All of that still rings true. And I still adore this book.10/11/2013I first read Jane Eyre in January 1998, because I was always the nerdy kid who read her school books in the summer holidays. I studied it a second time two years later, and have been rereading it pretty much annually since then. I'm a sucker for a good bildungsroman and this one fits the bill in spectacular form.Jane is a brilliant character. She's wild and impulsive and fiercely independent where society expects her to be the complete opposite. She stands up for her feelings and her beliefs, even when it lands her in hot water. And she's constantly written in a way that emphasises that Charlotte Bronte would have dug feminism like whoa (""Reader, I married him"" springs to mind. Not ""he married me"". ""I married him.""). The male characters I'm increasingly uncertain about. I've been writing recaps of Buffy the Vampire Slayer for snarksquad.com over the course of the past year and a bit, and recently we've been doing season 6. Spending about three hours with each episode and dealing with the comments sections has seriously impacted on the way I view a certain relationship, and as a result my douchebaggery radar is in permanent overdrive. As a result, the way I view the male characters of Jane Eyre has changed this time around. Brocklehurst is a condescending, pompous asshat. St. John is cold and harsh and unmoving, putting what he sees as his calling above the happiness of himself and everyone around him. And Rochester is kind of a dick. He could easily have divorced Bertha - all a man had to do was prove adultery, and he tells Jane that Bertha was unfaithful - but instead he kept her a prisoner. Yes, he ensured she was well treated and paid for her expenses, but she was still a prisoner. He repeatedly tells Jane that he's going to marry Blanche and asks what she thinks, knowing full well that he has no intention of doing so. He treats Adele like crap a lot of the time, and he tries to persuade Jane to run away with him and be his mistress. As Jane herself says, ""he would have loved me well, for a while"". Despite all of that, I still love this book, and get something new out of it every time I read it."

“i am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at god's feet, equal — as we are!”

jane eyre, or: the book in which jane firmly tells edward rochester what’s up. that’s it; that’s the story.i jest, of course, but i must admit that this is another one of those classics that pleasantly surprised me with how forward and cutting its dialogue could be. where austen is all clever witticisms with a dash of sarcasm, brontë swerves from enchanting, autumnal prose for the descriptions to unflinching honesty whenever jane opens her mouth.which leads to some very interesting explorations of religious philosophy, women’s agency, and jane’s own principles -- as well as the two romantic leads telling each other in a rather deadpan manner that they’re both hideous while then proceeding to flirt without pause.that’s goals right there.the story of jane eyre is a deceptively simple one: orphaned and abused by her only living family when she is young, jane is considered a somewhat strange and rebellious character. she’s sent off to the lowood institute, a school for poor and orphaned girls, and manages to survive its abysmal food, care, and horrible teachers.once she becomes an adult, she departs from the institute in search of a job, advertising her skills as a governess. that is how she ends up at thornfield hall -- and with edward rochester, the man whose ‘protege’ adèle she’s supposed to take under her wing.of course, she and rochester tentatively grow closer, but the man is hiding skeletons in his closet the size of which soon drives a wedge between them. i mean, this is gothic literature, so it won’t do without a bit of disturbing mystery, right?

this book is a long, in-depth bildungsroman from a first person perspective -- revolutionary for its time, and still interesting to read right now. in true character study / exploration fashion, it is somewhat slow and it meanders. i initially thought it might have been serialized due to its pace.we are with jane from childhood to adulthood, watching her grow up, and reading all of her inner musings on what life has to offer. and those are interesting. because jane often ponders upon christian morality and equality, as well as the depths and breadths of her own feelings and soul. i loved how philosophical and literary this all felt, and how brontë often evoked the moon as a symbol for jane’s independence and agency.she could have quite easily become a Not Like Other Girls archetype -- which was skirted dangerously close to sometimes, especially when comparing her to charming socialite blanche ingram -- but so much emphasis is put on jane sharing her ‘quirks’ with others.she and rochester, both outcasts in their own way and with tempestuous characters to match, are constantly presented as kindred souls. they both see an understanding in the other because they are cut from the same cloth; true equals meant to be together.and jane’s thoughts about depth of feeling and the need for goals, drive, and life, she purposefully extrapolates to women in general. every single time a man crosses a boundary with her -- both rochester and st. john, in this case -- she stands her ground and refuses to give a single inch. and the women in her life support her in doing so, such as st. john’s sisters.it was also very refreshing to read such openly (proto)feminist thought in a classic novel.now, as for mr. edward rochester -- so dramatic! so moody! so ridiculously horny for jane that he dresses up like a fortune teller to figure out whether she likes him! utterly devastated and sobbing whenever she tells him what’s what! devastatingly hideous and with a secret to match!© Kate Beaton (click for a better resolution!)it’s funny, because i did end up liking him quite a bit -- not for being a brooding, byronic hero but rather for being somewhat of a lovestruck dumbass. he’s constantly making foolish decisions because he’s so utterly head over heels with jane; this principled spitfire of a woman that remains unfazed at whatever ridiculousness he throws her way.quite daring, by the way, that brontë managed to weave sexual tension into the story. you can definitely feel it sizzling below the text, even if it is quite innocent compared to the steamy stuff that’s being published these days.
 “good-night, my --” he stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.
an instant favorite was the prose. even more so than the mysterious secret haunting the halls of thornfield hall, the descriptions of the environments evoke a gorgeously lush gothic atmosphere. you can just feel the loneliness, the desolation; the slow-winding connection of two kindred souls coming together upon the moors.this really IS the sort of book that is perfect for reading by the fire while the rain clatters against the windows and you’ve got your favorite hot beverage in your lap. i can easily imagine rereading this every now and then whenever october rolls around.so what was not good about this book?take a seat and strap in. remember that feminist thought that permeates the entire novel? which makes the book feel refreshingly modern even to a current-day audience?well, jane’s perceptions of anything that is The Other has not aged well. at all.adèle, the young girl jane is presiding over as a governess, is french and has an opera dancer for a mother. jane often thinks that though adèle is polite and kind, she’s not very bright, and likely won’t amount to very much. to bring up a particular quote:
 “… not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to stray when noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an english mind.”
 and i’m sorry, i just lost it. the british superiority is strong with this one! so strong, in fact, that not only the colonized are looked upon as inferior, but also the french :’)there is also the matter of a character of mixed creole heritage in the story depicted very poorly in direct relation to their heritage / origin. i’ve seen some discussion online on whether this character is actually a person of color or someone merely ‘associated’ with a british colony, but regardless of whether it is the true heritage or the association -- it is decidedly considered BAD by both jane AND rochester.i am of course talking about bertha mason, rochester’s mentally unsound wife that he’s been hiding away in the attic the entire book. she’s portrayed in such an ugly, bestial way, literally crawling on the floor on all fours while being described as ‘savage’ by jane.rochester puts particular emphasis on insanity running in her family line -- funnily enough, her brother appears completely sane -- and that he was tricked into marrying this beast of a woman whose creole mother and grandmother were apparently also destined to become insane.reader, perhaps i should not be shocked by a novel published in 1847 portraying such supremacist, colonial beliefs -- but goodness me, if this did not remind me of all the discussions i’ve had about white feminism over the years!in conclusion: jane eyre is a classic for a reason, and it has much to offer for those out there who enjoy deep character explorations with an enchanting, gothic atmosphere. it also provides an interesting social commentary, and has a distinctive literary slant (plenty of hunting for metaphors, symbols, themes, and motifs!).but, inevitably, it also has its drawbacks: it’s rather slow and dense and meandering, and some parts of it have not aged as well as others.still, i was firmly rooting for jane to have the happy life she wanted; especially if that included a certain hideous husband.✎ 3.5 stars."
220,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42636932-joe-krakovsky,Rating 4 out of 5," I loved and hated this book. It was long and boring in parts where nothing happened. Being an action junkie, reading four pages of a description of someone's character, with more words than I care to look up in one paragraph, I was tempted to throw the book aside. And though I admire those who can speak French as a second language, having the characters speak lines without a translation is maddening. And what is with that habit they had back when the story was originally written to leave blanks such as ___shire, town of ___, county of ___!  On the other hand, I admire the writer's mastery of the English language. Half the words used would not even be in a current dictionary. I don't even know if you can Google it. To think that such a tale could be written without modern spell check, cut & paste and etc. is a sign of a great story teller and a brilliant mind. To those who love reading and learning about history without the politically correctness lying and distorting the truth I would say read it! Sure, it could be a hard read, but if you take the time, you would probably enjoy it."

A dying father extracts a death bed promise from his sister to raise his infant daughter, Jane Eyre. The sister, a spiteful and mean spirited woman grows to hate the obligation that Jane represents and soon sends her away to a boarding school. (Did anyone else have flashbacks to Charles Dickens' NICHOLAS NICKLEBY when they were reading this portion of the novel?) In spite of the harsh mental and physical cruelty she endures at the hands of the school's administrator and its teachers, Jane survives to become a teacher at the school. Ultimately she leaves to seek her own way in the world and secures a position as governess in the household of Edward Fairfax Rochester.At this point, most readers will correctly guess that Jane and Mr Rochester fall in love with each other but to tell more of the story would be to spoil the effect of this magnificent novel for first time readers.Suffice it to say that Charlotte Brontë has woven an enthralling story into the exploration of a multiplicity of themes that will occupy students of the English language novel for decades to come - the interplay of self-respect, morality, conventional mores and religion; the effects of social standing and class discrimination; gender relations in a patriarchal staunchly male-dominated society; legal issues of the day that related to marriage, inheritance and ownership; contrasting extremes of religious zealotry as displayed by Brocklehurst's hypocritical Puritanism reflected against St John Rivers' obsessive but well-intentioned determination to spread Calvinist dogma as a missionary abroad.While many of these issues have clearly been relegated to the history of the 19th century, it's also a fact that much of the controversy that Brontë has so eloquently built into her characters' lives persist as issues into our own 21st century. Little wonder that JANE EYRE has such enduring power in the world of English literature!Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"

Fui completamente às cegas e não esperava gostar tanto. Assim que começamos o livro, queremos ficar na companhia da Jane, descobrir como é que esta menina se vai tornar numa mulher, queremos ser amigas desta personagem maravilhosa. A Jane sempre teve um temperamento muito forte, têm sempre uma resposta na ponta da língua e não se deixa ficar.Jane Eyre é uma protagonista super forte e determinada, que pelo seu passado tinha tudo para ser amarga e pessimista. No entanto, Jane é resiliente, uma personagem icónica, um espírito-livre.Na minha opinião, a parte do romance foi a mais aborrecida. Não morri de amores pelo Mr. Rochester, achei bastante estranho a diferença de idades entre os dois e de ninguém se importar com isso, mas adorei os diálogos entre ele e a Jane, alguns fizeram-me soltar umas belas gargalhadas.Gostei muito também do mistério que acompanha toda a trama e adorei três personagens que aparecem a meio. O final, depois de tanta reviravolta, está em concordância com os pensamentos da Jane, mas fiquei surpreendida comigo mesmo por ter gostado tanto de como acaba. Para ser honesta, quando entendi como ia acabar, pensei que ia odiar... mas a mestria da Charlotte Brontë fez-me gostar muito. E adorei tanto, tanto, tanto ler 'Jane Eyre'.O livro aborda temas como os padrões de beleza, religião, saúde mental e feminismo. Trata da situação sócio-económicas das mulheres, com críticas bem directas à sociedade da altura. Para mim, foi surpreendente ver o feminismo ser abordado num livro publicado em 1847.Fiquei a admirar profundamente a Charlotte Brontë e com vontade de conhecer mais acerca da autora para ter conseguido ter escrito uma história tão impactante quanto 'Jane Eyre' ❤Sinto que não escrevi nem metade do que queria, mas sem dúvida que este livro entrou para a minha lista de favoritos da vida."

Jane Eyre now also holds a special place in my heart. Charlotte Bronte is, just as her sister(s), a remarkable writer, haven composed such a profound work at a young age. I had so many emotions reading this novel and loved (almost) every page of it. I adores the charcter developments, the progress of the plot and the mixture of gothic fiction and romance. I also found the analysis of the different themes (differences between sex & classes, feminism, love, gothic, religion, etc.) in this novel particularly interesting. This is truy a classic and lives up to its reputation. "

236,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37374526-classic-reverie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read Jane Eyre years ago & was ready for a re-read. This classic is an inspirational story about a young girl who is made an orphan early in life and her trials & tribulations from 10 years old & on. Jane finds out early in life that being plain & dependent on others is not a welcomed position. She does however remain strong in her desire to go the path of spiritual & moral uprightness. Can she be loved for herself even though many would not call her pretty? She has an inborn spirited temper when treated unjustly which she learns how to control with the help of some friends at her school. Jane Eyre's experience as a child in a orphaned school seems to have some similarities with Charlotte Bronte & her sisters where there they attend after there mother's death. The death of two of the Bronte daughters from tuberculosis which are likely from the school's poor conditions. Jane Eyre has a religious theme throughout with many quoted Bible verses which does not make this a religious book but more in the lines of a classic which delves into life on earth & the hereafter. I find this very inspirational & interesting coming from Charlotte whose father Patrick Bronte was a clergyman out living all his children. Another theme is the social class & male dominated society. I find Jane not particular happy about being dependent but not so much so that she would forgo love & want of marriage. If you have read Jane Eyre & want more detailed thoughts let me know otherwise I rather not spoil this read for those that have not. A couple more thoughts- I saw the Joan Fontaine & Orson Wells movie version many years ago before reading Charlotte's masterpiece & found out like always even though this movie was a work of art IMO but the book is so much more & does have a different spin with keeping the main storyline intact. I first read Jane Eyre on public domain from IBooks but this time I bought a 99 cents version which was very helpful with endnotes which had translations, Bible verses & etc making understanding easier.Some lines that I liked.“A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should—so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.""“I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself. I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man. I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not mad—as I am now. Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be. If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth? They have a worth—so I have always believed; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane—quite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its throbs. Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot.”Excerpt From: Brontë, Charlotte. “Jane Eyre.” “Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now. He sees not as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more wisely. I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower—breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me. I, in my stiff-necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to the decree, I defied it. Divine justice pursued its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow of death. His chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever. You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its weakness? Of late, Jane—only—only of late—I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God in my doom. I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker. I began sometimes to pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.”Old Time Radio version _ The Weird Circle - December 25, 1943https://www.oldtimeradiodownloads.com..."
237,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118578359-katja-labont,Rating 5 out of 5,"5+ stars (9/10 hearts). I LOVED this book. Wow. I did not expect to love it so much! I read it several times as a kid and was profoundly impacted by the setting and storyline. Rereading it as an adult, I was impacted by the themes, messages, and characters.Jane Eyre is often seen as a dark book. I, instead, found it very beautiful and hopeful. I loved Jane. She was so wise and strong and loving. Really, she became one of my favourite female characters ever. Her story is so sad and yet it is hopeful too. I would love to be a Jane—so willing to help, so eager to love, so strong in trial, so full of faith. The way she combats suicide and depression, grief and pain, pressure and cruelty to live the life she knows God wants for her, is wonderfully inspiring. Mr. Rochester was another character I loved. I related to his weakness and his desire to do good but his lack of willingness to try to be good. After all, he had a good heart. He could have done any number of things to the woman he was chained with and yet he did do her the best he could—as he thought. I loved seeing his redemption arc so much. And as a man, he was just a very entertaining, fascinating, interesting person…. St. John I strongly disliked. What a hypocritical, supercilious Pharisee. He was a “good” man and yet he was not a good man. He was certain that he and he alone was right. He even tried to play God with Jane. If she had obeyed him, she would have killed herself (no use at all to the Lord) and have run right by her true calling. And he was cruel and harsh to her—while pretending to be as merciful and long-suffering as Christ Jesus. I couldn’t stand St. John. Yet his sisters were lovely! The plot was fascinating. Twisty and unexpected all the way to the end, and so varied—from the luxurious but abusive Reed home to Lowood, first cold and cruel, then warm and nurturing; from Thornfield Hall, so dark and gloomy, haunted by a sinister secret, yet blossoming with love and happiness; to the moors, stern and beautiful, and the little village, simple and hearty… and then, the ending place—damp, lonely, and full of human joy. The messages are wonderful—so many reminders about the seriousness of marriage; about not putting up idols in your heart instead of God; about being yourself but in a holy, temperate way; about true charity, about the foolishness of ranks and caste; about the meaning of true love… While there is sadness and ugliness presented in this book, and Brontë does not shy away from portraying sin (see content list below), everything was well handled and was only used to make redemption and Light stand out. The writing style is simply brilliant and the humour excellent; the other characters are all so alive and varied and interesting; the setting is fascinating and so well detailed… it’s a simply beautiful book with a really beautiful message. Content: drinking; smoking; kissing, touching, hugging, between Jane & Mr. R. before engagement; Mr. R. had many mistresses & an illegitimate child; he tries to get Jane to live with him without being married; attempted bigamy; some language; some theology I don’t necessarily agree with. Recommended age: 18+A Favourite Quote: “I hold another creed … in which I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss. Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end.”A Favourite Beautiful Quote: I saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell and sweep—on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were to them—so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them—wound round my faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.A Favourite Humorous Quote: “What age were you when you went to Lowood?”“About ten.”“And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?”I assented. “Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have been able to guess your age.”"
238,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45178027-antonella-favazza,Rating 5 out of 5,"Al comenzar esta historia, Jane Eyre es una húerfana pobre y solitaria que vive en la casa de sus primos y su tía política, la señora Reed. Allí la pasará realmente mal, será maltrada y apartada del círculo familiar. Tiempo después irá a parar al colegio Lowood, una institución de beneficencia donde podrá educarse pero tendrá que convivir con privaciones, escasez de comida, insalubridad y enfermedes. Ya siendo una jóven maestra abandonará la escuela y tomará el puesto de institutriz de Adéle, la protegida de un misterioso y acaudalado señor, Edward Rochester, amo de una mansión llamada Thornfield Hall. Siendo Jane Eyre un clásico, puedo decir sin miedo a spoilers que Jane, tras conocer a su aristócrata patrón, se enamorará de él perdidamente. Podría asegurar que el corazón de la novela es la historia de amor entre un hombre rico y una mujer pobre. Suena a ""La Cenicienta"", ¿No recuerda a Disney? ¿A los cuentos de hadas? Sí es un cuento de hadas, pero no al estilo Disney. Se asemeja más a los cuentos clásicos. Esta es una historia de amor gótica, oscura, con misterios y secretos. Jane Eyre pretende parecerse a una autobiografía, y la obra está escrita en primera persona. Charlotte Brontë era una grandísima escritora. No solo porque ambienta excelentemente cada una de las escenas que relata (muy al estilo romántico, con descripciones de la naturaleza y el paisaje) sino porque sabe mantener algo que, desde mi humilde opinión, no es nada sencillo. Me refiero a la tensión. Ciertamente esto se ve en los elocuentes diálogos que mantienen Rochester y Jane, en donde simpre hay algo no resuelto, palabras que no están dichas, secretos que no acaban de confesarse. Pero también se puede apreciar en las partes en las que suceden cosas extrañanas en la gótica mansión de Thornfield Hall; está tan bien manejada la tensión que parece que Brontë fuera una novelista del género de terror.Además Jane Eyre tiene EL plot twist de la literatura. Es conocido de sobra, pero no lo mencionaré. Por otra parte, además de la historia de amor entre dos personas hay, lo que yo llamo, una historia de amor propio. Jane Eyre es todo un acierto como protagonista y como personaje. Es pobre y ""fea"" y por esas razones es denostada por la gente que la rodea . Sin embargo, ella aprende que es tan valiosa como cualquiera, a pesar del trato que recibe de los demás . Jane luchará contra las injusticias e intentará ser reconocida como una igual en una sociedad patriarcal y clasista. Buscará obtener el afecto que merece así como también su independencia económica. Siempre priorizará su libertad, ser ella misma y mantenerse fiel a sus principios. Hay debate sobre si esta es o no una novela feminista, yo creo que sí porque a pesar de que algunos valores hayan envejecido mal, lo relevante es que Jane simpre revindica su libertad de acción, tomando sus propias decisiones y obrando siempre según su voluntad (además el hecho de querer tener su propio dinero ya es de avanzada teniendo en cuenta que este libro es de 1847).Tal vez este sea mi libro favorito, pero sé que no es perfecto. No es muy innovador en su estructura, está plagado de ""casualidades"" demasiado convenientes (aunque esto es típico en la literatura del siglo XIX), entre otras críticas que se le suelen achacar. No es de esos clásicos que son una ""novela total"". Sin embargo creo que es perfecto a pesar de todas sus imperfecciones. Muy fan de este libro y de Charlotte Brontë"
239,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17656456-poonam,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is my Book Of the Month- January-February 2017, with GR group- The Reading For Pleasure Book Club, Category: Classic Group Read.Jane Eyre is a strong, independent and extremely likable heroine. Having had a difficult child-hood she still manages to make a decent life for herself.
""Mrs.Reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take my meals alone, while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room.""
She is also very practical and sees not the wealth but the character of the person.
'Do you like him? Is he generally liked?'. 'Oh yes; the family have always been respected here. Almost all the land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the Rochesters time out of mind.' 'Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him? Is he liked for himself?'
-- This statement itself shows the disregard of wealth but importance of good human characteristics.And then there is Mr. Rochester and his 'one of a kind' relation with Jane....
""His changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.""
And then there is the mystery...
""What crime was this that lived incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor subdued by the owner?- what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now in blood, at the deadest hours of night? What creature was it, that, masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?""
The attraction of this book is not the setting, the main protagonist or the romance. As per me it's the mystery and I really regret watching the movie adaptation as I already new the BIG secret. This would have been much more fun to read if I did not know the mystery and the twists ahead.Still this made for a good read and hence the 3 stars."

I can read this book over and over and over again and it keeps getting better every single time and I discover something new that I (mystifyingly) missed the other gazillion times I read it. I love it because I have a soft spot for a good melodramatic story and this is the godmother of all modern melodramatic stories. I love it because the main female character is wonderfully complex and intelligent, something male writers 20 years later were still struggling with (I'm looking at you Victor Hugo. *cough* Les Mis. Ok, and let's be honest, this is still a struggle for modern male authors). AND the dialogue, OH, the dialogue. A masterclass in how to write a well-turned phrase. SUMMARY: Swoon! Best Book Ever"

242,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26480778-phee,Rating 5 out of 5,"Reader.I find myself with an awful lot to say about this book. But rather unsure about how much I can put in to words.My thoughts going into Jane Eyre were that it was some great love story, where an orphan girl who has nothing, finds herself gaining everything when she finds her true love. Imagine my face when, upon finishing this novel, I couldn’t believe how much depth and symbolism, how much emotion and hold, this story would have on me.Now let me start by saying that this book was published over 150 years ago. To discuss the aspects that I want to, I will be mentioning important aspects of the plot which will be considered spoilers. So, if you have not read this book and do not want to be spoiled then you may well want to click away from this review. Just know that I love it and would recommend to any reader, especially those who love gothic novels, and fantasy readers.So firstly I want to comment on the duality of Jane Eyre and Bertha Mason. They mirror each other and although the reader or Jane does not know of Bertha’s existence until well into the story, once you are aware of her, you can’t ignore her importance. They are both caged birds in their own respects. The bird imagery is a theme that is constant in the book. At the beginning of the novel, Jane is reading a book on birds. Both common British birds (a symbol of her character, an average British female), and exotic birds (a symbol of Bertha, whom is foreign and described as exotic). Jane is often called a bird and is constantly feeling trapped. Either by her position of being a woman and poor, or physically being trapped, like In the red room at the beginning of the novel. Again a parallel can be drawn to Bertha, whom is trapped in her cell at Thornfield by Mr Rochester, due to her being mad.Madness was at the time linked with witchcraft and women. Bertha was apparently someone who has unhealthy indulgences and as such needed to be locked away so she could be kept under control. By unhealthy indulgences I think one could assume that as she was from another country, she had different views on sex, marriage and cultural ways of female etiquette. Though she probably was mentally ill, I think she was locked away as she was hard to control and probably didn’t transition well from her normal life, to being the wife of the English gentleman, Mr Rochester. A parallel can again be drawn to Jane, who after being locked away in the red room, begins to see and experience what she believes to be spirits. Indicating again, madness and witchcraft. Another piece of imagery seen throughout the novel is that of the characters being behind a curtain. Jane hides behind a curtain at the beginning of the novel, to avoid her cousin. She is also seen to be hiding behind a curtain when Mr Rochester has his many guests and is flirting with Miss Ingham. Even Mr Rochester himself hides behind a curtain when he spy’s on his mistress. Not forgetting Bertha whom breaks out of her cell at night a couple of times during the novel and spy’s on Jane and Mr Rochester. I also think that it is rather poetic that Bertha sets fire to Mr Rochester’s bed whilst he is sleeping in it. Literally burning the curtains and revealing the true nature of Mr Rochester. That being that he is acting or playing a part, i.e. pretending he is not married. I think in part she was trying to reveal this to Jane at this point. Knowing that the other servants were not sleeping anywhere near by and the only person close to Mr Rochester’s chambers would be Jane, and that Mr Rochester would have to explain what happened to Jane, as he would have known that it was Bertha. I think that this is why she laughs outside Jane’s door. So she would know it was a woman and that she didn’t imagine it.Performance is another common theme. The novel is written as Jane writing her autobiography. She is recounting the events of her life to the reader. She is very aware I think of what she is writing. She refers to the ‘reader’ several times and I think she dresses up several events with imagery. Often in the novel when there is a dramatic scene taking place, Jane writes of how there is a storm raging outside or other such remarks about the weather. How much of what she writes that can be completely believed is up to the reader, as I am sure that as the narrator of her own story, she may well have dressed up certain parts of it. Given that there are many gothic and fantastical elements to the story. Other characters also can be seen playing a part or performing. Helen Burns, Jane’s childhood friend at school plays the role of martyr, angelic and pure she represents faith and goodness, and can be seen as an opposite or mirror image to Bertha. As mentioned above Mr Rochester is definitely one of these. Mr Rochester dressing up both as the fortune teller and during charades. I especially liked it when he dressed up as the fortune teller as there was both a class and gender reversal going on by him pretending to be a female traveller. He also plays other roles such as guardian to his ward and he pretends to be poorer than he is to see if that would affect Miss Ingham’s affection for him. I think that when all is said and done, Mr Rochester is quite the accomplished actor. Though his love for Jane is something that I think is very real. I think that Jane puts on a performance of her own when she interacts with Mr Rochester. She becomes quite confidant and self-assured. She makes jokes and talks to him how a man might. She isn’t the frail, female of most English society when she talks with him. She is quite individual and this is probably why Rochester falls for her so hard. Power and gender roles is another important aspect to this novel. Jane establishes herself as someone quite independent. She has no family to support her so everything she earns, she earns for herself. Once Engaged to Mr Rochester she starts to realise that she will have to give that up when she becomes his wife. He showers her with gifts and jewels despite her insistence that his love is all she desires. In fact she even puts it to him that once they are married, she still expects to work and earn and income, whilst still being his wife. I don’t think that this marriage would have worked for them. I think that Mr Rochester would have continued to spoil Jane and in doing so spoil everything that he loves about her. Her fierce independence would have been ruined and she would have become submissive and plain. He is most pleased when she teases him and doesn’t say the sort of things expected of a woman at this time. Bertha, being a symbol here, the obstacle to Rochester and Jane’s marriage. As not only can they not marry unless Bertha is dead but Jane would have to lock away everything that makes her who she is to truly become Rochester’s wife. Making her in some ways, no better than Bertha.So instead, Mr Rochester must lose his lovely Jane and loses a part of himself. He is much changed the next time Jane and the reader see’s him. In all honesty I thought that Mr Rochester would die before Jane went back to him. In some ways I guess he did. He loses his hand and his eyesight, his home and his loves. He loses a great deal of himself and when Jane finally comes back to him at the end of the novel he is quite a different man. She has her own wealth and complete independence, this is when she can finally marry him. As the roles of gender and power are reversed. She doesn’t have to depend on him anymore in terms of financial means, and yet he will have to depend on her as a nurse and guide due to his blindness. There is still much more I could add to this review and I may well add extra things in here when they spring to mind. But I am so glad I read this novel. I think it will definitely need to be re-read at some point as I have heard that it is one of those books that you get something new from every time you read it. Thank you for those that got to the end of my rambles. I suppose this isn’t really a review, more me getting everything out of my brain so I can try and make sense of what I feel. Evidently that is quite a lot."

“Do you think I am an automaton? — a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much soul as you — and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal — as we are!” 
I don't think there is a whole lot I can say about Jane Eyre that hasn't been said a million times. It's a classic for a reason, and Jane is an iconic figure both as a women and as a character in literature for a reason. This is my first time reading Jane Eyre (though I have seen the movie for it) and I really, really enjoyed it. It is probably my favourite classic I've read. Jane as a character is so interesting, and strong. Being able to follow her story from childhood to adulthood as a reader was really fantastic. I was instantly drawn in by her character, I loved her passion and her strength and her independence. For a character written in the 1800s, she stands remarkably on her own. She struggles almost constantly against the prevailing attitudes toward women at the time, but the way she addresses and deals with them was amazing. I love (but kind of hate?) she's one of the strongest female characters I've read, and she was written so long ago. There was so much to like, aside from the romance. This is about Jane finding happiness in herself and her station and her discovery of family, friends, love and self-acceptance was beautiful. The moment she discovers she's rich and has a family and is so excited made me smile so much because I love her and I was so happy for her. Despite being a classic, lots about this is still really relevant today and I liked that. 
“I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.” 
I really ended up loving this, despite finding the first section a little slow and I understand why so many people call Jane Eyre their favourite character. "

La narrativa de la que hace gala la autora es realmente elaborada, pero no por ello pesada o difícil de llevar, sino todo lo contrarío.Hay que tener en cuenta cuándo fue escrito, y el hecho de que la protagonista sea una mujer con una personalidad muy definida y adelantada para su época. Una mujer educada, con pensamiento propio, independiente y que no tiene ningún problema en decir lo que opina en cada momento.Creo que tuvo que ser un choque para la sociedad de su época.La primera parte del libro, nos habla de la niñez de Jane. Huérfana de ambos padres, es acogida por la mujer de su tío y sus hijos, que le hacen la vida imposible hasta acabar en un internado para niñas sin recursos donde es educada y se potencia sus habilidades. También en dicho internado, destaca por su inteligencia y por su gran personalidad. En la segunda mitad del libro, pasa a ser la institutriz de Adele, la ahijada del señor Rochester. Su vida da un gran giro, ya que su raciocinio, independencia y feminismo, chocan con la mentalidad bastante ""machista"" y autoritaria de su jefe. Pero así mismo, hacen que este se vea atraído por ella.Es esta relación entre ambos, y sus consecuencias, las que llevarán a Jane por diferentes caminos hasta el desenlace final."

It is a coming-of-age journey of the orphan, Jane from the horrors of a Victorian boarding school to her employment as a governess at Thronfield Hall to her romantic entanglements with her 'master' Mr. Rochester. Although Jane Eyre was received with some criticism at the time of publication for portraying a heroine with strong feelings, it shows some popularity still today for it's romantic journey. There are beautiful observations on the pure and transcendental nature of love and the importance of truth - since we know there is more to Mr. Rochester, than he is immediately sharing. In many ways it was a romantic mystery that provided an opportunity for some happiness for two souls that needed a happy ending. Did that work for readers?"

‘Jane Eyre��� is an autographical account of the life of a young orphan girl Jane. She lives with her aunt’s family and they treat her disdainfully. After an incident, she is then sent to Lowood which is a charity school for orphans. Jane stays there, first as a student and then as a teacher. She then leaves the school after accepting a post of governess at Thornfield.There she meets Mr. Rochester, her employer who’s bad-tempered, brooding, unpredictable but also intelligent and kind. Jane is drawn to him but and is totally oblivious to the fact that he carries a dark secret. Now, Jane has to decide what she wants from life and Mr. Rochester when the secret comes to light and threatens her chance at happiness.‘Jane Eyre’ is one of the best-written novels of all time. The writing is beautiful and impressive. It is a mix of a lot of different genres like an autobiography, coming-of-age, mystery, gothic and historical fiction. The events described in the book have a mysterious and supernatural feel to them and create a thrilling and suspenseful atmosphere which was interesting.The story of Jane Eyre is told in the first person by Jane herself. We follow her on the journey from a tender age of ten when she’s lonely and unloved and we watch her grow into an adult who’s capable of standing on her feet and deal with the hardship that befalls her path. Jane is an amazing protagonist. She a woman who has a high sense of self-worth and dignity; she’s searching for love and wants to be treated equally without sacrificing her freedom and integrity.Written in the nineteenth century when women didn’t have the same status as men, Jane sets a great example of feminism and gender equality. She encounters different men in her life who want to control her at some point, and she finds herself in difficult situations that attempt to bring her down. But she manages to deal with them without yielding and sacrificing her beliefs. As much as she wants to be loved, she cannot give up on her principles, so she seeks to live her life on her own terms independently.She’s incredibly brave as she makes a choice to give up everything she’s ever known instead of compromising. She works hard and sticks to her morals and is awarded in the end. I really love and respect her character. She’s an underdog, not much of a looker and had a rough start but she stays authentic to herself. It’s incredibly awesome to follow her on the journey and watch her triumph. ‘Jane Eyre’ is a very compelling and empowering book and it’s one of my favorite novels of all time.
“I can live alone, if self-respect and circumstances require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give.""
 The other thing I loved in the book is the relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester. Their conversations were witty and put a smile on my face. Perfect romance cannot get any more perfect than this! Their relationship gave me fairy-tale vibes. I loved all of their interactions and the way the relationship blossomed between them.Jane Eyre is a very progressive novel, far ahead of its time. Written in the era where women were not encouraged to write, Charlotte Bronte wrote under a pseudonym ‘Currer Bell’ and got her novel published. When she was 20 years old, Bronte sent the English Poet Laureate Robert Southey some of her best poems. He wrote back in 1837, telling her that she obviously had a good deal of talent and a gift with words but that she should give up writing. The Professor, Brontë’s first novel, was rejected nine times before it was finally published after her death. When she published Jane Eyre—her publishers didn’t know Bell was really a woman until 1848, a year after the book was published! From the start, the book was a success—one critic called it “the best novel of the season”—and people began to speculate about who ‘Currer Bell’ was. Now, that’s something interesting!In this context, Jane Eyre is the perfect portrayal of a feminist ideal. That’s the reason it manages to stay relevant even in this era. She’s a girl who’s simple and average looking, yet intelligent and brave and she works hard to earn her keep. She falls in love with a guy who’s way older than her and who’s from a different social class which was generally frowned upon at that time. When she discovers his secret, she wants absolutely nothing to do with it and seeks to find her own identity. She is one of my favorite female protagonists.
“I am not an angel,’ I asserted; ‘and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself. Mr. Rochester, you must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me – for you will not get it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all anticipate.”
Now, as I’ve said earlier I loved this novel and it’ll always be ones of my favorites. But it’s time for me to take off my rose-colored glasses and look at it objectively. I once had an interesting conversation with a friend of mine and many good points came up. First, there’s the age gap. While I know it’s a period piece and ‘age is just a number when it comes to romance’, it still makes me a little uncomfortable. But it’s not such a big deal.Secondly, Jane Eyre who’s supposed to be a strong and independent woman chooses a most ordinary life by marrying Rochester. While some people may believe that’s not very ‘feminist’, I choose to disagree. It’s the same criticism given to Cinderella, Katniss from ‘Hunger Games’ and Hermione from the ‘Harry Potter’ series. Jane Eyre was rebellious and made her own choices within reason.She’s never had someone in her life whom she could call her own. She finds love in Mr. Rochester who deceives her. But, in the end, she chooses to be compassionate and forgiving and ends up marrying him, showing qualities that are feministic. As you know, a strong woman does not need a man to complete her; in the same manner, there’s nothing wrong in choosing to be with someone or choosing a ‘conventional life’. I think people completely miss the point when it comes to feminism.Third and the most important point- the case of Bertha Mason. She’s very crucial to the plot, yet it’s all a mystery when it comes to her. We only know her as an insane and violent person as stated by Mr. Rochester but there’s no single evidence that can prove that, other than his explanation and Jane’s biased opinion.Rochester was drawn towards her by her beauty and pressured by his dad to marry her and similarly, Bertha was pressured by her relatives and was shipped off to a strange land with a strange man and we can only assume, she was driven to madness by the bad treatment she received at his hands or the neglect on his part. It was far easier for him to discard her and confine her due to her gender.Throughout the novel, she never tried to harm Jane but she seemed only angry with the man who did not treat her right and put her in captivity. There can be different interpretations about her character and I did not like the way she had to die in the end unjustified. I feel sorry for her character but there’s nothing we can say conclusively about her situation.That being said, ��Jane Eyre’ is still one of the most ground-breaking works in literature. You’ll have to read and draw your own interpretations from it. I enjoyed reading it immensely and I recommend it to anyone who loves literature.

251,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9693728-ana,Rating 5 out of 5,"Foi Jean Rhys com o seu livro ""Vasto Mar de Sargaços"" que me conduziu à leitura deste clássico da literatura inglesa.""Vasto Mar de Sargaços"" é um título escrito em 1996 onde a autora imagina a história de uma das personagens de Jane Eyre, enquanto prequela, história essa que funciona como ""spoiler"" a este livro. Até o pequeno gesto de ler a sinopse de ""Vasto Mar de Sargaços"" já revela demasiado da história de Jane Eyre pelo que não façam o percurso como eu o fiz. Se tiverem interesse nestes dois maravilhosos livros, primeiro leiam Jane Eyre e só depois o ""Vasto Mar de Sargaços"".Este foi um dos motivos pelos quais Jane Eyre esteve alguns anos na estante a aguardar ser lida: os spoilers. Não só pela leitura de Vasto Mar de Sargaços, mas por ser um clássico tão tão conhecido que é difícil para quem ande neste mundo dos livros partir para ela em desconhecimento total do que se trata. No mundo dos livros e não só! Porque até num videojogo este título me apareceu, no jogo Infamous Second Son onde comparavam Jane Eyre ao personagem principal do livro ""À Espera no Centeio"" de J.D. Salinger. Pensava assim já saber do que tratava o livro e como era a sua história, pelo que pouca vontade tinha de o ler. A edição que tinha na estante também não ajudava a que me sentisse com vontade de o ler: uma edição da Penguin muito velhinha e amarela, algo danificada e com as letrinhas muito muito pequeninas que tinha comprado numa venda solidária (para ajudar amigos patudos) durante umas férias no Algarve há anos atrás (penso que terá sido adquirido em 2014, mas não tenho a certeza).Ainda outro motivo que prolongava o estado ""não lido"" deste livro, era o facto de não ter gostado particularmente do livro O Monte dos Vendavais da sua irmã Emily Brontë, quando toda a gente, ou pelo menos a grande maioria dos leitores, adora este livro. Receava que a minha experiência decepcionante com Emily poderia vir a repetir-se com esta sua irmã.Por fim, foi por causa de um desafio literário que acabei por me aventurar nesta leitura. O desafio, que decorreu no BookTube em Outubro de 2018 (#victober) é um desafio criado pela Katie @ Books and Things que desafia os leitores a lerem livros da Era Vitoriana durante o mês de Outubro. Tive conhecimento deste desafio através de uma booktuber portuguesa, a Bárbara do canal Delicada Como Um Elefante. Achei imensa piada ao video dela sobre este desafio porque apenas com este livro (Jane Eyre) conseguiria cumprir todas as categorias do desafio proposto :), e deu-me assim o ""empurrãozinho final"" para finalmente ""desencalhar"" esta leitura!Que leitura incrivelmente surpreendente e contrária a todas as minhas expectativas! Um livro a que atribuí 5 estrelas, uma das melhores leituras de 2018 e uma das melhores personagens literárias que encontrei ao longo da minha vida de leitora.Adorei esta personagem Jane Eyre. Mais do que o enredo, que não me trouxe assim motivos de grande surpresa ou admiração, foi ela, a protagonista, que fez com que este livro fosse para mim uma das leituras mais memoráveis de sempre. Ao fim de pouquíssimas páginas de leitura, uma Jane Eyre ainda criança entrou no meu coração e apesar de entretanto já ter crescido, ainda não saíu :). Todos os motivos referidos no início deste post e que me haviam feito recuar durante anos perante esta leitura, tornaram-se insignificantes, e alguns desses motivos até sofreram um volte-face: transformaram-se em aspectos positivos e motivadores!Por exemplo o facto de já conhecer grande parte da história tornou-se insignificante, uma vez que não era a história em si mesma que me estava a prender, mas sim a forma como Jane Eyre ia reagindo aos acontecimentos. A estrutura mental desta personagem é impressionante, mesmo desde criança. A forma como ela se vai comportando, como vai enfrentando cada obstáculo na sua vida, como se vai auto-regulando emocional e cognitivamente, como consegue construir-se, decidir a sua vida, manter uma estrutura de pensamento original e única, independente da validação ou dos conformismos sociais, todas estas características e capacidades de Jane Eyre foram para mim deveras impressionantes. E tudo isto sem perder a noção de tudo o que a rodeia e condiciona, do real, da sociedade, do seu lugar, dos seus defeitos e mais-valias, e sem perder a sua sensibilidade, a sua empatia, a sua capacidade de amar, sem nunca perder o que há de mais belo num ser humano. O grau de profunidade instrospectivo presente nesta narrativa fez-me acreditar que muitas das características do pensamento da própria autora tinham sido transferidas para a sua personagem Jane Eyre. Isto fez com que no decorrer da leitura, a minha admiração fosse aumentando, quer por Jane Eyre, quer pela sua criadora, Charlotte Brontë. Quanto à minha edição ser no inglês original, um livrinho de bolso muito antigo, muito manuseado e amarelado, características que antes de começar a ler considerava como possíveis entraves a uma boa experiência de leitura, ganharam todo um novo significado. A meio da leitura tive acesso a uma edição em português deste livro, das edições Romano Torres e verifiquei como se havia perdido do inglês para o português vários aspectos importantes do texto original, e sobretudo a voz de Charlotte Bronte, a sua forma de escrever. Fiquei pois muito feliz por ter acesso ao que ela escreveu de facto e quando leio agora algumas opiniões de leitores que alegam que a escrita de Charlotte Brontë é uma escrita demasiado simples e sem beleza, eu tenho a certeza que não a leram no original. Por tudo o que atrás disse e por muito mais: por ser um clássico intemporal; por ser um dos melhores romances da Era Vitoriana; por ser um retrato da sociedade da época; por falar de temas fortes como o papel da mulher, a hipocrisia da Igreja, as diferenças de classes, etc, etc...por tudo isso também, mas para mim... o melhor motivo que vos posso dar para ler este livro é: conhecerem esta personagem incrível que é Jane Eyre.Nota: Gostei tanto tanto do livro que ia fazer um video de opinião apenas sobre Jane Eyre (até anunciei que o faria no canal), mas a interacção que se proporcionou aquando da leitura deste livro entre eu, a Bárbara e a Filipa (pois todas o havíamos lido ou relido na mesma altura) levou a um ""live"" no Booktube de discussão da obra a três. Tomei a liberdade de colocar no post essa discussão, que está dividida em duas partes, sendo a primeiro sem spoilers pelo que podem ver sem receio pois é alertado durante o video antes de passar a conter spoilers. Também por esta interacção que este livro proporcionou, para além de tudo o resto, será sem súvida um livro inesquecível para mim. Fui tonta em deixar tanto tempo na estante por ler uma obra assim, mas esta interação que se proporcionou nesta altura entre mim, a Filipa e a Bárbara valeram bem todos esses anos ""perdidos"" :).Post completo em:http://linkedbooks.blogspot.com/2019/..."
252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2467655-jo,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Short Review.All you need to know about as to why you should read this book is at the top (or well.. technically the bottom) of this list.The Long Review.I’m going to review this book in comparison to another. And I’m probably going to do both of these books a disservice. Because they aren’t anything like each other… but to me, they come together. After I had been told I HAD to read Wuthering Heights by one of my best friends, I bought a copy and read it during a 5 hour car journey form Edinburgh to Manchester after I had seen my sister graduate. The combination of the sprawling hills and the tempestuous Scottish/Mancunian/Northern England weather provided the perfect backdrop for reading Wuthering Heights and I loved it. It wasn’t an easy book to read, (oh, and it took me a lot longer than 5 hours to read, by the way. Thought I should clarify that!), and I pretty much hated every single character (not because they were badly written, but because they were so well written and they’re not supposed to be liked- passionate, spoilt, dramatic and swoon-inducing, yes. But loveable? Eh, no.) but I absolutely adored the epic writing and descriptions. And it became one of my favourite literary endeavours and one that I have vowed to, when I have atleast two weeks to spare, return to. (On a side note, I have visited Haworth with the intention to climb the hills to Wuthering Heights except, in true Bronte fashion, the weather was ridiculous and we couldn’t make it. One day, I will get up there and not just end up in the Bronte gift-shop with arms full of postcards and leather book marks).Anyway, I should probably write about Jane Eyre now, shouldn’t I? There are no words to describe how much I loved this book. (Well, there are… I texted my aforementioned friend every time I read something that I adored… not looking forward to this month’s bill). I always think of Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre in the same thought. I don’t know why… maybe it’s because they’re the only two books from this era that I have read and enjoyed. So, I think I have to say, when comparing them, I think I loved Jane Eyre sliiiiightly more. For me, Jane Eyre is pretty much the perfect book. It’s amazingly written, it’s utterly and heartbreakingly relatable (the feelings Jane experiences… not the crazy women in the attic. Although, you never know!), and the story is perfect (I’ve seen so many screen adaptations of Jane Eyre and I still found myself being wholly creeped out when we first heard the ‘goblin-laugh’ of Mrs R. *shudder*)Unlike a lot of heroines in books of this era, Jane is likeable and I want to be her best friend. (Sorry, I just don’t like t’other Jane. Never have, never will.) She’s proper without being twee. She’s innocent but she’s not naïve. She can hold her own in arguments when The Roch is being a chauvinistic douchebag, she’s funny but she’s also passionate and fights for what she believes in. Also… the woman is made of stronger stuff than I am. If I was her in the room when Mr Rochester was telling me “You are my sympathy- your better self- my good angel” I would’ve been like.. “Oh screw it… we can just put an extra lock on the attic door and we can live in sexy, sordid sin forever!”But no, Jane puts me to shame and doesn’t get swept away when Mr Rochester unleashes the swoon.And does he unleash the swoon. Which brings me to Mr Rochester- who is possibly THE most ridiculously hot literature creation I have ever read ever. EVER. And I thought Newland Archer was as good as it comes (I still love him though… I think Newland would understand and let me disappear with Mr Rochester for weekends every now and again). He is the perfect combination of passionate, anger, love, lustful, envious, noble, irrational, heroic, vulnerable and so damn cute. And all without being as cracked-out as Heathcliff who, as much as I love him, would get exhausting. I like to think of Mr Rochester as Heathcliff-Lite. But that does not mean he is for the faint-hearted. I’ve only just put the book down and my heart is still beating like a steam train. Mystery, intrigue, gothic, passionate…. Oh, forget it. I could go on forever about this book. JUST READ IT."
253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52917032-tessa-nadir,Rating 4 out of 5,"Unul dintre cele mai celebre romane de dragoste in care realismul epocii victoriene si romantismul gotic se imbina cu succes. Virgina Woolf spunea despre Charlotte Bronte ca nu citim proza ei pentru ""excelentele observatii asupra personajelor"", nici pentru haz caci al ei e ""sumbru si funest"" ci pentru poezia ei. In prefata editiei originale autoarea ne spune ca romanul este dedicat lui William Thackeray ('Balciul desertaciunilor') pe care a avut ocazia sa-l cunoasca si sa-i admire munca.Personajul Jane Eyre este o tanara orfana foarte curajoasa, emancipata, feminista care nu se da batuta in fata sortii si problemelor ce-i apar in cale. La 18 ani ajunge la Thornfield ca guvernanta lui Adele, unde are ocazia sa-l cunoasca pe domnul Rochester, stapanul conacului. Acesta e un om atipic, sumbru, fiind foarte mandru, arogant si intunecat. In ciuda acestor lucruri, ea ajunge sa se indragosteasca de el, insa acesta ascunde un secret, ceva sinistru si tainic petrecandu-se in turnul conacului. In carte se fac foarte multe referiri la Biblie dar si la mari opere cum ar fi ""Macbeth"", ""Paradisul pierdut"", ""O mie si una de nopti"" etc. Am selectat din opera cateva citate interesante:""Sentimentele bune fara ratiune sunt cu adevarat ceva insipid, dar judecata necumpanita de sentiment este mult prea amara si seaca.""""Respecta-te suficient pentru a nu-ti irosi dragostea inimii, sufletul si puterea acolo unde un asemenea dar nu este dorit si va fi dispretuit.""""Nu e bine pentru nicio femeie sa fie flatata de superiorul ei, care nu poate avea de gand sa o ia de sotie.""""Am pretentia doar la superioritatea care trebuie sa rezulte din diferenta de 20 de ani dintre noi si un secol de experienta.""""Daca toata lumea te-ar uri si te-ar crede rea, in timp ce propria constiinta te-ar aproba si te-ar absolvi de vina, tot n-ai fi fara prieteni.""""Nu prin violenta infrangi cel mai bine ura - si, cu siguranta, nici cu o razbunare nu vindeci ranile.""""E o dovada de slabiciune si prostie sa spui ca nu poti sa induri ceea ce soarta iti cere sa induri.""Romanul mi-a placut mai ales prin descrierile minunate, intunecate, gotice ale tinuturilor si conacului, am apreciat caracterul puternic al personajelor si m-au incantat detaliile privind vestimentatia si obiceiurile victoriene. Este fara indoiala o carte ce merita citita si asezata langa celelalte romane celebre de dragoste."

They are stuffy, stiff, superficial and sophisticate, all adjectives that I dislike. As for this story, well, is she walking through Mongolia or kayaking the Arctic? Is she a pioneer woman? No, she is learning to become a lady. And now she is living in a mansion, teaching a little girl how to become a lady as well as schooling her, for she is a nanny, and as a nanny, as in all of these kinds of books, she will fall in love with the owner of said mansion or some other wealthy man. It is the old Cinderella story, but maybe this story came first. You get a proper education, like finishing school, and after you have learned to become a lady and even studied French, you can marry a wealthy man, because it is wealth that is important. It is this type of story that has brought ruin to others. And this style of writing is why I hate classics. It makes them tedious and boring."

Maltratada y despreciada constantemente por su tía y primos, quienes le recuerdan que vive gracias a la benevolencia de ellos. Jane vive una infancia atormentada y, como consecuencia, desarrolla baja autoestima e inseguridad. Dejada a los 10 años en un orfanato, aprende ahí el valor de la amistad, y 8 años después sale para encontrar trabajo como institutriz en una mansión llamada Thornfield, donde conoce al señor Rochester.A pesar de haber sido publicada en 1847, se trata de una novela adelantada a su tiempo, con una protagonista poco convencional, que pertenece totalmente a la época actual: Jane es inconforme, independiente, determinada, racional, íntegra, generosa, fiel a sus principios, valiente y con una fortaleza impresionante. No obstante haber crecido de manera solitaria, nunca renuncia a ser ella misma para convertirse en una mujer paciente y abnegada. En pocas palabras, Jane Eyre es uno de los primeros referentes literarios del feminismo.El romance descrito en la trama no es la típica historia de amor victoriano –porque los protagonistas tampoco no son los típicos héroes de las novelas–, sino una relación que se va construyendo poco a poco, a pesar de los prejuicios sociales.Jane Eyre es también una novela de crítica social: a la interpretación que la iglesia hace de la religión, a las condiciones de vida en los orfanatos, al machismo y a las realidades sociales de la época.A pesar de su extensión, es una lectura ágil, con diálogos interesantes, sarcásticos, graciosos y reflexivos. Además, la dosis de misterio, el ambiente gótico y los giros narrativos la convierten en una historia atrapante. En conclusión, Jane Eyre es uno de esos grandes clásicos de la literatura universal que deben ser leídos al menos una vez en la vida."

Le donne soffrono dell'eccessiva repressione e immobilità, proprio come ne soffrirebbero gli uomini"". Dopo qualche anno dalla prima volta che ho conosciuto e amato Jane, questa rilettura non fa che confermare tutto ciò che ho pensato e provato allora. Jane è un personaggio indimenticabile e piuttosto rivoluzionario per l'epoca e nel corso delle pagine mi è sembrato di ritrovare una vecchia amica che ora mi manca già tantissimo. Ripropongo dunque la mia prima, entusiastica recensione:Bello. Bello. Bello. Capisco perfettamente perchè questo sia il classico preferito di così tante persone. Mi aspettavo tanto da questa storia e non sono rimasta affatto delusa. Mi risulta difficile scriverne una recensione perchè ho appena chiuso il libro, ma sento il bisogno di parlarne e quindi tutto ciò che scriverò sarà il risultato a caldo delle emozioni che questo libro ha suscitato in me. Partiamo dall'ambientazione: paesaggi magnifici, una campagna inglese descritta da Charlotte Bronte in maniera magistrale, come se fosse un dipinto messo lì davanti ai nostri occhi. La brughiera, i boschi, le dolci colline, la pioggia battente, i fiori, gli odori, le maestose tenute aristocratiche britanniche come Gateshead e Thornfield Hall, la durezza, la freddezza del collegio di Lowood, tutto concorre a creare un'atmosfera magica ma allo stesso tempo cruda, reale, quell'atmosfera ""inglese"" che mi ha coinvolto pienamente dalla prima all'ultima pagina. La scrittrice indugia moltissimo nelle descrizioni, si percepisce come ami profondamente dipingere per i suoi lettori ogni dettaglio, ogni particolare tanto che per alcuni potranno risultare quasi un ostacolo all'andamento della storia perchè ovviamente la rallentano un po', ma che secondo me si sposano ad essa perfettamente. Mi è piaciuta molto la narrazione in prima persona, l'ho trovata originale, spontanea e assolutamente in grado di creare un filo diretto tra la protagonista e i lettori, infatti con me ha funzionato sin da subito e mi ha fatto sentire ancora più vicina a Jane e alla sua storia. Ma parliamo dell'assoluta protagonista, del personaggio che anche da solo varrebbe la lettura di questo romanzo: Jane Eyre. Charlotte Bronte ha fatto un capolavoro: ha creato una donna straordinaria che da orfana rifiutata, sola e sofferente si trasforma pian piano in una donna forte, indipendente, ferma nelle sue convinzioni e che alla fine dopo anni di sacrifici, remissività, solitudine va a prendersi il suo meritatissimo lieto fine. Devo dire che sin dall'inizio ho sentito una forte empatia verso Jane, mi è piaciuta da subito, la capivo, soffrivo per lei, la ammiravo, l'ho sostenuta quando ha affrontato la signora Reed con dignitosa risolutezza e mi sono sentita fiera di lei quando a Lowood è riuscita a ritagliarsi un posto da insegnante e ancor di più quando con coraggio ha abbandonato il posto dove aveva vissuto per gran parte della sua infanzia e adolescenza alla ricerca di una vita migliore. Quanto mi si è stretto il cuore a vederla soffrire dopo aver scoperto la verità sul signor Rochester, quanto ho temuto per la sua sorte quando sola e senza un soldo è fuggita col cuore spezzato nella notte senza sapere dove andare e quanto invece ho esultato di gioia al suo ricongiungimento con l'amato Edward. Come fare a descrivere un personaggio complesso come Jane Eyre? Così lontana da quello stereotipo di donna ottocentesca alla costante ricerca di un buon matrimonio e di una posizione nella società. Jane è forte ma allo stesso tempo così fragile, è testarda, fiera ma a tratti docile e mansueta come lo stesso Rochester più volte afferma, così bisognosa di affetto, di amore, di una famiglia che per la prima volta in vita sua possa davvero apprezzarla e questo lo vediamo bene nell'affetto smisurato che riversa su Diana, Mary e St John soprattutto dopo la scoperta del legame di parentela che li lega. Jane non fa leva sulla sua bellezza (anche perchè la Bronte più volte nel corso del romanzo ci ricorda che Jane non è affatto bella, ma piuttosto minuta e con un aspetto nella norma) ma sulla sua intelligenza, sulla sua forza interiore, u quei principi incrollabili che costituiscono la base della sua vita e a cui non rinuncia nemmeno nel momento più doloroso della sua esistenza e che la porteranno col cuore a pezzi ad abbandonare l'uomo che ama. Sono rimasta davvero incantata dal mondo in cui la scrittrice ha saputo descrivere i sentimenti della sua Jane, sentimenti anche complessi, contraddittori, dolorosi, spietati che scuotono la vita della giovane donna che però rimane sempre e comunque fedele a se stessa. La storia d'amore è raccontata magnificamente, niente di sdolcinato, di banale, di melenso, ma una storia fatta anche di incomprensioni, di momenti tesi e di tanta tenerezza. Nell'ultima parte del romanzo questo sentimento esplode in tutta la sua forza, tanto che ho sentito il bisogno di leggere le pagine che raccontano il ricongiungimento tra Jane e Edward ad alta voce, emozionandomi e commuovendomi alla vista di un simile amore così vero, così appassionato, così dolce e incondizionato e quando appena prima della conclusione Il signor Rochester cinge le spalle della sua ""fata"" Jane e si avviano verso casa non ho potuto trattenere una lacrimuccia. Anche il signor Rochester è un personaggio estremamente complesso, così misterioso, spesso duro, tenebroso ma dal cuore buono e il terribile passato che lui nasconde e che verrà fuori sconvolgendo tutta la storia concorre a dare un ritmo ancora più incalzante e irresistibile a tutta la vicenda. Il personaggio che da subito ho detestato è St John: freddo, austero, così' tremendamente cocciuto e incapace di abbandonarsi ai più puri sentimenti. Gli riconosco una forza di volontà fuori dal comune, una grande tenacia nel raggiungimento del suo obiettivo di servire il Signore a tutti i costi, ma davvero il modo in cui si rivolge a Jane chiedendola in sposa non per amore ma solo per usufruire delle sue doti di ""perfetta moglie di un missionario"" mi ha fatto rabbrividire e ho temuto fino alla fine che Jane a causa di quel suo innato spirito di sacrificio si sarebbe fatta convincere dalle parole del cugino, ma invece ancora una volta ha scelto di seguire la via più giusta per lei e questo me l'ha fatta apprezzare ancora di più. Bellissimo e pieno di pathos il momento in cui Jane si congeda per sempre dalla signora Reed e anche qui la ragazza fa ancora una volta sfoggio del suo cuore generoso, della sua dignità e forza incrollabile. Così la nostra piccola Jane dopo anni di amarezza e sofferenze diventa un'ereditiera, una donna coraggiosa, una moglie amorevole, una madre, una sorella, un personaggio che grazie alla scrittura magnifica di Charlotte Bronte diventa indimenticabile. Correte a leggere questo romanzo!""Credete che siccome sono povera, sconosciuta, brutta, e piccola, sia senz'anima e senza cuore? Vi sbagliate! Ho un'anima quanto voi, e un cuore pieno come il vostro! E se Dio mi avesse donato un po' di bellezza e molta ricchezza, avrei fatto in modo che vi fosse difficile lasciarmi quanto lo è per me lasciare voi"""

Jane Eyre
 is considered a classic of English Literature. Here you will read an example of early nineteenth century English writing style with its peculiar English idiom. Here also you will meet a diverse collection of characters. Bronte’s development of the female characters is very shallow, with perhaps the exception of Mrs. Reed whom we meet during Jane’s time at Gateshead Hall. The author’s character development of the three male characters is better, but the characters are not that attractive. There is a heavy religious overtone to this story.Initially I enjoyed reading this book with Jane’s internal dialogue and her conversations with the other characters. I particularly enjoyed her conversation with Helen Burns, a fellow student at the Lowood Institute, about endurance, and the Shakespearean Soliloquy when Jane sits observing Mr. Rochester and the Lady Blanche Ingram after the guests at Rochester’s Thornfield Hall have played charades. But after a while the dialogue and writing became too tedious.After I finished this book I started and am currently reading 
The Making of the President 1960
 by Theodore H.White published in 1962. Now that’s what I consider a classic."

Being in China was the worst, where young women currently derive 98% of their impressions of female Western culture from Jane Austen novels, and are subsequently using slang and household vocabulary from the 18th and 19th centuries, with romantic notions to match. ""Teacher, I cannot come to class because I have chilblains and ague; oh, I suffer so."" And then they swoon over a charged look from a member of the opposite sex, an experience that makes them ""flush and reel with unknown passions."" Luckily, the other 2% seems to come from the Internet, so they dress like Japanese hookers with a fetish for fantasy novels. It's all very confusing.In any event, I realized that, if I am to continue to mock my friends' taste in BBC period specials (12-hour versions of Pride and Prejudice and the like), then I should probably familiarize myself with the material. Lo and behold, I can - without pride, OR prejudice - say that Jane Eyre tore me a new one. Seriously. I was hooked. 545-some-odd pages of wistfulness, swishing skirts, orphanages, and severe Christian morality, and I devoured it in a couple of days. What I hadn't counted on was the deep undercurrent of rebellion that runs through Bronte's work: the unlikely struggle of a woman holding her own against both class and gender inequities, and having her fire and faith in self ultimately rewarded. It doesn't get much better than that! Brava, Miss Charlotte. I'll read more - one of these days.This edition is a great starter-kit for doubters such as myself, as it's illustrated by the self-proclaimed neo-Victorian hipster extraordinaire, ""Dame Darcy,"" a cartoonist with a delightful body of work best typified by Meatcake, and with a jagged, big-eyed style that dances neatly between Tim Burton and an attack of a 12-year-old with a box of markers. "
267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40256937-paul-haspel,Rating 5 out of 5,"Jane Eyre is a heroine for the ages. As created by novelist Charlotte Brontë, for the 1847 novel that bears her name, Jane Eyre tells her own story of travail and triumph in a manner that wins the reader’s sympathy for Jane, and impresses the reader with a sense of Brontë’s storytelling prowess and insight into human character.Charlotte Brontë, the daughter of a curate, was born and raised in Yorkshire, and that grim, cold landscape of moors and isolated towns informs her work, as it does that of her sisters Emily and Anne Brontë – successful novelists all. They grew up in a household where books and literature were valued, cultivated a rich imaginative life together. For Charlotte, Emily, and Anne, writing novels was a logical outgrowth of the life they had built together. It is truly a unique example of a novelistic sisterhood.Charlotte Brontë only lived to be 38 years old, but she achieved literary immortality with Jane Eyre, her second novel. The book begins with Jane living in a state of virtual imprisonment at Gateshead, the household of Jane’s aunt, Mrs. Reed, where Jane is treated neglectfully and often cruelly by her cousins – and by Mrs. Reed, who regularly locks Jane in the house’s “red room,” a form of solitary confinement that the young Jane finds profoundly terrifying. It eventually emerges that Mrs. Reed didn’t want to raise Jane, and that her dying husband, Jane’s uncle, made her promise to do so. Of this difficult and painful time when she lived with her aunt and cousins, Jane says that “Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know not how to express the result of the process in words.”Eventually, it is arranged for Jane to leave Gateshead for Lowood, a charity school run by Mr. Brocklehurst. A man of self-righteous, hypocritical piety, Brocklehurst is the kind of “Christian” who gives Christianity a bad name – quick to criticize and punish, and devoid of compassion and empathy.At Lowood, Jane makes friends with a fellow student, Helen Burns, who sets forth a philosophy of endurance. “It is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the Bible bids us return good for evil.” When Jane tells her of Mrs. Reed’s cruelty, Helen replies that “Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity, or registering wrongs.” She is an important moral teacher for Jane; and as the novel moves forward, Jane demonstrates the ways in which she has taken Helen’s ideas to heart.Eventually, with her education complete, Jane seeks work, and moves to Thornfield Hall, to serve as a governess to Adèle, the ward of the wealthy and aloof Edward Rochester. Jane’s first description of Rochester, when the two have an accidental first encounter during one of Jane’s evening walks around Thornfield, establishes Rochester as a classic Romantic hero: “He had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth, but had not reached middle age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.”As Jane’s time at Thornfield continues – and as her rapport with Adèle makes her quietly indispensable to the household there -- Rochester, from time to time, seeks to engage Jane in conversation. During these conversations, Rochester seems to be pleased by Jane’s willingness to stand up to him, as when she tells him, “I don’t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.” The reader, even while wondering about some mysterious aspects of Rochester’s behaviour, is likely to approve of Rochester’s appreciation and respect for a woman who speaks her mind.Indeed, Jane’s willingness to express herself, openly and fearlessly, is one of the many inspiring aspects of Jane Eyre. Novelist Brontë must have known that plenty of traditionalist readers across Great Britain, and beyond, would disapprove of protagonist Jane making statements like this one:It is vain to say that human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity; they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it….Women are supposed to be very calm generally; but women feel just as men feel….It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.Nevertheless, she persisted – both novelist Charlotte Brontë, and protagonist Jane Eyre.The existence of a mysterious, haunting presence at Thornfield does much to give Jane Eyre many of its much-remarked-upon Gothic qualities, particularly when Jane saves Rochester’s life after finding him asleep in a room where something, or someone, set the curtains on fire.Jane also gets to see Mrs. Reed one more time – and the reader learns, with Jane, that Mrs. Reed told a lie in order to deny Jane something that would have done Jane good. Helping Jane would have required only the telling of the truth, and would have cost Mrs. Reed nothing; telling the lie haunts Mrs. Reed’s dying hour, and yet her dislike for Jane is so strong and so fixed that she cannot regret what she has done. Mrs. Reed is one of the most malicious characters that I have encountered in literature – and her dog-in-the-manger attitude is only too believable. Is Jane’s forbearance and compassion, in the face of Mrs. Reed’s malice, equally believable? Yes. I have had the good fortune to know a couple of people like Jane Eyre – though not many. Heaven knows, not many.The attraction between Jane and Rochester is strong and apparent. Even when it appears that Rochester may marry a wealthy young woman of his own social station, he confesses to Jane that “I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you – especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame.” The reference to Eve being made from one of Adam’s ribs is subtly and nicely incorporated.For her part, Jane says that she cannot stay in a household where Rochester is to be the bridegroom of another:“Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an automaton? – a machine without feelings? And can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! – I have as much soul as you – and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you.”Another subtle mythological reference – this one to Tantalus’ torments in Hades – is a highlight of this magnificent passage. It is clear that Jane and Rochester are already desperately, hopelessly in love with each other.Rochester proposes to Jane, and for a time this poor girl who has endured so much is deliriously happy – but the intended wedding day is undone in a powerful scene that (a) provides an explanation for the bizarre and Gothic events that have been unfolding at Thornfield Hall, and (b) reveals that Rochester has been hiding a deep, dark secret. Has he ever.Jane leaves Thornfield, and goes out into the world, penniless and alone. Eventually, however, she makes her way to Moor House, where she is taken in by St. John Rivers and his sisters Diana and Mary.St. John is a particularly interesting character. Young and handsome, St. John is loved by a beautiful and kind young woman; but he has rejected the chance for true love and a happy, tranquil marriage, out of his zeal to become a Christian missionary serving in India. Like so many other characters in the novel, St. John describes Jane as plain – “Ill or well, she would always be plain. The grace and harmony of beauty are quite wanting in those features” – and, like Brocklehurst earlier in the book, he provides an illustration of Brontë’s sense that a professed, outward dedication to the Christian religion, if not informed by the ethic of universal love and compassion demonstrated by Jesus of Nazareth, is meaningless. If I have not love, I am nothing.As elsewhere in the novel, Jane wins friends through her humility, her uncomplaining ways, and her willingness to work hard. Hannah, St. John’s servant, had been openly hostile to this homeless girl who just showed up at the door one rainy night – Jane remarks that “Prejudices…are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones” – but even she eventually warms to Jane’s likeable personality.Jane becomes a teacher, and her compassionate belief in empathetic outreach makes her an effective educator for the rural Northern girls who are her pupils. As the term ends with the Christmas holiday, she observes that “I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and strongly. Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated hearts”. And when fortune finally smiles upon Jane, in the shape of a £20,000 legacy, it is no surprise that she insists on sharing the legacy equally with St. John, Diana, and Mary! Jane makes no great matter of this generosity that would be well beyond the moral reach of most people, stating simply that “Good fortune opens the hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the sensations.”Yet St. John wants more from Jane – as the reader senses when he insists that Jane abandon her studies of the German language, and begin studying Hindustani instead – and eventually Jane has to put St. John in his place:“I scorn your idea of love,” I could not help saying, as I rose up and stood before him, leaning my back against the rock. “I scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you offer it.”Indeed, one wishes Jane Eyre had put the arrogant and self-righteous St. John Rivers in his place a couple of dozen pages earlier.One more fateful journey awaits Jane – one that is fraught with still more new and surprising plot developments – and the novel concludes on a resonant and dramatically satisfying note. I will say no more, in order to avoid the prospect of making a “spoiler alert” necessary. Please read for yourself and enjoy.Jane Eyre is a great love story with a courageous and compassionate heroine who inspires now as much as she did in the 1840’s. Indeed, in a time when some advocates of “traditional values” express, ever more vocally, their resentment of women’s advancements in various fields of human endeavour, her example is as compelling, as relevant, and as needed today as it ever was. The story has been well filmed several times, both for cinema and in mini-series format – though I think the 1943 film version, with Joan Fontaine as Jane and Orson Welles as Rochester, takes the proverbial cake for perfect casting. Yet no film, no matter how well-crafted, provides a substitute for reading this great book, accompanying Jane on her long and difficult journey, and rooting for her to find the happiness that she so richly deserves."
268,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115890-constantine,Rating 4 out of 5,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐Genre: ClassicThis was a delightful read, especially for the current season. The story starts by showing the sorrows and misery of Jane’s early life and then her life at Lowood School. Her relationship with Mr. Rochester at first can be called awkward. But then this awkward bond becomes deeper with time and turns into a love story with an age gap of twenty years! Now whether that is convincing or not it will all depend on how you will look at it. Charlotte Bronte’s writing is beautiful. It captures the world, the characters, and the situations brilliantly. The only problem was the pacing but that is something many classics suffer from. I feel the story dragged a bit in the middle. The beginning, the ending, and the major parts of the novel were all solid. The book would have been better with fewer pages in the middle. The atmosphere was excellent though throughout the book. “I do not think, sir, you have any right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.”I wouldn’t go on to say Jane Eyre is my favorite classic. It is a solid one indeed but there are other classics that I prefer over this one. And one example would be Wuthering Heights. I feel where Emily Bronte excels over Charlotte is in maintaining a steady pace with much less dragging in the storytelling. However, both the authors share some big advantages and these are having a well-written story with a fantastic vibe and complex characters. "
269,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16127160-chavelli-sulikowska,Rating 4 out of 5,"I am in love with this book. Then I fell out of love, quite rapidly. It happens. Jane just became too tedious. It is less whimsical than Austen but more accessible than Hardy – perhaps more in line with George Eliot, whom I adore. Jane is such an interesting character to begin with and undoubtedly the most infamous of all the Bronte sister’s heroines. From a young age she demonstrates a resolute inner strength, an emotional hardiness and ability to take life’s hardships in her stride. She has gumption.Everything is a lesson - her experiences both good and bad form her resilience and steady reasoning. What I love most is her intolerance for any injustice – she is fair, level headed and mild tempered, but she never shirks from speaking out against injustice to either herself or others. She is neither highly strung and irrational like Hardy’s Bathsheba, meek and mild like Agnes Grey or tempestuous and silly and shallow like Austen’s Emma. She is described as small and insignificant, plain looking – not our usual breath taking Victorian heroine. No matter how much she is tested, she remains true to herself – stubbornly so and to the point of martyrdom! A tad infuriating this incessant tendency for self flagellation!It was good, I am glad I read it and persisted through the uphill-ness of the last part. But I think I am done with the Brontes for a while. I have realised I prefer Austen, Elliot and Hardy, I will focus my attention there."

I was not expecting to love it anyway near as much as I did but I have been pleasantly surprised!Despite the size of this book I never once felt like it was dragging and that I was bored. The story honestly grips you from the first few pages I simply became hooked until the very end! The huge twists and turns within the story well and truly messed with my emotions but I loved it! The plot is complex and very clever, I adore how it all linked together and the end had me in tears.This book has such a huge range of incredible characters who were all extremely well written, no one character was uninteresting. I personally loved Jane as a character. I love her morals and thoughts about life, they were insightful and encouraging.The romance side to his novel was so tragic yet alluring! I was not disappointed with the outcome I will tell you that...Brontë's writing style is what also makes this book so special. It transports you to other places through the stunning description and imagery. At times I was on the edge of my seat in suspense because the writing had me so invested!I feel like this become has easily become one of my favourites and I doubt I will ever tire of it. If you are put off by this book's size or the fact that it is a classic then PLEASE don't be!! Read it, I promise you will NOT regret it!"

274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110818447-paula-emmerich,Rating 5 out of 5,"Un libro magnífico en todo sentido. 500 páginas de sostenido drama, con aquellos momentos de respiro y reflexión que te permiten continuar con la acción. Jane Eyre son tres historias en una: la trayectoria autobiográfica de la protagonista desde su niñez hasta la edad adulta, una historia de amor imposible y un terrible misterio. Mientras nuestros protagonistas luchan por el amor, detrás de las majestuosas paredes de Thornfield, se cuecen oscuros y tenebrosos secretos. La intriga es además acompañada con observaciones inteligentes acerca de la sociedad, la religión y el alma humana, y una prosa elegante y poética. Los protagonistas emergen de las páginas como si fueran de carne y hueso con sus peculiares formas de hablar y comportarse, sus defectos y virtudes, sus anhelos y sus frustraciones. Cuando otros libros describen paraísos o infiernos terrenales, esta novela nos muestra un balance realista entre la bondad y la maldad humana. Así, una vida de sufrimientos y privaciones en un orfanatorio es compensada con la mano dócil de algún maestro o amigo. Cuando la protagonista debe escoger entre el sacrificio y su interés personal, se debatirá entre la moral y sus ansias por ser feliz. La novela nos presenta un abanico de temas: intelectuales y ordinarios, materiales y espirituales, personales y sociales. Nuestros héroes cuestionarán a la alta sociedad que desprecia la pobreza y la fealdad, desafiarán el lugar que esta les ha asignado y defenderán su amor propio. Se cuestionará el valor de la riqueza y de la belleza; se buscará el amor verdadero, contrastando el amor sensual y el espiritual, y se apreciarán las ocupaciones ordinarias, especialmente el de la búsqueda de la felicidad en la Tierra. El mismo Dios será desafiado y, a la vez, invocado.Esta novela ofrece un viaje extraordinario al interior de la protagonista desde su niñez, en que su inocencia y bondad es revestida de una fiera rebeldía, hasta su maduración en una joven autosuficiente pero apasionada. La acompañaremos en su defensa del amor propio y en sus batallas de independencia intelectual y emocional. La veremos luchar por el amor, porque una vida de sufrimientos no le ha arrancado las ganas de vivir, sino que le ha dado más ansias por encontrar felicidad. Y su búsqueda de pasión no es solo carnal, sino espiritual. Nuestra Jane busca ante todo una familia, porque su sufrimiento esencial es el de la soledad. Su búsqueda: rodearse de gente bondadosa que la amen tal como ella es. Es un libro, en el fondo, acerca de la soledad, uno de los sentimientos más dolorosos del ser humano.Apasionante, intrigante y profunda. ***Nota (Spoiler Alert): Aunque la trama es sólida y te sorprende con giros inesperados, hay un detalle que es mi única crítica a la novela, pero no le quita méritos. El ansia de Jane por encontrar una familia es muy poderosa. Se podría decir que es en realidad su motivación principal y nuestra heroína encuentra unos parientes lejanos, pero los descubre por casualidad y, siendo una pieza tan importante de su trayectoria, no resulta creíble. ***ALGUNAS FRASES Y PÁRRAFOS: (conteniendo mi deseo de transcribirte el libro) Niña, toma este libro. ¿Ves? Se titula Manual del niño bueno, y debes leerlo con interés, sobre todo las páginas que tratan de la espantosa muerte repentina.Se supone generalmente que las mujeres son más tranquilas, pero la realidad es que las mujeres sienten igual que los hombres, que necesitan ejercitar sus facultades y desarrollar sus esfuerzos como sus hermanos masculinos, aunque ellos piensen que deben vivir reducidas a preparar budines… ―Estese aquí, quietecita como una muerta, hasta que yo vuelva.―Nunca he visto ―rugió él, rechinando los dientes― nada a la vez tan frágil y tan indómito.(...) mi amor yacía, angustiado, en mi corazón, como un niño en una cuna fría.Miss Ingram: «Yo opino que una mujer fea es una mácula de la creación, pero un caballero no debe pensar sino en parecer fuerte y valeroso. Su lema debe ser: cazar, esgrimir y luchar».―¿No tiene usted un peine de bolsillo? ―¿Para qué, Jane? ―Para peinarle esas crines revueltas. Cuando se las veo, me da miedo. Yo seré un hada, pero usted es un coco. ―¿Tan feo te parezco, Jane? ―Horroroso.(Tiene) un entrecejo orgulloso, que parece querer decir: ""Yo puedo vivir sola, si el respeto de mí misma y las circunstancias me obligaran a ello"".―¡Madre! ―gritó la niña―. ¡Aquí hay una mujer que quiere el potaje! ―Si es una mendiga, dáselo. El cerdo está harto ―contestó una voz desde dentro.

276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-dave-schaafsma,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Jane, Jane, Jane!!""-Rochester, in Jane Eyre“I would always rather be happy than dignified.” ""I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being, with an independent will; which I now exert to leave you.” In spite of and in part because of its nineteenth-century gothic romantic roots, Jane Eyre remains one of the great novels, principally because it features one of the best characters of all time, a woman that fairly leaps off the page, a feminist for all ages. I am in agreement with Cecily in her fine review that this book is less a book of romance than it is about life, about being yourself and forging your own path, though it is also an examination of the power and complications of love as a kind of literary model for future romance writers, one of the greatest romances of all time. Here’s a taste of that:“I must, then, repeat continually that we are forever sundered - and yet, while I breathe and think, I must love him.”“I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you — especially when you are near to me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame.”“My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?""“Reader: I married him.”But it is not “he married me,” or “we got married” but a free, independent spirit, a woman making a choice, even a socially unpopular one, because she sees they are equals. And she will only accept him when they are equals. But she isn’t only exacting; she also can be warm and forgiving: “’Jane, I never meant to wound you thus. . . Will you ever forgive me?’Reader, I forgave him at the moment and on the spot.”Some of the plot is mired in nineteenth-century melodrama: The cruel aunt at Gatehead who raises the orphan Jane; the Lowood school where Jane and her fellow classmates are starved by the cruelly Calvinist Brocklehurst; the sudden, cruelly dramatic objection to the marriage to Rochester--the madwoman in the attic--the sudden shifts in fortune, including financial fortune, the sudden discoveries of family that Jane just happens to meet as she (again, cruelly) nearly starves in her escape from Thornfield; the surprising reversals, the fires, the blindness (I am working to avoid some specific spoilers here!), being in though some of that also obviously serves to entertain, within the gothic romantic genre. There is a lot of angst, for good or ill. And I loved it.Oh, and that call in the night, “Jane, Jane, Jane,” that supernatural call between souls, I say that works. When two people are in love. . . hey, you sometimes hear them calling in the night even hours away. Don’t you?!Class matters in this book. Money matters. How you are perceived in society depends in part on how much money you have, and so it is fortunate that Jane comes into money (somewhat melodramatically) because without it the decision she makes could make her seem less than equal in some eyes. Both Jane and Rochester are destitute at points, they suffer, but you know, finally, it’s not about the money, either. Yes, you can starve, as a penniless orphan, poverty kills, but being rich is not as important as friendship and love. One (not I!) might think this fails to be a great book because of some of the above details, but the thing that makes it finally great is Jane, Jane, Jane. And the effort she makes to live a rich (reading, teaching, art, nature, great talk, family) and independent and principled life. And that in the nineteenth century she makes such a stand against the Calvinist preacher! Two Calvinist preachers, if you count St. John Rivers, her missionary cousin who proposes to her! As she makes clear, “Conventionality is not morality.” And Jane is so good without being sappy. She resisted, she persisted, she perseveres! Wonderful book.Read twice in one year, once listen to, and now reread for my YA class with a focus on romance."
277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4218875-kwesi,Rating 4 out of 5,"When a group of people posted on their wall in Facebook about the new adaptation of the book starring Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre, I can't stop looking for a copy of the book so that I can read it in advance. Unfortunately, the company or the producer did not release it worldwide and I don't have a choice but to force someone to grab me a copy. Too bad, I got a free movie (pirated) somewhere.Life is too cruel and dark for Jane Eyre, she is a girl with great opinion, pretty and a typical girl who fall in love to a mysterious man. As an orphan she lived with her uncle, aunt and cousins. But because of the death of her uncle, everything changes into different direction. She fall from the pit of cruelty of her aunt and her cousins unforgiving attitude and manners towards her. She went to Lowood School for girls after seeing vision of her uncle struck by the light.8 years of studying and teaching in Lowood, she become a talented girl with great heart and big brain. In the end, she quit her job and work as a governess in Rochester's place. She taught different things that manage to develop Adele's skills, a child and orphaned in early age and sent to Rochester, and become the most cutest and lovable character in the book. Rochester fall in love until a misery comes undone, again, Jane Eyre escaped from the misery of the truth.She went far from Rochester's place and found a new home. But it did not last longer when a letter was sent to her to test her love. Can love save her or another misery lies into the new chapter of her life? Jane Eyre a dark and vivid story of a girl, very deadly and gore in some point, become interesting to the young readers as it has similarities to the popular genres lately.This first narrative novel, disturbed me a lot whether this book is a partial memoir or a true fiction. If you read the introduction of the book, the writer manage to add snippets of Charlotte Brontë's life and had parallel to the story. But I'm not sure with the fact that the books have similarities but a young girl with that kind of experience is a little bit awkward for her generation.Well, she was always opposed to her own generation. Many writers and readers went gaga, when they read her novel and sent her letters that tells about the opposition of the novel and as well as whether the book is written by a female or a male author. If somebody will ask me, if the book is written by a male or female, I'll answer female. Simple, the book practice feminism, tackled her life as a female in her generation and becoming a hypocrite just because of expressing her emotions and so on. This book is too depressing or maybe I'm not used to Gothic novels and I emphasize why Charlotte Brontë have to make her character sad every chapter or event or making her character miserable again and again. I think she had a full dose of some kind of substance that made her depressed while writing it or she was trying to exaggerate the scenes. Over-all I enjoyed this book while reading, I never felt this kind of emotion to a book before by pitying a character in the end. Not quite a fairy tail with a happy ending.


I love this scene where Jane superbly sick and needed a shelter while raining outside. A typical beggar scene and very outstanding in delivering the lines. This scene will be found in the near end of the story, at last, Jane manage to save her last breath.

I read Jane Eyre with my fellow co-bloggers, the wonderful ladies at Novel Notions - Celeste, Emma and Haifa. Out of this, the Novel Notions Classics Club was born. Check out our first post on our thoughts and takeaways from Jane Eyre at our blog.
-----------------------------------------Jane Eyre. One of the most well-lauded classics that I've heard so much of, time and again, and also one which has inspired numerous retellings and even spinoffs.It was only appropriate that my goal of reading more canon classics would bring me to the doorstep of this much-loved tale. I have to say I passed the threshold without harbouring any expectation. Well, except that I hoped that I will enjoy it much more than my last classic read, Middlemarch. That I did was an understatement, for Jane Eyre is now my favourite classic. Firstly, I did not expect the setting to be as gothic as it was, which is always a definite plus for me. Secondly, the story was immensely engaging and enthralling with revelations that stunned and shocked. I think that this Victorian-era story will put some modern tales to shame with its ability to keep the readers on the edge with its twists and turns. Then, there is the writing. Oh my god, the writing! So beautifully lush and impactful, I was completely enamoured with the way Bronte wielded the English language - the way the words are put together at every turn of phrase. I savoured and swirled these phrases around in my mind, like how a sommelier will savour wine in his/her palate before consuming the exquisite creation.Last, but far from the least, are the immensely compelling characters of Jane and Edward Rochester. This novel is a fictional autobiography which was written with such fervent passion and ardour but yet tempered with the barest touch of restraint. I felt blessed that my first taste of this wonderful classic was through the superlative audiobook narration by the phenomenally talented Thandie Newton. Jane utterly lived through her stellar performance. Even her voices for the male characters were excellent. Most notably, Mr Rochester was imbued with a quality of melancholic and stern gruffness which suited his characterisation really well. I struggle with writing reviews for classics simply because it feels intimidating with so much already written about them, and with much more eloquence, of that I'm certain. And as such, I intend to take my leave now and end my somewhat brief review by saying that there isn't a shadow of a doubt that I will be rereading Jane Eyre, time and again. Simply, truly brilliant."

XIX. Obras que perduram até hoje e irão sobreviver à passagem do tempo como marco de uma época – mas também com muita intemporalidade - continuando a inspirar outros autores e a arrebatar leitores.Jane Eyre, é um pré-romântico com uma perninha no gótico. Os ambientes sombrios, agrestes e desolados, comuns a O Monte dos Vendavais da irmã Emily ( grande responsável por hoje andar neste maravilhoso mundo dos livros), e os episódios de mistério a pressentir algo de sobrenatural, são cenários que muito me agradam e para onde me transporto facilmente.Não consigo falar de uma sem aludir às outras. As três começaram a escrever usando, por razões óbvias, pseudónimos masculinos, e os editores chegaram suspeitar tratar-se da mesma pessoa, tais eram as semelhanças dos escritos. As irmãs Brontë, passaram para as suas heroínas muito das suas próprias vivências: as origens humildes, a família religiosa, a passagem pelo pensionato, proporcionaram um manancial de experiências aplicadas nos seus livros.Jane Eyre é a anti-heroina; sem beleza, sem fortuna, sem família, sem futuro.Mas Jane Eyre, é também uma criança que se faz mulher, intensa, rebelde, sem papas na língua, que não se conforma com o que lhe designam nem se deixa vergar à vontade alheia. Verdadeiro exemplo de tenacidade, luta e impõe-se pelos seus valores - talvez demasiado moralistas para os dias de hoje – mas é essa perseverança que faz dela a figura estável e íntegra que nos conquista e nos leva, inevitavelmente, a admirá-la.Para além disso, Jane Eyre, é também uma linda história de amor que nos envolve, acorda o cupido que há em nós e faz-nos torcer por um desenlace satisfatório. Não corresponde aos convencionais finais corderozinha, mas outro iria destoar completamente e macular uma história que, se não é perfeita, anda perto."
280,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2592286-kerry,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've been trying to catch up on my classic reading lately and so began to listen to Jane Eyre. I remembered little of it, though according to my book lists I last read it in 1988, and I know I read it for English in H.S. but I remembered little except for Rochester's plight and I thought it ended when Jane found out--quite by accident as I remembered her as being simple for not figuring things out herself. I wasn't too far off for those are the high plot points with a bunch of build up before and after Jane realizes what the problems really are at Thornfield Hall. What I didn't remember was how many unlikeable characters lived in these pages. I could not find a one I liked. Jane was frequently annoying and gullible, Rochester despicable and manipulative, St John was sanctimonious, Mrs Reed and her bratty kids were just the start of the miserable people that followed Jane. I can appreciate it is a classic and I did try to hear the message I thought it was trying to convey but the more I read I came to realize that I was either too old for the likes of Jane Eyre or it was too old for me. As much as I wanted to believe its moral message, I knew my present day sensibilities were perhaps too jaded to believe in nobility of Jane's values, her idea of stating her mind--which she seemed to loose most frequently when in the shadow of a man and how being moral and fighting for what you want will bring a happy ever after--a little too fairy tale for me. So about 3.5 stars rounded up. I had a great color illustrated edition-- Rainbow Classics printed in 1946 that I read and listened on walks to Juliet Stevenson. I did love the Introduction in the volume, a short one by May Lamberton Becker which gave background on the Bronte sisters. It did help me to understand their family and need to write. Having loved Anne Bronte's Wildfell Hall I think I will try another of her's for my next Bronte classic."

Rozwój z niedokochanej, kruchej, inteligentnie smutnej dziewczynki w twardą, samowystarczalną i rozumną kobietę był niezwykle inspirujący. Jej postać jest symbolem siły - ale nie tej brutalnej i bezkompromisowej, tylko stanowczej i błyskotliwej. Bardzo długo zastanawiałam się nad tą siłą, nad z początku niezrozumiałymi decyzjami, które podejmowała Jane, nad jej niewysłuchanymi emocjami. Jednak po skończeniu tej powieści wszystkie wątpliwości ustały. Bo ta książka jest właśnie o wątpliwościach, o własnych wewnętrznych rozterkach. O walce. I o drodze. Drodze do wolności, samomiłości, indywidualności. Drodze, po której przejściu czeka na nas człowiek. Tak samo niepełny jak my. Łączy go z nami pewna mistyczna więź, która na zawsze wypełnia naszą duszę wszechogarniającym szeptem uczucia.Piękna, sugestywna powieść z fantastycznym gotyckim klimatem."

286,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19590155-vanessa-j,Rating 5 out of 5,"Edit (August 4, 2015): I'm upping my rating to 5 and adding this to my all-time favourites. It took me a while to realise this, but it's better late than never. This book is so important and feminist and it really should be read by everyone. Jane Eyre is now a role model for me. I can't believe I couldn't see this before....I am really glad I finally read Jane Eyre. I found about it last year when I was looking for the best gothic books of all time. Wuthering Heights was the first I came up with. I read it and I utterly loved it. Afterwards, an interest for the author was born. I learned she had sisters and that they were writers too. Immediately, I searched what books they had written. I added many of them to my TBR.It was not until somewhere in May that I remembered about the existence of Jane Eyre. I started it without a moment's delay. It took me long to finish it, but it was not because it was bad, merely because I had no time to read. Now, I've got you should read this if you haven't.Jane Eyre is not only a romance. It's the story of a girl trying to be herself when others want her other things to do. It's the story of an orphan treated badly by everyone around her. It's a story of overcoming obstacles. It's a story about growth.The protagonist, Jane, is great. She is honest and independent. Even when others criticize her and tell her how to be, she is still herself. She does not let others influence her choices. She is intelligent and sometimes sarcastic. She is constantly saying things like this:
""I am my own mistress.""
What's not to love in a character like that?The plot might not have been of my enjoyment. However, this book contains some feminist remarks that were impossible to ignore, and that made me love this book even more.Mr. Rochester is the “love interest.” At first, he didn't like Jane. He talked to her like almost everyone did, or he ignored her completely. It was later after that he started developing feelings for her. I admit I didn't like him. He was so arrogant. He loved listening to himself talk.I could not understand why Jane would fall for a man like him, but then, who am I to judge? Aren't nowadays heroines in books falling in love with abusive jerks?Their relationship, at first, felt fake for me, but the more I read, the more I liked them. He was sarcastic to Jane, but she responded him with more sarcastic remarks. She was the one in command in that relationship. As I said, she was an independent woman.
""I don’t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.""
The writing was good as well. It's not too dense and it's actually really easy to follow the story. There are no awkward metaphors and whenever something is easily misunderstood, Jane explains what was intended to be said. Sure, you can see some elements from the writing style of the time in which it was written, but compared to many books, this was light.If you're doubting whether to give it a try or not, I would say go ahead and read it. If you're not really into classics, I would say, again, read it. You can get some important messages out of this. And if you believe this book requires too much of your attention, then I suggest you read this and something fast-paced. In the end, I would say read it to all cases.Now, I must read something by Anne Brontë. Which one should it be? I don't know yet, but it's certain I will continue reading books by the Brontë sisters. I understand now why many people love them."

From your tender, youthful, lonesome years you spoke to me (I am your confidant - I am 'reader'), and I only wish my sympathies and care could reach you then, when those that sheltered with you tormented and neglected you, young delicate flower. You Jane, you showed me even then, so few your years yet were, that though delicate in appearance, a resilience lived within you and a quiet strength that was at odds with your physicality. You, young Jane, took me along with you to Lowood, to be met with more trials yet, but also with friendship and opportunity to put your vibrant mind and ardent spirit to work. Plain as you may appear, you endeavored to make something of yourself and be honorable and true in doing so. Unalterable were you once a course was decided, you marched forward when time it was to move and just so you found yourself in a proper situation at Thornfield. Twas a mysterious place, but it and it's inhabitant certainly held charms, for you and I who lived vicariously through you. I shall not go into too much detail, but just to say I longed for your happiness and dreaded the ominous uncertainties that you managed to lose sight of for a moment in time, so great were prospects of pleasantness. When dreaded events did come to pass however you did not disappoint, I can not say that I hoped you would do as you did, but I was glad of it - you were still yet stronger and more forthright than I any might have expected. Through the end of your tale you proved the master of your situation by being the master of yourself, how hard that is for most, but your resolution proved indomitable time and again. Oh Jane, you seem too good for this world. From what I have written here one might think you all piousness and lacking in gumption, in vivacity, in passion, but I dare say those very characteristics are what I, 'reader', loved the most in you. I almost wish to say were it not that your heart belonged to another so completely, but if it did not could 'reader' delight in you so? Doubtful. Ahh... I shall endeavor to follow your strong example and be glad to be a confidant to you over again I dare say - to have my attentions drawn by the utterance of 'reader' from young Jane Eyre to me again. I shall try to stay true to myself in hard times, that is the lesson I shall take from you, petite & plain Jane.Thank you,With most ardent esteem,(this) Reader Okay, so I should probably discuss Charlotte Bronte's writing, but need more be said when I just waxed on about her creation? Perhaps I should comment on societal moors and Christianity's role in this book, but you can find that elsewhere. I will also admit I barely hinted at much of the plot, much less any of the other well constructed characters, go read the book, there is no way I could ever do it justice. Today I choose to simply send my love to this strong character and her creator both - my thanks for sharing with me ladies, until again we meet. "

I had rather be a thing than an angel.""*Nora Helmer claps in the distance*I won't review a timeless classic because I can't do such a thing. I'll just say that the reason why I think this book is so awesome is because this is pretty much a coming of age story, we follow Jane's steps ever since she's a little child, she walks us through the best and the worst of her life, she allows us to get to know her up until her adulthood; we see her going through seemingly insurmountable tribulations and, via trial and error, we see her growing up to then become the closest version of herself that she aspired to be all her life.

This novel is intensely emotional, very well thought-out and structured, unputdownable, full of literary allusions, Romanticism, folklore, mysticism, and wit - what's there not to like?

She does all the right things, but she's never prim or boring. Her personality makes us really care what'll happen to her, what she'll do next, and this makes the novel a real page-turner. And a well-written one at that, with lots of layers and depth to the story. I loved how much was conveyed via dreams, scenery, even interiors. (Also, there's a dog and nothing bad happens to him, which is a great relief ;)).Before this re-read, the last time I'd read this book had been many years ago; and yet, I realized, I remembered most of the story vividly (which is to say, it really is gripping, isn't it?). But this time, I could google lots of things, like the History of British Birds (the book Jane's reading behind the curtain), for instance - I'd never realized how queer those illustrations really were:https://play.google.com/store/books/d...And Google does help with the many allusions to biblical stories, probably the one thing about this book I didn't enjoy that much.I actually think I'm looking forward to the next re-read :)"

And I'm so glad I did! I should add that I alternated between the Brilliance Audio Unabridged Audiobook and a Wordsworth edition paperback.The previous time I read the book, I was all of 13 or 14 years old and the part of the book that I found most engaging was that set at Lowood (I was at boarding school myself at the time, and while I can't pretend the conditions rivalled those that Jane experienced, I felt miserable much of the time). Without a particularly wide understanding of 19th century social norms, I found Jane's relationship with Rochester somewhat perplexing, saddled with the black and white views of an adolescent as I was. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the story and Jane's ultimate attainment of the happiness she deserved.This time around, some 30 years later, I really appreciated the subtleties of Bronte's writing, her narrative and character arcs and her skillful use of place and atmosphere. This is an amazing book."

I have as much soul as you, and full as much heart!"" Well, this was a beautiful journey.If you know me, you should know that 1) I am usually very harsh when it comes to rating classic novels, and 2) I tend to not care for the frivolities of British literature. And I am thankful to say, Jane Eyre managed to grab me by the shoulders and make me look past my previous hesitancy towards classic British novels, resolving everything I so very much disliked before. Though not a perfect novel, Jane Eyre acutely represents the hardships of a plain and poor young woman when met with the adventures that life may pose her to risk in order to achieve. Jane Eyre was destined for difficulty since she was born, a penniless orphan with naught but a name. She spent the first ten years of her life living with her cruel aunt and cousins, and the next eight at a boarding school for girls called Lowood. From there, she finds employment at Thornfield Hall, under the supervision of one Mr. Edward Rochester. As I'm sure you can guess, this blossoms a bit of a romance. Although the romance in this book was not my favorite thing, I admired how Jane was able to deal with her relationships directly. Her character is someone I strive to be- modest, apt, clever, and most of all, composed. I liked that Jane wasn't considered beautiful, either. There are some books where I'm like, ""We get it, we get it, she's SO beautiful,"" but this was not the case. Jane is described as plain most of the time, but her kind heart and moving spirit are what leads readers to commend her decisions as the plot thickens. I loved her relationships with the people around her, including Adele, Ms. Fairfax, the servants, and the people she meets along the way.This book was also more funny than I had been expecting. With most classic novels, it's all seriousness and lengthy description- and though this made up a significant part of the story, Jane and Rochester's banter with each other was something I lived for. ""You examine me, Miss Eyre,"" said he. ""Do you think me handsome?""I should have deliberated, have replied to this question by something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I was aware: ""No, sir.”Sure, in the book Mr. Rochester is described several times as ""ugly, surly, stern, and sardonic,"" but when you cast Michael Fassbender to play him, I doubt you could tell him he's ugly to his face. It would be like: R: Do you find me handsome?J: Nope.*lie detector explodes*I thought the plot twist and the entire resolution as the pieces were put together was really interesting. I was very satisfied by the ending and with Jane's choices. But let's just ignore St. John for now. Jane Eyre has led me to think differently about how I view literature, and I think I will definitely pick up more novels like it in the future!"
299,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1790086-alisha,Rating 5 out of 5,"Victober 2023 reread: I love Charlotte Bronte's writing as much as ever, and Jane Eyre is always a delight to read, though it's interesting to compare one's feelings about it at different stages of life. ☺️ This time around, I had much less patience for Rochester-- I harangued at him to leave Jane alone at various points, especially when he's playing games early on in their relationship. But that doesn't take away from the beautifully satisfying place that Jane finds herself in by the end of the novel, where she finally has full agency over her own life AND the deep contentment of living with someone that enjoys her company so completely that she need never filter her own personality. It's idealistic, and the road to get there may be full of toxicity, but boy is it a great story and a perfectly satisfying ending.----------------------------------------Previous review:This book is what began my lifelong affinity for British literature. I was 11. I was staying the night at my friend Natasha's house, and her mom had introduced this mother-daughter bedtime reading aloud thing, and they were just a few chapters into Jane Eyre. I listened. I think it was one of the chapters where Jane hangs out with Helen in the super-depressing boarding school. Don't ask me what it was that caught me, because those are NOT the thrilling bits, but caught I was. I suspect it was the language, richer and older than anything else I'd read, but still understandable (with a modicum of mental application), and deeply satisfying once the brain illuminated the jump from words to meaning.Next thing I knew, I was buying a copy of Jane Eyre at a book fair and devouring it. I lost that copy one morning in middle school. I mourned. (I still feel sad.) I bought a new edition. Next year, when I was 12, I was struck by the idea that where there was ONE incredible book, there must be more. Cue the search for 19th century books written by women. Enter Jane Austen, etc., etc.. The rest is history.Rereading Jane Eyre, a story well known and loved by me, was a thrill, but with the fun this time around of accumulating new opinions and evaluations that I didn't think about when I was younger. Though Charlotte Bronte never invests her heroines with any need to grow or change--they spring from her pen fully formed and unapologetically deliberate in all their actions--this story still has a tremendous amount of heart. And also there's all that romantic suspense--UNBEATABLE!"
300,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54721988-ha-fa,Rating 5 out of 5,"What a delightful re-read! I had the pleasure to buddy read Jane Eyre with my friends and co-bloggers Celeste, Emma and TS and I enjoyed the heck out of it (both the book and the discussions that ensued)! Sadly Jane and her friends' eloquence didn't rub off me and I don't believe I have much to add to what has already been said over the centuries anyway. I will therefore try to keep this short. I read this book multiple times when I was a kid. And while I liked it well enough and though I still remembered most of the plot, I'm sure I never stopped to ponder over the multitude of themes (religion, free will, emancipation, bullying...), Charlotte Brontë discussed in her atmospheric, avant-garde and surprisingly feminist masterpiece. This time around, and thanks to the lovely ladies I mentioned above, Jane Eyre elicited an intellectual effort, as well as a strong emotional response from me. The writing was exquisite (although, a tad too descriptive for my taste). Jane and Mr. Rochester felt vivid and real in their contradictions, volatility and passions. Other characters on the contrary, fascinated me with their unflappability and with their unshakable convictions or prejudice. The plot, though a bit slow at places, was extremely well woven and full of mystery and twists and unforeseen revelations.Charlotte Brontë , as well as Thandie Newton's impeccable narration and mesmerizing voice took me back to Northern England, right in the middle of the 19th century. I experienced Jane's solitude and sense of injustice in Gateshead, understood her rebellious and determined attitude in Lowood, felt her woe and passions in Thornfield Hall. I shared her thoughts and doubts and beliefs and barely tamed feelings. Finishing the book left me with a bittersweet feeling. Sweet because I felt a deep satisfaction at the closure Brontë gave her characters. Bitter, because I had to draw a line under it and I wasn't -I am still not- ready to say goodbye. Rating: 4.5 stars"

Cute little hardback...I am putting my re-read of this classic on hold for now, I am not in the mood for it. Might pick it up again at a later date (April/May 2018).********Original review from 2008: (pretty sure I read it before, but I could be delusional)I expected to be bored. Classics usually do that to me. Especially, when I know the story already quite well. But this I liked quite a lot. I did a little skimming in the beginning and occasionally throughout the book, when it got a little too slow for my taste. Jane feels relatively modern and the language, although necessarily old-fashioned, wasn't too stilted. I could have done without the episode with St John. That part of the book felt like a filler to me and I don't remember seeing it in any of the various TV adaptations I have watched over the years.I was sobbing through the last chapter and bought the book for my mum as well. Can't wait to hear how she liked it.Cover art is not correct."

I dare say if Jane Austen wrote these same characters, the novel would end around the 60% mark. The remaining 40% was quite unexpected. While I would likely have loved this even more without the weird twist, I do understand why this was important for the two main characters and for the story itself.Jane Eyre is simply wonderful. She's basically my role model--she's intelligent, sensible, and she seeks kindred spirits instead of attractiveness in others. As for M. Rochester, he's something else. Not quite a pretty boy and not much of a gentleman, either. But very introspective and intelligent in his own weird way. He really had to make his confession this theatrical!Something must be said about the gorgeous writing. It was like a... well... dream, for lack of better description. Lyrical and just ethereal. If only people still spoke this way!Anyway, now I'm off to re-read Chapter 23!"

Es un libro poderoso, nada romántico: aquí se nos presentan la mediocridad, la crueldad, el egoísmo y la ignominia de manera clara y sin titubeos. Pero también la esperanza, la resiliencia y la fuerza de carácter. Atentos a Jane, un personaje mayúsculo en la historia universal. Referente, no solo dentro del feminismo, sino a nivel general. ¿Por qué no podríamos equipararla a homólogos masculinos tan complejos y llenos de entuertos mentales como Henry Fleming o Werther o Hamlet? Para mí, lo mejor de Jane es que es consciente de quien es, se acepta y se entiende, pero no por ello deja de soñar, pues ¿quién ha dicho que las chicas de aspecto insípido no puedan picar más alto? Se queda en una obra de ficción, en fin... pero es un testimonio, una quimera, un atisbo del mundo que podría ser y nunca fue. Cortesía de la Charlotte, a quien imagino, no sé, como un trasunto de Jane, haciendo realidad otra vida, aunque solo fuese en papel."

It is very slow at first and you have to read about 150 pages to really get into the story. But once you get to Rochester...it is so beautiful. I love the romance between him and Jane, and their dialogues were the best. It is full of descriptions and that is the only thing that tells you that it’s not a 21th century novel. Even though it's a classic, i feel that Charlotte way of writing is easy to read and kinda modern."

310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,Rating 5 out of 5,"What better way to escape thoughts of the twin pandemics of a worldwide corona-virus & racial inequality in America than to reread a romantic classic novel, set in West Yorkshire during 1st half of the 19th century. However, with 40,000 reviews of Jane Eyre already listed, how to fashion such a review so that it will in some way look at the book from a different angle. For starters, I have long been fascinated by the Brontë family & especially the brief lives of the sisters in their remote cloister within the Haworth parsonage where their father served as minister. The 3 sisters, Charlotte, Emily & Anne + their brother Branwell all existed within a very confined social as well as physical space but fueled each other's imaginations, with Charlotte & Branwell creating an imaginary world called Angria and sisters Emily & Anne devising a similar mythical sphere called Gondal, both offshoots of their originally shared Glass Town. They were all together for 6 very formative years & it was said that ""lacking playmates, they learned to wish for none."" Instead, they roamed the moors, cherished pets & thrived on the company of each other, before the Brontë quartet splintered, the sisters going off to a nearby school or becoming a governess, with Branwell working as an apprentice & then for a local railway.What I find enduringly charming about Jane Eyre is that Jane's relationship with Rochester, rather than being a case of opposites attracting, seems to me one of a special personal congruence, with minds, emotions & wills that are different ultimately complementing rather than contradicting each other.Jane is born of moderate circumstances but is excluded from a share of any family fortune when her mother marries a poor curate, who then dies of typhus. Jane is sensitive to what she has missed in life but always alert to the possibilities, strong of spirit & exceedingly resilient but never arrogant or petulant. Having survived a rather difficult time as a student at the Lowood School for 6 years under the harsh & dogmatic Mr. Brocklehurst, who is said to be ""made up of equal parts of iron & whalebone"", Jane then becomes a teacher at Lowood School for a further 2 years. Tiring of the school, Jane becomes a governess at an estate called Thornwood, in the employ of Edward Fairfax Rochester, 20 years her senior, a man who enjoys testing Jane but who seems immediately attracted to her obviously different temperament. Here is just a sample of Mr. Rochester's personality at play:I asked you a question. Are you dumb, Miss Eyre, stubborn? The fact is that once & for all, I don't wish to treat you as an inferior but claim only such superiority as must result from 20 years' difference in age & a century's advance in experience. Not 3 in 3,000 raw school-girl-governesses would have responded to me as you do. But I don't mean to flatter you, for if you are cast in a different mold than the majority, it is no merit of yours. Nature did it. But perhaps I go too fast in my conclusions, for you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to counter-balance your few good points.There is a sort of pleasant verbal jousting between Jane & Mr. Rochester that I find wonderful. Here is another exchange, this one from Jane, just after Rochester comments, ""You are afraid of me, because I talk like a sphinx?""Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am certainly not afraid. To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the conversation, because it has got me out of my depth. Only one thing I know: you said that you were not as good as you should like to be, and that you regretted your own imperfection. It seems to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to become what you yourself approve of, behavior you might revert to with pleasure.While Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre lacks the almost baroque complexity of her sister Emily's Wuthering Heights, it is story of considerable transformation on the part of the two main characters, with Jane frequently stating a moral position to Rochester, as when she declares, ""I like to serve you sir, to obey you in all that is right."" And later, Jane indicates that, ""I am no angel & I will not be one until I die: I will be myself Mr. Rochester & there is nothing celestial about me."" This is at a point when the two have become betrothed but as you already know, there is alas an impediment preventing their marriage. Once again Miss Jane has her faith shaken & flees into the night in spite of Mr. Rochester's pleas for sympathy & understanding at the considerable barrier preventing their wedding. Wandering & destitute, Jane is brought back to health by the Rev. St. John Rivers, who after a time wants to marry Jane, taking her as his faithful helpmate & devoted wife when he sails off to India as a missionary, thus compromising her sense of independence. Ever loyal to her own spirit & keen to determine her own fate, Jane refuses this offer, becoming once again a free agent. For Jane's sense of spirituality is much more inner-directed than bible dependent. Her God is far different than that of the Rev. Rivers, causing Jane to bolt, to lock herself away, fall on her knees & to...pray in my own way--a different way than that of St. John Rivers but effective in its own fashion. I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His feet. I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down, unscared, enlightened--eager for the daylight.Some may consider the ending a wee bit melodramatic & I choose not to spoil it for those few who are not already in Charlotte Brontë's thrall but I am forever captive to the novel's conclusion. What enchants in Jane Eyre is the use of language and the development of the very memorable main characters. At least for me, Jane Eyre, 170 years after first being published under the pseudonym, Currer Bell, seems a romantic tale like no other. In addition to reading Charlotte Brontë's best-known novel, I've managed to attend the operatic rendering of it in St. Louis, composed by Michael Berkeley, to see a theatrical version of the Bronte novel at a small, local theater & also to be present for a wonderful performance of Jane Eyre by the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago. There are countless film versions as well. And at the risk of being tagged as a Brontë ""groupie"", I do recommend a visit to the Bronte Museum at Haworth in West Yorkshire, a quaint English town where the spirit of the 3 authors seems very much alive within the parsonage & in the midst of the surrounding, very atmospheric moors. *The initial image within my review is a sketch of Charlotte Brontë, while the 2nd is of the interior of the Brontë Parsonage at Haworth & the final image of the cemetery where 2 of the 3 sisters (Charlotte & Emily) are buried, looking up toward the parsonage, the site that spawned so many memorable novels. **For those who may be interested, there is a very helpful, well-illustrated book by Phyllis Bentley, The Brontës, part of the Thames & Hudson Literary Lives series, into which I've tucked a map of Haworth + a Royal Mail booklet of postage stamps featuring the images of Currer (Charlotte), Ellis (Emily) & Acton (Anne) Bell, i.e. the Brontë sisters."

Goodness.This book has touched my soul.Words cannot do my feelings justice, but I will try LOLOkay, so first I want to say that starting this book I knew what was going to happen at the end and everything because I watched the movie from 2011. I also had an idea of the book because my sister and mother read and love it. And it's my sister's favorite movie too haha.Alrighty, to compare to the movie, there are a few things I want to say...First, Diana and Mary Rivers are not ANYTHING like they are in the book. There was a lot more they could've done with those characters in the movie. It makes me sad just because I really liked them. One thing I thought was smart, was completely cutting out the character Rosamond Oliver from the movie, to me, she was an extra side character and not important to the story whatsoever. Granted, her involvement with St. John Rivers added some more insight into his character.Jane and Rochester were SPOT ON (in my little opinion). Adele and Mrs Fairfax as well.Now to get to the book. It was a lot more religious than I was expecting, which of course I have absolutely no problem with, being a Roman Catholic. I mean, of course it was Protestant leaning, but that didn't bother me so much. But anyways...Sad parts made me cry, happy parts made me grin from ear to ear, romantic scenes made me squeal with joy, and embarrassing parts made me turn off my Kindle and take a break. Omg ROCHESTERRRRRRRRR Okay so I know there are many people who never forgave him, think he's ugly and mistreats people bla bla bla. I'm not going to say he didn't make mistakes, but Jane forgave him! And I FORGAVE HIM, and also he do be kinda fine not gonna lie....Or is that just because he's Michael Fassbender in the movie...? Nope, I think it's just because I love him so much.Jane. I love, respect, and relate to Jane so much. And honestly, Jane makes mistakes too. Everybody makes mistakes. Maybe that's why we relate so hard with her, because she's just so REAL.I don't want to spoil, but that scene at the end, just made me SO HAPPYYY I know I just read this, but Jane Eyre might just be my favorite book of all time.

I appreciated this book even more, besides seeing 2 different versions of the movie - the new version and the one with Orson Welles - but because I have the songbook/CD to the Musical!!!! I've always loved the music, but I didn't really read the story until I decided to really read what what going on in the musical, and when I did....I LOOOOOOOVED it and was fascinated by it!!! especially with the Character. Just amazing. So, I watched 2 movies, and realized I had yet to read the book and I loved it because there were lines/phrases taken from the book to the musical, and when I noticed similar lines/phrases I wanted so badly to sing and the song that went with a part would pop into my head and when I was done listening to a disc or a chapter, I'd sometimes put the musical CD in and go to the song and sing along!!! But charlotte Bronte was a genius!!! I don't read much classics, but THIS is one I'd have to say that THIS is what should be read in school!!!! I just fell in love with Jane, Rochester, Adele, Mrs. Fairfax...the whole gang!!! It's a memorable story and Couple (Jane and Rochester). But wow.....I can see why a TON of people love this story!!!! Long, but totally worth it!!!!! And if you get a chance, go on Amazon and just buy Jane Eyre the musical cd. The music is gorgeous, even a song when Rochester is singing about how he fell in love with Adele's mother (song: as good as you) is absolutely beautiful, and oh my gosh just freaking get it.

Jane Eyre is my fave.Okay, some thoughts: I'm really glad I had the Penguin Cloth-bound edition because 1. it's gorgeous, and 2. it has a GREAT appendix. Bronte includes so many allusions that 80% of them would have gone over my head without the endnotes. I found those extremely helpful for both historical context (there's the occasional archaic word) and literary context.I really enjoyed having quite a bit of French at the beginning--this was unexpected, but a fun way to practice! It's been a while since I've read anything in French...Jane Eyre, as a character, is amazing. She's willful, strong, and independent even in the face of those that would oppress her. I love that she grapples with instances where she wants to give in, where she realizes how easy it would be to bow to a character's will, and yet she resists. I loved watching her grow over the course of this book.As for her suitors--Rochester and later, Rivers--I really didn't like either of them. BOTH of them were assholes. However, they did make for compelling characters. Characters don't necessarily need to be good (in the moral sense) or likable for them to be compelling, and that's what Bronte does here.I was really happy with the end, though not really for any romantic reasons. I just want Jane to be happy!!!!!! Because she's the best and deserves the world."
314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100763-hadrian,Rating 4 out of 5,"Reread.Jane Eyre is an endearing protagonist and it is very easy to root for her. The immediate and distinct narrative voice helps a lot with that. Given the circumstances of her times, and the uncharitable world for someone of her status and position - she has made perhaps the best decision she could for herself. The status of a woman without money or limited marriage prospects in such a constricting society as that is not good, there is a bit of social realism in this novel thought it draws from the gothic tradition.Personally I am less and less sympathetic for the brooding Byronic hero. While Mr. Rochester is grating and overawing a presence, I find myself thinking more and more about Bertha Mason in the attic. 'It is cruel - she cannot help being mad.', Jane says. Is that all there is for her? I was so troubled that I went ahead and ordered Wide Sargasso Sea from the library."

La devoción por un amor debe venir sólo después de descubrirnos y satisfacer nuestras propias necesidades.Lloré en los últimos capítulos porque siempre he creído que el amor debe de tener como principio el servicio pero no aquel donde alguien sea un sirviente sino un servicio dado desde el corazón y del amor para recibirlo de la misma manera.Sin duda voy a extrañar mucho esta lectura porque trae consigo mensajes que pueden aplicarse a la vida diaria, si tuviera la oportunidad de vivir por un día la vida de estos personajes literarios elegiría a Jane Eyre. Muy recomendado."

319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee-klein,Rating 5 out of 5,"Comely, upstanding prose. Its clarity next to godliness, exemplary moral integrity. Oh, there will be spoilers ahead, so many spoilers, if you're considering reading this and know nothing about it, same way I knew nothing about it, somehow -- avoid all reviews and anything about Charlotte Bronte or else key plot points will be spoiled. I learned Mr. Rochester would become an item the day before he so wonderfully appeared and fell from his horse. Before I read the related pages, I learned that this is the book responsible for ""the madwoman in the attic"" I had read an excerpt of in college. But otherwise I shaded my eyes from reviews like these that have no choice really but to reveal some serious plot points. And unlike when reading 20th century lit, modernist or postmodern, the revelation of what happens really would make a difference to a reading experience. The storytelling is so wonderfully compelling, patient, conventional, especially the meting out of the mystery of the lunatic Creole Bertha in the attic, but also bits like when Mr. Rochester impersonates a traveling soothsaying gypsy or the revelation of the deal post-intervention at the altar. A lot happens in this, and if taken out of context, if removed from the world of the novel and its sensibility, not considered as a construction of these comely and upstanding phrases, most of it is pretty far-fetched, fictional, wishfullfillmental if not quite feelgoodish, and most certainly superproblematic from a contemporary perspective: the 39 to 19 age difference between Mr. Rochester and Jane, Mr. Rochester's illegitimate child he cares for as guardian only and otherwise delegates to governesses, the madwoman in the attic from the West Indies of course, and St. John's great white crusade to bring the Hindus to Christ (not to mention proposing to his cousin who he considers a sister). But all of this was also problematic from Jane's perspective, too, and from Charlotte's perspective were surely all presented as an exaggerated moral obstacle course for Jane to run and come out the winner thanks to unwavering committed virtue, including her early-feminist sense of independence and self-assurance in her equality with men (more so: men are not granted superiority by nature; they must prove themselves her equal). But really I just found the novel enjoyable, comfortable, appreciating the clarifying attention to secondary/tertiary characters (eg, Blanche Ingram or Mr. Mason or the wealthy Mr. Oliver and his beautiful daughter Rosamund, even Pilot the dog -- unlike in, say, her sister Emily's novel, wherein really only Heathcliff seemed indisputably defined and even the primary Catherine was diluted with a secondary Cathy), the consistent stability of its narrative orientation, a lofting comforter of a story I suspected would turn out well in the end, functioning almost like a comedy with the main character beginning low and ending high, albeit scarred and wizened by the experience. Jane, as a narrator, with her famous occasional direct address to the reader (""reader, I married him"" I knew as a famous line in a novel but never knew it came from this one or who ""him"" was), is beyond reliable -- she's a representative of moral responsibility, identifying the old verities and virtues as they arise in drama. Her argumentation is always so righteous and always on the side of right, in a way I rooted for -- the underdog who rises up. The whole novel reminded me of Louis CK's bit about Good Will Hunting, sort of, how Matt Damon wrote and directed it and starred in it and made his character a handsome super-genius who gets to make out with Minny Driver. In this, Charlotte Bronte seems to run her narrator through a similar sort of wish-fulfillment gauntlet, the orphan with an innate moral sense, judge of all around her, weighing per an understanding of Scripture and always acting according to her calculations, receiving for good behavior a massive inheritance from a distant relation also related to the family who saved her toward the beginning of the third section. Even the naughty narrative obstacle of the first wife is cleaned up neatly by the fire and Bertha leaping to her death from the roof. Voila! Looking forward to read Wide Sargasso Sea at one point -- and some of the essays in the back of a critical edition I acquired at a library book sale this fall. Would've loved to have read this in college with a great professor but maybe I wasn't ready for it at that time in my life? I read on an iPad, white text on black screen, often in the dim light of a Christmas tree up way too early, strung with red lights, moving the little red bookmark string to chart my progress on the comely, upstanding Penguin Classics hardcover I laid out on a table but didn't actually read. Will probably read Villette next and then maybe some of Gaskell's biography of Charlotte Bronte."

Novela leída por tercera vez en el Kobo en la edición de Penguin Clásicos de Toni Hill, la segunda mejor traducción al castellano de la obra de Charlotte Brontë.------------------------------------------------Reseña de la segunda lectura.Cuando acabé Ancho Mar de los Sargazos sentí un violento impulso de releer Jane Eyre. Como fue una decisión espontanea me lancé a ello con la vieja traducción con la que me adentré en esta novela por primera vez. Pero esta es, seguramente, una de las más nefastas traducciones que se han hecho de Jane Eyre. Cuando lo relea por tercera vez quiero hacerlo con la traducción de Carmen Martín Gaite en esa edición tan mona de Alba Minus. ¡Prometido! Pero ni siquiera algo tan determinante como una traducción ha podido eclipsar la magnificencia de Jane Eyre.¿Cuántas cosas se han dicho de este libro? ¡Ay, cuántas! Hablaré tan solo de mis impresiones. Cuando lo leí por primera vez en 2015 sentí que era una buena novela, pero nada más allá. Recuerdo que le di cuatro estrellas precisamente por eso; me había gustado, pero no me había encantado. La erosión del mar sobre mis escollos ha revelado que a lo largo de estos años el agua salada ha moldeado opiniones distintas sobre Jane Eyre. A veces, necesitamos alejarnos de un libro para saber que su influencia es determinante en nuestras vidas. A lo largo de estos cuatro años he pensado mucho en el libro, ¡y cuán acogedora y reveladora ha sido esta obra para mí! Hasta que llegó Christina Rossetti a mi vida cuando pensaba en la época victoriana, automáticamente imaginaba una escena cualquiera de Jane Eyre. Sí, he amado Jane Eyre con todo mi corazón, pero también he odiado Jane Eyre con todo mi corazón. He detestado esa insana devoción que me ha creado por una época que me habría rechazado más abiertamente y con más virulencia que la presente. Pero cuando harta de tanto dolor pretendía destruir ese vínculo entre esta obra, la época victoriana y yo me daba cuenta de que eso jamás sería posible. Pertenezco de alguna extraña forma a esa época pasada, como un pedazo de alma pertenece a este libro. Así he mantenido esta relación, cuanto menos tempestuosa, con Jane Eyre. Ahora que he releído Jane Eyre he comprendido totalmente el sentido de estos sentimientos que me han acompañado casi un lustro. Hasta el más pequeño detalle de la obra me ha marcado. Sus atmósferas, los caracteres de los personajes y su manera de afrontar las decisiones, su humor, su estética, su fealdad…Una escena 	que bien podría resumir todo lo que siento es cuando Jane vuelve a Thornfield tras el entierro de su tía. La escena trascurre en la cocina de Thornfield. La señora Fairfax, Jane y Adele están sentadas junto al fuego, y el señor Rochester está en la mesa. Jane todavía no sabe que Rochester la ama, ni él sabe si ella lo quiere tanto como para no huir de la casa cuando le revele su pérfido secreto. ¡Hay tantas emociones contenidas en esa escena que, sin embargo, me transmite una paz absoluta! Una escena breve que se desarrolla en un marco común, humilde y sencillo. Casi podríamos calificarlo como “vulgar”, en su más positiva acepción, pues la escena se desarrolla en una cocina oscura, en vez de en un marmóreo saloncito. ¿Por qué? Bueno, la pregunta más bien es: ¿A caso esa escena podría transmitirnos algo en un marco que no fuera en las penumbras de la cocina de Thornfield? Sé el libro ha sido muy discutido por ciertas ideas que plantea. Claramente en una obra que tiene ciento setenta y dos años es imposible que no aparezcan ideas que entren en conflicto con los ideales de la actualidad. A mí, en general, me da igual que un clásico sea problemático. Yo soy problemática. Y de corazón te lo digo que si tan importante crees que un clásico sea machista o racista te recomiendo que no leas clásicos y te centres en otra clase de littérature acorde a tus elevados ideales junto con esa magnífica y absoluta visión del mundo que ofrecen las literaturas actuales.En resumen, Jane Eyre es una obra maravillosa que recomiendo a cualquier ser humano leer. Una novela totalizadora que no merece ser reducida a la calidad de una mera novelita rosa. Leedla."
321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4604943-sarai,Rating 5 out of 5,"I knew absolutely nothing about this book when I started reading it a few days ago. I knew that it was written by Charlotte Bronte, it was a favorite book for many, it was seen as a classic, and it was very long. But I knew nothing of the story or the characters (except for the obvious one, Jane Eyre). I avoided reviews so that I wouldn't get spoiled, and I started reading it with zero expectations. And I was floored.Jane Eyre as a character alone is plenty reason to love this book. Her narrative, her voice, was a complete surprise to me. I found her brave, sensible, independent, generous, and intelligent. She was a perfect character in my eyes but she herself had imperfections and weaknesses, and she freely commented on them in the book. I was completely infatuated with her storytelling. Jane's conscience became my own. Her struggles, her strange relationship with Mr. Rochester, her childhood and early womanhood--I felt a part of it all. Her narrative was so personal, uninhibited, and descriptive, that I truly felt I was the Reader she referred to on occasion, an invisible passenger accompanying her on her journey. Throughout the book I rooted for her, I grieved with her, and I wanted her to succeed and find peace. Other reviewers have commented on the fact that this is a dark novel, and I agree. Jane's childhood was painful to read almost. Some passages were so grave and bleak, I was as depressed as Jane felt. It just worked. Bronte writes in such a way that I could picture the darkness, the clouded skies, the creepy hallways, etc. I loved the scenery and didn't tire of Jane talking about it.While the other characters in the story played significant roles in Jane's life, to me they were always in the background. It's not that I didn't care about them or their relationships with Jane, I just wanted to solely concentrate on her and what was going to happen to her. There were a few twists in this book that took me for a loop and had me at the edge of my seat almost. I couldn't put the book down. When I did, I thought of Jane and what would happen next. Would she be happy? Would she marry St. John and submit to his repeated requests? Would she ever find Mr. Rochester? Would he ever find her? Was he even alive?Speaking of Mr. Rochester, what a strange man! What a difficult character to write. Bronte clearly didn't want Jane to have a knight in shining armor or an attractive stud. It was hard for me to appreciate Mr. Rochester at first. After reading so many YA novels I've gotten used to the usual love interests to these young female protagonists. They're either gorgeous or rich, mysterious and/or immortal, and perfect in every way. Mr. Rochester was a nice change from all of that, and so was Jane. When Mr. Rochester proposed to Jane the first time, I wanted her to be happy (like I said, I was very invested in the novel), morality and common sense be damned. I wanted her to rebel, take an opportunity and just be with the man. But when Jane held her ground I came to admire her all the more. Here's a woman with actual conviction and integrity. Who holds her values close and is willing to do the right thing, even if it costs her. And no stalking! Honestly it was a shock to the system.To me, Jane is a true inspiration. Her generosity, her ability to see past people's faults and overall looks, and her determination to do the right thing even if it left her alone and without an ""upstanding"" position is nothing short of admirable. So yes, count me into the ever-growing Jane Eyre fanclub! I'm so glad I finally took the time to read this amazing piece of literature. Bronte is a literary genius, and I'm all the better for it."
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2632212-steffi,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ich war wieder das Kind, das alle spannenden Geschichten verschlingt, die ihm in die Finger kommen. Ein Kind, das nicht unterscheidet zwischen Kitsch und Kunst, das keine Klischees kennt, das einfach nur in einer Geschichte versinkt, mitfiebert, liebt, leidet, heult, verdammt und die Welt um sich vergisst. Wann habe ich das letzte Mal auf diese Art gelesen? Als Kind vermutlich.Dann irgendwann entwickelten sich Geschmack, Kenntnisse, Vorlieben. Lernte man allzu oft breitgetretene Klischees zu erkennen und zu kritisieren. Etablierte man seinen Geschmack. Las man immer noch mit Herz und Bauch, aber zunehmend auch mit dem Verstand. Und letzterer schalt oft die Vorlieben von Herz und Bauch.Also was soll ich zu Jane Eyre sagen. Ich bin glücklich, dass ich diese fiebrige Leseerfahrung wieder haben konnte. Doch wenn ich aus der selten unterbrochenen Lektüre aufschaute, fragte ich mich: Ist das Literatur? Das Klischee der armen Waisen, die sich in den Adligen verliebt? Das Herrenhaus, in dem ein fürchterliches Geheimnis verborgen wird? Eine Welt, in der Vernunft und Bildung über Schönheit und Geld siegen? Die Sprache, die Dialoge, die vor Melodramatik nur so triefen?Ja, doch. Das ist Literatur. Weil alles was hier Klischee ist, von Brontë vielleicht nicht gerade erfunden (oder doch?) wurde, aber doch einen absoluten Höhepunkt. Wenn wir jetzt von Klischees sprechen, meinen wir die ungezählten Verfilmungen, Adaptionen, Nachahmungen, die Motive des Romans erst zu Klischees machten. Und dabei oft die Elemente beiseite ließen, die den Roman doch immer wieder vom Verdacht des Kitsches abrücken: Die Protagonisten sind – allen Verfilmungen zum Trotz – nicht schön, sie werden zum Teil sogar als ausgesprochen häßlich beschrieben. Und Jane ist eben nicht nur eine hilflose Waise und auch nicht nur das ehemals trotzige Kind, das sich einzufügen lernte. Und beschreibt der Roman nicht sehr treffend, die beschränkten Möglichkeiten einer gebildeten, aber mittellosen Frau zu dieser Zeit? Jane ist erstaunlich vielseitig, mal demütig, dann wieder unerschrocken und klug:Man sagt, Frauen seien im allgemeinen sehr ruhigen Naturells, doch Frauen empfinden genauso wie Männer. Sie brauchen ebenso wie ihre Brüder einen Tätigkeitsbereich, in dem sie ihre Fähigkeiten entfalten können. Sie leiden genauso wie Männer, wenn man ihnen allzu enge Fesseln anlegt und sie zu völliger Stagnation verurteilt. Es ist engstirnig von den bevorrechteten Männern, wenn sie sagen, Frauen sollen sich darauf beschränken, Pudding zu kochen und Strümpfe zu stricken, Klavier zu spielen und Taschen zu besticken. Es ist gedankenlos, sie zu verdammen oder auszulachen, wenn sie mehr tun oder mehr lernen wollen, als es sich nach den herkömmlichen Ansichten für ihr Geschlecht geziemt.Wie modern das klingt.Und doch fesselt mich Brontë immer wieder mit der Beschreibung von Seelenqualen, Herzschmerz und unm��glichen Leidenschaften. Und ich liebe es.Das Nachwort in meiner Ausgabe stammt von Klaus Mann. Ich war skeptisch, was er zu diesem Roman zu sagen hatte. Aber doch, er trägt ein paar grundlegende Fakten über die Familie Brontë zusammen und setzt sie in Verbindung zum Roman: Das Pfarrershaus, Pensionate, ein brennendes Bett, die Landschaft. Und er benennt Jane Eyre klar als Unterhaltungsroman, was seiner Anerkennung keinen Abbruch tut.Aber lest selbst! "
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13686880-yani,Rating 5 out of 5," Relectura en mayo 2014 (la anterior no la recuerdo xD) No sé cómo empezar a hablar de  Jane Eyre.  Tengo el mismo problema que con  Wuthering Heights,  por ejemplo: son libros que me exceden porque los amo y hablar de ellos es una responsabilidad. Argumento súper conocido: Jane Eyre es una niña huérfana que vive con una tía y tres primos insufribles (el más insoportable es el chico con aires de figura patriarcal). La tía, tan dulce ella (nótese la ironía), la envía a un internado para señoritas en donde no se sabe si la están educando para que sea una mujer instruida o si la finalidad es que aprenda a decir “sí, señor” a todo y a comer menos. Por suerte, Jane es de las que se rebelan. A medias, pero lo hace. Una vez que termina su aprendizaje allí, busca trabajo como institutriz y termina enseñándole a la protegida de Edward Rochester, un hombre rico, feo, gruñón y de ocurrencias hilarantes/ intimidantes. Y aquí viene lo interesante: la casa y el dueño tienen un secreto. Sí, como los protagonistas masculinos de las novelas románticas actuales, pero con más sentido común y más misterio.Charlotte Brontë escribe muy bien y delinea caracteres complejos, de esos que traen dolor de cabeza porque a veces uno los quiere y a veces los detesta. Lo importante es que no se olvidan. Jane es una jovencita que tiene una autodeterminación digna de un aplauso (salvo cuando flaquea y hace comentarios que me caen mal), Rochester es un personaje genial por su complejidad (los críticos, agradecidos) y los secundarios, si bien aparecen poco, cumplen con su papel y algunos merecen atención. La trama genera intriga gracias a una sucesión de hechos extraños que parecen elementos de una historia de terror, pero que no son tan típicos. Es difícil que provoque aburrimiento y, además, esconde bien las pistas que servirían para desenmarañar las cosas. Y lo que hay detrás de lo que se cuenta, todo lo que uno puede sacar de este libro para analizar, es fantástico. Jane Eyre  tiene una resolución y un final que desapruebo. Son algunas de las pocas cosas que no me gustan. Todo lo demás me encanta y vuelve a encantarme al releerlo. Jane transmite (está narrado en primera persona) sus alegrías y tristezas con mucha pasión y precisión, regalando párrafos hermosos y diálogos chispeantes de los cuales no puedo cansarme. Me queda mucho por leer de Charlotte Brontë todavía y ojalá que me obligue a calificar con veinte estrellas. Por ahora, este libro se mantiene en lo alto."
324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3982894-tj,Rating 4 out of 5,"THE REVIEWWhy this book?Because every heroine in almost every book I read seemed to have read itWhat I thoughtI heard of Jane Eyre growing up who hasn’t? What shocks me is how much I hear about it in most books I read. So I got to ask the question, what is so special about Jane Eyre? Well I’m going to tell you. Bronte’s Writing is effortless, the story is gripping, and every character is memorable. Jane Eyre fills you with so much emotion at times you fill like you’re going to burst. It grabs your heart and doesn’t let go. You feel so much for Jane and her non fairytale life. This is a book that is not easy to put down unless you absolutely have to. Many women change themselves for love, Jane does not. She stays an independent woman no matter how much she loves Mr. Rochester. Speaking of Mr. Rochester their relationship is so passionate even without sex, they had banter that puts a smile on my face and moments that took my breath away! Jane Eyre is one of those classics you must read, you will be doing yourself a favor if you did!"

En este caso me daba miedo que se me hiciera pesado, por eso lo posponía, pero ha sido todo lo contrario, he disfrutado mucho de Jane Eyre, de toda su andadura en la vida, con sus desgracias, sus logros, su valentía y del Sr Rochester con ese carácter tan suyo que al final te roba el corazón, todo eso narrado de forma exquisita, con unas descripciones perfectas (en algún caso en exceso), esos diálogos entre Jane y Rochester inolvidables, sin duda una historia maravillosa. En verdad si me ha gustado tanto le debería de dar la máxima puntuación, pero quizás han habido escenas que eran más pesadas, pero eso es totalmente subjetivo, y me hacía más lenta la lectura. "

Το βιβλίο ξεκινά αφηγούμενο την όχι και τόσο ευχάριστη ζωή της δεκάχρονης Τζέιν Έιρ και από την πρώτη σελίδα αισθάνθηκα τη μαγεία της Βικτωριανής εποχής να με περιβάλλει. Οι συχνές επικλήσεις της ηρωίδας προς τον αναγνώστη έκαναν τη γραφή ζωντανή και οι περιγραφές της Σάρλοτ Μπροντέ μπορούσαν μέσα σε δύο γραμμές να με τηλεμεταφέρουν στην αγγλική εξοχή (σε βαθμό που μπορούσα να αισθανθώ τον αέρα και την κίνηση των δέντρων). Ερωτεύτηκα την τόσο δυναμική για εκείνη την εποχή ηρωίδα που ήθελα τόσο πολύ να ζει ελεύθερη και να κάνει τις δικές τις επιλογές. Τέλος, παρόλο που η μετάφραση δεν ηταν τέλεια, η συγκεκριμένη έκδοση ήταν πανέμορφη."

La narrazione è più scorrevole di quanto immaginassi e adoro Jane, mi rivedo molto in lei. Il suo carattere, i suoi desideri e le sue insicurezze sono piuttosto simili ai miei.La traduzione, tanto criticata da tutti, non mi è dispiaciuta. Non è l'italiano che parliamo oggi, ma devo dire che ho apprezzato che venisse usato un linguaggio più simile all'epoca in cui è ambientata la storia.Un vero peccato che nel film non abbiano incluso la scena in cui Rochester si traveste da indovina e interroga Jane sui suoi sentimenti per lui, perché mi ha fatto morire😂😂😂"
