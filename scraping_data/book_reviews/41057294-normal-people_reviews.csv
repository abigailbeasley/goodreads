While this can be considered relatively high for me (don’t check my average rating, it will only bring despair to us both), it is approximately two stars lower than what I expected to rate this book.I adore Rooney’s prior novel, Conversations with Friends, to a degree that is almost disturbing. Or possibly just disturbing.But this one fell flat for me. In a way that was difficult, at the time, to put a finger on. While I encountered the same stellar, almost painful writing, and the same reading experience so all-encompassing that it felt like it changed something fundamental about me, while I loved the characters so much that my concern for their well-being stressed me out, I did not come away from this book in love.I put a finger on what the thing keeping me and this book away from eternal love and matrimony was. It’s because I was sad.The first time I read this, I was so wrapped up in the characters and their lives and my concern for them that I overlooked...everything else. To me this was the story of Connell and Marianne and nothing else, and while I adored them both I missed out on the multitude of nuances and themes and symbols at play. The treatment of privilege and wealth, the examination of capitalism through relationships, the look at what love and self-worth mean, the submission and sometimes humiliation that is love.This is a gorgeous book, and a beautifully written one, and the second read of this enthralled me so much I lived in the story for a week.For once, I’m at a loss for what else to say.Bottom line: I was wrong, okay!!! There’s a first time for everything.p.s. In the original review I say that I'll never reread this book. That wrongness counts as the same one.---------------------reread 2 updatesi am swiftly abandoning this reread because i'm not enjoying it and i'm scared.update: resuming in light of how soon sally rooney's next book is coming out. still scared.update to the update: this stays 4 stars!---------------------reread pre-reviewraising this from 3 to 4 stars upon reread, so guess i have to rewrite this review.oh, the twists and turns life takes.review to come / 4 stars---------------------reread 1 updatesmaybe someday i will be the kind of person who doesn't take every excuse to reread, but today is not that day---------original reviewWhen I finished this book, I didn’t even rate it. I couldn’t. I had no clue how to even approach such a thing.I still don’t.That’s because I loved reading every single word of this (because every single word of this was written by Sally Rooney), but I also, in a much more real way, did not enjoy at all.Conversations with Friends, which I five starred, reread just a few months after my first read, and have not stopped thinking about, is not an easy book to read. I adore it, but I did not enjoy every second of it.Far from it, actually. That book’s characters are part of my heart, but I didn’t necessarily like them. I felt intensely and deeply known by its story, and that process doesn’t necessarily feel like a walk in a park. Well, maybe it is. But on one of those days where when you first go outside the temperature is perfect in a long-sleeve shirt, but then you spend every minute outside growing slightly chillier to the point of discomfort. And you’re excited to see the park has little ice-cream carts, but then you realize the process of eating the ice cream ultimately won’t live up to your imagining of it, and you don’t really like ice cream all that much anyway.If that’s Conversations with Friends…Normal People is a walk in a park during a blizzard. Without a jacket. And to distract yourself you have an ongoing internal monologue that’s actually sort of brilliant, you’re in rare form, and that’s great and all but it’s not quite enough to distract from the fact that all of this seems pointless and rather painful.It really seems to me that Rooney abandoned the gorgeous, deep characterizations and slow-moving stories of Conversations in favor of making characters vessels for themes.And I’ve simply never been that kind of a reader. I read FOR the characters, not around them.I didn’t much care for Connell and Marianne, nor their romance (if you can call it that). I couldn’t click with their arcs or their escapades or much of anything, besides Rooney’s writing. (Which was unchangedly amazing and possibly even better.)There were also some things about this that made me feel...icky. Sexual submission (specifically Marianne’s) is used as a metaphor here, and never kindly. This behavior of hers is presented as negative, usually, but it’s also inarguable that Marianne is submissive in her relationship with Connell, and that is never resolved. Connell feels unhappy several times over about the degree of her power over her, and while they return to their relationship contentedly towards the end, this is not at all resolved.I missed the lovely, tied-strings ending of Conversations.Conversations made me feel heard, made my heart and brain feel full, and Normal People made me feel...almost dumb. As if I was missing something that would have helped me put it all together, and without it of course it felt incomplete, silly, because I didn’t have the intellectual capacity to complete it.It’s possible this just isn’t the book I needed, when Conversations with Friends certainly was.It was still written by Sally Rooney, though.Bottom line: I will never reread this. Also I desperately need more Rooney.Update: I reread.---------------------pre-reviewi......cannot even rate this right now.review to come, when i regain the ability to think---------------------tbr reviewi want Sally Rooney to write my internal monologue"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9429655-luce-cry-baby,Rating 2 out of 5,"Disclaimer: I understand that Normal People is very popular and much beloved. While I recognise that Rooney has talent, I found Normal People to be a mediocre read. If you dislike reading reviews expressing opinions different from your own, well, I suggest you skip this review. There are plenty of glowing reviews out there for this novel so there really is no need for you to waste your time leaving me a comment along the lines of 'you are wrong and here's why'. Also, note that I wrote this review in 2018 and not recently.If you believe that characters who dislike themselves, shrug a lot, and say ""I don't know"" 24/7, are very deep and realistic, well this may be the perfect read for you. Or if you enjoy reading about ""in"" authors...look no further.If you are thinking about reading this novel, I suggest you listen to Crywank's 'Song for a Guilty Sadist' instead, since it will take you less time and you will get the same story.At first I enjoyed Rooney's style, the way in which she juxtaposed ordinary moments with emotionally charged ones and the uncertainty that pervaded her story, but I soon found her style rather hollow and impersonal, in a manner that soon became predictable. There was a flatness to her voice that seemed affected, and gave her story an artificial quality. I had the impression that Rooney was trying to conjure a certain millennial ""vibe"" through her characters and their experiences, one that isn't all that effective or interesting.The central figures of her novel, Connell and Marianne, lacked depth and, as stupid as it might sound, character. Their looks were emphasised in a way that made them ""stand out"" from others: they are skinny and beautiful, they smoke, they make languid movements, they are smart, and unlike their peers they actually care about world politics. Throughout the course of this novel we are told how different and special they are, that's literally me type of characters.Marianne comes from a wealthy and abusive family (we are supposed to feel bad for her), Connell was raised by his mother and suffers from bouts of anxiety and depression (we are also supposed to feel bad for him). That they have issues that they can't cope with is realistic, but what I didn't appreciate is the romanticising of their difficulties. What I didn't like is that being ""alienated"" is synonym of ""cool"" and that seeking sadomasochistic relationships is understandable/inevitable if you come from an abusive family (i understand that this happens, and a lot of media manages to portray this reality, that of being a victim who either choose or fall into toxic relationship, or actively seek partners or friendships that emulate old patterns of abuse, with nuance, depth even. but rooney doesn't, for all her attempts at candid reality, her depiction of this struck me as sentimental and simplistic).Rooney handles serious issues (eg. an abusive family, depression, etc.) very badly (a book that handles trauma and self-harming incredibly well is What Red Was by Rosie Price), there we see why the characters behave in self-destructive ways, but in NP these things seem merely props).Marianne and Connell aren't terrible people but god, they are so self-involved. Their relationship is made to appear fraught but I didn't always understand why. Drama for the sake of drama? They enter forgettable relationships with equally forgettable people but they remain fixated on each other. Why? No one knows...Marianne is depicted by the author and the other characters as being the sort of person who does not to care about others' opinion of her but soon after a breakup with a cliched dick boyfriend she is obsessed with what people are saying about her...Connor is...intelligent? Indecisive? As interesting as a stale sandwich?!Secondary characters and family members are barely sketched out, they have little to no purpose other than creating more ""drama"" for the main characters. Marianne's family was so badly written that I had a hard time taking any of them seriously. Her brother is laughably cruel and her mother is uncaring and snobbish (they are rich so...). Friends from college serve very little purpose, other than making the main characters seem ""different"" and ""real"" (they are special, not like other people).What I disliked the most is that by the end neither Marianne or Connell show any sort of character growth/change. Not that I always want to read about characters who learn from their mistakes or gain some sort of insight from their experience, I can appreciate characters who keep perpetuating their 'bad' behaviour or even those who get worse or regress into 'bad' habits/behaviour, some of my favourite novels feature characters unable or unwilling to put an end to their self-sabotaging ways. But they have to be believable. Marianne or Connell were not. They were merely an 'aesthetic', more befitting as subjects of a black and white grunge photo than anything else. The only reason why I finished this novel is that I listened to the audiobook and the narrator managed to make this otherwise unappetising storyline sort of okay."

No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.
This is going to be a polarizing book. I mean, I think I liked it. And I say ""liked it"" in the sense that it made me very miserable. It is a quiet character study, almost a YA novel but not quite, and it is a profoundly lonely and depressing love story.I didn't begin by liking it. Normal People follows two characters - Marianne and Connell - through adolescence and into early adulthood, and they begin by being the kind of uber-precocious teenagers who read Proust and Marx for fun. It took a while for me to settle into their story. My initial impression was that this was going to be some kind of John Green for adults, which is not something that floats my particular boat.Without fully realizing it though, this book had crept quietly under my skin. The relationship between Marianne and Connell is angsty, sure, but it felt painfully real. They are so flawed, marred by unlikable characteristics, and yet, I could not stop caring about them.
Not for the first time Marianne thinks cruelty does not only hurt the victim, but the perpetrator also, and maybe more deeply and more permanently. You learn nothing very profound about yourself simply by being bullied; but by bullying someone else you learn something you can never forget.
The story is really just about the two of them and their relationship. In high school, Marianne is a smart and wealthy girl, but is socially ostracized and emotionally abused at home, whereas Connell is working class, but very popular. Connell's mum works as a cleaner for Marianne's family. They begin a secret sexual relationship that falls apart when Connell fears his friends will find out. The compelling dynamic between them drives the story-- issues of class and social status cause much conflict.In college, the two meet again. This time, Marianne is popular, and Connell is feeling increasingly depressed. The two of them lean on each other time and again as they move through a social world filled with social expectations. There's a bit of a When Harry Met Sally vibe, except that this book is more soul-destroying.
Nothing had meant more to Rob than the approval of others; to be thought well of, to be a person of status. He would have betrayed any confidence, any kindness, for the promise of social acceptance.
There's clear criticism of our constant need to impress and perform for others in a world that grows ever more connected. Much of the tragedy that befalls Marianne and Connell is caused by other people, peer pressure and social expectations. It is very sad to think that someone might give up who they love the most because they can't deal with how it makes them look to others.The pair's inability to adequately communicate is frustrating but feels realistic. I was on the verge of tearing my hair out at all the things left unsaid in this book, but I think it was a good kind of frustration. The kind that comes from caring too much. I feel like there are any number of reasons I could have hated Normal People, but I didn’t. I actually kinda loved it. It's a weird, awkward, depressing novel about a connection formed between two very different people who find exactly what they need - and perhaps a lot that they don't - in each other.

3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6677659-marchpane,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sally Rooney is the real dealNormal People has been lavished with praise from critics, longlisted for the Man Booker prize and adapted for television by the BBC. And that's just in its first week of publication! All that attention will, no doubt, attract quite a few readers who would not ordinarily touch this subject with a barge pole. Because this book:A)	Is about young peopleB)	Is a love story (but not a 'romance novel')C)	Contains a fair bit of sex (which is crucial to the storytelling, btw, and is not graphic)All of which (possibly also the fact that the author is a 27-year-old woman) means that Normal People will inevitably be dismissed by some as frivolous. It isn’t. This is a confident, accomplished and serious work. Of Rooney’s debut, Conversations with Friends, I said in my review it ‘occasionally scrapes close to the bone’. Well, Normal People cuts to the core.Normal People is not out to inspire, instruct, entertain or talk down to anyone, which makes it something of a refreshing anomaly in current fiction about young people. It is a novel (for anyone, young or old) that simply presents the truth of youthful experiences without the filters of nostalgia or sentimentality. It invites you to inhabit the psyche of someone else – two someone elses: Connell and Marianne – to identify with them and to feel their pain and turmoil. For the reader who connects to that, it is wracking. The story focuses only on the pivotal moments for these two characters, jumping forward three weeks, six months, or five minutes, as needed, to excise all the uneventful bits of life and leave us with the most emotionally intense supercut possible. It follows them from high school in a small town, through their years at university in Dublin, as the dynamic between them shifts with their surroundings and social circle. They’re not officially 'together' the whole time, or even most of the time, but they always figure in each other’s lives in a significant way.Sally Rooney writes with such precision that this all feels painfully true. She conjures the tension and emotion in a scene just from the way someone wrings out a dish sponge; she conveys the full weight of feeling from a look or a shrug. In Rooney’s imagining, Connell and Marianne as separate entities are less important than the interplay between them – their relationship dynamic and the influence each of them has on shaping the other, that’s the real stuff of this book: 
""How strange to feel herself so completely under the control of another person, but also how ordinary. No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.""

There’s irony here, and self-conscious posturing (though not nearly as much as in CWF), but earnestness, truth and kindness as well. In addition to the central relationship are issues of class and intellectual integrity. It's a particularly astute look at the rebuild of self that teenagers undergo in the transition from school to uni, how it allows some to thrive while others stumble, and in some ways is just an illusion after all. So there’s hype and there’s backlash to the hype, and Normal People is sure to resonate powerfully with some readers and not at all for others. If you like a minutely observed novel about people and feelings that isn’t mawkish, I'd say give it a go."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4617856-trudie,Rating 1 out of 5,"I am not sure how to write this review because I seem to be so far beyond the pale on my antipathy to this book. In simplest terms I didn't connect with this work at all and I would be best to chalk this up to a ""reader/writer"" mismatch and move on but I will try and articulate some of my reading experience.Some of my perplexity with Normal People is that I just couldn't relate to the twenty something, highly educated, politically aware and cynical young adults that populate this novel. I am not sure how reflective these voices are of young Irish making their way in the world, but as presented here I found them exasperating to listen to and not particularly nuanced. It is possible that even if I didn't enjoy the novel I might like the writing but in actual fact Rooney's style is perhaps the single biggest thing that bugged me. I found some passages of interest sandwiched between a lot of wooden dialogue and these flat descriptions ... Marianne goes inside and comes back out again with another bottle of sparkling wine, and one bottle of red. Niall starts unwrapping the wire on the first bottle and Marianne hands Connell a corkscrew. Peggy starts clearing people's plates. Connell unpeels the foil from the top of a bottle as Jamie leans over and says something to Marianne. He sinks the screw into the cork and twists it downwards. Peggy takes his plate away and stacks it with the others This kind of writing really gives me nothing. Others have cited the two dimensional nature of her secondary characters and I would concur. Barely any of them made much of an impression on me. Alan - Marianne's brother, seemed particularly badly drawn. He appears to be a key part of understanding Marianne and yet he warrants only a few pen-strokes of unexplained malice and cruelty. The opening of a wine-bottle and pouring of cups of tea receives much more page space. I tried to understand Marianne, who seems to be both ugly and beautiful, popular and friendless. Her hinted at troubled family life was suppose to underpin her need to be a submissive. I remain unconvinced that this is really how dominance and submission works and I would think experts in BDSM might strongly take issue with some of the cliches here. The relationship between Marianne and Connell should have kept this book afloat at the very least. The intense emotional and physical connection, the will they / won't they stay together, all the drama of YA love is here but it is in an eye-wateringly navel-gazing form. I found it all exactingly po-faced. The number of inexplicable break-ups, largely based on mis-communication was about three or four break-ups too many for me. I just wanted to yell at this novel most of the time. Say what you mean and stop being so insufferably difficult !, either split up or stay together, both your friends and I really don't care !. Marianne and Connell were of most interest to me when they started emailing each other, discussing novels and politics thus preventing them breaking up over some new emotional minutiae. Perhaps this should have been a novel of their email exchanges.Oh well, I guess I will never be a Rooney fan and I have doubtless missed the point of this book entirely but that is ok not every book is for every reader."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 3 out of 5,"Normal People starts out beautifully. Marianne is a loner in high school with no friends, while Connell is the popular football player. His mom works as a cleaner at Marianne's house, so they run into each other when he stops by to pick up his mom. Over time, they start to thaw around each other, growing closer as they realize that they can be their true selves when they are together.Rooney captures so well the vulnerability and awkwardness of teenage years, along with its exuberance and infinite possibility. It was sweet to follow along to Marianne and Cornell's developing relationship. Even though there is the stress of school and the pressure of being teenagers, when they are alone together, they can be free to express themselves and be who they really are.Then they are off to college, and the dynamics change. Marianne becomes the popular one, and Connell becomes the loner with no friends. At this point, I start to realize Rooney captures a very black and white version of high school and college. You are either part of the popular obnoxious crowd or you are a nobody with no friends, and there is nothing in between. And everyone's ultimate goal was to be in the popular crowd. But that isn't the school experience I remember, so it became harder and harder for me to connect with this book. In my experience, people had several different groups of friends, and no one liked obnoxious people. Most were working so hard that they didn't have time to worry about popularity and how others regarded them, especially in college.This story has a very YA feel to it, where the characters are filled with angst and lack emotional maturity. While that made sense when Marianne and Connell were in high school, as the story progressed through their college years, it didn't anymore. The two seem to love each other, and yet, they are so sensitive to perceived slights that innocent conversations would quickly escalate to a breakup. Honest communication would clear this up immediately, but they don't do that. Instead, they circle and prod each other until they are back together again. Then the cycle repeats. It's all very dramatic, but it left me pretty apathetic by the end of the book.This book also tackles the subject of abuse, but I think it was a missed opportunity here. Rooney portrays abuse as if some people just want to be abused, so they will let anyone abuse them, and even go around looking for it until they find it. That's not right. Victims have trouble escaping because abusers are often the people they love most, who treat them well most of the time and express regret after an incident. But there is no love or good treatment in this book, so it doesn't make sense that the victim would just put up with it.In the end, I thought the first half of this book was wonderful, but everything stagnated in the second half. The main characters never really grew up, so they repeated the same mistakes over and over again. Their lack of maturity and insight into themselves and their relationships grated on me. I went into this book with really high hopes, but ultimately it didn't live up to its potential."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem,Rating 1 out of 5," Man booker prize long list nominee and Costa book awards nominee This is a book that has many admirers and sadly it didn't work for me and while I would love to agree with all the judges on this one I only struggled to the end because it was a bookclub read. It is difficult to go against the grain on a book that is nominated for so many awards. So as always you  need to judge for yourself because books fit people differently  Quite simply this book didn't  Fit Me. I really have no interest in reading about 18-20 something year college kid's on/off sexual relationships where they seem to only exist in their own little complex bubble and this book felt like a bubble. It is described as ""exquisite love stroy"" which I honestly found nothing exquisite or no love in this one. The characters of Connell and Marianne were dislikable and boring and the on / off, will they wont they ""relationship"" became repetitive reading. The only character which I liked and felt any connection with in the novel was Lorraine.Perhaps this is more suited for a younger audience where they connect with the college scene or for readers who like complex relationship stories but for me this was a struggle from start to finish."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10171516-jessica,Rating 3 out of 5,"wow. one of the most frustrating, but humanising, books i have read in a long time. for sure. i feel so exhausted after reading this, but i think that may have been the authors intent. its shows that normal people living normal lives can be quite tiresome. for example:- the writing lacks quotation marks, which makes the dialogue difficult to decipher. which could be seen as support for the idea that life is just as messy as the books formatting and communication sometimes takes effort to understand. - there are massive jumps in the timeline with a lot of backtracking, so much so that the drastic shifts are jarring. which could be seen as exemplifying the notion that people change over time and friendships are bound to alter.things like this will polarise readers. either its too much and unenjoyable, or its a work of genius and adds depth to the storytelling. i think it really depends on the readers interpretation and mood. and like the indecisive creature that i am, im quite torn down the middle. ↠ 3.5 stars"

17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,Rating 2 out of 5,"Let it be known that I found this book both exhilarating and almost unbearably frustrating. About halfway through the book I literally lied down on my couch and screamed to my empty apartment, “Connell, you are such an incompetent communicator, I swear to God herself if you don’t help yourself I’m going to loathe every person named Connell I ever encounter for the rest of my life.” Even though I’m giving this book 2 stars, it’s more out of how invested I felt in the characters and how little I felt Sally Rooney capitalized on their potential, and not out boredom – I felt anything but bored reading this novel. I will start with what I liked about Normal People before I continue roasting Connell. Now having read both Conversations with Friends and Normal People, I find Rooney’s dialogue so, so sharp and entertaining. It’s witty and interesting and realistic, smart yet sincere enough so that it rarely feels pretentious. Some combination of how she writes dialogue and scenes is just so compelling, like I felt propelled to keep reading even when I felt tired of Connell and Marianne and their poor choices. Rooney also weaves in astute commentary about class and socioeconomic status. A few of the passages about class really made me pause and reflect on my own socioeconomic privilege, which I appreciate. At the same time, my best friend pointed out how ultimately Marianne and Connell’s whiteness both afford them the opportunity to be continually mediocre in ways that people of color are often not given, which I agree with. Which brings me to my main critique of this book: Connell and Marianne’s relationship felt so, so annoying and inhibiting. It honestly felt like reading an interpersonal train wreck that I could not look away from, even though I would have much rather looked at anything else (e.g., attractive actors like Steven Yeun, BlackPink music videos, the ceiling of my apartment, etc.) On one hand, I totally get and appreciate that people miscommunicate with one another and experiencing or working through miscommunications is part of life. But Connell and Marianne’s miscommunication literally drives the plot of this book for like, the first 200 pages, and even after that they never really have an explicit conversation about their communication and its indirectness? The majority of this book felt like: Marianne and Connell are intimate, then they have a miscommunication (probably caused by Connell), then they somehow reunite and are intimate again, but then they have another miscommunication (also probably Connell’s fault, like yes I get class factors into this but dang he’s a poor communicator), then they’re intimate, then they miscommunicate, etc. until the end. Finally, I felt like Marianne’s character had so much unexplored depth and potential. She goes through so much: abandonment, familial abuse, trauma and disordered eating, to name a few. Rooney did such a nice job showing some of the effects of her experiences on her psyche and view of relationships. Yet, instead of really going deeper into her struggles or her potential path to healing, Rooney dedicates the majority of the book to Marianne’s relationship with Connell, which I found almost insulting to Marianne’s character. I recognize I may be being a bit harsh here, on one hand I get that Marianne is desperate for some form of healthy connection as we all are to some extent, yet I so, so wish Rooney had given Marianne the chance to heal or develop more within the scope of the novel, so we could see that on the page and feel that hope for her. Instead, toward the very end of the book, Marianne essentially attributes all the goodness in her life to Connell, which made me blanch a little (while sitting on the same couch in which I cursed Connell’s name). Despite my 2-star rating of this novel and my 3-star rating of Conversations with Friends, I still feel somewhat compelled to try out whatever book Rooney publishes next, just because of the sheer addictiveness of her dialogue. There is some quality content in Normal People, about consent and power within sex, about mental health and help-seeking as well. I wish there had been more growth for these characters, outside of their relationship, especially for Marianne."
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline,Rating 1 out of 5,"***NO SPOILERS***This is one of the most overrated books I've read in a long time, and I'm stunned it was long-listed for the Women's prize and the Booker prize (but then, I usually dislike what's chosen for that). The critics are gushing over it too. A professional review I saw in “Book Page” calls it “wise and wondrous.” I ask this: How? How is Rooney’s message “wise”? Show me what’s “wondrous.” I’ve read wondrous and wise many times before. Those are the transportive books I never forget. They overwhelm me in the best way. Everything about Normal People underwhelmed me. Though Rooney’s simplistic prose makes Normal People easy to read, the book is poorly organized, overly sexual, plot-less, and ultimately never comes together in a satisfying way. Considering how ordinary, often boring, most people’s lives are, her book actually is about “normal people,” but I expect authors to dress up the everyday. I expect tension, some drama, maybe a little suspense. I need a plot with a compelling reason for being. Normal people’s lives don’t make for good stories as they are; they require tinkering. A story about two friends-with-benefits who are confused about what they mean to each other isn’t a story. It’s merely the rough outline for a layered, more meaningful story. Rooney’s intention was a story about miscommunication between close friends as they grow and have various life experiences--except there is no miscommunication. The characters are clear about how they feel. They profess their love for each other more than once. They have sex all the time. They show each other care and consideration. What I saw was unexplainable hesitance. In high school, Marianne is unpopular and rich; Connell is popular and poor, so early on this difference drives their hesitance and makes sense. I thought then that Normal People was going to be an exploration of how class and social difference can harm a relationship, a kind of contemporary Romeo and Juliet. Instead Rooney dropped this as soon as the characters move on to college, and their previous hesitance no longer makes sense. Where these characters’ class differences are concerned, development is shallow. Rooney didn’t illustrate how Marianne is unpopular and Connell popular or how Marianne is rich and Connell poor. She said that Marianne lives in a big house; she showed Connell’s housekeeper mother working for Marianne’s family a few times. That’s it, and Rooney could just as easily have made them the same level of popular and of the same class. I was continually confused about or forgot entirely most of the secondary characters because none have distinguishing features or much, if anything, to do. Marianne’s mother isn’t shown, just talked about matter-of-factly a few times. A cruel brother pops up here and there to dole out cruelty, then disappears. A boyfriend is callous and doesn’t stick around long enough to do anything interesting. A sub-plot about abuse is mildly intriguing but is apropos of nothing and ends in a flash. They all tease, hinting at Normal People’s unrealized potential to be phenomenal. Of course, normal people have lives that can change drastically and in unpredictable and sad ways, but translating that to the page necessitates a concrete story arc. I understand why some critics have called this book “stream-of-consciousness.” Rooney didn’t employ that writing technique, but the events, jumping as they do from one disconnected thing to the next, flashing backward and forward confusingly, are stream-of-consciousness in plot form. As a writing style, stream-of-consciousness is horrible, but in plot form it’s disastrous. I’ll go ahead and give Rooney another try with Conversations with Friends but with the lowest expectations."

I for one, was looking forward to reading this one. Along with everyone else (judging by how long I waited in the library queue😡). Sadly, it didn’t live up to the hype for me. ☹️These characters were not likable. They both have clear issues, but I’ve read plenty of books where the characters are flawed but you still root for them in the end. And don’t even get me started on the ending. 🙄"

They did amazing job by adapting this lyrical, poignant, sad and realistic story with remarkable, heartfelt performances! It is a real soul crusher, heartbreaker! Get ready to set your ugly cries free!!!!This really reminded me of those tear jerkers, Oh God I cannot breathe, all my happiness swept away by emotional vampires vacuum cleaners inc., come on, that’s kind of nerve bending story that one of the protagonist has to die from a deadly disease ( or both of them needed to die sometimes! Oh no another crying torrent coming up! I cannot hold it! I can’t)or one of them has to commit suicide kind of, depressive, sad, exhausting, giving you anxiety attacks kind of John Green books. (After looking for Alaska, I felt the a dark cloud always following me for one month and my husband fed me with soap and Chardonnay, as you can imagine I couldn’t eat solid food at least two months because I bit the pages of the book and chewed so hard, destroyed my dental implements!!!)So yes this book is sad, horrifyingly bringing your dark clouds and vultures above your head and interesting fact is nobody dies! But yes there are so many heavy, harsh, heart wrenching, brain cell boiling issues make you feel like hit by a truck several times, then suffered from waterboarding and torture conducted by American Psycho’s Patrick Bateman and finally thrown away into the swamp,eaten by crocodiles. The characters deal with drug addiction, bullying, sexual assault, suicidal thoughts, severe depression and it is really heartbreaking to see them not to have a regular teenager lives. And you know what after all those torturous feelings, my kindest part of soul( also my masochist brain cells and my vulnerable heart) loved those two characters, Connell and Marianne and witnessed their literally growing up, their adolescence and early adulthood times, forming friendship, special- sensitive bound. At first when they were in high school, Marianne is outcast, social pariah, bullied by mean girls as Connell is shiny, popular star of the school community. The part he didn’t take her to the prom was harsh, mean move and Connell lost his all his brownie points and earned slapping contest championship’s high rated asshole statue. But when they were in college, the balances were changed now Marianne is intellectual, independent, smart social queen and Connell loses his spotlight and sentenced to be an ordinary, invisible college boy which makes him more depressed and lonely.Their friends-lovers- again friends- again lovers kind of complex relationship and their story’s revelation should be called : “Restrained screams” or “Unsaid Words” , or “Bottled Up Emotions!” or “I think I’m really pissed off those two characters so much for breaking my heart !”I know the realistic conclusion was necessary, logical, reasonable but it doesn’t mean it is not hurting you so much!As a result, if you can deal with feeling blue by reading sad, sad, sad, OH GOD WHY THE HELL I CARED SO MUCH ABOUT THOSE CHARACTERS kind of book, this is just for you.I liked the captivating, realistic, poignant story telling and I truly accepted those broken, flawed, complex characters but I think sometimes their story made me suffocated a little.

I try not to attempt to write ""book reviews"" when I am mad because more than likely I will say something I will regret or just be super mean. In this instant I have to because I am so mad and so underwhelmed by this read and I want the hours I spent reading it back. #RefundOnTimeI try not to fall for the book hype but the hype around  Normal People  was relentless. I could not open Bookstagram and not see it and the RAVING reviews. In typical #BookstagramMadeMeDoIt I succumbed and read the book and I am kicking myself for doing so because this was not worth the hype.  Normal People  follows the lives of Connell and Marianne from their high school days to college. In High School Connell was popular and fully immersed into his social life and group of friends. Marianne was the opposite. Marianne and Connell ended up bein together but Connell didn't want anyone to know because it would affect his social standing. *roll eyes*… I mean seriously..... Anyway, fast forward to college and the tables turn, Marianne is now the belle of the ball and Connell is finding it hard to make friends of his own or assimilate to college life. Throughout high school and college Marianne and Connell are always finding a way back to each other.... If you are planning on reading this book, let me put you out of your misery. The ENTIRE book is Connell and Marianne going from, I want to be with you... I don't want to be with you... lets have sex.... I am not sure you love me.... I didn't say exactly what I mean two months ago, this is what I meant.... more I want to be with you... REPEAT 10 TIMES. I understand if the break-ups were because of groundbreaking things, they weren't. It was because of miscommunication and these grown ass individuals refusing to open their mouths and say exactly what they are thinking, feeling or asking. It was FRUSTRATING. SO FRUSTATING. Also this lead to zero character growth because up to the end of the book theres still miscommunication. Also I did not care for any of these characters they were so one dimensional and underwhelming. What a boring book. Ugh. Save yourself and your time, go read something else. #ThankMeLater"

24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 5 out of 5,"I had been influenced by a friend - whom I adore & respect - by her 1 star review.... way before this book started gaining momentum and hit the stores a month ago. This book wasn’t for my friend - but it sure was for me. I’ve own an ‘Advance Reader’s Edition’, of Sally Rooney’s paper copy for a year and a half. It sat on my shelf, unread. Rooney’s first novel “Conversations With Friends”, was wonderful. I admit having a thing for the type of writer Sally Rooney is:*Addicting* thought-provoking reading for me. “Normal People” is contemporary - romantic-tragic - comic - fresh - psychologically sharp - emotional - and very perceptive. Rooney leaves me lingering in her characters. They are flawed and frustrated. I ‘felt’ flawed and frustrated reading it! At times I wanted to scream at the characters - other times my heart just broke. I knew I wanted to read this novel. I even knew it would most likely drive me into my head. ( it did). I’m not sure why I didn’t open it last year. The book-cover alone has that ‘curl-up-and-get- sucked-in- feeling’, to it. And that’s exactly what happened. I COULD NOT STOP READING. ‘Addicted’! I will never doubt my own gut desire again when it comes to a Sally Rooney novel. I’m a fan here to stay. Totally love what she creates. SOMETHING HAS SHIFTED IN ME, too, with respect to romance novels. I can no longer say...“Oh, I don’t read romance novels”... It depends...Heck, “Crime and Punishment”, had romance. Loaded with power and cruelty... but still some romance. “East of Eden”, by John Steinbeck was filled with juicy romance...( destructive force)... but still...lust and romance was present. Helen Hoang’s book, “The Kiss Quotient”, more modern, had romance written all over it. I loved it, too. Laugh at me if you wish...but in the same way that I got hooked on the two main characters, ( Tessa and Hardin), in Anna Todd’s “After Series”.....( also a young author like Sally Rooney)....I was hooked on the relationship’ between Connell and Marianne in “Normal People”. I’m sure that Rooney would not turn this book into a series… but if she did, I’d read it. The electricity and entanglement between this Connell and Marianne - was soooo complex. I wanted to join their conversations about their families—about the way each felt about themselves, and each other.... and all the things that were happening to them. When I finished the last page, my mind continued swimming in thoughts. Most, I was sad to leave them. Soooo many fabulous sentences - page after page. Gorgeous reflective and intimate writing. Sally Rooney is an ‘it’ author for me. LOVED IT!!!! ....Ha... if you can’t tell. I’ll end with one expert: “All these years they’ve been like two little plants sharing the same pot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions”. "
25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant,Rating 2 out of 5,"I thought I’d do the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge, even though it’s just about winter here in Sherwood. But I think I’ll get away with it, you never see any police around here from one year to the next. Anyway, standards really aren’t what they were, I don’t even think anyone would care. In the old days if you did a summer reading challenge in winter you’d be out the door so fast your feet wouldn’t touch the ground. But these days people have neck tattoos and name their children after brands of paint remover so you can get away with anything. When I looked at the categories of the reading challenge I had to ditch a couple – “Read a Goodreads Choice Winner” was one – I mean, sorry Goodreads, not to eat the hand that feeds you and all but those Choice Awards are not my cup of tea at all. Fortunately the other categories fit neatly on to several stubborn denizens of my real life to be read shelves, so off I go. The category I’m doing here is “Read a ‘most read’ book” so I consulted the list and I found a copy of one of these popular works in my local Oxfam, and Normal People it is. NOT THAT NORMALThis turned out to be a kind of romance but at least it was the unromantic modern version, where we follow a couple from school (she’s rich and unpopular, he’s working class and beloved by all) to university (where it’s the other way round suddenly) and during this long peregrination they’re on-and-off shagging and loving and BFFing and pinging from one thing to the other like pinballs whilst at the same time recoiling in horror from acknowledging the plain fact that they’re made for each other, so they attempt and fail to have actual real boy/girlfriends and the real boy/girlfriends have no idea what’s really going on so this golden couple of Marianne and Connell have a permanent status of IT’S COMPLICATED. They have angst in their pangst.The short version of all that is to say that Normal People is the unfunny updated version of When Harry Met Sally or that it’s like if Ross and Rachel had absolutely no sense of humour or any charm at all and were all strictly gloomsville I-am-suffering because life is suffering, woe is us, woe is all of us. THE MASOCHISM TANGOIn the middle of this wall to wall fraughtness and gnashing of laptops we get to find out that the lovely Marianne has a masochistic streak. When she’s not with Connell she likes her boyfriends to beat her up.I think it’s now possible to construct a rough and ready scale of female masochism using novels I happen to have read or movies seen. Here are seven female protagonists rated out of ten on the masochism scaleAnastasia Steele in Fifty Shades of Grey...………………………….3Eileen Dunlop in Eileen......................................................…….4Lee Holloway in Secretary...………………...…………………………...6 Marianne Sheridan in Normal People...…………………………….7Nora in Topping from Below	......……………………......…...……….8Erika Kohut in The Piano Teacher...……………………......………..9O in Story of O...…...…………………………...…………………………….10O is the gold standard of female masochism. I can’t see O ever being beaten. THE WATER FROM THE TAP GOT WARMERThe soundtrack to Normal People I think would be a jarring mixture of Kraftwerk, Leonard Cohen and late Billie Holliday, when her voice was all hoarse and ruined. What Normal People does is to describe at length a hot mess of a relationship in cool, affectless sentences, some of which go way too far with their cool and affectlessnessThe outside door closes and Marianne re-enters the kitchen. She rinses her water glass and leaves it upside down on the draining board.Many pages laterThe water from the tap got warmer and Marianne put the plug in the sink and squeezed a little dish soap onto a sponge. And many pages laterMarianne drank a single cup of black coffee and ordered a croissant which she didn’t finish. Connell had a large ham-and-cheese omelette with two slices of buttered toast, and tea with milk in it.Meanwhile, our tall handsome working class star student Connell suffers from a book-length inarticulacy that is distressing to witness. He’s all “that was weird”, “I don’t know”, “I’ll have to think about it”, “Kind of” and “That was weird”.As regards the plot, there’s not much to see here, it’s really just beads on a string. One thing - I had a problem with Marianne’s family, only a mother and a brother, but they both seem to hate her, for reasons never explained. I mean, give us a hint, Sally. Just a little hint. But you know what, I read this in two big gulps, it was weirdly compelling, similar to another much beloved and not that great campus novel The Secret History. So that’s something. I read many novels that I find extremely putdownable and unpickupable. This was not one of those. SO, DID YOU LIKE IT?It’s complicated. 2.5 stars."
26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110358466-ava,Rating 4 out of 5,"In short, I find this book to be refreshingly real. Never have I read a young-adult romance book that feels so realistic to what happens in real life sometimes. It's not always boy meets girl and they live happily together with hardly any issues. This book has depth and complexity, which sometimes is lacking in romance books. The interactions and conversations that Rooney writes about feels so real and true. I loved how she touches on real issues that young adults experience as they enter a new era of life (college). While reading I kept wondering.. ""Will they even end up together?"" Both Connel and Marianne (the main characters) are exploring new intimate and sexual relationships outside of their own. This is a compelling modern love story, one that deserves all of the attention it gets."
27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6431467-s-penkevich,Rating 4 out of 5,"‘Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything.’The directions our lives take are often shaped by those around us, particularly actions made out of love. Normal People, the second novel by the acclaimed writer Sally Rooney, is a moving narrative of the steps and missteps of young love as two people grow into themselves in a troubled world of class divide and social pressures. The book follows Connell and Marriane from their first days as secret lovers in high school through their tumultuous friendship--often sexual--at Trinity College, Dublin. Normal People is at its best when addressing the social issues of class, which she brilliantly uses sex as a medium to elaborate on the power dynamics and dehumanizations of capitalism. While there are a few problematic moments regarding Marianne’s preference towards submission that seems to disregard her autonomy in her own sexuality and assume that the preference is the hallmark of being “damaged”, Rooney manages to very accurately describe modern love in a way that expresses the complexities in all their untidy beauty, as well as the social posturing and emotions of college years. Through using sex as a navigational device across society and told in a sparse, matter-of-fact style that doesn’t impose an authorial judgement over the events in favor of acknowledging the reader’s ability in being able to decode for themselves, Normal People is a success that is nearly impossible to put down.	Great news, Rooney more that lives up to the hype. The press releases marketed Irish writer Sally Rooney as the “first great millennial novelist”--a fairly eye-rolling label clearly intended to hit nerves and spark conversation in what also seems a constant attempt from the gatekeepers of older generations to minimize or infantilize the millennial generation--and her name has achieved pop-culture accolades recalling Elena Ferrante from a few years ago. Even Taylor Swift recently came out of the woods to recommend Rooney’s first novel, Conversations with Friends. Speaking of eye-rolling marketing, Conversations was hailed as the “Salinger of the Snapchat Generation,” which seems like something impossible to proclaim unironically. In all this misguided and lazy-label hype that seems half intent on wishing for her downfall, Rooney is an utter delight to read and Normal People is a wonderful achievement. If she is a ""Salinger of Snapchat""? That is up to you to decide (personally I hate that label too much to make a judgement call), but is Normal People an original and insightful accomplishment? Definitely.	Normal People begins with Connell and Marianne in high school as what seems like caricatures of themselves. If initially their characters feel a touch cliche, it is because we are all a bit of a cliche at that age. Connell is the smart, athletic type concerned how others think on him whereas Marianne is an outcast who is considered strange for daring to be an intellectual woman and not caring what others think of her (okay, maybe it is a little overly cliche, but bear with me here). After a secret relationship--Connell being concerned his friends will know they are sleeping together in a way that is outright abusive--they part ways only to reunite at Trinity College where now Connell is the quiet outsider and Marianne the center of attention. A turning of the tables he deserves as in high school he had a sense his social status made him too good for her and he deeply hurt her because of it as ‘ his attraction to her felt terrifying, like an oncoming train, and he threw her under it’. The novel launches from here into many turnings-of-the-table, complicated friendships and near-misses, with each seemingly caught in each others gravity no matter what they do or who they are with. ‘It's funny the decisions you make because you like someone, he says, and then your whole life is different. I think we're at that weird age where life can change a lot from small decisions.’It is truly moving seeing the ways a person’s trajectory in life can be so shaped by those around them. Being set at the start of this decade, the artifacts of the era--such as a scene discussing economic policy while listening to the first Vampire Weekend album--were deeply nostalgic for me and reminded me what life was like in the age of the characters. While some might decry them as overdramatic or bold representations of themselves, remembering who you were at the age of 19 and all the social posturing of that period is a good way to really appreciate how well Rooney captures the age frame of her characters. The social dynamics of a college campus are really well done. Marianne, for example, is honestly interested and invested in social justice and politics, but a girlfriend of Connell’s assumes her discussions about it at parties as a grab for attention. Connell, on the other hand, is very well read but doesn’t name drop books the way others do and is suspected of being uncultured and dumb by Marianne’s male make-a-show-of-being-cultured friends (you know the type: the guy that will tell you information about Ian Curtis without you asking, corrects someone’s pronunciation of Sarte, and casually leaves work-in-progress art lying around but acts annoyed if you comment on it, as a friend recently put it).
He did gradually start to wonder why all their classroom discussions were so abstract and lacking in textual detail, and eventually he realised that most people were not actually doing the reading. They were coming into college every day to have heated debates about books they had not read.
The society at the Uni is very much indicative of social class, Connell at one point telling his therapist he has actually witnessed students argue over which of their father’s make more money. Being a working class outsider, or a ‘culchie’ as the slang goes, he observes that many of the excessively rich students like the notoriety of intelligence more than actually having to be intelligent.
It was culture as class performance, literature fetishised for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they might afterwards feel superior to the uneducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about.
It becomes an act of superiority to state you’ve read a book or have a stern opinion on a political topic, which, actually having a working knowledge of these and caring about them does give Marianne an easy “in” with this culture and luckily Rooney spares the reader an impression of C & M as authentic and the rest as Salinger “phoneys”. It’s implied, but handled well.While Rooney occasionally dips into caricatures of college-types for minor characters, her primary characters are nuanced and complex in a way that, by the end of the book, you feel you shared your time with real people. Both Marianne and Connell are problematic at times--especially Connell and his sexual hangups or his impressions of Marianne as “damaged”--but Rooney invests emotional insights into them that grants them a real sense of authenticity. Unlike the first person narration of Conversations, Normal People is told from a very unaffected third-person omniscient perspective that refrains from making judgements on the characters. You see their faults and their inner-justifications or griefs but the reader is left on their own to decide what to make of them. There are times when either character will disgust or frustrate you, and others when you really feel for them. Like life, nothing caught in a social web is simple. As the novel progresses, so does the insight into their emotional well-being, which reaches a climax of sorts when Connell is having suicidal thoughts and Marianne feels insignificant in the world. Luckily, Rooney handles these topics with grace that captures the feelings of depression without glorifying them or using them merely as a plot device. Similarly is Marianne’s homelife, with a now-dead abusive father, an all-but-absent mother and a weak yet abusive older brother who takes out his anger on her. The way these elements shape a person is done quite well--aside from some of Rooney’s presentation of sexual dominance to be discussed shortly--and the impact that people have on each other’s growth and identity is shown as both a sadness and a joy throughout the novel. ‘That’s money, the substance that makes the world real. There’s something so corrupt and sexy about it.’  It is easy to get invested in the non-relationship of Marianne and Connell, which really pulls the novel forward through authentic raw emotion, but what really makes the novel work is the ways their relationship, and sex, becomes an avenue to examine power dynamics. What is particularly interesting about Marianne and Connell are their particular social classes and how these shape the way they interact with their world.
He and Marianne never talked about money. They had never talked, for example, about the fact that her mother paid his mother money to scrub their floors and hang their laundry, or about the fact that this money circulated indirectly to Connell, who spent it, as often as not, on Marianne.
While the two rarely discuss money, the influences of late capitalism are very much a part of their identities. Marianne stays on in Dublin and never has to work whereas Connell spends his weekends back home working in a garage and he is looked down upon at Trinity by his peers due to his working class status. It even causes a “breakup” between him and Marianne after their first year when his pride in not asking her to stay at her place since he cannot afford rent is seen by her as him wanting to go home to see other people and disguising it as not having the money to stay in Dublin for the summer. To her the idea of simply not being able to pay rent seems like an aberration from reality. When they are both awarded a scholarship, Connell is irked that for him it is a necessity to fund school but for Marianne it is just a status symbol (and her being awarded the money means a student who actually needed it was denied the money). It is then pointed out to Connell that he is accepting being served dinner at the award ceremony by his own working class peers, essentially throwing guilt back at him as a working-class traitor. This is a typical knee-jerk reaction of a dominant class, repositioning guilt to create in-fighting within the subordinate classes as the dominant class continues on unimpeded.	Guilt manifests itself in many ways throughout the novel. Self-doubt and shame enter into many of the characters in the later portion of the novel and there is even a suicide of a character Connell remembers most as someone who built their personality out of trying to be accepted by others. The social posturing and societal guilt that drives it becomes toxic at a point. Most pronounced is Marianne’s self-guilt and the ways her history of trauma still keeps her in it’s grasp:
Denise decided a long time ago that it is acceptable for men to use aggression towards Marianne as a way of expressing themselves. As a child, Marianne resisted, but now she simply detaches, as if it isn't of any interest to her, which in a way it isn't. Denise considers this a symptom of her daughter's frigid and unlovable personality. She believes Marianne lacks 'warmth', by which she means the ability to beg for love from people who hate her.
Central to the novel are the sexual growth and identities of Marianne, which Rooney has pegged as a deviant, and Connell who is motivated by privacy, shame and supposed normalcy. Connell views sex as a very private act--he is very flustered when Peggy suggests a threesome with Marianne and Connell--and forces his and Marianne’s relationship to be secret in fear of other’s thinking him abnormal for being with her. He is bothered by her desires for submission and thinks of himself as better than being able to go along with them. As sex is often a metaphor for capitalism in the book, Connell is attempting to be “ethical”, but it is also an issue that he consistently views her prior history and sexuality as constituting abnormality and being “damaged” (as he often puts it). There is a sense of the classic Catholic guilt at play and his revulsion towards her wishes to be hit puts a wedge between them. ‘Is the world such an evil place, that love should be indistinguishable from the basest and most abusive forms of violence?’	Marianne, as mentioned earlier, tends towards a more devil-may-care attitude towards sex and has a preference for being abused. A major criticism of the book are the ways that submissive preference and being damaged are overly entangled. Using sex as a critique of capitalism, the submissive behavior and those who eagerly dominate over her is an insightful examination of power dynamics, but I do concede the argument that it minimizes the possibility of an aggressive sexual relationship founded on love and mutual understanding instead of only being an avenue for abuse and actual sadists like all the examples in the novel. Moving on. Under capitalism, the female body is inevitably commodified and her dominators tend to see her more as an object to control rather than an equal partner. Her boyfriends are all abusers of power: the first is hosting a fascist to speak on campus, the second is the son of a banker central to causing the economic collapse in Ireland (he also tells stories about his friends working in the US banking industry as if the housing bubble collapse is funny anecdote), and the third is an artist who enjoys photographing torture. It is best stated when the Swedish artist coerces Marianne into being tied up more, ignoring her pleas to stop by telling her he knows she’ll do it because she loves him and he loves her. She wonders ‘Could he really do the gruesome things he does to her and believe at the same time he’s acting out of love?’The need to possess her and abuse her is mirrored in the social class aspects of the novel. While the likely-sociopathic Jamie does not physically abuse her outside of bed, his emotional abuse is far worse--much like the way the wealthy class gaslights the lower classes into remaining submissive. Unfortunately, Rooney’s answer to the sexual questions raised by the book are a bit of a let-down compromise that gives masculinity unnecessary applause. At two pivotal moments in the book, Connell stands up to an abuser--one in high school when she is groped and the other at the end when her nose has been broken--by swooping in through a display of being more masculine than the abuser. It feels overly traditional, much like the sexual roles, in a novel that would be better served by pushing limits. The sexual compromise of the two at the end, with Marianne basically submitting to his love and masculinity, feels like a cop-out for an ending that is already far too tidy than it need be. 	Despite this, the novel registers as a success overall. Rooney leaves the novel on a note of uncertainty, a similar tone that fueled the infectious nature of the novel, which makes up for the overly tidy emotional climax and resolution. It seems inevitable that there will be a miniseries of this with Ed Sheeran's Castles on the Hill blasting over a montage of Connell and Marianne--this idea almost makes me want to drop a star, though I won't--and while this work is imperfect it achieves what it sets out to do and I very much enjoyed reading it. I couldn't put it down to be honest. These characters are easy to care for, the story is engrossing and the undercurrents of themes and social criticisms are well executed. This novel is a serious dose of early romance nostalgia that doesn’t sugar coat anything. The imperfections and complexities of love and identity are what makes this novel function at its best and I will be eagerly awaiting her next book. 4.5/5Her eyes fill up with tears again and she closes them. Even in memory she will find this moment unbearably intense, and she's aware of this now, while it's happening. She has never believed herself fit to be loved by any person. But now she has a new life, of which this is the first moment, and even after many years have passed she will still think: Yes, that was it, the beginning of my life."

Ms. Rooney this could have had a really cool short story or a novella perhaps but I felt like a masochist wanting to finish this and I did...and I am glad it's finito. Please do not write a sequel because you will likely take up nominations that other books shouldhave gotten. No matter how many people urge me to read the sequel I will decline and wish the best for both Connell and Marianne. Off with ya both !! "

While the writing was really beautiful in parts, I struggled to understand Marianne, who seemed to be both ugly and beautiful, popular and friendless. And the whole submissive thing seemed badly drawn, as was her apparent eating disorder. The on-off relationship also became deeply frustrating after the third or fourth separation. Ironically, given the title of the book, there was nothing normal about the main characters' complete inability to converse with one another at the absolutely pivotal moments of their relationship."

Uncomfortable and ProvocativeIn Normal People, Sally Rooney tells the story of two deeply damaged people who develop an intense relationship that transcends the norms. 
Connell and Marianne start a secret romantic relationship while in high school. Connell is the popular jock who secretly cares what everyone thinks about him. Marianne is the school pariah--the girl who people create myths about. While they both feel alone and misunderstood, together they understand not only one another, but also themselves. When they start University, their roles reverse. No longer forced to keep their relationship a secret, they have other barriers to face--many which are dark and daunting. Both begin to spiral. It is only when they are together that they can face themselves and the world around them.Normal People could have been a whiny, angsty read about two very self-absorbed 18-to twenty-somethings, but the narrative structure and Rooney's writing elevates the characters and story to another level. The narrative is told through the inner workings of Connell and Marianne’s minds. The reader is privy to their issues and disturbing thoughts. They are awkward and flawed characters, which made them feel very real. I was hoping for more growth, but the glimpse of hope at the end helped me realize that Connell and Marianne were ready to face the future. This is a very dark and disturbing read with some light at the end. While I came to care about Connell and Marianne’s characters, I wouldn’t want to read this again! 
“I don’t know why I can’t be like normal people.”

It feels ferociously of the moment, yes, but it also has a timelessness all its own. Cut through the hype - cut through the show. Rooney's time management is stellar (every new chapter is a time jump ahead), both perspectives are great (every chapter alternates between our two leads, with the attendant misunderstandings of a really good rom-com), and the characters behave like real humans. Excellent supporting cast too, which is a rare treat. There are issues, sure, but this is a pleasure machine."

The review I am going to write is all about the writing and how people can be douchebags and mats as normal as life can get. One of those few books in which the writing is as it is, the characters as they are (annoyingly annoying the readers the entire time while reading about them). There's something about the book, the writing and the characters that's so real. Yes, it represents romance like real life bad romance (I doubt if I can call it that), bullying and discrimination, how life changes from school to college to real adulting. Yes, it's not all roses and fluffy clouds. But sometimes too pathetic and desperate. At this point, I want to sing Selena Gomez' The Heart Wants What It Wants 🤦(Well.... ***People: The writing is bad!!! Do you call those proper dialogues??? I cannot make out who was saying what and what's been said by who?Me: I can read English. So I read it. I got used to it by the 2nd page.***People: The characters are so unlikeable. The MCs are pathetic.Me: Just confused people like you and me.***People: There's no plot at all.Me: My Life has no plot at all too. It's just a string of everydays. Like the string of months and years in this book.***People: The story is bizarre.Me: Totally. Just like Murakami's stories.(I would have said the same things if I didn't like the writing!At the end of the day, the good writing always saves the day!)"
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1903072-peter-boyle,Rating 3 out of 5,"I wanted to like this book more than I did. How thrilling that the author hailed as ""Salinger for the Snapchat generation"" is Irish, and from my own province of Connacht at that. There are moments in this novel that would certainly back up such a bold claim. But I believe that she is a writer still honing her craft. Not quite the finished article just yet, but with all the potential to become a literary heavyweight.In the beginning we meet Connell and Marianne, two young people growing up the west of Ireland. Marianne comes from a wealthy family and Connell's mother Lorraine is a cleaner in their lavish house. At the start of the book, the pair are in their final year at school - Connell is a popular sports star while Marianne is a social outcast. They are close despite operating in completely different circles. Roles are reversed once they move to Dublin for college - Marianne falls in with a group who appreciate her wit and intelligence, and a taciturn Connell finds it difficult to make friends. The story follows their on-off relationship over the years - they go from being pals, to more than that, to who knows? They are a huge part of one another's lives, no matter what their romantic status.Rooney is strong on the intricacies of relationships - how the influence of one person can shape another person's whole life, and how little misunderstandings can snowball into major heartbreak. At one point Connell discovers that becoming part of a couple can even validate one's existence: ""To be known as her boyfriend plants him firmly in the social world, establishes him as an acceptable person, someone with a particular status, someone whose conversational silences are thoughtful rather than socially awkward."" She is also extremely perceptive about the journey from adolescence into adulthood, that point in your life where you fly the nest to take on the world and finally meet people with the same interests as yours - confident, excited and apprehensive all at once: ""They were coming into college every day to have heated debates about books they had not read.""However, there were a couple of things that bugged me. For one, Marianne's family despise her, yet we are given no reason for this. The actions of her brother Alan, in particular, become more ridiculous as the story goes on, and without proper context they just feel ludicrous. And I'm afraid I found the dialogue quite flat at times. For two people like Marianne and Connell, who know each other so well, I kept thinking, is this how they would really speak to each other? Their exchanges are so earnest and dry. For example, there's one part where they are about to have sex after missing one other for so long, and the atmosphere is charged. They kiss. Marianne says that she wants this so much, and Connell goes: ""It's really nice to hear you say that. I'm going to switch the TV off, if that's OK."" The description of the scene makes it sound passionate but the conversation dulls its effect.Maybe I'm nitpicking. There were many aspects of the book I really admired. It's just that when I see publications like The Guardian declaring Normal People a ""future classic"", I expect a bit more from it. I do think that Sally Rooney is massively talented, and her gifts of observation and empathy will serve her very well in her career. She may have the literary world at her feet right now, but I reckon her best work is yet to come."

It's not like this with other people, she says. Yeah, he says. I know.
I wanted to love this book but, truth be told, my feelings landed somewhere closer to like. The numerous accolades and glowing reviews this novel received from multiple outlets led me to believe I was destined to adore this awkward tale of first love. And on some level, I did. Yet, part of me feels underwhelmed. Mostly with the storyline arc or lack-thereof, which translated to a frustrating conclusion. My introduction to Sally Rooney’s writing was a bit of a rocky one. For the life of me, I cannot figure out why an author would choose not to surround dialogue with quotation marks. Is this some sort of artsy statement? My distaste stemming from the simple fact that it’s a trying task deciphering if a character sharing a scene with another is speaking their words aloud or running through an internal monologue. There were a lot of stunted moments for me initially when it came to Marianne and Connell’s interactions. Once I found my footing with Rooney's style, I began to see the fascinating direction she was taking things. Namely, with the role reversals. When readers meet Marianne and Connell, two high-school classmates, she's a bit of an outcast, while he's a popular jock. They fall into a friends-with-benefits scenario, and naturally, he wants to keep things hush-hush. Marianne, not recognizing that she deserves better, goes along with the situation. There are underlying feelings there, but an acknowledgment from either, not so much. When the friends cross paths again at college, Marianne has a newfound confidence and a host of friends, while Connell is alone and wallowing in uncertainty. Through these two characters, Rooney examines how relationship dynamics and outlooks on life can shift as circumstances evolve. While readers are privy to their inner thoughts, Marianne and Connell rarely own up to the feelings they have for one another. Each crippled by self-doubt when it comes to voicing their desires for more—an actual relationship. The entire novel is propelled by the deep-seated hurt they each lug around. Hurt that feeds into their miscommunication and impedes their forward progression. And just when you think, yes! It’s finally happening. The maddening cycle starts all over again. I recognize that Rooney took a bit of a risk here, going for something other than the typical happily ever after ending, yet it almost felt like the journey was a throwaway. What was the point of trudging through the muck with Marianne and Connell if they were just going to end up right back where they started?*Thank you to the FCPL for the borrowed copy and all the librarians who ensure we have access to an outstanding selection."
38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,Rating 5 out of 5,"Oooof. Alright - a disclaimer before I start. Normal People by Sally Rooney is superb. I’m gonna gush about this one (warning to those in the splash zone!) and I honestly feel that the less you know about it, the better the experience will be for you. So, to those of you who’re thinking of reading it, don’t bother with any reviews about the book - just read it. It’s a contemporary story about a boy and a girl who fall in love. That’s all you need to know. And when you’re done, come back and we can hi-five each other in joy over its excellence! …Why did I begin with “Oooof”? Because I genuinely feel like I’ve been punched in the gut. Repeatedly. This is such an emotionally exhausting and draining read! Sally Rooney’s created a remarkably compelling pair of characters in Marianne and Connell and I felt their love so intensely it was like I was experiencing it with them. Which makes it sound like a romance, and it has some of those elements, but if it’s anything it’s a classic Bildungsroman (just a fancy word for “coming of age” story). Marianne is the awkward loner in high school, brainy but socially isolated. Connell is the good-looking popular boy, inexplicably drawn to Marianne - star football player falls for nerdy girl. The two begin seeing each other secretly - god, it sounds sooo fucking cheesy doesn’t it? I promise you it’s anything but. From there it’s a rollercoaster of emotions as the characters grow and develop. I loved it pure and simple. Here are some critiques to anyone who didn’t enjoy the book: Marianne’s brother Alan is a laughably one-dimensional villain. There’s no plot (which is very typical of this type of story) - the story just starts and then ends. The occasional phrase feels hammy and clichéd (stuff like “so few people have what we have”). Connell is written as this genius but he does some super-dumb things - and if he is so brilliant, would he care so much what others thought of him? Also, given how unbelievably connected Connell and Marianne are on every conceivable level, the number of times they misunderstand one another seemingly purely for dramatic purposes could be seen as contrived as fuuuuck. And, though I know almost nothing about Rooney, it feels like a very autobiographical novel - most young writers tend to write about themselves to start with, after all. She’s a young Irish woman who went to Trinity College, Dublin, on a scholarship, like Marianne, and the novel ends with the characters in their mid-20s, which is the same age I suspect Rooney was when she stopped writing this (she’s now 27 years old). In that regard you could say it’s somewhat unimaginative. Listen: none of that matters. I noticed those things and I didn’t care. Because it’s so well-written, so damn compelling, so enthralling and honest and… real. If I gave this anything less than the highest possible rating, I’d be lying about how much I enjoyed this book. It’s also impressive that she didn’t shy away from writing the sex scenes given how tricky they are to write with most writers publicly embarrassing themselves. She’s such a confident and skilful writer – already, at such a young age! - that she pulls them off admirably and, yes, sensuously. If you’ve ever heard someone trying to convince someone else to start reading books, one of the points they’ll make is that you get to live lives you never would. Most books do this on a superficial level but Normal People actually achieves this viscerally. This is one of those books that effortlessly draws you into it and lets you experience the intensity of Marianne and Connell’s heart-achingly, tender, complex relationship in a totally believable way - it’s powerful stuff. Truly, I felt more and more anxious as the book went on until I was actually dreading the end - this novel turned me into a wreck! The Guardian review, which drew me to this book in the first place, mentioned something like “this is a novel for and about the Millennial generation” but it’s not really. In a literal sense the characters and author are Millennials but besides that there’s nothing about this book that makes it distinct for this specific time - it could easily be set at any point in the last 50 years and still work perfectly. I’m not really sure what the book was trying to say - if anything - but it’s left a deep impression regardless. Maybe that’s it - the whole labelling of generations is a fruitless exercise in misnomers, we’re all the same and love is a complicated, weird thing for all of us? Maybe it’s trying to define what “normal” is for this generation but isn’t that something every generation goes through? And I’m not exactly sure what conclusions Rooney comes up with could be uniquely ascribed to Millennials. I’ll leave it with this because I’m spent: Normal People isn’t just the best novel of the year, or even the best novel of the last few years, but it’s one of the best I’ve ever read in my life. Maybe I’m just a sucker for coming of age stories? W. Somerset Maugham’s Of Human Bondage told a similar type of story that left me just as devastated - but in a good way (sort of). A beautiful powerhouse of quiet, extraordinarily potent sensations that indelibly captures an important part of the human experience, Normal People has made me an instant fan of Sally Rooney’s - and thank you for writing it.

39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80238438-ri,Rating 1 out of 5,"Normal People had everything except Normal People. If this is one of the best romance books and Connell and Marianne are the definition of soulmates, then maybe I don't need any romance or soulmate in my life. I'm fine with staying single than have what they had. This book was so boring and nonsense and left me feeling miserable, irritable and angry. I'm left astonished to see that this book is viewed as a real, heartfelt and deeply moving love story instead of a problematic and toxic one. How can one ignore the humiliation, abuse and ambivalence and think of it as something romantic. And please don't tell me that they are flawed and unlikeable characters who makes mistakes over and over again because they are humans and blah blah blah. I know how flawed Connell and Marianne were and I would've been okay with them had they atleast tried to redeem some of their negative traits. But they didn't and made everything and everyone around them miserable with their insufferable personalities. Character development what? Sally only knows how to write her characters as Normal People.I knew I would never like this book because I watched the show months ago and it took me weeks to finish it, even though I was watching it at 2x speed lol. And surprisingly I listened to the audiobook of this book at 1.60x speed. I just wanted to be done with this book. It's not that I don't love reading books like this with flawed, real and imperfect characters. I do love reading about characters with those personality traits. But Marianne and Connell were not just flawed and imperfect. They were both stupid, toxic, boring, immature, childish, pathetic, infuriating, insufferable and annoying. I wanted to like this book but I just couldn't. And the disturbing and trashy things Connell thought and said in this book were enough for me to kill punch him in the face. The way he thought about fucking some girl who looks weird because she might be a bisexual was such a disturbing and homophobic shit I've ever read.
“He could fuck some weird-looking girls who turn out to be bisexual.”
I can't believe Sally actually wrote this in her book.Both the characters were highly intelligent yet they both were incapable of communication. They just can't talk about their issues or their feelings and I was tired of hearing them say, ""No one else feels like you do"", ""I wanted you to kiss me"", ""I love you"", ""Can we have sex"". Can they just shut the fuck up and actually talk about how they feel. And don't get me started with how Connell treated Marianne in school because he was embarrassed by her. She was a weird loner girl in school so yeah nobody talked to her and then suddenly Connell and Marianne started sleeping together and he told her to never talk to him in school and don't tell about their so called arrangement in school.CONNELL IS THE BIGGEST RED FLAG OF THE CENTURY. He is the worst character in this book. When his friends talked shit about Marianne he never took her side. He never stopped them he was just like ""hey don't talk about her like that"".  And when one time one of his friend physically abused her and groped her, he just stood there. He didn't tried to do anything. Well actually none of Marianne's friend did anything about it and the whole scene happened in public. Neither did Marianne tried to stand up for herself. I'm so sick of FMCs like her that does nothing for themselves. I get you felt abused and you didn't knew what to do at that moment but not saying anything and just fleeing won't do you any good lady. You know when Connell tried to take her side? When she exited the party and he was like ""hey are you okay"", ""let me take you home"" and then he asked her who was just physically abused by some guy minutes ago that does she wants to come to his house for a while because his mother might not be home. Are you actually kidding me? She was abused and instead of just being there for her he was trying to invite her to his house to have sex. Is this how things work in real life because I sure as hell never heard and saw anything like that. And they call this book a real and relatable story. Yeah, sure.The nonstop back and forth and nonstop sorrys and regrets and I know but I love yous were so annoying and irritable. Marianne trying to degrade herself because she felt unworthy was just the most nonsensical thing I've ever read about. There is thing called THERAPY girl. Maybe you should try it sometime. I might have some sympathy for Marianne for what she had to go through and how her family treated her but she never tried to actually do something for herself. Not even in the end. Who's gonna take your side when you don't even want to take your own side? All the characters in this book need therapy. Their relationship felt purely physical and insta loving. No chemistry. No emotional connection. Nothing. I don't even understand why they loved each other? It would be so much better if they never reconnected again in college. Marianne was the biggest delulu ever because she thought Connell wanted her for something more other than his pathetic experiment of using her for sex. He pitied her and thought it was love. How did Marianne never saw this? Take out the sex scenes and you've got no plot. They never tried dating because they believed hookup culture will solve all their problems. 
“I'm not a religious person but I do sometimes think God made you for me.”
No he didn't Connell, you just deluded yourself into believing this like you did when you told Marianne you loved her. The characters weren't the only thing I hated in this book. The writing was mediocre and monotonous. I don't understand why there were so many time jumps and it was hard for me to stay concentrated because one time they were in present and the next they were talking about something that happened months ago but in present timeline. I know this book was supposed to be a complelling and intimate exploration of the intricacies of human relationships and friendships and the way some external forces like class, upbringing and social norms can shape individual choices and self-perception. But this book ended up being the biggest disappointment. I understand the message Sally was trying to convey with this book but the execution of the plot mafe everything about this book nonsensical. The ending was surprisingly the best part of this book. But honestly is it even worth it? I mean surely they can date other people when they are apart and they will, but they will always try to come back to each other which would only destroy more lives in future. And I don't understand why everyone is crying over that ending. Yeah, they didn't ended up together but there is a short story in which they are 23 years old and single and you know what's gonna happen now? They will want to have a miserable only sex relationship and will never communicate their feelings with each other. And that's how my friend ""They fucked, lived and died miserable happily ever after"".I have so many things to say but I think that's enough of my ramblings. If you ever see me pick up another book similar to this, for the love of god stop me because I don't think I can survive Normal People 2.0.—————————————————————————Romance? This book is straight up horror.I don't know how but somehow I survived this.Review rant soon 🫢—————————————————————————I might be the only person in this world who hated the show 😗 and i still wanna know what all this hype is about even though i know im gonna end up hating book also"

This book tore my heart out and stomped on it, and I mean that in the best possible way.Marianne and Connell become acquainted when his mother is the housekeeper for her family. Marianne’s family is wealthy, but she is the smart, nerdy, unattractive girl who is an outcast at school while Connell, also smart, is the popular jock. They enter into a relationship that he wants to keep secret. Marianne doesn’t feel as if she deserves anything more than this and so accepts these terms. The relationship has its ups and downs and neither can communicate well with the other. Circumstances occur that drive them apart but their paths cross in college and they find their positions are reversed. Marianne is now the sophisticated, popular girl while Connell’s lower socioeconomic status makes him feel unworthy. He is now the unpopular one who is the outsider.In the ensuing years, they drift in and out of each other’s lives. As the reader, we are privy to their innermost thoughts and desires, their longings and their pain. We know their sensitivities, and what makes them tick. We learn details of their backgrounds and the resulting pain and hurt.  Sometimes the damage and the pain is just too deep to reveal oneself to another. It’s better to bury it and deny it, to pretend to not care as a defense mechanism. The truth is they care very much, but they don’t feel deserving of love and kindness. Such a person often turns to unhealthy ways of managing their pain. When I discovered one of Marianne’s coping mechanisms it was devastating.“Deep down she knows she is a bad personality, corrupted, wrong, and all her efforts to be right, to have the right opinions, to say the right things, these efforts only disguise what is buried inside her, the evil part of herself.”On seeing two friends happy together… “It gives Marianne a window into real happiness, though a window she cannot open herself or ever climb through.”I loved the way the author portrayed these characters as so very flawed, but gave us the information we needed to understand them. There’s so much pain in their young lives that it made my heart hurt.Connell’s is just as broken:“he had just wanted to be normal, to conceal the parts of himself that he found shameful and confusing.”“…internally he felt nothing. He was like a freezer item that had thawed too quickly on the outside and was melting everywhere, while the inside was still frozen solid.”Can these two people ever find happiness? Not just with each other, but with life in general. My heart broke, then grew hopeful, and then broke again. I read the majority of this novel in one sitting. I could not tear myself away. The writing is gorgeous and I’m in awe that someone so young has such insight into the human heart and can write in a way that delivers such an emotional punch.It’s no secret that books that delve deep into a character’s psyche are my favorite types of reads. They deliver all the emotions that makes for an unforgettable read. People who walk around with invisible scars that make them feel unworthy and ‘less than’ touch me deeply. The ending…I don’t see how it could have ended any other way. It isn’t tied up in a neat bow but gives the reader much to ponder.Note there are no quotation marks which I usually find annoying and gimmicky, but in this case it worked and worked well. After a few pages I didn’t even notice.Marialyce and I read and discussed this together. It’s a book that begs to be discussed the minute you turn the last page.Many thanks to Netgalley for my copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.

She's the big, ""it"" thing in the book world, and I'm only now seeing what she's all about. This is what happens when you spend your time obsessing over people like John Updike (again, SO late to the party, but in my defence, I wasn't born when much of his partying was going on).So, Sally Rooney. Well, I can see why she's got a lot of readers. I gobbled this up really quickly, in probably two days. It's a fast read because it's written reasonably well, but also because it's compelling (at least, in the beginning). It chronicles the relationship between a young Irish couple, Marianne and Connell. Their relationship is on/off, they're in/out of bed, they're good/bad at communication. Normal People strikes me as something of a guilty pleasure - it's got the bird's eye view into this couple's boudoir with all the pleasures of a more commercial fiction, but it's got a higher quality of prose and psychological insight, which makes it more literary.Why two stars, then? My regard for Rooney's novel degraded as it went on, mainly through repetition. While I was engaged initially, that wore off as I progressed through the book. The same thing happens over and over again, right up until the end: the couple is happy, gloriously so, they suffer a silly miscommunication, they don't speak for months. They see each other again after much anguish, and realize they are better together. Rinse and repeat.Do you know a couple like this? The on-off couple? They are SO tiresome, aren't they, so full of their own drama. After the 2nd on-off, people don't want to hear about it any more. Uh oh, there's 200 pages left....The structure of the book is similarly repetitive. A chapter titled ""6 months later"" starts off in medias res, so the reader doesn't know how they got there. After a page or two, Rooney helpfully goes back in time to fill in the gap, and then moves forward again to carry on with the scene. This happens without fail, all through the book, so much so that it's predictable and rhythmic, like a blues song.I usually like the blues, but by the end of this book, I'd stopped caring (or believing) in these characters. They fail to learn anything, which makes their self-obsession wearying to follow. Not even the frequent sex scenes peaked my interest. Perhaps Rooney has captured the narcissism of young adulthood, particularly of a certain generation, but I don't think it's something I want to read about. This is why I don't go to parties."

A volte leggi un libro come Circe e capisci perché e’ piaciuto a cosi tanta gente. Altre volte leggi un libro come 1984 e quasi ti vergogni a dire che non ti e’ piaciuto. Che ti ha annoiato, che ti eri fatto troppe aspettative. Mica puoi dire che potevi farne a meno, per cui ci pensi e ci ripensi. Che magari sei tu a non averci capito un cazzo, a non aver carpito il senso, per cui sta zitto che ci fai una figura migliore. Quasi come se uno dovesse vergognarsi di quello che gli piace e quello che non gli piace.Pensa un po’ come siamo ridotti nel 2020.Normal People parla di due ragazzi e dovrebbe essere una specie di storia d’amore. Dico “dovrebbe” e “specie” perché non si capisce. Lui la tromba ma non la vuole. Lei lo vuole e vuole solo lui. Quindi si fidanza con un altro.Poi soft bdsm a caso e lei ne soffre. Poi lei cresce e vuole ancora lui, pero’ mentre lui non c’e’ lei gli dice chiaramente che trombera’ con altri. Mi state seguendo?Poi ancora soft bdsm a caso e lei ne soffre.Poi stanno insieme ma non stanno insieme, e si lasciano ma non si lasciano davvero perché mica stavano insieme davvero. Poi lei si fidanza con un altro ma indovinate, vuole sempre lui. Poi loro trombano e lei giustamente le chiede di prenderla a schiaffi. Lui non lo fa e lei ovviamente ne soffre.E nonostante io sappia da tempo di non aver fatto il classico, proprio non ci riesco. Non tanto la storia, oh quella la capisco bene. Chi non ha mai incontrato una tipa un po' stramba come Marianne. Chi non si è mai fatta spezzare il cuore andando a letto con uno come Connell. Quello che non capisco è che bisogno c’era di raccontare la storia di quelli che alla fine sono solo due big weirdo senza nessuna profondita’. La storia e’ e rimane piatta fino alla fine, i due protagonisti crescono in maniera anagrafica ma rimangono gli stessi inetti dell’inizio del libro. La narrazione viene fatta tramite capitoli che sono separati cronologicamente spesso da molti mesi l'uno dall'altro (cosa che ho apprezzato) ma che comunque non è sufficiente, perché non serve a niente, se non a giustificare come la storia passi dall'essere ambientata dal liceo all'università. E no, buttare un paio di frasi nel finale per dare l’idea che le cose siano diverse dall'inizio non mi sta bene. Sally, senti a me. Abbiamo la stessa età, probabilmente abbiamo avuto una adolescenza difficile entrambi, ma certe storie semplicemente non meritano di essere raccontate. Ah, il tutto ovviamente ""secondo me"".Peace Off."

Ma Sally Rooney, non ancora trentenne, riesce dove altri hanno fallito: pur se non esente da sbavature e anche qualche passo falso, io m’inchino.Pagine di dialoghi fitti che s’intrecciano alle descrizioni, la punteggiatura aiuta il mélange, mancano virgolette e trattini che di solito indicano frasi di dialogo: la sensazione che predomina è proprio quella di un lungo ininterrotto scambio verbale e fisico tra Marianne e Connell, un “parlato” lungo duecentoquaranta pagine.Lasciando Castlebar.Marianne e Connell vengono dalla provincia, un paesino nel nord ovest dell’Irlanda. Lei è ricca e ha pessimi rapporti familiari con madre e fratello – il padre non c’è, se n’è andato, poi morirà, sembra che picchiasse moglie e figlia. È molto brava a scuola, ma considerata strana, instabile, da evitare: i compagni di classe la deridono e bullizzano.Solo Connell, non lo fa. All’opposto lui è invece popolare, centravanti della squadra di calcio, atletico, bello, alto forte e delicato. Ma è timido, anche lui non particolarmente sicuro. Figlio di una donna delle pulizie che lavora in casa di Marianne e che l’ha partorito quando era un’adolescente. La differenza economica e di classe non è taciuta, anche se i due giovani protagonisti tra loro non la affrontano mai.Sligo, con i suoi ventimila abitanti è il centro più grosso vicino a Carriklea.Quando vanno all’università, al mitico Trinity College di Dublino, lo stesso di Joyce, le cose s’invertono: lei diventa popolare, apprezzata, accolta, ancora più che accettata. Lei fiorisce, sembra sentirsi sicura, diventa perfino più bella e sexy.Non per Connell che l’ha sempre trovata bella. A lui invece la capitale irlandese riserva isolamento, solitudine, difficoltà di inserimento e socializzazione: Connell ha anche bisogno di lavorare per mantenersi agli studi, e qui la sua classe sociale pesa eccome.Sally Rooney divide il racconto in capitoli introdotti dalla data, che segue o anticipa di qualche mese, più raramente solo qualche settimana. Nonostante la scansione temporale proceda in avanti, la narrazione fa ampio uso del flashback.Inutile dire che non c’è nulla di normale in Connell e Marianne: ed è altrettanto inutile aggiungere che naturalmente sono due giovani perfettamente normali. Depressioni e pensieri suicidi inclusi.Trinity College, Dublino. Marianne e Connell si dicono ti amo, anch’io, lo sai che ti amo, ma poi hanno difficoltà a vivere il loro amore, si prendono e si lasciano. Ogni volta che sembrano sul punto di avvicinarsi a quel momento, al dirsi o decidere di stare davvero “insieme”, qualcosa li ferma e li blocca. Continuando a cercarsi, a rincontrarsi, a restare amici, il migliore amico l’uno per l’altra. Ma impegnarsi in un rapporto di coppia, più o meno stabile, riesce loro solo per brevi tratti della vita. Vivere un sentimento fino in fondo è arduo come scalare la montagna più alta del mondo.Il sesso tra loro funziona a meraviglia, ma lo tengono a freno, perché pensano che vorrebbe dire impegnarsi in qualcosa di duraturo. E per quanto siano amici e parlino, le parole sembrano invece più difficili del sesso. O forse si tratta di una vita interiore che non include l’altro.Né ragione né sentimento, soprattutto emozioni. E ansia. In questi figli del terzo millennio.Ed ecco Connell e Marianne: lui è Paul Mescal e lei è Daisy Edgar-Jones nella serie BBC e Hulu in 12 episodi diretta da Lenny Abrahamson e Hettie Macdonald. Abrahamson ha diretto tra gli altri il buon film “Frank” e il premio Oscar “Room”.La prima volta che hanno fatto sesso, Marianne si è fermata a dormire a casa sua. Lui non era mai stato con una ragazza vergine, prima. In totale aveva fatto sesso solo poche volte e sempre con ragazze che poi andavano a raccontarlo a tutta la scuola. Gli toccava sentirsi ripetere i propri exploit negli spogliatoi: gli errori, e molto peggio, gli strazianti tentativi di tenerezza, ingigantiti da una pantomima. Con Marianne era diverso perché tutto restava tra loro, anche le cose imbarazzanti o difficili. Con lei poteva dire o fare quello che voleva e mai nessuno l’avrebbe scoperto. Il solo pensiero gli dava un inebriante senso di vertigine. Quella notte quando l’aveva toccata era così bagnata; aveva stralunato gli occhi e detto: dio, sì. E aveva potuto dirlo tranquillamente, nessuno l’avrebbe saputo. Al che lui aveva paura di venire solo toccandola così.Sulla copertina dell’edizione inglese."

“life is the thing you bring with you inside your own head.”

full review here: https://postcardsbyelle.substack.com/...if you know anything about me, it is that i could very possibly eat sally rooney books for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and still want more for dessert.normal people was my first read of hers back in 2019. i remember texting my friends who had already read it, saying, “i have no idea how to rate it”. because reading it was such a humanizing experience and i had no idea how to feel. the book, centered around marianne and connell and their lives from adolescence to adulthood, is wrought with misunderstanding after misunderstanding. they struggle together, they struggle apart. while this is not my favorite of hers and the only one i rated 4 stars, rooney’s signature sharp prose and acuity in examining human relationships are abundantly evident in this book. like her other books, normal people is not a romance, but it is a character study that has a love story as its scaffolding. unlike her other two novels, however, normal people is insular to marianne and connell, hyper-focused on the examination into their characters and relationship. she is the only author who can be simultaneously profound and clinically detached in her writing at the same time and still make it feel like magic.the two main characters have nothing in common from the start. marianne is an outcast in school and from a wealthy family. connell is one of the most popular boys in their grade from a working class background. their paths had never really crossed before they talked; they were acquaintances at best. this made the connection that they had even more jarring, because they created their own little world. they shine the best when they are with each other.while they attempt to find happiness and their own place in the world when they’re apart (what it means to be ‘normal people), they are two poles of a magnet when they are together. i’m careful not to romanticize their relationship, but there is something that feels electric about them. at one point, connell tells marianne, “i’m not a religious person but i do sometimes think god made you for me”, and i think that’s exactly how i would describe them.what i actually enjoyed (that many people didn’t) was how rudimentary the side characters and side plots felt. i liked that side characters felt two dimensional and had no real significance to the plot. it got rid of any potential drama or conflict that wouldn’t have amounted to anything at the end apart from it being plot fillers.in the same vein, i know there are a lot of mixed reviews about the very open ending, but it was one of the things i loved most about this book. making it an open ending marks a fresh start for marianne and connell, hopefully free of miscommunication and full of possibilities."
49,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66513638-gtf,Rating 2 out of 5,"There's a couple of aspects of this book that I think are either weak or flawed. I'll start with the characterization. Firstly, the character of Marianne needs to be addressed - Marianne, who is either very good-looking or unattractive, given the page. The reader is introduced to her as a lonely, eccentric outcast, yet from the beginning she seems to interact relatively fine with her peers, and doesn't really exhibit any discernible eccentricities that would stem from having unique or dark perceptions of the world we are living in. Marianne is really just slapped with the label of a loner without the author getting deep into the complexities of her social isolation. However, she attends university after completing secondary school and suddenly has a core group of friends along with a string of boyfriends and acquaintances. This was a very absurd turn for someone who the author was writing to be incompatible with friendships and relationships. Secondly, the other protagonist, Connell, is a little more consistent than Marianne, but like Marianne he fails to strike on any level of thought and emotion. Connell is the most intelligent, popular, good-looking, friendly sports star in the school, but mentioned in the novel is that Connell comes from a troubled, anti-social background. It seems very unlikely for him to possess that much potential when he comes from a gene pool of poor functioning. Although Rooney wrote him to be reasonably compassionate given that doesn't exhibit toxic masculinity per se, there is still no real personality evident with any of the characters. They are being carried through the novel by buzz words associated with Irish young people: leaving cert, six hundred points, Trinity College, pre-drinking, debs etc. in the hopes that mentioning these things makes them feel more real. Lastly, Marianne's brother Alan - whom she appears to have a relatively normal sibling relationship with for most of the novel - suddenly turns physically abusive towards her as the novel nears its end. Again, the author doesn't delve deeply into the reasons for Alan's abusive behaviour, other than saying that Marianne's late father was physically aggressive towards her and her mother. Alan's abusive streak is very unconvincing due its sudden, contrived presence. Simplicity seems to be a common word that people are using to describe the writing of this novel. The writing has simplicity, yes, but to the point where it is so simple that it is often inadequate. The writing is really lacking in description, imagery, poetry, and imagination. There needs to be a more thought-provoking and aesthetic narrative to compensate for the lack of development in the plot. Although, Rooney wrote a very interesting section on Marianne's fear that art could be pointless, given that it has a more intellectual existence than an emotional one. The plot was very repetitive. For the most part, it is Connell and Marianne having very intimate moments together, followed by the two of them balking at the opportunity of being in a relationship together. This book is very similar to David Nicholls' hit novel 'One Day': a young man and a young woman who are more than just friends, but really lack the confidence to be in a serious relationship together. It seems like Rooney was striving for 'Normal People' to be like 'One day' to the point where the former is a rip-off of the latter."

51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel,Rating 5 out of 5,"Engrossing, complex, and emotionally honest, Normal People is an understated powerhouse of a novel. As this book ends up being so much more than the sum of its parts it's particularly difficult to summarize, but basically, it's a sort-of-love-story about Connell and Marianne, two young people growing up in small town Ireland together, who both move to Dublin for university in 2011.There isn't much going on in this book aside from Connell and Marianne's 'will they/won't they' relationship, but I wouldn't describe this as a romance novel as much as a novel about being human. Sally Rooney highlights with razor-sharp precision the oddities and intricacies that complicate interpersonal interactions, even between two people who love one another. This book is about miscommunication, but not miscommunication as a plot device; miscommunication as an intrinsic part of the human experience, naturally calling into question the possibility of truly knowing another person. Connell and Marianne's inability to open up to one another is so much bigger than these two individual characters; it's about gender roles and socioeconomic differences and power dynamics and social status and preconceived notions and projections and misinterpretations, and Rooney examines it all minutely through the lens of this one ill-fated sort-of-couple. She also has the uncanny ability to cut to the emotional core of a scene without sensationalizing, and I think that's what strikes me as the most accomplished element of this novel.I think this book is inevitably going to be underestimated by some because of its premise, and because of all the hyperbolic claims that Rooney is the definitive voice of her generation. But it's a deceptively clever book; it's perceptive where it could easily be vapid, it's clear-eyed where it could be melodramatic, and it has more intellectual and emotional depth than anything else I've read recently. A bit of an unconventional choice for the Booker longlist, but it fully earned its spot in my opinion, and I'd love to see it shortlisted."

Normal People
 almost felt like a puzzle, in that you didn't really know what you were truly getting until all of the pieces came together. Beautifully written although a little slow in its pacing, it's a novel full of deep emotions, which made it difficult to read at times.Connell and Marianne know each other from high school, although they pretend not to, plus his mother works as a cleaner for her family. Marianne is a bit of a laughing stock in school, mainly because she doesn't care what her classmates think of her. Connell is tremendously affected by what people think of him, so when a connection starts to grow between him and Marianne, and turns to something physical and even emotional, they keep it hidden, and he ignores her in school.""At times he has the sensation that he and Marianne are like figure-skaters, improvising their discussions so adeptly and in such perfect synchronisation that it surprises them both. She tosses herself gracefully into the air, and each time, without knowing how he's going to do it, he catches her.""Marianne feels so intensely for Connell, and she is willing to let him possess her completely. He can't explain his feelings for Marianne, except that she thinks so highly of him, but he continues to fear what his peers would think if they knew what was going on. He winds up treating her badly, leaving her to deal with her own emotional distress.One year later, both are studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Connell feels uneasy, no longer the popular fellow he was in high school, and has difficulty relating to his peers and fitting in. Marianne, on the other hand, is comfortable in this world, enjoying deep conversations about the political and economic issues facing society, and being looked at as an object of desire, not ridicule by her fellow students. No matter what other opportunities present themselves, the pair finds themselves drawn to each other once again, enjoying the way their interactions make them feel yet falling into the same patterns which cause friction.""Marianne had a wildness that got into him for a while and made him feel that he was like her, that they had the same unnameable spiritual injury, and that neither of them could ever fit into the world. But he was never damaged like she was. She just made him feel that way.""
Normal People
 follows Marianne and Connell through their time at college, through different relationships and the periodic circling back to one another, whether solely for friendship or something else. Each chapter, with a few exceptions, takes place a few months after the last one. But Marianne's penchant for self-destruction and Connell's inability to cope with the emotional stresses he faces leave them both unsure what their relationship should be and could be, if anything.Marianne's feeling she is unworthy of being loved without abuse or mistreatment, and the way she is treated by her family, boyfriends, and others, is very difficult to read about at times. Connell's bouts with depression are also quite painful to read, so at times this book felt very heavy, and its pacing seemed to move much slower than I would have liked. And like many books which focus on relationships, at times I wanted to shake both characters to make them say the things they wanted to, to each other and other people in their lives.Despite the book's emotional turmoil, Rooney's writing is exceptional. There were so many passages beyond the two I've cited in this review that I read over and over again, marveling at her use of language and imagery. She definitely got me completely immersed in this book and these characters, even when things seemed particularly draining or moved slowly.

54,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16174645-paula-k,Rating 5 out of 5,"Irish author, Sally Rooney’s second novel came to my attention when nominated for the Booker in 2018. Since then Normal People has won the Costa Book Award, An Post Irish Award, and nominated for many others. Quite a distinction for a wonderfully talented young author.Normal People is about Marianne and Connell, their secret friendship, and their on and off again relationship. They are two young people drawn to each other who drift apart at times, but always end up coming back to each other throughout their lives. It is an intimate, but sometimes painful look at two people from different backgrounds that don’t really belong together. One comes from a loving home, where as the other lives in a cold and hateful environment. Rooney’s novel is powerful and complex. It is not a romance or love story, but an in-depth character driven study. It’s more about obsession and two flawed high school students that follow each other to Trinity College in Dublin. Normal People is unfiltered, emotional and direct. Marianne and Connell do well communicating in bed, but not elsewhere. Misunderstandings from poor communication make this novel what it is - tragic and full of sadness.The ending of the book is perfect. Rooney wraps up her novel as it should be. I am thankful that in my pursuit of reading the Booker Longlist that Normal People was included. Her first book, Conversation With Friends, is waiting on my Kindle...5 out of 5 stars"

Connell too, perhaps. I sat with this novel for a long time before writing this review. The ending unnerved me. It left me unsettled. I thought, what?!

I feel like I can’t put into words why I loved this book - I just did. As someone who went through very similar experiences to the characters, in terms of both school and university, I felt like I was reading about the intertwined lives of two of my close friends.There is something incredibly beautiful in its simplicity. It’s about normal people, people who you feel like you may know, living relatively normal lives. And yet it’s written in a really impactful way. When I wasn’t reading the book, I was thinking about Marianne and Connell and wondering how they were getting on... are they okay?!! *weeps*Without giving anything anyway, I have to come to like the ending after initially being annoyed by it. I feel like it is yet another reflection of how real life just is sometimes - we don’t always grow or progress or move past our issues. More often than not, life isn’t wrapped up in a neat little bow.Normal People is one of those books that I LOVED and yet wouldn’t necessarily recommend it to everyone. If you like the sound of a book that covers topics like mental health, socioeconomic status, and the relationship dynamics between two people who are just destined to be in each other’s lives...then yes, pick this one up!I’m so thrilled that I enjoyed this book so much and that I can really shout about, and support, an Irish author as talented as Rooney. 5 stars!Reread August 2021.

Normal People was often superficial, unoriginal, trivial. I've seen this type of love story before countless times. I've seen thin, pretty, educated, depressed, rich, characters using words like ""Guggenheim"", discussing Lebanon while smoking their fifth cigarette that night. It was nothing new, nothing special. But still there were these moments, insightful and emotional. Certain characters were well-drawn, but (or because?) they didn't get much of the spotlight. The dialogues were pretty decent, too. But overall? I cannot make myself care for another story about people's inability to communicate. I've suffered a severe A-Level trauma from that kind of story and I am over it.

Zdecydowałem się podnieść ocenę i na pewno wkrótce przeczytam ją jeszcze raz. 3.5🌟Mam mały dylemat i sam nie wiem jak ocenić tę książkę. Z jednej strony mi się podobała, a z drugiej nie znalazłem w niej czegoś, co przedstawiłbym jako jej główną zaletę. Rooney porusza tutaj wiele kwestii dotyczących życia młodych ludzi we współczesnym świecie: seks, oczekiwania rodziny, różnice społeczne między kochankami, przemoc w związku. Mamy cały komplet. Największą uwagę zwróciłem na główną bohaterkę, która ma wyraźnie zatarty system wartości i nie wie, czy zasługuje na czyjąś miłość. Jej stan wewnętrzny na przestrzeni mijających lat jest dobrze zobrazowany. Jej doświadczenia budziły we mnie współczucie i nie rozumiałem dlaczego pozwalała na wszystko, co jej się przytrafiało. Marianne, to bohaterka bardzo niedecyzyjna, ale jeżeli ma być adekwatna z tym, co obserwuję wśród nas (młodych ludzi) na co dzień, to na pewno można ją uznać za postać autentyczną. Za to Connell okazywał uległość i zmagał się z niedowartościowaniem, mimo że głęboko w sobie raczej wiedział czego chciał. Doprowadziło to do konsekwencji, które też były jak najbardziej do przewidzenia. Cała opowieść jest jak urywek życia jakichś osób, które sobie żyją, istnieją i niczego bym nie stracił nie przeczytawszy tej książki. Niewiele też zyskałem. Wciąga się ją szybko, ale nie pozostawi we mnie dużego śladu. Czy polecam? I tak i nie. Warto jej dać szansę, ale we mnie zachwytu nie wzbudziła.Update: trochę zmieniłem podejście do tej książki. Od jej skończenia nie daje mi o sobie zapomnieć. Ta książka ma być taka jaka jest. Ten tytuł, brak dialogów (ta forma), ten chłód bijący ze spisanych słów - ta książka jest tak cholernie prawdziwa. Tak wnikająca wgłąb problemu, że człowiek czytając czasem nie jest w stanie go zauważyć, bo bohaterowie unikają o tym rozmowy.

Just seems like the author is being rude to the readers for no reason. Also, I didn’t like either of the main characters and was not rooting for them to get together in the slightest. In fact, I wanted them to never speak to each other again, and I wanted Connell to go die in a ditch. So one big nope from me."

This book is completely introspective and has a heavy dissection into the characters thoughts, feelings, social interactions, miscommunications, awkwardness, sex, uncertainty of themselves and their futures. This book had some very important topics which effect these two characters: suicide; low self-esteem; self loathing/ disgust; domestic abuse; male-peership; poor relationships; mental health (particularly male mental health) and class. This book shows how these two characters seem to be constantly drawn towards each other and how they grow and be comfortable as people when the other is around. How they can open up with each other over certain vulnerabilities that others may not have seen or be privy to. It also shows how their relationship effects other relationships which the characters get into- never quite being able to escape from each other. This book doesn’t shy away from the expressions and emotional states of the characters. It was great to see such vulnerabilities in writing- especially with the “realness” of university- how it is not always an amazing experience; mental-health help at university; jealousies; the difficulties navigating friendship groups and uncertainty over what will happen after uni?. I also enjoyed reading the unsureness and awkwardness of sex and physical contact which is not usually displayed in books (usually some confident description instead) completely humanising these characters.These characters are also deeply smart and interested in politics and books, and I found that these types of conversations also made me love the characters a lot more and added to them. I enjoyed Sally Rooney’s exploration into class issues in Ireland (and universally) and how Connell experiences differently to Marianne as he comes from a working class family. This time I listened to the audiobook and the audiobook narrator was brilliant !! I listened to this during my walks and I was completely transported into the minds of Connell and Marianne. The narrator is Irish so it was great to actually hear the accent of the characters and helped me imagine these characters thoughts and behaviours.Original review:You learn nothing profound about yourself simply by being bullied; but by bullying someone else you learn something you can never forget.This was a hard book to review as it is so outside my usual type of book. This book follows Marianne: intellectual, cold and a wallflower; and Connell: likable, lives in poverty and anxious how people see him. Both have secret family lives outside what their classmates can see; one in a household of love and one from coldness. These two unlikely people become friends and then lovers, navigating their lives in their small rural Irish town to their experiences at college in Dublin. The book journey's their lives from school to university and how these two mismatched young people are inescapable from one another's lives, always drawn to each other.Normal people shows how one person can impact the decisions and actions of anothers life. While I would say the book is simplistic, focusing on the relationship between these two characters, Sally Rooney's narrative of the two character's shows deep vulnerabilities, complexities and unsureness in their thoughts, behaviours and lives. This book documented class issues, mental health issues, relationship issues and explored how two characters are trying to find themselves in today's world. This was all done with reference to today's technology as well and really mirrored a lot of young people's experiences. There was also the frankness of describing sex in the book which was attuned to the character's behaviours and being 'normal people'. Overall this was an easy read and something different from what I usually pick up!"

yes, but they're my banal, mundane, vapid, overly trite mentally ill millennials. all i can think whenever i read a book about two straight white people who agonize over publicizing their relationship status for fear of backlash/judgment/social stigma is you guys wanna be gay sooooo bad it's funny. and that is never more true than in sally rooney's normal people, where one single five minute interaction is enough to blow up a years-long romance, purely because these bitches do! not! know! how! to! communicate! honestly! like you have no excuse!!!!! thinking about connell just sitting dumbly in marianne's living room, then getting up to leave after a simple one sentence misinterpretation.....on god we are gonna enroll you in a COMM 101 class, because what the fuck was that about. i maintain that the angst pushed by this book would cut more deeply if the main couple were gay. the agony, the yearning, the tenderness—! between two straight white people, it's like, okay, you're fucking—NO ONE CARES!connell is that meme that goes men will do shrooms once, unlock the full spectrum of human emotions / realize other people have feelings for the first time, and claim they've achieved nirvana......but with sex. the plot of normal people is literally justconnell: has sex with marianneconnell: she's just so different she is incomparable immutable inscrutable her bone structure is so delicate and pale what i have with her can never be shared with anyone else the feelings she stirs up in me are too potent too singular unlike anything i've ever felt before this is why i can't be with herlike okay john green :/ thousands of other women also wear platform doc martens and read angela davis you're just experiencing emotional vulnerability with the girl you and your trauma have imprinted on for the first time in your life. i want therapy for you two so bad❤️ i can't even act like i wasn't sucked into the theatrical production of their melodrama, because i read this book in one sitting, but i still came out of it like, what the fuck? what the fuck did i just read? and why did i read it? the first half was definitely more buoyant, not quite as (unbearably) pretentious, and felt bolstered by rooney's impeccable ability to nail the minutiae of one-on-one social interactions. anything more complex failed, and that i believe is largely because rooney can't write fully fleshed out characters outside of her main couple.normal people characters who felt glaringly like plot devices + archetypes include:• rachel• peggy• helen• jamie• eric• lukas• alani hate to be the bearer of bechdel tests—kidding...or am i?—but with the female supporting cast, it's a little bit more blatant. there is very little attempt to achieve nuance outside of connell/marianne. rachel, peggy, and helen are nearly indistinguishable in that their defining characteristics are being unlikable on the basis that they hate other women (marianne) out of spite and/or envy. like damn bro! if marianne had more three-dimensional female friends, i think she might have gotten help for her unsafe bdsm complex way quicker than with connell ""trauma bonding is not my problem"" waldron. which is one other thing that left a bad taste in my mouth. the developmental disparity between connell/marianne doesn't really go unnoticed by the narrative itself, which only makes its existence more perplexing. connell is permitted desires, dreams, and interests independent of marianne, while marianne ends the book still nursing her codependency to him, even as she ""waves goodbye."" no i do not consider that sly little ending proof that she has changed in a substantial way (she has not). her arc is literally a 360 skateboard flip, while connell gets to gallivant over to america to live out his kurt vonnegut wet dreams. marianne ends up repeating the same mistakes that helen had, as the girlfriend whose jealousy over The (New) Other Woman connell gets to be annoyed about for just a little longer.i think i could probably enjoy a sally rooney romp with better character/relationship writing, but this just felt like a narrative that wanted to be more complex + thought-provoking than it really was. the existential dread it evoked in me was of the ""wow no human is unique all of our problems ARE boring, cliche adages that we're doomed to hear repeated ad infinitum"" variety, and i don't think that was the intended effect. i also don't think you're supposed to finish a detailed meditation on romantic relationships thinking, ""those two people do NOT love each other at all."" by the end of normal people, i was totally indifferent to the circumstances of the main couple and could not muster up even a drop of empathy for either of them. that, to me, is an unsuccessful novel—even if it was written captivatingly.(omg almost forgot to add: to sally rooney’s editor, PLEASE, FOR MY MENTAL WELLBEING, STOP ALLOWING ALL THOSE COMMA SPLICES TO GO UNCHECKED! ty)"

I’ve been seeing a lot of references to this book and for the life of me I could remember nothing about it. So I re-read my review, which reads to me like a 3-star book. Then I saw I bumped it to 4 stars because I said I would remember it. Well, alas, I don’t, so I am going with 3 stars now. Sorry, Ms. Rooney, but gotta be honest with myself. Back to my original review now:My true rating is somewhere between 2 and 5 stars.Geez, this one made me sad. I don't think it's supposed to make readers sad, but with me it is what it is. If these young people are normal, then God bless everybody. I mean the writing isn't even ""normal."" This is a very talky book, but there is not a quotation mark to be found. It shocked me at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly. But this isn't ""normal"" writing. Does that mean the author isn't quite sure about what ""normal"" means? I'd like to know.Connell and Marianne. We follow them from high school through to several years later as they dance around their relationship. They are seemingly on again and off again, but can never totally escape each other. I alternately loved them and was disgusted by them. I admired Marianne so much for the way she handles a lot of situations, but then off she goes, totally disrespecting herself, which really frustrated me. And Connell. What a sweet guy, until he reveals more of what a jerk he can be. So focused on other people's opinions. What a sad state of affairs and a quintessential example of being one's own worst enemy. And thinking about it, that goes for Marianne too. But they can't help what they think, so it's hard to not like them anyway. I think. I finished this two days ago. I usually write my reviews right away, but I didn't with this one because I couldn't figure out how I felt about it. I still don't, but the review must go on. I didn't always look forward to picking it up as I knew I would probably run into more sad commentary that would just make me want to shake these two. But then I have to admit I had to keep fervently flipping the pages to see what would happen. I had no idea how the author could tie this up at the end. Then she did. Sort of. My reaction? ""Okaaaaaay...""So did I like it? Maybe. Will I remember it for a long time. Oh Yes! And for that it gets more stars than this review would suggest. And the flipping of the pages--that's a reason for stars too. And I read it in a very speedy (for me) three days--that definitely says something.Do I recommend it? It depends. Would I ever read it again? Hmmmm....So there you go. Read it or not. If you do, I will be eagerly awaiting your reaction. If you don't, oh well; but you might have missed a good one. Perhaps."

68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73431206-richard-on-hiatus,Rating 4 out of 5,"Winner of the Costa Book Award and long listed for the Booker Prize, Normal People by Sally Rooney is the story of a modern relationship.Connell and Marianne, both 17, live in a small town in County Sligo, Ireland.Connell is a quiet but popular boy who loves football and literature.Marianne is unpopular, an outcast treated with suspicion and ridicule by her contemporaries. Marianne’s family are rich and live in a big house. Connell’s mother is their cleaner.At first Connell is deeply embarrassed by their fledgling relationship, but this gradually changes as we follow their lives, often in granular detail, from school to university in Dublin.This off and on love affair, full of angst and fraught misunderstanding sees the balance of power shift back and forth. We journey deep into the minds of the central characters and visit some very dark places. Dysfunctional families, abusive relationships, fickle friendships, jealousy and geographical separations all buffet the central couple. Will Marianne and Connell’s relationship win out?Normal People is honest and revealing but can, at times, be tiresome - just imagine you are listening to a self absorbed friend going on and on ...... and on and on ...... about their love life, including loads of awkward, intimate detail you’re not sure you want to hear. You’ll tut, shrug, make sympathetic noises and generally be supportive, but secretly, you’d rather be elsewhere.At times I felt like this, but underneath it all, I did care, I did invest in the couple and grew concerned about their fate. The novel explores the wide range of what is considered normal and is written intelligently and naturalistically. I enjoyed Normal People and do recommend it, but don’t expect a light hearted, feel-good rom com."

70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60866073-baba,Rating 4 out of 5,"The much selling, much loved, much hyped, much TV adaptation success, second novel by Sally Rooney, and this I agree, one of the most outstanding writing talents to emerge for awhile, Sally Rooney. A book much talked about and praised as this, sets pretty high expectations for first time readers such as myself. But I did enjoy this, although I did read it in two spurts, so I couldn't really call it compelling. A modern day relationship story of 'that couple that always get back together' you know the type?The blurb tells the story, or one of the zillion other reviews. I just want to say my little piece, yes it's a great work, very well written, it has an almost genius non-use of speech marks, some clever crafting that puts the featured couple dead centre and plays the supporting characters almost as shadowy archetypes, so many good things! It's still... for me, just another in a long line of American or European middle class writers, with a classic or art background and well-schooled producing literary statements of our times, yes Rooney does it far better than most of her peers, and it works well for her that she's Irish and writes these Dublin based tales... but in the long run, it's a middle class fable written for, and consumed by the middle class? I don't deny it's a great book, I just deny that it is as great as many say, just because it fits so well with middle class Euro-American audiences. 8 out of 12. But yes, if you haven't read it... read it, and be entertained, surprised and beguiled :)2020 read"
71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6351259-michelle,Rating 5 out of 5,"I would give this 10 stars if I could. I probably just finished the best book of 2019.My God, what a book. So many thoughts and emotions are running through my head I don't even know where to begin. I could cry with relief that I had two people really impress upon me the need to read this book. To think! I almost let this go by and fall into the cavern that is my TBR pile. I cannot believe I almost missed out on the experience of what it was like to live with this book the past two days. I was so enthralled that I dreamt about it. My very subconscious absorbing how deeply Marianne and Connell's story touched me to the very core of my heart. Marianne and Connell's friendship begins in her kitchen. Connell comes from a working class, single-parent family whose mother is the housekeeper for Marianne's wealthy mother. While both intellectually gifted, they live in very different worlds. Connell is popular, athletic and the boy every girl wants to be with. Marianne is quiet, socially disinterested and the only talk of her at school is that of how weird she is and how she must be mentally ill. As we pick up later in their lives after a year of college, their roles have reversed. Suddenly Marianne is always with friends and is fending off suitors, while Connell is having a hard time finding his place and fitting in. Their chance encounter at a party leads them to years of on again-off again relations, although what always remains constant is their friendship and love for the other person.What Rooney accomplishes in 273 pages is a complete master class of the spectrum of emotions that are capable in the soul of these two, twenty-somethings. Always having been extremely emotional myself, I felt my heart ripped out of my chest several times through reading this book and then again repaired and replaced as their relationship re-balanced. It was so easy for me to slip back 15 years or so to when I was in college and going through very similar situations. The shy and tentative love that developed was so believeable it set off fireworks inside when that feeling was acknowledged and returned. Then when misunderstanding and miscommunication set off months of depression and loneliness in these characters, that felt so real to me, I thought I was back there myself. Each exquisitely written section jumped ahead just far enough to allow our feelings a reprieve, to only go back and find out what took place in the gap and only have our heart ripped out again. One last piece I want to touch on is something that nagged at me almost peripherally as a subplot to the relationship, which rightly was front and center. That of this really highlighting this generational talent. I've found even as I get older that my experience (in all avenues) that has come with age blinds me to the memory of what it was like being in my early 20s. Normal People, written by a millennial, is a story that shows the anguish, depth of character and emotional resilience of two people who feel anything but ""normal"". Both Marianne and Connell constantly try to find within each other and themselves, the comfort of surpassing that insecurity. The world we are slowly inheriting is not that of our childhood and though it is a secondary focus in their lives, both characters grapple with how to navigate all that they care about against the normal concerns of feeling like they belong to their respective peer groups. I felt it was an incredibly adult representation of two people who could be any age, just trying to figure out their lives against the backdrop of the world. It served as a great reminder not to be so dismissive of youth, because after all, wasn't I there once?There are a plethora of fantastic reviews and they are rightly deserved. If you are on the fence, do yourself a favor and give this book a chance. With Normal People, Sally Rooney has cemented herself as an author that should be on everyone's must-buy list.Below are some of my favorite passages:""Denise decided a long time ago that it is acceptable for men to use aggression toward Marianne as a way of expressing themselves. As a child Marianne resisted, but now she simply detaches, as if it isn't of any interest to her, which in a way it isn't. Denise considers this a symptom of her daughter's frigid and unlovable personality. She believes Marianne lacks ""warmth,"" by which she means the ability to beg for love from people who hate her."" (p. 68)""It was true, Peggy and Jamie were not very good people; bad people even, who took joy in putting others down. Marianne fells aggrieved that she fell for it, aggrieved that she thought she had anything in common with them, that she'd participated in the commodity market they passed off as friendship. In school she had believed herself to be above such frank exchanges of social capital, but her college life indicated that if anyone in school had actually been willing to speak to her, she would would have behaved just as badly as anyone else. There is nothing superior about her at all."" (p. 200-01)""Somehow he was expressing more emotion that at any time in his life before, while simultaneously feeling less, feeling nothing."" (p. 221)""Not for the first time Marianne thinks cruelty does not only hurt the victim, but the perpetrator also, and maybe more deeply and more permanently. You learn nothing very profound about yourself simply by being bullied; but by bullying someone else you learn something you can never forget."" (p. 232)""Marianne wanted her life to mean something then, she wanted to stop all the violence committed by the strong against the weak, and she remembered a time several years ago when she had felt so intelligent and young and powerful that she almost could have achieved such a thing, and now she knew she wasn't at all powerful, and she would lie and die in the world of extreme violence against the innocent, and at most, she could help only a few people. It was so much harder to reconcile herself to the idea of helping a few, like she would rather help no one than do something so small and feeble, but that wasn't it either.

I was considering writing a full review but then I found that I don't have much to say about Normal People.- I liked that it tackled topics like capitalism and showed interest in world ""issues""- yet on the other hand I did not appreciate privileged college students discussing my region while smoking then getting high partying. Sure it happens irl life but it doesn't mean I have to like reading about it. I know books are reflections of real life and I know Palestinian conflict is known among the young generations of Ireland. Nevertheless, the way it was portrayed hers was inadequate and not serious enough.- I liked Rooney's idea, two flawed characters but this is the normal, they are normal - yet many of their choices frustrated me especially since some could've been solved by more communication - I was dreading that ending but found it underwhelming. Not disappointed but uhm okay? So what did I read about? Very little was happening and this is it?Someone told me the audiobook isn't very good, to give this book a fair shot I switched from audio to ebook, and yet it didn't make any difference. The narrator is good enough if with a heavy Irish accent. If anything the lack of speech marks made the dialogue better in the audio. As a non-native English speaker, I didn't face any issues with the accent. It took a few minutes for my ear to adapt but it was alright."
75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,Rating 4 out of 5,"I finished Normal People last night but had to think about it for a little while before writing this review, which is unusual for me. In summary: I really liked it! Marianne and Connell meet in high school, where Marianne is perceived by many as odd although she doesn’t care about popularity or public opinion. She’s from a wealthy family and bored by the obligations of school. Connell’s mother, Lorraine, cleans Marianne’s family’s home. Connell is popular, athletic, and well-liked. Marianne and Connell are friendly though not necessarily “friends” but this changes once they hook up. They both end up attending Trinity College in Dublin. It seems the roles have reversed as Marianne finds her place here and Connell feels isolated and somewhat adrift. The story is told in spurts of time periods (3 months later, 6 months later, 3 months later, etc.) detailing the progression and regression of the relationship between Marianne and Connell. Sometimes they’re best friends, other times more, and sometimes more distant, cordial, but less than close. I found their relationship interesting — Both characters had dislikable moments, yet both were relatable in different ways. Was it the familiarity of the pendulum of feelings about one person in your formative early adult years, as you try to continue figuring out who you are? I’m not sure, but I thoroughly enjoyed Normal People though I was nervous in anticipation of the ending, but found it to be very fitting. Highly recommend."

Ese conflicto, las vueltas que le he dado a la historia, lo que he pensado en los personajes sin darme cuenta... todo eso hace que me haya parecido una gran lectura.Por un lado me ha encantado cómo está escrita, ese presente tan directo, esos recuerdos intercalados, y los saltos temporales que hacen que no puedas parar de leer para conocer el siguiente encuentro. Porque de eso va el libro, de los encuentros entre dos jóvenes, dos amantes, dos amigos, que se pierden y se vuelven a encontrar constantemente.Me ha parecido profundo, verídico y a veces un poco pretencioso. Es una lectura que si te dejas llevar, si te metes en lo que te quiere contar, la disfrutarás muchísimo, a mi no me ha costado nada empatizar con los personajes aún no teniendo nada que ver con ellos (ni en edad ni en vivencias). Pero por otro lado no podía evitar pararme a pensar en lo snobs y elitistas que resultaban nuestros protagonistas aún intentando no serlo... Es extraño. Por otro lado hubiera preferido un poco más de sutileza en ocasiones (la familia de Marianne... ) pero por lo demás, creo que es una novela especialmente bien escrita.Por encima de todo, 'Gente normal' me ha sorprendido, me ha parecido original en su forma (aunque no tanto en su contenido), y ha conseguido atraparme hasta el punto de no querer salir de ese microcosmos que construye tan bien la autora. Novela rara pero muy recomendable, sí."

78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116523065-unknown-reviews,Rating 4 out of 5,"Edit: I'm upping this to four stars since it's been around six months and I still think about it a lot.Finishing Normal People has left me exhausted and on the verge of a headache. Somehow, a journey of suffering, trauma and love has been compressed into a span of 260 pages or so and I'm absolutely shattered. Connell and Marianne look to be opposites in every sense. He’s the star of the school soccer team and everyone likes him. She’s friendless and considered to be a bitch. Marianne lives in a multitude of wealth; Connell’s mother works as the cleaner at her house. Yet, despite these differences, Connell and Marianne become entangled in a relationship that begins as teenagers and continues right through adulthood as they study in Trinity College, Dublin. While I began this, I thought the writing was simple and this would be an easy read. It was only at the end, I realised how much weight this book held. Connell and Marianne are marred by flaws; they can be hypocritical, unlikeable, unable to properly express their feelings. But they are painfully real, and so are the journeys they go on. Connell is the popular one in school, and so keeps his relationship with Marianne hidden, ashamed of what his friends will think. As they attend college, however, Marianne is considered the one who is desirable and befriended by many people, while he grows more and more lonely. Rooney explores all sorts of themes in this book; mental health, class status, social constraints and so on. Connell never felt he belonged growing up in his small town of Carricklea, though to an outsider his life could be considered perfect. He goes to Trinity in the hope of finding people like him, but is burdened by his social anxiety and lack of wealth. I honestly found Connell’s narrative more interesting than Marianne’s since his struggles were more relatable. He’s left his town for a (predominantly) wealthy college and given up contact with all his old friends, but is no closer to the promise that if you didn’t like secondary school, college is where you’ll finally belong. It’s a driving point of Connell’s anxiety throughout the book – his old life was easy, as everyone at home knew and accepted him, but since leaving it, he’s lost that assurance in return for a future that may not guarantee him any happiness. Their feelings were suppressed so carefully in everyday life, forced into smaller and smaller spaces, until seemingly minor events took on insane and frightening significance. It was permissible to touch each other and cry during football matches. With that being said, I think Marianne’s story was still well-done. She’s grown up to consider herself unlovable and ends up looking for attention in troubling romances/friendships. I wasn’t interested in the BDSM aspects – I’m not sure if I’m content with how the book ended on that topic since I know nothing about it anyway. But with Connell’s unwavering support and admiration, Marianne at times breaks away from the cage she’s contained herself to and comes through for herself. Not for the first time Marianne thinks cruelty does not only hurt the victim, but the perpetrator also, and maybe more deeply and more permanently. You learn nothing very profound about yourself simply by being bullied; but by bullying someone else you learn something you can never forget.Besides the relationship, which I did find myself invested in due to its focus, I found equally, if not more, riveting the themes of class privilege and fitting in. The contrast in Marianne’s wealth against Connell’s shows up in everyday life, an example being where he tries to win a scholarship because he needs it, and she tries to do it for the validation of being special. Rooney also looks at both sides of an argument where school is either “the best days of your lives” or the process you have to suffer through until you move on to your “real life.” This book seems to say everyone would be a lot happier if we we’re all accepted. After all, why do we care so much about people’s views on us? What difference does their thoughts make to our lives and vice versa? Rooney also captures a lot of realism in the supporting characters despite their short appearances. Marianne’s friend Peggy constantly puts her down under the guise of being supportive. Some of Connell’s school friends were kind to Marianne while others tried to play off their meanness as a joke. She doesn’t play stereotypes, and it’s likely why I recognised a lot of the cast as people I actually know. Rooney also comments on how women are treated in society – how Marianne is the abused one and is often left reviled, while her perpetrator gets off scot free due to his gender. I don’t think I’d call this an epic love story. Sometimes I found Connell and Marianne’s relationship rather toxic. This story is more about peeking into the lives of two people who have been an essential part of each other’s survival, seeing their inner most thoughts, along with what happens to them. Their relationship is neither good, or bad, but endlessly messy as most things are. I was indifferent to the writing. It’s incredibly simple and doesn’t add to the story as much as it’s a way of connecting scenes. It’s been marketed as a novel that tells more than shows which probably is sneaky way of writing off genuine critiques. That being said, there were beautiful paragraphs in here, and you could start a sentence so simple, only to be slammed by the force of it at the end. This book is real, miserable, depressing, and yet, somehow hopeful. I may pick it up from time to time and read beautiful passages, but I don’t know if I have the energy to read it again. This book can be rather artificial and pretentious at times, and I thought the TV show executed the ending much better, but I still weirdly know the characters and their situations will stay with me. And I suppose, with that delivered, I don’t have much more to ask for. “Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything,”(Also, Paul Mescal deserves that Emmy, just saying.)"

This is a “slice of life” story with no real plot - we just follow these two young people: Connell and Marianne over a period of a couple years as they struggle with their complicated on-again off-again relationship. The writing itself in this book is actually really gorgeous and lyrical and beautiful.. but it also does the obnoxious no quotations around the dialogue thing that I absolutely hate. It just makes it so confusing to read at times because it’s hard to tell when someone is speaking and when they are just thinking things and bleh, I just really hate when authors don’t use quotations marks, they exist for a reason OKAY?These two characters were okay but they were very young and naive and I didn’t agree with a lot of their decisions. I just never really connected with them the way I wanted to. I never really got invested in the actual story because there is no plot and there is nothing to keep you invested in the story, I found it to be kind of boring actually. And then that ending was so lame and it didn’t really feel like an ending at all. Overall, this book was alright but it definitely wasn’t my kind of book and I think this is a little overhyped at the moment unfortunately. 😬"

De verdad, cuando empecé a leer Gente Normal le tenía fe, pensé que me gustaría porque Conversaciones Entre Amigos, el otro libro de Sally Rooney, me había entretenido. ¡Pero vaya decepción! Aquí tenemos a Connell y a Marianne, dos chicos que estudian en el mismo instituto y que, por las tardes, se vuelven a encontrar porque la madre de Connell limpia la casa de Marianne. Ella es rica, pero tímida, y él es un chico popular en el instituto, así que cuando empiezan a involucrarse, mantienen todo el asunto en secreto. Y luego terminan, pasan meses, vuelven, pasan dos semanas, terminan, pasan otro par de meses, vuelven, terminan... ¿sigo? ¡Este libro no iba hacia ninguna parte! Y eso fue lo que me cabreó. Que en un principio pensé que iba a suceder 
algo
, pero llegué al final y es más de lo mismo. Horas perdidas de mi vida, de verdad. Los dos protagonistas están estancados en una burbuja repetitiva que no los lleva hacia ningún lado. Sí, cuando no están juntos salen con otras personas y se van de fiesta y beben, pero luego vuelven al punto cero y todo comienza de nuevo. ¿Y los personajes que, tal vez, podrían ayudarnos a entender un poco más de las personalidades de Marianne y de Connell? Pues bien, muchas gracias. Son los personajes más planos e inútiles que he leído en mi vida. Podrían llegar a ser la clave que le diera la vuelta al libro, pero los desperdicia completamente la autora. De verdad, cada que Sally Rooney introducía un tema diferente a la relación de idas y venidas de Marianne y Connell, yo pensaba que el libro iba a repuntar, pero nada. La autora deja pasar grandes problemas como la salud mental, el suicidio, el maltrato y la autolesión sin pena ni gloria. Ugh."

Sadly it was not included in the shortlist, but if you like novels about relationships, this is excellent. It traces Marianne and Connell's friendship from childhood, and also tackles class difference and family violence. (I often find my favorite books from award lists are long but not shortlisted anyway.)Thanks to the publisher for granting me early access; sadly this doesn't come out in the USA until April 2019. You can bide your time by reading her earlier work.ETA: I reread this because I knew I was going to be a guest commentator for the Tournament of Books Super Rooster, the quarterfinal round between this and The Underground Railroad.

I would say that I was - and I still partially am - kind of conflicted about this book, it's a bit hard to explain. I was very skeptical when I was around a 1/4 of it but then my perception shifted and I found it captured my full attention. Sally Rooney's writing is exquisite. I loved it with all my heart and the absence of quotation marks didn't disturb me at all, i found it surprisingly agreeable and fresh ! The plot was good, the character development interesting and the ending, though a bit anticlimactic, was satisfying. There's also something that I found kind of interesting : You know this indescribable feeling when you find the title of the book in the book, and you finally understand why the author decided to title it like that ? Well, the first occurrence of the words ""normal people"" is so random and unexpected that it made me laugh. It's only the second time that you encounter these words, that they make sense with the general theme of the book. And I found that it was very fitting with the general theme of the book and its pace.Now there's a thing that I didn't particularly enjoy, which was the very performative aspect of Marianne and Connell's activism. This issue was a bit discussed throughout the book but not as much as I wanted it to be. But maybe it was deliberate : Marianne's class consciousness wasn't as ""complete"" as she thought it was ( perhaps because of her family's wealth ) and both Marianne and Connell's understanding of racial, ethnic and other issues that certain minorities face, was clouded by their own social status and privilege.Overall, it was a great book that surprised me many times and I'm really excited to read more of Sally Rooney's work !"

And I'm so glad I did. I found it difficult to put it aside, I wanted to keep hearing more.Normal People tells the story of two people, Connell and Marianne, who are anything but normal. Well, maybe they are and this is what many people go through. Each of them has problems. They meet when quite young, in high school. Connell's mom is the housekeeper for Marianne's family house. One comes from money, one doesn't. One is popular, one is not. But they are drawn to one another. For years they continuously circle one another. They end up going to the same college, where roles are reversed. The other is now popular, and the one who was before, now is not. No matter what they go through, they always come back to one another. They truly love one another, but many personal issues they have, keep tearing them apart. I dunno, maybe this is all normal.I love in-depth character studies and you get that with this one. You see the ups and downs of each of the characters, you see the issues they have, how neither one feels they are worthy. They love each other so much but their biggest problem is communication. Sheesh, I don't know how many times I wanted them to say what they were really feeling. I listened to the audio and really enjoyed it. I found myself looking for chores around the house so I could keep listening to this one. I had to know how they would turn out. I had to knock it a bit for the ending.

85,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors,Rating 4 out of 5,"Appearances might deceive. This much I have learned from Sally Rooney’s latest novel. If you read its blurb you might fall under the false impression that this is just another story about first love with conventional characters: Connell, a popular boy in high school, and Marianne, a smart and introverted outcast with the added complication of different social backgrounds. Their secret connection occurs outside school when they meet at Marianne’s house when Connell’s mother finishes her shift as a cleaning lady there.I guess many readers might have stopped reading after that boneless introduction, but if you have persisted, I will try to offer compensation for that unappealing start.“Normal People” is a fascinating psychological portrait of the journey towards adulthood in this new generation where the battle between popularity and personal insecurity influences the decisions that will define the course of a life. This is a story of mutual fascination between two lost people who understand each other beyond what is being said. Curiously enough, what happens to the protagonists is mostly marked by the silences and misunderstandings in their conversations. This is precisely, in my opinion, what makes Rooney’s novel outstanding. She has an incredible skill to capture the mental processes of the characters, the way they perceive reality and misinterpret it because of their lack of self-confidence. Through Sally Rooney’s eyes, the reader can understand, even identify with inexcusable behavior, perverse reactions and even cringing responses in dialogues where fear of being rejected dominates the pace and the exact choice of words in the exchanges between the characters.Marianne’s absence of self-defense mechanisms, her incomprehensible need to be physically humiliated in order to feel loved will offer Connell disproportionate power to do with Marianne what he pleases, and that will be his greatest challenge: to be mature enough to deal with such an excessive surrender and to discover his own capacity for selfless love.If I had to come up with some classics to compare this novel to, I’d dare say it combines the romance of Jane Austen with the complexity of Flaubert’s “Sentimental Education”. The education in this case takes place in the years of college at Trinity, Dublin. A pity though that there is nothing in the book that evokes a bit of the setting, of my so adored Ireland and the misty moods that permeate the pebbled alleys of its ancient villages. I would have appreciated descriptive passages to frame the evolution of Connell and Marianne’s relationship and provided a certain lyrical touch that I found missing in Rooney’s style, although I admit she is consistent with the way she presents her characters: young, unsentimental and living in a globalized world. Nevertheless, this is a gripping novel, a bittersweet story that shows the reader the way sex and power shape us, how the desire to hurt and be hurt, to love and be loved are but the evolution of a long conversation… and the silences in between. Incredible that someone so young could be so wise."

This is the story of Connell and Marianne, and their relationship, as they navigate from high school and throughout college. The entire time I read this I was screaming in my head for these two just to be together and to stop screwing everything up....for me. Yes, you read that right, I felt like I had some personal stake in this relationship and that can only be attributed to Sally Rooney's writing. She made me become invested in these characters. They are both damaged people and yet I adored each of them immensely even when they were infuriating me. I alternated between wanting to hug them and smack them with each turn of the page. 
""He’s amused at himself, getting wrapped up in the drama of novels like that. It feels intellectually unserious to concern himself with fictional people marrying one another. But there it is: literature moves him. One of his professors calls it “the pleasure of being touched by great art.”

89,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38055348-lea,Rating 3 out of 5,"“I don't know what's wrong with me, says Marianne. I don't know why I can't be like normal people.”I rightly thought that Sally Rooney is not my type of writer, but interested in the buzz around her and the cult following she has I decided to read at least one of her novels.Rooney’s writing style is very simplistic, somewhat odd, in short, sometimes almost unfinished sentences, mirroring someone’s exercise sheet in a creative writing course. Rooney was fairly young when she wrote “Normal People”, and her immaturity as a writer reflects on the text. That being said, in the light of the plot and the characters of this book this went to her advantage, and the book’s popularity testifies to that successfully. Also, with one other aspect I was also surprised, I thought Rooney was not for me because I expected her work to be saturated with a lot of leftist, Marxist rambling without a real solid formation of the views, but I was pleasantly surprised that was not the case. Rooney presented some of these views, for example on class differences, but subtly as they are not the star of the novel.The stars of the novel, what makes this story so compelling, are the characters a lot of people highly relate to, Connell and Marianne. I especially heard a lot of women describing Rooney's writing as: ""I finally felt seen / understood."" What Rooney nails is the feeling of alienation in the youth of the modern world. Rooney’s characters, Marianne and Connell, feel both isolated and insecure in their coming of age in modern society. Like many of us, they are in love with books, books that can do the thing they themselves cannot manage - communicate true feelings and verbalize internal struggles. The short, simple sentences are appropriate for the atmosphere of the world of Marianne and Connell, both trapped in their own inner worlds of conflict, misery and insecurity - not knowing and not being able to let anyone in. Rooney portrays in realistic manner the challenges of adolescence - ones that people like Marieanne and Connell - shy, self-conscious, introverted - have to oftentimes face completely alone. She also paints the corruption of young love in the modern world - where the times of sexual liberties, when an emotional connection or romantic exclusive of the relationship are not prequisitions for sexual relations - the whole generation of people is oftentimes robbed of the right to experience young love, to expose their romantic, not only sexual, feelings openly. In modern times the tides are changed and now, the sexual desire is welcomed but romantic feeling and emotional connection are not - as once in victorian days sexual desire was repressed in obscurity, now the emotional needs are shamed, portrayed as an unnecessary, weak, inconvenient - both negations being equally hurting to human completeness. That is why our protagonists - Marianne and Connell progress in sexual and intellectual development, but fail to progress in psychological maturation, the development in the emotional realm for which the quality of the relationship with others is vital. For today’s generations, it is much easier to reach sexual liberation than emotional one, as we can see in the relationship of Marianne and Connell, and even much more, its relatability, making this novel a best-seller and Rooney the voice of youth. Modern man does not have to fight anymore for the freedom to have sex, he has to fight for the freedom to get attached, which is often suffocated by the modern rules of dating. And both basic needs, for sex and for attachment, are equally important and equally vital for psychological well-being. Without attachment, and not being able to reach it, we are just like Marianne and Connor, intelligent, accomplished human beings, but painfully lonely, ultimately suffocating in our despair.“Most people go through their whole lives, without ever really feeling that close with anyone.” Male and female relationships are hard, especially in adolescence, with burdens of insecurity and it takes time to learn how to communicate, how to open up, to get security to show your true emotions. It’s easier to enter only the realm of attraction and sex and dwell in it, which a lot of modern people do for years than to work to open up yourself and acquire the ability to form a complete, healthy, solid relationship. And the dark side of the modern dating game feeds the avoidance pathology, giving a person just enough pleasure in sexual satisfaction, so it won't be necessary to go that step further.“Being alone with her is like opening a door away from normal life and then closing it behind him.” Marianne was especially burdened in the area of ​​formation of healty relationship and communication, having experienced domestic abuse from her brother. It could be said that Connell was manifesting the avoidance attachment pattern and narcissistic traits, being obsessed with how people are going to perceive him, having a lot of shame inside, but Marianne definitely has traits of borderline personality disorder, that keep her in trauma bonding and a cycle of only being attracted to men that humiliate her in one way or another and leave her and experiencing dissociation from reality in the moments of abuse.“Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn't know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it.” Having my profession in mind, it is important to note that if you heavily relate to Marianne in these the areas I mention above, it is safe to say you should talk about that to a person of confidence, or a mental health professional (or both). It is troublesome to me when I see how many women do relate to Marianne, having in mind that sexual liberation in some ways worked to women’s and men’s disadvantage - making the pathological behavior normal and welcoming it. And that's why I found the themes of the novel more than mention-worthy. I’m not a huge fan of Rooney’s writing, but the ideas in the novel are so relevant to the modern culture and millennial pathos that her work is almost a must-read."

This much about the (inter)relational dynamic existing between persons X and Y? How does she achieve such impressive levels of nuancing? And what does it even mean, Rooney seems to be asking, to be a person, in the world of today?‘Levels’ is the operative word. Through the main new-to-adulthood protagonists, Connell and Marianne, and their relationships with other people their age, Rooney explores the elusive, ever-changing understanding and formation of one’s individuality versus one’s identity, or identification with specific communities and contexts that allow for some level of well-adjustedness. She probes into the very real (im)possibilities underlying any one person’s endeavour to come to terms with the staggering brutality of non-belonging, and reveals that there is no escaping that sense of lostness, and (self)destruction, that characterises human existence. Levels of conditionings and awareness – internal and external – overlap, with chaos necessarily prevailing. Human connection, in all of this, suffers tremendously. And yet, when two people do connect, on a deep human level, there is no turning back.This is Connell and Marianne’s meandering – and essentially messy – story. As all the other characters in the story, they are noticeably damaged in very specific ways. And this is what makes all of them fundamentally normal. Damage, in human relations, is the norm. What is made very clear in the novel is that Marianne is the epitome and extreme case of what being damaged truly means. She comes to us – with her vaguely-traced, because too painful, backstory of crude violence and unlovingness – as one who has never quite found her place in the world. Always and forever socially unaccepted. That is, until the conflicted Connell, whose Achilles’s heel has him haphazardly flitting from his powerful connection with (and love for) Marianne to his desire to be socially accepted, humiliates her to the extent that she begins to dissimulate well-adjustedness whilst really and truly and increasingly generating her own disintegration and degradation. Connell, on his part, fails to realise that he cannot quite stand in the tricky in-between. Having experienced what it means to be human through Marianne, his attempts to integrate himself into society will necessarily fail. Mind you, he does insist and persevere. But it takes just the one glance at Marianne, whenever they (as they inevitably keep doing) cross paths, for him to remember what they both have known all along: this is different. It is the real deal. In the hostile world they must navigate, difference prevails. But together and towards each other, they experience a sense of shared community that makes it possible – as dangerous and problematic as this is – to heavily depend on each other, to exert that kind of power over each other that is both wonderful and run-for-your-life disturbing. Illusions are seen to progressively collapse, and they are forced to face – time and time again – the sheer scale of their self-delusions.In this novel, Rooney goes all the way: she delves into the dark corners of self-annihilation; into acute sensations of pain, humiliation, shame. All of those palpable human emotions that alter one’s relationship with the world and other human beings. Many times, the narration reveals harrowing flashes of nothingness: the humans’ impossibility to mentally and emotionally surpass the very foundational determinations of their being. Humans, it seems, are made up of the tensions between differing identities and cubistic dimensions of themselves. Being vulnerable, or allowing oneself to be vulnerable, means transitioning between contradictory modes of being, and not quite understanding who you really are. Because probably there is no such thing. It is far more complex than that.What is so surprising about this novel is its seemingly effortless seamlessness. The narration progresses in a linear fashion: it is episodic, as it were; largely detailing their studying years at Trinity College through the lens of their relations. There are intervening gaps between each chapter, usually a few weeks or months apart, that are supplemented, however, by the smooth insertion of flashbacks, aimed – certainly – at adding depth to the storyline and layering even further the articulation of the main thematic concerns. The overall effect is that of a peculiar to-and-fro movement – happening at the level of the narration. That Rooney achieves such levels of insight into the nature of human writhing – the fragile intimacy of exposing oneself and yearning to be someone – and to do so through plain and sober prose is simply astounding. Simplicity of storyline seems to work in the novel’s favour, making it possible for the narrative to question – indefatigably and obsessively – standard assumptions on the nature of being and human relationships. The inextricable ties between people. Regardless of some minor flaws (perhaps subtlety of expression suffered at times, or could use some fine-tuning), I find myself unable to rate this other than 5 stars. There is simply no doubt in my mind-and-heart that Normal People is solidly literary in scope and execution. Judging by the distinctly pre-perceived sense of the novel's everlasting effect on me, I would say that the starkness and powerful, vibrating force of Rooney's writing has already and very undeniably penetrated the core and essence of my being. Possibly ‘altered the colour of my mind’ (Wuthering Heights). I genuinely needed to read this."

Marianne is the dorky rich girl and Connell is the popular working class football star whose mom cleans Marianne's family home. If that sort of high school cliche doesn't sell you it soon slouches into NA territory. Marianne hooks up with the wrong kind of guys and Connell dates bland nice girls. Will they or won't they? We spend the entire book watching the two dance in and out of each others lives in what amounts to a Marxist romance novel. People hate this and the growing social media hype surrounding author Sally Rooney isn't exactly endearing her to serious readers.Well screw them. All aboard the hype train!I loved Normal People. As Rooney states, it's essentially a nineteenth century novel dressed up in contemporary clothing. Jane Austen for the social media set. Say. No. More. Marianne and Connell are recognizable types in high school but in college their status flips. Marianne is suddenly interesting and surrounded by a large coterie of friends and acquaintances while Connell feels like a milk-drinking culchie lost among the prep school kids in their plum chinos, carting around MacBooks. The two weave in and out of each others lives. Sometimes dating, sometimes just friends, and to me it never mattered whether they ended up together or not - it felt more like an examination of a pivotal four years post high school where they both wrestle with what it means to be in a relationship, grapple with depression and grief, understand their own worth and contend with the shifting power dynamics inherent with relationships. Consider me a fan. https://youtu.be/WVTgzL9ZCj8 for more gushing over the hardest book you'd ever want to try and handsell."
93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard---golden-reviewer,Rating 4 out of 5,"Longlisted for the 2018 Man Booker – and the only book published after the longlist was announced, and so the last I came to read (a month and 2 days after the announcement). While not shortlisted for that prize - the book is now (and not surprisingly) starting to sweep other awards: Irish Book of The Year - Best Novel. National Book Award - International Author, Waterstone's Book of the Year - Best Novel and Best Book, Costa Award - Best Novel, British Book Awards - fiction winner and overall winner, Encore award for best second novel. I have little doubt that the author will be the one on the Booker longlist that we will hear most of in the years ahead and that this book (probably alone of the longlist) will be on the shelves in mainstream bookshops in say 5 years' time.Returning to my review:The other books on the longlist draw on wider elements: graphics and alt-right, crime genre conventions, Greek mythology and legend, immersive research into the penal system, environmental passion, free verse and film noir, dystopia, grime and urban slang, refugee crisis, steampunk and slavery, greyhounds and spying, stream of consciousness: and the reader’s view of each book depends, at least in part, on her (or his) views on how well the author has translated those aspects into languageThis book is though little more than an internally focused, but two sided tale of millennial student friendship and love – and hence to a very large extent stands or falls on the readers view of the author’s writing and her characterisation of the thoughts and motivations of the two protagonists.In my view the author largely succeeds and, much to my surprise, this is one of my favourite books on the longlist.Connell and Marianne attend the same school – Connell quietly popular, Marianne widely shunned for her perceived eccentricity – but the two have two links: both are intellectual and Connell’s single mother cleans for Marianne’s widowed mother. The two start a tentative sexual and covert relationship and both apply (successfully) for Trinity where their relative status is turned on its head and more in line with their social status – Connell struggling with the simultaneous vacuity and confidence of his fellow students, and Marianne thriving.The book which moves forwards in unevenly spaced chapters which are dated and title (for example) Three Months Later, chapters which are told form alternating third party viewpoints and which often look back on key events since the last chapter and more particularly on the ever changing dynamic of the relationship between the two.Connell’s relationship to literature (like the authors) is complex – struggling with the middle class attitude to literature he still desperately wants to be part of it – which even leads to the book’s ending. Connell (and the author’s) ambiguity is captured in a number of quotes: 
It seems to Connell that the same imagination he uses as a reader is necessary to understand real people also, and to be intimate with them.Connell couldn’t think of any reason why these literary events took place, what they contributed to anything, what they meant. They were attended only by people who wanted to be the kind of people who attended themIt was culture as class performance, literature fetished for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they made afterwards feel superior to the undereducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about 
Key themes examined in the book include: Class dynamics and social privilege; Masculinity and feminity – and the privileges and burdens of each; The aftermath of the end of the Celtic Tiger, and its economic and social effects on the millennial generation that reached adulthood after it, including their loss of faith in capitalism (having already lost faith in the church); Power dynamics and how these can alter across different social milieu; Fitting in and standing out – and how different people can adopt different positions over time; Intimacy and independence ; Self-image and its interaction with abusive relationships and with depression.I described Sally Rooney’s last book – Conversations With Friends – as “an interesting debut by a young author writing with a fresh new voice about a young character experiencing a very old story (a woman having an affair with an older married man)”. Despite its many differences, this book is again simply a young author writing with a fresh new voice about (in this case) two young characters experiencing an even older story – how does friendship translate into love and how can you really know the mind of someone else. Albeit one with a dark undercurrent. Jane Austen for the millennial generation. 
One night the library started closing just as he reached the passage in Emma where it seems like Mr Knightly is going to marry Harriet, and he had to close the book and walk home in a state of strange emotional agitation …………. It feels intellectually unserious to concern himself with fictional people marrying one another. But there it is – literature moves him. 
And there it is – this book moved me."

A story of a popular high school boy, Connell, whose mother cleans house for the mother of an awkward high school age girl, Marianne. A girl who is somewhat of social outcast at their high school. Aside from seeing him routinely outside of school when he picks his mother up at her house, the only other thing they have in common is that they’re both bright students. In fact, they are the smartest in their class. Book smart, anyway. A somewhat awkward relationship starts as they have small opportunities to talk while he waits for his mother to finish her cleaning chores, and it isn’t long before they are involved in a secret, sexual relationship. Secret, because he doesn’t want his friends to know, and because she is so used to being treated poorly by her family and others, this doesn’t seem to raise an issue for her. After graduation, they both attend Trinity College in Dublin, and their roles are reversed in terms of popularity. This creates a personal struggle for Connell, and for Marianne, as the shift in their relationship becomes more apparent, their friendship begins to be affected. Following their on-and-off relationship over the years, this began to suffer, for me, as the story went on. There seemed to be rather significant gaps in the story, I didn’t understand her lack of a relationship with her family, her brother’s abusive attitude and behavior, or her mother’s lack of anything approaching affection for her. There were parts that I loved, parts that I found disturbing, and parts that just felt awkward. Overall I found myself deeply moved, and alternately disturbed, by this story.

97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,Rating 3 out of 5,"Here's another book about attractive people fucking, in case anyone needed any more of that, and are you ready to play the Attractive People Fucking Drinking Game?- One shot for each different side of the tracks the lovers are from- One shot for heteronormativity- One shot for every book the guy is reading that's supposed to make him look intellectual but it's just another book about attractive people fucking- One shot for each silly misunderstanding that tears them apart- Silly misunderstandings are the Pulp Fiction briefcase of romance. It doesn't matter what it is, we just needed something to get the plot moving. Every time you see a problem that could have been immediately cleared up with a conversation, do a shot and die a little inside.these are the attractive people Hulu cast in the series they already made- Two shots for inevitable betrayal- One shot for every time some idiot makes up a drinking game about something- Three shots for every sex scene that's not as hot as it thinks it is. There isn’t really as much sex as you’d like there to be, considering this is self-consciously a sexy book. Some relatively vanilla sex is described in relatively conventional ways. And then there's...- Five shots for kink-shaming- Is Marianne pretending to be into bondage as a form of self-harm? This feels a lot like that old insinuation that submissives are broken or weird, and dominants are violent bullies. If Rooney means to imply that BDSM is an expression of poor self esteem, she’s wrong. If she’s implying that it could be fine but Marianne, in her inexperience, has found some unhealthy expressions of it, she hasn’t made that point legibly. And if she’s just trying to throw some kink in to make the book steamier, she manifestly fails by making the BDSM scenes sad. I want to be clear that I love these movies deeply, they're so dumb and Dakota Johnson is 100% aware of that, watching her undermine every scene with sarcasm is truly rewarding- One shot for every beautiful little observation Rooney makes, like that Marianne's shitty friend Peggy is exactly the sort of person who goes on vacation to Europe and starts saying ""ciao"" all the time and wearing huge sunglasses. These are nice touches. Sally Rooney is an extremely competent writer, and this is a fun and easy book to read. The story itself is basically a plot from Riverdale, but there's nothing wrong with Riverdale, which is why Normal People got made into a TV series before you could say ""attractive people fucking."" - Four shots for every time some asshole starts a big discussion about whether this is Literature or just Attractive People Fucking. Who cares? It's fun to read! This guy over here pretending he likes Gabriel Garcia Marquez or whatever, have some fun in your life you great gawping twat. And it is fun! I liked reading it! But deep down it's at least a little bit legitimate to wonder whether something is fundamentally silly or not, at least when it ends up on as many top ten lists as Normal People has, and this book is fundamentally silly. It's a bodice ripper (literally). Put a pasty Irish Fabio on the cover and we're off to the races. Bring a big bottle with you; we're going to be doing a lot of shots."
98,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry,Rating 5 out of 5,"Something in the way she moves, Attracts me like no other lover""Something,"" G. Harrison, 1969An Irish novel observes four years in the life of a young man and woman from the west of Ireland as they graduate high school and matriculate at Trinity College in Dublin.  It neither breaks new ground nor brims with profundity. Nor does the story annoint Sally Rooney as her generation's Voice--a label she's rejected. What makes the novel and its writer Sally Rooney so special is the overall real-feel, sharp dialogue, a je ne sais quoi elevating it to a sublime redemptive tale whose power lies in illuminating truth at the edge of love within the cracks of the human condition. Normal People is a fascinating, page-flipping little love story, free of sweet sentimentality and high romantic notions. The wonder here is in seeing these 17-year-olds grow and mature, endure travesty, adversities, separations, longings, transforming from self-absorbed, anxious and insecure teens from different classes, who suffer and inflict humiliation, worry if she really loves me or if he can get past my ""sub fetish,"" into young adults, whose ties feel so binding (pun not originally intended) that the couple is, in a word, holistic--as the novel conveys beautifully--with a self-awareness holding sacrifice, selflessness, accommodations for each other foremost, signalling a deep human magnetism, the pair's oak-strong spiritual connection.Nothing tangible lasts. We grow old and pass away. While Normal People isn't a fairy tale--no happily ever after--it is a welcome and timely and really refreshing reminder that for us such spiritual love is possible, though only if you work hard at it aware that such love transcendent is increasingly rare (it seems) and thus worth everything we have and all we can give."

The way she constructs her characters is something extraordinary and I am so very glad this book is on the longlist for the Women’s Prize for Fiction. I needed a brilliant book after some of other nominated books just did not work for me at all. I really hope she’ll make the shortlist.Told in alternating viewpoints and skipping forward in time, this book chronicles Connell’s and Marianne’s friendship/relationship from their final year in school until shortly after their undergraduate degree. It is both fast-paced and intimate in a way that nearly perfectly catered to my reading preferences. For me the intimacy of her story worked exceedingly well; she narrows her gaze into those two characters in a way that made them near unbearably real for me. Rooney’s prose is readable and without frills but still expertly done to keep me engaged but for me, Rooney’s biggest strength are her characters; they are fully realized and flawed people who I cannot help but root for. Even more so than in her debut novel, she expertly broke my heart. I felt for these two people who keep on missing each other, who just for the life of them cannot communicate effectively, and who still cannot be without each other.While I think that Conversations With Friends is the stronger of her two novels, both of them are ridiculously well-done and I am glad Rooney gets all the praise she deserves. She is such an exciting voice and I just cannot wait to see what she does next.You can find this review and other thoughts on books on my blog."
100,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4593541-barry-pierce,Rating 4 out of 5,"In her first novel, ‘Conversations with Friends’, Sally Rooney introduced us all to her schtick – young Irish novels for young Irish people. Her debut followed a sort of ménage à quatre in which no character, and I literally mean no character, came out as loveable or bearable. It was like witnessing a car crash in slow motion. ‘Conversation with Friends’ also lacked a cohesive mood and prose style. The Guardian rightfully bashed Rooney as a non-visual writer, stating that the dialogue in the novel read like ‘he-said she-said reportage‘. Yet the public warmed to the novel, and Rooney herself. Therefore, the publication of her follow-up book, ‘Normal People’, was heralded from on high as if Rooney was finally gifting her adoring public with another darling epistle.Continue reading my review on my blog here."

Jan and I had so much to say and speak about in this story that it made us both realize what a wonderful book this was. Any book that makes for a road traveled through darkness and despair can certainly be one that encourages deep and meaningful thoughts and words. Normal People was just such a book. In this age of instant communication, texts, email, social media, we do think that we make instant connections, that people understand us, they get us and we get them. However, what is often left unsaid, contained within our mind, might just be the link to our happiness. For the two main protagonists in this book, their communication with one another never really happens for one is ever so afraid to open up herself and the other is afraid of the social strata he thinks he just can never attain.Marianne, is a troubled young woman, a pariah in high school, an abused child who retreats into her shell and allows no one to invade her inner self. She knows Connell, a fellow student, the son of a woman who is a maid to her family so when they strike up a relationship initially sexual in nature, but then it develops into something more. Their relationship is kept ever so secret, and they avoid each other so awkwardly in social situations that it is painful to read of their struggles. Connell is attracted to Marianne. He is the handsome, out going, brilliant student who looks like, on the surface, to have it all. But, he too, harbors major insecurities and when both Marianne and Connell head off to Trinity College, those deep devils embedded in both their psyches begin to emerge in force. They both feel unworthy, Marianne feels she should be abused for that is what she deserves,“There’s always been something inside her that men have wanted to dominate, and their desire for domination can look so much like attraction, even love.” while Connell feels that he just does not belong, lacking the thing he thinks makes the world go round.“That's money, the substance that makes the world real. There's something so corrupt and sexy about it” They are both intellectually brilliant, but in matters of the heart and living, they are ever so lacking.This is such a sad tale, for these two people thrown together through their young lives, love and care for one another. Problem is one is ever so afraid to let it be known because she feels she deserves abuse, while the other can't seem to feel he is worthy of anything, especially love. As they grow into young adults their roles reverse as Marianne becomes what Connell once was and Connell becomes what Marianne was. It's a story of words unspoken, of thoughts not expressed, of two lives that should have melded together and yet are worlds apart. Neither one of them feels worthy of love, worthy of holding a place on this earth, and the tragedy of this story is that they might never find out that they are destined to be with one another. Sally Rooney has written a tale of heartbreak and hopelessness. She takes us deep inside her characters, allowing the reader to truly see their melancholy and misery. In this world of people portraying their lives so openly on social media platforms is this story really the way many people are, insecure, forlorn, and in misery? Or is it that these two characters are so psychologically broken that their chances for happiness will never happen and they will go through their lives broken, dejected, and disheartened? It's their fear and their thought that they deserve misery that drives them. This is a tale of woe, depression, and despondency.Thank you to Sally Rooney, Crown Publishing, and NetGalley for a copy of this bookTo see both of our reviews you can go here: http://yayareadslotsofbooks.wordpress..."

I was so looking forward to Normal People, and it started out so promisingly—some of the high school stuff was really well done. But as the book went on I became more and more disenchanted. The conflicts in this book (rich vs. poor, good childhood vs. bad childhood, popular vs. unpopular) are some of the ones I find least interesting, and while the portrayal of Connell's depression was heartfelt, I seemed to have trouble working up any strong interest. I was frustrated with so many elements of this novel: Why were all the villains SO evil with no explanation or nuance? Why did I have to keep hearing about how attractive Marianne's sun-kissed shoulders and Connell's body were, as if this were a YA romance? Why did Connell and Marianne break up over a silly misunderstanding that also seemed like a contrived obstacle from a YA romance? Why didn't Marianne get a job instead of staying home all summer with her horrible mother and brother? I realize she may have had some attachment issues there or something, but... just get a summer job like (wait for it) normal people do!It's true that I may not have read this novel under ideal circumstances—I was pretty busy and had trouble devoting extended amounts of time to it. But even so, the highest I can go is three stars. I couldn't have gone into this with more good will, and by the end I was just waiting for it to be over. I read online (in the Independent) that Sally Rooney actually wrote Normal People and Conversations with Friends at around the same time, which might explain why Normal People felt more like a first novel to me. But that's cause for optimism, because it means her writing hasn't necessarily gone downhill. I will hold out hope that novel #3 will be amazing. "

The TV series - OMG! The best series I've watched in a long time. I'm in awe. Perfect casting, sets, the cinematography is superb! I loved every minute of it. 10/10 * 
Well, well, well, what do you know, this novel snuck up on me and then it grew on me so much, I ended up loving it.Metaphorical pat on the back to myself for giving Rooney another go, despite not liking her debut novel Conversation with Friends.I thought this was brilliant. Rooney's ability to convey people's complex and contradictory nature impressed me a great deal. This is not a showy kind of novel with fancy words or turn of phrases. But it's so damn real, nuanced and utterly believable. The characterisations are top notch. Loneliness, dysfunctional families, bullying, not fitting in, depression, friendships are some of the themes that appear in this novel.Hell, I got so immersed into this novel, I didn't even notice there were no quotation marks for the dialogue. As far as I'm concerned, this was almost perfect and it goes in the same category as other favourite novels written by female writers such as Sarah Winman, Deborah Levy, Ali Smith."

I highly recommend it, especially if you have read the book. Sally Rooney was very involved in the production, development and writing.Original review:""It's funny the decisions you make because you like someone, he says, and then your whole life is different. I think we're at that weird age where life can change a lot from small decisions.""It is hard to say why it is this book was such a wrenching emotional experience for me, but I completed the last pages in tears. I suspect it had as much to do with me and what I needed to learn and feel as much as the writer’s ability to draw me in, as good books will do, but draw me in she surely did. I loved this book, oh, felt just raw at the end, and for days later, but since there are already more than 16,000 reviews of this book as of today, I’ll try to make this short. Try.I just reread Milkman and some stories from Dubliners in this kind of randomly occurring Irish section of my Growing Up course, and my emotional sense of all the girls/women of these stories is on the one hand in a certain sense that they are highly likable, intensely private women who are also for a time fragile to the point of paralysis (Eveline in Dubliners at the gate as the ship with her lover departs: paralysis; middle-sister unable to speak--partly because no one listens to her!--full of all of her “middle-ness,” as she attempts to fend off her stalker milkman and Somebody McSomebody), and now Marianne, silenced and conditioned to silence by her brother and father, passive, psychologically abused. So, yes, I have this sense of these women as at times strong, insightful, immensely interesting, and yet fragile, traumatized, dissociated in some ways from fully functional life. Oh and the men that in part shape these women's lives, they also seem dissociated, sad, lost, but often abusive in a variety of ways.“Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn't know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it.”I was completely absorbed by the story of (rich, reclusive, reader) Marianne and (poor, popular footballer, eventual writer) Connell, a story of communication (and the struggle to do this), class, family, secrecy, and the legacy of psychological and physical abuse. It’s a coming-of-age story, a kind of nevertheless romance-- “Most people go through their entire lives, Marianne thought, without ever really feeling that close with anyone.”--with understated plain language and rich psychological insight. I like the discussions of reading, the reflections about reading and learning. I loved Connell’s mother, Lorraine, so much, such a good character. But I love the rich and complex main characters, too, of course. They make so many mistakes, they are so human, they just filled me with anguish and hope. I was late to the game in getting to it, but was devastated by it, in so many good and useful ways. Now on to/back to (her earlier) Conversations with Friends. I am so, so much a fan. Oh, how I loved this book!"

112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102110396-maliha-tabassum-tisha,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is one of those few books that ended up surpassing all my expectations. This is one of those even fewer ones that held the power to destroy my heart. It just felt so relatable, so personal. It's been a million years since a book had affected me this much. It's just too special for me. I'm a mess of emotions at the moment and am definitely going to sound incoherent but we're gonna talk about it anyways. 

“Most people go through their whole lives, without ever really feeling that close with anyone.”

This is a story of two people who belong to two opposite poles of our society (You think you're tired of that trope? Think again.) Set in the backdrop of small-town Ireland, it begins when they're both in their senior year at high school. Marianne hails from a wealthy family where Connell's mother serves as a cleaner; she lives a ""drastic life"", depressed, misunderstood and socially cast out, whereas he is the popular jock grappling with social anxiety on a daily basis. We can sense the attraction between them right from the opening and when they start a sexual relationship in secret, it doesn't come as a surprise. Anyhow, when Connell realizes he has put his social life at stake, he breaks up. Soon after this, they've started going to the same university and the tables have turned: Marianne is popular now and Connell, having lost his own spotlight, becomes ever so confused, self-conscious and withdrawn. Even though they don't need secrecy anymore they also can't stay together for long — their affection for each other pulling them close as their personal struggles and circumstances tear them apart — like a vicious tug of war. Despite everything, they're but two very lonely souls, trying in vain to harmonize their personal lives with their mental maladies all on their own.

""Their life in Carricklea, which they had imbued with such drama and significance, just ended like that with no conclusion, and it would never be picked back up again, never in the same way.""

The chapters serve as consecutive points in time across four years in the lives of the duo, each enclosing flashbacks of past events. Over the course of time, both shape the other's life while coming of age and growing as a person. The alternating perspectives provide insights into their thoughts, which are raw and intimate to the point that these two fictional characters appear shockingly true to life. Their scars and insecurities are slowly laid bare, and the powerful bond connecting their souls, never letting them stay apart for long, comes to light. The book not only deals with Connell and Marianne's relationship and respective mental states but many major social and political issues as well: capitalism, social class, privileges, power dynamics, gender roles to name a few. It also explores in depth the emotional struggles these two people face as they come of age; how they can affect a relationship and even bring it to the verge of dissolution. It illustrates how childhood trauma can indelibly scar someone and take control of their life. It uncloaks the loneliness mostly kept concealed under the veil of power and popularity. This book will make you ponder over and question so many things you hadn't yet. This is a character-driven story, as a matter of fact. You'll be disappointed if you try to look for a plot.

“Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn't know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it.”

There are numerous things in the book that hit home. There were moments when my heart grew too heavy to contain inside my chest. I smiled and shed tears of joy whenever Marianne and Connell chanced upon their brief moments of peace in each other's company. I cried and cursed when some self-doubt or miscommunication wickedly conspired to pull them apart. Literally the entire time I'd been worried about the characters and praying hard that I don't have to read about anything more horrible.Despite the fact that this novel was about Connell and Marianne both, I was badly rooting for Marianne the whole time. All her life she had been forced to consider herself as someone so unworthy of love and happiness she had grown to despise herself. Even as a popular adult in college she was purposely making bad decisions and dating abusive men just in order to hurt herself.

“Generally I find men are a lot more concerned with limiting the freedoms of women than exercising personal freedom for themselves.”

Now, you must've heard it before but let me remind you once again: this book is a rather polarising one. You can either love it until the end of time or hate it with your entire existence. If you're comfortable with a brutal, unromanticized depiction of reality, can identify with the mc's and their longing for one another, then Normal people will live in your heart forever I believe. Or else you'll just miss the whole point of it. You'll decide that both the mc's are too silly and dramatic, and tag the book as some plot-less trash. If you've already read and hated it I'll genuinely respect that and have nothing against you, but if you haven't and are planning to pick this up, please do proceed with caution. This is not your typical angsty romance. Sally Rooney's prose is so elegant and lyrical it feels like poetry. Her writing has that punch you won't be able to dodge. There are myriads of quotes and passages from the book that I wouldn't be forgetting in a gazillion years. Due to the lack of quotation marks in the text tho, I initially did have trouble reading but I got used to it in no time. I could realize how this particular formatting contributed to the mood of the book as well as enhancing its emotional effects on the reader.

“... the snow keeps falling, like a ceaseless repetition of the same infinitesimally small mistake.”

So, let's talk about the ending now. I'm not a fan of the ending, to be honest with you. Although I could've slept better if the book had ended differently, I'm also very pleased to see where Connell and Marianne both find themselves in in the end. I often wonder if it's better off with an ending like that. To conclude, I want to say that this is one of the greatest books I've ever read. It's everything I wanted in my life at the moment. It's scalding, it's heartbreaking, it's unputdownable. It's something you'd want to read over and over again, yet you won't find the courage to.....

114,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10519601-vicky-phenkos,Rating 5 out of 5,"I tried reading Normal People before but didn’t get very far. Thanks to David's review, I decided to give it another try. And so glad I did! I think I know what caught me out the first time; it was that the writing operates at two different levels: on the one hand, the level of conversations (I’m wondering about Rooney’s first book now, Conversations with Friends), intimate conversations between lovers, for example, but quite often, just ‘normal’ conversations, little exchanges between friends, parents and children, conversations which are not about very much, nothing there to suggest that something deep and profound is coming. And that is what may catch you out in Normal People; because it is precisely those moments, moments where the characters try to articulate with difficulty, with lots of ‘I don’t know’, and ‘um’, something about themselves, so deep and profound that it’s hard to put in words, hard to communicate to others. It’s perhaps things that they would rather not have to admit about themselves (such as Connell’s desire to fit in), or things that hurt badly (such as Marianne’s prone-ness to submission). Things that one might perhaps try to say casually, without thinking, but only because it hurts so much to think about for more than a milli-second.The strength of the book, its exquisite strength, is that beneath these ‘normal’ conversations, these ‘um’ and ‘I don’t know’s, Rooney makes you hear those profound and intimate things that other writers would take paragraphs of careful, sometimes ponderous, prose to put across. And yet, Rooney does not do what lesser writers do. She never resorts to the cheap tricks of the profession. She constantly keeps those two characters in sight (and a few others but the emphasis is on Marianne and Connell), switching from present tense to past tense almost imperceptibly (and the present tense in narrative is not easy to pull off), focusing on their inner development (which for the most part of the book feels like no development at all but an endless return of the same, only with the roles changed). For example, in the beginning it is Connell who is at ease, socially masterful and comfortable in his own skin; this changes with Marianne being the socially capable one later on. Yet, at no point does this oscillation feel like a redemption as in superficial narratives of self-realisation. Even in the end, there is no final catharsis, but only a small movement which manages, slowly and with setbacks, to break from the initial position of the two characters (their weaknesses, their longing, their desire for conformity) towards something more authentic and more satisfying.Needless to say, I’m giving the book 5 stars. Not only that, I would like to urge those of you who haven’t read it so far to take the plunge. Maybe you’ll feel like I felt the first time I tried to read it. Hopefully, you won’t. I’m more than happy to discuss this book with those who have already read it or those who will read it soon."
115,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76202320-henk,Rating 5 out of 5,"Gripping and perfectly capturing the feeling of being human in the now, and being young specifically“Young people these days, I can’t get my head around your relationships”Setting and general feelConnell Waldron and Marianne Sheridan both feel so alive and real. We are spirited away to Carricklea, a small town on the Irish countryside and meet these characters in small chapters. Sally Rooney puts focus on pivotal moments in the life of our young characters, who are moving from high school to university and beyond. The technique of painting a scene, flashback and then some rounded conclusion, sometimes felt a bit like a trick, andRooney applies an interesting non-use of quotation marks that is very distinctive. But I found Normal People to be a near perfect read, driving me to follow Connell and Marianne as soon as I could through the book.That is not to say that Normal People is a happy book or that Marianne and Connell are sympathetic characters persé. At times I wanted to slap both of them, and thought with myself: Why don’t these people talk instead of everytime assuming someone doesn’t want to make true what they say at night and how the hell does that translate to: “I guess you’ll want to see other people, then, will you?Reflecting on ConnellHe started telling her that he loved her. It just happened, like drawing your hand back when you touch something hot.Clearly there is a struggle at high school between being popular and being authentic, and the importance you place on opinions of other people when you are young is something Rooney takes on very eloquently and sharp. For instance in respect to a classmate she let's Connell think the following:... to be thought well of, to be a person of status. He would have betrayed any confidence, any kindness, for the promise of social acceptance.And Connell is true and fair enough to realise this applies to himself as well, and that morally, fundamentally he might be a weaker character than Marianne.High school Connell says he wants to be a good person but is he, really? He tends to chooses easy, explainable, in line with what’s expected.Maybe I am a bit to independent minded but I honestly can’t remember ever doing anything to be liked by my peers. Superiors like teachers, yes, at times, but peers? I couldn’t care less if they’d like me, as long as I was better the them in some area. But then, I always was irrevocably different so blending in to be liked was not an option anyway. Still the depiction of the struggle at the heart of Connell was done so well and articulate by Rooney, for instance: If anything, his personality seemed like something external to himself, managed by opinions of others, rather than anything he individually did or produced.In ways Connell seems to be rather irredeemable, even his mother Lorraine feels that way.In Trinity College (because both characters are intelligent, casually illustrated by them discussing the The Communist Manifesto, “He told her she should try reading The Communist Manifesto, he thought she would like it, and he offered to write down the title for her so she wouldn’t forget.”, yet intelligence clearly does not equal happiness), the configuration changes. Connell and his social background make him a loner. He heavily dissociates from his surroundings, culminating in him attending a literary event where he thinks of his fellow students: They were attended only by people who wanted to be the kind of people who attended them.All this clashes profoundly with Marianne, who was bullied, kind of oblivious and unphased at school and apparently successful at university. This offers a full role reversal in terms of popularity.Thinking of MarianneThe cup in Marianne’s hand is too hot to hold, but instead of placing it down again she just let the pain seep into her fingers, down into her flesh.Marianne knows Connell because he is the son of the housekeeper. Her struggles are both in the mind but also in terms of class. Already Connell thinks: That’s money, the substance that makes the world real. There’s something so corrupt and sexy about it.But her social status is coupled with casual domestic abuse, a dead father and bullying at both school and at home. All in all this leads her ending up in masochistic situations where she thinks:He tells her bad things about herself. It’s hard to know if Marianne likes to hear these things; she desires to hear them, but she’s conscious by now of being able to desire in some sense what she does not want.There’s always been something inside of her that men have wanted to dominate, and their desire for domination can look so much like attraction, even love.For better or worse they are both chained to each other and don't seem to be able to come loose from each other. Also Connell has issues, struggles with expressing himself and defining himself against male stereotypes and expectations, and falls in a depression:He was like a freezer item that had thawed too quickly on the outside and was melting everywhere, while the inside was still frozen solid. Somehow he was expressing more emotion than at any time in his life before, while simultaneously feeling less, feeling nothing.The two together are more than one plus one, and Normal People is more than just cleverAll in all it is surprisingly hard to define what makes Normal People so good. It is poignant, it is very much attuned to the now (with people struggling with anxiety, the financial crisis as background and gender relations under tension) but in the end it is before all else a love story. Not a happily ever after kind of love story, not a traditional one persé, that's for sure, but absolutely compelling. I want to close with two passages that Rooney inserts at the end, capturing the unique way your youth can change the course of your life for better and worse:It’s funny the decisions you make because you like someone, he says, and then your whole life is different. I think we’re at that weird age where life can change a lot from small decisions. But you’ve been a very good influence on me overall, like I definitely am a better person now, I think. Thanks to you.All these years they’ve been like two little plants sharing the same plot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions. But in the end she has done something for him, she’s made a new life possible, and she can always feel good about that.Initial observation when I was done with Normal PeopleReview to come but the last chapter made me smile so hard in public transport and almost cry. So good!"

I have been hearing great things about Sally Rooney since her name got a number of glowing recommendations in last year's end-of-year reviews, but I only got round to reading her first novel Conversations with Friends last week. I was impressed by that, so my expectations for this one were very high.I found the first couple of chapters a little flat, but once the characters were established, the rest of the book became a compelling read, and I couldn't resist finishing the whole book in a single day. Like Conversations With Friends, this one is at heart a love story, but it is far from being a sentimental romance.At the start of the book in 2011 (a time of economic depression after the ""Celtic Tiger"" boom), Marianne is a loner, an outcast in her final year at school from a rich (and as becomes clear later abusive) family in a small town in Mayo. Connell is the son of their cleaner (a young single mother), and a popular star of the school football team. Both are very intelligent, and they develop a clandestine relationship. Marianne persuades Connell to follow her to Trinity College in Dublin, where most of the rest of the book is set over a four year period. In Dublin their roles are reversed - Marianne finds friends quickly but Connell finds it difficult due to class snobbery.Their relationship is a complex one, and the book explores their inner worlds intensely, and like Conversations with Friends this takes them to some pretty dark places - Marianne has a masochistic streak and is attracted to sadistic bullies, while Connell escapes his depression to find some redemption as a writer (which allows Rooney to make some playfully acerbic comments about the literary world). As in Conversations with Friends the second half of the book is darker and deeper than the first, and the ending has an element of ambiguity.The writing is sharp and witty throughout, and Rooney's ability to inhabit her characters is very impressive. This book is definitely worthy of shortlisting, and could yet be a potential Booker winner."

Connell is a popular, handsome, and highly intelligent secondary school student who begins a relationship with the unpopular, intimidating yet equally intelligent Marianne, whose mother employs Connell's mother as a cleaner. Connell keeps the affair a secret from school friends out of shame, but ends up attending Trinity with Marianne after the summer and reconciling. Well-off Marianne blossoms at university, becoming pretty and popular, while Connell struggles for the first time in his life to fit in properly with his peers. The pair weave in and out of each other's lives across their university years, developing an intense bond that brings to light the traumas and insecurities that make them both who they are.عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «آدم‌های عادی»؛ «آدم‌های معمولی»؛ «ما آدم‌های معمولی»؛ نویسنده: سالی رونی؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز یازدهم ماه سپتامبر سال 2020میلادیعنوان: آدم‌های عادی؛ نویسنده: سالی رونی؛ مترجم: الهام فیاضی؛ تهران : نشر جمهوری‏‫، ‏‫‬1399؛ در 272ص؛ شابک 9786004680417؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایرلند - سده 21معنوان: آدم‌های معمولی؛ نویسنده: سالی رونی؛ مترجم: ساره ارض پیما؛ تهران، کتاب کوچه، 1398، در 200ص؛ شابک 9786006974637؛عنوان: آدم‌های معمولی؛ نویسنده: سالی رونی؛ مترجم: مریم نفیسی‌راد؛ کرج، شانی، 1399، در 519ص؛ شابک 9786003725874؛ عنوان: ما آدم‌های معمولی؛ نویسنده: سالی رونی؛ مترجم: شبنم موتابی؛ تهران، نشر خزه، 1398، در 259ص؛ شابک 9786229562550؛رمان «مردم عادی» را، «سالی رونی» نویسنده ی «ایرلندی»، در سال 2018میلادی منتشر کردند؛ این کتاب دومین اثر ایشان، پس از کتاب نخست ایشان، با نام «صحبت با دوستان (2017میلادی)» است، این رمان در «آمریکا» پرفروش شد، و در چهار ماه نخست انتشار، بیش از شصت و چهار هزار نسخه چاپی آن، به فروش رفت، در ماه آوریل سال 2020میلادی نیز، مجموعه تلویزیونی موفقی با همین نام، روی آنتن رفت؛ این رمان در فهرست جایزه ی «من بوکر 2018میلادی» آمد، به عنوان کتاب سال «واتراستون 2018میلادی» به آن رای داده شد، و در مراسم جوایز کتاب «کاستا 2018میلادی»، برنده بخش «بهترین رمان» شد؛ در سال 2019میلادی نام آن در فهرست جایزه ی ادبیات داستانی زنان آمد، همان سال از سوی «گاردین» در میان یکصد کتاب برتر سده ی بیست و یکم میلادی رتبه بیست و پنج را، از آن خود کرد، رسانه‌های «ایرلند» آن را، اثری مجادله برانگیز خواندند، و به این نکته اشاره داشتند که «رونی» مارکسیست استداستان «آدم‌های معمولی» خیلی ساده آغاز می‌شود، «کانل» در را می‌زند و «ماریان» که هنوز لباس‌های مدرسه را به تن دار‌د در را باز می‌کند، «کانل» وارد منزل می‌ش��د و از مادرش که خدمتکار خانواده‌ است می‌خواهد که بر‌‌وند، دیالوگ‌های معمولی رد‌وبدل می‌شود و اطلاعاتی به خوانشگر داده می‌شود که با دو آدم باهوش و مستعد سروکار دارد، «لورین» می‌گوید که کار دارد و از آشپزخانه بیرون می‌رود، «کانل» و «ماریان» تنها می‌مانند و با هم سخن می‌گویند، «ماریان» به «کانل» می‌گوید که از او خوشش می‌آید، «کانل» متعجب می‌شود، «لورین» برمی‌گردد، «کانل» بی‌خداحافظی می‌رود، «لورین» به او تشر می‌زند و «کانل» هم خداحافظی سرسری‌ می‌کند، کم‌کم این دو بیشتر همدیگر را دیدار می‌کنند، «کانل» به منزل «ماریان» می‌آید تا کتابی را از او قرض بگیرد و علاقه‌ شان اگر بشود نام علاقه بر آن گذاشت جرقه می‌خوردنقل از متن: («کانل» باید در اتاق انتظار، پرسشنامه را پر کند، صندلی‌های به رنگ روشن، دور میز، جلو مبلی چیده شده‌ اند، که اسـباب بازی، روی آن تلنبار شده است؛ پایه‌ های میز، بسیار کوتاهند، و «کانل» نمی‌تواند روی آن خم شود، و از آن به‌ عنوان زیردستی استفاده کند؛ در نتیجه با حالت معذب برگه‌ها را، روی پای خود می‌گذارد، و پرسش‌ها را پاسخ می‌دهد، با نوک تیز خودکار، دقیقاً سئوال اول را سوراخ می‌کند...؛ و ردّ یک پارگی کوچک روی کاغذ به‌جا می‌ماند، «کانل» سرش را بالا می‌گیرد، و به متصدی نگاه می‌کند، که پرسش‌نامه‌ها را برایش آورد، از آن‌جایی که حواس زن بـه «کانل» نیست، باز نگاهـش را بـه برگه می‌اندازد؛ سئوال دوم به «بدبین بودن» اشاره می‌کند.)؛ پایانتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 20/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

Mi è piaciuto soprattutto grazie allo stile dell'autrice: sì io sono una di quelle lettrici che ""meno è meglio"".Però l'ho trovato un po' prolisso, pur essendo molto corto, non so se ci fosse veramente bisogno di 200 pagine di tira e molla. Forse un racconto sarebbe bastato.In tutto questo, in questa recensione di Persone Normali non voglio parlare di Persone Normali, ma dei lettori.Persone Normali mi ha fatto pensare al fatto che la gente cambia drasticamente il suo modo di leggere a seconda di come i libri sono presentati. Persone Normali è, in modo abbastanza diffuso riconosciuto come un buon libro, eppure:Nella prima parte, scuole superiori, il libro è perfettamente sovrapponibile con uno YA, sia per tematiche che per profondità. Eppure lo YA è considerato a furor di popolo universalmente inferiore.Nella sua totalità sono duecento pagine di due che si mettono insieme e si lasciano, si mettono insieme e si lasciano, si mettono insieme e si lasciano. Sì certo sto bellamente ignorando tutta la parte di analisi delle relazioni, introspezione e blablabla. Ricordiamo che il libro mi è piaciuto.Ma comunque, in soldoni, è come un romance in cui la parte della crisi viene ripetuta 5 o 6 volte. Anche nei romance non mancano riflessioni sulle dinamiche di coppia. Eppure viene considerato universalmente inferiore.Con questo non voglio associare Persone Normali né ad uno YA né ad un romance. Perché non è nessuno dei due. Dico solo che se i lettori fossero un pochino più flessibili mentalmente troverebbero letture soddisfacenti ovunque.O, perlomeno, ci sarebbe molta meno spocchia.Grazie, torno a leggere YA e romance ora."

Instagram || Threads || Facebook || Amazon || TikTokThis is my first Sally Rooney book and I wasn't really sure what to expect since she seems to be the kind of author that people either love or hate. NORMAL PEOPLE is a coming of age story set in the 2010s that follows Connell and Marianne, first as high school students from opposite ends of the social strata, and then as adults who are trying to navigate their increasingly unsatisfying and fucked-up lives.I thought this book was really good. It reminded me of the depressed counter-cultural lady-lit that was popular in the early 2000s, which is maybe why reading it felt so nostalgic. But it's entirely character driven and pretty depressing, so unless reading about two moody and horny people avoid happiness like that little ship dodging the aliens in Space Invaders has any sort of appeal to you, I might not recommend this book. Luckily, I happened to be in the mood for literary-lite.I'll probably read more from this author.4 stars"
120,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2922102-blaine,Rating 5 out of 5,"All these years, they’ve been like two little plants sharing the same plot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions.Connell is a popular athlete from the working class whose mother works for Marianne’s family. Marianne comes from wealth, but treated as a pariah at school and is psychologically abused by her mother and brother. In their last year of school before they both leave for Trinity College, Connell and Marianne begin a secret relationship that’s both sexual and deeply emotional. The book traces, over the next five years, their complicated relationship.In the wrong hands, Normal People could have been a bad YA novel. Instead, this book is truly excellent. Connell and Marianne are damaged yet completely believable characters. They are fully realized and exquisitely detailed, even though we rarely see them apart from each other. They hurt each other—casually and deliberately—and date other people, but they slowly learn to be better to one another. I was completely drawn in to this story; I was happy when Connell and Marianne were together, and frustrated when they drifted apart.Ms. Rooney is a gifted writer, and Normal People will only further cement her reputation as perhaps the best young fiction writer today. One hundred years from now, I believe people will read this book—and see reflections of their own relationships in it—the same way that today’s readers are still drawn to classic novels like  Pride and Prejudice and  Wuthering Heights. A future classic, and an absolute must read."
121,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher,Rating 2 out of 5,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me, says Marianne. I don’t know why I can’t be like normal people.Normal People is a 21st century remake of Mork and Mindy, but with the genders of the main characters reversed, played out over four different series.Marianne plays the Mork character. She is an alien from the planet Entitled Marxist Millennial, bemused by the strange habits of the earth creatures she encounters at school.Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn’t know if she would ever find out where it was and become part of it.For example:Joanna's a citizen of a country Marianne has never visited, the country of paid employment. Marianne replaces the yoghurt pot in the freezer now and asks Joanna if she finds it strange, to be paid for her hours at work – to exchange, in other words, blocks of her extremely limited time on this earth for the human invention known as money.Connell is her one earth friend and eventually partner, but rather devoid of any personality.And if there were any other characters, then like the TV series, I've already forgotten them.The second and third series - the middle two quarters of the novel - rather loses its way. In a too-obvious plot twist at University Mork Marianne, from her more privileged background, becomes more at home there, and Mindy Connell feels alienated as the working-class hick from the sticks. (is Trinity College, Dublin really like this as Cambridge wasn't? and does anyone actually study there as they don't seem to in the book?)But this premise isn't really sustained - not least as the author is keen to remind us frequently that Marianne is not like normal people. A change of scene to inter-railing in series 3 doesn't really help, so to produce the contractual number of episodes/pages, the author resorts to an awful lot of he-said-she-said-is-she-really-going-out-with-him padding as well as lots of tedious detail for no apparent reason. A typically riveting passage reads:When Jamie’s story is finished, Marianne goes inside and comes back out again with another bottle of sparkling wine, and one bottle of red. Niall starts unwrapping the wire on the first bottle and Marianne hands Connell a corkscrew. Peggy starts clearing away people’s plates. Connell unpeels the foil from the top of the bottle as Jamie leans over and says something to Marianne. He sinks the screw into the cork and twists it downwards. Peggy takes his plate away and stacks it with the others.As Marianne notes, recreating the feeling of this half of the novel:It’s nothing worse than this mostly, it’s just this all the time, nothing but this, and long empty weekdays wiping down surfaces and wringing damp sponges into the sink.I must admit I was quite struggling what the literary point was. But in the rather stronger last quarter, Rooney has Connell answer that question. In a rather odd mental rant, he decides that book readings, but seemingly much of literary fiction generally, is:culture as class performance, literature fetishised for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they might afterwards feel superior to the uneducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about. Even if the writer himself was a good person, and even if his book really was insightful, all books were ultimately marketed as status symbols, and all writers participated to some degree in this marketing. Presumably this was how the industry made money. Literature, in the way it appeared at these public readings, had no potential as a form of resistance to anything.On the last 'resistance' point, Rooney's confessed political agenda is rather suppressed in the novel - indeed she has her characters realise that marching in Dublin against the situation in Gaza isn't really going to change anything either.But her literary aim seems to be the opposite of what Connell condemns - to write light literary fiction for people who would otherwise not read it, and, to be fair, on those terms she has succeeded and I suspect this will be an important book for many readers. The fact that I personally found the book dull is more my lack of interest in the millennial subject matter - but it didn't feel that the book worked to create that interest. It felt aimed at readers who wanted to see their/people they know's experience reflected on the page, rather than explaining millennials to those not from their planet.Normal People has had a lot of award success, but the success it has had is telling.  Not even mentioned in dispatches for the Goldsmiths.  One of the oddities on the Booker longlist, in an attempt to widen the award’s appeal, but, as with its fellows Snap and the graphic novel, correctly ditched for the shortlist.  And now longlisted for the Women’s Prize. My brother Gumble's Yard has often pointed out that:One of its strengths of this prize is the ability every year to combine on the same longlist, relatively lightweight and enjoyable fiction (to attract more casual readers) alongside experimental or challenging books (to introduce the same readers to new literary experiences).and in a way Rooney ticks both boxes in one novel. Winner of the Costa, but more a successor to Eleanor Oliphant than Reservoir 13. Inevitably winner of the Waterstones “What will sell best for Christmas” Book of the Year, succeeding (another?) YA/crossover novel. And Winner of a British Book Awards alongside the aforementioned Snap and Eleanor Oliphant.The fourth quarter/series, that brings the characters back to their hometown and the story to a close, is, as I mentioned, rather more successful and packs more of an emotional punch.But, just like last year’s equivalent Eleanor Oliphant, some genuine pathos in the closing third is rather marred by a Hollywood/box-set ending. The last episode manages the best trick of both delivering a happy ending -  hooray Marianne is a normal person and she and Thingy are together at last - and then add a late development that sets this all up nicely for a spin-off sequel.    But I won't be watching it.The worst thing about this book - it makes me feel an old curmudgeon. I thought this take said what I wanted to say perfectly:You only need to look at the kind of books being lauded at the moment to see how simple-minded they are.” “What’s now regarded as serious literature would, 10 or 20 years ago, have been regarded as young-adult fiction. I read a few pages of the Sally Rooney book. It may say things that millennials want to hear reflected back at them, but it’s very simple stuff with no literary ambition that I can see.”“I don’t mean to be overly critical, but in terms of literary history, it does seem a bit of a regression”And that means ... I've turned into Will Self!"
122,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19736308-susan-s-reviews,Rating 4 out of 5,"Well! I picked this book up when it first came out, and after reading a few chapters, I quickly put it down again. Some books need to come to me when I'm ready for them. This week, I was finally ready for this intelligent, beautifully written, but tortured tale. It left me mentally and emotionally exhausted.Although I enjoyed this novel on the whole, the boomerang relationship was getting a bit tiresome after a while - hence the four star rating. Would these two mixed up kids ever figure themselves out, I kept asking myself? What's up with all of this miscommunication? They love one another, but they can't find a way to ""say it like it is"" and stay together? They both had ""issues"" that kept tripping them up - often quite unnecessarily, in my opinion. For me, this was a major weakness - that the break ups were sometimes a bit contrived and easily avoided but for a simple word or two. Two high scoring students like Connell and Marianne are incapable of recognizing what they had? They are that emotionally immature? (Well, yes, I guess so, otherwise this would have been a very short novel!) I also found it very interesting that the sheer beauty of Rooney's writing (and the potentially dreary ending) elevated what would essentially have been your average romance novel into literary fiction. (It even spawned a pretty decent adaptation on Hulu.) Interesting how each of the characters realize at one point or another that they don't feel lonely when they are together. I loathe the expression ""s/he completes me"" but I guess that they each provided something the other needed to feel right in this world. And just when things FINALLY seem to be going right for them, Connell gets that opportunity of a lifetime (no spoilers here!) Once again, they face a difficult choice. Marianne realizes that they have been good for one another and have helped each other to get to this point where they can visualize accepting ""inopportune"" opportunities to further their careers. Spoiler Alert: Big debate on the internet: Does Connell take the MFA scholarship and leave for a year? I think he does, eventually, agree to accept the scholarship, but I also believe that he will, inevitably, return to Marianne after he completes his degree. She herself admits that he will be a different person when he returns, but that is not a bad thing. She wants to see him grow into a stronger person, overcome his depression and make full use of his talents. Connell and Marianne support one another now. And who is to say that Marianne won't make good use of the time apart for her own self-development? The last line in the novel is very telling, in my opinion: ""You should go, she says. I’ll always be here. You know that."" And yes, that has always been true of Marianne and Connell. Whatever amount of time, distance or misunderstandings the plot threw at them to separate them, they always found their way back to one another. (Hey, maybe this separation will force them to generate their own set of ""Edna St. Vincent Millay calibre"" love letters which will be published posthumously - because of course Connell will have been awarded the Pulitzer or the Man Booker Prize in recompense for all of this suffering and existential angst!) What can I say: I'm an eternal optimist!!! By the way, just because he was granted a scholarship does not mean he gets fast-tracked for a student visa to the US. So this little detour in their lives isn't going to happen right away, although it is presented this way in the novel. And where is Connell going to get the money for the plane tickets to the US, much less the cost of the fees to even apply for a student visa? Details, details, I know, but, logistically, Connell might not even be able to take advantage of the spectacular out of the blue offer. N.B. I just read an article about the author and Connell appears to closely resemble Sally Rooney (re intelligence/life choices, etc.). Marianne's ""submissive"" nature is also something the author wrote an article about in her early career - a bit of over-sharing that she now regrets. Hmm, as Connell would say! I get that some people are really into BDSM but - personally - I can't fathom ever wanting to willingly inflict pain on anyone as an act of love or passion. I think I may be a tad too empathetic: to this day I still feel guilty about the annoying fly I swatted when I was twelve years old: it lost a wing then fell between the cracks of the stairs I was sitting on before I could put the poor thing out of its misery. So, sorry, this aspect of Marianne's character just made me feel sad for her, that she needed to be dominated in this way in order to feel pleasure or love. But if that is what makes you happy.... I guess? Not for me, so maybe keep this in mind when you read this review. My rating: a 3.8 out of 5 because of the stellar writing style."
123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek,Rating 1 out of 5,"I very rarely think that a book is worth just one star, but I just could not stand Normal People. With all the praise thrown at it from all directions I realize that I'm obviously swimming against the current with my remarks, but so be it - this is one of the most boring and overrated novels that I have had the dubious pleasure of reading in recent years.Normal People is the story of Connel and Marianne, an unlikely pair - he's the well-liked son of a single cleaning woman, she's the unpopular loner that comes from a rich family - and, as you probably expect, their relationship won't be like that of other ""normal people"". Not because they both come from vastly different social backgrounds - the notion of class divide is only barely hinted on and never explored, and later thrown out of the window altogether. We're never shown why Connel and Marianne can't be together - they themselves obviously care for one another, and make it clear several times throughout the text. They can't have a normal relationship not because they're not ""normal people"" and have some inherent flaws that make it impossible, but because the author doesn't want them to have a normal relationship.Essentially, Connel and Marianne are the equivalent of Facebook's it's complicated. Why exactly is it complicated? I don't know, and apparently neither does Sally Rooney. Her characters clearly care for each other, but somehow are unable to commit to one another - which doesn't stop them from committing to others. She tells us how they act, but never shows us why they act the way they do. There are some themes that could have led to a deeper understanding of their motivation and its lack - such as the subject of domestic abuse - but these are only rudimentary, and seem thrown into the book as a sort of a lazy excuse for character building. The author could have easily swapped the protagonists' social backgrounds and their familial relations, and nothing would have changed. While reading, at times I felt like Normal People was almost exploitative, and perhaps it was. Both major characters have their own personal problems (other characters make small appearances in the book, but they're so thinly sketched they're not even really worth mentioning), but ultimately they never grow. Sure, they move to other places and behave in different ways, but it's not growth, it's what the author tells us happened. We've never shown why Marianne is suddenly popular, and how Connel is a genius, but are instead told that they are, and that's it. Of course we could have two characters who repeat their mistakes and in the end learn from their failure to progress - but in this novel these characters are nothing more than puppets on the author's string, and behave in inexplicable ways because they were ordered to do so by their master.But worst of all, Normal People commits the cardinal sin of all fiction: it's just boring. Sally Rooney delights in describing mundane aspects of Connel and Marianne's lives in detail, but lacked to create anything that would make their lives truly interesting and make us want to be a fly on their walls. The book just plods along, slowly, very slowly, and those who make it to the end will feel disappointed when they reach a very unsatisfying non-ending. To sum this up, this is one of these books that I cannot recommend. It doesn't feel like a genuine, complete novel; more like an outline of what Rooney intended to write. At some point Marianne asks ""Why can't we be like normal people?"", and that's what I wondered as well - but sadly, this novel will not answer that question."

I cared so deeply for Sally Rooney's two young lovers, and was gobsmacked by how beautiful each and every sentence was. There was also an authenticity of emotion that was palpable, and constantly left me nodding my head in recognition. This has to be one of the most extraordinary love stories I have ever read."

Comprei imediatamente por mais de R$ 50 reais, que dor! Mas valeu cada centavo... e que pena que não tenha lido antes. Assim como ""Conversas Entre Amigos"", outro livro da Sally que amei, essa historia é sobre nada demais.. é só sobre a vida de 2 jovens tão diferentes, mas tão parecidos. Acompanha a interação deles num espaço de quase 5 anos. Cada capítulo o livro avança algumas semanas ou meses e você vai vendo os encontros e desencontros, e como os 2 são tão problemáticos e, exatamente por isso, tão normais. Eu não estava nem aí pro final, nem para o que iria acontecer, eu só queria acompanhar esses 2 personagens pela vida toda... =( É perfeito até a última palavra."

It's definitely a book I will re-read in the future.The writing was stunning, Sally Rooney really did capture the essence of growing up and the dynamics shifting between school and university so brilliantly. My only issue was with the formatting of the speech, it was sometimes unclear what was actually said out loud and what was thought.I absolutely loved the two protagonists. They had such different fleshed out personality yet remained so loveable to me. I really loved the way their relationship develops in the book and some of the scenes in here broke my heart. I wanted to hate Connell, because at times he was a massive idiot ,but he genuinely didn't mean to be. He was a loveable idiot. I also loved the fact that his behaviour was explicitly called out for being wrong and there was clear communication!!!I also enjoyed the depiction of two very different family dynamics in this story, at times being hard to read but ultimately giving amazing insight into where these characters have adapted from.It did a great job of discussing coming of age, not fitting in, grief, sexuality and a whole host of other topics with tender authenticity. I really loved this book."

“I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know why I can’t be like normal people.”
Back in the times of B.C. (that’s “before children” for all of you not familiar) on the occasional Saturday I would venture out to a little place . . . . . 

Where super artsy fartsy films (generally with subtitles) were shown. Sticky floors, stale popcorn, crackling/backfeed-filled speakers, grainy film quality and movies no one else had ever heard which resulted in about five people max in the seats. My idea of paradise. Normal People is the literary equivalent of the type of film that would be shown there. Not big budget, no bells and whistles, no all-star cast and certainly no butterflies and rainbows. Shortlisted for the Booker Prize, Normal People is a different sort of romance as you follow Connell and Marianne and their ever-morphing relationship from childhood through adulthood. Simply put . . . . .

And the tale is a bit of a chicken and egg regarding whether they were always destined to be that way or became more so as their dysfunctional relationship evolved.Don’t let the “deeply political” or “will make you cry” taglines scare you off - this book is phenomenal. Many thankings to my buddy Sam (and more importantly his 5 Star “oh-my-lort-that’s-like-seeing-a-unicorn-in-real-life rating) for helping propel this to the top of Mount TBR."
131,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 4 out of 5,"I was not very generous with my review of Conversations with Friends, which was Sally Rooney’s previous novel. But I must admit that I liked this one a whole lot more. Rooney really gets into the heads of her characters. Her novels are angsty and introspective. I couldn’t relate to the characters in Conversations with Friends, and I just couldn’t get interested in their inner turmoil and interpersonal dynamics. But the characters in Normal People interested me far more. The story focuses on Marianne and Connell. It starts when they are teenagers in a small town in western Ireland, and it follows them to university in Dublin. They are both complex characters, whose efforts to communicate and connect keep misfiring. They come from different class backgrounds and have very different family lives — both factors that play a big role in who they are and how they connect and don’t connect. Rooney’s writing seems effortless, yet she conveys a lot through few words and brief interactions. Because of the age of the characters, at times the novel felt like sophisticated YA fiction — which is not a criticism as far as I’m concerned, but it might be a turn off for readers who like more mature characters. I’m glad I gave Rooney another try. I’ll be looking forward to her next book. Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy."

Connell and Marianne are teens attending the same school and appear they don’t know each other, but they do. Connell’s mom works at Marianne’s house. The two could not be more different. Connell is a popular athlete, while Marianne is a loner. The following year they are attending Trinity College. This time around, Marianne is the social one, and Connell has become shy and uncomfortable in his new social surroundings. Connell and Marianne begin a dance. They drift apart and circle around each other, but often are brought right back together. At one point, each are veering off-path, and they have to decide if it’s worth coming together to save the other. The writing here is my favorite, spare and intentional. There’s so much to analyze in the class differences, first loves, friendship and family dynamics explored here with nuanced skill. Overall, this story took me so many places emotionally. I have to admit I was a bit spent by the end, but I think that illustrates how invested I was. The biggest messages are centered around being young and in love, and this is executed so well, with so much tenderness and care, so smart, that I fell in love with these characters and their story.

Normally, I would DNF something I wasn't enjoying, but I've been wanting to branch out more in my reading tastes and I told myself I would see this one through. I was curious to see if the ending would be unexpectedly stellar since it ended up on so many best of lists in 2019 (spoiler alert, it wasn't). I feel like I read a completely different book than everyone else. The two positives that I have to share are 1) I enjoyed the method of storytelling. Each chapter started with a bit of a time jump and after seeing where the characters are now, we would flashback and get filled in on things we missed off page as if they were happening in real time. And 2) there were some interesting observations about adolescence throughout, but that's where my pros end. I found this to be extremely boring. I didn't like either character and I was never rooting for their relationship. A lot of their interactions felt very matter of fact, and I just couldn't get into their story. The lack of plot led to a lack of motivation for me to pick up and continue reading but I pushed through (my friends can attest to my text complaints during this experience). I also thought a lot of the side characters (with the exception of Connell's mom) were severely underdeveloped. I feel awful saying it, but this was truly a waste of my time and will no doubt be on my worst books of 2020 list."

I never related to a book so hard. There were many lines in here that were striking. One in particular left me speechless because it expressed a feeling I have had for years but have not been able to put into words. So obviously I loved this book and the more I ponder it the more I love it. The ending actually made me angry and even more so because of personal reasons to my own life experiences. I know very well what feelings those characters were experiencing and that’s what made the ending that much more infuriating.

Normal People essentially provides what the title would suggest, and yet, in this deep observation of two people Rooney manages to capture something of what it means to grow up, what it means to feel untethered and in love and lost and much more. Her style is astute and thoughtful, but never descends into dramatics for effect. This is not a gripping book, at least it wasn't for me, but it was a book that I don't think I'll forget very soon. The characters seemed real and I felt for them in they vulnerability and cringed for them when I saw them sabotaging themselves.

138,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20351546-karluis,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is ""the best novel published this year"" (The Times)? This is the work of the ""best young novelist"" Olivia Laing has read in years (Guardian)? You've got to be kidding me. At best, the prose in this universally-fêted novel discloses very occasional flashes of brilliance (as when Rooney writes, simply and astoundingly, ""Behind her eyelids waves of light move in green and red""). At worst, however, it is clunky, incoherent, and in desperate need of incisive editing. Take this line at p 131 (2018 paperback edition) for example: Connell stares at her across the table, simply allowing his face to express the alarm he feels at this remark. Quare: How exactly, pray tell, do you allow your face to express alarm? The last time I checked, feeling alarmed is an instinctive, involuntary emotional response, not a mental state one can have any control over. A few pages later, Rooney/the narrator tells us, ""She's smiling, a tired and self-hating smile"": the problem here is that instead of allowing us, as readers, to see or infer for ourselves what happens on the surface and/or what pulses underneath, we are, in effect, told what to see and feel. This is 
not
 an isolated example. In p 74, for example, Rooney/the narrator tells us that ""For a while [Connell] tried to get over it by drinking too much ... He was excruciatingly lonely"" – again, we are told that this is how Connell felt, instead of being allowed to see or infer for ourselves that he felt the way he did. Again—and I am simply flipping to random pages—at p 124, we are told (again) that ""Finally, in a voice that struck him as truly cold, Marianne said: Sure."" Again, at the risk of belabouring the point, instead of allowing the reader to feel first-hand how Marianne's tone must have sounded to Connell, we are expressly told how Connell perceived Marianne's tone of voice. This is lazy writing par excellence. Apart from such technical squabbles, I couldn't care less for Marianne and Connell, who both seemed to indulge in endless navel-gazing and appear to think highly of themselves. Please – they are as normal as normal white teenagers/young adults can be. And let's not even go into how zero-dimensional, laughably clichéd, and pitifully reductive all the rest of the characters were.To think that some consider Rooney to be a worthy successor to the hallowed Irish tradition of letters represented by James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Oscar Wilde, W.B. Yeats, and Seamus Heaney – what baloney."

It is a little bit of a different writing style that I'm used to but oh what a storyteller Sally Rooney turned out to be!I feel like the less you know about this book, the better it is. It is the story of Connell and Marianne. They grow up in rural Ireland and go to school together. He is a poor boy and she is a rich girl. It is not quite a romance but more of a character study of a relationship. The story is told over several years. I really could not put it down. It's quite emotional and heartbreaking at times and perhaps a little painful. While the ending is a touch bittersweet or undetermined, I feel it was the perfect ending to this story.Thank-you to NetGalley and Penguin Random House Canada for granting me the opportunity to read this Advance Reader Copy."

I mean, I started this with zero expectations; if it wasn't for the cover and title that grabbed my attention, I would've never read Normal People. I probably wouldn't have heard of it, to be honest. I'm not sure what possessed me to read it so quickly after buying it either. I have hundreds of books to read, and yet, I chose to read this one first.It must've been some sort of fate, because this was so incredible; so entirely different from what I normally read; so raw and realistic ... phenomenal.The characters in this are all broken and lost, but in their own individual ways. It's hard not to connect to at least one character/storyline, or to look at one and think, ""I know/knew someone like that."" The whole Connell and Marianne tug and pull relationship was almost too painful for me to watch unfold. And while I am pleased with how the novel ended, I'm also upset, because I'm sure that tug and pull with continue on forever. That's just their strange dynamic. Sad. Detached. Two lonely and lost people trying to find their way. Also, for those of you who don't know, this book is written without quotations when characters speak; however, don't let that discourage you. I wasn't too fond of it at first, but I realized I didn't notice it around chapter three.I highly recommend this one! Especially for those who may feel lost or discouraged within their life; I think there are more people who feel that way than most realize. Don't feel like that doesn't make you ""normal."" You're more normal than you know."

”People are a lot more knowable than they think they are.”
I was prepared to not like this book. I kept delaying reading this for so long sure that it won’t be something I’d actually like, but guess what? I guess did. It was one of the most frustrating books with really frustrating characters! It made me angry at times and frustrated and exhausted at others. I might not have actually liked the characters, but I guess I was interested in them??I really liked this book with all its messiness, all its complications, and all its issues. I totally understands all the mixed reviews. I’m not even sure why I liked that book that much when I hate everything about it. From the miscommunication and all the misunderstanding to how toxic the relationship seems to me.Yet I find myself engaged in their stories, wanting to know what’s going to happen next (even though I know things are gonna go down again) and don’t even get me started on the writing. I read the first page and I noticed the lack of quotation marks and I’m like wait what?? But I found myself opening the book again and actually enjoying the writing? The author just got a way with words, I think.Anyways, as those weird indecisive characters, I found myself unable to properly express my feelings towards this book."

“Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything,”

Normal People is one of those books that made a huge success and has more than half a million ratings on GR. I just can’t help it when it comes to those books and I want to understand why are they very successful. With this one, I failed to see this reason!Maybe the TV show helped getting the attention of more readers but I think it was developed because readers found it interesting to start with (It is like a cycle). When I finished this one I went immediately to GR to check the ratings and reviews and it kind of made me feel less weird because among the top reviews, there were plenty of negative ones that I related to. I understand that it is a polarizing story and that readers will either love or hate it (me belonging to the latter group unfortunately) but still I can’t understand the hype it got.I recently read that everything boils down to marketing these days, the shows we watch, the books we read, the food we eat and I am saying this because I think this book had such great marketing that contributed to its huge success.

“Most people go through their whole lives, without ever really feeling that close with anyone.”

For me, it was just a love story of two young adults, Marianne and Connell, I think there are elements thrown to make it look like a deep story but they made it pretentious. I recently read Conversations with Friends by the same author and there were a lot of common things between the stories: people falling in love with the wrong people, people smoking for no good reason, the absence of quotation marks which at this point I believe Rooney don’t know the rules of so she said fuck it and got rid of them all together (I tried to find a deeper meaning to this but really couldn’t since it is a thing in her two books and mostly in her upcoming book), people discussing my region’s politics to sound politically correct, using mails when clearly there are more advanced ways of communication. Also Marxism because the author is a communist.There are a few things here like an abusive family which I found two dimensional and read YA books with a better representation of this. There are time jumps with each chapter which made the flow clumsy in my opinion.

“Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn’t know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it.”

I think I will stop the review here just because there are a lot of people who did not enjoy the book too and wrote more eloquent reviews. I saw reviews criticizing the writing, the editing, the characters and I almost agree with them all. I think it is just not a book for me.Summary: Unfortunately, I did not understand the hype with this one. I think the story is very simple and has been done before in a better way, the characters are not relatable and the editing is less than average. It is a polarizing book and you will need to try it to see whether it is for you or not!"
144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1128612-pattymacdotcomma,Rating 4 out of 5,"4★“Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn’t know if she would ever find out where it was and become part of it. She had that feeling in school often, but it wasn’t accompanied by any specific images of what the real life might look or feel like. All she knew was that when it started, she wouldn’t need to imagine it anymore.”Marianne and Connell – this is their story. As schoolkids, he’s the popular guy and she’s the outsider. Exceptionally bright and a bit of a loner with a sharp tongue, she obviously rubs her classmates the wrong way. She also comes from a wealthy family, so she’s a misfit.Connell is also exceptionally smart, but he’s more of a go-with-the-flow kind of guy who kind of admires Marianne’s outspokenness but would never admit it. His family lives in the poorer part of town, and his mother cleans house for Marianne’s mother. When he comes to pick up his mum from work, he and Marianne often bump into each other outside of their normal school situation. They find they do have a lot in common and form a private relationship without letting anyone else know about it. ‘Being alone with her is like opening a door away from normal life and then closing it behind him.”They have an intense connection, but it’s not public, as it would be with normal people. Marianne’s considered weird, and Connell’s a sports hero, so high school kids might consider him weird, too. “Marianne’s classmates all seem to like school so much and find it normal. To dress in the same uniform every day, to comply at all times with arbitrary rules, to be scrutinised and monitored for misbehaviour, this is normal to them.”Connell is questioned by a friend who knows Connell’s mother is a cleaner for Marianne’s mother and asks “What’s she like in her natural habitat?”, as if she’s some alien species. So Connell never talks to Marianne at school – never even acknowledges her presence.“He carried the secret around like something large and hot, like an overfull tray of hot drinks that he had to carry everywhere and never spill.”The story moves on through their lives, with a long section while they are at the same university, Trinity College, Dublin, where Marianne is more in her element. She’s smart, witty, and her classmates there have caught up with her, so to speak. Connell has no sports reputation to fall back on, but he loves English and literature and is anxious to mix with others who feel likewise. Unfortunately, his classmates are shallow and superficial, unlike Marianne.“At times he has the sensation that he and Marianne are like figure-skaters, improvising their discussions so adeptly and in such perfect synchronisation that it surprises them both.” I think Rooney’s done a great job at describing the conflict going on in each of their minds and the misunderstandings and the unspoken ‘understandings’ (we won’t look at each other at school). I certainly recognised the dynamic and the people, the loners, the outsiders, the kids who have to wait for their classmates to mature to appreciate them for who they are.The growing up and moving in different circles of friends keeps pulling Marianne and Connell apart, and their old bond stretches to breaking point. But it does snap back together every now and then, and it’s frustrating to see life get in their way. As Marianne gets older, she starts to feel ‘special’, and I think she liked flaunting her new public popularity in front of Connell. Who wouldn’t? She also seems to have become more physically attractive as the book goes on. It's not ugly duckling to swan, but there is some element of that. I see this as appealing to a lot of young readers, coming-of-age readers and those whose school experiences are still real and raw. I wasn’t invested enough in either Marianne or Connell for this to be a special read, but I can see how others might think so and put it on the Booker longlist."
145,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18643650-mark-porton,Rating 5 out of 5,"Normal People by Sally Rooney ended up being, quite simply….Exhausting.This character based story follows a couple of 18-20 year olds (Marianne and Connell) from the final year of high school to college/university. Sounds simple, possibly light hearted even.Well, this is a really heavy story. It started off as a fairly teeny/coming of age romance and then progressed to a complicated, messy, frustrating story – in other words, a relationship endured by many so-called ‘normal people’.Both characters, were very likeable – I found myself rooting for them, hoping they would both be okay. But they acted in ways that were frustrating and even unconscionable at times – particularly one of them (in my view). My God, I wish I read this in a book club – there is so much to discuss and argue about. I could only discuss this with my Pup and he (bless him) couldn’t quite grasp some of the themes and nuances presented by Rooney in this book.There were some uncomfortable situations in this story, encompassing such things as domestic violence and sadomasochism in relationships. One thing that made me squirm and toss and turn whilst I was reading this in bed was the main characters inability to communicate exactly what they wanted in a relationship. This is a constant theme here, we all have done this, or currently do this. Why don’t we say exactly what we would like, what our expectations are from our partners or the relationship? It is so easy to judge this as an observer, but when we are in the ‘thick of it’ we often don’t. Consequences are often severe. Missed opportunities, wasted time, collateral damage/impacts (other relationships).Really, I’ve said nothing here (I feel) but it is all I can say, my emotional attachment to this story and its characters started off as small as a Green Pea, graduated to a Basketball about half-way through and then to an avalanche of Boulders at the end. The author has done so much with so little here.Maybe I’m gushing too much, but this is my first Rooney story and it won’t be my last. 5 stars"

Ten eerste verander je zelf in twee mensen: wie jij toen was en wie jij nu bent. Je zit terug op school en je leert de sportieve, populaire Connell kennen en het (volgens sommigen, maar niet volgens Connell) lelijke eendje Marianne. Je gaat nadenken hoe het toen op school ging. Hoe probeerde jij je tot anderen te verhouden? Kon het je niet schelen dat je een outsider was, of hengelde je juist naar aandacht? Tijdens het lezen check je hoe jij als achttienjarige was, en hoe je zelf toen op Connell of Marianne zou gereageerd hebben.Ten tweede is het haast onvermijdelijk dat je ook Connell of Marianne wordt. Om de beurt vertellen ze (op een magistrale manier die je moet ontdekken) over hoe ze zich in de loop van een paar jaar tot elkaar hebben verhouden. Je kunt niet zeggen dat ze een relatie hebben, maar toch weer wel. Elk hoofdstuk maakt een tijdsprong, en binnen elk hoofdstuk houdt Sally Rooney het ook spannend door op een ingenieuze manier eerst nog niet, maar later wél te vertellen wat er ondertussen is gebeurd. Naarmate de tijd vordert, wordt je betrokkenheid groter en gaat alles meer knellen, jeuken, schuren.De schrijfster is de koningin van de body language. Wat zegt een mondhoek, een wenkbrauw, een trekkend spiertje, een handbeweging van niks? ‘Normale mensen’ gaat over min of meer normale mensen, maar Rooney slaagt er op een geweldige manier in om ze buitengewoon en onvergetelijk te maken.‘Normale mensen’ is uit het Engels vertaald door Gerda Baardman."

I mean yes I get it, she had it really, really hard at home and it fucked up with her head but what she needed was a frickin therapy not another abusive sexual relationship. And what upset me more is that her depression isn't explained, she's still pretty fked up at the end I think the writer could've done better than this.Connell character is the same for me. He is weak I get it, his anxiety and depression got the best of him and I do feel sorry for him that he wanted to help Marianne but he never understood her (same feeling bro) but the way he treated Marianne in some parts, even when he knew how vulnerable she felt around him, and how he threw the ""I love you"" like it's nothing, kind of an arrogant ass if you ask me. Still, in some weird, messed up way they loved each other. I want to write more how I feel about them but I'll just messed up the review given that I still can't wrap my head around how their relationship worked (or not). I think, I'll have a better understanding of this book at some point of my life, but today isn't that day."
150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53624059-claire-reads-books,Rating 5 out of 5,"3/24/23: I re-read this on a whim and was so impressed with it. Truly…a modern classic! There have been so many “For fans of Normal People…” novels in the last 5 years that I had forgotten what the original text was actually like. I so admire Sally Rooney’s economic and efficient storytelling…every sentence really counts (and trying to annotate that kind of book is a losing battle). On first read, Connell was the character I found myself tuning into, and while I still find Rooney’s depiction of his journey from popular small-town kid to alienated student at an elite university nearly perfect, on second read, Marianne’s story was the one that struck me most. I didn’t really understand her the first time around and found her arc to be melodramatic and indulgent on Rooney’s part…this time, it felt much more true, perhaps because I’m a little older and wiser now than I was at 25. I also (spoiler alert!) remember feeling pretty assured they’d stay together after the end of the book, but this time around…I’m actually not so sure! But I’m not worried about the two of them, either way. **9/19/18: ""Normal People"" has the heat, tenderness, and satisfaction of a great romance novel, and then some. This is a book that believes in soul mates but rejects fantasy, embracing the conventions of the romance genre while transcending them with Sally Rooney's much-praised literary eloquence and keen social perceptions. Come for the Man Booker hype, stay for all the irony, intensity, and all-consuming ambiguity of young millennial love."

“Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything,”

 I'm not going to lie... the only reason I picked this book up was because I watched (and loved) the Hulu series. The book followed the series really well. Probably one of the closest book to tv adaptations I've seen. Personally, I like the show just a bit better. You can feel the on-screen chemistry of Connell and Marianne. I enjoyed the book and tv series so much! I recommend them both."
152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111513919-gabriel,Rating 3 out of 5,"Si te gusta el romance y encima tóxico pero muy realista. Adelante, este libro es para ti.Gente normal es una historia para pasar el rato, es de esas que me entretuvo y me gustó pero hasta ahí. Lo bueno es que te la puedes leer en un día o dos si tienes el tiempo y la disponibilidad suficiente. La historia es sobre Marianne y Connell, dos personas que son como el agua y el aceite pero a la vez no tanto. La popularidad, las clases sociales, los intereses y los amigos que tienen es uno de las muchas cosas que los separan y los llevan a interactuar con un muro de por medio, pero curiosamente son esas mismas cosas las que han logrado de alguna forma unirlos y reencontrarlos una y otra vez. Sin embargo, nada es imposible y por cosas de la vida empiezan una relación que solo los llevará por una espiral tremendamente caótica y tóxica en exceso. Ahora, los personajes me parecieron un esbozo, pude entender porqué son así más no logré conectar porque el estilo de la autora es muy simplista y directo, sin embargo, lo que sí compro es el concepto y la estructura del libro. Primero, con estructura me refiero a que la historia da muchísimos saltos en el tiempo, todo el rato está brincando de un hecho a otro con una notoria diferencia de meses, por lo que se puede sentir como un rompecabezas; una historia formada por varias acontecimientos que dan forma a la vida de los protagonistas.Y con el concepto me refiero al tema en el que rota la historia, el cual es el amor, pero un amor imperfecto que viene de dos personas igual de rotas y negligentes para saber comunicarse las cosas a la cara y exponer sus pensamientos y emociones con claridad. Son unos idiotas a la quinta potencia que viven danzando en un bucle infinito que parece no tener fin durante meses y años; inician una relación, la dejan a medias, regresan nuevamente y otra vez se alejan. Así se la pasan todo el tiempo. Esta historia no romantiza pero sí expone crudamente las inseguridades, la dependencia y codependencia, los celos, la posesividad, la falta de sinceridad con una buena y sana comunicación para que una relación funcione. Y todo eso tiene un desencandente que tiene que ver con las familias que detonan en ese tipo de personalidades cerradas, distantes e inseguras, que a la mínima de cambio en una relación solo sirven para recibir y causar daño al otro. La historia se mete en otros temas y problemáticas que para mí se quedan de por sí muy por encima, demasiado superficial para mi gusto. Si se hubiera centrado solo en ellos y no en las otras cosas que orbitan a su alrededor me hubiera gustado más.Ahora sí, por otro lado, lo malo de haber leído el libro este año es que me parece tan inferior comparado con la adaptación televisiva que le hicieron, la cual vi en su mismo año de estreno y de la que tengo recuerdos tan vívidos que me temo este libro no sustenta ni llena los huecos que ha dejado en mí. Creo que allí se manejó excelentemente los silencios y esa incomunicación por los personajes, además de que los actores interpretan muy bien esas escenas límites en las que ya no pueden cargar con tanto y quedan al borde de una crisis de desesperanza, tristeza y mucha desesperación. La serie la sentí más a tono porque si bien prima a los personajes tampoco olvida dar ambientación de lo que sucede exteriormente a lo que están sintiendo por dentro; con eso me refiero a los gestos, las expresiones, el lenguaje corporal. No sé, a lo mejor y no es necesario la comparativa pero sí creo que para ser dos productos diferentes y con una narrativa que no se acerca, me encantó y me transmitió muchísimo más la serie que el libro ."

155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74388656-human,Rating 2 out of 5,"(2.5/5)What the what did I just listen to. Someone please, make it make sense.Normal People follows Marianne Sheridan and Connell Waldron over the years as their lives and stories loop and tangle with one another. Originally from the same town, the novel jumps through time to express major interactions between the main characters, who find themselves brought back together time and time again.Honestly, the only reason I read this was that so many people were quite literally losing their shit over this book, and I wanted to know what was so special about it that entailed the hype, as well as a TV show adaptation. And while I'm still being honest here, I'm going to say that I didn't really get it.I think that the first thing I need to mention is that I listened to this book rather than reading it in a text form. The narrator was alright, no complaints there, but having heard from others about the infamous lack of quotation marks in this book, I'm quite relieved that I decided to listen to this book rather than read it.Now, there were some solid aspects to this book that I actually enjoyed. I liked the way that Rooney presented as well as discussed certain issues that are very prevalent, but never made it seem like some sort of ideology was being shoved through your ears and into your head. Important questions were raised and ideas were brought up in a tasteful manner.That being said, however, there wasn't much plot to speak of, seeing as to how this was a mostly character-driven novel. I normally wouldn't have had a problem with this, except for the part where I found the characters lukewarm and lacking, and their relationship even more so.There's no doubt that the characters have issues and problems that they are dealing with, Marianne in particular, that are separate and similar at the same time. However, I never felt like there was any development or change in them - they weren't especially moving or compelling. I didn't feel much for them other than concern.This was true even more so regarding their tumultuous relationship. Don't get me wrong - I certainly thought it was interesting to see how they were still tied together after so many years and such different choices, and how they had kept finding each other despite the differences in their lifestyles - but I never really rooted for their relationship, even in the beginning.Tbh, the last thing either of them needs is a relationship, the first being therapy.The ending of this book, however, might just be the most underwhelming part of it all. I remember in the part leading right up to the last few chapters feeling somewhat anxious and dreadful about what was to happen and the ""explosion"", for lack of a better term, that was no doubt to follow.Instead, as the end credits played and the audiobook ended, I found myself disappointed. I had been expecting to cry, mostly from what the synopsis told me, but more than that, I had been expecting the characters and their lives and their actions to move me. Hell, I was expecting more from that ending just by how it had been set up as the scene for something grand.But no :D :D :DI was let down by the ending, but the book as a whole had not been that ✨amazing✨ to me in the first place. If you were somehow able to enjoy this, then I'm glad for you, but honestly, I don't think this was for me. I didn't enjoy it much, but I didn't particularly hate it much either, so I'm left feeling pretty inconclusive about this book. It was, in a word, mediocre."

Y en ese tiempo, narrado con saltos temporales que crean en el lector un ansia por devorar cada pieza de información que pueda explicar lo sucedido, no sólo crece el vínculo sino que crecen ellos. El camino a la madurez como resultado de la apertura al mundo con sus exigencias, dolencias, pérdidas y oportunidades da lugar a un audaz, franco y efectivo retrato de juventud que captura especialmente la incertidumbre y los vacíos que caracterizan a una generación sin eludir lo esencial que resulta en la definición de nuestra perspectiva de dicho mundo, tanto como en la definición de nosotros mismos, la mirada y voz de aquellos a quienes estamos tan intrínsecamente ligados."
159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100118640-dwayne,Rating 5 out of 5,"So I get why some don't like this, but I have to say that I loved it so so much. I wasn't expecting a romantic drama, and usually, that's not a genre I’m interested in, but I was hooked after the first few pages. Rooney writes economically, (superfluous quotations be damned) always getting right to the point of how her characters feel, even if their actions aren't always explained. There’s no plot; instead, our two lead characters are followed as they shift in and out of each other's lives over a period of about 4 years. I hardly find ""it has no plot"" to be a criticism- it's my belief a book doesn't need the mechanics of plot for it to be good or enjoyable. If you like plot, though, this may not be the book for you. With that said, I loved the structure of the story; it moves linearly with a few flashbacks here and there, and even when Marianne and Connell made messy or annoying decisions, (or quite frankly, decisions I did not understand) I still cared enough for them to continue reading. I haven't seen the TV adaptation, so I can't yet make a comparison, but this feels like the type of book people will still be talking about in ten years.4.5 stars"

”Marianne,” he said, “I’m not a religious person but I do think sometimes God made you for me.”
this book was one of the shittiest things i've ever read. that says alot bc the shit that i've seen on wattpad is something else. it’s so disappointing knowing i went in fully expecting to love this book and just lucking out. i was expecting a sad literary masterpiece and instead i got a shitty story that went nowhere. it wasn’t even sad! if anything, i found the ending to be pathetic. i honestly thought it’d improve but it went downhill with every flaw i found. but i’m definitely watching the show now that i’ve read the book!back to my review.. this book was such a red flag!! i honestly didn’t like the “realistic” aspect of this book bc if i were marianne i wouldn’t let connell treat me the way he did!! i refuse to believe that there are ppl out there letting men degrade them and seeing themself as little worth compared to a man. it was so sad to see that connell chose his social status over the person he loved.i immediently got weird vibes a few chapters in. there's this one line that really pissed me off where a bartender looks at marianne's boobs and it says she feels a thrill of feminity. i honestly could not stand this book bc it feels as though it went against the moral standards by painting out women to be lower class than men. I thought this shit was over!! thrill is literally used in happy context so i don’t like the idea that this book is suggesting that being a women means enjoying men looking at ur private parts.i found this story to be super weird with the realistic aspect. connell was barely considered popular but for some reason ppl like him? sure, the idea of this book seemed realistic in the beginning but it just became worse and worse. honestly i didn’t like the way the story was executed but to top it off the writing wasn’t it either!! it was like a series of bumps left and right as i kept reading.spoilers ahead from this point oni don’t like how easily marianne forgave connell for belittling her I’m order to keep his social status. the moment she’s the popular one all is forgotten!! i found them to both be awkward and i couldn’t see any attraction between them. it seemed as though they had different levels of humor and i never understood how they were able to put up with each other? i truly expected more from them.i really thought marianne would change. but instead she became a fucking sadist/masochist and let other men degrade and control her. she even showed that she didn't like being tied up when lucas did it but she likes other men doing it?!?! please explain ur reasoning marianne. not to mention she took ""im not like other girls"" to a WHOLE new meaning. she was the type of fmc where she embraced being different which i admired but i feel like she showed me that there are worse ppl than others who “aren’t like other girls”.i get the idea is that they can never truly be separated from one another and will always find their way back but in all honestly i feel like connell was always using marianne whether it was intentional or not. he saw her as an object rather than a person. marianne was such a fucking pushover and she never stood up for herself basically!! i feel like connell never ever deserved marianne. i never even learned they were friends w benefits until they officially announced it..?? what the actual fuck.the friends w benefits dynamic caused them to always have misunderstandings and it was the root of their problems. i feel like at the end of the book connell was perfectly ready to be with her and finally choose her but she had to go and ruin that. no matter if he would’ve come back, she should’ve seized the chance to be fucking happy!! they were some of the most confusing ppl that i have ever read abt.honestly i get that she's “setting him free” at the end to make his own decision but the way she continued to let connell control her at the end showed absolutely no character development with these people. she wouldn't even communicate!! with!! him!!! she chose to let another man get what he wants rather than telling him what she wanted when he literally said to tell him if she didn't want to. it is an act of selflessness but at this point she just seemed to let him go to spite him in a way?? idk but she was the weakest fmc ive ever read abt.anyways i am DEFINITELY returning this book. what a waste of money imo..! it's so disappointing bc i was so excited js to be let down for this shitty book. i don't think i'll ever be reading another sally rooney book if all of them are like this."

I mean, it just felt so random, and it was sort of weird and I didn’t really get the point of it? Maybe I’m not old enough to get it or something, which is perfectly possible, but it really was just a love story that was written in a weird way and with a bit more drama and time jumps than usual, and that was about it. I dunno, I just wasn’t really able to get into it, especially on a deeper level. I know people have called it draining, or emotional to read, and in a sense, it wasn’t that for me frankly. I’m not saying it is a bad book necessarily as I absolutely see the appeal of it, but I found it to be a bit odd.It sort of did throw me off as there are not an speech marks and everything is narrated, which I guess in an interesting choice to tell a novel. I’ve definitely read novel that are more narration heavy, but never a novel that was solely told through narration. Like, I actually enjoy reading dialogue(though I would also hate it if there was an abundance of it) and I felt that I couldn’t properly connect with what the characters were saying most of the time. I eventually got used to it, but I just think that because of it, I wasn’t able to become fully immersed with the writing style, which was a shame. Again, it’s not that it wasn’t good, but on a personally level, I wasn’t able to connect with it as much as I wanted to.Also, the number of times the phrase ‘normal people’ was repeated started to get quite repetitious. I do generally like when the title of the book is used within the novel itself, but only to a certain extent and it was just way too overused here. A couple of times, great, being used like more than once a chapter, yeah, a bit much thanks.I suppose the characters were fine, but I simply didn’t feel too connected to any of them here. There are certainly interesting enough individuals to follow but for some reason I just wasn’t really emotionally invested in any of them. I don’t feel the scattered time jumps really helped as in my view it made the story feel disjointed and as the jumps were sometimes like 6, 7 months at a time, it was difficult seeing it as one unified story but rather more like a connected series of snippets in these characters’ lives. I do suppose considering the time covered, I don’t see how the author could have changed that and made it flow smoother. I think as someone used to reading YA and fantasy, and less so literary fiction, I’m not used to it, and having this book not work for me could be due to my inexperience with the genre, which I feel is completely fair. I was sort of confused with the plot and the ending was so lacklustre and anticlimactic. In a sense, it is just normal people living normal lives, going to school, getting into relationships and that’s about it. I’m not saying it was boring, everyday lives are incredibly interesting things to read about but I also do wish that it had a bit more direction instead of just a series of sporadic events. Look, I suppose that is life, random things coming at you, but I feel like normal everyday life doesn’t always work in a novel like this. I’m incredibly conflicted as I totally get what the author was going for and I really appreciate what this novel does, but at the same time, I felt that it wasn’t really for me. So unfortunately, I didn’t like this as much as I wanted to as I have heard amazing things about it, but hey, I’m just a normal person and that is what happens sometimes. 4.5/10"

This book is less than 300 pages, yet I feel like I read an 800 page book, it was exhausting.I can see why some people love it, and I did enjoy some parts of it, but mostly I felt bored reading it. Some chapters contained the most irrelevant information, the pacing was all over the place (I HATED all the time jumps) and the romance lacked depth. I couldn't feel the romantic connection and I think one of the reasons I didn't enjoy this as much as everyone else was because of the romance. It took up too much space and didn't convince me at all. In a way, I can believe that Marianne and Connell loved each other, but I didn't feel the connection. I didn't like their dynamic - Marianne would have killed herself if Connell had asked her to, and he knew that, he knew how much power he had over her and yet he continued to use and abuse it. The chapters when they were in college were so boring and I honestly think they made each other's lives worse.What I liked most about this story was how real and raw it was. The mental health issues, the class discussions, the miscommunication, the friendships and romances, the pains of growing up - it was all very realistic. I found myself relating to both Marianne and Connell, although at times it made me feel really bad because I thought to myself ""they're pathetic"", which made me feel pathetic for relating to them. I know it sounds chaotic, I'm very confused about it.Most of the time I felt kind of apathetic when I was reading it, I don't have any strong feelings about the story or the characters. And I don't care how realistic the ending is, I hated it because I hate open endings.This is my second Sally Rooney book and it will probably be my last.“I'm not a religious person but I do sometimes think God made you for me.” - this quote is EVERYWHERE, I’m sure everyone has seen it.

He’s amused at himself, getting wrapped up in the drama of novels like that. It feels intellectually unserious to concern himself with fictional people marrying one another. But there it is: literature moves him. One of his professors calls it “the pleasure of being touched by great art.” As I read that line, a wave of understanding washed over me. In this short passage, Sally Rooney is describing how one of our main characters, Connell, feels while reading Emma by Jane Austen. A book that I hadn’t read before reading Normal People, but I had after. As I re-read Normal People, after reading Emma, I felt a bond form between me and Connell. As if our mutual adoration for literature linked us together. The way Sally Rooney describes his feelings towards the characters in Emma, is not only how I feel about them also, but how I feel about Connell (and Marianne) as a fictional character himself. That’s the uncanny truth of this book, it feels real. As if Connell and Marianne were alive as I write this now. As if the events of this book truly happened. As if I was there with them through it all. In a way I was there, just as Connell, in a way, was there with Emma and Mr. Knightley. Sally Rooney explains it perfectly, literature moves us. Connell’s professor is right also in calling it “the pleasure of being touched by great art.” And aren’t we incredibly lucky to feel those things for people who don’t even exist in the flesh, but exist in the soul. Earlier in the book, Connell and Marianne are talking while he is holding a copy of The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin. She asks if his friends knew that he read so much. “They wouldn’t be interested in that stuff, he said.” and Marianne replies, “You mean they’re not interested in the world around them.” Her response left me in awe. Again, she felt so real to me in that moment. By the fact that she (and he) is/are passionate about racism, and have read books which are so applicable to today. Getting book recommendations from your favorite characters is probably one of the greatest things on earth. I will now proceed to get myself a copy of The Fire Next Time, and many other books referenced in Normal People. This book doesn’t just tell you a story, it gives you a look into people’s souls. The beauty, pain, and truth of life, are captured within these pages. I often feel certain emotions that I honestly don’t know how to explain or put into words. Sometimes I think that maybe I’m alone in feeling them. There were multiple times while re-reading this book when I thought, Yes! That’s exactly how I feel! Sally Rooney has given voice to emotions I’ve never known how to articulate. So, when she says that “literature moves him,” I would like to say it back to her, Your words move me!First read May 28-29th 2019I read this in less than 24 hours, and if it wasn't for sleep I would have finished it in one sitting!!! That in itself says a lot about this book and Sally Rooney as an author. To capture a reader and pull them so deeply into a story is quite a magical power. This book was incredibly character driven, but in the best way. I didn't feel like it was lacking a plot because of my attachment to the characters. Connell and Marianne felt so real, like I could almost say I knew them personally. Their relationship and miscommunication frustrated me at times, as it feels when you see a friend go through difficulties in life and relationships. I wanted to pull them out of the book, sit them down and say, ""Guys, let's talk this all out."" With that being said, each character had a valid reason for why they acted or reacted in that way. They were each so well developed, and the setting of Ireland felt so real eventhough I've never been there. As you can tell, I adored this book with my entire heart and soul!! I knew I was going to love this book and Sally Rooney as a writer. I can't wait to read her debut novel ""Conversations With Friend's""!!! I'm gladly adding this superb story onto my all time favorite books list!! 💕"

What we have here is anything but normal.To be honest I started this book years ago, but abandoned it. When the book was recently donated to my LFL, I decided to try again and read it. So…I started reading it about a week ago, and found myself more interested. I finally finished it this morning.I am now bringing my review to Goodreads.Premise: Marianne Sheridan and Connell Waldron meet as teens in County Sligo, Ireland. Both are star students, but Marianne is an outcast raised in material wealth and emotional poverty by her widowed mother, who has dealt with aggressive behavior from men – including her abusive late husband and nasty son. Lower-middle-class Connell lives across town with his unwed mother, who had him in her teens and works as a cleaning woman for the Sheridans. Marianne and Connell begin an intense, private, complicated, don’t-tell-anyone-we-are-in-a-relationship. As readers, we follow them over a 4-year period. Connell is concerned about his social standing if anyone should discover his involvement with Marianne. Marianne could care less what anyone thinks of her. As readers, we are witness to their on-again-off-again closeness (sex) and misunderstandings and insecurities. Throughout the story, the author gives us glimpses into issues of class, privilege, passivity, submission, emotional and physical pain, kindness, depression, and sibling abuse (Alan, the brother, towards Marianne). Her focus is on young adults as they struggle to navigate their lives – coming into themselves and the world around them. There were some scenes that were difficult to read. (Especially between Alan and Marianne.)The author’s use of dialogue sometimes cut to the heart. She seamlessly integrates well-crafted texts, emails, and even FB posts into her narratives. Still…I wasn’t sure what I wanted for this pair. I found myself lamenting…What is really best for them?The ending. (No spoilers from me.) But… Was the ending satisfying?An interesting read. Far from feel-good. But…Was it worth your time? I am still feeling strange about this book."
173,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9549139-kyle,Rating 2 out of 5,"Actual rating: 1.5 (rounded up)This is a quiet, intimate, and ultimately frustrating novel about two people: Marianne and Connell. And that’s it. The simple premise is a relief; Here are two young folk who develop a relationship, and an intense thread connects their bond through the years. It leaves so much room for the characters to blossom and deepen organically as the story progresses—and the depth sings! It’s really beautifully done. From the first few pages, you already feel like you know these two (or think you do). I don’t know what kind of witchcraft Sally Rooney pulled, but I was under her spell from the get-go! I was swiftly all-in on wherever they went; I was immediately invested in Connell and Marianne. LOL, I wrote this when I was barely 10% through.Just to get it out of the way: I thought Connell at the start was a bit of (how shall I put this?)... a pussy. He’s the typical heterosexual male jock on the surface, but sensitive and intelligent underneath. He buries the softer parts of himself—hiding his relationship and desires from his friends and schoolmates in an effort to protect his social standing (I guess?). I thought he had very banal opinions and ideals about women, school, society, etc. Marianne deserved better than someone so... basic! He says he doesn’t like sex, but seems to have a lot of it, too? *People Marianne deserves more than Connell: Karen and Lorraine.* I don’t remember when in the story their characters started becoming these tortured, emotionally damaged, melancholic drips, but I can say that with 100% certainty that it ruined the book for me.It bugged me how easily the two fell back in with each other time and time again. I guess I’ll never truly understand love—if you could even call their unhealthy, problematic “relationship” anything resembling love—if forgiving is that simple? Maybe they’re just better at being “adults” than I am, which makes me feel odd, being at least a decade older than their characters. Marianne’s actions were entirely pathetic, though. I was completely let down by how she acted around Connell, no matter how pitiful his position (Can you tell I hold grudges?). I don’t see why it had to be so difficult for them to communicate their feelings with each other properly. All of their arguments, break-ups, and generally poor friendship were caused by miscommunication; Something always got misconstrued or lost in translation, and they just fell away from one another. This is frustrating the first go around, but when it happens every single time, I just wanted to scream at Connell and Marianne, “OPEN YOUR MOUTHS AND SAY WHAT YOU MEAN!”Their entire cycle throughout the book was: sex, angst, break-up, sex, angst, break-up, angst, sex, angst, and more sex... and I mean, really... I was actually put off by how much goddamn sex was in this book! I’m no prude (honest) but, like, where’s the fucking story?!?!? There’s lots of sexually-charged dialogue, BDSM, Connell randomly wanting to “slip inside her”... None of it was romantic to me. At all. Their intimacy is best explored through their more quiet and deep conversations, not their constantly fucking one another. And then the whole story, I mean... it just sort of fizzles out at the end. It concludes on such a whimper of a note, and I’m actually angry.*Why two stars instead of one, you may be wondering? Well, I know many folks on here were put off by the writing style, but I actually enjoyed it. It was clean and neat and read well.*So, to conclude: You had me at the start, Sally Rooney, I’ll give you that, but then you lost me quicker than Usain Bolt on amphetamines. What a major letdown."

While the one above sums up the story better, I feel like this one captures the characters so well.I think I've grown a very large love for books that don't make sense. I love that being confused makes me think so much more about what I'm either reading or listening to. In this case, listening. And what an incredible audiobook it was. Connell and Marianne come from two different social circles. Marianne has money and Connell does not, and that seems to be an ongoing theme throughout the entire story. The difference in work ethic compared to being ""handed things"" and the way both ways of thinking change their trajectories. It was interesting and compelling and absolutely mind blowing at times how well Sally Rooney wrote that in. Even so far as to have Marianna mention it at one point. How maybe it's ignorant of her to not even think of the different circumstances they're in.Their dynamic as well, he constantly feels as though he needs to have her spell things out for him when it comes to the future of their relationship while she needs him to take ownership of her because of the way she grew up. It's such an ongoing issue, and just when you think it gets solved, another miscommunication comes about. Even to the very end.This was incredible writing, incredible story-telling, and I loved it. I think although ominous, it couldn't have ended any better than it did. It felt so real. Because our choices really do affect such a large part of our lives, and to be left unknowing about their next choices...It feels so real. So... normal. - Paige"

176,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59033840-althea,Rating 3 out of 5,"damn. This book put me through a lot and I let it.This book basically follows these two people who have known each other since they were young and we see glimpses of their relationship at different points whenever they meet over the years. That's it. That really is the only thing that goes on. Despite that, it wasn't the reason that I wasn't obsessed with the story by the time I finished it. I have decided that in totality, I guess I did like portions of it for what it was.This was going to be a 5 star book for the first 70% and I was completely in love but then the ending 30% was so frustrating.... I am sorry but the ending really ruined this book for me. It wasn't because I think that the story was pointless or that nothing happened but as a reader... it was just incredibly unsatisfying and, I'm going to say it again, frustrating. I don't care if it's a sad ending, I just want to feel contented.It's frustrating and it's messy, I know. And I get that this is supposed to be real life and sometimes it's just like that but... I needed something satisfying and that's not what it was. I honestly understand how this can be so polarizing to read and even until now I don't exactly know if I can say whether I like this book or want to throw it off a cliff (note: I have since changed my mind and decided that I do want to keep it on my shelf and not sink it in the ocean).All I can say is: this book lives up to its title. It's about normal people and it both balks me and has me in awe.Although it didn't really bother me, you need to give it some focus in the beginning in order to understand the story due to the lack of quotation marks and brain processing power to decipher the time skips. To be honest, I did like the format because it made the flow more natural to me. However, if you are already having a hard time getting into the story, I see how it could just add to the frustration.Marianne and Connell aren't perfect people, they frustrate each other, the people around them, me and you as the readers.... it's full of miscommunication and toxicity at times... but it's real. And it's complicated. And let's face it, that's how a lot of people are, maybe even you and me at some point in our lives and maybe people we have loved as well. But that doesn't mean that I necessarily liked how certain themes and scenarios were portrayed in this story without being given proper closures and solutions.
“Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything,”
I do stick by my earlier statement that I do not like how this book ended despite loving a majority of it. At the end of the day, I think that whether or not you like this book will depend on what you want from it. What I can tell you is that, to me, this isn’t a happy love story that made me hopeful about love… which is not my kind of story, I like to think.— 3.5 —⇢ content warnings// Abuse (physical, emotional), Alcohol use, Anxiety, Bullying, Death, Death of a parent (past), Depression, Domestic violence, Drug use, Sexual assault, Suicide ideation, Suicide, Toxic relationships, Violence "

Ve yarısına kadar da epey keyifli bir okuma deneyimi vermesine rağmen kafamda hep ""acaba keyifli ama sığ bir şey mi okuyorum?"" sorusuyla cebelleşip durdum. Normal İnsanlar'ı okuduğumu görüp, nasıl gittiğini soran herkese ne cevap vereceğimi tam bilemedim. Lise son döneminde başlayıp üniversite dönemini içini alan bir süreci anlattığı için, kitap bitince iyice fark ettim ki, Rooney epey güzel bir iş çıkarmış anlattığı şeyi biçime dönüştürme konusunda. Lise son yıllarındaki ""kendimizi tanıma ve hayata bakış"" açısından içinde bulunduğumuz sığlığı düşünürsek, kitabın ilk yarısının daha esnek ve geniş bağlarla örülü bir anlatıma sahip olması, sonra karakterlerin büyümesiyle kimlik ve benliklerini çatışmasından çıkan gerilim ve derinlikle anlatının daha sıkı örülü hale geçmesi bence harikaydı. Sınıfsal ayrımı, kimlik ve benlik inşasını, yapılandırmak için yıkıp yıkıp durmayı, geçmişin gelecekti izlerini, derinlikli ve yüzeysel ilişkileri, bu ilişkilerin kişinin dönüşümüyle nasıl şekillendiğini gayet güzel aktarabilmiş bir roman Normal İnsanlar.Ben özellikle sonlara yaklaştıkça iki baş karakter arasındaki ilişkinin basit karmaşasından, insanın kendi içinde kaybolduğundaki o zor süreçten epey etkilendim.Rooney 1991 doğumlu bir yazar ve Normal İnsanlar ikinci kitabı.

181,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,Rating 3 out of 5,"(2.5) Conversations with Friends was one of last year’s sleeper hits and a surprise favorite of mine. I was part of the official shadow panel for the Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award and was pleased to see Sally Rooney win the prize. So I jumped at the chance to read her follow-up novel, especially after it was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. It’s been earning high praise from critics and ordinary readers alike as being even better than her debut. Alas, though, I was let down.Normal People is very similar to Tender – which for some will be high praise indeed, though I never managed to finish Belinda McKeon’s novel – in that both realistically address the intimacy between a young woman and a young man during their university days and draw class and town-and-country distinctions (the latter of which might not mean much to those who are unfamiliar with Ireland).The central characters here are two loners: Marianne Sheridan, who lives in a white mansion with her distant mother and sadistic older brother Alan, and Connell Waldron, whose single mother cleans Marianne’s house. Connell doesn’t know who his father is; Marianne’s father died when she was 13, but good riddance – he hit her and her mother. Marianne and Connell start hooking up during high school in Carricklea, but Connell keeps their relationship a secret because Marianne is perceived as strange and unpopular. At Trinity College they struggle to fit in and keep falling into bed with each other even though they’re technically seeing other people.The novel, which takes place between 2011 and 2015, keeps going back and forth in time by weeks or months, jumping forward and then filling in the intervening time with flashbacks. I kept waiting for more to happen, skimming ahead to see if there would be anything more to it than drunken college parties and frank sex scenes. The answer is: not really; that’s mostly what the book is composed of.I can see what Rooney is trying to do here (she makes it plain in the next-to-last paragraph): to show how one temporary, almost accidental relationship can change the partners for the better, giving Connell the impetus to pursue writing and Marianne the confidence to believe she is lovable, just like ‘normal people’. It is appealing to see into these characters’ heads and compare what they think of themselves and each other with their awareness of what others think. But page to page it is pretty tedious, and fairly unsubtle.I was interested to learn that Rooney was writing this at the same time as Conversations, and initially intended it to be short stories. It’s possible I would have appreciated it more in that form."
182,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416888-heidi,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5. For some reason (maybe because I watched the first episode of the excellently produced series, realized it was a book and stopped watching) but I expected this to be a better than usual YA story. It is because it moves beyond the typical YA love story. So many comments I’d love to make but no spoilers here. Let me just say that for this middle-aged reader, it was a book of tense angst, with some melancholy lows and hopeful highs. But it was also very hard to read at times. I believe the further you are from your late teens, the more melancholy this story of a first real love becomes. I think back to that time in my life and there were times that my life seemed so out of my control. Now, when I do let myself relive some of those days, I’m slightly embarrassed by how emotional I was and I remember wishing I was like other people—more normal. The ever evolving love story at the center of this book is not normal. There’s pain here, there’s growing up and away here but there’s hope here too. Just not always in expected ways. I believe you’ll agree “normal” isn’t best judged by others.And that’s okay! Normal isn’t safe or staid: Maryanne May have taught me that normal is just another word for healing or acceptance.I highly recommend this book if you like a little darkness with your YA story."

The first half of this was superior to the latter half in my opinion as toward the end i found myself getting more and more frustrated with the characters although i will admit i think that was the point.This is a love story but without all of the usual frilly bits that make it romantic. The characters are deeply flawed and are generally quite unlikable. Despite initially rooting for the Connell and Marianne to end up together, by the end of the novel i perceived the couple to have a very toxic relationship and honestly just wanted them to leave each other alone. Although that all sounds very negative it was a great read and i was utterly engrossed in the story and its outcome.I felt almost nostalgic whilst reading this as i found a lot of the characters teen-hood to be similar to my own just in another country (Ireland) which i really enjoyed. I liked this and i definitely want to read more of Sally Rooney's work."

“It's funny the decisions you make because you like someone, he says, and then your whole life is different. I think we're at that weird age where life can change a lot from small decisions.”
When it comes to ambivalence, I think books like these go through them the most, sometimes even YA fans dislike them so much, on the other hand I have seen the most brutal critics rate them generously. And I’m a bit torn in between, as much as I found it relevant, in one way or another, I was baffled by a fair share of aspects as well.Say, I was baffled by Connell’s doltish decision-making, even though his sexual awkwardness is very much “normal”, and for that matter, “acceptable”(though I feel it was he who created all the problematic issues). The unusual complexity is also quite a bit astonishing…for after a while you will grow apprehensive that if everything seems alright now, brace yourself for the next devastation after, maybe a page.Also, the entire way that the pair of them weaved in and out of each other’s lives is something I find a bit hard to cope with, even if peripherally. Plus, there’s a fair bit of sadomasochism induced in copious amounts throughout the tale, especially in what Marianne had to face. You may scream that that’s unjust… 
 “She believes Marianne lacks ‘warmth’, by which she means the ability to beg for love from people who hate her.”
Nonetheless, I can’t deny that the novel is way too hard-hitting. For it is quite mercilessly (and closely) grounded on reality, and deals with issues that all of us have, or will face at some point in our lives (hopefully not, but then, life is not a bed of roses.). It won’t be unfair even to go as far as call the novel sadistic in the way it deals with everything we have to deal while coming of age. Like, struggling to fit in, miscommunications, hesitation about one’s true self, whether he or she is meant to be loved at all, desolation and finally self-destruction: these are definitely recurring themes in the perceptions of a “normal” teenager, but here Rooney went a notch deeper to extemporize a harrowing watch at the raw emotions.Even I don’t know how I ended up liking this one so much. Maybe it’s just the way Rooney writes in her unusually sombre yet sober way, that is subtle yet strikingly sharp simultaneously. Maybe because Connell and Marianne both are flawed in a convincing way, so much so that you can always regard them as the couple next door. Maybe because Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones did such a masterful job in portraying the couple in the noteworthy adaptation. Or maybe, because the story is many things but obnoxious is not one of them, (unlike most YA). Or maybe, because of the way the story leaves up a lot to ambiguity, even in the end. Perhaps the most faithful way a “normal” story like this can end.It’s definitely an extremely compelling read. Be it the way of unconventional romanticization, or the despair you are bound to feel quite a few times. But it’s better to learn to brace yourself.

186,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56035852-katie,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 stars.I'm not sure to what extent the title of this book is supposed to be ironic. The relationships are perhaps more normal than the individuals involved in them. For instance, I'm not a great fan of writers writing about writers. It seems lazy. As if they can't be bothered to research another profession. And writers, all artists, especially male artists, are notoriously more susceptible to ego than ""normal"" people. That said, the central male character here doesn't become a writer until near the end. Up until then, inspired by an inspiring single mother, he had been essentially a good guy, refreshingly free of ego and as a result understanding and sensitive. I've known a few aspiring male artists in my time and yes, they can be understanding and sensitive, they'll carry my shopping for me and open doors for me, but I've found that's because they've wanted something from me - my wholehearted approbation of their ""talent"". If I'm not passionately won over by their talent the shopping stops getting carried, the doors stop opening. So, I was disappointed Rooney makes her male character a writer. It was like she suddenly told me he was a vampire after making believe throughout the novel he was the custodian of crown jewels. Supposing, I thought, Marianne, the lead female character, doesn't like his writing? That's their relationship over no matter how compatible they are on every other level. Why couldn't Rooney have given him a profession more in keeping with the title of her novel? Normal went out the window the moment he became a writer. Normal People is a compelling love story without any trace of a hackneyed romantic soundtrack. Everything amorous happens in an ostensibly casual fashion, more like real life. The obstructions the two young people face in realising the potential of their bond more often surface from within than from outside. The self-esteem issues of Marianne were particularly well done. I found it very easy to relate with her throughout the novel. Connell, the male, was perhaps less convincing - deliberately so as the idea is he finds himself through his relationship with Marianne and will move on once he acquires a more solid sense of self. His mum, probably the most genuinely ""normal"" character in the novel, was a wonderful celebration of the unsung praises of the single mother. There were a few times when Rooney began losing me, perhaps overegging the misunderstandings, overly dramatic shifts in the balance of power and the angst but she always drew me back in quickly. It's a very easy novel to read. And rich with very eloquent insights into sexual chemistry and identity. "

They were so filled with millennial feeling angst that I thought they might explode. Their cat and mouse love story had no emotional effect on me. All I wanted was for the book to end. Class, education, love, parenting were all smushed together in a miserable knot of nothingness. I found none of the lyricism others found in her writing.

There is a bit of angst amongst relatives, and at times, amongst the groups of friends, they form. As they move on into their college years, they leave behind childhood friends and form others just as we all do.Generally, that is the rundown of the whole story, and probably against popular opinion, I found that there really wasn't much going on. I struggled to like or engage with the characters, especially Connell and Marianne who are at the heart of the story. I became frustrated with Marianne and just wanted to tell her to pull her head out of her ass and I thought Connell was a bit of a knob.

That’s the very first line of the book and the way it ended proves that their dynamic will always stay the same.Sally Rooney’s writing is absolutely exquisite.

the “romance” was a little lost on me. it’s not even really a romance? it’s a story of two people who love each other and are probably meant for each other but who have different hopes and dreams. they’re also entirely codependent. and occasionally toxic. and definitely need to figure their own shit out before they commit to each other. but we love them anyway! i just didn’t really ever see them romantically – i didn’t even really put a label on them in my head. i just loved … them, if that makes sense. which is why the ending frustrated me while simultaneously destroying me.i’ve heard a lot about sally rooney’s writing, so i think i was expecting something absolutely groundbreakingly beautiful. where the quotes live rent free in my head and i cry over just the way the story is written. i didn’t. i could appreciate the writing style because i do feel like it fit the story pretty well, but at times it did feel choppy and annoying. but really i can disregard that because we get quotes like: 

all these years, they’ve been like two little plants sharing the same plot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions.

so this delivered while also disappointing, mostly because from everything i’ve heard i expected to be one of the people who reread this every other month and rewatch the show a million times and consume every little bit that i can about anything remotely related to marianne and connell. but even though i didn’t love it that much, i did indeed love it and them and related too hard to too much of the book, and will definitely be watching the show asap. marianne and connell u will go down in history truly!!!!pre readme: “i’m putting off mp3 because i’m not ready for the emotional damage”also me: starting a different book that is going to cause severe emotional damage 🫡"

Full review is on BookNest... BookNest - Normal PeopleI was given Normal People as a gift by my parents after they watched the adaptation of this story of Sally Rooney’s. I have never read anything like this, and was not sure what to expect. But I was intrigued, and so I started it. Never did I expect that I would finish it within 48 hours and love it!Normal People really is true to the title. And that is why it is brilliant. It is a story of Normal People in realistic circumstances who have a relatable life. Marianne and Connell are the two central protagonists, from Ireland. The story begins with their college years, and then advances through their experiences throughout university. And the way their personalities develop and regress and change was amazing to read.“Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn't know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it.”This may perhaps be the most well formed romance I have read in fiction. Many novels suffer from it being forced or rushed or unnatural. But Normal People really delivered a warming and wrenching relationship that was believable and so realistic, with unexpected peaks and troughs, unique problems separating them and live presenting constant tribulations.The prose was one of the strong points of this story. As soon as I was a few pages, I was sucked in. The fluid and natural energy of the prose allowed me to glide from one page to the next, living the journey with the characters. It really was so easy to read, but at the same time made me consciously think about what was occurring. Just brilliant!“It feels powerful to him to put an experience down in words, like he's trapping it in a jar and it can never fully leave him.”The plot wasn’t grand or epic or crazy. It was real life. With some shocking events that happen to only a few people, but also the norms. The occasions and trials so many people go through. It was the manner in which the plot was delivered that made it brilliant. It wasn’t romanticised or melodramatic. It was perfect for the type of story that it is.Not only were attachments formed with the two central protagonists, but also with the supporting characters. Sally Rooney really masterfully established characters with such depth just within a manner of scenes that developed a number of layers, as every person really does. One example is Lorraine, who was one of my favourites. She has quite a small amount of time on the page, yet she is so memorable, and understandable. “Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything”Overall, I cannot do this justice. I hope I have managed to project my love and respect for this story. Along with crafting such a brilliant journey, Rooney also forms one that will linger on the mind for weeks and months to come. Even now, almost a month after finishing, I still think about specific scenes and characters and come to understand the story further.Even if this is not the usual story you would choose to read, or you don’t feel intrigued by the blurb, please just read this. I felt the same. Do yourself a favour and read this. Now I have finished reading Normal People, I will go on to watch the BBC adaptation, which is apparently equally as brilliant.I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE5/5 STARS"
197,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I thought it would never end, this book. I cannot understand its critical acclaim. As teenagers, Connell and Marianne were, at a stretch, interesting enough and witty enough and credible enough if ridiculously clever and then they left their slightly interesting Sligo town and their nasty friends to go to Trinity College where there is a little Latin and everyone is downright nasty and jaded and Connell and Marianne distinguish themselves by being cleverer then everyone else and not nasty and having lots of complicated sex with each other and entirely unconvincing relationships with other people and complex unresolved mental health issues and dark family issues and an occasional foray into class distinction. It is a ridiculous book, vacuous and vapid and self absorbed and entirely without humour or humanity or even much of a narrative thread. Sometimes, just because the book is Booker longlisted and exultantly reviewed, I read aloud bits of dialogue, to see if it might assist me locate the poetry and insights and magic other reviewers saw in it. I was flummoxed. The dialogue was less wooden, more cardboard. There were some good costume changes in it, and some gratuitous reference to books read and a mean reference to a book reading. And I got very tired of the beds and the bedrooms and the bedspreads and the colour of the wall behind the bed and...........I was very tired of the whole crowd of them before I was half way through, and it got worse before it was finished. And when it was finished, it got better. If this makes it to the Booker shortlist and Mike McCormack's 'Solar Bones' doesn't, I will..................well, I'll be very cross. "

 “I’m not a religious person but I do sometimes think God made you for me.” 
🔹  Overall feelings: 〰 I both loved it and didn’t. It’s been a few days since I’ve finished this book and I’m still having such a hard time rating it to be honest… I’ve already finished two other books besides this one but I think I really wanna review this novel and document how I felt about it (I have a feeling I’ll be wanting to read my thoughts again in a few years). That said, let’s get on with the review.🔹  The plot: 〰 This book follows Connell and Marianne over the span of a few years. We start out as they’re both seniors in high school and I think we end the novel once they get to their senior year of college. The main focus of the book is not really the romance but more so the emotional state of these characters as they navigate through life. I absolutely adored that aspect of the novel. If you didn’t know (which you definitely don’t lol), I’m actually a psychology major so best believe that I absolutely love books that explore and deal with the human psyche. I also felt like that aspect was actually well done in here. Connell’s depression and Marianne’s low self esteem coupled with her own deeply depressing state of mind made this book an unforgettable read. That said, I did not enjoy many things about this novel and since I didn’t really find other reviews mentioning the things that I hated, I thought I’d write my own review lol. 
“Sometimes I think I deserve bad things because I’m a bad person.”
 🔹  The characters: 
Marianne:
〰 Absolutely loved her. Without a doubt my favorite character in this book. From the very first page where we meet Marianne I felt deeply connected to her. I even understood her and thought her to be a very well written heroine. The abuse that she has lived with her whole life absolutely broke my heart but it definitely explained her low self esteem as well as her depression. Throughout the book, Marianne’s mental state deteriorates to the point where I’m honestly surprised that she was still able to function. Given her low self esteem, her horrifying upbringing and upsetting high school experience, it came as no surprise that she let people walk all over her. She didn’t love herself enough to be able to defend herself or even cut toxic relationships out of her life and while that frustrated many reviewers, I thought it was incredibly realistic. She honestly, truly did not love herself so having other people treat her badly didn’t really feel like a red flag to her because she genuinely never thought that she deserved better (again, very realistic since this is often how people find themselves in toxic relationships/dynamics). That said, I never blamed her for any of her actions but I was a bit disappointed in the direction that the story took when it comes to her and her personal growth, which I will get to in a minute.  “I don’t know why I can’t make people love me.”“I’ve been lonely my whole life, really.”  
Connell:
〰 I genuinely don’t think words can describe my hatred for this man. From the very first chapter to the very last one, I felt like he did not deserve Marianne. I think that over the years, we’re supposed to see how he “has grown” and how he is slowly becoming a man of his own who’s not really defined by other people’s opinions of him but the problem is that I seriously did not buy it. Connell is, without a doubt, one of the weakest characters I’ve ever read about (which, while I hated, I can still understand because a lot of people are actually like that in real life). 〰 His relationship with Marianne starts in high school and then rekindles once they’re in college. The biggest problem with their dynamic is Connell’s utter lack of self confidence when it comes to what he wants. As I said, he starts seeing Marianne in high school but insists that no one should ever know. Why? Because he is deeply ashamed of his relationship with her (that’s not me speculating by the way, he actually mentions it on multiple occasions). Marianne, while being the smartest girl in school, is also a social pariah and someone who is strongly bullied by her peers (as opposed to Connell who’s pretty popular). On top of that, she’s actually described to be quite plain and for those reasons alone, Connell is unable to tell anyone about his relationship with her. At one point, I believe that he does fall in love with her but he certainly doesn’t love her enough to stand up to his friends when they bully her or even to interfere when she gets sexually assaulted in front of him at a public school dance. 〰 That said, I might be able to forgive and even understand his actions during this part of the book given his age. He’s still a teenager at this point and we all know how important public image and fitting in is for people in that age group. However, even as the story progresses I never felt like Connell got to a point where he is genuinely proud of having Marianne by his side and that, in my opinion, was the biggest obstacle on his part. That said, let’s get on with this review because I still have so much to say. 🔹  The romance: 〰 Not once did I feel like the main characters were meant to be together. Connell was, to put it simply, not what Marianne needed given her own (psychological) issues. Connell’s deep social anxiety and fear of public rejection fed into Marianne’s self loathing and low self esteem. He constantly used Marianne’s feelings for him to his advantage and the poor girl loved him so much that she let him hurt her over and over again. 〰 In my opinion, the relationship between our Mc’s was an extremely toxic one… on all fronts. Marianne helped Connell with his depression and his own issues but to be honest, I never felt like he did the same for her. If anything, even I could feel how lonely she was. Another thing that bothered me is the fact that Marianne never, ever meets anyone who’s genuinely nice (or even normal to be honest— which I thought was quite unrealistic because not everyone out there is an asshole). Every single relationship that she ends up being in is toxic and I think that the author decided to do that to urge her readers to see that in comparison, Connell is actually a god-sent and we should ship his relationship with Marianne. That was not the case me for though. Connor’s inner dialogue and his awareness of just how much power he has over her was kind of horrifying at times to be honest (as you can see by the quotes that I have left here).  “She would have lain on the ground and let him walk over her body if he wanted, he knew that.”“He pitied her in the end, but she also repulsed him.”“He has a terrible sense all of a sudden that he could hit her face, very hard even, and she would just sit there and let him.” “Marianne is someone he can ask things of.”“Part of the feeling was knowing the terrible hold he’d had over her, and still had, and could not foresee ever losing.”“But he always thought she was damaged, he thought it anyway. He screws his eyes shut with guilt.”“She was in his power, he had chosen to redeem her, she was redeemed.” And finally, my personal favorite: “Ever since school he has understood his power over her. […] His effortless tyranny over someone who seems, to other people, so invulnerable. He has never been able to reconcile himself to the idea of losing this hold over her, like a key to an empty property, left unavailable for future use. In fact he has cultivated it, and he knows he has.” 〰 Moreover, let’s not forget Marianne’s constant need to apologize to Connell and to make sure that she hasn’t done anything to upset him. If that’s not an abusive relationship then I don’t know what is. At this point, I know that a lot of you might say that I’m being too harsh and that he has never physically hurt her or even been explicitly verbally abusive with her. To that I say that it doesn’t matter. Connell constantly draws from her without giving anything back. I even felt like he was sucking the life out of her at times to be honest. He takes advantage of her feelings for him every single time he’s down but the second he feels better, he leaves and finds someone who’s not “damaged” like her, knowing damn well what his rejection will do to her.  “I wouldn’t have enjoyed it either, she says. I would have done it if you wanted, but I could see you didn’t.”“If I’ve done something to upset you, I’m really sorry.” 🔹 Self growth and psychological state: 〰 Connell manages to find the professional help that he needs once his depression and anxiety hit an all time high which was great. He’s able to work on himself and find the help that he needs which in turn, helps him grow as a person. What I hated however, is that Marianne never does that. Marianne, who has so many deeply rooted issues and disorders never gets any sort of professional help. She draws her energy from Connell and her self worth depends on what the latter thinks of her. 〰 Another thing that I really really wanted to see in this book is Marianne have a mental breakdown. I know that this sounds awful and it’s such an awful thing to say but I think it would have made a lottt of sense given Marianne’s mental state towards the end. Thing is, every single time Connor did something that bothered her or completely destroyed her, she never really told him. She bottled it all up and forgave him before even being offered an apology. She did the same thing with everyone else which is why I think that a mental breakdown where she finally got everything off her chest (starting with the stupid Debs, continuing with the way Connor treated her both in high school and college, and finishing with everything she went through with her other abusive relationships —the friendship as well as the romantic ones) would have made a lot of sense. I wanted her to scream them all at Connor because I seriously never felt like he understood just how deeply he hurt her, whether he meant to or not. After that, I wanted her to finally start getting the professional help that she needed. After getting everything off her chest, helping Connor understand that there’s no way she actually truly forgave him for everything he’s done, that’s when I feel like she could’ve finally started a clean slate and began the process of healing. Alas, none of that happened which is probably the thing that disappointed me the most in this book. 〰 That said, my biggest problem with the relationship between these two is that while Connell grows and flourishes on his own for the most part in the book, Marianne’s self growth depends entirely on him (which I did not like).  “She has never believed herself fit to be loved by any person.”“He has never tried to delude her into thinking she was socially acceptable; she’d deluded herself.”🔹 The ending: 〰While I understand that many people adored the open ending in this book, I felt that it was the worst sort of conclusion for such a story. It cemented my belief that Marianne and Connor’s relationship was definitely not a strong one. Marianne once again finds herself in a position where she thinks that everything that has to do with his life and with his personal growth is more important than her. And so, she tells him to go to New York while she stays in Dublin knowing damn well that if he leaves, ”what they have now they can never have again” and that she will be crushed. That said, she still chooses his own happiness over hers. And, to be honest, when it comes to books that deal with mental health, I always feel like a closed and definite ending is the best way to go but that might just be me I guess. 🔹  Final thoughts: 〰 To recapitulate everything I’ve said in this review, although I really really enjoyed this, my two biggest problems with this book were the following:1. Connor’s love for Marianne did not feel genuine at any point in the story. I think he used her when he wanted to and was only able to be seen with her when he thought she became “socially acceptable”. That said, his own needs always came before her own.2. The fact that we never saw Marianne seek professional help. Her codependent behavior as well as the fact that the way she viewed herself depended entirely on the way he viewed her was saddening and unfortunately, it’s an aspect that needed to be changed to show her character’s growth but that never did.  “I don’t feel lovable. I think I have an unlovable sort of… I have a coldness about me, I’m difficult to like.” Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rose_books2/"
201,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9314299-jessica-odd-and-bookish,Rating 4 out of 5,"I received this book for free from the publisher (Hogarth Books).I give this book 3.5 stars which rounds up to 4.I was so excited to read this book because Sally Rooney’s other book, Conversations with Friends, is one of my all time favorite books. Because of that, I had high expectations for this book. Unfortunately, this book didn’t quite live up to them. There were a lot of things that I did like about this book. One being that I loved the writing style. It’s very beautiful in an understated way. I also have no issues whatsoever with the no quotation mark format that Rooney utilizes. I think it fits in well with her style.I also loved how the story delves deep into the characters and the psychology of Marianne and Connell’s relationship. It felt very intimate. Additionally, there were some passages that I really loved. On pages 71-72, I loved the paragraph describing Connell’s love of literature. Then on page 100-101, I loved the paragraph about Marianne and Connell’s discussions after sex. These two paragraphs are just some of the many examples of the beauty of her writing. On the flip side, what I didn’t like was that the story wasn’t that interesting. In Conversations with Friends, I loved the premise and things actually happened. In this book, there was just a lot of going back and forth between the characters. They would get together, then they would split, then they would get back together. It just didn’t interest me as much. I also wasn’t satisfied by the ending. It fell flat for me. Overall, this book didn’t live up to my expectations, but don’t let that stop you from reading it for yourself."

203,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27456036-barbara,Rating 3 out of 5,"3-4 starsI give this book 4 stars for the quality of Rooney's writing, but I didn't love it. Maybe if I was a millennial my appreciation would be more laudatory. I loved Catcher in the Rye which this book has been compared to, but I was around Holden's age when I read it. Chalk it up to age or whatever, but the constant wrangling of the meaning of what he/she said got tiring.The relationship between Connell and Marianne was sad but interesting. It certainly reflects how we all are a sum or our relationships and experiences - how past demons haunt us every day. However, some of C and M's conversations were repetitious and I just wanted to shake them and tell them what they weren't getting. Someone, please, tell M she needs therapy! Oh, if only they had my wisdom and experience!Although the ending was uplifting, I didn't feel it was in keeping with the rest of the book. I will continue to read Rooney, but I do feel her writing may still be evolving. Will this book be remembered as a classic as I have read some critics suggest? Maybe, but it doesn't have my vote."

The plot was boring, I did not like ANY of the characters, and the book was too long even though its only like 270 pages. Marianne saying at one point in the book ""If I can't have s*x with Connell, then I'd watch him have s*x with someone else"" for me was just creepy and made me very uncomfortable. The only reason I continued on from that point is because this book is one of the books I have to read for a challenge I am going to be doing on my bookstagram (@helenareadsxx if you haven't followed me already). But seriously, I never ever give books one star or come on here to say any book is bad (apart from The Silent Patient which has offensive content and is not worthy of any hype whatsoever because of that). I hate to leave negative reviews and I tried my best to find something positive to say in this review but honestly I can not find one thing. I am not reading another book by Sally Rooney that's for sure."

206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle,Rating 4 out of 5,"I had not expected this novel to make me feel... feels… so much. Despite its subject matter, this novel is neither twee nor sentimental; it’s a raw exploration of how we learn about and experience intimacy with someone. Rooney gets us under her characters’ skin in a most remarkable way. I had a hard time looking away from it, maybe because Marianne and Connell’s flaws and awkwardness were so painfully real. To be clear, while this is the story of two people who love each other, it is not what I’d describe as a love story: the blurb on the back of the book (“exquisite love story”) is a lie!Marianne and Connell go to school together in a small Western Irish town, but they might as well be from different worlds: Marianne is from a well-off family, but she is unpopular in school, bookish and mostly indifferent to what her schoolmates do or care about. Connell is from a poorer family, but he is very popular and well-adjusted. His mother works as a cleaner, and Marianne's mother is one of her clients, so Connell sometimes sees Marianne outside of school and they eventually strike up a conversation. The truth is that neither of them is the people their classmates think they are, and they let their guards down around each other and begin a sexual relationship. Both of them are vulnerable in very different ways, and neither of them really knows how to deal with that, so things go predictably wrong, despite their very genuine affection and attachment to each other. When they bump into each other again at Trinity College in Dublin, the tables have turned: Marianne is well-liked, comfortable in the college's social life, and Connell is looked down on for being working-class and has a hard time making friends. They reconnect and as they work on their degree, the game of push and pull started in high school begins again...This is the first millennial coming of age story I read, and while I am a bit older than Marianne and Connell, a lot of their experiences felt very familiar, either because I went through similar things or because friends of mine struggled the same way they do. I’ll admit that Rooney hit a nerve with me: Marianne’s experience of high school is uncomfortably close to mine. She also perfectly captures the frustration of trying to explain to people who were raised in a loving home that your own family can be your worse enemy, and of the nasty effect gaslighting can have on the way a person perceives themselves, and subsequently reacts to the way people treat them.Rooney is very critical of toxic social dynamics, of how important other people’s opinions and perceptions of us are, and how they can insidiously take control of our lives and ruin good things. Marianne and Connell self-sabotage a lot, but it’s only tragically believable that someone would sacrifice their happiness on the altar of peer pressure and social acceptance. I kept wanting them to communicate better, to be more honest with themselves and each other. But I know this is not how people that age work…This is a strange little book, with no real plot, but a lot of complicated emotions. I’m honestly not sure whom to recommend this to: the writing is both detached and uncomfortably intimate, jumping back and forth enough times to give you whiplash, the events it describes are insane and yet all too realistic... I’m not sure I enjoyed it, per se, but it captivated me for two whole days and made me feel like I had a crushed beer can in my belly. If you are willing to put up with the discomfort, check it out!"
207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14174872-lea,Rating 1 out of 5,"It is an annoying fact that we often have more to say about books we end up hating than the ones we loved and would like to recommend. I don't like to spoil the books I liked, for instance. Preserve the mystery for future readers and all that. But I think I could probably spend all day complaining about this book. I'll try to keep it brief.I would frankly like to slap every single person who insists on comparing Sally Rooney to Jane Austen. Kindly get Austen's name out of your damn mouths, you freaks.I would also like to know what the people who call this book ""a romance"", ""an elegant love story"" are smoking. Is it crack? because what. the fuck.This is one of the most overrated books I've ever read. It's painfully pretentious, gimmicky and try-hard.The book has no plot. It is basically a series of snapshots of the world's most boring relationship between two of the most boring, navel-gazing and pretentious people to never exist. All these people care about is sounding highly intellectual (this involves paying lip service to communism while living on your family's money and never working a day in your life, and talking about Palestine in college parties) and being popular (even as adults. Seriously). They have an on-off relationship because they're full of boring hang-ups, and they keep cheating on their current partners during the ""off"" months. That's basically it, that's the book. It goes nowhere and nobody grows up. There are no side plots to speak of, nor secondary characters with more depth than a puddle.I have to say that in the beginning, this novel reminded me a bit of Celeste Ng's Little Fires Everywhere (which came out first). In both novels, a woman, who had a baby while very young and is very nice and sympathetic, is the cleaner for an unlikeable rich family. The cleaner's kid and one of the rich kids begin a secret relationship. Celeste Ng took this premise and basically wrote a soap opera as a novel; it makes for a fun if shallow read. Rooney took this premise and said: ""how can I make it a PONDEROUS LITERARY NOVEL?"". So she removed all quotation marks and made it depressing and weird, and sprinkled as many ""cynical millenial"" things as she could, without much care for developing them: bullying! communism! BSDM! the financial crisis! English lit students! MFAs! abuse! depression! suicide! hermetic college cliques! sexting! being broke! anxiety! pedo teachers! Kanye West! and the result is both gross and insubstantial. Thanks but no thanks."
208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128938274-sophie,Rating 5 out of 5," Normal People  follows the on-again/off-again relationship and friendship of Marianne and Connell. Both are from different worlds, Connell, whose mom is Marianne's housekeeper, and Marianne, who is the daughter of rich but emotionally distant socialites. In high school, Connell is a popular star soccer player, and Marianne is essentially a social pariah. But in college, their roles reverse, Marianne, fits in easily among the haughty high-class university students, and Connell is a bit of an outsider, being from a working-class background. I didn't initially like this until about 40 or 50 pages in, I was really off-put by Connell's behavior towards Marianne in the beginning. I mean- I know they had an arrangement and that he has social anxiety and everything, but it still, seems kind of crappy to  f7ck someone and then not talk to them or look at them in school- and then ask  another girl  to go to the dance with them  That part was- bad. BUT he seemed to redeem himself sort of over the course of the book, so I forgive him. I'm having trouble coming up with other things to say about this book, but I really enjoyed it. I thought all of the depiction of struggles surrounding mental health and abuse were very powerful and well done. It was cathartic when  Marianne eventually escaped her abusive situation and Connell *I think* tackled a lot of his depression and anxiety.  In terms of the ending though-I NEED CLOSURE!!!! How can you just leave it like that? DE PRESS ING. UN RE SOLVED. Ugh. Extremely dissatisfying. Anyways, Overall though, very good, new favorite. (:Happy reading <3"
209,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,Rating 2 out of 5,"Normal People studies the relationship dynamics of two young people. It starts in high school. Connell is one of the popular boys. Marianne is an outsider, with no friends. His mother is her parents’ maid and they meet at her house. As their relationship deepens, he insists on keeping it separate from school and she is okay with that. Next time they meet, it’s college. And now, she’s the popular one. And so it goes. For all their talk, they don’t communicate clearly about the important things, which leads to misinterpretation and breakups. This is a slow, drawn out examination of their on again, off again relationship. It hits on their different social and economic positions. It hits on mental health issues (be aware, it touches on masochism). What it never explains are Marianne’s family dynamics, which are seriously screwed up. I don’t think I was the intended audience. This is another of those books that are wildly popular and I’m wondering what I missed. I just didn’t care about either of these characters, let alone their friends who were really annoying. I listened to this and Aoife McMahon as the narrator did a good job. "

I’m a big fan of slice-of-life novels that meander and showcase the utter messiness of life because it carries an authenticity that other novels may not hold. We follow two people who feel as though they are lost at sea and find solace in one another, even if their shared dependency hinders them at the end of the day, and from page one, I was hooked. I really enjoyed how each chapter caused a time jump to showcase not only the distance that separates Marianne and Connell but how quickly life moves in your 20s. I think Sally perfectly captures that First Love feeling where you’d cut out your heart if it made the other person smile and how that attachment can linger inside you for years. While these characters frustrated me and stressed me out with their careless decisions and a deep lack of love for themselves, I was moved by the effortless portrayal of being lost in your twenties and the endless changes that accompany you during that time in your life. No one in their twenties is put together or knows where they’re headed next, and Sally Rooney reminds us of the mess of it all."

Rooney is the kind of writer who is not only exceptionally skilled at writing, but she’s also the kind of writer who really gets people. This novel, perfectly captures what it is to be young, anxious, confused, and imperfect. It’s much more than an exploration of relationships and their dynamics, its discussion of youthful decision-making, in all its unthinking, arbitrary glory, and the power this has to change the course of lives is astute. In short, I think Rooney is very, very clever, and this book is too."

215,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18989854-krystal,Rating 3 out of 5,"Eugh.That awkward moment when an author forgets a book needs punctuation and an ENDING.I miss the days when books could just be good stories. Like, why does everything now have to test the boundaries of literature by messing with punctuation, style, format, etc in order to be considered decent? Or clever?Here we have a story about two completely messed up slightly abnormal individuals and how they impact the lives of one another over the course of four years. The storytelling is fine, the story is actually kind of messed up unique, and the characters have a lot of depth.So why the need to exclude speech marks? Why the need to slice and dice everything so dramatically? Why the need to be so fkn ambiguous? I found this book really hard to put down, because I enjoyed the constantly evolving dynamics. I mean it definitely got a bit repetitive, and there's a fair bit of heavy drama, but it was like watching a ten-car pile-up. Each moment had its own unique impact, and I couldn't tear myself away from it, even if sometimes it was completely horrific.But it's also just too focused on style for me. Clearly Sally Rooney's speech marks are hanging out with SJM's question marks in the land of abandoned punctuation.I honestly don't know how to feel about it. I liked how very real the characters felt, and I liked that it wasn't just a sappy love story. I liked that mistakes were made and other people were involved and that our two main characters were basically broken, pathetic little things that reminded me of how broken and pathetic we all are at times. I liked the wittiness of the title, because here we have two normal people who are so messed up that they are as normal as everyone else. That whole, 'there's no such thing as normal' idea 100% appeals to me.I appreciate that it gave a little insight into the world of people who experience anxiety and depression, but it felt like the exploration of these themes was a little light on. Which I guess is intentional; kind of alluding again to that title - anxiety and depression are pretty common experiences and thus could be considered normal. Overall, it was a fascinating story but jeez, what was that ending? I mean, I was expecting to hate the end, just because I could see the author was trying to be clever with her writing, and for some reason 'clever' and 'happy ending' never seem to go together. But I was not expecting what I got.So I guess avoid it if you hate books with no speech marks, although you do kinda get used to it with this one because 'x said' is usually tacked on there somewhere. Also avoid if you like everything wrapped up nice and neat.Pick this one up if you're curious about the more depraved side of relationships, if you're interested in character explorations, if you're into literary fiction that tries really hard to be clever.Give it a chance if you're on the fence - you're looking at a fairly easy read of less than 300 pages so it's worth attempting it.This was book 18 of my #dymocks52challenge refined.

“Their feelings were suppressed so carefully in everyday life, forced into smaller and smaller spaces, until seemingly minor events took on insane and frightening significance.”
What can I say about Normal People?
S P E C T A C U L A R
A true and somewhat thorough study of two vulnerable and mentally damaged adolescents: one gripped by near crippling social anxiety while the other was severely scarred by an abusive family.And surprisingly but gratefully this was such an angsty book.Incidentally, I went to my first ever therapy session while I was reading this and I don’t think that it (the therapy) helped me learned about myself as much as I did simply by finishing the book. So read into that as you will. All in all, I experienced “the pleasure of being touched by great art”. As so aptly put by the professor in the story.On a personal note: since the beginning I got a strong sense of nostalgia, same feeling I had reading You Against Me and oh how much I have missed that book, and how much I have longed for anything even remotely close to it!PS. If anyone has any UK and Ireland-based authors/books recommendations, especially YA but General Lit too, I will forever be in your debt."

I honestly don't really know how to explain my opinions about this book, I did not like this book, I just did not feel good while reading it. The whole time I was reading it I was just left with a yucky feeling. I have a really big problem with how it seems to romanticize this submissive, abusive and self absorbed behaviour. For me personally, that just does not work. The writing seemed a bit pretentious to me too. Like it was trying too hard to sound literary. And the way it talked about uneducated people; there were many comments that were made by the main characters that I think were supposed to be the non judgmental ones, that where judgmental af. I will admit there were some parts where the insights into peoples emotions and behaviours seemed very real and insightful but these moments didn't really make up for the rest of the book for me. I know this book as gotten such great acclaim and has been nominated or won many awards but unfortunately, this book was just not for me.I received an ARC of this through Netgalley."

Siempre me organizo para comentar en las metas marcadas, pero con esta novela he llegado tarde en las dos. Me costaba ponerme con ella... Me ha gustado mucho en la forma, pero quizá no tanto en el fondo.La forma es diferente y eso para mí siempre es un plus. No tener rayas de diálogo lo hace no-normal y ese tono frío como si la autora hubiera pasado la narración por un criogenizador ❄ creo que le da realismo y le va muy bien a la historia.El fondo dando vueltas a los encuentros y desencuentros entre Marianne y Connell me ha recordado a esas manos locas con las que jugábamos de niños. Nuestros protagonistas se alejan y estiran la goma elástica, pero luego vuelven a juntarse 🧲. Y lo hacen una y otra vez. Y leyendo pensaba que de tanto estirar la cuerda igual era mejor que se rompiese 💥 para que ambos pudieran pasar página...No sé si la novela me ha gustado mucho o poco, pero sé que me ha gustado leerla porque es una lectura que deja cierto poso, ahí grabado como en segundo plano 🧠.Desde luego, Gente normal no es un Libro normal."

Don't get me wrong, I really love a character driven novel, but this one just didn't seem to hold my attention. It felt a little reminiscent of One Day in December, only that book was better because it had a 'will they/won't they' feel to it. This had more of a 'why are these two people together in the first place' feel to it. Neither character was good at communicating, and the constant circling of each other just felt drawn out. Oh and the weird BDSM thing thrown in there was strange. Also, was I the only one who thought Marianne was blocking out something more sinister with her family? "

There literally was no plot, no beginning and no ending, I couldn’t care less about either of the main characters, and there just was no story going on, just a repetitive cycle of hello-sex-bye between a girl and a boy who seem to love each other but don’t wanna admit it.

225,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11296522-fatma,Rating 5 out of 5,"Normal People is a novel that moved me. It's a book that could've so easily veered into the grandiose, but instead maintained a quiet kind of significance, an insistence of the momentous in the everyday. Its story hinges on two central characters—Connell and Marianne—their thoughts, their flaws, their conversations, their relationship(s). On the surface, the story's plot isn't much: two people living their lives, coming together and drifting apart. But what draws you into this story is not the structural but the personal. Rooney's characters are so tenderly drawn, so well-realized. Their conversations feel authentic, filled with pockets of humour and hints of vulnerability and the undercurrent of things unsaid. More than anything, though, the novel's moments ring true. They are not disembodied Deep Literary Moments, but individual, particular, personal moments—not about meaning as a distant concept, but about meaning as a lived experience. Like I said, this book moved me. I finished it crying but not knowing why, only feeling that I'd read something that struck me as remarkably honest.

It is a commonly used tools but when overused, a person like me who likes to live her life in the absolute crystal clear, is despised (at least by me). I have always disliked situations where people mean something but act the otherwise and against their best judgement. And Oh Boy! this book used it for way too many times. Connell was okay and the parts about him were actually relatable; the financial, mental and emotional times that he went through were so well written and I don't fault anything about him. Him going to therapy were some of my favourite parts even though he was having such a difficult time. Him losing his words in class because he felt too intimidated by the superficial and fake-ness of his classmates was too personal for me. Yes, he was a bit of a D to Marianne in the beginning but he did realise and eventually apologise about it. We love some character developments. Coming to Marianne, I have never disliked someone so much as I have disliked her. I am not kidding. If Connell went to therapy, she should have been the first one to stand in the line for it. This girl needs to resolve so many of her issues and she keeps internalising them and drawing them out for far to f long. She actually pulls people in sad loop and she cannot make up her mind. She keeps assuming too much. She needs to have some alone time and get it straight. Reading her thoughts was like listening to a broken record of melancholic songs. She's a mess. I need a break. Just stop. Talking about the writing, Rooney doesn't use quotation marks which is okay by me since i have seen it a lot online and as a writing instrument- it blurs the line between what is being said and what is meant to be said. It happens often in life, but I was so frustated I think I lost a few hair after I finished this. Her writing isn't complex and it read like a grungy millenial heading towards a burn out- again too personal to me. She used intimacy between the characters as a plot device which is a good idea but I dislike intimacy being used like that. I am more of a ""talk-it-out-and-let's-have-a-good-time"" person. But drawing out the issues and miscommunications for too f long took all my ""like-ness"" and it went downhill for me. I liked the soft, open ending and I like to believe that inspite of all they went through, Connell will still hold a candle for her and they will be old together in their own strange way. Beyond my reasonability, but yes.The more I think about it, the more I feel like bumping up the book's rating but it's about ""Connell and Marianne"". If it was about Connell I'd have given at least ""2.5 or 3"". Giving this a 2 because I do GET IT. I hate that I do. Yes, I reread some of the book and had to force myself to straighten my thoughts to come up with a better review than ""I disliked this."" -------------08/2020:If your favorite word is ""OK"" and you like to spend your time staring at a wall, then I'm sure you'd enjoy this book.I have watched the show too and it's only good for aesthetics."

Even worse, they talk about the most toxic, most unspeakable aspects of my past and present personality. While Frances from Conversations with Friends embodied every single bad coping strategy I adopted in my early twenties, Marianne — a more self-aware and down-to-earth character — reminded me so much of my younger self that I had to take breaks from reading in order to avoid getting too emotionally involved in her painfully relatable struggles.I guess what I could say to help prospective readers decide whether they should pick up this book is: don't expect the main characters to be emotionally competent, or headed towards a classic happy ending. This is a story about life, and life has no happy ending. It's also a story about love, and the protagonists certainly love each other, but I wouldn't call their relationship a classic romance: rather, the narrative focuses on the characters' psychological and emotional growth, something I felt was sorely lacking in the author's debut novel and took a prominent role here. Rooney's strength as a writer lies entirely in her psychological realism, in her ability to infuse seemingly irrelevant gestures with deep meaning to the point where they reveal intimate truths about the people who make them. The vital importance of subtext is emphasized by the fact that Rooney's protagonists use emotional distance and aloofness as a coping mechanism and would therefore quite literally rather die than express their feelings, especially negative ones, out loud to the people they believe might hurt them. To those who aren't familiar with this kind of convoluted reasoning, their behaviour may seem nonsensical and irritating; in fact, I believe most readers who disliked this book were mainly put off by this one aspect of the characters' personalities. Those of us who have experienced Marianne and Connell's internal struggles, on the other hand, will likely understand the undercurrent of crushing passion and pain that runs throughout their story. We might even end up being carried away by it."

A dirla tutta mi sono sentito totalmente disconnesso da tutto il libro.Persone normali è zeppo di complicazioni e drammi emotivi da YA. Vacuo, un po’ insulso, non aggiunge molto all’ideale narrativo/cinematografico di storia d’amore tra alti e bassi con personaggi 18-24.Fin troppo manicheo nell’infilare personaggi che, al di fuori di Connell e Marianne, risultano dimenticabili, irrispettosi e poco interessanti. Ci sono cose poi che non ho capito: le crudeltà di Alan dovrebbero aiutare a capire il carattere di Marianne, ma sembrano solo casuali e inspiegabili, al limite del ridicolo. La madre la odia e non si capisce perché. Marianne sembra a volte bruttina e a volte attraente. A volte estremamente sola e altre popolare. La sua è una combo casalinga inesplorata, un buco nero. Le sfocature cronologiche all’interno dei capitoli (1. tempo attuale 2. riferimento al passato 3. tempo attuale) sono una delle poche cose interessanti, solo che alla lunga rendono lo stile ripetitivo e prevedibile. A me è sembrato bisognoso di un editing disperato e incisivo, così pieno com’è di frasi e descrizioni inconcludenti, non richieste, che non portano da nessuna parte. Certo, Sally Rooney è molto giovane, ma ha già dimostrato di saper fare cose notevoli.Parlarne tra amici era stato un esordio fragoroso.

230,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53067896-amina,Rating 5 out of 5,"I devoured this intense, deeply moving story in one day. The conversations flowed smoothly; quickly without erroneous fluff. Marianne, an awkward unknown girl at school, while Connell, (love that name) is one of the popular, sporty kids. No one knows that Connell’s mother is the maid at Marianne’s house. They embark on a sordid, secretive affair, or so that is what Connell assumes.
Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn't know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it
This story could have been typically cliche: they fall for each other and have to keep things hush-hush. However, Rooney took an age-old played-out theme and reinvents it, with relatable, smart, more than one-dimensional characters. 
Most people go through their whole lives, without ever really feeling that close with anyone
Marianne and Connell are extremely bright characters, their thoughts, mostly confined to themselves. The book sometimes felt frustrating, if only they would tell each other how they really felt, you think. 
I don't know what's wrong with me, says Marianne. I don't know why I can't be like normal people
They both recognize the flaws in themselves and in each other, but the cyclical dance keeps them from sharing, opening their true selves. I’ve read this book twice--and love her writing style! Also, the show on Hulu was such a great companion to the book. The author helped in the process of production, which made the show follow closely with the book! The writing is crisp, smart, and thoughtful. I enjoyed every minute of it. This is my second Rooney book--I must say, I'm a fan.  5+ stars"
231,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6361389-lee,Rating 5 out of 5,"Now somehow NOT shortlisted for the 2018 Booker Prize...Sally Rooney sold her first two books to Faber at the age of 25, and Normal People suggests the decision was a no-brainer. I can think only of Rachel Cusk (who Rooney resembles in imparting so much with such elegant concision) and Karl Ove Knausgaard as possessing Rooney’s ability to write such deceptively slight-seeming (but in fact – hyperbole alert – often Chekhovian) yet mesmerising and addictive literary fiction.There’s little immediately obvious in Normal People (or Conversations with Friends) that might point to Rooney being in possession of a rare talent. At first glance, you might be forgiven for wondering what all the fuss was about. But very quickly the style – spritely and shorn of all literary fat; dialogue-heavy – Rooney employs gathers traction and force until you find yourself irked at having to put the thing down.“Marianne is grinning now. She exercises an open contempt for people in school. She has no friends and spends her lunchtimes alone reading novels. A lot of people really hate her. Her father died when she was thirteen and Connell has heard she has a mental illness now or something. It’s true she is the smartest person in school. He dreads being left alone with her like this, but he also finds himself fantasising about things he could say to impress her.You’re not top of the class in English, he points out.She licks her teeth, unconcerned.Maybe you should give me grinds, Connell, she says.He feels his ears get hot. She’s probably just being glib and not suggestive, but if she is being suggestive it’s only to degrade him by association, since she is considered an object of disgust. She wears ugly thick-soled flat shoes and doesn’t put make-up on her face. People have said she doesn’t shave her legs or anything. Connell once heard that she spilled chocolate ice cream on herself in the school lunchroom, and she went to the girls’ bathrooms and took her blouse off to wash it in the sink. That’s a popular story about her, everyone has heard it. If she wanted, she could make a big show of saying hello to Connell in school. See you this afternoon, she could say, in front of everyone. Undoubtedly it would put him in an awkward position, which is the kind of thing she usually seems to enjoy. But she has never done it.What were you talking to Miss Neary about today? says Marianne. Oh. Nothing. I don’t know. Exams.Marianne twists the spoon around inside the jar.Does she fancy you or something? Marianne says.Connell watches her moving the spoon. His ears still feel very hot. Why do you say that? he says.God, you’re not having an affair with her, are you?Obviously not. Do you think it’s funny joking about that?Sorry, says Marianne. She has a focused expression, like she’s looking through his eyes into the back of his head.You’re right, it’s not funny, she says. I’m sorry.He nods, looks around the room for a bit, digs the toe of his shoe into a groove between the tiles.Sometimes I feel like she does act kind of weird around me, he says. But I wouldn’t say that to people or anything.”Marianne is obviously unusual, a terminal outsider from a rich but odd family, a plain- looking and unconventional girl. She sees Connell when he turns up to meet his mum, who cleans at Marianne’s house; Connell is clearly a popular and at least superficially conventional student from the opposite end of the socio-economic scale. Both are amongst the smartest in their school, but both run in vastly different social circles. Marianne has no interest or need in currying favour with anyone; she’s both seemingly uninterested in other people and protected from the requirement of networking by wealth. Connell is doing his best to fit in and needs other people to thrive; he also needs validation.The two are drawn together out of their mutual incongruence around groups, that the whole charade of school and jostling crudely for attention is something the other also despises. They’re unclubbable allies whose only moments of clarity and respite are while mutually resolving their outlier statuses, and despite her awkward uncertainties and his appreciation of his own shallowness, and that Marianne is not the girl he is supposed to be pursuing, her cachet unaligned with his own (which only adds to his interest), the inevitable ensues.“You know you were saying the other day that you like me, he said. In the kitchen you said it, when we were talking about school.Yeah.Did you mean like as a friend, or what?She stared down into her lap. She was wearing a corduroy skirt and in the light from the window she could see it was flecked with pieces of lint.No, not just as a friend, she said.Oh, okay. I was wondering.He sat there, nodding to himself.I’m kind of confused about what I feel, he added. I think it would be awkward in school if anything happened with us.No one would have to know.He looked up at her, directly, with total attention. She knew he was going to kiss her, and he did. His lips were soft. His tongue moved into her mouth slightly. Then it was over and he was drawing away. He seemed to remember he was holding the book, and began to look at it again.That was nice, she said.He nodded, swallowed, glanced down at the book once more. His attitude was so sheepish, as if it had been rude of her even to make reference to the kiss, that Marianne started to laugh. He looked flustered then.Alright, he said. What are you laughing for?Nothing.You’re acting like you’ve never kissed anyone before.Well, I haven’t, she said.He put his hand over his face. She laughed again, she couldn’t stop herself, and then he was laughing too. His ears were very red and he was shaking his head. After a few seconds he stood up, holding the book in his hand.Don’t go telling people in school about this, okay? he said.Like I would talk to anyone in school.He left the room. Weakly she crumpled off the seat, down onto the floor, with her legs stretched out in front of her like a rag doll. While she sat there she felt as if Connell had been visiting her house only to test her, and she had passed the test, and the kiss was a communication that said: You passed. She thought of the way he’d laughed when she said she’d never kissed anyone before. For another person to laugh that way might have been cruel, but it wasn’t like that with him.”Marianne is casually groped in front of peers largely indifferent to her shock and distress; Rachel, a blatant and amusingly awful rival for Connell’s affections delights in such a disaster; Connell comforts Marianne and eventually takes her home. This is the first occasion he’s shown his feelings for her amongst the group (they usually ignore each other to save his embarrassment). Eventually they end up in bed together, but it’s still illicit and slightly shameful to Connell, to the extent that he can’t even confide in his mother about any of it.“So is Marianne your girlfriend, then? said Lorraine.No.What does that mean? You’re having sex with her but she’s not your girlfriend? You’re prying into my life now, he said. I don’t like that, it’s not your business. He returned to the bag and removed a carton of eggs, which he placed on the countertop beside the sunflower oil.Is it because of her mother? said Lorraine. You think she’d frown on you?What?Because she might, you know.Frown on me? said Connell. That’s insane, what have I ever done?I think she might consider us a little bit beneath her station.He stared at his mother across the kitchen while she put a box of own-brand cornflakes into the press. The idea that Marianne’s family considered themselves superior to himself and Lorraine, too good to be associated with them, had never occurred to him before. He found, to his surprise, that the idea made him furious. What, she thinks we’re not good enough for them? he said.I don’t know. We might find out.She doesn’t mind you cleaning their house but she doesn’t want your son hanging around with her daughter? What an absolute joke. That’s like something from nineteenth-century times, I’m actually laughing at that.You don’t sound like you’re laughing, said Lorraine.”The reluctance to treat the relationship as anything but a secret is all wasted energy: far too late Connell realises that everyone knew anyway and nobody cared. But before that harrowing (all the more for it being so obvious, and confirmation of a ruinous narcissism) epiphany the two will break apart, find the pull of what each offers the other too much to be deprived of for too long, and then part ways once again leaving old, stitched-up wounds unpicked and agape, until the only means of reparation – another reunion – is once again sought. This return/abandonment scenario runs through the novel right to the close, and ultimately suggests two people incapable of being alone or within the confines of a relationship, but also makes plenty of indirect and persuasive comment on the inadequacy of conventional relationship parameters, to which these two candidates futilely attempt to adapt to.Connell inexplicably (but convincingly; this is one of Rooney’s chief attributes – everything she attempts works, purely down to brilliant characterisation) asks Rachel to go to the Debutante Ball, a gesture he knows will crush Marianne, and the novel then jumps ahead to their next confrontation. Marianne has a habit of letting Connell off the hook, and regularly leaves the door open by retaining an unflustered (or indifferent? – Connell is often unsure, and has to falteringly find his way back to who she is) mood.“Jesus Christ, she says. Connell Waldron! From beyond the grave.He coughs and, in a panic to appear normal, says: When did you take up smoking?To Gareth, to her friends, she adds: We went to school together. Fixing her gaze on Connell again, looking radiantly pleased, she says: Well, how are you? He shrugs and mumbles: Yeah, alright, good. She looks at him as if her eyes have a message in them. Would you like a drink? she says. He holds up the bottle Gareth gave him. I’ll get you a glass, she says. Come on inside. She goes up the steps to him. Over her shoulder she says: Back in a second. From this remark, and from the way she was standing on the steps, he can tell that all these people at the party are her friends, she has a lot of friends, and she’s happy. Then the front door shuts behind them and they’re in the hallway, alone.He follows her to the kitchen, which is empty and hygienically quiet. Matching teal surfaces and labelled appliances. The closed window reflects the lighted interior, blue and white. He doesn’t need a glass but she takes one from the cupboard and he doesn’t protest. Taking her jacket off, she asks him how he knows Gareth. Connell says they have classes together. She hangs her jacket on the back of a chair. She’s wearing a longish grey dress, in which her body looks narrow and delicate.Everyone seems to know him, she says.He’s extroverted.He’s one of these campus celebrities, says Connell.That makes her laugh, and it’s like everything is fine between them, like they live in a slightly different universe where nothing bad has happened but Marianne suddenly has a cool boyfriend and Connell is the lonely, unpopular one.He’d love that, says Marianne.He seems to be on a lot of like, committees for things.She smiles, she squints up at him. Her lipstick is very dark, a wine colour, and she’s wearing make-up on her eyes.I’ve missed you, she says.This directness, coming so soon and so unexpectedly, makes him blush. He starts pouring the beer into the glass to divert his attention.Yeah, you too, he says. I was kind of worried when you left school and all that. You know, I was pretty down about it.Well, we never hung out much during school hours.No. Yeah. Obviously.And what about you and Rachel? says Marianne. Are you still together?No, we broke up there during the summer.In a voice just false enough to sound nearly sincere, Marianne says: Oh. I’m sorry.”At no point are we led to understand that either Marianne or Connell will drift apart for long, or that any of their intervening relationships are likely to last. Much of the novel’s enjoyment is derived from seeing this genuinely likeable, if fraught, match-up reconvene; much of its power is hewn from the impossibility that any reunion can last.Marianne’s home life becomes a growing if disturbing matter of relevance. Her long-dead father, it’s revealed, used to beat her up; her brother, a hectoring, leering monster, has taken on this mantle and aggressively hounds her whenever she’s in the house, or whenever she returns once she’s left, the level of his rage, steeped in a parental model that exculpates and validates his vile habit, worsening until a particularly violent confrontation leaves Marianne with a broken nose. (This harrowing scene, an extreme but typical unravelling among such deeply dysfunctional siblings, is compounded by the matter of Marianne seeking openly violent relationships in which she is submissively beaten by a series of appalling predators, such as a Swede called Lukas who ties her up and takes photos of her in degrading poses; such acts make warped sense of her worthlessness and subjugation and yet offer brief, vacuous emancipation from it. She even asks Connell to perform such acts, but he refuses, which is yet another cue for their coming apart.) Connell is the only person she thinks of to ask for help, and for all the complexities surrounding their failure to resolve their attraction to each other, he instinctively drops everything to run to her aid. But it’s a disaster that you imagine is merely the precursor to one greater still.Normal People is a beguiling work that quickly and uncannily fleshes out several indelibly wrought characters, in particular the two central players, Marianne and Connell, whose misfortunes, mutual and exclusive (not that anything either does occurs out of the other’s shadow), and messy shucking-off of adolescent skins becomes a desperately compulsive drama. Marianne, we begin to feel, is not going to change, and Connell, after fluctuating dalliances with ‘normal’ life, spins back into her orbit, having tried to change, to leave her behind, to eschew the claustrophobia of being that close to someone, relents and allows who he really is some respite.You can’t achieve any of this – a slender storyline entirely reliant on the two central figures being compelling enough (I won’t say likeable; I found both extremely likeable but doubt all readers will, and surely far more important for a character to be intriguing than potential good company) – without fascinating characters, and characters are fascinating either through what they say and do or what they don’t say and do, and the meanings implicit in both acts and non-acts. The combination of outward and inward dialogue here – and the avoidance of exposition – creates two very complicated counterparts tormented by themselves, only at ease with each other, until the ease becomes something else, much misreading and misrepresentation is allowed to unfold, and a coming-apart augments self-loathing on both counts, which is then exacerbated by the fact that neither of these people are fully formed individuals. Much of their character is formed from what they see in each other, and how the other perceives them, a perception that is in itself subject to the usual mercurial changes and doubts.It’s interesting that as Connell begins to understand how he feels and who he might be, this acceleration in his self-perception occurs largely through writing. He composes long emails to Marianne and at one point, when meeting her along with other friends (which include the most enduring of her appalling partners, a ghastly Tory thug who revels in the imbalance of their relationship) bemoans being in her presence as it means he can’t write to her instead. He can’t think while around her, only react and want; when writing to her from a distance he understands what she means to him and in turn what he really wants – to keep her in his life. He can’t communicate with anyone else in remotely the same way, and wonders (unlike the reader) why...and in the meantime develops as a writer, spurred on by his muse.Rooney’s ear is often troublingly dead-on, and much of the novel’s success is drawn from the mortifying precision with which she assembles her protagonists’ woes via how their relationship falters, develops, comes apart. Neither can quite get a firm handle on the other, or themselves. But together they experience fleeting peace, a peace that can’t last. They recognise in each other the only place in which the world can be shut out, but soon forget that the world is, in fact, no real place for them, and yet it’s something that has to be contended with. While their bond isn’t illusory, it’s corroding, and untenable, and they will eventually both have to become whoever they’re going to become, at a disinterested world’s behest, without the person who knows and understands them best.“Do you think it would be better if we had never been together? she says.I don’t know. For me it’s hard to imagine my life that way. Like, I don’t know where I would have gone to college then or where I would be now.She pauses, lets this thought roll around for a moment, keeps her hand flat on her abdomen.It’s funny the decisions you make because you like someone, he says, and then your whole life is different. I think we’re at that weird age where life can change a lot from small decisions. But you’ve been a very good influence on me overall, like I definitely am a better person now, I think. Thanks to you.She lies there breathing. Her eyes are burning but she doesn’t make any move to touch them.When we were together in first year of college, she says, were you lonely then? No. Were you?No. I was frustrated sometimes but not lonely. I never feel lonely when I’m with you.Yeah, he says. That was kind of a perfect time in my life, to be honest. I don’t think I was ever really happy before then.”So it’s a horribly wrenching, moving tale, in which you’re simultaneously delighted to see the two protagonists back together whenever that happens (and want to know if such recouplings might also be on the cards beyond the novel’s agonising but astute ending), but then fearful of what’s going to go wrong and how badly, and the subsequent fallout. You can only create a story as simple yet enduring as this one if the nuances of behaviour, the potency of the spark, the import of every act is freighted with meaning and urgency and vitality and care. Sally Rooney cares about people, understands them and empathises with them. When you’re as good as she is, when even the briefest cameo is invested with the kind of deft, vivid élan that renders their authenticity beyond question, that goes a long way."

“So why, despite its factual accuracy, does this feel like a dishonest way of narrating what happened? What is the missing element, the excluded part of the story that explains what upset them both?”
I’ve been sitting on this review for three weeks now because no matter how much I tried, I just couldn’t find the words to convey everything this book made me feel. Normal People was the first book I read in a single day for the first time in years. It completely mesmerised me from the very first page, being captived by the main characters lives through the entire book. This is the story of Marianne Sheridan and Connell Waldron. At the beginning of the book, they are two teenagers going to the same high school in Carricklea, a small town in Ireland. Connell is the popular guy, whereas Marianne is the quiet and marginalized girl. They both come from different social classes: Connell is from a working class family and Marianne comes from a wealthy family. When the story begins, they only interact with each other at Marianne’s house since Connell’s mum, Lorraine, works as a cleaner for Marianne’s family and Connell goes to pick her up sometimes. But they soon begin a secret relationship.The plot sounds like a romance book, but Normal People is more than that. It’s a raw story about Marianne and Connell’s connection and how it impacts their individual journeys through the years. It’s also a story about power dynamics and mental health. Just make sure to be in the right headspace before diving into this book, since it focuses quite a lot on anxiety, domestic abuse, depression and suicidal thoughts. 
“No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.”
I know this is a very polarizing book and I can see why, but it personally worked for me. A lot of people is going to get frustrated because of the lack of communication and misunderstandings between Marianne and Connell. But I feel that Sally Rooney wrote their dynamic in such a painfully realistic way, that the communication problems between them is yet another portray of their respective personalities and their individual struggles with mental health. Also, I saw that some people hated the ending. I won’t go into detail because this is a spoiler-free review, but I loved it. I honestly can’t think of a more fitting and better ending and let’s just say that I have my own interpretation of it.I also want to mention that the author doesn’t use quotation marks denoting speech. I didn’t know that was part of Sally Rooney’s writing style before starting this book, so imagine my surprise when I opened it and started reading the first page. After a few paragraphs, I thought I wouldn’t be able to get into the story because of it. But then I just forgot about that and let myself to get immerse in Marianne’s and Connell’s lives. Also, there is something about the author’s writing that just makes every dialogue and monologue so captivating and compelling.Summing up, I don’t think my words can do justice to Normal People and everything it made me feel. I just can tell you that this book left me emotionally drained, that its characters have been in my mind for weeks, that I cried while reading it. This story feels too real, too intimate. I know this is not a book for everyone, but it just was a story for me and I can tell you, without a hint of doubt, that it has become one of my favourite books.

233,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12859342-skyler-autumn,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 StarsAnother one of those plotless novels (which I always love) Normal People follows the relationship between Connell and Marianne, two young people growing up in small town Ireland together, who both move to Dublin for university in 2011. Although this book is about two people interwoven in what I concluded (by the first few chapters) as a toxic relationship this book is at no point a romance or love story. It is simply an examination of the interpersonal relationships in our lives and how they effect us. I am a big fan of Sally Rooney's first novel A Conversation with Friends, perhaps because it focused a lot more on female friendships and mentors which I personally find more compelling and complex than romantic entanglements. So going into Normal People I was really excited to read the novel that got her Shortlisted on the Booker. I thought it must blow her first novel right out the water to be getting this level of praise but.... NOPE! I still prefer her debut, now, now, I'm not a crazy person I am fully aware the novel is exquisitely written and her ability to create social commentary with in subtle situation with out talking down to her readers should be goals for all writers, BUT this novel/the characters in this novel didn't draw me in like the first. Although flawed and highly self-absorbed like the characters in A Conversation with Friends, which is usually my cup of tea I love idiots that are self absorbed they are so fun to read. I actually found these characters constant self sabotaging too grating to truly enjoy and by the second half of the novel I kind wanted to slap both of them, especially Marianne who I felt never truly grew and just became more and more insecure and needy as the novel progressed. YES! I know that's realistic of most relationships but I still don't want to read about it on repeat, it just gets too infuriating like I wanted to yell get some self respect lady!!I also found will-they-won't-they repetitive and by the second half of the novel I found myself drifting off while reading (never a good sign). Also maybe it's cause I never been this ""in love"" or whatever these characters were feeling but it almost felt unrealistic? I don't know. I just have never come across such a complex relationship where two people feel such a constant pull towards each other, so by the last half of the book I was rolling my eyes a bit. All and all I enjoyed the first half, thought the writing was brilliant and will continue to follow this author cause she's a clearly a powerhouse and going far in life but if I had to recommend a book of Sally Rooney's to a friend it's still going to be A Conversation with Friends."

235,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11318464-alex-findingmontauk1,Rating 1 out of 5,"Deeply unsatisfying. I'm too angry and bored for words right now. But here we go. I waited and waited for this book to start being good and it never happened. The story was repetitive, mundane, and tried too hard to be pretentious (which is worse than actually being pretentious). They have sex. A few months go by. They get drunk and have sex again. Six weeks go by. They get drunk and have sex again. Five months go by. You see where I am going with this? The ENTIRE book is this. You have no sense of connection to the characters, you cannot understand their journey because of constant huge times jumps, and you simply can't care about either of them. If this book ended with one of them being in sexaholics anonymous then the setup of this book would have worked. BUT ALAS it did not end that way.Even the characters are inconsistent. In one part we have the main character saying, ""In a way I like the idea of something so dramatic happening to me. I would like to upset peoples expectations."" And then just pages later it is said, ""Marianne was so totally uninterested in what people thought of her, so extremely secure in her own self-perception."" What hot garbage. Make a choice and decide who your character is supposed to be - and if growth and change are supposed to be themes here, then allow us to explore that better by not changing the setting 4-6 months every 8 pages. There is literally no sense of connection with these one-dimensional, booze and sex obsessed twits who are only hooking up when the other is in a relationship it seems. BLAH BLAH BLAH.Garbage. Would never in a million years recommend this to my worst enemy. Rant over."

237,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59050228-meike,Rating 5 out of 5,"Longlisted for the Booker Prize 2018Rooney's sophomore novel once again focuses on post-millennial relationships, but at the same time, it's very different from her debut Conversations with Friends: The book revolves around the friendship/romantic involvement between Marianne, a rich kid who is perceived as an outsider at school, and Connell, a popular guy whose loving mother works as a cleaning woman in the mansion inhabited by Marianne's dysfunctional family. When Marianne and Connell enrol at Trinity College (Rooney's alma mater), their social status in their peer group changes: Now, Marianne is the popular kid. And that's more or less the whole story - once again, Rooney has written a page turner pretty much devoid of plot, a book that successfully focuses on the inner movements of and dynamics between its characters, and it works because Marianne and Coonnell, in all their shortcomings, are so complex and, yes, relatable. At least for me. Today, I listened to a radio piece by a well-known Austrian critic denouncing the book as pointless in an argument that can be summed up as ""OK boomer"". It's true that Rooney has been hailed as a typical voice of millennials - but is she, though? Isn't she more than that? I believe that her writing is more relatable to younger people as the stories present other young people living in the now, so in a very specific time (""Normal People"" starts in January 2011). But the themes she tackles are universal: We hear about classism, wealth gaps, gender roles, peer groups, habitus, status, and - this is the core of Marianne's and Connell's story - the attempt to build and maintain intimacy with another person, both emotionally and sexually. They disappoint and betray each other, they go their separate ways, they get back together, they try to be friends, etc. - relationship status: It's complicated. I have a hunch that other generations have struggled with these issues as well, just in different contexts, in their specific time.Rooney's writing is very held-back, it's witty in a quiet way. There are no flashy po-mo tricks, there is no elaborate scene setting, it's even-paced and dialogue-heavy. This typical style has a hypnotic quality, it creates suspense without giving any suspense on the plot level - I can't wrap my head around the fact that there are quite some people out there who claim that Rooney can't write because she does not use all the tricks available in the book of postmodernity, but chooses a sleek, controlled style instead (which btw is very apt considering her topics and main characters). So all in all, Sally Rooney is clearly my kind of writer, and I'm already excited to pick up her third effort. You can learn more about the book in our latest podcast episode (in German). "
238,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55478778-laura,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was about to stop reading this around the 100 page mark - because I was getting to the point where I couldn't stand any more young love - manoeuvres, but I am glad I eventually read all the way through to the last page.There are definitely points where this feels a little too close to that other blockbuster - 50 Shades of Grey, and I also started thinking about that teens series - the one where the girl falls in love with a guy - who is a wolf/vampire -sorry I was not paying attention.Rooney - on the other hand, does deserve to be congratulated because I think she tackles a fairly serious issue - or several in fact - with a sense that they were extremely real to her. There are some sections where the writing comes across as completely genuine - other parts - I did wonder where the whole story was going - at the page 103 mark.So - she deals with family abuse. Our main character Marianne, - her entire life is physically and mentally abused by her older brother Alan, and her mother Denise, who does nothing to stop this but in fact - permits Alan's atrocious behaviour by allowing Marianne to believe that - she ""deserved it"". As a result Marianne has problems in life generally and in particular in forming lasting relationships of the partner/boyfriend type. I think Rooney was brave to delve quite so intensely into the type of dynamics that occur - they are complicated and require a fair amount of psychological awareness and also a delicacy of writerly skill in portraying the interactions between Marianne and specifically Connell - who is the boy that she falls in love with - at school.I also admire Rooney - for bringing up the psychological problems of boys - in what would generally be considered a very macho environment. Eric as he matures apologises to Marianne for his bullying behaviour in school. Rob, another boy from school commits suicide - which affects Connell dramatically who spins into a deep depression - and bravely seeks counselling from the university services. I felt it was a deliberate part by Rooney to not simply focus on the female as victim, but to also look at how perpetrators have serious problems of their own to deal with, and specifically to focus on young men in general - the pressures on them to behave and act in specific gender ingrained patterns which are not conducive to their well-being. She clearly has an agenda.Sometimes the character delineation was a little flat - especially Connell, but this was developed into strong writing towards the end - in particular the funeral scene - where he has to sit down, after shaking the hand of the bereaved father. His current girlfriend Helen looks away at this display of ""not keeping it together"" - she feels embarrassed by him. So these dynamics I thought were quite original. It's not easy to define where and what behaviours are not socially acceptable and of course why - so here we have Rooney doing a remarkably good job."

I've been staring at my bedroom lamp for a good minute now and my eyes are blurry and hurting as I write, but I feel like I have to be  at least  feeling something.. anything.. because this book definitely robbed me off all my emotions.

 I don’t know why I can’t be like normal people. 

I understand how people can hate this book so I tried reviewing it but deleted and just finally settled for this short one because..this book is hauntingly realistic. its definitely realistic and sad but good like raw sushi good even if it leaves an aftertaste in your mouth. the main girl here, marianne, is so depressing and hard to follow through. she always liked giving and giving and hurting herself and letting people off even if they exploit her and it makes me want to run to her side and shout to everyone fuck off. LIKE GO AWAY. and the worst and saddest part of it all is she knows it. she knows it and is smart enough to do something about it but doesn't because she feels like she deserves being trashed and dirty and broken and unlucky. to embed to someone that they are unworthy is honestly the worst of it all. no matter who the person is. I don't even want to talk abt connell because I understand wanting to be accepted but still. just.. still. 

 She’ll be the same person, trapped inside her own body. There’s nowhere she can go that would free her from this. A different place, different people, what does that matter? 

2 stars? 5 stars? 4.5? 10? its bad but good and good but bad but god be damned. I loved it."

For a moment I really thought I wasn’t affected by the ending but ohhhhh boy was I shocked. I was surprised and startled to realise that was the end to the book. I’m going to pretend that their year separated from each other does them immense good and they come together and live happily ever after. Whooo this book really carved it’s damage into my soul. This is so unfair it’s unbelievable and makes me want to scream in frustration! And for what?!?She did everything for him. EVERYTHING. I feel like everyone just used her and exploited her kindness. She remained loyal to a fault. She’s always been there for him. By his side. The fact that annoys me the most is she had such little — and rushed — character development it upsets me to my core. Whereas, Connell had a beautiful growth in character which I could see take it’s form. He made her feel worthy — so stay! He LOVES You!This book was really depressing but it crept under my skin. There were also so many parts about the book that I loved and found cute, parts that I found severely annoying (her brother and mother and friends), some I even found shocking ( when he thought he had the power to hit her and she would let him) and parts that I found really fucking sad 😢 This was rigorous on my emotional health. Maybe there was a reason she might not have turned out completely fine. Maybe the reason Connell felt/ had a sounder life was because he went to therapy and she didn’t. But he was good to her. And so was she dammit!I guess life is not fair but in my mind they get back together. He comes back. They’ll find their way back to each other, just as they have been since it all began. Like it’s was inevitable."

Why does nobody talk about how..... weird this novel is??? I don't mean this in a necessarily bad way but the entire story feels so strange and otherwordly to me, even though it essentially depicts the lives of two very ""normal"" (which is a very subjective term, I am aware) people. I guess what I'm saying is that I don't know how to review this book, because I'm not entirely sure (yet) what I'm supposed to have gained from it. I'm not sure if I'm even supposed to feel anything or if I am expected to simply take the role of an observer; merely following connell and marianne along on their journey and then moving on to something else. I don't think I know exactly what to say here, which probably becomes apparent the more I ramble on about nothingness, so I'd like to just shut up now. Yeah, sorry, I do not possess one single coherent thought about Normal People and maybe I never will or maybe I just need to absorb it all for a while and then come back when I'm older and wiser and have learned how to form opinions on things that kinda confuse me."

I found myself caring for Marianne and Connell who both reminded me of my own self-absorbed, insecure early adulthood. I think Rooney nails it.

Still, it is hard for me to tell my feelings because I am still confused. And as you can see, no PROS and CONS this time.I feel like I absolutely loved this book, but at the same time, I absolutely hated it! And honestly I feel like it's near to impossible to explain myself, but I will give it a try in hope that at least some of you will understand something. Also, it seems to me that I am kind of a freak 😅 People either loved it or hated it, and me... I am just sitting in the middle of the shit pile. • First of all, let me tell you this. I have no idea how others felt, but for me was like I just pushed myself, uninvited, in these two people's lives, Marianne and Connell. It felt like I was a voyeur (is this the right term? If not, oh, hell... Pardon me!) in their lives, spying on their intimacy and most hidden thoughts and feelings. While it wasn't a complete nightmare, my masochist and very well hidden part, enjoyed this! (Now it's not anymore that well hidden, but... hell, we already had some sexual content here, so don't mind my ""confession"" !).• Another matter is that I don't feel like the characters were developed over time. They both are almost on the same line as to how they started, with some obvious little differences. This may seem a negative point, and I don't say it's not, but here is the fun part. It was really interesting to see how the time passed and our characters remained almost the same, how they kept going each one on their way just so they can end in the exact same point every single time. Pretty nice circle with some bus stations, huh?! • The writing style was... Oh, man... How do I say this? Exhausting?! Yup, exhausting is the right word to describe it. Again, I am admitting that yes, I am a slow reader. But still! This book sucked every second of my free time and spare brain cells! I mean, it wasn't even 300 pages long, I think it was actually around 250, but it sure as hell felt like I was reading a thousand pages long book! It is exhausting even to write this review, so I think I am gonna call it a night and finish here. For now. But don't be surprised if I pop up sometime later to add something else.

I feel a bit bad about that view now, since I ended up loving it! I think my mood had a lot to do with it -- if I'd been feeling more impatient or cynical at the time of reading I would have found Connell and Marianne irritating, especially during their particularly self-absorbed moments. I did find them difficult to like, but in a way that made them feel real, and made the book tense and engaging. I do think though that I preferred them when they were separate from each other --- I didn't really care too much about whether or not they would end up together. I did find Marianne's complete subservience toward Connell alarming and was a little perplexed about why she felt this way, without question, from the very beginning of their relationship. Sometimes I did question if Marianne was as vulnerable as she was supposed to seem. Or rather, is she really more vulnerable than anyone else? Aren't all people vulnerable, at risk of being used or let down by people around them? Why does it count more if the person in question is Marianne?I've thought about it a lot the past few days, and I'm not sure that there was ever a moment where I found either of the two main characters personable, but I loved the way the book was written and found that it didn't really matter. Neither of them was someone I would actually want to interact with but I was very engaged with their thoughts and observations. I clicked quite well with the odd mix of the book feeling very intimate and also detached. I watched the TV adaptation over the last few days, and experienced the struggle that I had anticipated with the novel: I couldn't connect to either one of the main characters, and not only did I not care about their relationship, but I didn't care about the other things that they occasionally concerned themselves with. While I liked both the actors, and had moments where I thought, ""Yes, that scene was well done"", I was disinterested most of the time. I did love the actress who played Joanna, and wished she had had more screen time. I watched to the end, and the final episode was my favourite. It spent more time on certain things, the final scene was very good. I also liked most of the outfits that Marianne wore ---- from university onwards anyway."

Life was different after that; maybe he had never understood how different it was.”Going into this book, I didn’t really think I would like it. But that immediately changed like 10 seconds into the book. The first page had me hooked and it was already so meaningful and insightful. To me, this book is partly a romance that builds between Connell and Marianne, but it was also so much more than that.It really showed the ins and outs of a relationship, and all the ups and downs. The book showed and told a lot about how someone could affect someone else’s life in so many good ways, but also in some sad ways. It also showed the struggle of mental health, and it was written in such a unique way, that I actually felt for both Connell and Marianne. To be honest, this book was so raw and deep, it was truly captivating and I loved it. There were so many things in this book that I just kept thinking on and on about, especially the conversations between Connell and Marianne because it was so different and interesting. “People can really change each other”Connell and Marianne have a special connection, that no matter what it always brings them back together. It was so enthralling to read their relationship over a span over 3 years, and the interactions between them were so interesting! The ending got me shocked, and now sitting here while reading this review, I’m still thinking about Connell and Marianne and their progress throughout the book."

256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75953902-sahil-javed,Rating 5 out of 5,"Normal People follows Marianne and Connell, from teenagers in highschool through to adults in college and university, as they navigate the intense relationship they have with each other over the course of their lives. This book focuses on friendship and intimacy and how one person can have the power to change and affect your life. 

“Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn’t know if she would ever find out where it was and become part of it. She had that feeling in school often, but it wasn’t accompanied by any specific images of what the real life might look or feel like. All she knew was that when it started, she wouldn’t need to imagine it anymore.”

Even as I was reading this book, I knew I was going to find it hard to review, and that’s not because I didn’t enjoy it, because I absolutely did, it was an amazing book, but mostly because I didn’t really know what I wanted to say. The books starts with Marianne and Connell forming a secret relationship in high school. Connell is the popular guy in school whereas Marianna is more of an outcast who is ostracised by her peers. Once they get to college, the roles are reversed and it is Marianna who fits in more socially whereas Connell begins to feel awkward and remains on the sidelines at social gatherings. I really, really enjoyed the way this book was written and the way it explored the complexities of a long term relationship between two friends who are at a total contrast when it comes to their social standing and lives. It explored intimacy and the way we view ourselves through the opinions of others and it focused massively on just how much one person can change and affect your life. 

“How strange to feel herself so completely under the control of another person, but also how ordinary. No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.”

The characters were really complex and interesting and developed throughout the novel. Marianne was a really complex character who made me feel a lot. From being emotionally and even physically abused by her family, Marianne then develops this over reliance on Connell and allows him to have this weird sort of power over her. That made me feel uncomfortable, especially because it was obvious through reading from Marianne’s perspective that she pretty much would have let Connell do anything to her. I mean, at one point she says that she’s aware that she would lie down and let him walk over her if he wanted. That sort of unequal power balance in their relationship made me feel uncomfortable for Marianne but it also made me understand her character more, such as why she had such an over reliance on Connell. It was through the relationships she developed with other characters that I discovered more about her own character and identity.

“It’s funny the decisions you make because you like someone, he says, and then your whole life is different. I think we’re at that weird age where life can change a lot from small decisions. But you’ve been a very good influence on me overall, like I definitely am a better person now, I think. Thanks to you.When we were together in first year of college, she says, were you lonely then?No. Were you?No. I was frustrated sometimes but not lonely. I never feel lonely when I’m with you.Yeah, he says. That was kind of a perfect time in my life, to be honest. I don’t think I was ever really happy before then.”

Connell was also a really interesting character but he was frustrating at times, especially when he cared too much about what other people thought of him. From the very beginning, with the way he reacted to Marianne being upset over his behaviour in high school, it was clear that although Connell is a nice person, there were times where his behaviour wasn't nice, from taking so long to apologise to Marianne to even referring to her as damaged. Sometimes I felt uncomfortable reading about his opinions of Marianne but at the same time I think they need one another just as much as each other. The biggest problem I think these two characters had in their relationship was miscommunication. They never communicated properly and although it got better towards the end of the novel, it was the reason they had so many problems in the early portion of their relationship.

“He had just wanted to be normal, to conceal the parts of himself that he found shameful and confusing. It was Marianne who had shown him other things were possible. Life was different after that; maybe he had never understood how different it was.”

I enjoyed this book a lot. It was a complex look at the dynamics in a relationship between two people who are complete opposites. I have to say that I did find the ending a bit abrupt and I actually thought I had a faulty copy which had a few pages missing. But after thinking about it, I understand why the novel ended the way it did, and it also speaks volumes about the way the relationship between Marianne and Connell was left. I think both of the characters realise that they are their best when they are with each other and although Connell is aware that he is in love with Marianne, I think it was Marianne who realised at the end just how much of a big part Connell played in her life and how she was feeling.

“For a few seconds they just stood there in stillness, his arms around her, his breath on her ear. Most people go through their whole lives, Marianne thought, without ever really feeling that close with anyone.”

Overall, Normal People was a really interesting novel that had such complex characters. After this, I’ll pretty much read anything Sally Rooney writes."

260,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11889829-suz,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was on my radar forever. I watched the series, then quickly jumped on to the audio. I LOVED both. The show was so true to the written form, I could hear it as I went straight from one to the other. So much of the dialogue word for word. I'm not sure what I'd make of the book had I not watched the series, but I don't at all mind that I watched the adaption first. The two young people in this story find their 'person'. Both emotionally fragile and quite flawed, so much gets in their way as they are young and don't see (right away) what doesn't matter in life, particularly Connell who is swept up in appearance and what his peer group think - although we see his inner self as quite the opposite.He pretends to not know Marianne outside of school as she is the high school pariah. Brilliant but shunned, given her sharp and acerbic wit, a woman who truly does not care about the opinion of those around her, teachers and students alike. I loved a quick retort to a teacher about looking out the window in class, she will not suffer fools. Through this brilliant writing, Sally Rooney shows the audience the normality of life in a lyrical way. Both characters suffer anxiety and depression, Marianne due to a terrible family life, via continually heartbreaking scenes throughout. There is abuse and tones of a terrible loneliness and a disconnect from her family, which causes a general disconnect from life as well. This is throughout the novel, and the reader captures this so easily through innate author skill.Connell, who seems never to be able to entirely lift himself above the fog of feeling outwardly from his own existence, keeps his head above water ever so minutely, trying to be a part of society, but always feeling less than. Marianne is similar, but never cares as much. The basic premise of two wonderful characters meeting at school and revisiting each other months and years apart as each go about their education may seem quite plain, but the story is not. It is beautiful and intricate. Both individuals have such depth and beauty in their normality it is impossible to not be drawn in. What they experience from their initial sexual connection and friendship is completely obvious, and equally sad as they miscommunicate over the years and each suffer and struggle with their lives. Never wavering in support or love, it becomes quite inevitable and sad (for this reader) how it will end. Connell's mother was a beautiful soul, as a cleaner for the wealthy family for Marianne, she was Marianne's hugest advocate while clearly loving her son, dispending much life wisdom. Marianne not so fortuitous, going things alone much of the time without familial support.I loved the ah ha moments from each as they realised how little the past mattered, and that many friendships with university and high school friends were not real. Connell and Marianne were always real to each other. Connell would say to Marianne many times 'I love you', I could feel it always. This is a glimpse into two brilliant people's lives over a four year period where both individuals flounder, grow and mature, eventually leading to a satisfying, though extremely thought provoking ending for this reader. I discussed it in length with a work colleague, and picked it up off the shelf at work, just to see the words given I listened to the audio version. As Connell remarks to Marianne that he was only truly happy during their time at school, before their life journeys and circumstance pulled them apart, I was gutted emotionally in my reading process. I stood still and pondered. This is such a sign of a brilliant read. If you haven't been lucky enough to have crossed paths with this beautiful book, I wholeheartedly recommend that you do."

Vì vậy đọc ""Trà Hoa Nữ"", ""Đồi Gió Hú"" hay ""Kiêu hãnh và định kiến"" ta cũng sẽ thấy hay đấy, thú vị đấy nhưng ít nhiều sẽ cảm thấy hơi lạc điệu với đời sống hiện đại. Vậy giới trẻ hiện nay yêu như thế nào, câu hỏi có lẽ chỉ có chính người trẻ trả lời được, với Sally Rooney - tác giả người Ireland sinh năm 1991 - cùng với tác phẩm được đánh giá rất cao ""Normal People"" khi lọt vào đề cử Man Booker năm nay và nhận được rất nhiều lời khen của các nhà phê bình, thì tình yêu thời nay có lẽ đang là trào lưu của on/off romance.Chúng ta hãy nhìn lại cách chúng ta yêu bây giờ, phải chăng xung quanh có rất nhiều sự lựa chọn nên ta rất dễ dàng dao động, dễ bị say nắng dù đã có một người mà ta nghĩ là dành riêng cho bản thân mình, và rồi giữa bộn bề bao nhiêu thứ trong đô thị chật ních người, ta rơi vào cảm giác cô đơn và cảm thấy tình yêu của đối phương không đủ để bù đắp lại sự trống vắng mênh mông trong lòng, không đủ để chữa lành những vết thương và ta lại quyết định ra đi để tìm một người nào khác và rốt cuộc lại vỡ mộng vì chẳng có ai có thể cứu vớt ta khỏi cuộc đời cô đơn lạc lõng mà ta đang đối mặt, và chính bản thân người đó cũng đang chiến đấu để thoát khỏi nỗi cô đơn vây kín. Connell và Marriane, thông minh, trẻ trung và dường như họ biết phải làm gì với cuộc đời mình thế nhưng cái thế giới điên rồ xoay vần này khiến họ sầu thảm, họ tìm đến nhau, chia sẻ nỗi niềm, hẹn hò, hôn và cả làm tình nhưng họ không gọi nhau là người yêu, họ không đặt tên cho mối quan hệ của mình dù trong sâu thẳm họ biết mình thuộc về người kia, họ vẫn muốn cái gì hơn nữa và muốn tìm hiểu những người khác, và rốt cuộc họ làm tổn thương nhau và tổn thương chính mình. Họ chia tay, cặp kè với những người khác, họ bị những người đó làm tổn thương, rồi lại quay lại gặp nhau để tìm cách hàn gắn, an ủi nhau. Mối quan hệ cứ thế kéo dài suốt 4 năm ròng (theo mốc thời gian trong sách nhưng dường như sẽ kéo dài mãi vì dù câu chuyện đã khép lại, dấu chấm cuối cùng đã được đặt thì Connell và Marianne vẫn tiếp tục lạc lối trong cái thế giới của họ - hay thế giới của chính chúng ta), và tôi cảm giác từng mảnh của trái tim cứ vỡ ra khi đọc về những tâm sự của hai con người ấy, chúng mang lại cho tôi một sự đồng cảm đến độ như thể những câu chữ ấy đã chạm đến phần sâu kín nhất trong câu chuyện của chính tôi, và những bối rối hoài nghi về tình yêu, về cuộc đời về những mối quan hệ bao lâu nay ngỡ chẳng ai hiểu bỗng được 2 nhân vật giải bày.Một cuốn sách nghe có vẻ điên rồ khi chỉ viết về chuyện tình của hai người trẻ, một chủ đề mà có lẽ đã có bao tác giả viết về nó, thế nhưng Sally Rooney là tác giả đầu tiên khiến tôi cảm thấy sự thấu hiểu sâu sắc về vấn đề này, không phải là một câu chuyện hời hợp dễ dãi trên bề mặt mà cô đã đào sâu những góc sâu kín nhất trong mối quan hệ và những nỗi bi ai khi ta phải đối mặt với quá nhiều thứ mà chỉ một quyết định nhỏ cũng có thể khiến cuộc đời ta thay đổi mãi mãi. Và Sally Rooney chỉ cho ta cái cảm giác chân thực khi ta trẻ, buồn bã, cô đơn và đắm chìm trong tình yêu, một cảm giác tuyệt nhất nhưng cũng tệ nhất cuộc đời mà ta sẽ chẳng thể nào quên được.Một cuốn sách ngọt ngào mà vẫn cay đắng, buồn thương mà không ủy mị, sâu sắc mà rất dễ cảm thông, trần trụi nhưng vẫn nên thơ, đau khổ nhưng vẫn đầy hy vọng, khiến ta vỡ tim nhưng vẫn xoa dịu. Tình yêu thay đổi chúng ta, nhưng đồng thời cũng giải thoát chúng ta khỏi bản thân mình, như cách Sally Rooney đã khiến ta một lần nữa tin vào điều đó trong cuốn sách tuyệt vời này."
262,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,Rating 4 out of 5,"What a lovely and melancholy portrait of two young people and the way their lives intertwine. This is a book of deep psychological insight and lovely prose, but the protagonists--Connell and Marianne--do not speak or behave like characters in a fancy literary novel. They behave and speak like teenagers and adults who do not understand themselves, who do not always say what they mean, who misunderstand and misinterpret. I loved the contrast of the artful close 3rd person narration with the messy, broken people at the center of it.When they are high school seniors, Marianne and Connell are not friends. Connell's mother cleans Marianne's house. She is a social outcast, someone who does not particularly care what people think of her and who has been judged as unstable, ugly, and undesirable though it's clear that she isn't really any of those things. Connell, despite his lower class, is popular and liked, a good-looking, smart athlete. But behind his facade he's deeply uncomfortable with himself, his place in the world, and he's mostly unattached to the people around him. Marianne and Connell are drawn together through forces they do not quite understand and this will continue to happen to them for several years. We learn more and more about just how deep the hurt and pain goes. Marianne's family is physically and emotionally abusive. Connell struggles with depression and is acutely aware of his lack of money or status. Marianne is oblivious of Connell's financial situation. Connell doesn't understand the self-destructive ways Marianne copes with her trauma. They bounce off one another, unable to understand what love is, how to give it, or how to receive it. We, as readers, watch them learn over several years who they are as individuals and who they are to each other.I was immediately enthralled by the way Rooney wrote about these characters. Books that consider opposing points of view are a particular joy of mine, and she deftly presented the fits and starts of the relationship through many mistakes and misunderstandings. I loved how they really were young. I sometimes find myself frustrated with everyone, only to remind myself that the characters were all 18 or 20 and isn't that how everything is then? It was so acute and wise. I wanted so much to just sit Connell and Marianne down and explain it all to them. But the way you work through your life in your teens and twenties is a difficult, trying thing and that is exactly what this book is doing. These two people, both broken but neither one really understanding their brokennness, will navigate to a place of knowing. "
263,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2967061-anne,Rating 4 out of 5,"A deep and deeply moving novel that looks microscopically at the inner lives and the intimacy of two teenagers, Connell and Marianne, and at their relationship and how it shifts over time. Their relationship starts in high school, moves on to college and after. Anyone who has lived through high school or who has been a teenager can probably relate to at least parts of this story. You know that there will be both love and pain, confusion and doubt, and lack of self worth, all par for the course of teenagers growing up and into themselves. The two of them come from different kinds of homes re: loving vs. not, poor vs. wealthy, and these dimensions add tension and layers to the their stories and lives. With reference to the title, I think Rooney has in mind that both Connell and Marianne are ""normal people"" despite neither of them feeling that way. Adolescents and adults often compare themselves to others and what they think is ""normal."" Scratch below the surface of most adolescents or families and you will find ""abnormal"" or difficult circumstances. Some people may have more difficulties than others, but feeling abnormal and wanting to fit in is the norm with most people. Connell and Marianne are lucky to have each other. Their relationship was initially a secret sexual one, but still very intimate and loving. Despite constant mistakes, misunderstandings and hurt, their love and intimacy returns time and time again as their paths diverge and and come together again. They move on into other relationships with friends and lovers but they often end up back together for brief periods of time and then drift back into their own separate lives. Throughout these weavings in and out of each others lives, they never stop loving each other, even if they are with other people, and even if they don't even realize it themselves. Through their devoted relationship they both gain insight into themselves and their lives and each is enriched. The ending is perfect.I listened to the audio version. The narrator, Aoife McMahon, was excellent."

268,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33119635-neil,Rating 3 out of 5,"It was only recently that I got round to reading Rooney's first book (Conversations With Friends) and that was really only because I was waiting for this one to be published so that I could finish my reading of the 2018 Man Booker long list. I didn’t enjoy CWF, but then I started to see positive reviews of Normal People from other GR reviewers whose opinions I value and trust. So, I approached this one in a hopeful mood: I expected it to be better than CWF and thought there was a good chance I would really like it.One out of two isn't too bad, is it?For my tastes, this book is far, far better than CWF. Perhaps this is because it is much more tightly focused on just two characters rather than the larger group in the first book. We follow Connell and Marianne through their on-again-off-again relationship that is never truly off but seems to struggle to be truly on. Both have their struggles and their issues that they battle with and we do get to see a lot of their inner worlds. They meet at the start of the book because Connell’s mother is a cleaner employed by Marianne’s mother. Connell’s mother, Lorraine, is my favourite character in the book and I really wish we had a lot more of her! Initially, you think the book is going to be simple to follow as each chapter is headed with details of how long after the previous chapter it is and which month of which year it is therefore set in. But then a lot of the story is told in flashback, so you do have to keep aware. Helpfully, most of the ""now"" stuff is narrated in present tense and the flashbacks in past tense.Like CWF (and like an awful lot of other books), this book gets darker as it progresses. And, also like a lot of other books, I felt it improved as it went along. I thought I was going to find the focus on just two characters rather claustrophobic, especially as the story darkened, but that didn’t happen. I thought I was going to find a story of two teenagers in love rather maudlin, but that also didn’t happen. Indeed, at one point towards the end Marianne asks Connell a question and it made me cry! Near the start of the book, Marianne feels a ""thrill of femininity"" when a man stares at her breasts and for a long time I struggled with that as I couldn't see how someone could write something like that in this day and age (I'll take advice from women, though, if it’s true!). But, I think that as you get to know Marianne, it starts to make some sense. I would certainly caution the heterosexual men reading the book to not take it as helpful advice for talking to girls.So, why only three stars? This is about personal preferences/taste. I have to confess that I struggle to like Rooney’s writing style. I find it bounces from the banal:The kettle comes to the boil. Lorraine sweeps the line of hairpins into the palm of her hand, closes her fist around them and pockets them. She gets up then, fills the cup of tea, adds milk, and puts the bottle back in the fridge. He watches her.to the overblown:She feels pleasurably crushed under the weight of his power over her, the vast ecstatic depth of her will to please him.Somewhere in-between would be great. And, to be fair, there is stuff in that in-between zone. That’s entirely a personal preference: it’s not about whether this is a good or bad book, just about my own reaction to it.I also began to wonder if Rooney has a colour vision issue. We have ""chlorine-white"" and we have ""Raincoats glistening in the undersea colour of street lamps"" as examples. I’m not sure what to make of these. I have a similar reaction to phrases such as ""Her body was all soft and white like flour dough"" (which I read to my wife and she went ""Ewwww…that’s creepy!"") and ""Lorraine’s eyebrows moved around"". Around?!?!Overall, I enjoyed this a lot more than I did CWF, but I didn’t think it was a great book. It was fine, parts of it were good, but I couldn’t get excited about it."

Je l'ai dévoré, j'avais envie d'arrêter de travailler pour rentrer chez moi et me replonger dans la narration, et depuis que j'ai tourné la dernière page j'y repense, encore et encore. J'ai l'impression que Marianne et Connell vont me suivre longtemps, j'aurai envie de relire ce roman, et je vais aussi aller regarder la série, bien entendu.Il est dit de Sally Rooney qu'elle est ""la Salinger de la génération Snapchat"" et autant je hais cette comparaison hyper méchante et pour elle et pour son lectorat, je suis assez d'accord. En fan de la prose de J.D. Salinger, j'y ai retrouvé ce que j'aime dans Franny and Zooey et Nine Stories. Un style lancinant, qui peut sembler au premier abord froid ou clinique, mais qui me touche profondément. Il y avait dans Normal People beaucoup d'attention portée à la fois sur les corps, sur la matérialité des personnages, et aussi sur leur intériorité, et j'ai kiffé. Je n'ai quand même pas été débordée d'émotions (genre, j'ai pas pleuré), mais je crois que c'est parce qu'il y a des tas de subtilités qui m'ont échappées, que je n'étais pas dans l'ultimate mood idéal, et il faudra que je le relise.

(PG. 232)My first Sally Rooney and maybe not my last.... I will think on this...I finished it because it was not too long. I really enjoyed the first half but by the second half I was kind of bored and ready to move on. I will agree with some of the reviews, from friends on here, that it was definitely a story about Normal People and they were normally boring. I wouldn't want to chat with them in real life. I think these people on these pages needed some drama and a better plot. Another big problem, also from a GR friend, was that the characters didn't grow. They didn't learn from their mistakes. There was no growth in their personalities. They stayed stagnant and immature. There was no outcome by the end of it. It was okay."

275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33510193-romie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have a lot, and I mean, a lot of feelings when it comes to this book. Let me try and write a full review (something I haven't done in a while but this book deserves more than a few lines).So, first I'd like to say that I buddy read this book with my friend Melanie from meltotheany and I'm so thankful I was able to read this book with her. I had an amazing time, and discussing this book with her made it even more special to me.In this book you follow two teenagers, Connell and Marianne. They've lived in this same small town in Ireland since they were born and have known each other since they were kids. Connell is pretty popular at school, he plays football and is well-loved from basically everybody. On the contrary Marianne is quite lonely, people see her as weird and too self-obsessed. On the paper they have nothing in common. Except Connell's mom, Lorraine, who is payed to clean Marianne's house. That's basically it. But the thing is, maybe they have feelings for each other, and maybe someone named Connell doesn't want the school to know about them because he's scared it'll ruin his reputation. Yeah, I know. So that's where the story starts, that's the synopsis of the first chapter for you, the basic premise of this book. They like each other, but. The 'but' is important here.I want to say that this book isn't for everybody. I totally recognise that. You have a dual narrative told in third person with no real dialogues. It took me a few chapters to get used to it, but once I did I must admit I loved it. I was talking about this with Melanie and she perfectly described this writing style: it's soothing. It's very peculiar, but it adds something to the story. I found myself unable to stop reading, it pushed me to continue, one more page after one more page.It's also a book that has a very weird timeline. You start the book in January 2011 and finish it in February 2015, each chapter taking place at a different time. It means that a lot of things happen between each chapter, but you don't know what until you read about, until you get told about it. Personally I liked it. It kept the story moving. It made it possible to have some good character growth and character development in such a short book.Something I loved about this book is how it explored unhappiness. Marianne is a very unhappy girl. Her family is abusive, she is bullied at school and once she's at college she's surrounded by people who both love her and want to make her feel like she's less than enough, people who love making fun of her in front of everybody because it makes them feel good and powerful. She spends the entirety of the book believing that she is not worthy of anything, and it broke my heart, again and again. And then we have Connell who at first doesn't seem like he could ever be unhappy. His mom is wonderful (I want to marry her), people at school find him wonderful, but then he goes to college and suddenly everything isn't so bright. Where Marianne finally finds her voice and people, Connell finds himself unable to connect with other people who aren't Marianne. At some point in the book he starts suffering from depression with suicidal thoughts, takes medicine and goes to therapy. It's very raw and if you're not prepared for it, his depression can feel like a punch because of how realistically it's described.This book deals mental health, but it also talks about sexual assault. Marianne gets assaulted by an older man once as a 'joke', because yes grabbing someone's boob is so funny, wow, hilarious, make it even funnier by grabbing the boob so fucking hard it hurts, can't stop laughing. Connell also gets sexually assaulted by one of his former teachers who made him feel very uncomfortable when he still was at school because she was obviously flirting him with him even though he was 1. her student, 2. a minor. That's illegal ma'am and called pedophilia, who gave you the right to be a teacher?When it comes to Connell and Marianne's relationship, let's say it's complicated. This book is about them trying to understand what they are for each other, what their feelings mean. But it's also about the power unbalance there is during most of the book between them. Indeed, Connell is the one having the upper hand here. We're told and shown several times that Marianne would do anything for him, even things she wouldn't want to do she'd do them if it'd make him happy. It's deeply linked with her feeling like she's unworthy, it's part of her character growth. Connell somehow knows he has this power, but I don't think he understands until late into the book how much power he actually has, and once he does it terrifies him. It's very interesting to see their relationship develops, from not really friends to lovers to strangers to best friends to partners. You see their dynamic evolves, you see them influencing each other, growing and truly understand what it means to love each other. I just found it heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time to see this relationship grow from nothing.Anyway, this is my very messy review, I'm not sure I made you want to pick up this book, but somehow (with a lot of luck) I hope I did. It's a book I had an instant connection with, it reminded me a lot of one of my all time favourite books, Franny and Zooey, by J.D. Salinger. I love the way this book ended, it made me hopeful for both Connell and Marianne.“Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn't know if she would ever find out where it was and become part of it.”"

I heard so many mixed things about this and I was excited but also dreading picking it up. It's amazing how much a book can make you feel, isn't it?This book was like a whirlwind! Despite the hype surrounding it, I went into it with an open mind and next to no expectations. I just wanted to see what it was like. This book. This. Book. Did not disappoint me. I don't know what came over me but with each page, I got more hooked and more in love with everything. The writing was new to me and so it was very refreshing. I had to get used to there being no quotation marks but after a few chapters, I got used to it completely. It's safe to say that I will read anything Sally Rooney writes. That's it.When I decided to read this book I was hoping it really was about normal people. I love books where the main characters are realistic. I love it when they're flawed. I love reading about them and actually seeing real-life situations and real emotions and flaws that we naturally all have. I loved Marianne and Connell's points of view equally. I went from indifference to being attached to both of them in the span of a few pages. What I loved most was when I'd come across a passage or a quote and it would resonate with me so strongly (there were so many moments!).This book covers so many topics and it was truly wonderful, to get all of that packed into such a small book. I loved how the book dealt with mental health. There was so much positivity around getting help and finding support and I loved that. What resonated with me a lot were the school/university discussions. I feel like I watched both Marianne and Connell grow and to see the same things that I struggled with reflected on the page. I remember when I finished high school, it felt like there was so much ahead of me but at the same time like my life was somehow over. How hard that transition can be and all the fears you carry with you. Honestly, was there any discussion I didn't like? Probably not. It went from talking about class, politics, culture, mental health, love, and everything in between.This book made me feel seen in more ways than one. I also felt a lot more than I thought I would. The pull between Marianna and Connell was frustrating and heartbreaking all at once. I don't think I've ever rooted for two people more. I mean there were times where it was exasperating but at the end of it all I couldn't help but love it. The end made me happy because it just felt like a very Connell and Marianne thing to do, but it also broke my heart. I loved their story. I loved getting to know each of them when alone and together. They were both far from perfect and aren't we all? I finished the book and was left with this profound feeling of sadness but I wouldn't have it any other way.*Sigh* Sally Rooney really captured me with this one. I know this book isn't for everyone but I personally loved it to bits. I was still thinking about it weeks after finishing it and with me, if I can't stop thinking about it then it definitely means a lot to me. Definitely looking forward to reading all her other novels! I'm looking forward to seeing this story on screen soon."

So yes, I guess it holds up for me!—————————If I read a book three times and annotate (nearly) every single page, it’s a favorite. Oh, that’s exactly what happened with me and Normal People. It’s become my only personality and, trust me, my friends tune me out whenever I mention Normal People. The first time I read this, I rated it four stars. Honestly, it would’ve been three stars if I wasn’t wrapped up in the hype. I didn’t know what compelled me to reread it, but I rated five stars the second time (even though I didn’t remember anything about the book).Which brings us to this (the third) time I read this. This was the only time when I can remember the plot and warrant why I love it so much.And here’s why, starting with my favorite parts:The characterization of Connell and Marianne is why I continue to adore this book. Their feelings and thoughts felt so human that it made me realize that my thoughts are not original. The development of the two characters and their growing maturity was so natural. Their emotions were raw yet not melodramatic. And their self-reflections always bring me close to having a mental breakdown with them.I can no longer call myself anti-romance anymore, because reading about the relationship between Connell and Marianne will be what gets me through future exam seasons.I love how all sides of a relationship are portrayed in this book. There are so many relationships in this book, but somehow, all of them felt developed. And these relationships highlight the best parts of Marianne and Connell’s relationship. This story is also beautifully written. I actually appreciate the exclusion of quotation marks, since it emphasizes how our thoughts and dialogues coexist and blend into each other. Aside from the quotations, the writing is beautiful yet simple. The descriptions were gorgeous yet not distracting. There were so many lines that I wanted to underline — which I did and made my favorite pen out of ink. What I love most about the writing is that there are so many quotable lines, yet they don’t sound cheesy or out of place. When I read Beautiful World, Where Are You? I was shocked by the amount of social commentary (not in a bad way). It turns out that I missed the commentary during my first two reads of Normal People. The themes range from social class and capitalism to self-discovery and relationships. The way these themes are written made me learn these themes with the characters. This is just so gorgeous. The 300 pages were so rich and transported me to a whole new world.my thoughts from second time reading Who’s surprised that I rated it 5 stars"

Και πάντα θα προσπαθείς να γίνεις ""κανονικός"". Όταν δύο τέτοιοι άνθρωποι ενώνονται, καμπούμ, η σχέση τους γίνεται παζλ Γκερνίκα 10.000 κομματιών. Αυτό λοιπόν είναι ένα βιβλίο για τη σχέση μεταξύ δύο ανθρώπων που δεν θα είναι ποτέ ευτυχισμένοι γιατί τα έχει πει ο Χέμινγουεϊ, η ευτυχία στους έξυπνους ανθρώπους είναι πιο σπάνια κι από τα jungle canines. Το πρώτο βιβλίο της Ρούνεϊ με είχε εκνευρίσει. Και ξεκινώντας αυτό, ήμουν στα νύχια να φουντώσω ξανά, αν και ο Βασίλης που είδε τη σειρά είπε τα καλύτερα, αλλά ο Βασίλης είναι σάχλας, ΓΕΙΑ ΣΟΥ ΒΑΣΙΛΗ ΠΟΥ ΠΟΤΈ ΔΕΝ ΔΙΑΒΆΖΕΙΣ ΤΙ ΓΡΆΦΩ. Η βασική διαφορά στο δεύτερο αυτό βιβλίο της, είναι ότι οι ήρωες είναι όντως ιδιαίτεροι χωρίς να είναι αντιπαθείς. Και κατάφερε να το κάνει αυτό, καταλαγιάζοντας τη δική της ανάγκη να δείξει πόσο ιδιαίτερη είναι. Διαβάζοντας το οπισθόφυλλο, ΈΝΑ ΑΠΌ ΤΑ 100 ΚΑΛΎΤΕΡΑ ΒΙΒΛΊΑ ΤΟΥ 21ΟΥ ΑΙΏΝΑ. ΈΝΑ ΑΠΌ ΤΑ ΚΑΛΎΤΕΡΑ ΤΗΣ ΔΕΚΑΕΤΊΑΣ. Ο Μπάρρυ για το Συζητήσεις ""... ΣΑΝ ΝΑ ΈΧΕΙ ΞΑΝΑΓΕΝΝΗΘΕΊ Ο ΤΡΟΥΜΑΝ ΚΑΠΟΤΕ..."". Και όχι. Είναι ένα πολύ καλό βιβλίο. Ένα βιβλίο ιδανικό για διακοπές, θα σε ταράξει αν είσαι 25-30, θα θέλεις να συνεχίσεις το διάβασμα μέχρι να τελειώσει. Μέχρις εκεί. Η Ρούνεϊ μπορεί όντως να γίνει μια σπουδαία συγγραφέας. Αλλά προκαλώωωω, να διαβάσετε μια συλλογή διηγημάτων που έγραψε ο Καπότε στα 20κάτι του, για να έρθετε δίπλα μου, να μου κάνετε πατ πατ και να μου πείτε σώπα, δεν έχεις μεγαλώσει τόσο που δεν μπορείς να καταλάβεις τα νέα παιδιά, απλώς το χάιπ έρχεται σαν κύμα υπερβολής και πρέπει να φοράμε μπρατσάκια."
279,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115890-constantine,Rating 5 out of 5,"Rating: 5.0/5.0This book was amazing. I loved Sally Rooney's writing and this is the first book I read for her. I know that her debut book Conversations with Friends is highly appreciated, but I did not get the chance to read that one yet. I read this book as it is nominated for the Booker Prize 2018.We follow the life of Connell and Marianne from their teens to their early twenties (2011 - 2015). This book is mainly about relationships and how complex they can get. The writing has represented the true nature of human relations in a beautiful way, very realistic and believable. I feel many people can relate to the main characters, at least partially if not fully. I loved how the author showed us the growth in the characters as they aged.Many readers might consider this book as a contemporary romance but I feel it is more than that. The beautiful thing about this book that it subtly touches on different subjects in the background of the story. It never pushes ideas or opinions on you. It lets you go with the flow of the story. The two main characters are flawed like what we are in real life, you may root for one of them more than the other but that will not make you stop of guessing if they will be together or if they are already together! Sometimes when I read a book it takes time to know that I am reading a 5 stars book, but with this book, it did not take much time and also it remained steady until the end. I loved how the author kept the ending open. This book is highly recommended and my favorite pick from the Man Booker longlist 2018. "

A thought provoking book- I kept thinking about our 2 main characters, Marianne and Connell, and their dynamics. Their relationship starts in high school. Marianne is upper class and socially awkward. Connell is lower class and popular. We follow them both through the years- with their paths connecting and diverging. The author alternates between both of them, making each a fully formed character.There is so much that haunts both of them. It was beautiful how they both found solace in each other.“Marianne is the only one who ever triggers these feelings in him, the strange dissociative feeling, like he’s drowning and time doesn’t exist properly anymore.”“Even in memory she will find this moment unbearably intense, and she’s aware of this now, while it’s happening. She has never believed herself fit to be loved by any person.”I found the title very apt. What constitutes “Normal People?” It left me much to ponder and reflect on. I love when a book does that. I don’t think this book will be for everyone, but I found it totally engrossing!!Many thanks to Netgalley, the publisher and the author, Sally Rooney for my e copy in exchange for an honest review.My only regret is that it took me so long to get to it."
281,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/165989959-deepak,Rating 5 out of 5,"A favorite. Exceptional novel. The sole reason upon my enjoyment was accounted towards fervent complexity and flaws, exuded by the characters themselves. Connell and Marianne aren't virtuously perfect people, and that's exactly where the beauty lies. No one is. Both of them going on a constant cycle of hooking up, then repelling away from each other as they clearly struggled to move on shows the power of human attraction. Not just physical, but mental. It conveys a humbling message that once your mind is fixated on someone, longing for their presence, and the idea of just craving them in your life - you are in for a ride. A good and bad one. This is why I perceived this an impactful book. It really rains reality. In a somber essence, you, I, and we all as readers and humans are undeniably indecisive and unsatisfied individuals. Mic drop. But nah, truly the fact that Sally Rooney paints realism with her pen is marvelous. Sure, the story is predictable, but the nuances of Conell's frustrating ambivalence and Marriane's trials and tribulations were delightful for me to unfold. These two characters are so human, it’s gravitating. Chracter development at its finest. I would genuinely want as much people as possible to witness this one. Last, this book is a prime example of how infatuation for certain individuals can either transform you. Or degrade you. Choose wisely."

En su arte noto la mano markentinera, la falta de riesgo, de alma, algo que otros músicos me hacen creer y él no. Este libro para mí es como un disco de Luis Miguel.Es una historia de unos romeos y julietas que ya saben que matarse por amor no tiene sentido. Van yendo y viniendo a lo largo de los meses que van del fin de la secundaria al principio de la universidad. Lo que más me gustó es su estructura, pero me siento mal diciendo esto, es como cuando en las películas se elogia un aspecto, de los mal llamados, técnicos como el vestuario o la fotografía: se sabe que la película no le resultó buena. Cada capítulo arranca con una elipsis y enseguida cae en un flashback explicativo. Volviendo al cine; hay una ley que dice que si una peli te salió plana, complicale el montaje y hacé sentir inteligente al espectador.Llegué a esta novela porque viene antecedida por varios premios y figuró en varias listas de los mejores del año, inclusive una que hizo Obama. Después, con el furor por la serie, que aun no vi, me dieron ganas de leerla.En fin, siento que estoy siendo un poco injusto porque la verdad es que la novela se deja leer y eso siempre se agradece. Toca los temas del aborto (un debate reciente en Irlanda), la violencia doméstica y el sexo grupal (ohhh), pero todo de manera tangencial, porque ya lo dice el título, estamos ante gente normal. Siento que no va a dejarme ninguna escena, ninguna reflexión, ningún personaje en la memoria. (Ya veo que dentro de unos años releo esto y me tengo que comer cada palabra).La autora, Sally Rooney, tiene apenas 26 años, si yo a su edad hubiese escrito una novela elogiada por el último presidente más o menos cuerdo que tuvo Estados Unidos, me moría en ese instante.========================================================Si te gustan mis reseñas tal vez también te guste mi newsletter sobre libros que se llama ""No se puede leer todo"".

No es la primera vez que me sucede y tengo que decir que la última fue con «Conversaciones entre amigos» de la misma autora. ¿Y qué decir? Sally, lo has vuelto a hacer, me has vuelto a enamorar y a remover todo mi ser.No quiero destriparos el contenido de esta novela así que os resumiré en grandes rasgos sobre que trata. En «Gente normal» conocemos a dos personajes que son de todo menos normales, ellos son Connell y Marianne. Tienen dos vidas muy distintas, comparten instituto y una enorme atracción (no solo en el ámbito sexual) el uno hacía el otro. Si bien tienen una relación bastante tóxica en un principio (comienza cuando son adolescentes) terminas por comprender el porqué de esta situación.Los protagonistas de la historia son en realidad lo único importante de la trama. Son como dos imanes que por más veces que se separen vuelven a unirse irremediablemente. Cada uno de ellos tiene algo diferente y especial, tienen sus traumas, sus manías y unas personalidades difíciles de entender. Pero no puedo llegar a explicaros lo mucho que me han hecho sufrir. Son tan reales y vulnerables que es prácticamente imposible no sentir en propia piel sus sentimientos. Además pecan de imperfectos, tienen muchísimas inseguridades, miedos y dudas y por ello para mí son perfectos (suelo ver la auténtica belleza en la gente imperfecta, aquella tocada y que puede resultar extraña para los demás).La pluma de Sally es de lo mejor que he leído en los últimos tiempos, amo sus pausas, sus diálogos y la manera en la que nos cuenta lo cotidiano haciendo de ello algo maravilloso. He devorado sus páginas, necesitaba saber más y más del destino de estos personajes que se van a quedar conmigo para siempre.Espero tener más libros de esta maravillosa escritora pronto, no la dejéis pasar: su narrativa puede derretir cualquier corazón helado y puede descolocar cualquier mente cuadriculada y recta. Leedlo, sin prisas, sin pretensiones, dejaos sorprender por una novela simple, intimista y con una narración sublime y exquisita."

In Sally Rooney’s sophomore book, two of these normal wannabes come from small town Carricklea—Marianne, a clever, quixotic, not very cool loner and Connell, the working-class popular kid whose mother cleans house for Marianne’s mother.The novel is a character study of the two, a dissection of the very meaning of love, an observation of how quickly things change and how difficult it is for things to come together. The reader can see that Marianne and Connell are good for each other but they keep getting in their own way with absurd quarrels and even more absurd other partners. Consider this line about Connell: “He and Marianne are like figure-skaters, improvising their discussions so adeptly and in such perfect synchronization that it surprises them both.” The novel is filled with little gems like that, each succinctly revealing a little more about these (it appears) star-crossed lovers.As in her sublime Conversations with Friends, Sally Rooney does not shy away from the truth of her characters or whitewash her scenes. Marianne willingly lets – even encourages – Connell to explore her body, only to sense his shame in letting his school chums know that they are “an item.” Marianne excels at Trinity College in Dublin where Connell is the quaint working-class scholarship case And there continues to be a danse a deux – coming together, pulling apart, almost making it, crashing away, and on and on it goes. We root for these characters, we want them to be happy and we often sigh as they don’t see the forest for the trees. From this point forward, I’ll read anything that Sally Rooney writes."

I couldn’t relate to the protagonists and couldn’t understand what was so “normal” about the way they conducted themselves, because I just felt they were way too confused and complicated. One could say that the girl was abused at home and that might have been the reason of the dysfunctional relationships she had with boys, but I somehow missed the complete background of this issue. I couldn’t find a single instance that could tell me why her mother behaved the way she did and why her brother mistreated her. These are some significant details that could have helped connecting the dots. Of course, Cornell and Marianne had undying appreciation for each other and their lives retracted back at various occasions , but their love never touched my heart, it always felt more physical than emotional. Also, I didn’t see the book going anywhere, the characters & circumstances stayed right where they were from the very start. Throughout reading this book, I felt like getting over with it as early as possible and was glad when it ended. P.S- Hate me if you want!"

300,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon-darth-anyan,Rating 4 out of 5,"[9/10] Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn’t know if she would ever find out where it was and become part of it. She had that feeling in school often, but it wasn’t accompanied by any specific images of what the real life might look or feel like. All she knew was that when it started, she wouldn’t need to imagine it anymore. Wow, this one really takes me back to that final year of highschool, so tired of being considered a child yet still not ready to face the world on my own terms or even having any idea in what direction I am heading. Marianne and Connell are two normal people, young and insecure, very intelligent in terms of books read but lacking still in emotional know-how. Yet these two have something more precious in the rawness of their feeling : a sincerity, an impetuousness that has not learned yet to hide behind a protective armour that will mostly keep others at bay instead of helping the wearer avoid a broken heart.Since Marianne is very smart, very shy and from an affluent family, while Connell is the popular star of the local soccer team and from the wrong side of the tracks, they act like thieves in the night and try to keep their budding romance a secret. Boys being boys, Connell tries to act tough and manages to hurt Marianne deeply, just before both leave for college. Once in Dublin, the roles reverse, with Marianne blooming socially in a circle of sophisticated new friends, while Connell’s insecurities come to the forefront. Whatever will become of their teenage love story?With he structure of the novel jumping in the timeline from one encounter between Marianne and Connell to the next, and with the generally fluid dynamic of their relationship, when either the girl or the boy are in the driving seat, this novel reminded me strongly of David Nicholls and his “One Day” story format. In my book, this is high praise for this first lecture from Sally Rooney, considering the Nicholls book and the following movie version are among my favorites. Indeed, Rooney displays a similar talent for creating the right atmosphere for romance, with regular/normal people acting alternatively clever and stupid, genuinely drawn to each other, yet apparently unable to hold on to their fleeting moments of genuine, sincere happiness.  Mais nos destinées et nos volontés jouent presque toujours à contretemps.  was the comment made by Andre Maurois that feels applicable in the case of Connell and Marianne, with the corollary that the author made me care enough about the two young people for me to wish the theory proven wrong and to somehow find a way for them to remain together. For the privacy between himself and Marianne to be invaded by Peggy, or by another person, would destroy something inside him, a part of his selfhood, which doesn’t seem to have a name and which he has never tried to identify before. Most readers will probably find something to help identify with either the boy or the girl in this romantic novel, especially given the fact that it covers the most tender period of late adolescence to young adulthood, the first time out of the parental nest and into learning that actions have consequences. In the beginning I thought Connell was basically a jerk. It takes one to know one, seeing as I didn’t act much better when I was his age, but in Connell’s defense, he is capable of learning from his mistakes. Probably the quote above about how we try to protect the things we hold most precious from the public view is the moment when I started to actually like him. It helps that at college Connell is studying literature, and Rooney has a couple of nice touches where she considers that reading books can be a useful pursuit in the formation of a personality It suggests to Connell that the same imagination he uses as a reader is necessary to understand real people also, and to be intimate with them. I liked the years spend in college by Marianne and Connell, the fact that they do not remain static as people from the start of the book to the finish line, their love for the written word but also the reverse of the medal, where the same intellectual emancipation can lead some astray. He knows that a lot of the literary people in college see books primarily as a way of appearing cultured. [...] Connell’s initial assessment of the reading was not disproven. It was culture as class performance, literature fetishised for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they might afterwards feel superior to the uneducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about. In the end, I really liked my first emotional journey guided by the pen of Sally Rooney, and I hope to read more from her. I find her voice authentic, warm, insightful, tender without becoming sappy, intelligent without trying to brag.  I even agree with the open ending, leaving the relationship still fluid, still in the balance. Much better than Nicholls’ decision at the end of “One Day”  No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.

Bizim edebiyat merakımız güncele yönelik değil, her zaman için klasiklere yöneliyoruz, ""esas edebiyat"" bizim kültürümüzde Rus edebiyatıdır, sonrasındaki eserler ve dönemler ise pek değerli görülmez. Ben bu görüşe katılmıyorum, kendimi en yakın bulduğum yazarlar yaşayan yahut yakınlarda ölenlerdir; ama yine de çağdaş edebiyatı, yani 2010-2020 arası yazılmış şeyleri pek yakından takip etmiyorum. Edebiyatı Türkçe takip ediyorsanız bu zaten çok zor, ya kendini ispatlamış, belli bir yaşın üstündeki yazarların kitapları ya da ancak Normal People gibi aşırı konuşulan, olay yaratan kitaplar çevriliyor. 90 kuşağının edebiyatı yeni yeni ortaya çıksa da, Türkiye'de bahsettiğim nedenlerle bulmak, okumak zor, sanırım benim de Türkçe yazmayan (Türkiye'de ""genç"" yazar yok 25 yaşındaki de 55 yaşındaki de aynı içi boş ağdalı üslupla yazıyor) okuduğum en genç kişi Sally Rooney, benden yalnızca birkaç yaş büyük. Ben en başta bu sebepten, Normal People'ı okumaktan büyük keyif aldım, çünkü benim kız arkadaşımla günlük hayatta konuştuğum, tartıştığım konuları romanın içinde aynen görebildim, bu elbette başka romanlarda da, bir karakter tahlili yahut felsefi bir problem üzerinden başıma gelmiş olsa da, bu romanda okuduğum ama bir klasikte asla göremeyeceğimiz şeylerin sayısı oldukça fazlaydı. Romanı okurken sürekli benimle aynı dünyadan bir yazarı okuduğum hissine kapıldım. Sally Rooney ile bir yerde oturup pek de zorlanmadan havadan sudan konuşabiliriz. Bunu herhalde başka hiçbir yazar için söyleyemem. Normal People bugüne kadar okuduğum bana en yakın kitap falan demek istemiyorum, hayır. Bana estetik tercihleri çok daha yakın olan bir sürü kitap okudum, kafası bana yakın çalıştığına inandığım bir sürü yazar oldu, yeri geldi hayatımın en önemli felsefi sorunları diyebileceğim şeyleri takıntı etmiş yazarların peşine düştüm. Sally Rooney böyle bir yazar değil, en nihayetinde bence büyük bir yazar da değil. Ama ne olursa olsun, benim ve benim neslimin hayatını içeren bir romanın yazarı ve bu kıymetli bir şey. Yirmi yıl sonra dönüp bunun büyük, hatta iyi bir roman olduğunu söyleyeceğimi zannetmesem bile, bugün kapağını kapattığımda iyi ki okudum dediğim bir roman. Ki bu da onu iyi bir roman yapmaz mı?Batı edebiyatında bir süredir postmodernizmin girift, labirentvari ve oyuncaklı, her zaman gizemli yapısından kurtulmaya çalışılıyor. Knausgaard, Ben Lerner, Elif Batuman ve burada da görebileceğiniz gibi Sally Rooney gibi yazarlar daha samimi, daha açık, elindekileri masaya koymaktan çekinmeyen bir edebiyat anlayışının temsilcileri. Bu yüzden oyunbazlık arayan okurları biraz üzebiliyorlar. Ama bu romanların içi boş olduğunu da düşünmüyorum. 20. yüzyıldan beri en temel felsefi sorunlarından biri dilin hakikate ulaşmakta oynadığı roldür, bu romanlarda da iki insanın iletişiminin mümkün olup olmadığını ve bu iletişimin -düşe kalka da olsa- nasıl olduğunu okuyoruz. Sally Rooney'nin romanı da iletişim problemini işleyen bir roman. Bu perspektiften okunmalı. Aynı zamanda toplumsal kabul, günün normal yahut anormal, hasta yahut sağlıklı anlayışlarının da etrafında dolaşıyor, sorguluyor. Son olarak şunu söyleyeyim, ben bu kitabın son derece basit ve sade olan dilinin Türkçeye çok zıt olduğunu düşünüyorum, bu yüzden eğer imkânınız varsa İngilizce okumanızı tavsiye ediyorum."

“Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn't know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it.”
I loved the idea of this book, but not the book. Sally Rooney is an excellent writer; her writing style could take some time to get used to, but it actually makes a lot of sense. From what I've heard, a lot of her books deal with miscommunication, which is a topic that a lot of people don't enjoy reading about, but that is very relatable to society nowadays. I've seen many people say that she represents this miscommunication by not using quotation marks in dialogue, which as I said before, a lot of people find annoying, but I found it fascinating.The book is about the on and off romantic relationship and friendship of Marianne and Connell, two people that come from different worlds but they find themselves only being able to be their true selves around each other. The main problem in their relationship is that they don't talk about their personal feelings and struggles, which led to miscommunication about how they felt about each other. The book talks a lot about social differences, mental health issues, and politics. I think that they're very real and relatable characters that you don't usually see a lot. Connell, for example, suffers from panic attacks and anxiety. When someone that used to be close to him dies, his condition worsens. Marianne, on the other hand, has self-esteem problems. Both characters go through situations that most people can find themselves in, so reading about them and how they try to overcome this and work on their relationship. However, as much as I loved that, the book was too repetitive. I get that it was about miscommunication, but every time they broke up it would be the same story again and again. It got boring and predictable. Also, the time jumps stressed the shit out of me. I don't know if I like the ending or not. I definitely felt a wave of huge anger when I finished the book, but it made sense?Still think Marianne should've talked to him about what SHE thought of him leaving and not just saying that she would always love him and blah blah. Do you know what I mean? I actually wanted both of them to say what they were thinking for once and not just leave things unsaid.With all that said, I think this is a great book that expresses a big problem in society, with really relatable characters. You should def check it out (don't if you don't like miscommunication tho)Also, for those who have already read it, comment your thoughts on the ending because I don't know how to feel about it.

303,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,Rating 4 out of 5,"Oh, Marianne and Connell! How can you be so perfect for each other and screw it up EVERY time??? Sally Rooney’s “Normal People” is one of those novels that I saw, turned down, saw again, turned down, and then finally decided I must read it given all the buzz. I think it’s for a younger audience; yet I’m happy I read it. Rooney is noted as an author who authenticates the millennial trials and conundrums. This isn’t a coming of age novel, and it’s a bit past a young adult novel. It’s more a novel that highlights the insecurities and issues of those in their 20’s.It begins when Marianne and Connell are in high school. If you are hesitant about reading a sexually explicit novel, this isn’t for you. I’m not a fan, and I almost gave up. But, for whatever reason, I carried on. I’m not sure about the necessity of the sexually explicit scenes other than authenticity of millennial issues. Given I’m not a millennial, it was a bit lost on me other than being a bit embarrassing to read.Getting past that though, I was transported to that insecure time of young adulthood. And Rooney especially nails it with the intimate portions. Love is a blinding emotion that is almost too harsh for young adults to be able to handle. The ability to be vulnerable without fear is a strength that young adults don’t have. In addition, Rooney shows how easy miscommunications can make insecurities even more profound.The story takes place during four years of Marianne and Connell’s life, beginning in the later years of high school through college. Even though Marianne comes from a wealthy family and Connell is raised by a struggling single mother, their social status doesn’t change the intense attraction and soul bond they have for each other. But it does affect their ideas of whether they should be together.As a reader, one is frustrated that they cannot see through their defenses and admit that they need each other. This is one of the most frustrating modern-day romantic novels written. I can see why it’s gotten all the press and has been award nominated. Rooney is special.I listened to the Audible production narrated by Aoife McMahon. McMahon is amazing."

Normal People is geared towards a younger audience as it’s filled with the complexity of young love, angst, immaturity, self-identity struggles and confusion. I could go on. Then, there’s the whole push and pull pursuit between the two main characters throughout the entire narrative. It feels endless. Readers will likely question their ever changing relationship status. Are they NOW:•friends?•secret lovers?•just acquaintances?•friends with benefits that still date other people?•exclusively dating?•no longer dating but having sex?It doesn’t matter because they don’t even know. I don’t understand all the accolades surrounding this book. I felt the story was sometimes dull, no plot existed, shallow development of secondary characters that seemed pivotal, shifting past & present anecdotes were sometimes needless and the ending was disappointing. There was no resolution for these tortured souls.Standout Quote: “From a young age her life has been abnormal, she knows that. But so much is covered over in time now, the way leaves fall and cover a piece of earth, and eventually mingle with the soil. Things that happened to her then are buried in the earth of her body. She tries to be a good person. But deep down she knows she is a bad person, corrupted, wrong, and all her efforts to be right, to have the right opinions, to say the right things, these efforts only disguise what is buried inside her, the evil part of herself.”"

310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57354360-sarah,Rating 3 out of 5,"“All these years, they’ve been like two little plants sharing the same plot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions.” Normal People is one of the most polarising books I have come across, so of course indecisive me didn't feel strongly one way or the other. There were elements I really enjoyed and those I didn't- but overall the feeling I was left with at the end was mediocrity. I feel that I may have to reread the book to entirely understand my thoughts on it, but for now I am settling on 3 stars. For the first 100 or so pages, I wasn't really enjoying the novel. I couldn't visualise the characters or the setting- which isn't something that bothers me, ever, but for some reason created a block between me and the story. I then decided to watch the first episode of the TV series to get a more solid picture in my head which really helped. If you are having a similar problem stemming around not being able to connect to the characters, seeing them in a different medium may help! I then enjoyed the next 100 pages much more (admittedly motivated by my rule that I had to reach 200 pages before watching the second episode). “Not for the first time Marianne thinks cruelty does not only hurt the victim, but the perpetrator also, and maybe more deeply and more permanently. You learn nothing very profound about yourself simply by being bullied; but by bullying someone else you learn something you can never forget.” Normal People is written in a modern, experimental style in which quotation marks are omitted. This has been a source of contention, with many people having strong feelings one way or another. I actually didn't have a problem with the concept, I thought it meant the story could be more up to interpretation and provide some interesting grey area where it wasn't clear if certain parts were in the characters' heads or spoken. However, I feel that it was actually underutilised and would have liked to see more of it. Because of that, it ended up feeling like it was a little unnecessary and didn't add much to the story- just made it a little confusing to read. As for the actual plot, I found it compelling. After getting into the story I was mostly engaged for the rest of it. There were sections where got a little tired of the repetitive back and forth between Marianne and Connell. I wasn't a fan of the section in Sweden in either. But for the most part, the chemistry and disfunctionality of our two main characters kept me hooked. It was a complex and messy relationship, but at the same time completely believable and normal. “Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn't know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it.” Overall, if you are confused about my thoughts on this book after reading my review- same. I don't even fully know what I feel. I am slowly making my way through the tv series so maybe that will help me cement my feelings. If not, I guess I will just have to reread it soon! I would be really interested to hear what you thought, did you love it? hate it? fall in the middle like me? ★★★☆☆ stars"
311,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75183808-kathryn-in-fl,Rating 4 out of 5,"In a nutshell, ""Normal People"" is an insightful story of two people from different socio-economic backgrounds, who try to create a healthy relationship and flounder. This a universal story and could be set in any era and any country. It incorporates many intriguing ingredients, abuse, self-acceptance, need for approval from various influential parties and the ability to be supportive and encouraging. The themes man against man, man against (human) nature, man against self are witnessed throughout the story in various events. This book is a thoughtful, honest and insightful analysis of why relationships that draw people together are often overwhelmed by outside circumstances. Likewise, we consider how our environment can create pain and harm, in what otherwise is sound and worthwhile to connect to another person.Connell and Marianne are both intelligent and introspective people coming into their own. Their relationship has imbalances that at times overwhelms one or the other, overshadowing those factors that bring them together. Both are a bit sensitive to the pain of their upbringing, though not obvious to the reader in the first segment of the book, as we get a deeper view into their past and look at the present, we can understand the impact of these factors on their current behaviors. Connell is strongly influenced by his peers in high school and thus he causes Marianne deep pain (although she fails to see its impact,nor the reader initially), Connell is in denial regarding this for much of the story and thus never sees how it has also impacted him. These scars become more profoundly evident, their depth is much deeper than expected haunting both, though neither have full awareness. As both mature, they journey toward and away from each other, in fits and starts. Their fears cause them to make decisions that in the long run will lead to greater pain. For some this story will resonate deeply. It did for me. Sometimes, you can't go back. The die is cast and the history to fresh and in your face. One must chose whether the effort to try and revisit the pain is worth the trouble. You may or may not agree with the decisions, but you will certainly understand the logic used to make them. This is a character study. It is a love story, much more it is about decisions made in life that focuses on the pain we hide from, much more than pursuing our dreams. You'll understand your life or that of a sibling, a friend, or a fellow passenger on the road of life on a deeper level. This road has a lot of bumps, some detours and some breakdowns. Overall, I found the journey was worth taking. Personally, I found myself liking the story more, the farther along I had gone."

I really wanted it to be one of the best books I've ever read, but… nothing.A year ago I watched the tv show and while everybody seemed to love it, for me it was just okay, so I thought: “The book is probably so much better!”.But, in fact, it’s not.I could spend hours talking about how deeply the characters are, how problematic they are, and how both of them really need to go to therapy and a new town to live in. There are moments when you can really connect with them but, at the same time, be mad at them because of their behavior. I mean, these two just needed to communicate!I get it, relationships are tough, but this was just stupid. Everyone has his/her own problems but, if you like - or even love - someone, you try to speak with him/her. I mean speaking for real, not the type of conversation you can also have with a friend from university. Besides this, the thing is that I couldn’t feel any empathy with them. It’s weird to say, but even at their worst I didn’t feel sad or just a little moved. The narration is the main cause, I suppose. Almost no dialogues and all these descriptions about their houses, their school, their thoughts. There are more explanations of what they were thinking in a specific moment than the actual conversation between each other.It’s not boring, I swear, the writing is just not for me. Even now, reading my own review, it seems I'm talking more about an essay than a novel.And the end! What the hell is that?!I'm sorry, dear Sally Rooney, did you forgot to write the last chapter or you’re just mean?

Maybe it works out with them, maybe it doesn’t. Regardless, they’re that person we keep going back to—for better or worse. Normal People explores that sort of (confusing) relationship. At its core, it’s about love—but don’t mistake it for a romance.In a small town in Ireland, Connell and Marianne meet in high school. Connell is the popular one and Marianne is the weird girl that no one wants to be friends with. Gradually, the two strike up an unlikely relationship, which continues into their college years. There, the tables turn. Now it's Marianne who is popular—even as she struggles with her demons—while Connell finds himself suddenly irrelevant and adrift.From page one, Sally Rooney drew me in. Rarely have I encountered a portrayal of a relationship—with all the vulnerabilities, insecurities, and ugly moments—that felt so ripped-from-the-pages of my own life. It’s a painful and depressing read at times, but it’s also so real. Can you handle it?Read more at: https://bookofthemonth.com/normal-peo..."

Lo digo porque hay millones de opiniones mixtas; algunas creen que este libro es una obra maestra y otras que es un chiste. Yo, la verdad, puedo entender perfectamente los dos bandos. Si estuviera en una habitación con muchas personas, y cada una de ellas dijera algo distinto del libro, ya sea elogiándolo o insultándolo, me encontraría asintiendo con la cabeza y diciendo a todos: tenés razón! Para ser más clara: comprendo porqué a la gente no le llega la historia, pero siento que eso la hace más especial para la gente que sí conecta con ella. Suena pretencioso, y en un sentido lo es, sin embargo no creo que haya nada malo en sentirse así. Hablando ya en sí, disfruté bastante la historia. La prosa de Sally Rooney es muy bella, me gusta como describe los sentimientos de cada personaje, te deja una imagen bastante clara y precisa de lo que realmente están pensando. Los diálogos -que no son diálogos practicamente- son simples pero bastante concisos, y se entienden. Pensé que sería más díficil o pesado se seguir, pero la verdad es que no. La lectura es muy fluida. Algo que me pasó es que, mientras leía y me tomaba descansos, pensaba en estos personajes y me decía ""es que a este le pasa esto y aquello."" y así. Y de repente ellos mismos me lo confirmaban! Pensaban exactamente y se definían a si mismos como yo los había analizado! No sé la razón, pero esto me dio mucha satisfacción. Literalmente me metí en sus cabezas. Connell y Marianne son muy especiales. Son trágicos, complejos, muy conscientes de si mismos. Creen que son distintos uno del otro, sin embargo no tienen demasiadas diferencias. Hay algo en ellos sumamente único que no puedo transmitir en palabras. Seguro que ellos son mejores en describirse a si mismos que yo, así que para qué me voy a gastar en hacerlo. Son personas COMPLETAMENTE NORMALES. Este libro es muy triste. Demasiado. Es DRAMA PURO. De romance no tiene nada, creo. Me dejó un vacío en el pecho, me tocó bastante y no sé que hacer al respecto. Fue muy mala idea leer este después de Indigno De Ser Humano. Ahora siento que nada tiene sentido, jaja. Ahora hablemos de cosas que no me gustaron o no disfruté. En lo personal, creo que hay ciertos temas que se tocaron muy por encima y les faltó más... ¿sustancia? El final, por ejemplo, me dejó bastante fría. Aunque sí fue bastante satisfactorio en otro sentido, no sé. Otra cosa es que los personajes secundarios son horribles, en todos los sentidos posibles. Sally Rooney tendría que haberle puesto más trabajo a eso. Fue una lectura buena, a pesar de todo. Tengo muchas ganas de seguir leyendo a la autora. No creo que llegue a convertirse en una de mis favoritas, pero sí quizás en una que espere ansiosamente experimentar otra vez, a ver qué tal, que más me podés brindar. Ese tipo de autora."

He is from a working class, single parent home. Marianne is from a wealthy family, she is equally intelligent, nerdy, an outcast at school and socially disinterested.

Throughout the book the pair weave in and out of each other’s lives, they are always drawn to each other.There is a lot of drama, but not much happens. The characters are full of awkwardness, insecurities and miscommunication yet they feel comfortable and connected each time they see each other again.I know this hugely popular book Normal People will appeal to many but I found it a little too depressing and emotional.

319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28819314-eric-anderson,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sally Rooney is a writer that stands out as the voice of young Ireland. The natural milieu of her characters are intellectual college educated women and men in their teens and twenties. From her first novel “Conversations with Friends” to her new Booker longlisted “Normal People” she presents their stories about grappling with relationships and finding a place in society with deceptively straightforward prose. While this runs the risk of appearing to have a parochial view of the world, it moreover reads as emotionally honest and engaging in a way that few writers can pull off. This new novel is the story of Marianne and Connell who come from very different socio-economic backgrounds. Connell's mother works as a cleaner at Marianne's family home. The differences in class seem an inconsequential part of their relationship at first, but as they get older it has more of an effect on how they connect to each other. The story charts the staggered journey of their bond from 2011 to 2015. You can read this novel for the insights it gives into modern life and the plight of a section of an emerging generation, but it's moreover a modern romance which meaningfully engages the reader in the characters' growth as individuals and tantalizes with the question: will they or won't they get together?

Χιλιάδες φωνές στο κεφάλι μου ακούγονται από δεξιά και αριστερά να μου φωνάζουν «μα γιατί είσαι έτσι, όχι δεν είσαι φυσιολογική, γιατί το κάνεις αυτό στον εαυτό σου» Είχα πάντα ρε παιδάκι μου αυτή την ανάγκη να κάνω πράγματα για να νιώθω φυσιολογική. Μέχρι μια ηλικία το κάνω πράγματα για να νιώσω φυσιολογική σήμαινε λανθασμένα ν’ ακολουθώ τη μάζα. Το προσπάθησα και το προσπάθησα πολύ. Δεν μπορούσα ν’ ακολουθήσω τη δική τους «κανονικότητα», το δικό τους ρυθμό. Τότε παραιτείσαι ή ψάχνεις όμοιους σου. Ανθρώπους λίγο damaged που λένε και στο χωριό μου. Όχι τόσο για να κλαίγεσαι σε αυτούς αλλά γιατί κατά κάποιο τρόπο το σύμπαν, μια εξωτερική δύναμη δεν ξέρω και εγώ τι στο καλό σας έλκει και ακόμα και αν φαντάζει αδύνατο ότι μπορεί να συναντηθείτε με κάποιο τρόπο θα έρθουν στο δρόμο σου.Στην αρχή θα σκεφτείς μα καλά τι στο καλό μαγνήτη έχω να πάρει; Δεν τους θέλω ξου ξου ξου εγώ θέλω από τους άλλους τους «κανονικούς». Όχι, όχι δε θα με ��ίξουν εμένα, θα δείξω πυγμή. Θέλω κάτι άλλο. Και το άλλο δεν έρχεται ποτέ. Και όχι μόνο αυτό αλλά συνειδητοποιείς ότι αυτούς θες τελικά στη ζωή σου. Τους «μη κανονικούς» ,τους ανθρώπους που θα ξεγυμνωθούν μπροστά σου, τους ανθρώπους που θα σε καταλάβουν, που θα είναι και στο μαύρο και στο λευκό σου, τους ανθρώπους που θα παλέψετε μαζί ν’ αγαπήσετε τους εαυτούς σας, που θα καταλάβουν αν δε θες να βγεις για ποτό το Σάββατο το βράδυ, που θα σε αφήσουν στη σιωπή σου όταν την χρειάζεσαι.Κάνω αυτή την προσωπική αναφορά γιατί ήθελα λίγο να το συνδέσω με τους ήρωες του βιβλίου. Ο Κόλιν και η Μαριάν είναι δυο αρκετά αυτοκαταστροφικοί χαρακτήρες όμως όταν ήταν μαζί όλα ήταν πολύ διαφορετικά. Σαν ένα κομμάτι του παζλ που ενώνεις τα κομμάτια. Πολλές φορές χωρις να μπορείς να εξηγήσεις το γιατί απλά δεν αρκεί. Νιώθεις ότι δεν είσαι αρκετός, ότι για κάποιο λόγο ανεξήγητο δε μπορείς ν’ απολαύσεις τις χαρές της ζωής που σου δίνονται απλόχερα. Είδα λίγο τον εαυτό μου μέσα από τους δύο αυτούς ήρωες. Από τη μια βλέπεις ότι δεν ντρέπονται γι αυτό που είναι αλλά την ίδια ώρα τους απασχολεί και λίγο ο περίγυρος, θέλουν να είναι μέρος του. Και ποιος δε θέλει άλλωστε να νιώσει άλλωστε ότι οι άνθρωποι γύρω του τον αγαπούν και τον αποδέχονται. Τα πισωγυρίσματα στη σχέση των ηρώων δεδομένου ότι τα έφτιαξαν και τα χάλασαν σχεδόν τις ίδιες φορές με τον Ριτζ και τη Μπρουκ στην Τόλμη και γοητεία υποθέτω μπορεί να κουράσουν τον αναγνώστη και ιδίως από τη στιγμή που δεν υπάρχει μια ξεκάθαρη λύτρωση στο τέλος. Τελικά ορισμένοι άνθρωποι πάντα μα πάντα θα ψάχνουμε να γίνουμε «κανονικοί». Νομίζω ότι ένας λόγος που μερικοί δε μπορούμε να πούμε ότι είμαστε ευτυχισμένοι είναι και αυτός. Το ψάχνουμε και το αναλύουμε πολύ περισσότερο απ’ όσο πρέπειΘεωρώ το ντόρο γύρω από το όνομα της συγγραφέως υπερβολικό. Το βιβλίο αυτό δεν είναι το βιβλίο του αιώνα όμως έχει αρκετές ενδιαφέρουσες εξάρσεις πάνω στο «καυτό» θέμα των ανθρώπινων σχέσεων και της λανθασμένης πεποίθησης που έχουμε μερικοί ότι είμαστε ανάξιοι ευτυχίας. Από τις αναγνώσεις που αποκαλώ guilty pleasure. Όχι εξαιρετικό αλλά και διόλου αδιάφορο. Μου άρεσε. Κόλιν, Μαριάν αν ποτέ κάνετε κλαμπ φωνάξτε με για πρόεδρο. Δεν είναι ένα βιβλίο που θα σε συγκλονίσει όμως πολλοι απο εσάς θα βρείτε τους εαυτούς σας στους ήρωες του βιβλίου. Αντέχεις;Σε αφήνω το αστείο περιστατικό για το πώς αγόρασα το συγκεκριμένο βιβλίο.

Πράγματι πάω δυναμικά, παίρνω αυτά που θέλω και στην αναζήτηση ενός βιβλίου μαζί με την υπάλληλο του καταστήματος πέφτουμε πάνω στο προηγούμενο βιβλίο της συγγραφέως. Και τότε αρχίζει η κοπέλα να μου λέει από μόνη της να φάω τα κόκκαλα μου δεν την ρώτησα προηγούμενως που έχετε το κανονικοί φίλοι, να μου λέει ότι το είχε διαβάσει και ότι της προκάλεσε τρελή κατάθλιψη και ήταν τόσο μαύρο βιβλίο που δεν το άντεχε. Εντάξει αν ημουν Χριστουγεννιάτικο δέντρο θα άναβαν όλα τα λαμπάκια. Κατάθλιψη; Μιζέρια, Μαυρίλα; Φέρτο κοπελιά. Μας έχει τελειώσει μου λέει. Τι θα πει μωρή έχει τελειώσει γαμώ την αγανάκτηση.

Φεύγω ικανοποιημένη με τις αγορές μου. Λίγες μέρες αργότερα δεν ήμουν και πολύ καλά λέω Μαρία κούκλα μου αξίζεις μια βόλτα στο πάμπλικ. Το βιβλίο ήταν εκεί."
325,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17704217-dmitrijus-andru-anecas,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sally Rooney. NORMALŪS ŽMONĖS.Pačiam šiandien sukanka 30-imt metų ir vis dar galvoju apie du dalykus: pirmiausia, kad nesu per senas tokiems kūriniams ir niekada nebūsiu, o antriausia – sulaukęs tokio amžiaus, rodos, turėčiau mokėti kalbėti, pasakoti, klausti, klausyti, drąsiai mąstyti, dalintis – komunikuoti. Bet vis tik dar didžiulę puokštę dalykų turiu išmokti naudoti kasdienybėj.Esu abstulbęs. Istoriją, kurią maloniau stebėti iš šono, nei būti pačiam jos dalyviu. Murkdžiausi kiekviename jų pasisekime-nenusisekime. Įkvėpdavau ir iškvėpdavau kartu su jais, bet jiems niekada netrukdžiau. Kiekvienas atodūsis, kiekvienas jų bučinys, kiekvienas ginčas ir kita maloni-nemaloni akimirka. Veidrodinis atspindys to, kokiais, galbūt, virtome. Kokie, galbūt, yra jaunesnioji karta. Ir kokie, galbūt, esame visi.Pasakojimas. Toks sklandus, jokių nepatogumų. Tarsi visa tai – savaime suprantama, nes taip turi būti. Vienas kitam nepatogūs, bet be vienas kito nejudantys į priekį. Tiek vienas, tiek kitas turi problemų. Komplikuoti jaunuoliai. Pasakyti vienus dalykus yra beprotiškai sunku, o kalbėti apie kitus – neįprastai lengva. Rodos, gyvūliški ir instinktyviai primityvūs dalykai yra ištariami be jokios gėdos, nepatogumo.Kada mes nusirengsime. O dabar galime nusirengti. Dabar galiu tave pabučiuoti. Tau skauda. Tai mano pirma bučinys. Tai mano pirmas kartas. Tu man patinki. Tu man taip pat patinki. Tu mane verti jaustis nepatogiai, o aš nežinau kaip tą jausmą apibūdinti, pavadinti.Galima rašyti, kodėl jauni žmonės dabar yra tokie, kokie yra. Jiems lengviau kalbėti apie akivaizdžius ir tiesmukus dalykus, tačiau nesivelti į tai, kas yra kiek giliau. Supresuotos emocijos, štai kas. Jie gali kalbėti atvirai apie seksą, jo poreikį, jo poveikį ir kitus atributus, tačiau jiems sunku pasakyti, ką jie jaučia. Jie nežino ką jausti. Jie neišmoko pažinti savo jausmų. Jų jausminė gama plati, tačiau jie neturi tam paaiškinimo ir pavadinimo. Jiems sunku suprasti tai, ko pavadinimo nežino. Sunku, kai tai, ką jauti, yra neįvardijama. Tuomet jausti tampa ypatingai sunku.Sally Ronney yra gaivus gurkšnis. Saulėtas spindulys vėjuotam paplūdimy. Aš ją suprantu, supratau. Ji jauna, mano amžiaus. Žinau, apie ką kalbi. Žinau, ką jauti. Ir nepaprastai didžiuojuosi, kad parašei. Apskritai, tai tarsi kelionė nuo baigiamųjų mokyklos klasių iki tuomet, kai baigi studijas ir pradedi pirmuosius darbus. Autorė drauge nukeliauja per visas jaunimo-vyresnio jaunimo stoteles, rodo, kaip mentališkai (nežinau, ar toks žodis yra) pereinamos fazės. Nori nenori ir tu tame.Be tų dažnai jaunimui pasitaikančių problemų, tai buvo kalba apie tai, ką taip sunku įvardinti. Tas šiuolaikinis dramblys kambary. Nejaugi taip sudėtinga yra būti atviram? Parodyti savo emocijas? Būti pažeidžiamam? Pamilti kitą? Priimti tokiu, koks esi/yra? Nekeisti? Nesigėdyti? Kalbėti? Mėginti? Pasakyti tai, nes vienaip ar kitaip likimas suves, tik ar nebus iššvaistyta brangaus laiko?„ <...> bet tyčiodamasis iš kito sužinai tai, ko niekada neužmiršti.“Rekomenduoju. Viešai turėčiau parašyti, kad tai jaunimui skirta knyga, nors riba ypatingai slydi ir plona. Aš, suaugęs, radau joje daug. Aš aš aš. Koks tai natūralių, nepadidintų, neperspaustų, realių jausmų ir emocijų kratinys. Jaučiuosi privilegijuotas, nes perskaičiau apie tai, kas pačiam dažnai labai kimba ir neduoda ramybės – save patį, savo jausmą, savo būvį, savo tikslą, savo kelią.Ir vis tik pačiai pabaigai. Tikėjau, kad tėveliai ir mamytės turi jaustis atsakingai parodant savo atžaloms visas galimas gyvenimo emocijas. Parodyti ne tik žodžiais, bet ir savais veiksmais. Ir jeigu dabartinė karta yra tokia, kuriai sunku ekspresyviai komunikuoti tai, ką jie jaučia (išreikšti tai žodžiais ir veiksmais), tuomet klausimas – kur liko spraga jų auklėjime ir kaip tai atsilieps sekančiai kartai?"
326,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I live in Dublin, where Rooney lives, and her books have already, in only a year, taken on the status of instant Irish classics. Other writers I enjoy, such as Anne Enright, among others, have touted Rooney as a writer of rare gifts. I couldn't wait to crack this open. But by page 50 or so, I was a bit lost as to why there was so much acclaim. I assumed the book would pick up. It never did.Have you seen the great 1987 film ""Can't Buy Me Love""? Take that film, slightly shift the dispositions and fates of the characters, and you have this novel. They're nearly identical. I love that movie, but I didn't need to read it as serious literature 31 years later. The characters are cliche to no end. Their values, their ideals, their political perspectives; if I were to scan Irish millennial twitter accounts, I could use the forced and tired tweets of the mob to easily construct these characters and their viewpoints. The problem? Real people don't live on twitter, they weaponize it. In real life, people are far more nuanced, far more problematic. For example, not one character in the book held to a political perspective that would shock the Irish millennial twitter brigade. Their views were all copied out of the playbook. But, I know many Irish millennials, and in real life their views are not so clean. They know that issues are fraught with complexity, and they are smart enough to hold to varying viewpoints. I would have LOVED it if one character held even a slightly nuanced political view. And what about the archetypes? Everyone in Sligo was similar; a self-conscious, shallow lout. Everyone at Trinity was similar; a self-obsessed faux intellectual. And, of course, the main character, Marianne, believes that ALL men would rather sacrifice their freedom to control women than live free and be a decent person. Does the book ever show that many (most) men aren't that way? No, it leans into this idea - every man in the book except Connell is a sadistic, abusive menace. The prose was as rigidly plain as the characters. Even among others who have not really cared for the book, I've at least heard them say, ""Well I at least liked her style."" I don't get that. Honestly, this book reads like a YA novel that got shuffled along as adult lit because the some of the scenes were too graphic for the YA scene. Think Rainbow Rowell with language. As I read, I found no distinctive style, no unique voice to speak of. The prose was crisp, and clear, to be sure, and Rooney definitely understands how to construct a structured narrative (the one grace that made the book easier to get through), but the writing was, in my opinion, completely nondescript. Lots of sentences of people doing things, with no flair to the prose at all. Am I being harsh? I hope not. I'm sure Rooney is a wonderful person, and I see lots of promise of a good writer. My reaction has more to do with her acclaim than herself, and that's not at all her fault. But I LOVE new Irish voices, and I love reading through books on the Booker long list, so when I cracked this book I was genuinely shocked by the formulaic nature of the book. I'll be the first to admit that I'm in rare company here, as nearly everyone on earth thinks she's a marvel. I'm happy to simply ""not get it."" But I don't."
327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151042854-lea,Rating 1 out of 5,"just nope. what i got from the hype around this book was that it would be a raw, emotional, relatable portrayal of two people (basically people that could have been right out of my own life) and how they get through life, all while life finds a way to bring them back together everytime. umm.. i feel like i got scammed. and the fact that i wanted to read this book before i get to the tv adaptation but do i honestly look like i'm gonna watch that show now lmao 😭i love character-driven books and i really don't mind if there is little to no plot but when you combine that with annoying and pretentious, downright unlikeable characters.. no, thank you. i mean connell was just.. there.. but marianne, oh boy, she genuinely didn't have a personality trait other than being painfully pretentious and submissive due to past trauma?? which was portrayed in such a shallow manner and then resolved in like a day? ngl, sally rooney's portrayal of mental health kinda left a bad taste in my mouth. on top of that, marianne was just simply annoying and her POV was an absolute pain to get through. i honestly should've dnfed this at the beginning when i saw no quotation marks tbh. that should've been my first sign that this was just gonna be a soulless and pretentious book that is trying way too hard to be something it isn't.though this book is unique in a way. never before has a book left me this cold and emotionless, the only thing it made me feel was that this was a complete and utter waste of my time. not sure if something is wrong with me or i'm just too dumb to understand the ""artistry"" behind this. i couldn't connect with any of the characters, their journey, their relationship or the writing style. is this really supposed to be relatable? i mean, yes, it was quick and easy to read, but at what cost? i couldn't find anything to enjoy or relate to? like at all? i kept thinking this book definitely has to get better, or at least that the ending is gonna redeem it surely? and then i reached the unsatisfying non-ending and i'm just like this is it? i finished this book devoid of any feelings at all, i just sat there like oh.. ok.i've seen people saying they got emotional and cried and i'm just genuinely wondering at what part? where?? i mean i was close to crying from how boring this book was but i don't think that counts. it's just reading the same thing over and over and over again about two obnoxious and boring characters. i really don't get the hype around sally rooney but props to her cause her books seem to be working for other people. needless to say i definitely won't be reading anything by her again."
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13862041-gillian,Rating 5 out of 5,"reread: I like to believe that Salley Rooney’s books and I are fated because I could’ve been born in the 1800s and die not knowing the existence of such an incredible book/author. But here I am, living in the same era as her while I also get to watch the adaptation of Normal People. How blessed am I?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~first read:I AM SO EMOTIONAL AND FRUSTRATED AND ANNOYED AND EXHAUSTED AND REALLY REALLY SAD RIGHT NOW. 
""I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know why I can't be like normal people.” 
There's this part in the book where Connell expressed himself as being moved by literature in a way that he's all wrapped up in the drama of fictional characters. One of his professors called it 'the pleasure of being touched by great art'. And that basically sums up my current state after reading this book. I AM TOUCHED BY GREAT ART and I'm gonna go on for days thinking about Marianne and Connell.Normal People is a love story about two complex and flawed individuals who were trying to figure out themselves and find love in this seemingly broken and fucked up world. Marianne and Connell’s relationship lacked communication. It's filled with angst and bottled up emotions, lots of sex (not graphic), and a series of unofficial breakups and getting back together a million times.Everything about their relationship is frustrating and emotionally draining. I reached a point where I had enough and I didn’t want them to end up together. But the moment they started dating a different person, I had never felt so hurt. I realised I wanted them together after all. 
”All these years, they’ve been like two little plants sharing the same plot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions.”
This is my first Sally Rooney book and it's definitely not my last. Her writing is captivating and it drew me in immediately. The plot is fast-paced which fared for me well but might not be the case to some. The lack of quotation marks also bothered me at the start but as I read more, I got used to it and I didn’t even notice its absence.Overall, I'm not entirely sure why I love this book because I surely did not enjoy how it played with my emotions. But I love Normal People and I might've found myself a new favourite author."
329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120212580-ananya,Rating 3 out of 5,"Hmm so I have some thoughts... I didn't love this but I didn't hate it either. This was the most frustrating, depressing and humanizing book I've read so far this year. If you're going into this book thinking it's a romance where two healthy people do good things, you're not going to like it because that's not what this is, it's more so an exploration and discussion on money, class, and relationships that is written in a very witty manner. I loved the first half but in the second half it dragged and became almost plotless and I have enjoyed books that don't have much of a plot but this was just a bit I don't know lacking perhaps. I did understand this was a poignant perspective on relationships but at the end of the day, it was just a bunch of white people hooking up. Some parts made me uncomfortable like Marianne's sexual submission and I also didn't like how we didn't get a resolution on Connell's mental health struggles and depression and I know that it's not necessary for someone to have a conclusion to their mental health struggles but it was like his mental health was mentioned once and then never again. I loved the ending though which might be an unpopular opinion but that made the story feel more real. Normal People would have been a two-page book if our MCs weren't as terrible at their communication skills.One thing I would like to mention is that I loved Sally Rooney's writing, it was stunning. Prior to reading this I always thought that you have to include quotation marks in your writing because it's basic punctuation but Sally Rooney doesn't use them and I feel that worked perfectly for the story. And since I loved Sally's writing so much I'll give her books another chance!Overall this wasn't something life-changing or something that left a lasting impact on me but it's still a good book. I think if you're in your early 20s feeling lost and don't know your place in the world you'll enjoy this.⇢3.25★________________________Starting this today. I feel like you either hate Sally Rooney or you love her so I'm excited to see which end of the spectrum I land on.________________________So Taylor liked this...so it's obviously now my duty to read it"
