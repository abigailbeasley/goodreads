And the underlying morale of the four stories is basically highly conservative in my opinion.The underlying messaging that grated on meTo kick off in respect to my last sentence I mean the following:The first story feels so old fashioned, with a girl crying over being left by a guy and this just continues. I mean the geek boyfriend of a stunningly beautiful girl gets a job in the US (with a game studio of all things) and then his career is in her mind suddenly more accomplished than hers? She works in medical engineering for a listed firm; she is a manager and can supposedly speak 6 languages, but can’t even normally articulate her needs and opinion to him apparently? And then she realizes that happiness lies on waiting for her non-communicative boyfriend to return. The end.In the second story a women just naturally sees herself as a nurse for her husband and is treated quite unappreciatively by him. This story did have heart and I am not going say much negative about this one.While in the third story a man thinks of a gynecologist as a woman’s domain, where no man should venture. And an independent woman learns that the secret to happiness is paying heads to her family’s wishes and giving up her own business.Fourthly and lastly we have a woman ignoring health risks and being praised for that.Would make a fine Netflix series, but as a book did not work for meNot to be mistaken, the concept is nice, but the execution sloppy. Also after the first story the newness of the premise starts to wear off (despite some arbitrary rule changes all of the sudden) and things like the weirdly specific descriptions of people, focussed solely on the colour of their clothes, started to catch my eye. An example:A woman entered the cafe alone. She was wearing a beige cardigan over a pale aqua shirt-dress and crimson trainers, and a white canvas bag.More annoyingly, Toshikazu Kawaguchi explains everything the characters feel, making the stories overly simple and sentimental. Somewhere the following passes someone’s mind: But none of those feelings could be formed into words.But there are literally two paragraphs before that exactly describe how the character feels and what's she feels and why she feels that way.In the end I feel would work fine as a TV series (with hopefully a more progressive messaging at its core) but failed as a book."

It is written more as a theater play than anything else, with the right setup and characters. Everything is explained and the whole story takes place in the coffee shop. The blurb is very accurate, so I won’t get into details. However, nothing in it to keep my interest. The characters are like puppets, their dialogues disjointed, the actions artificial. The time travel part is more of a disguise here, I wouldn’t classify it in this sub-genre; it’s more of a magical realism story about regrets and things not said or done until too late and the possibility to change that; well, sort of.Not my cup of coffee at all.>>> ARC received thanks to

Summary
  This is a beautifully written novel happening inside a retro cafe where time travel is possible. It has four different stories interwoven together with characters who have their individual existence yet perfectly complement each other.


 What I learned from this book 

1) The effect of Alzheimer’s disease in marital and family life
 In Alzheimer’s disease, the subtle and sporadic deterioration of patients brain function will be a very arduous phase in their partners, and their family members life, and it is one of the rare situations in Medical Science where the spouse and family members suffer more than the patient (The author depicted it perfectly through the characters Fusagi and Kohtake.)

  
 2) Hope for a better future is the secret behind our current happy existence
 When Kei said she wanted to go to the future to see whether she would have her child due to all the pregnancy-related complications she was having at that time, her husband Nagare argued strongly against her decision as he thought that if she went into the future and discovered that the child didn’t exist, the hope which is the inner strength that had been sustaining his wife until then would be destroyed. The author shows us that hope is one of the most important things in our life via these two characters.


3) How we should behave if someone close to us passes away
The author beautifully told us how to face the death of our loved ones in this book by convincing us to stay happy and always keep on smiling so that the person who died can see us happy from the dark box (The author compares death to a dark box in this novel) to make him/her also happy.
My favourite three lines from this book or related to this book
 “At the end of the day, whether one returns to the past or travels to the future, the present doesn't change.” “Negativity is food for malady, one might say.”  “Coffee on a sail boat tastes like sunrise ” 
Verdict 
 4/5This is a book written in simple language that makes you fall in love with it from the first page itself due to its veracity and edifies us to relish the beauty of our life through love and hope."

There are some strict rules but the character driven stories were interesting. I'm not too sure what to rate this book so it might change but... 3.5?The only story I didn't care about was the last one. I absolutely hate the trope of ""woman keeps pregnancy knowing it will kill her because she wants a baby"". Nope nope nope."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36819318-scott,Rating 1 out of 5,"This book reminds me of an old Italian car, perhaps an Alfa Romeo, or a 1970s Ferrari.On the surface it looks great, but when you start it up... oh dear. At best the poor thing limps along well under the speed limit, an ominous cacophony of clunking sounds and grinding noises issuing from under the hood.I was expecting much more as this is a book that has a lot of fans.I can see why - the central concept is a nice one, and the stories are cute, in a way that is quite charmingly Japanese. In an old cafe, unchanged for decades, you can order a cup of coffee that will take you into the past. There is a catch, however. You can't leave the cafe while you are time travelling, and you can only stay in the past for as long as it takes for your coffee to go cold.Nice concept yeah? I think so too. But beyond this surface charm, well, things aren’t so slick.Mechanically, from a storytelling and writing point of view,  Before the Coffee Gets Cold needs a complete overhaul.It could be the translation, but this is a very clunky book. I managed fifty-odd pages before the repetition of previously revealed information, forced dialogue and ham-fisted exposition caused the narrative engine to seize up on me. I tried to coax myself along, taking a break from the novel for a day, before coming back and easing it into gear again, but within a few pages I was back where I had been when I first gave up - bemusedly standing next to a smoking clunker of a book, wondering how so many people could love it.Apparently, this book was written as a play first, which could explain why so much of it feels so over-explained and bluntly delivered. Much of what I found annoying could fill a role as stage directions in a performance piece, but it really jars in a novel. The fact that there time travellers must abide by a number of rules gets mentioned maybe ten times in the first section of the book, and the rules themselves get repeated so often that they become mantra-like.This could work in a performance where the audience doesn’t have the script in front of them, but in a novel it feels as though the author is assuming their readers are morons who can’t recall the events of a few sentences prior.Of course, I didn't actually finish this book - the narrative motor was never going to get me to the end - so perhaps things improve in the later stories. I doubt it though, and there was no way I was going to make it past page fifty.  Before the Coffee Gets Cold gets a lot of love here on Goodreads (so I kind of feel like I’m publicly kicking someone’s puppy) but it really wasn’t what I hoped for. In all honesty by the time the pot of tea I made when I sat down with this book had gone cold I had already decided to abandon it and start reading something else.1.5 repetitious rules (did I mention there are rules? There are rules. Important rules. Shall we go over them again? THEY ARE IMPORTANT, DON’T FORGET THEM etc. etc.) out of five."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102159719-reading-tamishly,Rating 2 out of 5,"The writing and the characters are really annoying.Because it is the umpteenth time I picked it up and yet, it's time to accept the fact that this book is just not for me. I just couldn't be patient with what the story was coming to with all that repetitive lines and the writing in the first half. The characters seem rather dull. I did try to finish up the book but I started having a headache because I was doing something I didn't want to and had to close the book and delete it after taking the picture.Yes, I love Japanese books. I love weird stories. I like emotional, sad stories. This one is all these things but it just didn't work for me. I really wanted to like this one but it's fine. Just like what happened with A Man Called Ove (my heart's still broken!), this one has a similar history in my reading life. I wish it was a short story instead. A short book which seemed too long amd repetitive for me (like how it happened with Autumn by Ali Smith). Sad story indeed."

18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote,Rating 1 out of 5,"Who wouldn’t want to time travel? Well, you probably wouldn’t if you had to follow these very precise, arbitrary and convoluted rules - yes, even more so than the usual! So the characters in this story can time travel but only to the relatively recent past and they have to sit in a specific seat at a specific table - which they can’t leave once they time travel, which means they can’t leave the cafe - and only for the duration it takes for a coffee to cool, after which you have to drink it down or else risk turning into a ghost forever burdened to haunt the cafe. Also nothing you do in the past can alter the present/future. Yay, so much whimsical fun… I loathed Toshikazu Kawaguchi’s novel Before the Coffee Gets Cold. It is amongst the sappiest drivel I’ve ever had the displeasure to read. It’s basically four short stories that happen to share the same setting and plot device. A businesswoman wants a second chance to tell her boyfriend that she loves him; a wife wants to talk to her husband about a letter he wrote pre-Alzheimer’s; a woman wants to see her kid sister again before a car accident takes her life; and, in a shocking turn of events, a woman wants to meet her unborn child in the future, which is apparently possible because why not, this is all contrived garbage anyway. It is so, so sickeningly sentimental, it’s almost unbearable. Every storyline is designed to hit you in the “feels” except Kawaguchi’s prose is so weak and inept, and his characters so shallow and unemotional, that each fails one after the other. Look, I have a heart ok - it’s in a jar in a wardrobe somewhere - but even if I was wearing it I’d still find the storylines about as moving as a rock with half the emotion. The characters - Kei, Kazu, Nagare - all seemed like the same person and were basically interchangeable because their personalities were that indistinct and irrelevant. The Alzheimer’s storyline felt especially pointless - the wife wants to talk to her husband about the letter he wrote, that was handed to her in the present, that she refused to read, but she wants him to tell her about it in the past? Just read it in the present! And the future storyline - what, she just “knows” that she’s going to die in childbirth? Gimme a break. Unless you want to read the equivalent of a novel-length Hallmark greeting card, spare yourself the tedium and don’t bother with Before the Coffee Gets Cold. If you want emotion, slam your finger in a door - you’ll feel more and it’s quicker than reading this rubbish. "
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6431467-s-penkevich,Rating 3 out of 5,"‘I was so absorbed in the things that I couldn’t change, I forgot the most important thing.’If you could return to the past, but knew you couldn’t change anything, what would you go for? Before The Coffee Gets Cold, the debut novel by Japanese playwright Toshikazu Kawaguchi and translated into English by Geoffrey Trousselot, is a warm and quirky time-travel story all confined into the singular space of a small Tokyo coffee shop. Originally a play, which may have been a better medium as the book occasionally feels like a film novelisation with pacing issues, the story stands on the strength of it’s small cast of characters as they support and empathize with one another and, in turn, win over our empathy. The time travel is complete with its own mythology and a ghost, none of which make all that much sense but it works in order to examine the emotional obstacles that exist between people (if quirky and heartwarming time travel is your thing, though, just watch About Time because it's amazing). It is a unique take on the genre that seems certain of itself as a heartwarming tear-jerker and is successful at being moving although some of the stories are a bit eyebrow-raising (the final story is a theme I dislike). A bit rough around the edges, Before the Coffee Gets Cold is a rather cute and moving idea with plenty of emotional scenes that will certainly charm many despite the execution not quite living up to the premise. ' The truth just wants to come flowing out. This is especially the case when you are trying to hide your sadness or vulnerability.'The hook for this book is certainly the time travel aspect, the mechanics of which falls apart under careful scrutiny, sure, but this isn’t hard scifi and ultimately it serves as an engaging and charming plot vessel to look at interpersonal relationships. There is a strict set of rules that grow with each stories which makes for some absurd fun as the characters are often bewildered by how restrictive they are to the point of almost rendering the time traveling useless. The biggest one being that ‘at the end of the day, whether one returns to the past or travels to the future, the present doesn't change.’ Add on to this that you can only be back in time until your coffee gets cold or face horrible consequences, and the spacial limitations for traveling seem like a marketing trick to force someone to be a regular at the shop in order for the time traveling to even conceivably be useful. All of these limitations make sense for a stage production with only one set, and, ultimately, that medium feels better fit for this story. At times it feels like over-direction as well, as if this book is giving notes for what is probably an inevitable film adaptation, with awkward overemphasis on the outfits and colors each character wears. Having it as a novel does give more insight into the characters and provide backstory and context, but so much was already done well with the dialogue it feels almost unnecessary. It might have been more effective had it not made the pacing so jumpy, with flashbacks constantly interrupting the scenes and drawing the tension out in a way that feels like the elimination round scenes in a reality show where you just want to get to the point.What transpires is frequently moving, with much of the emotional weight pinned on long held secrets or insecurities finally being revealed. The second story is particularly effective and deals with alzheimers, though at this point it seems the novel puts a lot of emphasis on women sacrificing themselves and being expected to give endless emotional labor as a heroic act. Which, particularly in the final section becomes rather annoying the final story involves sacrificing one’s health for a pregnancy and like, maybe men should cool off the “women dying in childbirth for emotional effect” trope because it’s not awesome, though another story involves a woman giving up her life and business to return to a family business she dislikes. It just feels a bit not great, but he does mine these scenarios for some particularly tearful scenes.Before the Coffee Goes Cold has a lot of mechanical and thematic issues that didn’t work for me, but overall it succeeds as being a cozy and emotionally taxing read. I suspect a lot of people will be really moved by it and I’m sure will find it very heartwarming. Reading this does make me want to see the play and I quite enjoyed all the time travel aspects, particularly the ghost element that was playful and really worked to add texture to the story. A fun read, though not one I’m particularly fond of, but effectively shows the message that ‘it takes courage to say what has to be said.’2.5/5"

21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7202176-tim,Rating 3 out of 5,"I went into this one with some hesitation as when I looked at my friends reviews, a grand total of two of them seemed to like it and everyone else didn't (some disliked it quite a bit). Still, I received it as a Christmas gift and who am I to pass on a free Japanese novel?After I got to the half way point, I had to agree with a few things I saw many reviewers commenting on; the book is repetitive and that it’s overly sentimental, both of which are negatives for me. Now when I say overly sentimental, I mean the book will pull out any trick to get an emotional reaction from you, short of a child cancer patient caring for a sick kitten. The book is designed to try to get you to cry. My wife is a big fan of Japanese and Korean dramas and this feels like the novel equivalent. Comedy and melodrama mixed, wanting you to either laugh, cry or simply hope things will work out because we want our melancholy to be mixed with joy. As for repetitive, the book, while a novel, is in many ways really just four short stories that are essentially variations of the same set up and (to a degree at least) the same conclusion. When looking up the author I discovered that he was a play writer, which does not surprise me in the slightest. The book really is a play in novel format down to the entire book taking place in the same room (one of the time travel rules is that you can't leave your seat).Now, those two complaints aside... honestly, I kind of liked it. This is by no means a great novel, but I found the time travel rules fairly amusing (and frustrating, but it kind of delighted me in that regard as well). Also, I liked the character of Kazu. As a former barista I delighted in her character. A customer comes in and pisses off a ghost and gets herself cursed? Well, offer the ghost some coffee. The ghost is just an annoyance and the customer should have been focusing on the coffee and leaving the ghost alone anyway (This really is how 90% of baristas who work the night crew would act, I assure you. You did something stupid, we would note it for future stories and possibly even post a snarky sign telling customers not to do the stupid thing again).Maybe it's not great, maybe it's more sentimental than a Spielberg movie aiming for an Oscar, but overall, I personally found a lot to like. Maybe it just caught me in the right mood... but I'll give it 3/5 stars"

I was at Schuler’s bookstore for the first time and thought Before The Coffee Gets Cold would be a great little book to read while I was spending all day in the coffee shop attached to the bookstore.Before The Coffee Gets Cold is divided into four sections, but at its heart is the idea that in a certain coffee shop, if you sit in a particular chair, you can go back in time and have a short conversation with someone else who has visited the coffee shop for as long as your coffee stays warm. The first story, The Lovers, was disappointing. I had to put the book down and pick it back up. There were a bunch of characters that didn’t seem to move the story forward, and it took forever to get to the time travel part. Then, the time travel part was very short. The second story, Husband and Wife, was much more promising, and it did end up making me cry. It was incredibly moving, and I will remember it for a long time into the future.The third and fourth stories, The Sisters and Mother and Child, were disappointing as well.

Split into four parts, Before the Coffee Gets Cold is a wonderful, quick read that will transport readers to a mysterious cafe where its patrons are able to time-travel but must return before the coffee gets cold. There, we follow along with four different stories of characters wanting to reconcile past arguments, find closure, or assure loved ones through the use of time-travel. While this book is slow-moving and heavily reliant on dialogue rather than descriptions (something that I really, really enjoy but others may not like), I absolutely fell in love with the story and the little lessons woven into each narrative. It was bittersweet, endearing, and touching to see people from all walks of life try to reconnect with loved ones where they learn that they might not be able to completely fix the past, but they can learn from it and be touched by it. For months upon months, I've eyed this book, wanting to dive into its story, and, now, I'm so glad that I did. It felt like a warm hug given to be by a sweet yet heartbreaking read."

You can't leave the said chair.4. You can only meet the people who have been to the cafe at the specific time to which you traveled.5. Last and most important. Drink the coffee before it gets cold or you'll be the ghost to occupy the chair. 🙂~ (Internal monologue: With rules like this I can clearly see why no one time travels. But I love my beloved too much to let it slip.) OKAY🥴🛫TIME TRAVEL.. TIME TRAVEL.. *fade, turn into steam*in the pastXYZ, love of my life..

Too conservative. Why does one have to wait three years to marry someone, when that person didn't even try to fight for the relation. Why is a stunningly beautiful, feminine, loving, caring, intelligent, successful woman waiting for her ex who left without even communicating where they stand?Why can life be fulfilled only by running the family inn you hated for 15 years, after your siblings death. Seems more like guilt than actually finding happiness to me.Why is a gynecologist's clinic a woman's domain, to be untouched by a man? Is it too unmanly to hold your DYING wife's hands when she's carrying your child? My guy refuses to even go the gynec's appointment with his wife!Also, why was there not ONE man- NOT A SINGLE MAN who time traveled to fix things or made a sacrifice? It's all the women fixing blunders caused by others, feeling guilty, even dying for others. A woman waits for three years for her non-communicating boyfriend/ex. It's a free spirited woman tethering herself to a family inn she loathed. It's a woman sacrificing her life in pregnancy YET feeling guilty. Like- wtf woman?! You died so that child can live and you still feel guilty!Maybe the author is actually a feminist- believer in equal rights for all but it most definitely didn't read like one.Let's just say the cup of coffee was too cold for me and end it here for the more I write about it, the angrier I get.

The lighting was provided by just six shaded lamps hanging from the ceiling and a single wall lamp near the entrance. A permanent sepia hue stained the café interior. Without a clock, there was no way to tell whether it was night or day. There were three large antique wall clocks in the café. The arms of each, however, showed different times. Was this intentional? Or were they just broken? Customers on their first visit never understood why the clocks were like this.”Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi features four interwoven stories set in the retro Funiculi Funicula Café in Japan – a café that is not only popular for its aromatic brew but one that is the subject of an urban legend as the “ café that transports you back in time”. Time travel, as facilitated by the cafe, is possible but under strict rules and limitations at the center of which (contrary to popular belief influenced by movies and novels) is : “There is nothing you can do while in the past that will change the present.”One would wonder why then, would someone go back in the past if it would have no visible impact on the present. If your regrets, missed opportunities and mistakes are not undone and your life does not change for the better why would you go to the trouble of embarking on such a journey? As we meet the owners, staff and patrons of this magical café, a few of whom facilitate the journey for others and some who partake in the venture for different reasons -a young professional who believes she has chosen her career over the man she loves, a wife dealing with her husband's Alzheimer’s diagnosis, a woman who is racked by guilt for the way she treated her late sister and an expectant mother who is willing to sacrifice her life to bring her baby into this world- we share their experiences of time-travel and the impact that the same has on them and their lives Ultimately this is a story about love, relationships, sacrifice and the lengths one would go to for the people they care about. With its atmospheric setting and imagery, simple prose and elements of magical realism, Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi is an engaging and thought-provoking read. Though the occasional dispassionate tone and the repetitiveness in the text did bother me slightly, overall I did enjoy the read and look forward to reading the next installment in this series.  “At the end of the day, whether one returns to the past or travels to the future, the present does not change. So it raises the question: just what is the point of that chair?But Kazu still goes on believing that, no matter what difficulties people face, they will always have the strength to overcome them. It just takes heart. And if the chair can change someone’s heart, it clearly has its purpose.”"

29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily,Rating 2 out of 5,"I spotted this when I was browsing in a bookshop. I love time travel paradoxes, the premise and setting of this sounded intriguing, and I was charmed by the cover (shards of aqua foil, plus a cat that isn't in the book). How shallow I am. This is my penance.What would you do?Who wouldn’t want to travel in time, if there was no danger? The main problem would be choosing when and where to go. The rules in this scenario are so limiting, choice is easy. Plus, there’s a sort of reverse butterfly effect: whatever you see or say, won’t change the present. That sounds safe - but also pointless: more like watching a film reel than actually travelling.It’s set in a 140-year old Japanese basement café in the present day. No windows, so “A permanent sepia hue stained the café interior”. It has three counter seats, and three two-people tables, three clocks, and three staff.Each of the four sections focus on a particular situation that prompts a woman to to see loved-ones they cannot otherwise see, or get answers to important questions. There's a backdrop of recurring characters and a continuous, chronological narrative.The willing suspension of disbeliefIt’s especially important to suppress incredulity in time travel stories, which often don’t (and can’t) explain the mechanics. The key word is “willing”. There was too much I disliked for me to suspend the large amounts of disbelief required. I read the whole book, even though I didn’t enjoy it, in the vain hope I’d be won over. The saving grace is that it’s quite short. Image: John Tenniel’s illustration of the White Rabbit, worrying about being late. The rules•	You must return “before the coffee gets cold”, otherwise  you become the next café ghost .•	You must sit in a specific seat and not move from it.•	That seat is occupied most of the time  by the café ghost, so you have to wait for her daily trip to the loo .•	You must not challenge the person sitting in the time travel seat  or she will curse you .•	You can only meet someone who has been to the café.•	You can only use the time travel seat once.•	You can travel to the past or the future, but the rules make the future more problematic, so few people do it.The title rule had promise, but the others made it less interesting. I felt as if some had been added later to make the story work - but they failed.I now wonder if it would work better without the time travel element! Just tell the four poignant stories of semi-connected women (ideally in a more positive way), where they find peace from information via more conventional means, such as a cache of old letters or a long-lost relative. The flaws in the rulesNot plot spoilers, but I want to remember what I disliked, without highlighting those features to people who enjoyed the book. I don’t think it's possible to tell a time travel story without any contradictions or unanswered questions, but this has far too many, imo.•	How cold is “cold”, and who decides? •	Why does no one maximise their time by avoiding milk and keeping the cup as full as possible for as long as possible?•	There is no attempt to give even a magical explanation for how a customer gets to the time and date they pick.•	The penalty for being late is severe, but time travellers don’t have much control over when they return. •	Time travel won’t change the present - unless you become a ghost. That’s a pretty big “change”!•	The staff acknowledge that although you can’t change the present, “the future hasn’t happened yet”, so it’s not much of a rule.•	The ghost’s curses are unpleasant but ineffectual, so rather pointless.•	When someone is late and becomes the new ghost, does the old ghost die properly?•	What happens when a customer recognises the ghost, but doesn’t realise they are a ghost?•	In the story, the café has been written about, albeit as a possible urban legend. Are there any missing person reports about people who became ghosts?The flaws in the bookNot plot spoilers, but I want to remember what I disliked, without highlighting those features to people who enjoyed the book.•	There’s a lot of male gaze. Women are always described by their clothes, skin, hair, and curves. It’s the quantity, more than specific examples: “A revealing yellow tube top”, and a highschooler whose “naturally long eyelashes accentuated her pretty features”. •	Several of the situations involve women sacrificing almost everything for others. That’s tricky from a male author, but perhaps that goes down better in Japan.•	The characters were not very distinct. I rather lost track of who was who, even though I took notes and read it in two sittings, on consecutive days. Having so many names beginning with K didn’t help: Kazu, Kumi, Kohtake, Kei. •	Lazy exposition comes by citing a magazine article about the café, and yet there's a lot of repetition.•	Page 1 says Fumiko had been Goro’s girlfriend for three years, but page 46 says they first met only two years ago, and no, it’s nothing to do with time travel. Just sloppy.Other things are just odd. Had I enjoyed the book, I might have thought them charming quirks.•	The café is more than 140 years old, and is called Funiculì Funicula, after the 1880 song to commemorate the first funicular railway on Mount Vesuvius. Why?•	A woman who runs a café opposite - directly opposite - comes in for a coffee every day before work.•	Different staff make coffee in totally different ways, but the price is the same, whether made by pressing a single button on a machine or hand-dripping it slowly. •	There are three antique clocks, all showing different times, which confuses everyone. Later, we learn the middle one tells the correct time, which wouldn’t be difficult to ascertain. "

31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41862451-nilguen,Rating 3 out of 5,"A combination of sci-fi, fantasy and magical realism, this novel takes place at a café in Tokio. It revolves around transporting its characters back in time to have them reflect on themselves and change their perspectives onto a better future by finding closure with their pasts. The novel comprises four short stories, hence the rules of time travelling are explained over and over again in each chapter. Therefore, I can follow my book friends‘ criticism that the writing appears repetitive. In this context, some parts of the book felt a tad redundant to me. Furthermore, the characters and their interactions felt mechanical to me, however, this could be a very subjective perception due to cultural differences. I couldn’t connect with the characters, which is the missing element to me to feel emotionally engaged in a novel. Promising premise, which makes it the more tangible that this plot is being adapted to the screen 🍿. Difficult to rate, since the idea is brilliant, but I feel it’s execution was ‘average’; after much contemplation compared to other books in my reading experience I went for 3 stars .Thanks to NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for my honest review. 🙏Find me on instagram"

I highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys stories about love, loss, and second chances. If you are looking for a book that will tug at your heartstrings and leave you feeling emotionally fulfilled, ""Before the Coffee Gets Cold"" is the perfect novel for you.♥️+ I'll definitely read the second book soon....some Quotes:“I was so absorbed in the things that I couldn’t change, I forgot the most important thing”“With the coffee in front of her, she closed her eyes, and inhaled deeply. It was her moment of happiness”“. . . as the future hasn't happened yet, I guess that's up to you. . .”“We must become friends before this coffee cools”“If you could go back, who would you want to meet?”“At the end of the day, whether one returns to the past or travels to the future, the present does not change.”“You know how much your father loved you.

I only read the first line in the synopsis and then I randomly got it. Time travel is such a fascinating subject to me. In this book it was done in such a unique, heartwarming, and a really touching way. It’s a book that made me both happy and sad. It put such a sad smile on my face. A Cafe that gives you an opportunity to time-travel, if given the chance who would you like to meet? With a set of rules that make all of that seem “pointless”, like how you must come back before your coffee gets cold and no matter what you do, you can’t change the present. Is it still worth it?I don’t think I’ve ever read anything like that book before. The book was so interesting and heartwarming to read. The last two stories made me so freakin emotional. My only complain is that it kind of lacked depth, I wanted more. Such a lovely easy to read beautiful book that would make you both feel and think."

I don't understand the hype around this one. Maybe it gets interesting later on but why spend so long talking about nothing? And repeating the same rules over and over?

40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,No Rating,"This was a DNF for me so I’m not giving it a rating. To be fair, I should say that it was a downloaded audio book, unusual for me. I listened to it several times for almost two hours of its 6+ hours length and I just couldn’t get into it. On audio I had trouble distinguishing among the various Japanese names so at times I wasn’t certain who the narrative referred to and it’s a lot more difficult to ‘go back’ on an audio book to check a name to figure it out.It’s a science fiction book about going back in time. There are many ‘rules’ about how you do this and in those two hours of listening I heard the rules repeated about a half-dozen times so I thought that was annoying and unnecessary. The rules included things such as: you had to sit in a certain chair in a certain coffee shop; you could only go back in time for as long as it took for your coffee to get cold; you had to wait for a certain woman who always sat in that chair to take a bathroom break, and when you were back in time, nothing you could do would affect what had happened in the present. The first part focused on a young woman whose male friend suddenly broke up with her to take a job in the USA. (The novel is set in Japan.) She had been hoping for marriage. She wants to go back in time to talk with her ex to see if something she had said would have changed his mind – even though it wouldn’t have brought him back, since by the rules, she can’t change what happened. The author (b. 1971) has been a playwright and this is his first book. Photo of a Japanese coffee shop from ana-cooljapan.comThe author from literaryaffairs.net"

42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57137850-niki,Rating 1 out of 5,"Finally done with this dry as fuck stage direction booklet (this isn't a novel and you can't convince me otherwise) Dry as fuck, awkward (none of the characters feel like people at any given time), but also too cutesy (there's anime bullshit like ""the cute young girl puffed her cheeks in frustration""), and too repetitive (the time travelling rules are repeated ad nauseam throughout, and every single ""traveller"" has the exact same thoughts before, during, and after) Every single story is sickly sappy and tries so hard to make you tear up (the despite-the-odds romance! The couple that will end up like ""The Notebook""! The ""black lamb coming home"" family story! The ""mother sacrifices her own life to give birth to a child she'll never meet"" bullshit!) that it ends up being the exact opposite.Not to mention the ridiculous, vaguely sexist plots. The incredibly successful woman who speaks 6 languages breaks down because, apparently, her entire life revolves around her boyfriend who's moving away (like they can't do a long distance relationship??? He's not going to die??) The independent bar owner who has to be punished for living away from her family and is made by the plot to move back home and ""learn to love"" the family business? The sickly-but-always-cheerful mother who sacrifices her own life for the good of her unborn child (that she didn't need to have??? Someone explain to me why it's soooo heartwarming for a child to grow up without a mother, and the mother KNOWING this and deciding to go through with it anyway) It's fucking terrible.I get why people seem to like this but it did absolutely nothing for me. I had to push myself to finish it when I was already at 90% and I ended up skimming that last 10%. Good riddance."

44,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90347401-elsa-rajan-pradhananga,Rating 4 out of 5,"I fell in love with the blurb of this book. Before the coffee gets cold is a collection of 4 interconnected stories set in a cafe that offers its customers the unique experience of traveling in time. My mind was preoccupied with thoughts on the many possibilities as I placed my order for this book. But I won’t say I was elated when done with it because the rules the time travelers had to follow came in the way of my high spirits. #1. The only people you can meet are those who’ve visited the cafe#2. There’s nothing you can do in the past that’ll change the present#3. It is only possible to time travel when seated at a particular seat in the cafe#4. While in the past, you must stay on the seat and never move from it#5. You must return to the present before your coffee gets coldThe absurdity in not being able to change the past, present or future makes the time travel pointless but those that went ahead and met a loved one in another time, did so out of sheer regret and anxiety. My favorite of the stories was of a couple that frequented the cafe – Fusagi who suffered from early onset Alzheimer’s and his wife Kohtake. He wrote a letter asking Kohtake not care for him like a nurse if he ever forgot who she was and carried it with him every day knowing well that his wife would visit him from the future to be able to talk to him at a time when he still remembered her. An absolute tear jerker. I loved the ghost who always sat reading on the much sought after seat and didn’t think twice about terrifying or cursing customers who attempted to move her from her spot. When alive, she had visited the past but couldn't make it back before her coffee got cold and was thus suspended between the time frames. Nevertheless she stuck to her set of rules and was outwitted in one of the stories. Overall, Before the coffee gets cold is a unique take on time travel with heartfelt stories that stress on the value we place on relationships and remind us to express our love and concern for our dear ones while we still can."

Yeah yeah, throw your tomatoes at me, whatever. I don’t care. At least I have the 1st amendment. I can exercise free speech. I am fucking crazy, but I am free. I saw this book ALLLL over BookTube and Bookstagram and basically every other Book[social media platform]s that exist. The concept is undeniably intriguing: you can time travel to the past to see someone again, as long as you finish your coffee before it gets cold. Sounds dope. Unfortunately, I think the execution falls flat in many more ways than one. Perhaps I would have enjoyed this more if it weren’t for the relentless praise I had seen for it earlier. First, there are an insane number of rules that define your time traveling experience, some of which were established at the very beginning, while others were introduced only when it was convenient. To those of you who haven’t picked this up yet, I’ll give you an example of one that’s established in the beginning: you must sit in the designated “time travel” café seat. But more and more kept popping up all willy-nilly... like... what was the point or throwing them in haphazardly? I am a woman of structure. Give me my structure or give me death! From a reader’s perspective, it felt like a lazy way of making your story make sense without putting in the work. Secondly, I was interested by only some of the characters while others felt flat. I think this may just have to deal with the short length of the novel as a whole. It ends up feeling a bit empty for a book that should have had me sobbing. An attempt was made though... I definitely see what the author was getting at, but I didn’t ever feel moved to tears. Not crying is rare for me ! Not a fan of the writing style either, which sometimes felt a bit disjointed in the way that I had to go back a paragraph and reread what just happened because the events didn’t quite happen in chronological order. Maybe I’m just a stickler. Maybe I’m just particular. Whatever. Guys I’m tired of being a hater too. But look at those 3 shiny stars, folks! I DID enjoy it! I am a gracious god.

Are you curious?When you arrive at the cafe, you are told of specific rules to follow:  - You can only visit someone who has previously been at the cafe. - You must sit at a specific table and in a specific chair. - You must return before your serving of coffee is cold.These four woman visit the cafe to make their journey through time: - A woman who chose her career over her long-time boyfriend. - A woman whose husband is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. - A woman whose estranged sister dies in a tragic accident. - A woman who is carrying her unborn child. Will each woman make it back before the coffee gets cold?This is one of the two books selected for April '22 for the community book club I belong to and one I would not have chosen to read on my own. As I begin to write my review, I discover there is more I didn't like about this story than I thought I did when I finished the audiobook.  These four stories speak of passion and depth of backstories, but the writing style seems detached, as if the writer is looking at a distance toward the cafe, removed from the emotions felt by the occupants. With names that sound similar and indistinguishable, connecting with the characters is difficult and confusing. Which name and character belongs to each story? The audiobook is narrated by Arina Li whose narration is stilted and voicing is muddled. This short listen has so much detail I re-listened to sections several times to ensure I didn't miss any key points and as an additional effort to get the right name and character connected to the correct story. This is an incredibly thought provoking read with strong themes about relationships, personal accountability, and long-term perspectives. It is a story that I liked for its premise and possibilities, but I didn't love it and never felt fully engaged with either the writing or the characters. "

50,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42055091-dilushani-jayalath,Rating 5 out of 5,"I finished this book during one of the hardest times I’ve passed this year. If I am being honest, it was the hardest in the past few years itself. I’ve lost a part of me that is special to me. Someone as close my family. And while I stayed up with him during his hardest time, I read this. And I finished with the last story after he left this earth. Thus this book will hold a special place in my heart. If I admit I started reading books of the magical realism genre recently and thanks should be given to the amazing author Haruki Murakami for it. Before that I had never read a single book of that genre and quite frankly had not even understood the concept clearly. Even now I cannot come to tell that I understand. It’s one that barges throwing the thin line between reality and fantasy. But bringing those two close together, it gives a certain unique outlook on our everyday life. This book gives the reader a look into a beautiful cafe that allows their patrons to either go back in time or to the future. But with the small fact that their actions would not change the course set in the future. For the first time in my life, I wished I could do the same. I wished I would be able to go back, take a glimpse. Even for a short period. Being affected by books is normal for me but this book hit me right in the core. I felt pushed away from y center of gravity. I wanted to crawl into the cafe and take a sip of the coffee. I’ve never wanted to as much as I did the moment I finished the book. I rather not go say that much about it. My review for this is being fueled by my emotions right now and maybe this review will go down the wrong path. In the end it was a beautiful story that will stay in my heart forever. "

I definitely enjoyed some of the character development, and the stories of each persons reason for time travelling (some definitely pulled at my heart strings more than others)… but it was quite a slog to want to finish the book.

60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50043037-talkincloud,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow!Co gdybyś mógł cofnąć się w czasie, ale tylko do momentu, aż twoja kawa nie ostygnie? Sięgnąłem po tę książkę ze względu na tytuł – nie będę ukrywał.  Uwielbiam kawę, a kiedy zobaczyłem, że to książka o kawiarni, w której można cofnąć się w czasie, byłem kupiony. Zazwyczaj nie czytam powieści japońskich/chińskich/koreańskich autorów (chyba czas to zmienić). Czytałem kilka, ale nigdy nie byłem nimi specjalnie oczarowany (może nie trafiłem do tej pory na te właściwe?) Tutaj jest inaczej. Książka Kawaguchiego jest w stu procentach książką dla mnie: mamy kawę, kawiarnię, emocje i łączące się ze sobą historie zwykłych ludzi. Uwielbiam. Nic na to nie poradzę. To dla mnie zaskoczenie. Coś innego. Coś świeżego, powieść, która sprawiła, że inaczej spojrzałem na współczesna literaturę – pokazała mi, że jest jeszcze tyle obszarów do odkrycia! Słuchałem Before the Coffee Gets Cold w formie audiobooka, a potem przeczytałem tekst i moje odczucia co do wyjątkowości tej książki się nie zmieniły. Lubię, kiedy za pomocą tak niewielu słów autor przekazuje tak wiele wartościowych treści. Wykreowane napięcie i uczucia bohaterów są niesamowicie zaprezentowane. Historia małżeństwa i matki, pragnącej poznać swoja córkę ujęły mnie na tyle, że złapałem się na łkaniu, kiedy wsadzałem ubrania do pralki! (ze słuchawkami na uszach, tak). Jest warta uwagi – fenomenalna książka. Bohaterów w tej książce jest wielu i trzeba traktować ich raczej zbiorczo, ale każdy wydaje się być niesamowicie realnym. Nie potrafię wybrać ulubionego – każdy miał do zaoferowania coś innego, niesamowitego. To postacie, które możemy spotkać w prawdziwej kawiarni. Jednostki charakterystyczne, ale jednocześnie nieco chowające się w tłumie. Trzeba tylko z każdego wydobyć historię, którą skrywa. Motywacje były rzetelnie opisane, emocje wiarygodne, a ja nie mam zarzutów nawet do postaci pobocznych (chociażby ducha grającego w tej powieści dość ważną, mimo że skromna rolę). Każda z historii zainteresowała mnie na tyle, że nie starałem się wysnuwać przypuszczeń co do ich zakończenia, chociaż pojawiały się w moich myślach i raczej nie były błędne. Chciałem być zaskoczony. Można przewidzieć co się wydarzy, nie mówię, że to niemożliwe, bo historie bohaterów wyjęte są z prawdziwego życia, ale wysnuwanie podejrzeń mogę uznać za raczej za zaletę tej powieści. Chodzi tutaj o wzbudzenie emocji, nie o plot-twisty.Dzięki temu, że wydarzenia opisywane są właściwie w jednym miejscu, nietrudno się zanurzyć w lekturze, wyobrazić sobie postacie i kawiarnię przyjmującą nowych klientów. Odgłosy, zapachy i wszystko co z wiązane z kawiarnią zostało sprawnie zaprezentowane w tej historii. Książka podzielona jest na 4 rozdziały: łączą się one ze sobą – w każdym rozdziale występują bohaterowie, którzy pracują w kawiarni. Konstrukcja bardzo mi się podobała, bo rzeczy wspomniane w jednym rozdziale miały rozwinięcie w kolejnym. Autor sprawnie przemyślał całą fabułę. Język jest prosty, przystępny, nie ma tutaj zbyt wielu ozdobników, przez co w opowieść szybko się wsiąka i przez nią płynie. Występuje tu sporo dialogów, ale stanowią one jedną z ważniejszych części powieści. Rozmowa jest tutaj kluczowa dla rozwoju akcji. Ta historia jest świeża, ciekawa i na pewno zadowoli wielu czytelników, zwłaszcza tych zmęczonych czytaniem opowieści typowo amerykańskich. Polecam!"

SUMMARY:
Is about a cafe named Funiculi Funicula that can bring you to the past, and before the coffee gets cold, you have to go back to the present time.This book has only 4 chapters, and each chapter represents one short story.👁️

This story is told in third person POV


AUDIOBOOK REVIEW🔊:
Narrated by: Arina Li 👩Length of audio: 6h 52mThe narrator did a pretty good job; I have no problem with her voice, and I think the way she pronounced the Japanese name was great. At first, I thought she spoke a little bit too fast, until I realized that I set my speed at 1.25x (so silly). However, listening to this audiobook for 6 hours 52 minutes was excruciatingly boring for me. I couldn't help but keep wondering, ""Why should you go back to the past even when you cannot change anything?"" I had this one question lingering in my mind even until the end of the book.
MY THOUGHTS:
📌 First let's we talk about the five rules:✏️The first rule – the only people one may meet while back in the past are those who have visited the cafe. ✏️The second rule – no matter how hard one tries while back in the past, one cannot change the present. ✏️The third rule – in order to return to the past, you have to sit in that seat and that seat alone. This was the seat occupied by the woman in the dress. If you try to sit there by force, you get cursed.✏️The fourth rule – while back in the past, you must stay in the seat and never move from it. ✏️The fifth rule – there is a time limitJust by those rules, ""Do you want to go back to the past?"" The answer is: of course ""NO,"" except...""You are desperate enough to bet your own life to travel back in time, and if you violate one rule, you will end up as a ghost that should go to the toilet and take care of that curse seat.""No, thank you so much, I'll pass.📌 I couldn't remember even a single character's name in this book, I think I always have this problem, whenever I read a book written by Japanese author. 
WHY IT DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR ME:
☠️ Despite this is a short book with only 213 pages, but it was very b.o.r.i.n.g. I remember it taking awhile just to explain those rules, and I also didn't feel those stories were heartwarming or sad. For me, it was very bland.☠️ I knew this was a fantasy genre, but you know when a fantasy book goes ""to infinity and beyond"", and ends up becoming ridiculous instead? Yeah, this is how I felt toward this book.....☠️ This book is not my cup of tea; I picked it up based on the hype and popularity.☠️ My first impression of this book was ""it's going to be good"", but as soon as I started it, that impression fell apart. As you know, this book is very popular, and most of my friends have read it, so I might as well try it too.
OVERALL:
If I could travel back in time, I would tell myself, ""Don't go even near this book."" Or maybe I should try to go to Funiculi Funicula Cafe and get a cup of coffee? But if I followed those rules, then It means I still ended up reading this book! So tell me, what use is it to go back to the past if I cannot change anything?

If you are a fan of that genre, I absolutely recommend you read this series. Each chapter is like an episode, or a short story, and are loosely connected. There are rules for time travel in this café. Just when you think you know all the rules, there’s another! This makes the book quirky and fun. It reminds me a lot of Dr. Who-each story is extremely well written, delves into the human condition, and strikes an emotional chord. Reconciliation and healing hearts is at the core of each story. Before the Coffee Gets Cold is a quick and moving read. Like a good cup of coffee, I was left wanting more. Thankfully, there are two more books in the series."

Tal vez tuvo un inicio poco favorable, pero con el paso de las páginas encontré una cafetería que me hizo sentir en casa y personajes bastante entrañables.

64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36725393-alison,Rating 3 out of 5,"I have to admit to being a little disappointed in this and not only because of the lack of a cat despite one being shown on the cover. Having recently developed a love of Japanese fiction I was very excited to come across this on Netgalley, particularly when I read the blurb and discovered it was a story involving time travel (I love stories with time travel). Perhaps my expectations were too high as while I loved the concept behind it I didn't really connect to it and it became an OK read rather than something special.The story is set in a small cafe where if you sit in a specific seat and follow a set ritual you can travel in time. There are a number of rules but the most important is that you must return before your coffee gets cold. You can't change your present by going to the past but you can go back and see someone you've lost, to tell them how you feel, to resolve conflicts and get closure. It's a wonderful idea and there are some truly touching moments but these were too few and I think down to me being a soft touch rather than the story.It's so difficult to tell with translated fiction how much of the problems come from the translation and how much from the original but I did feel like the writing let it down. I am starting to think this is just typical of the Japanese style of writing, short, quick sentences, little in the way of description or emotion, but I felt this was particularly lacking.I can't say any of the characters were particularly likeable and they often come across as blunt, rude and unfeeling. They make fun of Fumiko for wanting to go back to the time her relationship ended as if she's silly for being upset the man she hoped to marry chose work over her.There are times when it seems in fact that the author views all women as silly, nasty or manipulative. It could be a cultural thing or it may be something has gotten lost in translation but I found a few things annoying. Kei not having a phone because her husband does, Hasai thinking women need to wield tears like a weapon.Added to this it's a little repetitive in places and some of the rules around time travel seemed a little inconsistent or forced to fit the story. I also thought the ending left a little too much unresolved.It is however an intriguing read and does make you ponder a few things. At around 200 pages it's also quite a quick read so it's not too difficult to make it to the end.Overall, an interesting and different read that was just missing the emotion needed to elevate it. If you're a fan of Japanese fiction you'll likely enjoy it. Thanks to netgalley and the publishers for providing me with an ARC. All views are my own."

A gdyby tak zajrzeć do środka, usiąść przy jednym z wiekowych stolików i napić się starannie parzonej kawy? Legenda głosi, że do kawy możesz otrzymać coś jeszcze – niepowtarzalną możliwość podróży w czasie. Ale są pewne zasady. Najważniejsza to ta, żeby wrócić zanim wystygnie kawa, którą masz przed sobą.„Zanim wystygnie kawa” to zbiór czterech historii, dla których punktem wspólnym jest owa, tajemnicza kawiarnia oferująca klientom podróże w czasie. Choć powody są różne, to zasady zawsze te same – nie można zmienić biegu wydarzeń i wpłynąć na teraźniejszość. Ale można spotkać się z kimś po raz ostatni, wypowiedzieć słowa, na które kiedyś zabrakło odwagi albo… no właśnie – a po co ty wrócił_byś do przeszłości?To delikatnie snuta opowieść, wokół której roztacza się aura niepewności i tajemnicy. Nie jest skomplikowana, wręcz przeciwnie. Bardzo japońska w swojej prostocie, więc na pewno trafi do miłośników „Ukochanego równania profesora”. Ma w sobie podobny klimat, jakby lekko zasnutej za mgłą opowieści. Sprawdzi się też na jesienne wieczory, wypełnione melancholią i tęsknotą za uciekającym latem.Uważam, że pomysł na fabułę jest naprawdę rewelacyjny. Ja jednak wolę nieco bardziej dosadne książki, które wciągają mnie głęboko do środka, zamiast delikatnie unosić na powierzchni."

This is a special café because the customers have a chance to travel back in time. What... sign me up NOW!? Unfortunately, it’s not that simple and there are some strict rules that need to be followed.
Rules
	You can only travel back to the café. The person you are choosing to meet also must have already been or will one day be at that café. 	There is only one seat available in the café that allows you to time travel. This seat will be available only once a day and its when the ghost woman who occupies that seat goes to the bathroom.	When you time travel to the past you will not be able to change the present. The only purpose of going back to the past is to get a better understanding of what you feel you have unresolved. I really enjoyed this short book and the four short stories of the individuals who wanted to travel back in time. 1st Story- So cute2nd Story- Nearly broke my heart in pieces.3rd Story- Ugh so sad4th Story- Ok pass the flipping tissues!The writing is simplistic and easy to follow. Its clear to see that the book is supposed to provide a meaning for the readers, and I understood it. There’s something about Japanese literature that will really tug on your emotions and mind. My only negatives are that for such a short book it was at times a bit too repetitive and the actions of some of the characters didn't match up with the personalities so I was confused a bit. Would love to see a movie or TV series adaptation on this book! 3.5 ⭐"

68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsOn a side street in Tokyo there's a little coffee shop called Funiculi Funicula that has a very unusual feature. It allows people to travel back in time. There are rigid rules for time travelers, however, as follows:- Whatever you do, you CANNOT change the present.- You can only interact with people who have visited Funiculi Funicula. - You must sit in one specific chair in the café to time travel, and you can't leave the chair for any reason. The catch is, a ghost - in the form of a woman reading a book - occupies the chair and only leaves once a day to go to the toilet.- A cup of coffee starts the journey, and you MUST return to the present before the coffee gets cold. As the book unfolds, four women take advantage of the time traveling feature - each one for her own reasons.*****♥ Fumiko and her long-time boyfriend Goro arrange to meet at Funiculi Funicula because Goro wants to have a serious conversation. Fumiko thinks Goro is going to propose, and purchases a special outfit for the occasion. Instead, Goro says he's taking a job in New York and has to leave immediately. Fumiko refuses to hear Goro's explanation and tells him to just go. Thus Goro is off to America. A few days later Fumiko regrets being so abrupt and - though she knows she can't change the present - goes back in time to tell Goro she doesn't want him to go.*****♥ Kohtake and her husband Fusagi are a long-married couple who regularly patronize Funiculi Funicula. A few years ago Fusagi got early onset Alzheimer's and he now doesn't recognize his wife. However, Kohtake is a trained nurse, and she takes care of Fusagi in that capacity. When Kohtake learns that Fusagi wrote her a letter right after he fell ill, but didn't give it to her, she goes back in time to get the missive.*****♥ Hirai was expected to take over her parents' inn, but being a free spirit, left home. Hirai moved to Tokyo and bought a food bar near Funiculi Funicula. Now Hirai is estranged from her parents..........and her younger sister Kumi reluctantly manages the inn. Kumi frequently comes to Tokyo to see Hirai, but Hirai avoids her sister at all costs. In fact Hirai once crouched behind the counter of Funiculi Funicula for three hours to dodge Kumi. Sadly, Kumi died in a traffic accident after her latest attempt to see Hirai, and Hirai goes back in time to speak to her sister.*****♥ Kei, a waitress at Funiculi Funicula, is married to the café's owner Nagare. Kei has always had a weak constitution and was never able to engage in vigorous activity. Now Kei is pregnant, and the doctor says it's unlikely both she and the baby can survive. Nevertheless, Kei chooses to continue with the pregnancy.Thinking about time travel at the café, Kei decides to try to travel to the FUTURE, in an attempt to meet her child. *****In the course of the book, these protagonists - as well as several secondary characters - are fleshed out, and we learn about various aspects of their lives. We also see how time travel affects the characters. Time travel is an interesting theme, though staying only as long as it takes for a cup of coffee to cool, and being unable to change the present, is rather limiting. This latter rule seemed fudged a bit, though. The author explains that, should you go back in time and shoot someone (who's now alive), there will happen to be phenomenal surgeon on hand, a supply of blood, etc. In my view, someone who required emergency surgery would be different in the present, but I'll let it go. I like the book, which is engaging and quirky, and will go on to the sequel, Before the Coffee Gets Cold: Tales from the CaféThe book is translated from the Japanese by Geoffrey Trousselot, and the prose is a little stilted and choppy. However I don't know if this is due to the translation or the original narrative.There's a film adaptation of this book, called Café Funiculi Funicula.

72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35362731-tamar-playing-hooky-for-a-few-hours-today,Rating 4 out of 5,"Five stars might be more accurate. This is an interesting book about an underground café that has only about four tables and only about two people working the café. I'm not even sure what period the book spans and I couldn't repeat any of the characters' names - not that I think the names are essential, as long as you can follow what's going on/get the point.So, this café is famous for enabling people to go back in time (and as it transpires also forward in time). There are plenty of rules: you must have visited the café in the past with the person you want to hook up with; you can only sit in one particular chair; you may not get out of your chair while the event is occurring, you must finish drinking the cup of coffee you are served before it gets cold (or you will become a ghost), nothing you can say or do will alter the course of events - the thing you want most to prevent will always occur no matter what.Now, that particular chair is permanently occupied by the ghost of a woman in a dress reading a book. The only way to get into that chair is if she gets up to go to the bathroom, so the best way to get that to happen is to keep her coffee cup filled. Apparently, the ghost does not know how to stop drinking the coffee and eventually she gets up and walks over to the bathroom, at which point you dash into the seat before she gets back.Although you cannot change what happens, you can learn what led up to the thing that happened and, as we learn in the first story, just because you cannot change what happened does not mean that what the future holds is not exactly what you wanted to happen – or what you learn to be happy or satisfied with, when it does happen. On the other hand, even if you are going back to see someone who has died, or meet up again with your husband before he is lost to alzheimer, you still might come to inner peace in unexpected ways. The meeting does allow you to read a letter that never arrived or was delivered, change the course of a prior conversation to better understand a person’s thoughts or motives, find a way to bridge a chasm, meet a child that you did not live to raise, come back to see a mother who never knew you, take a photo, return to the bosom of your family and assume the role you were so keen on avoiding…my eyes are filling with tears as I write this. The book might be tedious in parts for some, it is not a page flipping thriller, but it had its poignant moments and my heart filled and my eyes flooded during parts of the later stories. Sounds confusing? It totally can be, and if you are listening and trying to sort out who is who, it is almost impossible to do so, unless you have a very good ear and uncanny ability to discern the difference between the different Japanese names. I don't seem to have a problem floating in an out of Never-Never-Land, so I just went with the flow. Although the recording was very good, it is possible that some might prefer the clarity of the printed word. This book is in libraries everywhere. I borrowed from Hoopla, it returned before I finished and I was going to let it slide, but then I couldn’t, and back I went to download again and finish. I’m glad I did."

74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell,Rating 3 out of 5,"I have mixed feelings about this book. The story follows various characters at a Japanese cafe where customers are able to travel back in time. However, they can only do so by sitting in one particular seat from which they cannot get up when they time travel, and they can only travel back to the cafe to meet people who have been to the cafe before. And they must finish drinking a cup of coffee before it gets cold or else they will be stuck as a ghost in the cafe. It's a unique premise and the book has a cozy atmosphere. The premise sounds intense but the book is rather quiet and pensive. I really enjoyed the mood of the story and the way we learn about characters over the course of the novel.The story is broken into 4 sections. Each section tells the story of a different customer and their time travel experience. The first 2 stories didn't do much for me, but the last 2 were very moving and emotional. I came to enjoy the novel more as it went along. The last 2 stories also begin to tie in threads from the previous 2 stories. At first I thought all 4 stories would be standalones, but as the novel goes on you can see how they all entwine, which I really appreciated.My biggest issue with this is how repetitive it is. In the first story alone the rules of the cafe are repeated about three times. And then it's reiterated from time to time in the other stories. It's not a particularly long story and the rules aren't that complicated, so it was not necessary to reshare them over and over again. I also felt that the first 2 stories lacked some of the depth that the latter 2 had. Some characters get way more description and backstory than others which obviously helped me care about them more. I would continue with this series though! Like I said, it's a simple, cozy read that is perfect to read snuggled up on the couch with a cup of coffee :)"

76,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28365883-elizabeth-plant-based-bride,Rating 3 out of 5,"I have so many complicated feelings about this book. The writing style was jarring, to say the least. Disjointed, dispassionate, and incredibly repetitive, we are regaled with unending lists of foods ordered as listed on a receipt and told the exact payment and change for each purchase. Each characters’ clothing is described in great detail while we hear little to nothing of their actual appearance or manner. Characters repeating the same line of dialogue back to each other (or just to themselves) several times before moving on with a scene. I almost DNFd several times in the first half as I struggled to connect to the story in any way. Could this be due to the translation or my lack of experience with Japanese literature? Perhaps. But nonetheless it was difficult to enjoy the first 50% or so of this book. However, the second half turned everything around for me. Emotional, poignant, and tragic - the humanity and vulnerability I was missing delivered in spades. I found myself quite touched by the final two stories. And so, I come around again to my complicated and contrasting feelings about this book. Would I recommend it? Yes, for a particular type of reader. Did I fall in love with it? No, sadly I did not.

The novel is set in a small, traditional café in Tokyo named Funiculi Funicula.The café is known for serving a special blend of coffee that allows those who sit in a particular seat to journey into the past or future, but with a set of strict rules. One major rule is that the time-traveling customer must return to the present before the coffee gets cold. The narrative unfolds as different characters visit the café, each with a unique reason to revisit a moment in their lives.The characters include Fumiko, grappling with the loss of a loved one; Kotake, who feels she has lost both her husband and herself in the process of grieving; Hirai, harboring secrets from her sister; and Kei, a mother striving to find the strength within to be the best parent she can be. Each character carries a sense of regret, and as they sip their coffee, painful memories resurface. Yet, they all come to realize that the past is unchangeable, and what truly matters is the present – the opportunity to make the right choices and savor every moment, much like sipping coffee, one sip at a time."

Slowly I got the characters all accounted for and then my reading enjoyment kicked in.I know it’s a bad thing but I’ve been comparing all books by Japanese authors to Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata which I thoroughly enjoyed. The comparison between the latter and Before the Coffee Gets Cold was really minimal. The only real comparison was that both books were very enjoyable in their own right.I liked Toshikazu Kawaguchi approach in combining three stories in one book but I see that many Goodread members didn’t like that about the book. Some parts were really sad, especially the second “part” where one character is in the mist of Alzheimer’s (too close to home for me because my mother had the disease) but the author weaved a beautiful story nonetheless.Definitely an enjoyable read, one for all to enjoy. 🤗 "

It's pretty short and easy to read, but after I finished I went back and read one part again, because I missed the significance the first time through. (You'll know what I mean if you read it). The tale becomes much more nuanced and meaningful once everything comes full circle.There's a LOT of repetition, especially of the rules, and for such a short book this got quite tedious. Maybe it doesn't seem so repetitive in the original language? I started off listening to this as an audio book and I'm really glad I did, because it made the Japanese names easier for me to pronounce in my head, and it made me grasp the flow of the language better. I liked the individuals who traveled through time and what they learned about themselves in the process. It was very touching when they realized that, while they couldn't change the present circumstances, they could change themselves, the way they reacted, and how the future was going to progress from that point.Overall, I'm glad I read this book and took the time to think about it in relation to my own life.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.

Every once in awhile I need to take a breather from all the stabby and culty stuff that is truly my heart’s desire. I also need to give my old eyeholes a break from the Kindle until my new glasses arrive so I usually stop by the library every Wednesday on my way home and grab a few paper selections for the weekend. And then I return half of the them because the font is too small and they end up causing me eye strain as well . . . . 

This slim novel ended up being just the right fit. Both in font size, page count and feeeeeeeelz. The rules at the Fuiculi Funicula, a small basement coffee shop in Tokyo are simple – if you sit in a certain seat you can travel back in time. But take note that your visit can only last until your cup of coffee grows cold and you are not able to change the future. It is here that two lovers, a husband and wife, sisters, and a mother and daughter will each have brief encounters.The ratings are kind of all over the place, but any book that makes my Grinch heart grow three sizes and I’m able to read over my own cup(s) of Sunday morning coffee is a winner for me.

101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4501926-richard,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’m sorry but, here is a book that made me cry. I have always enjoyed the fantasy of time travel and the temporal anomalies associated with it.In these four stories, linked throughout by familiar characters, we learn author Toshikazu Kawaguchi’s gentle thoughts on the subject. This isn’t so much science fiction as interpretation of the human heart.He has created a basement café where time seems to have little influence. Three clocks adorn the wall and only one appears to show the correct time. No windows betray the time of day or season and the place seems to have an ambient temperature yet no air conditioning is working.Urban legend holds that within this humble place patrons can travel back in time; rules seem to make the trip meaningless as it cannot impact the present or change history. The opportunity is rare. To engage in this activity you need to be seated in one particular place. That table unfortunately seems constantly occupied by a woman reading a book.Since the author is a skilled playwright the atmosphere, sense of place and dialogue are first class. The stories are drawn from difficult circumstances, where misfortune and sadness abounds. They are over arched with the nuisance of a hard life and a sense of missed chances. Furthermore it probes our own thoughts, and the gauntlet is almost thrown down to ask how we would act if we could make up for an oversight or failed response to show we care or loved someone?This isn’t voyeurism, the time travel is selective in that you can only meet someone who has frequented the café themselves. It is a brief encounter to redress some personal loss, hurt or grief, that while it will not change things in the here and now will perhaps address the what ifs and the if only.A clever insightful and gentle perception of human weakness, unconscious thought and drive for meaningful relationships. Being a Japanese writer we are blessed by the skill of the translator’s work and privileged to see another culture where heart and mind resonate with our own and our human condition is revealed as a universal one.My tears may have dried but my praise for this book knows no bounds. I am delighted to have had access to it and heartened to learn another book is coming."

Non mi attirava, credevo non facesse per me. (Spoiler: avevo ragione.) Poi un amico me l'ha prestato senza darmi spiegazioni e a quel punto non ho potuto sottrarmi.Ho iniziato la lettura pensando che sarebbe stato una brutta copia di Being Erica (che per la cronaca è una splendida serie TV canadese, forse un po' marcatamente femminile ma molto interessante) ma ho cambiato idea a pagina 36: no, manco per sogno, non sono nemmeno in competizione, stanno proprio giocando in campionati diversi.In Being Erica ci sono i viaggi nel passato, sì, ma Erica Strange ha spessore, è una persona a tutto tondo, esprime le proprie emozioni con una vastissima gamma di gesti, sguardi, vocaboli, cresce, impara, cade di nuovo. Qui in pochissime righe capiamo quale sia il tormento del personaggio di turno, lo/la vediamo struggersi un istante chiedendosi se sia il caso di farlo davvero oppure no, quindi si viaggia nel tempo e poi di nuovo nel presente. Tutto fatto, grazie, quanto vi devo per il caffè, addio.Ma che davvero?Però.Vogliamo provare ad ipotizzare che non sia tutta responsabilità di Kawaguchi? Intanto leggo che il testo parrebbe essere stato concepito come una pièce teatrale. E allora sì che alcune cose avrebbero più senso.Ma soprattutto, l'edizione di Garzanti è tradotta dall'inglese. Il testo originale però è in giapponese. Anche con tutta la buona volontà, anche partendo dal presupposto che sia stato tradotto con la massima professionalità possibile e dai traduttori più talentuosi al mondo, vogliamo ammettere che è come ascoltare una notizia di seconda o terza mano? Garzanti, ma che stai a fa'?Infine, ma forse è la questione principale, la distanza culturale. Il tutto ha questo forte aroma giapponese, spesso cerimonioso e affettato, per me incomprensibile, ma magari - per una persona un minimo più esperta di cultura del Giappone - vero."

Don’t expect the present to change no matter what you change in the past.2. There’s only one seat that allows you to time travel and you must sit in it the entire time that you’re “visiting.”3. You only have the time that it takes for your coffee to turn cold. If you’re not back by then, you get stuck at the cafe as a ghost. 4. You can only go once.But, what good is going back if you can’t change the outcome? Is it enough just to see the person you’re missing or will it be too much to bear? In this novel we first follow two lovers, followed by a married couple, two sisters & finally a mother and child. They’re all hoping to see their loved one again whether they’ve moved or passed away.

Step your foot forward into a small but delightful cafe, enclosed in the secluded confines of Tokyo. A cafe emitting enveloping warmth, exuberant hospitality, and finely brewed coffee. Unlike any other, this particular cafe offers a sentimentally transcending experience, presenting the fragile ability to revert back to something that everyone has pent up emotions for, the past. But nothing is perfect and nothing allows you to have it all, therefore strict rules and warnings will be conveyed in this backwards time travel expedition. One, this isn’t a do over in life, therefore the present and future will not be changed. And two, return to the present before the coffee gets uncomfortably cold. With Four visiting customers that embrace themselves upon journeying into their past lives, all of them confide towards their own haunting stories from before, that hurt them even more now. Keeping the rules of traveling back to time in mind, it fleshes out the the sensitivity of all these characters who are simply longing to navigate in the past, not to change anything, but to have a sense of closure. To relish moments that were taken for granted. Overall, the delicacy was my favorite aspect here, because it illustrates just how suffering and weak being human can be at times. But no this isn’t supposed to sound sad and the reason why lies in the overall message that this novel paints, to enjoy your present, make lasting memories with your loved ones and keep crafting your future. Let the past, just be the past. A resonating novel that has an adequate length. Perfect for feeling those wholesome cozy vibes. Perfect for anyone trying to flex up the book count, or anyone going through them slumps that stay slumping. Would I recommend this, yes. But most importantly, I’d recommend with a cup of coffee ☕️. Be extra like me when reading this."
109,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91622714-rosh,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book has a very interesting premise where coffee comes not just in the title but plays an important role in the story. It talks of a unique cafe in Japan, where drinking a special coffee from a particular seat in the cafe allows you to travel in time. The book goes into the time travel aspect without going all technical about it. Whatever comes across as a loophole in typical sci-fi time travel books is explained away with a rule. The book is a decent read, while not being outstanding. The stories are really appealing but the writing style should have been crisper. The author meanders along the side lanes of the story while you are desperately waiting to get onto the expressway. The biggest confusion for me was with the names of the characters. There are so many names beginning with the letter 'K'--Kazu, Kei, Kumi, Kohtake,-- that I felt like I had stepped into an Ekta Kapoor show! This book has a sequel too but I don't feel like picking it up for now. Maybe in future. 🤷🏻‍♀️My rating: 3.25*************************************Join me on the Facebook group,

Even though this is my best friends favourite book of all time, it just wasn’t my lukewarm cup of coffee at all. I can keep the “lukewarm part” spoiler free, but in order to discuss what really ground my beans and had me ready for a dark-roast, I’m going to have to spoil some of the books events. Be aware: spoilers under the Ugly-section. Also: I will knock it off with the coffee-puns, don’t worry. The GoodI really liked the take on time-travel this book had. In short, we follow the everyday happenings in a seemingly ordinary coffee-shop in a small back alley in Tokyo. Except when you sit at a specific table, under specific circumstances, this place offers you an opportunity to travel back in time, and revisit or repeat a conversation with a loved one you’d wish you’d handled differently. During your time-travel, you’re confined to your chair and can only stay for the duration that your coffee is still steaming, leaving you with a limited time to say your piece. Before the Coffee Gets Cold  chronicles 4 stories, of 4 separate visitors, each on their personal quest for closure.Time travel can be such a complex maze of paradoxes and by setting these strict rules the author avoids many of these issues. In fact, I often thought of it more as “conversations with ghosts of the past”, rather than time travel. It makes for a great set-up, and one that I’m sure many of us have fantasized about before.The Bad: Things fall apart from the get-go, mostly because of the incredibly clunky writing. I first thought this was a poor translation, but I’ve since heard Japanese reviewers saying it’s actually very true to the original style. Kawaguchi originally wrote this story to be a (screen)play, only to later adapt it into novel form. Except little “adapting” was actually done. There’s so much narrative exposition, dry and lifeless dialogue and a complete lack of transitions or cohesion between the four stories. Characterisation was horrendous, with each character having a single character-trait/motivation, or none at all. As a result, the dialogues that form the centre of this book read like an exercise of “dry-reading a stage play” with the character-sheet missing. The book overall is of course deeply sentimental and is guilty of the bookish-sin I hate most: being emotionally manipulative and written with the sole intent to make the reader cry. If you’re going to tuck my heartstring this blatantly, at least have the decency to wrap your attempts up in an acceptable plot. All of the above made for a 2-star book, but what truly catapulted this one into 1-star territory was some of the underlying messaging that I really couldn’t get behind. There will be spoilers from this point on, so be warned. The Ugly:This novel perpetuates and romanticises some incredibly traditionalist views in my opinion, especially in regards to the roles a woman should take within a relationship. These themes are present in all four stories, but I’ll highlight the most egregious examples. In our first story, a woman relives a pivotal conversation with her (ex)boyfriend. Her take-away from this experience is the realisation that she would’ve been happier had she places her “less accomplished career” (she’s a medical tech and he’s a game developer, so I’m not sure why she’s hellbent on comparing the two) secondary to his happiness. Wife-is-for-the-house, man-for-the-money-trope. Already icky, but I can look past it this once. In the second story, a woman has a conversation with her husband suffering from Alzheimers, in a time before he lost his memories of her. She comes away with the realisation that she’s utterly content having given up her entire life and career to become his full-time caretaker, because “it’s her natural place as a wife and she loves him so much”. NO, NO, NO, NO! Can we please not romanticise and oversimplify the incredibly complex dynamic of a care-taking relationship in this way?! Worst offender is the final story, in which a girl travels back in time to speak to her mother who died giving birth to her(?! Makes no sense but don’t question it) to ask her some burning questions. We learn that mum knew from the get-go that she was ill and would likely die in childbirth, yet selfishly and stubbornly continued to ignore health-risks, become pregnant and continue with the pregnancy, in order to fulfil her purpose to become a mum. The novel then praises her as a selfless hero for it. In my personal opinion: setting a child into the world to grow up an orphan, because you know for a fact you will not be there to take care of it is incredibly selfish. You’re only thinking of your own wishes of being a mum, without considering the implications for the child (growing up without a parent, the survivors-guilt this kid will face etc.). This trope also perpetuates the idea that a woman’s sole purpose and value in life is in producing off-spring, which I deeply reject. Overall, this book started bad but left a scolding burn of anger the longer I sat with it. I know for a fact there’s an audience out there for this book (again Robin, I’m so sorry), but I personally cannot recommend it to anyone."

“It takes courage to say what has to be said.”

 This is the kind of books that I always have a cold feet going into. It just kept popping everywhere lately that I had to finally give it a chance. There are a few reasons as to why I stay away from similar books: translations can be tricky and I will never get to appreciate the author’s real style. Magic realism is a genre that I don’t like.This is a story about time travel and I read some of those stories before and they all sound similar at some point. This one however and to be fair is a bit different from the technical point of view because you can choose to travel to the past or future from a seat in a coffee shop but there are very strict rules and the fanciest one is that you have to come back before the coffee gets cold which is where the story gets its name from.The thing about these stories is that they always have the same core message which is to live the present to the fullest and appreciate what we have specially when it comes to people and never wait to do something because we don’t know what the future is hiding and through this story we get to meet 4 characters who decide to time travel for different reasons which I mostly mentioned above. However, the execution was a bit weak because the points of the stories were a bit buried in sentiment.The story is short with a fast pacing so I read the whole thing in less than 3 hours. The characters never get to shine because our time (pun intended) with them is short. There is a focus on appearance and some telling rather than showing.Summary: It is a cute and fast story that is kind of forgettable on the long run. I liked the queer time travel rules and I will remember those despite me always hating not getting explanations for magic in this genre. The characters are okay and the writing could have been better although I am not sure how much of it was lost in translation. It is a fast read anyway so if you like time travel stories, give it a chance."
119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137099804-madii,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5/5 <3‘before the coffee gets cold’ is a collection of four short stories set in a cafe where you can go back in time, each one following a different character as they travel into the past to have one last conversation with a loved one. this is the first piece of translated fiction i’ve ever read and honestly i was blown away but it’s tender, touching nature. each story unique and beautiful in its own way and the author presents many topics, conveyed and discussed in a new light, from a new perspective in a subtle manner i really enjoyed. i often find that when books in-cooperate an aspect of magical realism they do not use it to its full potential, however this was not the case here. such a variety of people and situations were described in the novel, each carefully thought out. i also loved how the short stories intertwined… it gave me chills.moving onto the cons, i found the main fault in the novel for me was its repetitive nature… for instance, the rules of the coffee shop were explained so many times and it got a little tedious. it was also just a little dull being set in the same coffee shop the entire time.. there wasn’t a whole lot going on to keep me invested in the story. nevertheless, overall i definitely recommend this book. it’s cosy and warm and comforting but also sad and thought provoking. it’s an incredibly moving story."

The use of time travel is unique in its rules, providing something different (and might I say refreshing?) compared to your typical time travel story.But ultimately, the novel stumbles with its translation of a story from Japanese to English.

129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 stars. I think if I hadn't recently read The Midnight Library, this would have got a higher rating. They share similar themes of regret and redemption but while Matt Haig's book managed to move me to tears, this just left me feeling a little lacking in anything. The Funiculi Funicula cafe gives its patrons the ability to travel back in time. However, there are rules. You must sit in one particular seat and not move from it (normally occupied by a rather grumpy ghost), nothing that you do in the past will change the present, you can only visit someone who has been in the cafe, and you must drink the coffee before it gets cold. There are no exceptions. The idea is wonderfully intriguing. What would you do given the chance to go back and revisit an old friend, lover or relative for a few minutes? Would you take the risk, knowing that nothing you say or do will change the future?The stories vary from a woman wanting to speak to her sister and stone for her recent behaviour to a woman looking to see her husband before his dementia took his memories away. All of the stories are poignant and different, and the inclusion of the cafe staff members keeps the stories grounded within the cafe while providing a common plot point throughout. However there was just something missing for me in most of the stories - especially at the beginning. Being so short, I don't think there was really any time to develop these characters and make me connect with them emotionally. Events happen at lightening speeds, told about over one paragraph, before we move on to something else and someone else's story. I also found some of the language a bit stilted - but this may be entirely down to the translation. Being such a closed room story, which takes place entirely within the space of one environment, also made the story feel very closed in. There's no room to breath between stories, no world to explore - and while on some level I liked this, I don't think we are given a broad enough overview of what the cafe looks like, and the atmosphere it permeates, to really be drawn into this environment.Intriguing idea, with some interesting moral and social viewpoints explored, but this just missed the spot for me emotionally.

130,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15962370-sarah,Rating 3 out of 5,"""If you could go back [or forward], who would you want to meet?""This beguiling little book explores the personal opportunities of time travel, amongst a small group of workers and customers at a backstreet Tokyo café. Told in four parts, it focuses on love as it exists within different types of human relationships: lovers facing separation due to career opportunities; a married couple dealing with the husband's worsening dementia; estranged sisters trying to balance their own dreams with family expectations; and a woman in the early stages of pregnancy imagining her future child.Funiculi Funicula is a small windowless basement café in a quiet sidestreet, patronised by a small but loyal group of Tokyo locals. Along with carefully-brewed coffee, the café offers an unusual service - the opportunity, subject to certain strict rules, to travel backwards or forwards in time. Only one chair in the café allows time travel, and the traveller must remain in that seat for the duration of their journey. The time travel is initiated by the pouring of a coffee into a special cup, and travellers must return to the present by drinking that coffee before it goes cold.""At the end of the day, whether one returns to the past or travels to the future, the present does not change. So it raises the question: just what is the point of that chair?""My impressions of the book varied over the course of reading it. Of the four parts, I found the first the least engaging and the central character rather vapid, but I was glad I persevered, as there was some real insight and pathos in the later parts. I haven't read a lot of Japanese fiction in translation, and perhaps it is as a result of cultural differences, or of the book's origins as a play script, but I felt that the prose and plotting lacked nuance in parts. I was also left feeling bemused that the role and importance of the ""ghost"" woman dressed in white, who acts as a sort of gatekeeper to the special chair, was never explained. My presumption was that she was a former traveller who had failed to return by the time her coffee cooled, and was thus trapped in a sort of in-between, but this was never made clear.Overall, a really interesting premise, with some delightful and poignant moments of insight into the complexities of human relationships, but perhaps falling a little short of my expectations."

134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95484843-eva,Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5 stars - moving, but also incredibly socially conservative (in terms of being pretty anti-feminist (1st wave, not advanced stuff). It felt like a pretty calculated tearjerker (as if the author is quietly cutting onions next to you), meant to convey extremely sentimental, simplistic messages. It contained several unnecessary repetitions of the same information, the prose seemed clunky, the dialogue halting and stilted, the exposition is ham-fisted, and there are perspective problems. People's clothing is described in great detail without any reason to do so. The 4 stories which make up this collection did touch my heart, but I honestly cannot understand why this wallowing in melodrama is regarded as a great literary fiction novel by some websites. Well, at least I now know which critics to disregard!What frustrated me among other things was how unable everyone seemed to be to talk about their feelings even though the narration does just that the whole time (""but it was impossible to put any of this into words"" - dude, you just did for several paragraphs, along with why she feels that way and what she thought that made her feel that way). And so male-gazey! ""She was smart and beautiful, but she didn't know it""... ""even in her conservative clothing, her exceptional figure was easy to discern. Like a model from a fashion magazine, she was a beautiful woman who would draw anyone’s gaze.""Oh, I've just found out that this was written as a play (and a movie) in Japanese, which was later novelized and translated into English: now it all makes sense!! The novelization was a terrible idea from an artistic perspective (and badly executed): all the descriptions, explanations and stage directions would have made perfect sense in a play, including the detailed descriptions of the characters' emotions which they then fail to communicate verbally - meant as instructions for actors, not as clumsy explanations for the audience, thus dumbing everything down. If it wasn't for the hyper-conservative messaging, I'd be curious to see the actual play instead of reading this weird hybrid, I'm sure it would be pretty good when performed. So, if you don't mind sentiment and some weird messaging (e.g. ""as a woman, give up your job/career to please your family even when they're already dead"", or ""if your early stage pregnancy is 100% certain to kill you, carry to term and die"") then it's better to go see the play (or the movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFUOx...), instead of reading the book (IMHO). If there was any nuanced examination of these themes, I wouldn't have had an issue, instead I felt emotionally manipulated. But: it was still an interesting read, the central premise with the time travel cafe is wonderful, and many of the descriptions are cute and charming. It's mostly what was done with all this and the weird novelization that was disappointing for me."

Although you won’t change your past, you’ll return a different person.However, if you let your coffee turn cold before your returning, you’ll be doomed to live the rest of your life as a specter ...Gosh, this book makes so much sense:Like a phantom, past is permanently haunting us with all sorts of recriminations due to our stupid mistakes.

If you could change anything, what would you change? Whatever you do, you can never change the present. How many times did you ask yourself the same questions? How many of you out there would love to travel back in time or the future, if you could? Raise your hand ✋, don't be shy, nobody else is looking! Ok for those of you who raised your hand, I know the perfect place you could go 😉! It's a cafe in Tokyo.It's the middle of Summer and you're really hot looking for a place to cool down. As you walk around, you notice this particular cafe. As you enter, you hear, "" Clang - dong"" "" Hello! Welcome!"" Oh, that's Kazu, the head waitress greeting you! There's a ceiling fan to cool you down, only it feels like air conditioning. You'll notice a few oddities inside. The walls are all a sepia color, not a very welcoming color. There's no windows and three clocks 🕜🕒🕑all different times. There's a woman in a white dress drinking coffee and reading a novel who is always there. She is sitting in ' the seat.'  As Kazu takes your order you are asked where you want to travel to. See, there's an urban legend that time travel is possible in this cafe. So being in the cafe must certainly mean you want to travel through time. She goes over the rules, oh so very very many rules that you must follow in order to go through time. These rules must be followed or you face dire circumstances! The first one is that there's only one seat that you must sit in to time travel.. it's the one that is occupied by the woman who is in the white dress reading a novel and drinking coffee. Well, one problem is getting her to move. Not too easily done!! Even if you agree with all the rules, knowing that you can't change the present, do you still want to go? What would you like to risk to make it possible to meet the person you wanted to meet or change whatever it is you wanted to change? If you still want to go, hurray for you!! Just remember that you must come back before your coffee gets cold!!! Enjoy your travels and good luck 🤞!!!! 📖☕🕜🕑🕒I really enjoyed this book! It's unique and truly interesting to hear the four stories in this book and how things worked out or didn't work out for these characters! I highly recommend this book, which can be read as a stand alone. I'm going to read the series of 4 books. Off to enjoy Tales From The Cafe ( book 2!) Enjoy and Happy Reading 💫✨😁"

It's a new year and I could literally feel my brain rotting, so I'm trying to jump start my reading habit and get my attention span back. At least fifty pages a day is the goal.Before the Coffee Gets Cold was a good beginning! It's four interconnected short stories that take place in the same cafe with a shared cast of characters. The quaint Japanese underground cafe has a chair that allows the patrons to travel through time—with a few conditions. While they can't change the present, gaining a new perspective on the past gives them the courage to make changes for a better future. The writing is plain and easy to read. It did get repetitive at points (the rules! the cafe descriptions! the excessive amount of ""K"" names!), but it has a lot of heart. I ugly-cried a few times, especially during the ""Husband and Wife"" and ""Mother and Child"" chapters. I look forward to reading the other books in the series in the coming months.
""The magazine piece on the urban legend had stated, “At the end of the day, whether one returns to the past or travels to the future, the present does not change. So it raises the question: just what is the point of that chair?”But Kazu still goes on believing that, no matter what difficulties people face, they will always have the strength to overcome them. It just takes heart. And if the chair can change someone’s heart, it clearly has its purpose.""

I loved the concept of a time-travel cafe and had no problem with the prose being very simplistic; however, the actual stories were a big letdown. The only story that I thought was genuinely touching was that of Kohtake and her husband.The first customer and her story were simply odd - the boyfriend's reason for leaving and how he decided to go about it were beyond silly (healthy communication who?). The Hirai sisters' story was yet another case of terrible miscommunication that lasted for years. (Spoilers from here) It wasn't believable to me that her sister never mentioned the real reason for her visits, and that Yaeko, after running away to avoid having to take over the family business, suddenly thought it was a great idea just because her sister wanted them to do it together.The worst of the four stories was the last one. Let's just say I'm not a fan of stories that glorify women choosing to die for a pregnancy (especially when written by a man). So, despite the interesting premise, I ended up disliking more than half of this book."

The chance given to travel back in time and speak their mind provides the character with more clarity and also a seed of hope, and that resonated more with me this time around.51% Husband and Wife - It's another simple story, this time about a married couple. But thematically, it has similar vibes to the first; what really spoke to me about this one is how deeply and differently people can love and allow themselves to be loved. There are choices involved, along with feelings, that's for sure. 77% The Sisters - As a person with sisters, this one hit home in that it made me grateful to have such a strong relationship with them. It’s a bit different from the others, but the theme of being able to say what you need to and also to hear what you need to remained stable the forefront. 100% Mother and Daughter - This story also tugs at the heartstrings, and, more importantly, it really highlights the fact that the brief time travel at the cafe is meant to have an impact on the person who has done the traveling.2021 THOUGHTS:I’ve been interested in this one for a while, but finally picked up a copy for myself after my sister Rachel and friend Kristin read the book earlier this year. And I really liked it! The concept was so interesting, and I genuinely appreciated the execution of these interconnected characters all tied together by one place."

You can travel back in time - IF you understand all of the rules. Some of those rules are: You have to sit in a certain chair (I don’t want to give up too much information about the details here but there is more to this rule!)You cannot visit someone who hasn’t been to the cafe before.No matter what you do or say while you’re in the past- it won’t change the present when you come back.There are many other rules but the most important one; you must drink the coffee before it gets cold.The book will offer you different character’s stories and also their reasoning for wanting to travel back in time as well as their experiences while they go back. Kawaguchi’s characters will touch your heart and you will definitely feel for them in your heart. Some probably more than others. The Husband and Wife story really got me. Definitely my favorite in this book. I don’t know what is missing for me because it’s a great idea for a book, the individual character’s stories were touching and thought provoking, but I felt like I was on the outside looking into a window seeing a play on stage more than the feeling of becoming immersed in the story. We are reading this one for book club at work and I think it’s a great choice for our group, it will spark some excellent discussion. "

Niestety mimo mojej wyrobionej już książkowej intuicji, od czasu do czasu zdarza mi się sięgnąć po tytuł, który rozmija się z moimi oczekiwaniami. I tak było z „Zanim wystygnie kawa”. Fabułę pewnie większość z was już zna, bo o książce dość głośno. Po krótce mamy kawiarnię, w której siadając na jednym z krzeseł (i spełniając kilka innych warunków, ugh) klienci mogą przenieść się w czasie.

Szkoda.Mocno irytowała mnie masa (niepotrzebnych) powtórzeń imion (Fumiko po raz piąty na tej samej stronie doprowadzało mnie do szału jak pisk styropianu na szybie) oraz ciągłe przypominanie zasad przenoszenia w czasie, w tym tej najważniejszej, tytułowej wróć „zanim wystygnie kawa”. Po drugim powtórzeniu zdążyłam już je zapamiętać na wieki. Do kolejnych minusów muszę też dopisać powierzchowne opisanie postaci, podawanie emocji jak na tacy i na koniec zdania, które miały brzmieć wzniośle i wyszukanie, ale dla mnie brzmiały po prostu sztucznie. Ostatnie kilkadziesiąt stron to było już szybkie kartkowanie, bo nie lubię tracić czasu na literaturę nie dla mnie.

Actually this would make an amazing adaptation to a theatrical play!!A beautiful book about regret, dealing with the fact that relationships with dear ones will change, for a number of reasons which can all be equally heartbreaking. It’s about how we can have emotional intelligence to face those people, and though we don’t have a coffee shop to talk to them one last time, how can we get through these painful emotions of regret, saudade, wishing things had happened differently, that you didn’t lose them.I personally found all the stories very sensitive even if the characters can be quite theatrical, I found the book lovely and book shop absolutely charming, I loved hanging out and listening to their stories…☕️"

Καλύτερα να είχε γραφτεί σαν θεατρικό. Στην πρώτη ιστορία μια γυναίκα διάνοια, πετυχημένη επαγγελματικά και αυτόνομη οικονομικά, ξεροσταλιάζει για έναν τύπο που την έχει χουεσμένη και που την παράτησε σύξυλη για να κυνηγήσει τη δουλειά των ονείρων του στις ΗΠΑ. Στη δεύτερη ιστορία μια νοσηλεύτρια γίνεται η νοσηλεύτρια του άντρα της που πάσχει από Αλτσχάιμερ. Στην τρίτη ιστορία μια γυναίκα ικανοποιημένη από τη ζωή και τις επιλογές της τα παρατάει όλα για να κάνει αυτό που θέλουν οι δικοί της παρ' όλο που αυτό δεν της φέρνει καμία χαρά. Και στην τέταρτη -και μακράν αγαπημένη μου ιστορία, που θα την λάτρευαν οι θιασωτές του κινήματος ''Αφήστε με να ζήσω''- μια γυναίκα με σοβαρότατο πρόβλημα υγείας αποφασίζει να μείνει έγκυος και να γεννήσει παρ' ότι γνωρίζει ότι θα πεθάνει στην πορεία. Το βιβλίο ρέπει από τη μια σε cozy και feelgood ανάγνωσμα και από την άλλη σε μελόδραμα με διάφορες σκηνές και γεγονότα να εκβιάζουν το συναίσθημα του αναγνώστη.Η όλη συντηρίλα του σίγουρα είναι πλήρως αντιπροσωπευτική των κοινωνικών προσδοκόμενων από το γυναικείο φύλο (γάμοι από τα 20, μωρά με κάθε κόστος, θυσία για τους πάντες και τα πάντα) στα περισσότερα μέρη του πλανήτη και φυσικά και στη χώρα μας παρ΄ότι θεωρούμαστε κομμάτι του δυτικού κόσμου.

Baltos lankos savo ištikimus skaitytojus ne per seniausiai irgi pradžiugino galimybe paskaityti šį perliuką.Jaukus naminis viršelis gal kiek keistai koreliuoja su mintimi apie kelionę laiku, bet kai įsiskaitai, supranti, kad potekstė daug gilesnė. Trumpai apie ką: kažkur Tokijuje randasi šimtametė kavinė, kur su ypatinga atida klientams ruošiama kava. Šalia puikios kavos yra ir extra galimybė keliauti laiku. Tai nėra itin paprasta, nes patį procesą lydi daug taisyklių ir apribojimų, bet tie, kuriems kelionė laiku būtina, sutinka keliauti bet kokia kaina. Knygoje sutinkame keturis keliautojus laiku. Kiekvieno kelionė savaip unikali, kartu bendražmogiška, o, svarbiausia, paliečianti iki pačių širdies gelmių.Knyga paliečia tikrai kiekvieno žmogaus galvoje bent kartą prasuktą temą - kelionė laiku. Ką darytum, jei galėtum keliauti? Į kurį laiką persikeltum? Ką pakeistum? Man skaitant šiek tiek jautėsi toks Murakami vaibas. Kažkas tarp labai tikro ir visiškai mistiško. Kažkuo priminė man ""Begalinę lygtį"" ir vėliau supratau kodėl - vertėja Gabija Enciūtė vertė abi knygas. Natūralu, kad vertėja turi savo braižą.Pirminis įspūdis nebuvo toks stiprus kaip keitėsi vis iriantis puslapiais tolyn. Užvertus paskutinį puslapį neliko nieko kito kaip pripažinti, kad tai tikrai stiprus kūrinys, kuris labai daug vietos atrakina pamąstymams. Puiki puiki puiki knyga.

The first story was curious enough, but the idea of an apparently beautiful woman (cliché in itself) who is mightily intelligent, would mope and wait around for a guy that went for some other job abroad is quite beyond me. After the first story, things became a little messy for my tastes.The second was just ""there"" and I didn't neither love nor despise it, but the third was a little daft, as it was concerning a man that regards gynaecology as a place no man should tread. Really? As I read on, things became too sentimental, and I felt like the author threw these characters in, just to try and get the reader to cry. I certainly didn't hate this book, but I've finished feeling quite disappointed. "

""At the end of the day, whether one returns to the past or travels to the future, the present doesn't change.""I was not expecting to like this book as much as I did. The concept was really good, and nothing like I had read before. ""Water flows from high places to low places. That is the nature of gravity. Emotions also seem to act according to gravity. When in the presence of someone with whom you have a bond, and to whom you have entrusted your feelings, it is hard to lie and get away with it. The truth just wants to come flowing out. This is especially the case when you are trying to hide your sadness or vulnerability. It is much easier to conceal sadness from a stranger, or from someone you don’t trust.""The stories were all individual yet all connected, and it all comes to a conclusion at the end, which I found both heartbreaking and beautiful.""I was so absorbed in the things that I couldn’t change, I forgot the most important thing.""The characters were lovely, and beautifully written, which compelled me to love all of them. The author has a way to make you get attached to them in only a few pages, and I absolutely loved that.""With the coffee in front of her, she closed her eyes, and inhaled deeply. It was her moment of happiness.""For the writing, it was both simple yet poetic and beautiful. I absolutely loved it.

There are many characters at the beginning, which was challenging to keep track of, but their parts in the story become more clear as the book goes on. In a cafe in Japan, there is a chair that allows one to go back in time or to visit the future. However, there are many strict rules to the time travel discouraging people from going. Two of the main rules are that even if you go back to the past, whatever you aim to do cannot change the present situation. You also have a limited amount of time in the past, meaning that you must drink all the coffee before it gets cold or you will be stuck in the past. The story is unlike anything I’ve read before. It had a nice flow and was easy to read. I enjoyed the variety of characters. They were endearing and had wonderful friendships. They came together and helped one another during difficult life transitions. The ending was sweet but sad. I liked the message that even if the present cannot change, one’s heart and perspective can change, making time travel purposeful. 💛"

Oh god! This book was such a wonderful surprise! A quirky and comical take on time travel with characters that take you on a journey filled with regrets, confessions, vulnerability and redemption. Funiculi Funicula is no ordinary cafe. It has a chair that transport you back in time and allows you to redo a conversation with a loved one. But there are rules to follow and you must return before your coffee gets cold. This book is so heartfelt and pure in its intent that I couldn't help but cry multiple times. It emphasizes the need to let our guards down and be vulnerable and honest with our loved ones. This book has a quiet humor yet is moving and emotional at the same time.

Alsof een boek dan, in die bepaalde periode van je leven, op je pad komt en je het gevoel hebt dat dat zo moet zijn. Maar het zou evengoed zo kunnen zijn dat je in een bepaalde roman leest, wil zien en interpreteert wat daar staat in het licht van wat er in die bepaalde periode van je leven gebeurt en van belang is.In ""Voordat de koffie koud wordt"" biedt een koffiehuis haar klanten de mogelijkheid om terug te keren in de tijd. Je kan door de tijd reizen, maar enkel en alleen onder de voorwaarden van het huis. En één van die strenge voorwaarden is dat je door terug te reizen naar het verleden de werkelijkheid in het heden niet kunt beïnvloeden of veranderen, hoezeer je je ook zou inspannen of hoe graag je dat zou willen. Vóór je de vier verhalen waaruit dit boekje bestaat leest, creëer je een verwachtingshorizon op basis van dat uitgangspunt, iets waar de titels je bij helpen. Maar toch verrassen elk van deze korte verhalen, elk op hun ontroerende manier. Ze gaan crescendo naarmate je vordert in de roman. Alle verhalen hebben dezelfde personages, maar de auteur zoomt in op het perspectief en de verlangens of de problemen van telkens een ander personage. Vooral ""Zussen - Over een vrouw die van huis wegliep en haar zusje dat veel eet"" weet te raken, en - voor mij persoonlijk - komt het laatste verhaal (""Ouder en kind - Over de zwangere vrouw die in het koffiezaakje werkt"") nog steviger binnen. Een aangrijpend en ontroerend debuut van deze Japanse schrijver . Voor mensen die van koffie houden én van de beschrijving hoe die koffie minutieus klaargemaakt wordt.

It was very interesting and fun to read about the lives of these people. I liked how everyone in the cafe was so friendly and concerned about each other. Some parts of the book were kinda boring, and the narration was not very appealing. The characters were praised again and again, almost redundantly, it was as if the author was forcing the readers to like the characters. That was really annoying. Like...stop! I get it, they are excellent, but where are the flaws? So that was a bummer. I'd like to share these lines that I liked a lot. When in the presence of someone with whom you have a bond, and to whom you have entrusted your feelings, it is hard to lie and get away with it. The truth just wants to come flowing out. This is especially the case when you are trying to hide your sadness and vulnerability. Absolutely agreed! I've experienced this a lot of times, and the author has expressed it in a very accurate manner. I also want to let you know beforehand that there's no science behind the time travel in this book, it's happening due to unknown reasons. All in all, it was a pleasant read.

Like most translated fiction from Japan, the writing has an almost detached quality that could turn some people off, but I always find that I respond much more positively to the understated nature of such writing, rather than intentionally lyrical prose that seems hell-bent on making you cry. This book contains four short stories, all connected and featuring the same cast of characters and a time-traveling seat that only allows users to stay in the visited timeline until the coffee they are served gets cold. Up until yesterday, I believed that time travel was not a trope for me but this book completely changed my mind. This book is an engrossing exploration of grief, but also of hope. While it starts off on a light note and ends with a sense of tremendous loss, and to be honest I am still tearing up while writing this review, I'm so happy I got to read this book and what it taught me along the way."

Through a relatable cast of characters we see the pangs of regret and tenderness that time brings; so often we think we have all the time in the world to make amends, or that we were the ones who were right, only to realize, too late, that there was another side to the story. We also see that sometimes closure is not a drastic turn of events, but rather a new perspective. Each story, though with different characters and outcomes, are both somber and hopeful. This concept is one that is resonating because it is desired by so many; who wouldn't want just one more cup of coffee with a loved one lost?

It starts somewhat confusing, who is who in Japan? Furthermore the writer tends to meander in the description of the timetravellers backgrounds, so as a reader you are unsure what is important. While for example there is no attention to the question of why there is only one (in time) pouring the coffee. Also there is some repetition, as if there are four separate stories. Which is not the case: at the end the storylines come together nicely. The power of the book is more fundamental. Especially the second chapter about dementia resonates strongly. Why do people want to go back in time? Because there is love and loss, illness, family and freedom, life and death. And there is the not knowing, the regret not having said, not having asked. Sitting in your chair, reading this book, you can take heart, there still remains a way."

No, it's not a new Stephen King.From my (limited) reading experience, Japanese literature tends to be either quite serious and abstract (Murakami) or seriously radical (Mishima).Toshikazu Kawaguchi's poignant novel, “Before the coffee gets cold”, was a big surprise for me, because the synopsis that we can read in the Picador 2019 edition says that it is about “time travel”. Now that I've finished the book, I know I'd be disappointed if it was really about time travel.It was an even bigger surprise to discover that, despite Kawaguchi presenting us with the most curious and rigorous set of protocols for returning to the past or advancing to the future, these rules are not a display of high-tech pyrotechnics as in any Hollywood sci-fi plot, but they are the dominant and conditioning element of the story, or should I say stories, because the book is built around four different characters; stories that, as they evolve, intertwine to form one. With these rules, in the absence of a real-life magical cafe, Kawaguchi encourages readers to value the time they spend with their loved ones, now.The narrative, smooth and fluid, invites the reader to reflect on the fundamental question: what would you change if you could go back in time? For me, Kawaguchi wanted to convey to us the importance of all of us facing reality, expressing our feelings, not presuming we know what others think or feel and not hiding from those who love us what hurts us the most. That is the reason for the absolutely unavoidable rules of steel.Each bittersweet visit to the past or future brings the visitor joy and comfort, but also a renewed sense of pain and loss.The four central characters are all women; charismatic, each in their own way, their individual narratives are gradually and delicately intertwined to produce a story of love, loss and hope that is sure to touch the reader's most sentimental strings.Kawaguchi possesses an astounding literary ability to find lasting emotional resonance, woven into what initially seems like a lighthearted story about the mundane events one might find in any family story, where existential riddles of love and loss, family and freedom, life and death spin before our eyes.The setting is as superb as it is simplistic (explained by the fact that Kawaguchi is primarily a playwright), and the charm of the gloomy old cafe feels like a dream far beyond the appeal to time travel imagery; it is also a magical space in itself, like an oasis in the middle of the sands of the ""desert"" called Tokyo. The narrative in its brilliance and romanticism, temptingly invites us, through a smooth progression, to focus on the emotions of the human condition, rather than the dramatic and suspenseful pseudoscientific subplots. By examining how humans deal with the physical and psychological loss of a loved one, the author is teaching us an exciting lesson as important as life itself.With a tender look at the beauty of things that are brief and fleeting, Kawaguchi creates a deeply moving and shifting journey to the desire to cling to the past. This wonderful tale will be a truly memorable and captivating reading experience for anyone."
202,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54017095-kia,Rating 5 out of 5,"Before the Coffee Gets Cold is a heartwarming Japanese novel originally written by Toshikazu Kawaguchi, and translated into English by Geoffrey Trousselot. The novel tells about the existence of a cafe called Funiculi Funicula, which was famous for its ‘urban legend’ story: the café has a capability to make its customers to go back in time. It has a long list to follow in order the achieve time travel; and it only has one seat which is almost always occupied by a ghost.The story revolves around the life of four major characters who chose to travel back time, each with a unique story: a beautiful and smart woman who wanted to amend her relationship with her boyfriend, who left her to travel abroad; a middle-aged nurse who wanted to retrieve a letter from her Alzheimer patient and husband; a woman who desired to reunite with her sister; and an ill cafe co-owner who wanted to see and talk to her child she’s been expecting to have. While each of the story was brief and too fictional, it gave a strong theatrical vibe, as it was originally made as a play prior to its adaptation to a novel. For someone with high expectations for its novel-like qualities, it could come off as inadequate and unsatisfying. The four stories, however, provided a lot of emotional influence and wisdom, which I really enjoyed. Between the confusing existence of the ghost and the bizarre description of the café, its reverberating dramatic concept also drew my interest, which I think was the very center motive of the book.
Water flows from high places to low places. That is the nature of gravity. Emotions also seem to act according to gravity. When in the presence of someone with whom you have a bond, and to whom you have entrusted your feelings, it is hard to lie and get away with it. The truth just wants to come flowing out. This is especially the case when you are trying to hide your sadness or vulnerability. It is much easier to conceal sadness from a stranger, or from someone you don’t trust.

There was too much explaining about what were Japanese customs, something a person from Japan reading it in the original Japanese wouldn’t have needed to read.The “rules” made the time travel less interesting to me. At times I connected with the characters but I never felt that close to them and their experiences. Much was predictable. There was too much repetition, especially for such a short book. The message about the heart changing was lovely I suppose but I couldn’t get into this sparsely told story. I liked it mostly because the premise is intriguing.This is a short quick read. I read it in two days, two chapters a day. There are four characters and each one’s story is told in a very long chapter. I appreciated the information given about each character before and after their unique experiences. I would have liked to know more about the one woman customer who has a role in all four chapters. I was left mostly indifferent though to both the characters and the opportunity they’d had. I was touched by certain things but some things had me feeling angry and (in not a good way) sad, especially in the last story. I felt as though in the most important way that all of them squandered their chance, even though it wasn’t much of a chance.I read this for my real world book club and I suspect that most members will have a lot of thoughts and feelings they’ll want to discuss. My guess is that for once I’ll have the least to contribute. I liked it well enough but I think that more could have been done with it and I think that it could have been better. Perhaps I’d have preferred to see it as a stage play."

Good things about the book: Simple characters, simpler story arcs, innovative use of time travel and very good delivery of the author's message on positivity, inner strength and hope. However, this book doesn't really deliver on the science-fiction element, leaving us with repetition of the original idea and a ton of questions without any answers. ( I do get that there is a sequel, so maybe all hope is not lost!)Recommend it to those who are looking for small and crisp fiction books or precursors to heavy Japanese Literature ( read: Murakami) !

“I was so absorbed in the things that I couldn’t change, I forgot the most important thing.” 
i really love that it highlights the need for closure and how it affects people as human beings in general. I do think you need to be able to relate to the stories to be feel deeply invested and it’s unfortunate that out of the three stories, I was only partly invested in certain very specific scenes. It’s not too heavy and was a welcome side read from my other heartbreaking and intense read. It has the right amount of nostalgic and poignancy that won’t leave you too destroyed.— 3.5 —⇢ content warnings// Alzheimer's disease, Car accident, Chronic illness, Death, Pregnancy, Terminal illness "

215,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120198641-la-crosse-county-library,Rating 3 out of 5,"I first ran across Toshikazu Kawaguchi's Before the Coffee Gets Cold on some kind of top-debut authors list, so when I came across the actual book among new selections at the library, I already had it on my radar. The tease on the cover, ""What would you change if you could travel back in time?"" hooked me enough to give it a try. Who doesn't have a regret or two or missed opportunity in the past to reconsider? I'm much more of a suspense, thriller, try to figure out the mystery kind of reader rather than fantasy, but we all need a change of pace once in a while. The author notes indicated his background was as a playwright, so the 4 ""chapters"" in the table of contents soon made sense with the same stage set the entire book. An almost novella-type layout of the stories of the intertwined characters certainly made for a quick read with no natural breaks except between ""Acts"". What reader wants to set down a book before the end of the chapter?!It was a slow start. An interesting type of back-and-forth between first-person and narrator format with the first-person in italicized font that disrupted the voice in my head at times. I longed for greater character development, at least for the staff at the café. Some of that would come in the last act, but it made it more difficult to keep everyone straight without a vivid picture of who was who. Maybe that's what in fact helped push me to the end: the mystery of who these people really are.I found the final scenes to be thrown together to wrap-up the story. It was like a chapter on Fumiko and Goro was left out and the full backstory of the ghost and whether she had replaced others before her was missing to satisfy me. However, I see the follow-up Tales from the Café is now available, and sounds like it tackles our ghost. Just too many other things to read first to rush to find out.The rules of time travel soon make it apparent to most that it isn't worth the effort. Whatever you did in the past cannot change the present. In the end, I took away the notion to put regrets aside. If you had done something differently, you'd likely be in the same spot today anyway. A good message to consider the opportunity to just let some things go. For mystery/suspense readers, it's not as far off our genre as you'd think. There are tidbits of puzzles easy enough to piece together, or to think you are. In the end, nothing I'd encourage you to run out and read right away, but add it to your reading list and enjoy it as a quick read. I would definitely recommend it to those who find themselves hanging too much on the past. Unless you are stone-hearted, you may just even shed a tear or two.Find this book and other titles on our catalog."

Drink the coffee before it goes cold.”A beautiful collection of 4 different stories that somehow resonate and harmonize into one. There is this old cafe where one can travel time, considering a specific set of rules. “At the end of the day, whether one returns to the past or travels to the future, the present doesn't change.”All four stories carry the situation where if one travels time, the present remains the same. This makes one reckon- What exactly does change? It is the view toward a particular situation. It alters how a person sees or feels in certain situations or times. Though the novel as a whole is very admirable, I inclined more towards a story of a husband and wife. That one story bought out both aww and tears in my eyes simultaneously. The feeling of seeing your husband forget and lose his memory to Alziemers, ignoring the mere existence of a relationship that made you go through all life’s ups and downs, can be so heart-wrenching. Hence, I cried my heart out. “no matter what difficulties people face, they will always have the strength to overcome them. It just takes heart.”So many life lessons, so many adventures. So many conversations and so many regrets. This book has it all. I love it! I cherish it!

232,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28372189-rachel-not-currently-receiving-notifications-hall,Rating 2 out of 5,"Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu KawaguchiThere is a message to the four stories but it takes a lot of sticking with to find and appreciate it!Before the Coffee Gets Cold was initially penned as a stage play and consists of four stories that take place in a basement café in Tokyo called Funiculi Funicula that, thanks to a magazine article discussing its potential for time travel, has become something of an urban legend. The rules however are very onerous with the biggest sticking point that even if one revisits the past and behaves differently, the present won’t change. Given that most people want to go back and actually alter something the number of customers wishing to travel is minimal. Furthermore travellers need to be sitting in a specific seat that is vacated only fleetingly by its occupier and along with both parties needing to have visited the café before, a trip only lasts until just before their cup of coffee turns cold.Four stories follow with a cast of eight or so characters appearing throughout, the first of which is entitled ‘The Lovers’ and features career-driven young businesswoman, Fumiko, wishing she had told her boyfriend how she really felt following his announcement that he was moving away to work. ‘Husband and Wife’ tells the story of a woman whose husband has been hit by early-onset Alzheimer’s and ‘The Sister’ gives a woman the opportunity to see her sister again for one final time. The final story, ‘Mother and Child’, revolves around the café proprietor, his wife and their unborn child and ties in with an earlier story to provide a glimpse into their future.The prose is simple and occasionally a little clunky and across the four stories there is a great deal of repetition, largely related to the convoluted rules of time travel in Funiculi Funicula which are constantly reiterated. Given all the stories are only around 50 pages I found this crowded out any chance of them evoking strong emotion or even revealing more about the characters. Kawaguchi apparently wanted “to write meaningfully about human emotions” but his characters are insubstantial and perfunctory, making it difficult to distinguish one from another. I was unsure whether this lack of emotion was an attempt to portray the typical Japanese reserve and restraint of the culture or not but either way it felt like there was an invisible barrier between the characters and the reader audience.Whilst I appreciated the takeaway from this novel that re-evaluating a situation, changing one’s attitude and making peace with the past can go just as far as actually changing events, I did feel that it needed to be made far more overt. The concept that sitting in a specific chair can be the vehicle needed to encourage a change of heart is original and clever. Although the four stories are unashamedly sentimental this never really came across and I was disappointed to be left pretty unmoved by the book. Hard work for minimal reward."
233,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129459618-kate,Rating 5 out of 5,"This collection of 4 short stories is one of the most meaningful things I have ever read. I enjoyed each story so much. Although time traveling is a very common subject, I felt that this book explored it on a much deeper and more unique level. The time travel rules fit the premise very well and allows for the characters’ experiences to be more genuine. I like how each character learned something from each experience and had some character development despite not being able to change the present. I like that even though each story revolves around different characters, the previous characters are still somewhat present. Reading this truly warmed my heart and made me feel a sense of gratitude. SPOILERS AHEAD: The husband and wife, and mother and child stories hit me so hard. 😭😭😭😭😭 The realities of patients who suffer from dementia, Alzheimer’s, etc. is indeed saddening. Reading about it in this book was even more heartbreaking. The letter that the husband wrote to the wife made me feel so emotional. I found it so wholesome that the wife continued to stick by his side even though his memory of her faded and even though his only thought of her remaining was as his nurse. When Miki when back to the past to take the picture with her mother and then the mother realized that was actually her daughter omg. It is all so sad but somewhat wholesome because the characters get some closure and ability to bond still. It was so emotional when Miki thanked her mother for giving Miki a life and when her mother said it was an honour to have her. Also when Kei kept feeling sorry for not being able to be there for her as a mother but then realizing Miki had the support of Nagare, Kazu, etc. 😭 Knowing that everything was gonna be okay for her daughter.

It's juts a law at this point. I thought it would be a quirky novel about a peculiar cafe in Japan, which lets its visitors go back in time for a limited time to meet anyone who has been to that cafe, and has to get back ""before the coffee gets cold"" (and a whole other host of rules), but it's so much more than that.It's a story about family, friendships, hope, endurance, love and dreams. Each chapter deals with a different relationship that's affected by this time-travel aspect of the cafe, and it left me WEEPING! I also knew there's a movie adaptation, that I'm definitely watching soon, and I'm really excited to read the rest of the books in this series. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! "

For a book that’s only 213 pages, this was so impactful. I went into the story without knowing anything, and I’m so glad I did because it’s unlike anything I’ve read before. I didn’t have any sort of expectations, but this blew me away. This was the first ever translated book I’ve read and while I understand that the writing isn’t for everybody, I thought it was simple yet beautiful. Things get lost in translation but even then, I feel like the story translated pretty well. The beginning was slow and a bit confusing but omg once I figured out the plot, I was HOOKED. I loved how there were four short stories, but they were all interconnected in a way and followed the same characters. Each story stood on its own, they were individually and collectively amazing and poignant. I’m obsessed with the coffee shop, I got such warm and cozy vibes from it. I loved how this book tackled all different kinds of relationships such as ex lovers, married couples, sisters, and parents/children. It was an emotional read, and the message of the story was executed so well. Such a heartfelt book, I’m for sure reading the second one! <333"

I know it's a polarizing read for many people, but for me it was okay: short, wholesome and sweet. I got upset at times because it seemed the author was just trying to make me cry on purpose (which he didn't manage to by the way, and I cry for literally anything) and was a bit repetitive, but I loved the concept and even if the execution was not entirely perfect for me, I still enjoyed reading it.

In the cafe, if you want to travel you need to be familiar with the rules. Stay seated and have your coffee before it gets cold. However, if you wanted to travel to the past or to the future you have to know that no matter what you do the present isn’t going to change. This was a great story. I felt so deeply connected to the characters and to their miseries. Also, it kept me on the edge sometimes I was really stressed when someone was time traveling and thought they are not going to be able to finish the coffee before it gets cold.🫣"

Вместо това - можеш да промениш себе си.Едно кафене се е превърнало в градска легенда и то с основание. Може да те отведе на пътуване в миналото, а както ще видим после - и в бъдещето. Обаче, има строги правила: 1. Можеш да срещнеш само хора, които са посещавали кафенето. 2. Не можеш да промениш миналото. 3. Трябва да седиш на точно определен стол.4. Имаш време, докато изстине кафето. Защо да пътуваш в миналото, ако нямаш право да го промениш? Това е основният въпрос, на който тази книжка се опитва да даде отговор. Въпросите, свързани с парадоксите на пътуване във времето, са едни от най-интересните теми за fiction новели. Също за кино индустрията, за философки дебати, за астро-физични диспути и на какви ли още не платформи. Авторът от страната на изгряващото слънце се вкопчва в тази питанка и се опитва да ни даде примерни илюстративни отговори. Проследяват се няколко конкретни истории. Всички те са свързани с любовни отношения - семейства, влюбена двойка, съпрузи. Всички са изправени пред някакво изпитание - от прозаичното пътуване по работа в чужбина, до тежки заболявания. И това скромно, старомодно кафене е натоварено с ролята да им помогне в житейския им път с едно кратко прескачане напред-назад във времето. Колко кратко - еми, колкото да не изстине кафето. Пътуването струва всичко на всичко към 6.50 лв. Проверих по курса на йената колко е. Малко е множко за чаша кафе, ама е нищо за time travel по задена дата от клиента. Както винаги - обичам да се впускам на приключения във времето, а и кой читател не обича. Това точно приключение ми дойде малко по-захаросано за моя вкус. Липсваше ми още дълбочина, също и още действие. Механизмът е по-статичен от приключенски роман - все пак правилото е да си седиш на стола и да пиеш кафето, докато не изстине. Може да се приеме за приятно четиво, с опит да ни трогне и накара да се размислим. Набляга на наблюдателност и цели определени житейски поуки. Накрая оставя вкус на студено кафе - действа, но ти се ще да е току-що пуснато еспресо от машината - по-богато на вкусове и аромати, по-енергизиращо................... ENGYou can't change the past. This is a rule. Instead, you can change yourself.A cafe has become an urban legend, and rightly so. It can take you on a journey into the past, and as we will see later - into the future. However, there are strict rules:1. You can only meet people who have visited the cafe.2. You can't change the past.3. You have to sit in a specific chair.4. You have time before the coffee gets cold.Why travel to the past if you can't change it? This is the main question this book is trying to answer. Questions related to the paradoxes of time travel are some of the most interesting topics for fiction stories. Also for the film industry, for philosophical debates, for astro-physical disputes and on many other platforms. The author from the country of the rising sun clings to this question and tries to give us sample illustrative answers. Several specific stories are traced. They are all related to love relationships - families, a couple in love, spouses. Everyone is facing a test - from the prosaic business trip abroad, to serious illness. And this modest, old-fashioned cafe is tasked with helping them on their way of life with a short jump back and forth in time. How short - well, just before the coffee gets cold. The trip costs all in all about EUR 3.30. I checked the exchange rate of the yen to see how much it is.As always - I like to embark on adventures in time, and which reader does not. This exact adventure came to me a little more sugary for my taste. I lacked more depth, also more action. The mechanism is more static than an adventure novel - after all, the rule is to sit in a chair and drink coffee until it cools down. It can be considered a pleasant read, with an attempt to move us and make us think. Emphasizes observation and aims at certain life lessons. In the end, it leaves a taste of cold coffee - it works, but you wish it had just been espresso from the machine - richer in flavors and aromas, more energizing."

253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666003-silvana,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is my third (or fourth?) foray to Japanese SFF. I could not remember where I got the recommendation but it is one of the very, very few novels that I'd like to read upon reading its title. See, I'm a coffee addict and probably a bit of a snob too LOL. I said to Gabi - one of my reading buddies - that I love hanging out at coffee shops because you could be alone and with people at the same time. Reading this novel brings back that memory. I love small coffee shops where you could chat with the owners/baristas/waiters, not just come-pay-get your drink routine we have in the bigger chains. I love traditional coffee stalls that's usually get crowded in the mornings with (mostly) old men or families getting their coffee or breakfast. Indonesia is one of the big producers of coffee - the word Java comes from us - so we have a strong coffee culture.Well, okay, about the novel now. It's not just the nostalgic feels I got from reading it - last time I was in a coffee shop was February 2020 - but the simplicity of telling the lives of the characters - all everyday people like you and me - and personal tribulations - which were relatable - just struck the right chord within me. If you enjoy reading about people's relationships - sibling, lovers, families, friends - then this might be a book for you. How about the SFF aspect? Well, it's a time travel story, in short. Not much is new but I guess it's not the point. Again, the charm of this novel is about finding answers (or lack of) in life and how people would react if they're given the choice of going back in time or travel to the future. Was it sentimental? melancholic? Yes. But it's my type of sentimental and melancholy so that's why the four stars."

It is a whimsical, yet deeply profound book. I love that it is set in a coffee shop.. a space where people come to sit, enjoy, reflect and in this case, have the opportunity to travel backwards or forwards through time, under strict conditions. Before the coffee gets cold tells four different stories about four of the regular coffee shop customers and workers... each one choosing to step back or forward in time to find out something that was unspoken, unseen, not done, in order to explain something in the present.However, there are strict conditions that must be adhered to by anyone wishing to partake of this experience:* nothing you can do while in the past can change the present;* the only people you can meet while in the past are those who have visited the cafe;* there is only one seat in the cafe where you can travel through time;* you cannot leave this seat while doing so;* there is a time limit... you are served a coffee as you commence and you must be back before the coffee gets cold.Each of the time travellers in this story have differing reasons for wanting to partake. And while no element of the present can be changed, future trajectories can and do alter. This little story is profound in its wisdom. It certainly leaves me in a reflective and meditative space which I love. 5 big stars for that."

Nors kiekvieno iš jų tikslas skiriasi, visų kelionės ir likimai labai gražiai susipina tarpusavyje.⠀⠀Ir nors fantastikos elementai, man dažnai ""nelimpa"", šią savotišką laiko turizmo idėją prisijaukinau labai lengvai. Neleidau sau ieškoti priekabių, vietomis praignoravau logikos spragas, neretai pasitaikančias, kai kalba pasisuka apie ne itin realius dalykus.⠀⠀Galiu pažadėt, kad skaitant, ateities/praeities įvykius atspėsit iš karto, bet tai nei kiek negadins skaitymo malonumo, nes svarbiausia knygoje ne pačios kelionės laiku, o jų atnešta nauda. Susitaikymas, supratimas, požiūrio į neišvengiamus dalykus pakeitimas. Knyga tokia paprasta, bet paliekanti labai gerą jausmą. Nes šildyt gali ne tik kava, bet ir tinkamu laiku perskaityta istorija. ⠀"

258,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,Rating 3 out of 5,"This was a sweet collection of interconnected stories, all based around one time-travelling cafe with a lot of rules. It was quite sentimental, and dealt with some quite dark topics which genuinely surprised me. But I found the way this was written to be a little too removed and bare bones for me. I'm not surprised this was adapted into a novel from a play, because it reads like a play - both in its use of a single setting, and also in the way characters' clothing is heavily described. I found the repetitive nature of the time travelling concept (and the fact it had to be explained over and over again) very frustrating - it felt like the author thought his readers were dumb and wouldn't grasp the fairly simple concept. As a result of this, plus the stark writing, I felt kind of removed from the characters and didn't feel the right level of emotion I assume the author expected from certain revelations. But it was an easy read and I did enjoy it overall, it just didn't wow me."

Non abbiamo certo il nuovo Dostoevskij qui, nessun dubbio, ma non mi pare che qualcuno l'abbia mai preteso. Personalmente l'ho trovata una lettura piacevole e carina, mi ha dato un senso di tenerezza in un periodo abbastanza stancante.

I had high hopes for this book, but it just didn't hit the mark for me.First off, the characters felt kind of flat. I couldn't really connect with them because they lacked depth and development. It's like they were stuck in one emotional state throughout the whole story, which made it hard to care about what happened to them. I wish the author had given them more complexity and growth.The pacing was all over the place. Some parts dragged on forever, while others felt rushed and glossed over. It was hard to find a good rhythm while reading, and that made it tough to stay focused. And the transitions between different time periods and storylines were confusing af.The whole concept of time travel through a cafe was interesting, but it wasn't explored as much as I had hoped. I wanted deep dives into the philosophical and emotional consequences of changing the past, but instead, it focused too much on mundane stuff.The writing style itself didn't do much for me either, it fell flat. It felt like I was just going through the motions, reading words without feeling anything. Now, it's not all bad. There were a few moments that hit me right in the feels and made me ponder the fleeting nature of time and the weight of regret. Those moments showed the potential of the book, but they were few and far between.Overall, Before the Coffee Gets Cold just didn't do it for me. The characters felt shallow, the pacing was off, the concept wasn't fully explored, and the writing was dull. Bonus points? It's really short if you're interested in a time travel themed book and can overlook its flaws🤷‍♀️"

Ak čítate knižky od autorov rôznych národností, tak viete o čom hovorím. Každá ""časť sveta"" píše trošku inak a pri tejto knižke to pocítite. Ale zároveň uznávam, že táto kniha má taký ten príjemný štýl, kedy si vezmete do ruky šálku kávy a budete sa pozerať na západ slnka s dobrým pocitom. Je to hlboké, magické a upokojujúce. Hoci je to oficiálne vedené ako poviedky, všetky sú navzájom poprepájané. Možno na prvýkrát nepochopíte, prečo sa tu autor takto ""rozšupol"" s opismi a hodil sem túto nepodstatnú informáciu, ale neskôr sa všetko spojí.Moja najobľúbenejšia poviedka je rozhodne druhá s názvom ""Manželia"". Je tak krásne smutno-šťastná, že keď som ju dočítala, tak som ju musela ešte raz spracovať a precítiť. Jednoducho nádhera.Feel good pre dospelých? Prečo nie! Hoci sa tu píše o chorobe, smrti či rozchode, stále sa to tak pozitívne zakončí, že to zahreje viac ako dobre urobené espresso.

Z tego względu trochę bałam się tej książki, a z drugiej mocno mnie do niej ciągnęło. Okazało się, że motyw przenoszenia się w czasie nadaje tej historii magii, która mogłaby skraść moje serce, gdyby nie wykonanie.Ta opowieść ma ogromny potencjał, więc żałuję, że (w moim odczuciu) nie został wykorzystany. Zdaję sobie sprawę z tego, iż azjatycka literatura różni się od naszej, natomiast mimo wszystko zbyt wiele tu chaosu, powtórzeń oraz braku skupienia się na emocjach, a zwracanie uwagę po raz kolejny na wygląd kawiarni bądź ubiór bohaterów. Gdyby Toshikazu Kawaguchi skupił się na innych aspektach powieści - byłoby to coś fenomenalnego. Teraz jest po prostu - bardzo średnio.Niemniej nie ukrywam, że momentami byłam zaangażowana i ta książka ma w sobie coś, co daje do myślenia.

Also, it’s heartwarming and has that ‘chicken soup for soul’ kinda storylines. Characters interactions were nice to read.HOWEVER, the stories has that….Idk how to describe it…it’s too predictable, cliche, and cheesy ?I’ll be honest, it was like reading those ‘heartwarming’ internet stories (not that bad though)I just couldn’t take the conflicts seriously at all, and felt seriously detached from the character emotions which is bad. The only thing that stayed with me is the concept which I really liked. Also, the writing…it felt too descriptive and all over the place ? I mean too many characters introduce at once is not good for my dumb brain.Overall, a good read but I think it wasn’t complex or developed enough which makes it a bit of a wasted potential.I’ll still recommend it though.RTC maybe."

The concept of the book, the stories, the feelings, the emotions, the perspective - all were outstanding. I'm just utterly disappointed at the execution. ""If you could go back in time, who would you meet?"" It's a question that provoked our thoughts for millenia. Personally, l don't have an urge to go back to the past or go forward to the future. But still, there are so many unfinished stories in the world, so many untold words. So many goodbyes left unsaid. Even if we couldn’t change the present, the opportunity to do some unfinished business is tempting. The name of the book was one of my favourites. It was quite lyrical. While reading this book, l imagined the whole time that l was holding a cup of lukewarm coffee with both hands and humming to myself - 🎼 Before the coffee gets cold... 🎼 The stories were really wholesome. They stirred emotions in me l didn't know l had. They showed me that past, present and future are connected. Travelling through time may not change the circumstances, but changes the person nevertheless. The characters were each unique and written in fine detail. The freedom-seeker Hirai, caring Nagre, friendly Kei, optimist Kohtake, unnerved Kazu - all of them were astounding. The only thing that let the whole book down was the writing style, although, l don't know if it’s the writer's fault or the translator's or both. Some of the sentences were great, but most of the time it felt like a kid had written it. Also there were too much description of everyday doings. While the description of making coffee added much to the building of characters, the rest were just junk. If not for that, this book would've been one of my lifetime favourites. Thank you Rajeswari  for providing the book."

You are brought said coffee which indeed looks like a cup of coffee but when you take the first sip, you are met with an unpleasant liquid that barely tastes like coffee. This is how this book felt. I was ridiculously intrigued with the concept of this book but with every sip I take, it gets really cold and stale!A combination of a cup of coffee, a cafe, a chair and a ghost allows people to travel in time. A so-called time travel story that feels like pinning four greeting cards together and reading them straight through. The writer has made an amateurish attempt to write a story that is synonymous with making a cup of coffee:-The writing is like the boiling water that begins at a slow pace but unlike the transparent water, the writing barely satisfies someone's thirst. Several repeated phrases and awful descriptions. There's an overdose of coffee powder that signifies the use of forced emotions between the characters, which surely makes the story too bitter to even taste. A substantial need for sugar signifies the need for characterization in the story. The characters seem annoying and unemotional and their personalities are irrelevant to the story. The character names- Kazu, Kei and Kohtake are often confused.Milk! The element that holds the strength of coffee. Likewise, the rules in the book that determine the nature of time travel. The writer adds some milk with a pale complexion that fails to satisfy the logic behind the execution of time travel makes the story too sloppy. And yes, there isn't a cat in the story unlike the cover reflects.Overall, this book as a whole was a letdown. Sadly, it became a prime example of the right idea, wrong execution. If there's an underlying message in the story, then it'd turn out to be wasted potential."

I know they all have their nuances, but this was a really unique take on the concept. What if you could travel to any time by sitting at a specific booth in a coffee shop but had to return before your coffee got cold. Because of your short time, you could really only talk to someone who is in the coffee shop at that particular time. Nothing you do in the past will change the future. If you don't make it back in time there are dire consequences. These are a lot of rules.Perhaps such a narrow definition of time travel could have made a good short story. That seems to be what the author tried to do here. The novel is just four very simple short stories strung together. There just doesn't seem to be enough going on to hold the novel together. It needed a lot more. It wasn't bad, just slow and a little dull. "

Bello il discorso dei viaggi nel tempo e vagamente commovente una delle storie narrate. Il resto per me era solo scrittura graziosa fino alla noia, descrizioni minuziose dell'abbigliamento di ogni singolo personaggio (ma perché? Cosa aggiunge alla narrazione?) e ripetizione delle regole per viaggiare nel tempo. Uff, che peccato."

In a magical coffee shop that can let them travel back in time to fulfill that goal. It's a cozy and charming book to read. A little bittersweet and heartwarming. It discusses each character's shortcomings, things they've taken for granted, mistakes, regrets, grief, and a chance to re-evaluate their life decisions. It took me a while to get along with the book and its characters. But I still enjoyed the concept. A pretty nice book to start reading in a coffee shop and finish before the coffee gets cold."

It literally only happens in a few minutes and there are a lot of complicated rules surrounding it. You need to do everything before your coffee gets cold or it's over for you. A good short read with four different stories, and maybe that is why I didn't feel connected with any characters as there is not much time for character development. While I did feel emotional in some scenes, this book doesn't really meet my expectations. Up until the very end, I'm still hoping that we will get some backstory about the girl in the dress but I guess not."

314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67269664-mridula-gupta,Rating 4 out of 5,"What if a cafe allowed you to go back in time and have a different conversation with someone you love, someone who is not with you anymore?Before the Coffee Gets Cold takes us to one such cafe, with its rich and lush history, a mysterious ambience that has been maintained through generations, and a quirky rumour that is apparently very much true.-The concept of time travel has been used repeatedly in books, but what makes this one different is the lesson it leaves behind. We meet four different visitors, each looking for answers or closure, knowing fully well that the present will not change irrespective of their actions during the brief time travel the cafe allows.-Before the Coffee Gets Cold has an appealing subject. There isn't much happening throughout the story, but the time travel and the characters with their flaws and pain weave a compelling tale. It teaches us compassion, acceptance, love, honestly and the significance of relationships.The story left me wistful with its calm and composed storytelling. Time travel has been used as a medium to effectively convey human emotions and actions. The entire story has been narrated by four narrators, the ones traveling back in time to confront their past to gain some information from the time that has been lost.-The prose, however, feels disjointed at places and I would attribute it to the translation. The tale is whimsical and poignant, with well-shaped characters, exemplary elements and a story that adds up to something meaningful. But the jarring translation makes it a bit difficult to feel the story in its entirety. The beginning especially, where too many characters were introduced, the simultaneous building of a backdrop and creating relations between the characters was exhausting and confusing to read, but as the story unfolded a lot of it started to make sense (tbh, I don't do well with too many characters 😅). Kawaguchi's writing is also visually appealing, making it easy to build the world in our head.I would recommend this to you nevertheless because it is just like any other Japanese short story but also very unlike anything I have come across. It sucks you in, but you have to acclimatize a bit to the translation."
315,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1123165-hirondelle,Rating 2 out of 5,"Really popular right now, a japanese novel (based on a play?) about a bar with regulars where somehow, clients can time travel (with many many rules and restrictions). Almost like 4 short stories interconnected, with plot from each sprinkled round the others. I have this vague intention of reading more sf and fantasy written in languages other than english, I thought this would fit, it did not. The time travel element is not very deep for people who read sf regularly, I kept finding holes in the roles, or ways to exploit it (human nature...) but the characters just did not go there. It ends up being a bit soppy : Japanese women being pro-active and pursuing emotional relationships even if the Japanese men (or parents) seem totally unworthy of the effort. Also the whole women dying tragically for the entertainment of readers, presumably other women, so they get a good cry, I am not a fan of that, but hey maybe it is my heart which is defective or something and this is more moving than I found it.I also really did not like the translation and that did not help. I get translating from the japanese into english (or other indo-european language) will be difficult, but this translation felt both crazily confusing, and kind of flat. There was a lot of omniscient narrative exposition (which OK, I am not blaming translator for) but with verbal tenses switches in the middle of the paragraph. The narrator keeps talking of cord sandals (what? espadrilles? rope sandals? canvas sneakers?), he calls wallets purses and handbags ""pouches"" and those are just examples. Interesting, but not for me."

Innym umyka całkowicie, pozostaje jednym z przypadków tendencji fetyszyzowania opowieści rodem z Japonii (nawet tych najzwyklejszych). Przyznać trzeba – fenomenem jest.Opowieść kameralna i na wskroś japońska. Prosta i minimalistyczna w formie. Poruszająca serce i niezobowiązująca w swojej prostocie.

Ανθρώπινες σχέσεις που ξετυλίγονται μπροστά από ένα φλυτζάνι αχνιστού ροφήματος, ενοχές, τύψεις, ελπίδα για το μέλλον. Κι όλα αυτά πριν κρυώσει ο καφές.Αν και λάτρης της λογοτεχνίας του φανταστικού, ποτέ δε με έπεισαν οι ιστορίες με χρονομηχανές, κυρίως γιατί δεν τις βρίσκω αρκετά καλοδουλεμένες στις μικρές τους λεπτομέρειες.

Το βιβλίο αυτό, αν και δεν αποτελεί εξαίρεση, μου δίνει την αίσθηση πως χρησιμοποίησε το ταξίδι στο χρόνο ως πρόσχημα κι όχι ως αυτοσκοπό.

2.5/5 🌟
I was very much interested with the concept of a coffee shop sending people back in time. Time travel fictions are always my thing. This could also be my thing, if it wasn't so bland.There are four mini stories in this book, all with different events to tell. The premise itself is not the problem, but I think the execution is sloppy and not very solid. I think it tried but failed to convey the emotions it wanted to deliver, for a kind of story that depended hugely on sentimentality and feelings. I don't know if the story being translated lessen the vibe that it intended to give. Whether it was because of the original author or the translator, the writing ruined it for me. This is a short book and I didn't regret reading this. It's not really bad, it's just dull for my taste. I would have given this 3 stars if I'm being generous, but the fact the it took me 3 whole days to finish a book when it's supposed to be a quick read only goes to show I have a not very enthusiastic reading experience with this one. I'm still willing to continue with the series, but I'm going to have a lower expectation for the next books."
