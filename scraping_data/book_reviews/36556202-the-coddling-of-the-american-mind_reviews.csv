0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,Rating 2 out of 5,"This is a very narrow and small-minded book parading as a big thoughtful one. It says it is about the American Mind, but the data and the theory only support ""the coddling"" of a very narrow subset of the American mind: upper middle class college kids born after 1995 that got to college in 2013. As far as that group is concerned, this is really good advice. I totally agree with his three untruths--your feelings are not necessarily true, the world is not good and evil, and adversity does not make you weak. I also agree that children need lots of free play and that social media is bad for kids and they are over-protected. There is nothing to disagree with here (even though I sometimes chafe at ""when we were kids..."" arguments)HOWEVER, using this group's specific problems, the authors make vast over-generalizations. The few anecdotes highlighted are meant to be examples of a deeper problem, but to me, they are the sum total of the problem. Left leaning students are behaving very badly toward conservative speakers. At most, there are 10 or so highly publicized events that seem to play on a loop among conservatives and intellectual dark web types. And there are no defenses to these behaviors, but it hardly represents our nation. And they provide no data whatsoever that it does. It's too soon to even tell that the next generation will be like this one.And for people who seem to care a lot about both sides arguments, they seem to leave out a lot of counter-examples. Here are a few: 1. They talk about the metoo movement once in the beginning. Is that not a product of this ""call out"" generation? None of us ""old"" women had the ""balls"" to speak truth to power like these young women do. Good for them.2. And the Parkland teens and all the ways in which this generation is more compassionate and engaged than we were. My generation (I'm 40) thought it was cool not to care about anything. My middle school kid stays up after school making protest signs and watching political debates. Is that not progress?3. The authors also focuses on one particular subset of an entire generation (left-leaning, and mostly women and LGBT or Trans students asking for safe spaces). They leave out that Gamergate and the trolls and the alt right are also made up of this generation. Why not talk about them at all? Seriously. They are literally the same age and except for one aside in the entire book that ""the right does it too"" there are no examples at all of the right doing the thing they are decrying. It seemed like a half-assed ""both sides"" argument without support.4. Do you know how many books I've read written by old people decrying the hippie generation of the 60s (Alan Bloome's Closing of the American Mind is an example)? Bloome was talking about Haidt and Luianoff. Boy do they grow up fast. 5. It makes me sad that more people will read this book than will read books highlighting actual big problems like inequality. The authors give a nod to the fact that inequality should definitely be remedied, but they would rather you do it the right way and not call it ""social justice."" Again, I agree with all the parenting advice and the cognitive behavior advice, but this is not a self-help book. It's meant as a polemic and it strikes at the wrong target."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24035606-ryan-boissonneault,Rating 5 out of 5,"Imagine that you want to start a fitness program to increase your strength and endurance and sign up at the local gym. Upon arrival, you notice that management has removed all of the weights, concerned that heavy weights can cause stress and injury. Instead, you are instructed to perform light body-weight exercises that you can already safely handle. As you go through the motions of exercise, progress is nonexistent and you’ll be entirely unprepared for any activities that might require greater strength and endurance. Welcome to (some) modern universities, which engage in the intellectual equivalent of removing the weights from the gym by creating safe spaces, disinviting speakers, removing offensive material, and inhibiting free speech and inquiry that should be the staple of a college education. Attending a university with these policies to prepare for the challenges of the outside world is like training for a marathon in our weightless gym. The analogy is apt because the human mind, like the musculoskeletal system, is antifragile. Whereas fragile systems break under pressure and resilient systems can withstand pressure without change, antifragile systems become stronger under pressure. If you want to enhance your physical strength, you have to lift progressively heavier weight; if you want to enhance your intellectual fortitude, you have to expose yourself to different and sometimes controversial or offensive ideas. This is the topic Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt tackle in The Coddling of the American Mind. They frame the issue around the “three great untruths” that are promoted on some campuses across the US, which are creating an environment that not only blocks open inquiry and learning but that leads to polarization, emotional immaturity, fragility, violence, and mental illness. The three untruths are 1) what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker, 2) always trust your feelings, and 3) life is a battle between good people and evil people. These three untruths, taken together, create a student body that is unreceptive to other viewpoints, dogmatic, easily offended, and self-righteous, eager to earn points within the group by calling out and ostracizing those with different views. The great untruths are damaging both socially and psychologically, and run counter to both the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (used to treat anxiety and depression) and ancient wisdom regarding well-being and happiness. The great untruths therefore lead to the types of mental habits that our best therapy aims to eradicate, such as catastrophizing, emotional reasoning, overgeneralizing, dichotomous thinking, labeling, blaming, and negative filtering. Universities are encouraging, in other words, the very habits that lead to anxiety and depression and emotional stunting. The authors dive deeply into these issues in the first two parts of the book and then describe the historical, social, psychological, and political reasons why we find ourselves in this situation. The fourth and final part of the book offers solutions, which I would summarize as follows. The problems on campus can ultimately be solved by focusing on developing the virtues of intellectual courage, humility, and emotional resilience in our children and students. First, intellectual humility forces one to recognize that humans are fallible and prone to bias and error, both individually and collectively. Since we are often blind to our own errors, the only possibility of correcting our misjudgments is through exposure to competing ideas. As the authors put it, exposure to someone that disagrees with you is a gift. They can either change your mind, thus correcting your errors and biases, or else strengthen your own beliefs in the process of defending them. The second virtue, intellectual courage, is the habit of pursuing the truth wherever it may lead and embracing the values of free speech and open inquiry. It’s the recognition that you may be wrong, that you may not have all of the answers, and that the development of your intellect depends on defending your ideas against competing views rather than shutting them down through force or violence. The third virtue, emotional resilience, is the habit of handling adversity appropriately and taking control of your own emotions and reactions. Words are not violence, and being offended does not count as a point or an argument. This reminds me of three quotes by Christopher Hitchens that captures the spirit:— “If someone tells me that I've hurt their feelings, I say, 'I'm still waiting to hear what your point is.’”— “In this country, I've been told, 'That's offensive' as if those two words constitute an argument or a comment.”— “Those who are determined to be ‘offended’ will discover a provocation somewhere. We cannot possibly adjust enough to please the fanatics, and it is degrading to make the attempt.”The best defense against false or immoral ideas is rigorous intellectual debate and criticism, and the censorship of ideas only makes those ideas more appealing to your opponents and to those who are never exposed to the proper criticisms. Shouting down a speaker is immature and intellectually and emotionally cowardly and has no place within a university. If you want to call yourself a liberal, you should have no problem winning the war of words with religious fundamentalists or racists without having to suppress their speech. Sticking with the Christopher Hitchens theme, can you imagine if, instead of engaging in dozens of debates with religious conservatives, he instead called for their speech to be suppressed? How much weaker and ineffective would his position have been? As the authors point out, this is not happening at every university, and there is some debate as to whether or not this is as big of problem as it appears. In fact, it might not be; but it’s important to get out in front of the issue before it becomes a bigger problem. The authors cite some fairly egregious examples from a handful of universities, but also note that there are many exceptions. In particular, the University of Chicago remains a leader in free speech and inquiry and published the Chicago Statement on Principles of Free Expression, which every college student and parent should read. Over 40 institutions have adopted this policy, and hopefully more will follow suit."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may,Rating 2 out of 5,"I saw Jonathan Haidt speak on Real Time and he seemed like an intelligent guy with a lot of interesting ideas, so I patiently waited for this book to become available at my library. I'm also curious about this notion of kids being overprotected or ""coddled"". It's looking more and more like the developed world's need to protect its kids, wrap them in bubble wrap, and disinfect everything might be the cause of a variety of unsavoury things, from Berkeley banning speakers to the rise in childhood leukemia. I don't necessarily agree with all the authors' ideas - such as their thinly-veiled disdain for feminists who talk about rape culture - but I do think they make some important points.The truth is, though, this essay-turned-book should really have just stayed an essay. The authors' three Great Untruths make a thoughtful opinion piece, but there's not a full-length book hidden in the idea. The result of them trying to extend their commentary to a modest 269 pages is a lot of repetition, weak graphs that demonstrate a very small number of people doing a very small number of things, and odd tangents. An example of this latter is the lengthy instruction in how to do Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.A lot of the ""evidence"" is anecdotal, and focuses on a few extreme cases. Perhaps these are indicative of a larger trend, but I don't see anything in this book to convince me of that. I guess I should have just read the article this book grew out of.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"

LOL! Update 2/7/22:An angry mob of white supremacists breaking into the nation's capitol, beating police officers, making off with government property and intending to overthrow democracy are just engaging in ""political discourse."" Hows that for concept creep? LOL! Update 1/15/22:I. Rest. My. Case.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilo91...But she was just exercising her first-amendment right and shouldn't face any serious consequences for her antics, right?  This is a shining example of what we should want , something other than what universities are  supposedly pushing, right? This is a figure emblematic of what the next generation could become if only institutions of higher learning would quit ""indoctrinating"" the youth, right?The truth is that this child is exactly why we need CRT in schools and why consequence-free speech is such a terrible idea.More importantly, this is not a ""rare"" example of ""genuine"" white supremacy but a prime example of what happens when we tolerate intolerance and tacitly put the stamp of approval on white supremacy by admitting such ideas to the clubhouse for valid ideas worth considering.And of course, Haidt and his supporters would argue that the brown children taking their own lives because they can't handle being bombarded with this kind of behavior in school were A, poorly prepared for life and B, need to toughen up and accept that white supremacist ideas are valid and deserve to be heard and respected.  Update 5/14/21:Haidt and his supporters, your thoughts?https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/ne...Is this how we enoculate people against the emotional and intellectual weakness that results from a ""coddled"" mind?Are educators and supervisors supposed to stand by as students and employees exercise their first-amendment right to behave like the republican representative discussed in the above article?Update 4/30/21:Haidt and his supporters, your thoughts?https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/3-n... I guess these officers are victims of woke snowflakes canceling people for exercising their right to free speech, amirite?Then there's this: https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/n...Who, exactly, would be coddled in this instance?Could it be the folks whose ancestors owned people?Could it be the folks who would like to either own or deport people?Teaching anti-racism and creating safe spaces for marginalized groups is dangerous, but teaching folks the ""good of slavery""is a necessary lesson for children?this is why most people believe that one of the two major political parties in this country is a warm and safe space for white supremacists.And then there's this gem:https://www.eurocanadian.ca/2020/06/b...And the comments are what Haidt and his supporters would like students of color to be hit with in a classroom setting.But here's something that explains all of this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI54Y...And Here's something I especially love:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAvQu...How's that for free speech?1/18/21 Edit 1/6/21https://www.businessinsider.com/hate-... I rest my case. These folks and the subject of the video linked below are who proponents of this book and the ""injured party"" they work to defend want to admit to discourse communities. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0V7X...Poor QAnon conspiracy theorists; they're being canceled and silenced by powermad snowflakes who want to deny their right to perpetuate ridiculous narratives about baby-eating, child raping lizard people who worship Satan and want to take over the world.Shame on America's universities for preventing today's youth from being swayed by a cult who has infiltrated and been part of a plot to overthrow the United States government.It is just patently unfair that feminist and anti-racist messages are being treated as normal, intelligent and moral while equally valid beliefs about child sex rings and human sacrifices and a need to protect the Christian white majority are being drummed out of socioacademic discourse./Sarcasm. ********A note to prospective trolls: do not try me.	In case the rating and tags aren’t abundantly clear, this is a *negative* review.	If you slither in here with partisan kvetches about “triggered ““lefties” heaping criticism on poor, picked on bigotry apologists, you will be eviscerated, deleted and blocked. No exceptions.	I’m under no obligation to be polite when I heave assholes out of my house and I’ve no inclination to do so here.	Wanna make a case for/extoll the virtues of bigots? Pen your own review or hold a political rally in a friend’s review space. 	I’m not here for your counter argumentative analyses or your pitiful, presumptuous attempts to change my opinion on this dreck.I'm alright with my interpretation of Haidt's arguments and don't really care if you aren't.	 so, do yourself a favor and find other, more receptive audiences for your “opposing views”; expressing them here is nothing short of boorish and creepy.	Finally, if you are unable to distinguish polite disagreement with a review(hint: this is always welcome here) from trollery (eliminated on sight), it might behoove you to figure out the distinction before commenting.  *************	Holocaust denial, lynching/rape /domestic violence apologia, fundamentalist arguments for misogyny/ the execution of the LGBTQIA population and other flavors of bigotry ought not to be admitted to the clubhouse for ideas worth considering.	More often than not, the folks fighting for such a thing are privileged snowflakes who are themselves triggered by the presence of people from marginalized groups at their university.	They hold repugnant views about some of their classmates/students and want to regain control of a terrifying reality (Oh nos, teh women’s, teh gays, and teh brown people are invading academia, calling us out and threatening our place atop the sociocultural hierarchy!), one in which their deeply entrenched ideas aren't accepted as universal truths.	The authors and their acolytes are being disingenuous when they claim that the exposure of young people to simple disagreement is the goal.	Ostensibly, they aim to inoculate current and future generations against the deleterious effects of echo-chambers	What they really want is to be back in control of discourse communities and to be treated with the deference they think their ethnicity, faith, and socioeconomic status affords them. Simply put, they are advocating for the validation of the following sentiments:•“For everything that is wrong with this world there is a j** behind it.”•“I love laying in bed and rubbing my wet pussy to officers killing n***** men.”•“N***** lives don’t matter.”•“AIDS kills f*** dead.”•“THIS ISN’T OVER YET – NEVER BET AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP! WE ARE MANY – WE ARE MIGHTY WE ARE ARMED – WE ARE UNITED WE ARE TRUMP PATRIOTS – AND WE ARE PISSED! #SayYourPrayersDemocrats #MayGodHaveMercyOnYourSoulBecauseWeWont”•“Let’s see them try to enter the people house and attempt to remove our President, a National Treasure!!! Death will become them!”•“This woman is Evil Incarnate. We Cannot Allow This Satanic Shill To Enter Office. (Kamala Harris’ eyes turn completely black several times during this interview, she is full of unclean spirits ECHO THIS PLEASE)”•“Voting will not remove them. The only things n****** understand are pain and fear”•“IN WAR, IT’S KILL OR BE KILLED. WE NEED 50 MILLION ARMED AMERICAN PATRIOTS TO STORM DC AND KILL ALL THE SWAMP CRIMINALS NOW!!!!!!!!!!"" (Parlor). Most of the sentiments quoted above were uttered by average Americans and manifested in the form of an armed insurrection that, if successful, would have brought an end to American democracy. But hate-speech is free-speech, amirite?These are decidedly non-coddled minds on bigotry and hatred. Any questions?My takeaway? Waaaah!!!; we don't get to be publicly racist, sexist, homophobic or transphobic with impunity anymore! Waaaaah, students outside the bubble of privilege are exercising their first amendment rights to speak out against antifeminist, pro- lynching, social Darwinist religious fundamentalists who want ""safe spaces"" at their institutions of higher learning! Waaaaaa; marginalized groups I hate and with whom I disagree are being heard and taken seriously!Waaaa!!; fewer and fewer people are buying into the socially constructed idea that one permutation of subjectivity is inherently superior to all others.Waaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!; students and teachers (and of course, the lurkers support them in email and in department meetings. LOL!) with toxic and ignorant opinions about entire groups of people continue to conflate free speech with consequence free speech and are shocked and “confused” when they get dragged by the public and made to face professional consequences!	Are some children overprotected? Yes. I agree that this may be a huge problem. In fact, one of the things I appreciate is that my parents never prohibited me from watching horror films or reading violent or ""controversial"" books; E C comics were my favorite.	I especially loved the Judy Bloom books, as she neither sugar coated life’s tribulations nor talked down to her readers.	I also got to run around outside and fight, fall and skin my elbows and knees and wear shorts; no one forced me to sit in the house like “a little lady” and play with plastic emblems of upper-class Western beauty.There were clear rules for play, rules designed to keep my name out of the hat stuffed with those who weren't so lucky. If the chance of a child ending up like Elizabeth Smart, Polly Klaas, Jaycee Dugard or Gina DeJesus is more than zero, why take the risk, particularly if you are in an economically disadvantaged neighborhood and belong to an ethnic group whose children often get ignored by the media when they are victims of crime. Those outside the bubble of privilege know all too well how cops and media regard little brown skinned children who go missing.To continue, should we allow our feelings to take the lead, absolutely not. This is why I abhor those who apply their “feelings” about entire groups of people when making decisions about who deserves to be hired, protected, respected and regarded as human.	And yes, there are ideas and social, political, economic and academic phenomena that are flat out evil. Full stop. The architects and benificiaries of said ideas and phenomena need to wear the shoes they made, no matter how uncomfortable the fit. This is equally true of those who support and facilitate them. 	And I’d like to know how being pummeled with ableist, racist, xenophobic, transphobic, homophobic, religiously intolerant or misogynist vitriol in a classroom setting is supposed to prepare already marginalized people for the real world. Being othered and ostracized *is* their real world, and unlike the more fortunate subjectivities, they didn’t get a preparation period.But maybe the concern isn't so much for *those* groups as it is for straight, white, able-bodied CIS gendered students who might learn to question notions of their inherent superiority. Perhaps that's where the moral panic that underlies this book comes from.	All in all, this is a terrified,defensive and embarrasingly reductive argument for a return to the days when harmful behaviors and the repugnant, taken for granted attitudes from which they sprang were “just the way it was.”"
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155663-david-rubenstein,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a fascinating but very disturbing book about how college students have recently been caught in the three great untruths. The first untruth is that one's feelings are the best guide to correctness. The second is that one should avoid pain or discomfort; what doesn't kill you makes you weaker. And the third untruth is that one should find fault in others, and not in one's self.This book is not about helicopter parents, although they certainly contribute. It is about a new culture of safety-ism. In this culture, one should always seek safety, even emotional safety. If someone says something to you that makes you uncomfortable, then what he says is unsettling, harmful, and the person who said it is evil. Each person is either good or evil, and there is no middle ground. And, if someone says anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or stressed, then that person is evil.From time to time, we hear about college students who protest speakers who have been invited to give talks on unsettling subjects, or who have unpopular viewpoints. The college administration is then pressured to retract the invitation, even though the speech is bound to be a learning experience for all. Sometimes a faculty member tries to help a student, is sincere and respectful, but a student takes the attempt the wrong way. The student raises a big stink, characterizes the instructor as harmful and therefore evil. Other faculty members secretly agree with the instructor, but are scared of voicing their dissenting opinions. The college administration is cowed into placating the students, and is not true to the mission of a college.What is the purpose of a college? While some would argue that a college's purpose is to teach skills, an equally important purpose is to prepare students for their post-college life. After college, people are exposed to all sorts of viewpoints, including both good and obnoxious points of view. An important purpose of a college is to inoculate its students, to make them stronger for the future. The best way to do that is to expose students to differing points of view, even unsettling ideas, so that students can become more critical thinkers and not over-stressed by people of other persuasions.Many years ago I went to a public university, and heard invited speakers give talks that were very controversial. Students who didn't want to hear these speakers always had the option not to attend. They did not protest against the speakers, depriving others of a learning opportunity. It was that simple.This book takes the reader on a journey through recent events on college campuses. These events are extremely disturbing, and made me sick that today's students, teachers, parents, and college administrators are often so weak-minded. They have lost their way, and forgotten that while physical safety is absolutely important, emotional safety is not necessarily bad for one's health. But now I have a better understanding of what is happening in college campuses today.I didn't read this book--I listened to the audiobook, which is narrated by one of the authors, Jonathan Haidt. He is an exception to the rule--Haidt is an amazingly good reader, and I truly enjoyed listening to his narration."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23195904-radiantflux,Rating 2 out of 5,"97th book for 2018.This again seems like a good article that got bloated unnecessarily into a book. There are some good points about the necessity to develop resilience in children, but with little strong substance to back things up. The arguments seem one-sided and cherry-picked. Reading this book you'd think that snowflake liberal children are rioting on every campus in America. Also the focus of the book is a bit unclear to me: is it a critique of the commercialization of the university system in America, where students have become consumers, or is it a critique of current child rearing practices in the USA? Mostly it seems to be a criticism of a few selectively picked incidents that have occurred over the last year in the America, without giving any credence or context to the aggressive culture wars occurring throughout the USA at this moment. Two-stars."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3536004-jenna,Rating 4 out of 5,"Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think."" ~Hanna GrayI'm not sure how to begin this review other than to say it was both interesting and disturbing. Having read iGen: Why Today’s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy--and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood--and What That Means for the Rest of Us, I was somewhat aware of what is taking place in universities across the US. The authors of ""The Coddling of American Minds write a similar book but giving many more examples of the erosion of free speech on campuses. I'm flabbergasted! How can universities, the very places where freedom of speech was most protected, now be censoring both professors and students in order to not offend anyone? In order to not ""harm"" students with ideas? Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt explain why this is taking place, how we have turned into a culture of fragility and over-protection. It is one thing to not allow hate speech, hateful and truly harmful ideas, as the authors are quick to point out, but quite another to suppress any view that might go against what students believe, in order to not ""harm"" them by exposing them to alternate points of view. Why are universities firing professors for bringing up ""hot"" issues? Why are they banning controversial speakers? Why are they limiting what even the students can say? It all starts with over-parenting and treating children as fragile things that cannot withstand anything. Of course, this comes from a good place -- a good parent does not want their child to be hurt and wants to protect them from all harm. I'm not a parent but I can understand that. We don't want those we love to be hurt or suffer. However, we as society have gone too far, from ""protecting"" our children from peanuts and thus greatly increasing the number of children with deadly allergies to them, to protecting them from alternate views and conflicting ideas. We don't allow children to grow if we keep them from being exposed to things that challenge them. The authors say that children are not fragile, but anti-fragile. We need to protect them from serious harm of course, but by coddling them and treating even teens as young children, we are hurting their future prospects and making it more difficult for them to succeed in the adult world. The authors cite numerous examples of this overprotection, both of young children and extending onto college campuses. They list 3 Untruths that now often govern how children are raised and are causing them to be more anxious and depressed than previous generations:•The Untruth of Fragility: ""What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.""•The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: ""Always trust your feelings.""•The Untruth of Us Versus Them: ""Life is a battle between good people and evil people.""  The 3 criteria for an idea to be classified as an Untruth are:•""It contradicts ancient wisdom.""•""It contradicts modern psychological research on well-being.""•It harms the individuals and communities who embrace it.""I will not expand on these in my review but highly recommend the book for any who is interested. I would like to say though, that I do not wholly agree with the first criteria, that of something being untrue in part because it contradicts ancient wisdom. I would argue that just because something has always been held ""true"" doesn't mean it is. In fact, just because something has always been held true is reason in itself to challenge the assumption. Society would make no progress if ""truths' were never questioned, and each generation merely accepted what the prior ones said. We would still be burning people at the stake, still be stoning people to death for adultery, still be cutting off hands for the theft of bread, still be enslaving people (well, we are in a way, if you look at the prison industry in the US, but that's for another discussion), still be locking up gay people. Sometimes we NEED to contradict ancient wisdom. That said, I mostly agree with this book and the assertions put forth by the authors. I think there is a fine line at times between hate speech and free speech and I'm still not sure where the line needs to be drawn. Drawn it must be; people must be protected from those who would harm them and incite violence against them. However, people do not need to be protected from merely hearing differing points of view, ie a young person who is taught creationism at home is not emotionally harmed by learning about evolution in a school setting (where facts are supposed to be taught).As was pointed out to me by a reader of my original (flawed and perhaps somewhat racist or at least racially insensitive) review, ""There is a very important distinction between thinking differently and holding a position that is objectively wrong"". This is true and this is where the line needs to be drawn. And it needs to be drawn by those at whom hateful and false ideologies are directed and who are thus affected by, not by those who are not. The majority cannot dictate what is allowed to be taken as harmful to the minority.Objectively false ideas do not need to be entertained, nor should they be. When it comes to mere differences of opinion though, I love the following advice from the book:
""Argue as if you're right, but listen as if you're wrong (and be willing to change your mind). Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person's perspective. Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you've learned from them.""

7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,Rating 5 out of 5,"When picking up this book, I had the distinct impression that I MIGHT be getting into a polemical debate with some sort of bias beginning to scream at Lefts or Rights... but that's the funny thing.This book argues AGAINST triggers. Against going with your knee-jerk reactions. Against Safetyism.A culture of safety is NOT the same thing as providing a safe physical environment. It should be obvious, but often is not, that having seatbelts in cars is not the same thing as students shouting down speakers on campus, issuing rape and death threats for people speaking of ANYTHING that they don't agree with, or equating social justice with REAL justice.Stopping the KKK and lynchings is Justice. Making a school administrator fear for their lives because they misused a pronoun, or turning the misuse of a specific pronoun into something as nasty as actual physical molestation IS NOT JUSTICE.And yet, people everywhere (and I mean, EVERYWHERE) are getting more and more scared of doxing, public shaming, and anonymous trolling campaigns. It has become an accepted practice to turn anyone of a different ideology into targets of ridicule and slander until both sides have no idea what the hell is going on.What is truth? What happened to the search for truth ANYWHERE? They sum up the book in three main points. 1. We've forgotten the adage of ""What doesn't kill you will make you stronger."" If someone insults you, you ought to ADAPT. If someone betrays you, ADAPT. And yet, increasingly, we're all climbing into our safe ideological niches, surrounding ourselves with ONLY those things we think we can cope with, until nothing else remains except a narrow, narrow worldview. Open up your minds. Broaden your horizons. You don't have to agree with everyone or even anyone, but the experience WILL enrich you.2. Following your feelings is often really, really stupid. We have minds and we must always combat our own biases every single day. Remember when you fussed about a food when you were a kid and then you realized, later, that you loved it? If we always did what our feelings said, (especially for those of us who suffer from depression,) then our suicide rates might jump higher than the death rates of cancer. Oh, and let's not forget... following our feelings when surrounded by a bunch of other fearful and angry people has another term associated with it:MOBS. And we all know that no one is as stupid as all of us together.3. Oh, and we must always look for fault in others. We're never wrong. It's always someone else that has done this to us. This way of thinking could NEVER backfire, of course. Unfortunately, the first two points described above are exacerbating everyone's mental health issues. And let's face it... we have TONS. Rates of murder and violence and abductions are as low as they were in the 60's and yet everyone is growing up coddled and fearful and crazy. We've lost natural socialization, not only in the physical sense (scheduled playdates versus running around and getting into and out of trouble), but also in the amount of screentime we're ALL getting. Children are maturing much, much slower than at any other time and they're unable to cope with the real world. Hell, most of us are.We all need to open up our minds to listen as if we're wrong even while we argue passionately as if we're right.The point is... TRUTH is getting lost in mob mentality. We all need to wake up and get courageous and stand up for our beliefs while simultaneously RETAINING AN OPEN MIND.Otherwise, unofficially, our vaunted love of free speech is now DEAD."

Towards the end of the book, I wanted to shoot myself everytime I read the word ""saftyism."" The book started out as an article, which explains a lot. It should've stayed an article.Also, the Authors fail to provide compelling evidence in support of their hypothesis that we are facing a generational crisis. They largely backup their sweeping generalizations about ""I-Gen"" with extreme anecdotal cases. The section on mental health included a lot of good data, but that was the exception.Lastly, this book (like many others) seems to be confused about whether it's descriptive or prescriptive in nature. Sure, it can both, but there was a confusing blend of the two that made it feel awkward. For example, there are sections with highly detailed instructions on how to practice CBT which seemed completely out of place given the general thrust of the book."

Its insights into the various developments over the past couple generations(parenting, social media, identity politics) weave a fascinating (if often dispiriting) and comprehensive picture of how we got to the current political climate, particularly on campus. The book is challenging in many respects, while remaining accessible and engaging. I’ll be thinking about it for a long time to come, and hope others will, too."

I wasn’t aware, however, until reading Greg Lukianoff and Jonathon Haidt’s book “The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas are Setting Up a Generation for Failure”, how things have changed so terribly.If you’ve followed the news at all in the past couple years, you’ll get a sense of how fucked up things are, but the media doesn’t always capture the whole story, and in today’s politically divisive atmosphere, the media is going to skew facts depending on where one stands, politically: those on the left see its significance overblown and exaggerated by the right, while those on the right see it as a sign of the apocalypse. The truth is, as always, somewhere in the middle.But things are really bad, and Lukianoff/Haidt have spent nearly a decade rigorously studying the whys and wherefores and hows of the whole mess. Their conclusion? Well-intentioned but nevertheless bad parenting, coupled with the rise of social media and roughly three extremely awful ideas that seemed to have permeated our culture as a whole, have created the perfect storm of an overprotected, anxious, depressed, and fragile generation of kids who can’t do anything.Lukianoff/Haidt can pretty much pinpoint exactly when things started going to shit. The year 2013; which is the year when kids born in 1995 started going to college. These kids, known as the iGen (anyone born in 1995 and beyond, during the years in which the Internet basically exploded in popularity), were a generation of kids who have, for the most part, been coddled and protected by smothering, overprotective “helicopter” parents. These are kids who, for the most part, spent most of their childhood indoors in front of a computer screen rather than socializing with other kids the old-fashioned way: outdoors and completely unsupervised, like those of us who grew up in the ‘60s, ‘70s, and ‘80s.For some reason, parents of the iGen instilled in their kids the sense that they were fragile creatures who could be easily hurt, maimed, or killed by anything that made them uncomfortable or frightened. Whether it was walking home from school, going to the mall with friends, watching zombie movies, or listening to speakers who espoused ideas that threatened to jostle their set religious and political beliefs, these kids learned that taking risks and being challenged was a bad thing. Herein lies the first of the three Great Untruths that Lukianoff/Haidt refer to as one of the underlying reasons that kids are the way they are:
The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.
Clearly, this is a reworking of Friedrich Nietzche’s famous aphorism, “What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger”, which is basically a common theme in most classic literature and philosophy. It is the idea that in suffering and adversity one gain’s an appreciation for life and true consciousness. Seriously, everyone from Fyodor Dostoyevsky to Sigmund Freud has alluded to this idea.Yet, somewhere, somehow, in the late-20th century and early-21st century, this idea got flipped on its head.Lukianoff/Haidt believe that it started out with the best intentions. Parents want their kids to be safe. There’s nothing wrong with that, but when parents started going overboard and sheltering kids from everything out of a misguided belief that keeping kids away from things that could potentially cause injury (physical as well as mental), they were unknowingly creating paranoia and crippling anxiety in their kids.Protecting kids from dangerous objects is one thing. Protecting them from dangerous ideas goes against everything most psychologists and scientists would deem a healthy upbringing: “A culture that allows the concept of “safety” to creep so far that it equates emotional discomfort with physical danger is a culture that encourages people to systematically protect one another from the very experiences embedded in daily life that they need in order to become strong and healthy. (p. 29)” This culture of “Safetyism” that has evolved as a result is what has contributed to college campuses in which students have protested professors, speakers, and other students for saying things that they not only deem “offensive” but also “damaging” to their worldview and belief systems. Conservatives have cruelly dubbed these kids “snowflakes”, but it is simply a natural byproduct of what Lukianoff/Haidt refer to as the second Great Untruth.
The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always Trust Your Feelings.
We’re probably all guilty of spreading this one. Some of the blame can be handed to our collective national reactions to 9/11, in which it became an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to report anything suspicious, regardless of how trivial. “See Something, Say Something” was a popular ad campaign in the years immediately subsequent to September 11, 2001.There is something to be said for listening to one’s inner voice sometimes. If you get a bad vibe from your weird uncle or that older kid down the street that’s always trying to lure kids into his house with candy, maybe you should listen to those feelings.Unfortunately, some kids have taken this approach way too far, to the point that anyone who says anything that is deemed “offensive” (a rather subjective label), intentionally or not, is an awful bigoted person who has committed a crime against their person. Needless to say, this does not cultivate a healthy learning environment.This is why the incidents of “disinviting” guest speakers to college campuses has risen in the past few years. It’s why the UC Berkley campus---a college once known as a bastion of free speech---recently erupted in violence by protestors who refused to let guest speakers speak.It goes against everything that a free speech advocate believes in, and the irony is that these students believed that they were protesting in the name of “tolerance”.It also goes against the very idea of education, as expressed by Hanna Holborn Gray: “Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make people think. (p. 51)”Unfortunately, in this toxic atmosphere of political divisions and bitterness, the third Great Untruth rears its head.
The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a Battle Between Good People and Evil People. 
Life isn’t simple, or black and white. There’s a lot of grey areas that can be confusing and uncomfortable to deal with.One of the toughest grey areas to grasp is the idea that no one is completely good or evil, that we are all split down the middle. Unfortunately, an entire generation has apparently grown up to believe the opposite: that there are good people (us) who must constantly, vigilantly, stand up to the forces of evil people (them). In the nineteenth-century, Karl Marx simplified the dichotomy of man by separating people into the bourgeoisie (the capitalists, or rich people) vs. the proletariat (the workers). Today, the split has morphed into liberals versus conservatives, or the Left vs. the Right. There used to be a time when the Left and the Right simply disagreed on issues but managed to remain civil, knowing that neither side was necessarily right or wrong, good or evil, just different. This has changed, especially in the minds of young people. Today, most college students (a vast majority of which tend to lean left) view those on the Right as an enemy; a particularly evil one, too. College campuses, which are predominantly liberal, have made it very difficult for conservatives. Conservative professors have seen a rise in administrations chastising or firing them for seemingly innocuous slights, more often than not interpreted as offenses against a student or students.This has resulted in a stressful “walking on eggshells” by conservatives in an attempt to not garner the wrath of liberal students. It has become so bad that many conservative professors simply remove parts of their curricula that they think students will find “offensive” or simply quit. Neither option is conducive to a healthy learning environment. 
A Simple Fix
Lukianoff/Haidt don’t just examine the problem. They even offer solutions, some of which are so common sense that it is frightening that most parents, teachers, and college administrators haven’t already enacted them. Unfortunately, therein lies part of the problem.While it’s easy to make fun of or even feel pity for these college kids, it’s not always easy to assess blame, especially when the blame rests on all of us: parents, teachers, college administrators, politicians, scientists. Everyone has helped to perpetuate the untruths mentioned here, so it is up to us to recognize what we’ve done wrong and correct it.One way to do that is read this book. Seriously, this book should be required reading for every parent today."

For the most part, many of these young men and women are developmentally challenged in several ways. Their stunted growth is the result of their parent’s upbringing; the students have been coddled by their parents, trained to fear anyone outside of their immediate circles, prohibited from engaging in creative thinking, stopped from normal play activities, subjected to increased study activities following a typical school day (even at the kindergarten level), denied opportunities to explore their neighborhoods without adult supervision (lest they are kidnapped), and the list goes on. The authors explore the negative impact of obsessive “screen time” (I-phones, computers, etc.) use and the pitfalls of social media where (especially girls) are instantly judged and scored. All of these factors have to lead to record increases in reported cases of high anxiety, depression, impatience, intolerance, fragility, and a willingness to harshly judge others who they unreasonably deem to be threatening. These so-called “I-gen” teenagers formulate a culture where it is a “us against them” mentality—there is no middle ground. Speakers at their colleges who express ideologies different from these students are attacked and forced off of college campuses. Members of their group are “called out” and shunned if they deviate from the perspectives of the group. Even liberal professors who write or say something that even slightly hints at a philosophy different from the group are attacked. Administrators often take the coddled students to side out of fear—indeed, some college officials regard students as customers and design cushy and exotic surroundings for students—colleges are in the money business—officials also live in constant fear of lawsuits. Authors Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt write a book that defines the issues and problems of the I-gen and offer possible solutions. Great book."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,Rating 4 out of 5,"Summary: Discusses three bad ideas that result in a culture of ""safetyism"" in higher education, chronicles the consequences of these bad ideas, traces factors that led to the embrace of these ideas, and how we might choose a wiser way.1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt contend that these three bad ideas constitute a well-intentioned but toxic basis for a campus culture of ""safetyism."" They argue that these ideas contradict ancient wisdom, psychological research on well-being, and are harmful to the individuals and communities who embrace this mindset. Lukianoff, the president of FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) and Haidt, a social psychologist perhaps best known for his recent work, The Righteous Mind, began to notice, from 2013 on, an increasing trend of concern on university campuses about ""triggering material,"" efforts to disinvite, or obstruct controversial speakers by heckling or even violence, coupled with reports of increasing levels of anxiety and fears about safety.There seemed to be an increasing perception by university administrators that students were ""fragile"" and needed protection and ""safe spaces."" They noted the priority given to feelings, and that the response to anything that evokes negative emotions is not to consider how one ought think about the external cause, but to simply remove whatever offends or causes stress--be it course material or offensive speakers, or perceived ""microaggressions."" They also noted the framing of the world in terms of a toxic form of identity politics, focused on common enemies rather than common humanity--us versus them, good versus evil.After delineating the contours and problems with these ""three great untruths,"" the authors chronicle a number of incidents in the last five years that they believe result from these often well-intentioned but bad ideas. They chronicle violent outcomes to this thinking at Berkeley after Milo Yiannopoulos was invited to speak with no disciplinary action by the university, and at Middlebury College when controversial scholar Charles Murray attempted to speak and a hosting faculty member suffered a concussion and whiplash requiring six months of physical therapy, in attempts to disrupt the event. Perhaps not as well publicized were the ""witch hunts,"" often against liberal faculty like Erika Christakis at Yale, who objected to an administration's paternalistic instructions about offensive Halloween costumes, suggesting that students might be mature enough to set their own norms. Students called her out as a racist, for creating an unsafe space, and sought her firing. She ultimately resigned. On many campuses, faculty feel they are walking on egg shells, often choosing to avoid anything controversial for fear that it may evoke complaints, or a witch hunt.The authors identify six contributing factors to this culture of safetyism, devoting a chapter to each:1. Rising political polarization, with campuses shifting leftward and increasingly distrusted by those on the right.2. An increase in adolescent anxiety and depression beginning in 2011, significantly correlating to smartphone usage. This group began arriving on campus in 2013.3. Paranoid parenting resulting in far less unsupervised play and greater fears of abduction (even though crime rates for this crime have dropped).4. The decline of free play and the rise of emphasis on test preparation.5. The growth of a bureaucracy of safetyism at universities, driven by federal mandates, risks of lawsuits, and a consumerist mentality, in which students are the consumers.6. The quest for justice, evoked by events between 2012 and 2018 that sometimes focuses on ""equal outcomes social justice"" in which any demographic disparity is assumed to be the result of discrimination, and alternative explanations are themselves considered discriminatory.The authors observe that many of these factors arise from good intentions taken to extremes and are careful to distinguish between legitimate forms of concern (like protecting physical safety) and more extreme forms of safetyism.They conclude with three chapters on wising up, with applications to children, to universities, and to the wider society.  They argue for preparing kids for the road rather than the road for the kids. They propose that our worst enemies cannot harm us as much as our emotional reasoning. And they encourage the recognition that ""the line dividing good and evil goes through the heart of every human being,"" and that we ought be watchful for any institution that promotes a common enemy rather than common humanity narrative. They commend the Chicago Statement (including a version of it in an appendix) that promotes free speech, academic freedom and free inquiry and sanctioning efforts to suppress speech.The authors, particularly Greg Lukianoff, who benefited personally from this approach, advocate for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that improves mental health and coping skills through recognizing cognitive distortions and maladaptive behaviors, and challenging and changing these. Essentially, they would contend that their ""three bad ideas"" are both cognitive distortions and lead to maladaptive behaviors good neither for the person, nor the university, nor society. Hence, it should be understood that CBT is integral to their critique and recommendations.Working in a collegiate setting, I've seen many of the conditions the authors describe. Most faculty I know readily resonate with the feeling that they walk on egg shells, even while being deeply committed to academic freedom and challenging students thinking. I've seen the growing sensitivity to microaggressions. I've witnessed the surprise when I've suggested that being offended is a choice--that no one can offend us unless we let them, and that there are other options. I have been concerned that universities often seem to be echo chambers for the progressive end of our political discourse, blind to the very practices they excoriate on the right.Given the character of our wider society, it seems the last thing universities should be doing is engaging in the kinds of ""coddling"" Lukianoff and Haidt describe. If we are to have any hope, it will take resilient, anti-fragile people who will engage and keep engaging differing and even off-putting ideas. Most of all, in a climate of us versus them, we need people able to follow the Pauli Murray's principle: ""When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them."" Here's to drawing larger circles!"

14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1369203-tim,Rating 4 out of 5,"There are two incidents that stick out as the backbone of this book, that serve as a memorable backdrop illustrating some of the worst aspects of college life in America today. You’ve probably heard of them.In 2017 at Evergreen State College, students rioted, vandalized, threatened, harassed, and bullied their way towards getting policy changes enacted after Professor Bret Weinstein suggested that maybe a planned day where white people are cajoled to stay at home might not be such a great idea.In 2015 at Yale, students had a similar reaction when Professor Erika Christakis had the nerve to suggest that maybe the University shouldn’t enforce rules on what Halloween costumes are offensive, and instead trust students to set norms and make their own decisions.These are the most memorable incidents that illustrate the increasing intolerance of students to hear opposing viewpoints, but there are many others. While I knew of these events, hearing them retold in some detail really brought home (1) just how minor or non-existent the original “offense” was that sparked these incidents, (2) the details of how irrational, angry, aggressive, anti-intellectual, and dishonest the protestors were, and (3) how cowardly the University leadership was in not supporting their Professors who were being harassed and lied about, and not supporting a basic culture of Freedom of Speech and reasoned debate.I think the book is a worthwhile read just to hear these stories.The book was strongest when it kept to “here is what is happening at college campuses”. But the authors were more ambitious. They also talked about:“Why this is bad”. That might seem obvious, but it was worthwhile to spell this out.“Why this is happening”. That is, what is it about youths entering college starting in around 2013 that are different from earlier years? Things like social media and a trend towards more paranoid parenting were discussed. These parts seemed accurate, I guess, but felt tedious to me. This stuff was about half the book. I thought it was more important to just focus on the incidents that illustrate what is happening, as I think many people are either unaware of it or disagree that what is happening is a problem.“What to do about it”. The last section had some recommendations on how to move forward so that college campuses can recapture intellectual vitality and open debate. If everyone agreed on what was happening and that it is in fact a bad thing, people might agree on these suggestions, and they might be helpful. But given that we aren’t there, this section felt unrealistic, though I did like the advice given for parents and students on how to build themselves to be as open-minded and intellectually curious as possible."

All three untruths can be easily heard and observed in various fields of teaching and higher education environments especially. I have observed them to an increased extent even within my Roman Catholic university employer environments. The last untruth about worldview or ideas being either good/evil is becoming so endemic and evident, not only in education, but in the media language of nearly all bents that I myself, I've become discouraged to the true vitality of proper debate or discussion any longer. What role models too? Only role modeling for closed minded and grim / self-satisfied superiority to judgments of ""evil"" seem to have become predominant and visible. Like anything physical, any muscle or system- if it is not used and tested it goes from weak to weaker. Human endurance and strength toward wide avenues of ideas are no different. This book illuminates the 3 tenets of ""safety"" practices. And what has been the results measured and oftentimes observable.Protection and safety are not harbors for growth. This book will illuminate why that is and what can be measured since safety places and identity politics self-identity mantras have dominated environments of ""learning"". This book defines what has happened and what is observable. And what we see in ""reactions"" to attacks on free speech in the last decade. I could not believe the reaction of DePaul University when Ben Shapiro came to do a speech and question/ answer session in Chicago. (They caved to the mob anger reactions and didn't let him or any of his aides set foot on campus with VISIBLE police/ campus security presence to keep him off. He ended up doing the session at an off campus last minute space rental. I saw the Dean tell him that he would be ""arrested"" if he set a foot on the campus. IN AMERICA!!) And how that administration then censored and allowed the terrible behaviors against free speech to continue, even afterwards in physical and property damage tirades- like babies having a tantrum. In the USA, this lack of regard for the 1st Amendment is disgusting. And it hurts the ""protected"" the most. These tantrums are becoming multiple, multiple. Some of them with anarchy destruction and vile garbage affronts as in the Berkeley repeats. Always negating the 1st amendment base American Constitution premise beyond the human ""failure"" of their violent property or assault crimes. Yes, failure will be the result of swallowing those 3 listed untruths. Especially the last one which composites inherently that every one with different ""eyes"" or avenues to address a solution differently than the ""approved"" line is not opposed or different but just ""evil"" on the good/bad scales of ""group think allowances"".Three ideas (fallacies that are also being role modeled as well) that have been woven into our ""protecting"" American minds:1. What doesn't kill you, makes you WEAKER.2. Always trust your feelings.3. Life is a battle between good people and evil people.Safetyism is pitiable, IMHO. Political correctness ""group think"" judgments a major component and a symptom. This book will detail all the social trends in establishing safetyism throughout youth, childhood etc. in various social and community environments, beyond just the bureaucracies of schooling."
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1500718-ryan,Rating 4 out of 5,"Much as I've come to admire Haidt, I'll admit that I was worried to see this title, which seems like a typical ""culture wars"" click bait. How did the book hold up upon reading it?This is a reasonably argued book about extreme incidents on American college campuses and how they relate to the larger culture. The title is bad, however, because it makes the text at first glance combative in a way that I don't associate with Haidt. (I generally view him as persuading from a pretty easily established common ground, such as when he discusses his use of prozac in The Happiness Hypothesis or how he explains in Righteous Mind that he was motivated by Al Gore's defeat in the 2000 American presidential election to study moral psychology.) In my humble opinion, it is easy to see where Haidt is coming from and why he finds his conclusions convincing. That is true here, even if the title is awful.Briefly, the book worries about a culture of ""safetyism."" There are three ""great untruths"" in safetyism, which are: 1) Fragility: what doesn't kill you makes you weaker 2) Emotional reasoning: always trust your feelings and 3) Us vs. Them: life is a battle between good and evil. They also highlight 10 distorted automatic thoughts, which are: mind reading, fortune telling (negatively predicting the future), catastrophic thinking, labelling, discounting the positive, negative filtering, overgeneralizing, dichotomous thinking, shoulds (""I should do well; if I don't, then I'm a failure""), and personalizing blame. The culture of safetyism does not challenge these distorted automatic thoughts, perhaps because it fears that it will make people feel bad about themselves, which sets off the untruths. As much as I distrust ""great"" anythings in social commentary about the present, I don't think it's hard to understand what they're talking about.For anyone who's reluctant to engage with a book that gives off even a whiff of ""culture wars"" discourse, I'll note that there are other interesting ideas here, such ""concept creep."" Haidt and Lukianoff explain that ""trauma"" originally described physical injury. It was then expanded to psychological trauma, but with the caution that psychological trauma happens in response to extreme situations. The unexpected death of one's spouse from a sudden illness would not qualify as traumatic under the second generation definition. However, the third generation definition now is determined by how the person characterizes the emotion. So if the unexpected death of one's spouse feels awful and the bereaved labels it traumatic, by this definition it is traumatic.As much as I'd like to promote Coddling as more than a book about culture wars questions, it does explore how they play out in Gen Z on college campuses. I was familiar with some of the violent protests the book explored, but not all of them. They really are awful, sometimes obnoxious, to read about. Are they typical of the larger culture or does it just feel like it?I was also surprised by Haidt and Lukianoff's history of how right-wing media outlets respond to anything that even vaguely threatens their worldview. At one point, they discuss a professor's theory about ancient statues--that they were not alabaster white originally but only later aged to those colors. In other words, the ancient world has become whiter in historical accounts. Fascinating! What happened when this theory was reported on right-wing news outlets? Threats of rape and death from people near and far. Let's imagine that we might include Coddling as part of a stack. What else might one read? I'd include Haidt's previous book, Righteous Mind, Ronson's So You've Been Publicly Shamed, and Nagle's Kill All Normies. What about Storr's Unpersuadables, a book that explores things that seem ridiculous and twists them until they seem convincing, or at least not ridiculous. (Russell is also quite good at this in his History of Western Philosophy, perhaps because he feels one should understand why people feel they are right before figuring out why they are wrong.) I've since read Saslow's Rising Out of Hatred, which may be one very effective demonstration of how campuses are not inherently dysfunctional. In it, the college population ostracizes a white nationalist, but some students also reach out to him to try to reverse his views. Maybe Haidt is focusing on atypical scenarios.We are not as good at empathy as we think we are, and it's difficult but worthwhile to charitably study views we are skeptical of. It's perhaps worth noting that I only picked up this book, with its click baity title, because I had a reading relationship with Haidt from his previous work. We live within bubbles that we are hardly aware of.*P.S. Since reading this book, I've heard Ezra Klein talk about these issues on his podcast (It's the Ask Ezra episode, somewhere around 3/4s in.) He is also going to have Haidt on the show--update again: it was interesting."

Standing comfortably aside modern intellectual heavyweights such as Jordan Peterson who have critiqued our cultural milieu, I was not the least bit surprised with the message within. However, I was particularly surprised to discover that A: the authors are neither Republicans nor Right-Wing in any fashion (as stated in the book, they’ve voted Democrat their whole lives) and B: That Political Correctness is just one gear in the machine of the world before us.Compounded with Safetyism (which is mind-bogglingly out of place in the safest era in recorded history), For-Profit-Colleges (that want to rope in customers for as long as possible), and a newly mutated ladder in life in which most every aspect of maturity has been delayed, Haidt and Co. have presented a well-rounded picture that is deservingly multi-faceted and complex yet eminently readable and accessible for anyone with an IQ over 90. Given all the source material used, I was pleasantly surprised to read such an enjoyably well written tome that is as pertinent as it is convincing.While I certainly don’t agree with all their politics, conclusions (and even some of the research itself), having found myself working with Millennial peers over the past few years, this book has made me all the more aware of the immense shifts in culture and attitudes that have forged this generation and their values. For the most part, there really is, “nothing new under the sun,” but, for this generation, and the next, a whole host of changes have occurred and will certainly continue to occur and I hope we can have excellent researchers and educators as Haidt and Co. to help us make sense of the complexity before us.Thanks for listening.

The authors examine the root of divisiveness plaguing American society, the increasing inability of individuals of all political persuasions to engage in rational, intelligent, thoughtfully reasoned debate and dialogue. Complicit in this alarming decline are institutions of higher learning embracing emotionalism over critical and analytical thinking, dialectics, and abandoning their sacred obligation to defend academic and intellectual freedom. Equally complicit are parents who smother their children with overprotection to the point that they are emotionally and intellectually infantilized. The consequences of having a generation unable and/or unwilling to engage intellectually and thoughtfully with ideas that make them uncomfortable are profoundly dire for society, opening the door to forms of authoritarianism across the political spectrum."

This book zooms in to highlight these issues in even more accurate detail, in great part due to the fact that it was very recently written and published. Some examples: the blocking of political opponents from speaking publicly, the trending lie that if one feels unsafe one *is* unsafe, and the practice of ""common enemy identity politics"" as opposed to ""common humanity identity politics"". While the authors focus their attention on these issues as they appear on college campuses, I see very similar problems in many areas outside of colleges and outside the usual college age range. If I could recommend one political book for my friends to read this year, it would be this one, regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum. It skewers poor, distorted forms of communication using very recent examples, and offers productive suggestions for how to achieve social justice goals in healthier ways."

However, the authors, lawyer and First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and psychologist Jonathan Haidt, explain in their introduction how it came about that this rather provocative title was chosen, and if you care to read further than the first few words before indulging in the emotional pleasure of feeling offended, you will find that there is a second title, How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure, which at least gives the other side the benefit of the doubt, by assuming they are being motivated by good intentions.The authors are concerned about the change of the intellectual climate on university campuses with the advent of the iGen students, a development which is marked by calls for safe spaces, trigger warnings, demands to disinvite speakers who voice ideas that may challenge certain students‘ beliefs, thereby making them feel uncomfortable, the establishment of a call-out culture and the spread of the ideology of safetyism. The latter is characterized by the creep-down of the word safety, which is no longer restricted to meaning physical safety but also the more vague concept of safety from unsettling feelings, mental discomfort and doubts, or simply from having to face thoughts, ideas and beliefs which one actually opposes. In short, the climate at universities, but also in society as a whole, has become more and more hostile to the free expression of thoughts that are incompatible with mainstream beliefs.Lukianoff and Haidt make out three ideas or modes of thinking which they hold responsible for this change in attitudes and intellectual climate and which, they say, not only endanger free speech and productive academic discussion but also, in the long run, harm those who embrace them in their daily lives. These bad ideas are1)	What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. (The Untruth of Fragility),2)	Always trust your feelings. (The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning),3)	Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (The Untruth of Us vs. Them).I don’t want to explain these three detrimental ways of thinking in this short book review, mainly because you might want to read about them yourself in the book discussed here, but also because anyone who has noticed how indignation and public shaming competetions are run in social but also mainstream media knows in a way how these untruths work and how we are heading more and more towards a . Before I go on talking about this book, using these seemingly bad, bad words, it may be well to say that Lukianoff and Haidt are anything but polemical. Instead, they work upon the academic principle of presenting the arguments of the other side in the best light possible, trying to understand the motivations and intentions that lead to ideas and measures they themselves strongly disagree with. There is sound intellectual honesty and fairness at the bottom of this book, which is, by the way, a good example of how to avoid the third of the above-listed untruths, and which is also a prerequisite for starting a real discussion instead of shouting at and vilifying each other.The authors show how the three untruths work in university life where they start to hamper scientific progress and the exchange of ideas and viewpoints but also make it hard, or even impossible, to really prepare students for life. Then they present the sources from which the three faulty ideas sprang, namely the change of the political and social climate as such (e.g. through the rise of a provocation culture and apodictic thinking on both sides of the political spectrum), the rise of depression and anxiety among adolescents and children, the rise of overprotective parenting and the decline of free, unsupervised play due to a culture of safetyism, a „Cover Your Ass“ bureaucracy in schools and universities, and erroneous assumptions about the concept of social justice in modern-day political discussions and governmental acts.At the end of the book, the two authors dedicate a lot of time to showing how some of the fateful developments that lead to the spread of the three untruths can be remedied, one of them being the approach of preparing the child for the road rather than the road for the child, thus making children and adolescents actually stronger. All in all, their criticism and analysis of the three untruths is highly convincing, all the more so as they avoid simplistic finger-pointing and instead treat their subject-matter with an impressive degree of intellectual honesty. This book may be a bit repetitive at times, but on the whole, it really helped me get a better understanding of a trend I have also noticed in my own country, Germany, and which I think is something to worry about."

23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7614560-sleepless-dreamer,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’m taking 12 courses this semester so basically, writing reviews is gonna be tough but I refuse to give in. Anyways, I was worried this would be a Republican boomer rant about spoiled college students and I am pleasantly surprised that it's very much not the case.Well researched, the authors claim that there is a culture on campuses that doesn't allow true openness and critical conversations. They describe the three untruths that have taken place: 1. What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker2. Always trust your feelings.3. Life is a battle between good people and evil people.Accepting these three ideas leads young people to being unable to have a free debate on issues. If someone feels offended, they are right, they are in danger and the other side is evil. We do not want to have conversations on topics that support evil people or hurt people’s feelings. The authors point out that this isn't just a left wing problem- both the right and the left feel that offensive ideas should not be allowed in public spaces. This is an important point- I’m used to seeing this as a left wing problem but truly, it is not a partisan problem. At times, this book drawls on more than it should. There were parts that weren’t very necessary (for example, the extensive chapters on parenting). However, the core idea here is eye opening and the plethora of examples highlights how pervasive this is. I do feel worried about the ability to think critical and openly nowadays. How can we face conversation topics when we’re unable to engage in them without genuinely fearing their damage? The interesting question is, of course, where’s the limit of freedom of speech. In the last month, Jimmy Carr and Whoopi Goldberg have made horrible comments about the Holocaust. When Carr suggested the Roma genocide is “a positive”, it seems genuinely malevolent, like “humor” doesn’t cut it, can’t excuse it in any way. Goldberg, meanwhile, tried to argue that the Holocaust wasn’t about race. This seems mostly ignorant. It is a reflection of the narrow American perception of race (”white people killing white people”) and the false view of Judaism as only a religion. Really, the fact that she stole a Jewish last name because she thought it would help her succeed is far more disgusting. Give that back, Whoopi Johnson. What is our response? Goldberg was suspended for two weeks. Carr didn’t even get that (totally proving that Jews do control the media and that as such, we should share more of our power with the Roma). This isn’t right. What we need to do is educate. The idea isn’t that people aren’t allowed to say certain things but rather, that they know better. By silencing these voices, we don’t bother to actively correct them or to have a genuine conversation in which people will learn. Goldberg might remember that she was silenced but will she understand that the Holocaust was very much about race? Our ability to educate relies on academic integrity and critical thinking. It means going beyond our emotions and into intellectual thought. This means that we need to handle opposing thoughts. We need to be able to explain our own opinions and stances beyond our feelings. People around me often tease me for being too PC. I accept this in stride. I would rather nag people around me than contribute to words or frameworks that are needlessly offensive and cruel. Words have power- why waste it? Why hurt people for no reason? And yet, I’ve always believed that speaking in a certain way doesn’t mean you can’t have certain conversations. You can express concerns about medical interventions for trans kids without misgendering them, you can talk about inequality without racial slurs and stereotypes, you can be worried about radicalism without being hateful towards minority groups. In fact, our ability to express what we find problematic without insulting people is incredibly important in order to change minds and policy. If we have valid concerns and reservations, we should be able to speak about them. This book emphasized the way that people really feel in danger by words. It’s not fake. This is interesting because I’ve always thought someone can become desensitized. The authors describe this as anti-fragility. You grow stronger and capable of handling it. Is this strength necessarily a good thing? I’ve heard so many bad takes about the lgbt+ community that I am no longer offended by homophobia. I’m annoyed but I don’t think I am in danger when I hear it. I don’t feel threatened, I feel irritated at worst. On the one hand, I do feel like this makes me stronger, untouchable. On the other hand, it’s taken me so very long to reach this point (shoutout to 18 year old me who was so terrified of coming out). Wouldn’t it have been nicer if I didn’t have to get to this point? If I would have never experienced any homophobia whatsoever? Can we demand of marginalized people (in whatever framework) to develop strength because we do not want to develop understanding towards them? To conclude, reading this book helped me find words and a framework for what is seen often online. There’s room to question the liberal usage of anecdotes as a main tool for making arguments but I do think there’s a lot of truth in this book. It’s been so long since I read it so I worry that this review doesn't grasp everything I wanted to say, but oh well. What I'm Taking with Me- Israel is always a solid 10 years behind the West in terms of culture so I can’t quite see this in my university. If anything, there are too many fights. My university really does have a diverse group of people (or, the girl across from me has a sticker of Palestine from the river to the sea on her laptop while a few minutes ago, I saw someone with a necklace of the Land of Israel with a star of David on it).- I am so ready to be a grouchy old person complaining about the youth.- In one of my courses, we talked about the fatal flaw of liberalism- liberalism seeks to accept anyone but those who are not liberal themselves. In this way, liberalism itself is not liberal and is, in fact, exactly like every ideology- it accepts those who accept it. This dilemma always gives me an existential crisis like oh my god, if we ban racism, we aren’t liberal. If we allow racism, we aren’t liberal, either. Ahh.---------------------Reading this book made me feel robbed of playtime like wow, have I wasted my entire youth preparing for academia? Review to come!"
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13716226-murtaza,Rating 4 out of 5,"Like any other living thing on earth human beings are adaptive. To be strong, they need a Darwinian fitness environment that exposes them to calculated levels of stress. On a physical level, we all accept that the stress of exercise at an appropriate level makes us stronger. But something similar applies to our psychological lives. Some level of adversity and discomfort is not just desirable but necessary to make people mentally and spiritually strong enough to face the vicissitudes and challenges of existence. Without struggles and hardship, which, whether we try to avoid them or not، at some point are inevitable in life, we will be unable to become well-rounded people.As the authors contend, a younger generation is now coming of age which, reared in certain institutions, has been raised on an unhealthy expectation of insulation from discomfort. They are likely to become the new elites of society and have an attitude unfamiliar to older generations, as well as people from lower classes (the majority of people). The habits of mind being inculcated to them are ones of catastrophic thinking, emotional reasoning and Manichean moral frameworks. Rather than as a political disagreement, even a fierce disagreement, the presence of unwelcome ideas is being medicalized and described as a threat to people's physical safety and mental well-being. Even wrong words, regardless of intent, are considered as somehow ""violent"" in and of themselves. To put it another way people are being encouraged by certain institutions to be as psychologically weak as possible. The authors identify three ""Great Untruths"" being taught to many young people: that bad experiences make you weaker, that life can be described simply as a battle between oppressor and oppressed classes and that emotional reasoning is something positive. This is bad advice and something like teaching millions of people to do the opposite of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on themselves. It is inculcating ideas of intense victimhood even in materially privileged people and teaching them at this is a normal way to feel, while also make them hyper-sensitive to perceived signs of disrespect. These attitudes are now slowly trickling down through elite cultural production and also undergoing ""concept creep"" in which old definitional categories of negative social phenomena are slowly and steadily expanding to a wider range of behaviors without anyone knowing where the boundaries are really located. Needless to say this is not a recipe for creating a happy and well-adjusted society.There are certain expressions of language and sociological behaviors among the generation that came just after millennials that are difficult for me to comprehend. This book helped me understand them a bit better. There is also a fascinating (and somewhat disturbing) intellectual lineage going back to the critical theory scholar Herbert Marcuse and an essay he wrote titled ""Repressive Tolerance"" in the 1960s that seems to inform much cultural left-wing discourse today and that also receives some attention here. Some of the sections about ""campus culture"" left me wondering whether previous generations of university students were not also similarly culturally alien to those older than them, but simply aged into more sensible views later in life. This had long been my assumption, though I'm admittedly unsure of the mechanics. In any case, this book helped me understand several things like that which were culturally unfamiliar to me. It is soberly written, reasonable and non-polemic despite its provocative title."

The authors are directing their exposition to the parents of the generation that followed, what they call iGen (internet generation), sometimes referred to as Generation Z. I agree that what they call Three Bad Ideas are bad. Our approach was the opposite. As soon as our kids were old enough, we explained that life was a process of overcoming their fears.I was already familiar with their examples of overreaction on both the Right and the Left from following the news. And have already read many books on the impact of social media on the psyche and social life of users. I agree with the authors that the release of the iPhone in 2007 is a major milestone in all of this.----------Some firsthand reportage from a former dean of students at Stanford....https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/e..."

The authors suggest that young people are anti-fragile by nature but being conditioned to behave with heightened fragility due to the messages they're receiving from educators, parents and peers. The authors highlight academic institutions and parent-child relationships as primary enforcers of the phenomenon of heightened fragility.

If you've ever wondered and worried about the worrying trend of people being publically shamed and harassed to the point that they've lost their reputations, careers and sometimes even physical safety just for expressing an unpopular opinion, this book is an absolute must read. It's actually bipartisan and takes a long scathing look at worrying trends from the left as well as the right and really delves deep into how and why these problems exist, why they're getting so much worse and how we can try to fix them.I can't recommend this one enough. Its thoroughly researched and backed up not just by social science data, but often hard science. I feel thoroughly more informed for having read it and it was honestly a pretty smooth read.Five thought-provoking stars."

That is nothing remarkable in itself, unless you realize that these issues and the perspectives shared in this book have become taboo in our identity-saturated culture. What the authors have done is spoken the unspeakable. In so doing, they have nobly spotted the dangers of political correctness, 'vindictive protectiveness', and 'safetyism', and provided a stark warning to educators and laymen alike.Lukianoff and Haidt do not provide the most robust explanation of how we got here, preferring to remain local and focus on the psychological rather than sociological, political, economic, or philosophical. This is to their credit as non-partisan observers. But it does leave the reader hoping for more depth. It is telling that the authors do not mention Allan Bloom's masterpiece precursor to this work, which takes a broader philosophical view and more adequately explains the origins of our problems.So too do the solutions provided leave much to be desired. Most are commonsensical and some are not practical. The intention is good, and they follow the argument, but they leave the reader wondering if there is something more.Still, The Coddling provides a number of valuable insights. The open-eyed reader will be astonished at the richness of the psychological concepts that Lukianoff and Haidt infuse into their narrative: Concept Creep, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Institutionalized Disconfirmation, and Problems of Progress to name a few of the more fascinating ones. Combining these with the plentiful on-campus examples of coddling gone amok, the authors offer perhaps the best summary of our modern university problems to date.Altogether, this book will serve well anyone who is bold enough to face the uncomfortable truth that we are setting up our future generations for depression and failure, and hopeful enough to do something about it."
30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1655983-katie,Rating 1 out of 5,"The flaws of this book cloud the conclusion. Some of the flaws:-Anecdotes about campus events are used despite authors demand that everyone be more focused on facts and data. Some of the incidents described are indeed examples of extreme sensitivity and intolerance. Worrisome trend, but not convincing that campuses have abandoned free speech.-Serious lack of time spent on investigating and confirming the issues college students care about. The Trump administration is a frightening turn, threatening institutions and norms - shouldn't we expect young people to protest?-CBT as a treatment for anxiety I get, but as a treatment for real threats and oppression? So insulting! We have an administration threatening to take away healthcare, women's health care, rights of immigrants, gay people, minorities. What happens when a lesbian girl is told a speaker believes she is deviant who needs to go to conversion camp? She should practice CBT and remember the speaker has good intentions? When Richard Spencer coming to campus to spout off about peaceful ethnic cleansing, should students practice CBT? Just because the book does justice to some topics - like IGen social issues, helicopter parenting and safteyism, - does not mean the book works. I also happen to agree this generation does not conceive of the First Amendment like my generation does. College kids raised with awareness of inequality in American, we were raised to worry about authoritarianism and the Cold War. I think the topic deserves scrutiny, but these authors failed in my opinion."

There were a lot of interesting points however.Appreciated the frequent references to one of my favorite authors, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, particularly his book Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder.“Free speech and the ability to tolerate offense are the hallmarks of a free and open society.”This book focuses on addressing these three main points:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. "

It's understandable that the authors and publisher went with something a little shorter and punchier.I found the book to be interesting and thought-provoking, with solid reporting of research documenting the perennial, but recently growing liberal bias of faculty and students on American campuses, the recent explosive growth in student demand for mental health services, and recent development of a majority of students not wanting to even be exposed to intolerant or offensive ideas on campus. I was far less convinced that the proposed solutions were practicable or likely to have much impact even on campus problems, the actual focus of the book, much less on polarization and related social ills that were just kind of thrown in with them as things that will be fixed if only everyone lets kid roam and play with less adult supervision, reads this book, goes to the recommended websites, and practices Cognitive Behaviorial Therapy and mindfulness.Still, I thought it was worth reading and recommend it for its ambition to tackle some wide-ranging and timely issues."

It addresses the trend of ""safetyism"" and student fragility--that the ideas of ""dangerous"" have crept from physical harm to emotional discomfort, which is proven not to make our kids STRONGER, but rather emotionally WEAKER. In it the authors not only discuss the problems that have come rather suddenly to college campuses, but the reasons behind them, and how we as parents and educators can correct it . The main theme is that there are Three Great Untruths that a generation has been taught to embrace, but which are what the psychology field knows are ""cognitive distortions."" Harmful ways of thinking that encourage us to see catastrophe, bias, and enemies where there are none. These are things we can universally recognize as untrue...but which are so easy to fall into.I'm not a big non-fiction reader these days, but I loved this book and have already made some changes to the rules for my kids based on the very sound evidence presented in it, as well as the wonderful advice.What I loved most about this book though is that it's quite possibly the only UNBIASED view I've encountered in recent years. Near the end of the book the authors do tell us their political views but up until they came out and said it, I had no idea whether they were liberal or conservative, D or R, even though they were discussing issues that dealt with the widening gap between them. They instead got at exactly what they encourage their readers to get at in our own lives: the wider circle of humanity to which we all belong."

This monograph explores how 'fragility' is being developed in children, adolescence and students on university campuses. While much of the attention is on the left and social justice politics, there is some focus on the polarization of politics from the alt-right.The problems with this book are clear. The authors confuse a diversity of facts and interpretations with emotions rather than rigour. EH Carr stated in 1961 that ""history means interpretation."" Only particular facts have survived to our present. Therefore assuming that the source material - the material culture - that remains in our present is accurate, true and convincing while alternative interpretations are emotional or intuitive perpetuates a mis-understanding of history, media and politics.Are students fragile? Perhaps. The greater question is why students are fragile. That is the question not asked or answered in this book. Unemployment, under-employment, exhorbitant fees for education, ridiculous payments for privatized utilities, and ill-information public policies are only part of our corrosive present.Protests exist because there is no space to be different, to be defiant, and - in the case of George Floyd - to breathe. This is not emotion or intent. This is verified and an outcome of claustropolitan structures. A provocative book. It lacks a deep engagement of the political economy. Therefore - and ironically - it is part of the identity politics superficiality it wishes to critique."

The important books are the ones you think about even while you’re reading a different book. This one has been that for me. It’s not that everything the authors argue is definitely right or that no objections can be raised; rather, it’s that the authors have clearly allowed their ideas to be shaped by the evidence they’ve seen and the data they’ve collected, instead of vice versa. If nothing else, this is a social record of the consequences of parenting: wokeness and cancel culture cannot do anything that wasn’t already prepped by well meaning parents.

This makes them unable to cope, and harms them and their causes.I. Why this book is a waste of spaceTo understand why this book goes wrong, its important to appreciate a central tension in the way we think about ideas. On one hand, clearly people have been wrong about so much in the past and therefore as Mill suggests we should keep avenues for debate and change always open. On the other hand, the content of ideas currently held actually matter because they shape the world we live in both symbolically and materially. Therefore, if a certain idea is deemed wrong, it is important to resist it and its spread. It's the inability of creatures like ourselves, condemned to live in time, to resolve this tension in any general way that leads to so much chatter about free speech and its limits.The problem with the authors of this book is that they model debates as though ideas don't matter except for debate, as though fermenting debate itself were the point of ideas. The notion that there power differentials that are deeply entrenched and might not be removed by polite argumentation doesn't even come up.For example, a convenient manner to think about oppression is through ""structural analysis"" which helps make sense of the institutions and experiences that are frequent and persistent. To live in this miasma isn't merely about encountering scary ideas but actually being harmed in a variety of ways, and it really is unclear what the best way to resist and liberate. But the authors are convinced that they know best, since obviously more speech and more ideas is how victory will be won. They make much use of how the recent victories for same-sex marriage included campaigning that stressed similarity and shared community, but conveniently leave out how Stonewall was a riot.When they come close to discussing the obviously relevant idea of power, they just manage feebly to say:In calling for the dismantling of power structures, the author was using a set of terms and concepts that are common in some academic departments; the main line of argumentation fell squarely within the large family of Marxist approaches to social and political analysis. It’s a set of approaches in which things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Groups struggle for power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is a moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It’s a variant of the pathological dualism that Rabbi Sacks described in the quotation at the start of this chapter.All structural analysis are first reduced to ""groups struggle for power"" and then into instances of ""pathological dualism"" between the ""unimpeachably good and the irredeemably bad"".There are a lot of serious critiques possible about the relevance and fruitfulness of thinking about oppression as ""structural"", but this glib dismissal is intellectually embarrassing.Their unwillingness to take power seriously makes this entire book a slog through shallow liberal moralizing. Instead of responding to Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny's point about how it is better to concentrate on the incident and impact instead of intent, because it makes it much, much harder to call out harmful behaviour, they just assume intent is what matters, and so anyone thinks otherwise is labouring under a ""cognitive distortion""The most evident is catastrophizing: If Milo Yiannopoulos is allowed to speak, there will be “broken bodies” on our side. I might lose my “right to exist.” Therefore, violence is justified, because it is self-defense. The author also engages in dichotomous thinking: If you condemn my side’s violence, that means you condone Yiannopoulos’s ideas. You must “pick a side.” You’re either with us or against us. Life is a battle between good people and evil people, and if you disagree with us, you’re one of the evil people…But if asking for peaceful dialogue is violent, then it seems that the word “violence” is taking on new meanings for some students.The point here isn't even that the Milo protests were the obvious way to go (although Milo's inability to get funding since suggests so), but that it's quite impossible to know antecedently or even in the short-term which strategies will be successful. Does treating every small incident as though it's important work better or does taking a more judicious strategy? Despite this lack of clarity about the truth, the authors frame the debate as young college students with good hearts making foolish choices instead of considering that they might possibly be engaging in successful resistance to entrenched evils.II. Why this book is still importantDespite this, there are three reasons this still remains a decent book.First, a significant chunk of the book concerns trends that converge in the iGen generation, including the lack of opportunity for free play, more bureaucracy, etc. It's really fun to read in one place, even if the information isn't new Second, it really is true that a lot of incidents of campus have been horrific, indicating that thinking you're on the right side of history allows for sadism and heedlessness. If you're on social media and have a functioning brain, you know the Left can go overboard in its mob mentality. As from above, I don't think we can say with certainty that these methods as a whole won't be successful, but they clearly do go against strong moral sensibilities at times. The Heckler's veto against anyone conservative, violence, cruelty all seem unacceptable, however much we tell ourselves it might ultimately be for the best.Third, the book is a lot more compelling if we don't think of it as a political project at all, but about psychologists simply talking about trends in the progressive movement that might be affecting mental health, fostering unhealthy ideas, and leading to irrational behaviour. At higher levels of explanation, trends might emerge that might be difficult to account for on a case-by-case basis, and I think the authors present a plausible case that taken as a whole, a lot of practices might be making the situation worse for students.Overall, a book better read as a summary of recent events on American campuses than as any kind of original contribution."

It is something I have seen and I now have a label for it and can hopefully better communicate the risks.But, I also struggled often with this book. I think that saying someone shouldn't be offended by a comment that you didn't know would be offensive removes the responsibility from the speaker to learn anything that could stop them from saying hurtful/offensive things in the future - most of the examples they use are of ways in which people say things that perpetuate systems of oppression (racism, sexism, etc) and by shrugging things off, the system doesn't get fixed. If the speaker were able to listen and change, then getting offended wouldn't be useful, but too often that's not the outcome. This is a topic I have been working though - I don't always understand why someone got offended, but when I listen or read, I can usually get it. But it comes back on me to learn, not them to get thick skin (I'm not always the speaker, but usually a somewhat confused bystander in these cases).It will raise my hackles when a book uses the version of MLK Jr that only encompasses his Dream speech and not also his other letter, sermons, and speeches. I think they simplified things too much on this respect.The sections laying out how various professors and others in academia have been mistreated was good at pointing out the failings of those areas, but I think that if you are looking for it you could easily find bad behavior in religion, in business, in government, etc. Every aspect of our culture contains humans and within that subset, they may *misbehave* in different ways, but every area has people who misuse power or are unqualified. I also have a few gripes with the way they discuss campus protests. I think we would agree about a lot of this, but I want to point that people like Heather McDonald and Charles Murray have writt books, the people protesting them are almost certainly aware of their views (either by reading the book or discussing parts of it) and they are choosing to say that this person has bad ideas. It is not that HM or CM don't get any chance to speak or promote their ideas - they still have free speech. It is more that students wish the wouldn't be given platforms for these ideas. I agree with Coddling in that violence is abhorrent and counterproductive, but they way they frame the rest of the conversation is in error.Overall - it was a book that made me think, but had some very problematic portions."
40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5000820-heidi-sbooks,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars. I really, really liked this book. I think it helped me understand where people are coming from especially after just reading Caste by Isabel Wilkerson.I have 3 millenials and 2 iGen kids, and this has opened up an understanding into why they and their peers think the way they do. All of them went to college, and 1 is getting a Master's degree in History. It was interesting to read about what is going on at college campuses. So... I must confess that I homeschooled all of them K-12; the epitome of coddling. Part of the reason I did that is freedom to live and learn the way we wanted to. They all had a structured study time, but because there were 5 of them they also had lots of unstructured time to play and read. They were always expected to read about both sides of an issue, and for extra-curricular activities we were involved in competitive speech. I can see where most of what we did was right. However, I must confess I was too conscious of safety, and I supervised some of their outdoor play. They have been taught 3 great untruths: they are fragile, trust your feelings, and life is a battle between good and evil people. The authors explain why these ideas are bad and what it does to kids as they mature and grow. When these generations go off to college, they have a much lower tolerance level for differences of ideas. They are concerned about safety and even concerned about extending that safety into speech issues. Sometimes they use intimidations and violence to protect themselves from harmful speech, speech that makes them feel bad or unsafe. The right-leaning media takes those incidences and polarizes the issue. Things escalate and that's why you have students needing safe spaces... and then there are marches from neo-nazis which turn violent. (Interestingly enough the authors never mentioned how the left-leaning media stirs the pot.)The authors bring out some of the whys. Polarization is huge in our society. The rates of anxiety and depression have skyrocketed in large part due to social media usage, paranoid parenting and the illogical fear of abduction, the decline of play, the growth of campus bureaucracy, and the quest for justice. The authors both vote democratic, however, I think they took both parties to task.I'm not sure about all the proposed fixes for the problems, but I think this is an important national conversation."

42,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"I'm always interested in books critiquing our current educational system and sat down to read this one with enthusiasm. However, this book is less about what is wrong with our system and more about criticizing liberals for the horrors they have wrought upon our society. It begins with vilifying our current crop of college students: kids born after 1995 who began going to college in 2013. These children are having three great untruths fed to them by liberal universities: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. They go on to say that by creating safe spaces, colleges teach students to believe the above. The evidence? Students are preventing speakers from holding lectures they disagree with at their universities. As others have pointed out, this in no way keeps the speaker from disseminating their ideas. Milo, the target of one of these riots, was still making television appearances and publishing books. The students were asking that he not be allowed to speak in spaces their tuition paid for, a very different thing than asking that he never be allowed to speak anywhere. Moreover, this wasn't a question of not giving the speaker a chance to present his point but a reaction to the point the speaker had already made. Finally, the United States has over 3,000 4 yr. universities and the author's ""evidence"" centers around approximately 1% of those institutions having students make demands they felt were unreasonable. This is nowhere near epidemic. Then the authors get to what I felt was the primary point: Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. To sum up the first portion of the book has two major points: Anything that prevents someone from making a point, even if that point is offensive, is ""coddling"" and colleges are too liberal. We need more balance. (They didn't speak to the 600 Christian colleges where the staff is predominantly conservative.) After spending several chapters ""building a case"" on how the great untruths listed in the first paragraph are destroying young collegiate minds, the author's come to a startling conclusion: You can see why it was hard for us to make a strong case that universities were causing students to become anxious and depressed by teaching them disordered ways of thinking. Anxiety and depression rates were already rising for all teenagers before they arrived at college, and for those who never attended college as well. Clearly universities were not causing a national mental health crisis; they were responding to one. With liberal universities out as a scapegoat, bring in liberal parenting policies. Safteyism, where parents go to purportedly unreasonable limits to protect their kids might be a factor in kids being more fearful, which might be a factor in them being depressed. No direct evidence of this is available but they offer up some random events and show how those few events point to liberals running amok and creating too much fear in our kids. They have to admit, grudgingly, that many of the safety measures have worked. Putting it all together, from 1960 to 1990, there was a 48% reduction in deaths from unintended injuries and accidents among kids between five and fourteen years of age, and a 57% drop in deaths of younger kids (ages one to four).Lukianoff, Greg. The Coddling of the American Mind (p. 169). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. In summary, the authors offer anecdotes and a handful of studies to showcase their points but the math in no way supports what they are saying. If you are someone who feels PC culture is at the heart of what is wrong with our country, you'll love this book and may believe it supports your view point. If you know how to do elementary school level math and have an understanding of the basic principle of percentages, you will quickly realize this tome is meant to speak into a very specific echo chamber and provides no substantial evidence to support the view that liberals will be the death of America."
43,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10132670-amy-vanhym,Rating 1 out of 5,"""The Coddling of the American Mind: In which we Coddle the American Coddlers."" This book pokes the villains with a few soft cushions. It assumes ""good intentions"" without bothering to prove the point, and even does so while describing clearly bad-intentioned behaviour. Very bluepilled, very blinders-on, very head-in-the-sand. Far too forgiving of perpetrators, propagandists and opportunists; makes excuses for abusers frequently. Ignores the root causes of the problems it describes: the word ""marxism"" only appears once or twice, and ""misandry"" doesn't appear at all. A very soft-hitting and shallow approach to the issues. It gets the easiest things right (like the absurdity of the 'microaggression'), but is that really much of an achievement? Could be a first step in the right direction for the uninitiated, but also risks distracting readers from more complete explanations. These authors display a CNN-addict's understanding of some political narratives (including the Las Vegas shooting and Charlottesville). They seem too soft to have broken from the coddled mindset themselves.Authors also insist upon reinventing the wheel in their emphatic promotion of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). What they're branding ""CBT"" is as old as the West: we call it ""reflection."" It's what artists and philosophers have been doing for centuries, yet these charlatans see fit to steal the history of Western thought from under us, rebrand it with their ""CBT"" label and sell it back to us as if they and their colleagues came up with it themselves. Here we see the effects of historical revisionists taking advantage of the college-perpetuated modern ignorance of great Western literature to parasitically inflate their appearance of relevancy while at the same time oversimplifying the subject matter. There's also an effort (page 220) to make the concept of social justice palatable by defining it by what is actually just an aspect of simple justice: equal opportunity. The authors accept that there is a ""bad kind"" of social justice, and then claim that the ""good kind"" of social justice is the one that means ""equal opportunity."" Except, equal opportunity only matters because it affects individuals, thus making it a matter of justice, full stop. Justice. Not ""social justice."" At best, ""social justice"" is a tautology, as there is a social element inherent to all justice because it exists to moderate human interactions; at worst and most commonly, ""social justice"" is a Marxist bait and switch tactic for acquiring tyrannical political power. Don't trust any effort to apologize for it or make it palatable. ""Social justice"" has no acceptable form.This book is an indecisive, gutless, capitulatory mudpuddle. If you understand the issues you'll be bored, frustrated and a little insulted, and if you don't understand the issues you'll be distracted from them."

Comes with the territory of studying Leninist political systems. I read this stuff, so you don't have to! Instead of running away from poor ideology and opinions that differ from my own, I find that my mind and my intellect is strengthen by wrestling against different ideas and belief systems. I echo so much of what is contained within this book, and I share the authors' concerns that today's college students are intellectually coddled by society. This creates major issues in college classrooms, where lively debate and discussion should thrive. I'm still trying to process the ramifications, but I know it will be important to move towards the younger generation and help them sit in uncomfortable ideas and embrace good debates. We need them to contribute to the marketplace of ideas, and we need them to help solve the major problems of the world. I feel like the book lacked positive, compelling vision for why people should embrace this generation, rather than just playing intellectual defense. The book's only flaw."

47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7282974-amanda,Rating 3 out of 5,"this was a juicy one. i have a feeling i'm about to dump out a whole bunch of messy rambly word-vomit haha. first off, thank u to my sweet kayak for introducing me to this book!!! it made me think. like a LOT. i spent the entire duration of the book mentally arguing with the authors and trying to generate counterexamples (my neighbors witnessed me scowling and muttering to myself for like 10+ hours bc i listened to the audiobook on my walks). even though haidt and lukianoff lowkey ruined many walks for me (kidddding hehe. kinda), i think this book was really good for me. at the very least as an exercise in critical thinking. it pushed me to question things i honestly never thought toin this book, haidt and lukianoff describe how, starting around 2013, college campuses began to experience a startling increase in mental health crises and a decrease in tolerance for opposing viewpoints. the authors try to elucidate these trends by showing how the students who entered college that year and the years following were taught and led to believe the ""three great untruths"": the world is split into good vs. evil, what doesn't kill u makes you weaker, and you should trust your emotions above all else. these untruths are propagated by a mix of factors, from parenting to social media to politics, and even though good intentions generally underlie them, the result is kiddos and students who are less equipped to handle college and life and all of its messiness.i still have mixed feelings about quite a few of the authors' arguments (like their sections on microaggressions, trigger warnings, and campus safe spaces, esp in relation to campus sexual assault), but i definitely have a more informed perspective now, so thank u haidt and lukianoff for that. they bring up really valuable points, and they try to be really reasonable and objective throughout. they seek to understand college students, not just shit on them. both work with students, and they want to empower them by countering the idea that kids are fragile and need to be protected at all costs. the authors advocate instead for viewing children through the lens of anti-fragility (kids grow more competent and stronger when they are faced with some challenge and risk. and i mean the normal, natural risks that come up day to day. deliberate harm/neglect is a big no). part of promoting anti-fragility: exposing students to viewpoints they might find uncomfortable and offensive but showing them how to critically engage with those viewpoints. haidt and lukianoff argue that college is a wonderful opportunity for students to disagree and clash in a safe and controlled environment before they inevitably have to do so in the ""real"" world, and things like trigger warnings, safe spaces, and speaker cancellations are counterproductive bc they insulate students from viewpoints they don't want to hear but perhaps would benefit from hearing. haidt and lukianoff kind of characterize trigger warnings and safe spaces as a form of escapism. i think of trigger warnings, safe spaces, and other similar resources as attempts to create more effective and more accessible learning environments, but after listening to this book, i can see how good intentions don't necessarily mean good impacts. however, i don't think the answer is returning to how universities functioned pre-2013. stress and trauma impact our brain function and inhibit our ability to learn (i had to learn about dr. bruce perry's research on this in a class a few weeks ago!), and it's important to find ways to help learners navigate that. even if things like trigger warnings and safe spaces are found to not work, i think they along with other campus resources can continue to evolve. i don't think creating a space for intellectual debate and a space for comfort and safety are mutually exclusive, and i wish the authors explored better mechanisms for both rather than repeating something along the lines of ""universities are meant to be uncomfy places"" and ""students just have to suck it up"" again and again.nevertheless, i agree with haidt and lukianoff more than i disagree. i think their part on concept creep is SO interesting!! i hear the word ""trauma"" used on almost a daily basis in my classes, and i would agree that its definition has expanded and grown a bit nebulous. this book also tackles big questions on handling offensive materials and censorship, and i appreciated listening to this book as the news dropped about the removal of some of dr. seuss' books from print and amazon's ban of books portraying lgbtq+ identities as mental illness. the part of the book that resonates the most with me, however, is the parenting section. haidt and lukianoff do a deep dive into how igen (the generation born between 1995 and 2012, and the generation that, surprise surprise, started showing up on college campuses in 2013) was raised, and how igen's parents somehow became super duper obsessed with safety and protecting their kids from EVERY single risk. as a result, this generation spent a lot less time playing outdoors and a lot more time inside, under adult supervision. there was also a bigger emphasis on academic achievement and test-prep from a ridiculously young age. i think the authors do a superb job of showing how a culture of safetyism, which is rooted in viewing kids as fragile rather than anti-fragile, can backfire and prevent children from maturing, and how this then has enduring effects once the kids go to college. i very much agree that free play is awesome and should be promoted more in educational settings and at home!! (but i think it's worth mentioning that their commentary on overprotective parents only really applies to upper- and middle-class families. haidt and lukianoff do acknowledge the differences in parenting between middle-class and working-class families, but they don't dig super deep into it and its implications for college campuses. they kinda act like college campuses are only made up of middle-class students)ok so here's the thing: i very much fall into igen. i was raised by extremely risk-averse, middle-class parents who worship safetyism (although since my parents are chinese immigrants, i think their reasons for embracing safetyism differ from some of the reasons the authors lay out. this is also something i'd like to keep thinking about). many of my friends, esp those i knew pre-college, grew up in really similar circumstances, and while we are far from perfect and definitely not always self-aware, we've had a lot of conversations about how our parents raised us. even before i knew of this book, i spoke with friends about my privileged, sheltered upbringing, with a focus on test-prep and college and all that. and i have held fears for years and years that i am all of the things that haidt and lukianoff describe about igen: that i am morally dependent on authority figures and am immature, that i can't handle nuance or viewpoint diversity, that i run away from risk, that i have hidden in my intellectual safety bubble for all of college so far. so...yeah!! fun!! haha i think that's maybe why listening to this book was such a weird experience. i felt like i was being diagnosed. this book validated a lot of those fears i mentioned, and honestly, i don't really know what to do with all of that now. i don't think haidt and lukianoff write this book specifically for members of igen--at the end of the book, they have a where-do-we-go-from-here section where they offer advice, but it's primarily targeted toward parents and universities. (maybe i should just...try college again? give it another go? honestly i'm not opposed to that)i think what is missing from this book for me is the voice of igen. ok yes obviously i'm biased--i'm part of igen and all my experiences are colored by that. i've spent most of my life surrounded by people in this generation. but this is a book about what is happening on college campuses, and the voices of present-day college students are drowned out by the adults like haidt and lukianoff and other adult authorities who just keep saying ""college kids these days are different than we used to be!"" (they also make a lot of arguments that start off with ""when we were young..."" and i feel pretty meh about those). this might just be me, but i don't think haidt and lukianoff feature enough perspectives from students, even though they are trying to dig into the thoughts and behaviors of this group. they quote a few students, but mostly they just describe shocking events that have happened on college campuses in the past years and portray the students involved as a homogenous group. i've learned a lot about these issues over the years bc of conversations with my igen peers, and i think many would have good insight on what haidt and lukianoff write about. overall, i think this book is interesting and provides much food for thought!!"
48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2007216-peter-derk,Rating 4 out of 5,"What an interesting book.I think what would prevent most people from reading this is probably some version of a sentiment that can be summed up as ""Okay Boomer."" But if that's how you're feeling, I would encourage you to give it a shot.Although there are lots of examples from college campuses, they're pretty balanced between things that overly-sensitive people are doing and things that crazy people are doing (usually white power weirdos). And while there is some condemnation of behavior, I felt like the author was very empathetic towards people and wasn't saying anything remotely like, ""These snowflakes need to shape up!"" or ""These iGen kids are ruining everything!"" If you read it that way, that's probably your preconceived notion and sensitivity lenses at work, not the real content of the book. The most interesting portions to me were related to parenting and how much it's changed in just a few decades. There was a section that listed a checklist for parents for school readiness for young kids. 30 or 40 years ago, the list was a lot of things like, ""You child can ride a two-wheel bicycle, Your child can walk alone to a store or home 2 or 3 blocks away..."" where now it looks more like, ""Your child can spell phonetically, Your child can understand basic mathematical concepts..."" So where once it was ""Is your child capable of managing their physical safety?"" now it's more ""Can your child fill out a worksheet?"" Which seems profoundly stupid to me. This is my Okay Boomer moment, so buckle up.When I was a kid we used to roam around the town in small groups of 2-4 kids. Sometimes on bikes, sometimes just walking. And it wasn't like we had to check in every hour with our parents. I rode the bus to the mall. I would go to the grocery store alone or with a friend. In the summer, this was basically all we did, screw around during unstructured time. You learn a lot without realizing it. You learn to avoid true danger, like weirdos and creeps. You learn how to do simple shit like walk into a grocery store, pick something out and pay for it. You learn how to take a bus. You learn the geography of where you live. I had a coworker who lived in a very safe neighborhood and wouldn't allow her son to walk to the bus alone. It was like a block. Eventually, she did let him do it, but he had to be on a walkie talkie and talk to her the whole time until he got on the bus. I've had a number of people tell me that when their kids are learning to drive, they have no idea where they are inside of their own towns. They don't know how to get from home to school. Every day, the school I work next to, parents line up their cars to drive up to the door of the school, at which point their child is released, gets in the car, and then the parents drive them home. Like they're goddamn diplomats in need of a secure escort. This line of cars extends several blocks, and parents will wait up to an hour in a line of cars to pick up their kids. The kids can walk or bike or whatever, but very few, if any, do this, and if they do want to do it this way the parents have to sign a waiver. I can already hear the parents: You don't have a kid, so you don't understand. If you don't have kids, you'll hear this all the time. And I totally agree, I don't have the emotional understanding of a parent. However, I would proffer this: I probably have a more realistic assessment of danger to children because I'm NOT a parent. I'm not emotionally invested, which means when I'm looking at the realistic dangers, my thinking isn't tainted by my personal stakes. There are some parents who agree with me, that kids should have a little more freedom. There was the mom profiled in the book, the sort of mother of the Free Range Kids movement, who let her young son ride the subway home by himself at one point, which turned out great.I do think kids probably need a little more room, a little more agency, and a little less structure. One of the more profound insights in the book had to do with the level of discourse we're experiencing today. In short, people suck at discussing things because they never had un-referee'ed disagreements as kids. When you're a kid, if you're playing a game with 4 other kids, you have to learn how to argue or disagree without the other kid getting up and leaving, at which point the game is unplayable. Newer parents tend to referee everything, jumping in if things get intense. But letting kids work these things out themselves might be a way to help them learn the skills of discussing things without getting to the point that everyone takes their ball and goes home.The best part of the book, however, is that it offers a lot of potential solutions. I've found that I'm a solutions-based thinking, so solutions speak to me. Even when I disagree with the solutions, I think solutions-oriented thinking speaks to me and gets me thinking along the lines of productive movement. Way too many books that I might put in the sociology category seem very focused on talking about the problem. I usually hear what the author is saying and think, ""Okay, I buy that this is a problem, but what now?"" To borrow an analogy from another book, a problem that's well-explained is great, but if you went to the doctor with a pain, and if that doctor could explain why you're feeling this pain, does knowing the pain's origin solve the problem? No. You go to the doctor not for an explanation of the history of the pain, but for the cure. It's how I feel when a cold is being passed around the office, and everyone wants to trace back to patient zero. As if it's really that person's fault. Sidebar: it's my pet peeve that people come in when they're sick. Don't do that. But once you're sick, figuring out who ""got you sick"" is a complete waste of time and energy. Once you know, does that help your symptoms? Does it speed your recovery? Absolutely not. Yes, I think the history of some things can be valuable in understanding them. But the history and origin of a problem without solution is not terribly useful. I think a lot of people don't have the guts to offer a solution. Because that's the easiest thing to attack. You can nitpick someone's solution, which will be seen as an effective way of discrediting their entire argument. Which is stupid. I deeply appreciate the solutions offered in this book, especially because they're solutions based mostly in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (which totally works) and because they're solutions that any individual can choose to apply. It's not a set of solutions that goes ""You motherfuckers need to stop doing X."" It's a set of solutions oriented towards, ""If you want to be a better person and have a better life, here are some realistic options.""Great read, and I'd definitely call it a must-read for parents of young kids who haven't given a lot of thought to giving their kid some rope. And parents who feel pressured by other parents, who are afraid of being seen as bad parents."

The book examines what call-out culture is, the belief system that fuels it, and why it became so prevalent on college campuses. The authors also examine why this behavior is becoming so entrenched, and details several steps to break out of it.I've been a fan of Jonathan Haidt's work for many years, and I watched several of his presentations on YouTube when this book first debuted. I thought I understood the book's concepts without needing to read it. Then in December of 2021, the popular film critic, video essayist, and bestselling author, Lindsay Ellis, announced that she was quitting YouTube, due to the physical and mental stress she had undergone after being ""cancelled"" over a Tweet in March 2021.The news hit me hard, and when a transgender YouTuber (a supporter of Lindsay Ellis) read aloud the private letter Ellis posted to explain why she was quitting YouTube, it hit harder still. It inspired me to do a lot of reflection on cancel culture and the current zeitgeist of Twitter. I really don't like this place we are in, in which progressive liberals stop giving anyone the benefit of the doubt, interpret offhand remarks from other progressive liberals in the worst way imaginable, and then go after these people in mob-attacks that are all about ruining someone's reputation in the name of ""standing up for the marginalized."" The liberal Left has convinced itself that going after people on their own side politically, also known as ""shooting your own dissidents,"" is the path of justice, and it really sickens me. When any group shoots its own dissidents, they are in line with the Nazis, Stalin, and Mao. This isn't about justice; it's about power.And for the record, the Nazis, Stalin, and Mao committed mass atrocities. These people are not the ""voices of justice.""So ran my thoughts as I took in the heartbreaking news that Lindsay Ellis had left YouTube. She received a groundswell of support from conservative, Right-leaning and Right-voting YouTubers, who encouraged her to ""heal and come back,"" to ""not let the haters win,"" and other such supportive comments. It did my heart good to see so many popular YouTubers condemn the mob-attack that had caused Ellis so much personal pain.A number of those conservative YouTubers cited this book, ""The Coddling of the American Mind,"" as being one that Lindsay Ellis should read and draw strength from. I immediately got my hands on a copy, and read it as well. Those conservative YouTubers were right: this is exactly the book to help anyone caught up in the hell of cancel culture, call-out culture, and the Maoist shame-circle tactics of progressive liberals hell-bent on McCarthy-esque witch hunts. Successfully driving Lindsay Ellis off of YouTube and Twitter over a Tweet is not fighting oppression. This is not helping to lift anyone out of poverty, improve educational outcomes for disadvantaged youth, increase wages for low-wage workers, provide housing for the homeless, increase aid services for the disabled, guarantee safe drinking water for impoverished communities, or any of the other numerous tasks that improve health outcomes and quality of life for everyone in society. But the more these witch hunts take innocent people down, the more progressive liberals are telling themselves they are ""standing up for the marginalized"" and ""fighting oppression."" As if shooting your own dissidents ever helped anyone. I'm so very glad Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt wrote this book. It definitely makes sense of the senseless. Five million stars.Highly recommended."
50,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25032671-kris,Rating 4 out of 5,"I first read Bloom's original The Closing of the American Mind just so that I could read this book. While it's useful to have the earlier background on past decades in academia, Bloom's original is not required reading before enjoying Haidt's great contribution here.These authors lead the reader through some great analyses -- they show how a drastic shift in the mentality of arguments/debate on college campuses happened in 2013, along with a seemingly drastic shift in mindset surrounding the purpose of education. I'll list some of their principles here: Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and confirmation bias. Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own unguarded thoughts. People are prone to catastroph-izing about the future. We are all prone to tribalism. Many psychological principles on college campuses encourage students to embrace foolishness, rather than wisdom. Young people are innately anti-fragile, but they learn helplessness in correlation with rising rates of adolescent depression and anxiety, a shift to more protective parenting, and widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation. We are seeing rising political polarization and expanded bureaucracy. We also see a rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to attaining equal outcomes in all areas. The rise in passion for justice is admirable on its own, but when combined with a demand to see equity, not equality, it becomes misguided.Some falsehoods: What doesn't kill you, makes you weaker. Always trust your feelings. Life is a battle between good people and evil people.Read Bob's 4-star review here: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17519772-jordan-shirkman,Rating 5 out of 5,"It’s imperative that we understand that the culture of American colleges and universities is a symptom of a greater disease: insulating young people from any contrary idea as we pursue safetyism instead of truth.Having personally graduated from college in 2011 and not experiencing much of what this book describes on campus, it was fascinating to learn about the shifts that happened with the first students of Gen Z arriving on campus in 2013.If we want our society to continue to seek and uphold truth, even at the cost of anger, threats, and violence, we must wrestle with the realities of raising overprotected kids who see fear lurking behind every corner and instead instill in them a desire for truth at any cost."
52,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1895570-jim,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure by Jonathan Haidt is essentially an attempt to explain why the United States is increasingly divided into hostile camps, why the Internet generation (iGen) is depressed and suicidal, why college campuses are waging wars over trifles, and why reason seems to have been dethroned.That's a mighty tall order, but Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff have done a workmanlike job explaining such key 21st century concepts as microaggressions, safe spaces, helicopter parenting, cancel culture, ""snowflakes,"" and a whole host of other phenomena. This is a book that will reward any halfway intelligent reader who is concerned with current trends."

54,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24682440-tom-stamper,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Coddling of the American Mind is a riff on Allan Bloom’s classic 1980s book, the Closing of the American Mind, where Bloom, if I remember correctly, writes that most college kids aren’t ready for the rigor of a college education so college education is a watered down beyond the intellectual rigor that it was once known for. Jonathan Haidt and co-author Greg Lukianoff believe kids aren’t ready for the rigors of college and thus adulthood because they have been coddled by their parents and teachers and taught that they are fragile and must be protected physically and emotionally. This is due partly to the self-esteem cult that awards every kid a trophy and partly the terror in the media convincing everyone that kids are not safe without 24/7 supervision. Colleges have responded to these new students (customers) by creating speech codes and safe spaces. Rather than be shocked at the absurd idea that free speech is outlawed in a place of learning, we should instead see how this was the inevitable yield of the crop of kids we ourselves cultivated.There are very few free-range kids these days. Almost all activities are scheduled and supervised by adults so kids never really learn how to resolve conflicts and problems on their own. Further, parents are so afraid of something physically happening to their kids that they train the kids to grow up to be neurotic. This does make sense in my experience. I’m Generation X and we would to spend all day during summer vacation playing on abandoned construction sites and vacant lots. If we went deep enough into the woods we might get lost. It was part of the adventure. It was common for us to ride our bikes to our elementary school to play on the jungle gym without any adult supervision. I did these things at age 7. My mom’s only rule was we were not to cross the busy main thoroughfare. She never asked what we did or what we planned to do. And yet I felt downright constrained compared to my dad’s stories of taking his wagon for a 5 mile walk along a main road to pick tomatoes in order to come back to town and sell them for the purchase of baseball cards. In my day there might be kids that would take their ball and go home when the rules weren’t constructed to their liking. They were shunned until they compromised or left the group. The bossy ones would either learn to negotiate or be gone. It taught us how to be conciliatory. Looking back, I can remember kids who were the hardest to play with and I can see they were more coddled than us. Their parents would call our parents to complain. This splintered the neighborhood into allies and rivals which was also a good lesson to learn about adult life. Until reading this book, I didn’t realize how important these lessons were. I thought our play was wasting time when we could have been reading books. I felt guilty the first time I left my 10 year-old alone at home for 15 minutes to pick up something at the store. She was a little hesitant at first, but not wanting to leave her video game was stronger than the fear of solitude. Our kids rarely go knocking on doors to play with neighbor kids. Instead they play team sports at the YMCA or Girl Scouts or they participate in service clubs at school. I don’t know how we got here because it wasn’t something I intended to do, but neither did my parents give me free range as a strategy. Both situations were normal in their times. If there is one place I disagree with the authors, it’s that I tend to think this campus fragility isn’t evenly spread among conservative and liberal kids although he provides anecdotal evidence of both. Outside of political science majors or groups like college Republicans, conservative kids don’t study political philosophy and policies the way liberal kids do. The majors that are political in nature are liberal. There are no rightwing equivalents of environmental science and law, gender and race studies, sociology, and psychology. But while the conservative kid is less likely to be triggered by disagreeable speech his path to adulthood is still blocked by the same coddling. He will be less ready for office politics and group dynamics that were worked out previously on that vacant lot. One solution that Haidt and Lukianoff offer is for mandatory military or national service before college. I can see the appeal of this considering the current circumstances, but I think it’s a contradictory solution to the real problem he outlines earlier in the book. Parents need to stop treating their kids as fragile. So when parents actually give their kids the freedom to make mistakes and to learn and fail, they will ready for adulthood. The national service idea will be a punishment for the well-adjusted. Let’s not take the bad idea of parents giving their children less freedom and mandate a national law that takes away the freedom of young adults."
55,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5862443-joseph-stieb,Rating 4 out of 5,"Full disclosure: I am a Haidt fanboy, so I'm predisposed to like this book. Unlike the Righteous Mind, it is not outstanding. Books that are elaborations of long-form articles rarely are. If you follow Haidt and Lukianoff's work closely, this is mainly a summary of what they have been doing the last 4 years of so (see Haidt's excellent Wriston Lecture for a distillation). Still, this is a strong, well-sourced, and fair-minded argument about where higher ed has turned wrong and how it can be rectified.Haidt and Lukianoff argue for an older understanding of the purpose of higher education: the pursuit of truth rather than the furthering of a political agenda. They convincingly show how higher ed has become more partisan and less ideologically diverse, although they don't do much to show how this stultifies and biases research and teaching (for more on this, see Shields and Dunn's outstanding Passing on the Right). Their focus is on why things like trigger warnings, disinvitations, interruptions of speakers, micro-aggressions, etc have surged on campus in the last 5 years or so. The core of their argument is less about ideology than generational shifts. Despite the somewhat inflammatory title, they put forth a complex, nuanced argument that the I-Gen (born in mid 1990s, came of age with cellphones and social media as normal things, in contrast to millennial, who were teens when the iPhone and facebook came out) is a far more anxious and dependent generation that doesn't know how to handle conflict on its own and has been coached to go to the authorities instead. Take a far more polarized, bureaucratized university system, and you get more kids calling for ""coddling"" and more administrators giving it to them to prevent their school from becoming the next Yale or Missouri. The leftist intellectual framework that these students embrace (redefinition of safety and violence, identitarian common enemy politics, a radical interpretation intersectionality, the dismissal of anything written by a dead white guy as not worth reading because he must have been a racist/sexist) isn't the deeper cause of this surge in left-wing activism on campus. Rather, changes in the climate of US politics and the way kids are raised primes them to take in this ideological system. This can be changed on both ends, although I am more interested in how to change to college atmosphere and how to make these ideas (each of which has some value) more realistic and less polarizing and politically ""weaponized.""The intellectual cases put forth against all of these concepts that have crept into academia are excellent, as usual. They explain how each of these things encourages mentally and intellectually unhealthy thinking, feeds tribalism, and makes open, trusting conversation impossible on campus. Still, I thought they were getting a little loose from their moorings in their criticism of modern parenting. It is hard to tell parents to not be a little over-protective of their kids. There are ways to do this (like more unstructured time built into a kid's day, at school and at home, plus less screen time) but overall I think most parents do a pretty good job. I think they are both part of pretty elite social circles in which tiger parenting was very common. My middle class upbringing seemed to have plenty of free time, and my parents let me and my brothers roam the neighborhood pretty freely. I wouldn't dismiss all of their argument about parenting, but it was probably the weak link in the book.I'd recommend this book to anyone concerned about changes on campus or anyone who has heard about Haidt and is curious. It is concise, and very qualified. As usual, Haidt's critics have misrepresented his argument left and right, so make sure you go to the source."
56,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2319320-melissa,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wonder why the young generation seems so bad at thinking? This book sheds light on what ""we"" collectively as a society have done to cause it. We've taught three falsehoods as truth: That individuals are fragile, that we can trust our feelings, that life is a battle between good and bad people. Do you feel, like me, that there is no way you're going to write down your thoughts on a particular topic esp. publicly, because no matter how well reasoned or how good your intentions, if you use one wrong word, you're deemed evil for life by one side or the other? (You're ""cancelled."") We've hearkened back to the time of witch hunts, and I found that chapter of the history of what leads to the eras of witch hunts (which we're in a time of those right now) enlightening about why the heck one word in a well meant email can cause a person's complete ruin. We need to get back to a time where we give people the benefit of the doubt! The information on Cognitive Behavior Therapy was also enlightening. As a society, we are essentially going against good psychological practice and teaching bad ways of thinking. One of my sons is a doomsday thinker and I'm happy to have some of these CBT tools to see if I can help him stop the negative thinking habits of thinking the worst about everything and everybody. We see this reflected in society right now, everyone jumps to conclusions on a story that's not an hour old with nothing but a headline and decide they have the ability to be judge, jury, and executioner on that alone and then move on as if ruining that person's life was not a weighty matter. I don't want my son growing up to be like that and it's been frustrating to try to talk him out of his thought processes because I want him to grown up sound of mind unlike many people I've encountered lately, and I've wondered why it is they can be such bad thinkers, and this book enlightens on that some of the reasons.The practical application section is worth the price of the read on what we can do to turn the boat around. Thankfully, I've been already doing a lot of the suggestions for my kids in my determination to have them grow up sound of mind, but this was nice to have the facts and stats to help solidify what I'm doing to help. This is another book that shows our overly scheduled, screen-heavy existence is doing nothing good for our youth. The authors of this book reveal toward the end of the book what their political leanings are and they're nearly the opposite of mine, but I'd say there is no slant, because I agreed with nearly all of it, it was logical, reasoned, well laid out--we're facing a problem that affects both sides of the political spectrum. It is a bit of a slog at the beginning with all the research and the fact that they are very academic writers with the ""I'll tell you this, I'm telling you, and now I'll summarize what I just told you"" which probably is all right if you're one to read at leisure instead of read books from cover to cover like me, that would help you remember what you read if you put it down for any amount of time, but be forewarned that it isn't a fast paced read. But it's an excellent read."

Call-out culture needs to be better defined. Does #metoo movement count as call-out culture in the author's opinion? Jonathan Haidt calls himself a centralist. Yes the majority of the criticism in the book is aimed towards the political left. The author explains it is because American universities (the scope of this book) are left-leaning, and he does admit the right has bigger problem and more violent in general. I'd say his limited criticism to the right is not an intentional bias.Some discussions: - Intent vs Impact- Equal outcome vs Equal opportunity- Common Enemy Identity vs Common Humanity Identity- Make kids fit for the road, instead of demanding the road to be fit the kids- What doesn't kill you makes stronger or weaker?- One's own feeling is a bad guide for one's judgement. Question: is the drop of children abduction crime rate actually a consequence of parenting style change?"

The authors stick to supportable facts, which I really enjoy. No gaslighting here. If you are weary of modern politics, the middle of this book is a little annoying. However, the end makes it worthwhile. The authors do a great job of wrapping up their research and drawing conclusions. They make recommendations to individuals, teachers, and administrators in straightforward language. Overall, I came out of it feeling good that I know more than I did before I read it. "

60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7258380-dan-graser,Rating 5 out of 5,"This collaboration between Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt is fantastic on many levels and addresses a thorny issue with precision, honesty, and language that is free of the usual superficial pejoratives found in such discussions. They begin with three fundamental Untruths that they have distilled from their own experiences working in academia and social psychology:1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2) Always trust your feelings.3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people.These ideas are discussed in the context of current political divides, campus culture, parenting, and general discourse on social media. Throughout, they use 6 ""explanatory threads"" to understand how we have gotten where we are, sociologically and politically:1) There has been a steady increase in affective polarization since the 1980's, such that people don't feel a stronger kinship with their party but bond more over hatred of the opposition.2) There has been a nation-wide rise in adolescent anxiety and depression since 2011, mainly affecting those who belong to the ""iGen"" or Generation Z.3) There has been a shift, starting in the 80's and reaching a peak in the 90's among more educated families especially, to fearful and needlessly overprotective ""paranoid parenting.""4) The steady decline of unsupervised free play among children due to the above trend. 5) The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of over-protection of students who themselves, don't wish it or need it, resulting in the transmission of the very type of psychological issues the campus is trying to prevent. 6) The rise of social justice activism, rightfully, in response to turbulent and emotionally powerful political events between 2012 and 2018.As someone who works in academia and is genuinely concerned about students' well-being, I always enjoy reading works that provide data, facts, and arguments based in psychology to suggest how we can improve that mission while dealing with the issues present in the larger social-political context, with which our students are dealing. This book contains the finest discussion of this I have seen in addition to great, level-headed discussions of modern parenting, social justice activism, and identity politics. Well worth your time!"

But does that make for a rape culture? It seems an idea worthy of debate.” And proceed to decry safe spaces.The theory of this book is decrying the coddled mind, when many examples are the imperfect push and pull of marginalized groups getting a toehold on respect, resources, etc.Here are things they attempt to undermine in the book:- rape culture- safe spaces- therapy- microaggressions- the canceling of milo ySure some things like the word “trauma” become trendy (although the DSM definition of PTSD hasn’t changed) but this just the authors using cherry picked examples and misquotes to support their own self-narrative.

65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5884823-luis,Rating 5 out of 5,"A base de repasar algunos extraños comportamientos ocurridos en las universidades estadounidenses durante la última década, los autores deciden realizar una investigación profunda sobre las causas que están llevando a esas irracionales protestas del alumnado. Primero realizaron un artículo en el que apuntaban a que la causa podría estar en que la generación que estudia ahora en las universidades había sido excesivamente mimada en su niñez y adolescencia, el cual fue la base para realizar este ensayo.Sin duda, el planteamiento que realizan los autores puede descolocar mucho. ¿Realmente estas protestas surgen porque esos universitarios tuvieron demasiadas clases extraescolares, jugaron muy poco al aire libre o estuvieron demasiado tiempo enfrente de una pantalla? Sin embargo, el planteamiento resulta convincente en cuanto a que los autores consiguen demostrar que las conductas de intolerancia y reacción excesiva encajan con que la mente de muchos individuos puede haber asimilado las llamadas tres grandes falsedades: ""Lo que no te mata te hace más débil"", ""Siempre confía en tus sentimientos"" y ""La vida es una batalla entre buenos y malos"". Si a ese se le suma una falta de espíritu crítico y empatía por entender al otro y una preocupación constante por sentirse emocionalmente estable, quizás el argumento inicial no esté tan mal calibrado. La falta de situaciones que conllevan exponerse a un riesgo tanto físico como emocional y la abundancia de algoritmos en las redes sociales bien pueden llevar a muchas personas a sentirse cada vez más desprotegidas frente a los discursos opuestos.La verdad sea dicha, me ha gustado mucho. De hecho, mucho más que el libro previo de Haidt, La mente de los justos, al que considero mucho más teórico y abstracto. En este volumen encuentro que hay una investigación más audaz y un reto intelectual bárbaro en intentar unir cuestiones aparentemente lejanas que, aunque suene paradójico, están en la mente de cualquier persona con sentido común. ¿Cómo no van a predisponer las redes sociales a aumentar vertiginosamente los casos de depresión y ansidedad? ¿Se puede asegurar que un niño tendrá una vida adulta plena si en su infancia no disfrutó suficientemente del juego libre? ¿Una universidad cada vez más burocratizada y pendiente del bienestar de sus alumnos es realmente una buena institución educativa? ¿Es una buena justicia la que solo pide resultados sin considerar los esfuerzos?Leer este libro es encontrar que hay muchas cosas que se han empezado a hacer mal, con la complicidad creciente de padres, profesores y administradores que pensaban que estaban haciendo lo mejor para todos. Uno podrá mostrarse extrañado con las ideas aparentemente locas de Lenore Skenazy (apodada ""la peor madre del mundo"", pero que quizás es una madre simplemente convencional que asume que su hijo tiene que correr riesgos) y estará después en buena vía para entender el completo análisis de la iGen que realiza Jean Twenge a la hora de estudiar la fragilidad de la primera generación que crece con Internet. Los autores también pasan al terreno práctico dirigiendo organizaciones que median en los conflictos universitarios que el libro detalla, e incluso proponen varias buenas ideas para enderezar la situación actual."
66,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31910342-josh,Rating 3 out of 5,"I previously read Lukianoff's ""Unlearning Liberty"" earlier this year. While I thoroughly enjoyed that work, I was somewhat disappointed by this joint venture with social psychologist Jonathan Haidt. This is partly because while ""Unlearning Liberty"" was a searching examination of how higher education in recent years has failed in its central purpose to discover ""truth"" by prohibiting many forms of offensive speech on campus, this book tries to further that inquiry in some ways by putting together a composite of factors for why ""iGen"" (those who were born c. 1996) have embraced ""safetyism"" on college campuses. ""Safetyism"" is essentially the conflation of being offended with being in physical danger. The book is divided into three parts. The first unpacks what the authors call the ""three great untruths"" that iGen embraces: the world is divided between distinctly ""good"" people and wholly ""bad"" people; trust your feelings (i.e. emotional reasoning over logic); and ""safetyism"" which the authors describe as ""what doesn't hurt you, makes you weaker."" The second narrates a series of recent episodes of censorship and both far left/far right violence on college campuses, such as Berkeley Antifa protests against Milo Yiannopolis, the Alt-Right protests at UVA; and the Charles Murray episode at Middlebury. The final part explains what the authors believe are the six contributing factors that are the ""bad ideas [that] are setting up a generation for failure."" The last two chapters in this section deal with a) how parents should ideally raise children to be thick-skinned and critically thinking adults and b) how primary and secondary education can offer adolescents and teenagers the mental toolset to confront offensive ideas and grow intellectually from such debates. There is a lot of ground to cover in any review of this book (and much of what follows in this paragraph I explain in more detail in my review of Unlearning Liberty). But, the gist is that colleges and universities should be wholly focused on discerning ""truth."" Various public intellectuals, such as Van Jones, have argued that colleges provide people with a rare opportunity to grapple with offensive ideas and speech by using reasoning and argument. College should be a ""gym,"" to borrow from Van Jones, that trains people to debate and compromise within our democratic system. Since the early 2010s, though, many colleges (and almost exclusively the most liberal ones) have become distracted from the goal of seeking ""truth"" by protecting students from potentially offensive speech. There's an appropriate discussion within this section of how the left has stretched the definition of ""violence"" to include intuitively nonviolent actions, such as speech. By construing offensive speech as ""violent,"" college administrators, faculty, and students have effectively nullified the free speech privileges of a wide swathe of conservative intellectuals (and alt-right wackos) by appealing to the need to keep students ""safe"" on campus. The six factors that have contributed to the current climate of ""Safetyism,"" censorship, and unrest are best summed up as follows:1) American politics have become increasingly polarized (entering a ""polarization cycle"") where very little compromise is ever reached between left and right.2) The advent of social media and the internet has made ""iGen"" far more depressed and anxious than previous generations. 3) Parents since the 1980s have increasingly become ""helicopter"" parents, not allowing their children to experience any discomfort and sheltering them from the real world, so to speak. 4) What the authors term the ""decline of [free] play."" In other words, children have far less time relative to previous generations to socialize, initiate play, and be creative. This is caused by the fact that elite colleges and universities select from those with an abundance of extracurriculars (etc.) and parents respond by over-structuring their children's time with various activities. 5) Primary and secondary education have become obsessed with keeping students ""safe"" from offensive ideas and taboo subjects. 6) ""Social justice"" and its quest for equal outcomes has created a ""common enemy identity politics"" focused on subdividing people into various ""intersectional"" identities. The authors compare this to Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""common humanity"" identity politics that sought to authentically include all Americans in the civil rights movement by appealing to the American civic religion. These six factors (covered in six chapters) are unevenly persuasive, although I generally agree with the authors that the cult of ""safe spaces"" and ""free speech zones"" on campuses is extremely problematic. I think I agree with some of the other reviews on Goodreads that some of their solutions contain assumptions grounded in a middle-class ethos. Specifically, their idea that children should be given more rein to explore their neighborhoods, talk to strangers, and even use public transportation at young ages (i.e. nine years old). The authors argue that our perception of danger is massively inflated by the 24 hour news cycle and John Walsh's crusade to catch ""America's Most Wanted."" I agree in part, but would argue that many parents (and single parents) living in certain rural or urban areas with high crime rates have legitimate concerns about allowing their children to be ""free range children."" Being a parent myself, I generally found their Dr. Spock parental advice annoying, at best, and naive at worst. Overall, an informative book that resonated well with my experience on campus the past seven years. Excepting the final two concluding chapters, I completely recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in learning more about what is happening on America's college campuses. But you should first read ""Unlearning Liberty."" "

(I sometimes accept the title of ""Elder Millenial,"" but for the most part have trouble relating to those born after 1996.) I picked up this book because I'd noticed a perplexing--sometimes extreme--fragility in some younger millennial and Gen-Y acquaintances, and have been seeking an explanation for this--largely out of concern for what appears to be a corresponding decline in mental health.The authors both lean left of center politically, by their own admission. But this actually adds a lot of credence to their critique and observation of what is essentially an extreme left ideology underpinning this phenomenon. They are SO painfully polite and delicate about presenting their case, padding words to the point where they refer to distorted and toxic ways of thinking as believing ""Untruths""--rather than the more direct and obvious choice: LIES. And so it seems they are legitimately attempting to appeal to the very generation and subgroup that's sparked their concern over the future of free speech.“Free speech and the ability to tolerate offense are the hallmarks of a free and open society.” The Three Untruths: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: ""What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.""2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: ""Always trust your feelings.""3. The Untruth of Us vs. Them: ""Life is a battle between good people and evil people.""The authors point out that these three ""untruths,"" when embraced by students and then reinforced by well-meaning parents and/or overly accomodating University faculty, work as a sort of reverse CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)--rewiring the brain for maladaptive frailty and higher susceptibility to cognative distortions. Which, of course, results in increased anxiety and depression.The 3 criteria for an Untruth: • Contradicts ancient wisdom. • Contradicts modern psychological research on well-being. • Harms the individuals and communities who embrace it.The authors identify six contributing factors they believe have given rise to this culture of ""safetyism,"" each of which receives its own chapter. 1. Escalating political polarization (campuses shifting leftward and increasingly distrusted by those on the right.)2. An increase in adolescent anxiety and depression beginning in 2011, significantly correlating to smartphone usage/screen time/social media. 3. Paranoid parenting resulting in far less unsupervised play and greater fears of abduction (though rates for this crime have dropped).4. The decline of free play + the rise of focus on test preparation.5. The expansion of a safetyism bureaucracy at universities--driven by federal mandates, risks of lawsuits, and consumerist mentality.6. The quest for justice, evoked by events between 2012 and 2018 that sometimes focuses on ""equal outcomes social justice"" (in which any demographic disparity is assumed to be the result of discrimination, and any alternative explanations are considered discriminatory.)There are times this book does drag on a bit, and perhaps begins to feel like an overstuffed essay. But they did include a number of accounts I hadn't heard anything about, and their course correction suggestions are both needed and valid. Favorite Quote:""Argue as if you're right, but listen as if you're wrong (and be willing to change your mind). Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person's perspective. Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you've learned from them."""

Second, I appreciated the amount of research done and presented to support the arguments and how they are structured throughout the book. The authors’ present an idea, or a thesis, give anecdotes to highlight it, provide data and research to support it, offer advice on how to combat it, and then recap it all before moving to the next argument. Nice. Third, I appreciated the tone. This isn’t a book about blaming anyone, it’s a book that’s sharing and illustrating specific societal concerns and trying to encourage better interpersonal relations. I think it practices what it preaches.The main thrust of the arguments here are built around what the authors’ label ‘the three great untruths,’ which are: fragility, emotional reasoning, us vs. them mentality. They go into great detail to examine each of these tenets, explaining how and why they’ve become issues, anecdotal examples demonstrating the issues, research and statistics that support their arguments, and potential ways to lessen their impact.This book covers a wide range of topics including: overprotective parents, the effects of social media and too much screentime, the benefits of outdoor play, victim mentality, the struggle with free speech on modern college campuses, and many others.I’ve read quite a few other perspectives on this book. Some complain that the book is repetitive and drawn out, and that it should have remained an article. I think there’s some truth to this. If the arguments they are presenting don’t resonate, chances are this book will wear on you. Another complaint is that the book is narrow minded and only applies to a specific niche of Americans. This I don’t agree with at all. While many of the arguments might use anecdotal evidence from niche elements of American society, I think the broader arguments presented here are important, interesting, and worth reading even if you don’t agree. I don’t even live in America and haven’t in years. I have no interest in politics whatsoever. But I think the message could be valuable even for the high school students I teach in Thailand. In particular, coming into contact with challenging or controversial material, or viewpoints that are contradictory to your own. I can’t stress how much I believe in these ideas as an educator. Life isn’t meant to be easy, nor is it meant to be an echo chamber. Being challenged, failing, and learning how to respond in difficult situations is part of being human, and one of the key ways we learn empathy, in my opinion.In regards to the broad appeal, all three great untruths are in effect with regards to the worldwide covid-19 situation. I think this helps to show that the arguments being presented in this book aren’t just limited to liberal college campuses. Toughening up, learning to interact civilly with people you don’t like or agree with, and focusing on making decisions based on logic and reasoning rather than emotion are values I think anyone could benefit from.Story-8, Language-9, Ideas-10, C-, Enjoyment-8, O8.6"

Wise and good men are, in my opinion, the strength of a state: much more so than riches or arms, which, under the management of ignorance and wickedness, often draw on destruction, instead of providing for the safety of a people.” -Benjamin Franklin This is a well researched book, it’s also well written. I enjoyed it very much and it kept me interested the entire time. My only beef with this here book is their misunderstanding of the alt right, white nationalist, white supremacist, and how they connect it to sites like Breitbart, Milo, Trump... I am not of the “alt right” although I voted for Obama in 2008 and Trump In 2016 and think of myself as center and patriotic and am a considerable news junkie I still don’t have a clear vision or understanding of the “alt right.” Most people don’t whether it’s Helen Lewis interviewing Jordan Peterson, CNN’s reporting and coverage of the incident in Charlottesville, or these two authors. People are utterly befuddled what the alt right is and it’s obvious as can be. Take for example the schmuck Jason Kessler who was an organizer of the unite the right rally in Charlottesville, he’s a leftist shill just like the lefts “head” for the “alt right” Richard Spencer who is a major shill, God only knows who he’s working for. And saying that Breitbart is a platform used heavy by the “alt right” haha, really? The “alt right” calls it Kikebart, it’s founder and current owners are Jews, why would anti Semitic white nationalist use a digital media news outlet run by Jews ? White Nationalist? What the hell does that mean, I am white, I am also a nationalist, so was Abe Lincoln. I am not sure what I am supposed to make of their “alt right” formula and how a guy like me who voted for Obama, watched CNN, voted for Trump watches Fox, reads Breitbart and also reads books like this somehow gets lumped into the “alt right.” Unfortunately I think they were looking for balance in their book and when it came to getting the right side of the isles profile they failed. They certainly did their homework for the topic at hand in the book but the little bleeps and bloops about the “alt right” and right and the conflation of the two was nauseating. Other than that the book was dope, totally worth reading and I highly recommend it."

Over the 3 months since I finished The Coddling of the American Mind I cannot believe how many times I have shared the ideas of these authors with others. This book is just so pertinent, so timely, and so important that it comes up again and again. I generally read books and move on to the next so quickly, but this one has found a permanence in my worldview. I think that makes it worthy of 5 stars.Nov 21, 2018Why are so many college students struggling with anxiety and depression? Why are so many university campuses coming up against student demands to disinvite ""dangerous"" guest speakers, to penalize professors who propone unpopular opinions, and to dismiss any who threaten their conception of safety? This very insightful book discusses 3 great untruths of the ""IGen"" (the generation born after 1994, coinciding with the ubiquity of the iPhone): The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.It shows have parents and institutions have unwittingly taught youth these untruths, and have - with the best of intentions - coddled them to the point of handicapping their ability to handle the adult world. Within this framework, I gained some new insights into the reasons for our increasingly partisan political world.One thing I really like about The Coddling of the American Mind is that, unlike many books of this genre, it doesn't just rip down the system, telling us everything that's wrong with society, then leave us hopeless. Lukianoff and Haidt give pages of good, solid suggestions for how to correct the problems we have created. I would absolutely recommend this book to parents today, as well as to anyone in education or educational administration. It is quite bipartisan, but not afraid to point out problems on both side of the political spectrum. I already put the audiobook on hold for my husband!4.5 stars."

Kidding.This book is so relevant to the culture that we live in and the future that we are entering into. With its many different antidotes and research, the author does a fantastic job of bringing to the surface different lies (or 'Untruths' as he calls it) that have good intentions but can lead to detrimental effects overall. The stories can definitely get your blood pumping and outrage you at points and I think that's the point. 10/10 would recommend this to most people.One of the best parts of the book is the way the authors write in such a humble and transparent way. The consistently mention how the issues are more complex than they make them out to be and never claim to have the only answer. They also very openly share their political views and how they could influence their own writing when writing about political polarization. So good!"

They learned to manage their own disputes, their own groups without oversight or a Big Brother.That’s no longer the case.The teens of the sixties hated the college administrators and now Today’s teens look to those same folk to protect them.The causality seems clear."

It was validating to read from a secular source of a different political affiliation than me the same identification of major problems I see in our culture/universities/media. Some problems I’d wholeheartedly agree with include, treating children & young adults as if they are fragile, assuming the worst about people who disagree with you, elevating “safetyism” as a top goal in life, tolerating a “call-out” culture that represses legitimate criticism and intimidates/shames people, and embracing identity politics. It was refreshing to read. The authors are sometimes too optimistic about what can bring about the turning of the ship, and sometimes they are too repetitive. Overall, I’d highly recommend the book to anyone working with iGen, any school and university administrators, and parents."

The book also helped me to reexamine the educational choices that I have made for my 10 year old. I highly recommend this book, even though I didn't agree with everything that the authors had stated.

84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45596235-frank-theising,Rating 4 out of 5,"I can clearly remember watching a movie in one of my High School classes about a Jewish attorney defending the rights of American neo-Nazis to hold some sort of rally. (I had to google it, I think it was called Skokie). At the time, I remember being pissed off and confused by the film. Why would a Jewish-American defend the right of someone to speak publicly when the message being delivered was antithetical to your own way of life (or your life itself). It was a complex film, balancing the perspectives of the Jewish community who refused to remain silent (the last time their community failed to speak up they found themselves facing the holocaust) against the views of this Jewish lawyer who argued that the best strategy was to let them speak because counter-protests gave these neo-Nazis exactly what they wanted (publicity). While I have no doubt brain-dumped most of my high school education, this film and the discussion surrounding it had a pretty profound impact on me. It made me appreciate multiple perspectives on controversial subjects and the importance and value of free speech. Plus it forced me to think through how I would handle such a scenario. It was a pretty mind-expanding exercise. The Coddling of the American Mind explores the recent trend toward avoiding these types of discussions at all costs. The move to create “safe spaces” where controversial thoughts and ideas are banned so as not to make anybody ever feel any discomfort. The fact that this type of trend is occurring on college campuses, where students are supposed to have their pre-existing thoughts and beliefs challenged and where rational debate should reign supreme, is even more disturbing. The author argues that there are 3 great “untruths” that have found a home on modern college campuses:1.	Fragility – what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.2.	Emotional Reasoning (always trust your feelings)3.	Us vs Them (life is a battle between good and evil people (and you are clearly one of the good ones)).While I consider myself, classically liberal, in modern parlance I lean conservative. As most modern institutions (with a few exceptions) are dominated by the political left, this problem has been very apparent to me for some time. So in some respects the authors are preaching to the choir with me. The fact that the book was written by two (modern) “liberals” means the problem has finally become so apparent that it can no longer be ignored. The authors cover a lot of ground in this book, from helicopter parenting (safetyism), to the rampant mental health crisis among young adults (stripped of the healthy upbringing provided in conservative institutions (stable 2-parent families, church/synagogue/Mosque, etc), to modern trolls like Milo Yiannopoulos (who, similar to the Nazis in the film above, gain from and revel in the publicity from their outlandish appearances and counter protests far more than if they were permitted to make their speeches on campus in peace), to the prevalence of group think (with its penchant for sudden onset witch hunts to root out enemies), to the inability of modern educational institutions and the so called adults who run them to stand up to their own students caught up in the fury of (insert latest moral outrage or crusade). Overall, I think the authors did a commendable job of highlighting the current trends and offering solutions on how to prepare your children to overcome, despite the current environment. Would highly recommend. 4 stars."

Lukianoff and Haidt have written a book that needs to be read...by everyone! The culture of ""safetyism,"" as they call it, has gotten out of control in the US and people are so easily offended that everyone is always looking for a fight. The authors define coddling as ""to treat with extreme or excessive care or kindness."" People should not feel the need to constantly walk on eggshells in fear that they will offend someone for saying the smallest little thing. I especially enjoyed Part 3 that went through six big drivers of how we have gotten to where we are today - 1) The polarization cycle, 2) anxiety & depression among teens, 3) paranoid parenting, 4) the decline of play, 5) the bureacracy of safetyism and 6) the quest for justice. There are an incredible amount of ""mic drops,"" here are some of my favorites...Favorite quotes:p. 23 - ""Many of the important systems in our economic and political life are like our immune systems: they require stressors and challenges in order to learn, adapt, and grow. Systems that are antifragile become rigid, weak, and inefficient when nothing challenges them or pushes them to respond vigorously.""p. 41 - ""It is not good a good idea to start by assuming the worst about people and reading their actions as uncharitably as possible. This is the distortion known as mind reading; if done habitually and negatively, it is likely to lead to despair, anxiety, and a network of damaged relationships.""p. 55 - ""One should interpret other people's statements in their best, most reasonable form, not in the worst or most offensive way possible.""p. 108 - ""Solidarity engenders trust, teamwork, and mutual aid. But it can also foster groupthink, orthodoxy, and a paralyzing fear of challenging the collective.""p. 132 - ""Negative partisanship means American politics is driven less by hope and more by the Untruth of Us Versus Them. 'They' must be stopped, at all costs.""p. 167 - ""American parenting is now wildly out of sync with the actual risk that strangers pose to children.""p. 237 - ""Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.""p. 240 - ""Learning to give and take criticism without being hurt is an essential life skill.""p. 259 - ""A community in which members hold one another accountable for using evidence to substantiate their assertions is a community that can, collectively, pursue truth in the age of outrage."""
86,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7240015-stephen,Rating 5 out of 5,"There was a time when I was a youthful idealist, full of love and hope for humanity. These days, sometimes the only guard against misanthropy in my possession is recognition that we’re all broken creatures – in the gutter, as Oscar Wilde might say. But to follow on his epigram…if some of us are looking at the stars from that gutter, what are the rest looking at? In The Coddling of the American Mind, Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt argue that a new philosophy has made itself predominant in American, and increasingly western, culture — and that it rests on three untruths, promoted in schools, by parents, and enforced by the rest of society. Not only is it driving depression and anxiety, it also foments violence in the streets. Coddling is an insightful, sometimes depressing, but ultimately hopeful look at why people have sunk to such lows in recent years, and how we can rise again to assume the dignity of human beings – and treat each other likewise. It begins with a visit to the guru of Stupid – or rather, ‘Koalemos’, as the authors open the book by recounting their visit to a guru in the Greek hinterlands who taught three things:  What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.  Always trust your feelings.  Always assume the worst about other people, for the war is divided between good and evil people. If the curious reader googles Koalemos, s/he will discover that said deity was the Greek god of stupid. The guru, as it happens, is fictional; a rhetorical invention. But his untruths are taught still – by our schools, at all levels – and increasingly encouraged throughout society, from parenting strategies to government policy. The untruths are manifestly destructive, sabotaging self-development and inculcating anxiety, depression, and paranoia. One of the authors, Greg Lukianoff, reveals far into the text that he once very nearly committed suicide; he was able to recover his mental health by learning to identify the ways his own mind was poisoning itself, through self-defeating ways of thinking. He learned to use CBT, a psychological tactic very kin to Stoic mindfulness, to break loose of his worst inclinations. The great untruths, he couldn’t help but notice, operated the same way his former destructive mental habits did.  Lukianoff and Haidt believe the initial popularity of these untruths came from an obsession for safety that overtook parents of the eighties and nineties – spurred by the crime spike of that era, and several public health crises. But overprotection can be deadly; an immune system that doesn’t get tested early on will become self-destructive later on, resulting in autoimmune disorders and rampant increases in food allergies. We are, Lukianoff and Haidt write, anti-fragile creatures: we not only find strength in resistance, we need resistance and danger if we are to grow at all. What the modern world is continuing to build for itself, however, is a world where people are expected to be completely sheltered from not only what might hurt them, but what they imagine hurts them. Somehow, we have fallen from being watchful for bad actors, and become paranoid about opinions which go against ours, or disrupt our peace of mind. We’ve become like the people in Fahrenheit 451, wanting to lose ourselves in fantasy and throwing into the fire anything that disrupts the dream.This book can be thoroughly depressing, infuriating, or otherwise dispiriting in several chapters, but never moreso when chronicling the campus riots and unrest of the 20-teens, as ‘student’ bodies rushed to de-platform or get fired anyone they disagreed with – including professors who were their ideological allies. Haidt & Lukianoff document this kind of hysterical childishness on both sides, though as one ideological bent dominates college, it pops up proportional more in this view. But Haidt & Lukianoff are not talk-show hosts or polemicists casting a mocking eye at this fracas and scoffing at them: they present it at the same time as they present figures on growing rates of suicide, depression, and mental health disorders among the young. Something is deeply wrong here. The authors then explore various contributing factors; the cult of safety being one, but supported by a maniacal obsession with college, one that often begins in kindergarten as overzealous parents try to get their little ones working on their college resumes before they’ve mastered the art of Play-Doh. Another giant problem in this mental health arena is that the present generation has been wholly reared on devices. The ramifications of obsessive screentime are still being studied, thirteen years after Steve Jobs opened that particular pandora’s box, but device usage has already been linked to growing rates of depression, as people’s doting on social media timelines convinces them that they’re not as popular, and their lives not as good, as the peers around them. Is there a way out of this? Lukianoff & Haidt hope so. They note that some of the masters of social media are pretending to care about their products’ role in damaging mental health and fomenting radicalization, and there are growing enclaves of people who realize how unsustainable giving into childish mobs on campuses every other week is – who realize that the purpose of a university is to push young people to become more than they are, to refine their dross – not to patronize their worse impulses. There are parents, too, who realize children need freedom to grow….that exercising autonomy is a necessary experience. Unfortunately, parents in this regard have to work in tandem with local governments, since there exist cretins masquerading as humans who will call the police if they see a child playing outside on her own. Ultimately, Haidt and Lukianoff write, Americans need to restore the culture of dignity over the culture of victimhood – to push for social justice along common identity, not common enemy, lines. Treat a man as your enemy and he will become one. The Coddling of the American Mind is a most helpful book, helping readers understand the chaos around us without dismissing its participants as universal bad actors. Much of what has happened, what continues to happen, is driven by people with the best of intentions – but good intentions count for little when the consequences are quite this bad. Although it’s not as eye-opening and insightful as The Righteous Mind, Haidt’s previous work, it’s not too far from its neighborhood. It is especially relevant into today’s hysteria over COVID and racially-linked police deaths, as people tar and feather those whose opinions differ from their own. We can have calm discussions on the efficacy of masks, or on the nature of death-by-cops, or we can scream “YOU JUST WANT PEOPLE TO DIE” at each other. One course is more helpful."

I'd also read their Atlantic article on this topic. I'm not usually a fan of articles turned into books, and was expecting to read a lot of things that I'd already heard before. But there's actually a *lot* packed into this book. There's a great chapter here that nicely summarizes some of the more notable campus crises of the Evergreen State/Berkeley Riot variety. There's a very good chapter on recent increases in teen anxiety and depression. There's a pair of excellent chapters on the dangers of overparenting and the importance of free play. And there's a lot of good insights into ""anti fragility"" and the need for children and young adults to be able to grow from challenging experiences. I'd love to get a copy of this book into every college administrator's hands. It's a very readable, very wise, and very important book."
88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28150980-mallory,Rating 4 out of 5,"HUTCHINGS BOOK CLUB MARCH 2023*Slightly rounded up, closer to 4.5If I had read this book in 2018 when it came out, my opinion of it would have been completely different. With the past five years of context between its publishing and now, I think the research in this book and many (not all) of the authors’ points have been strengthened with the distance. I do think good things with good intentions can always be driven too far in one direction to no longer be helpful— especially if dialogue and conversations are squelched in the process. Being a current college instructor and a former high school teacher, I have spent almost a decade educating Gen Z students and much of the critiques and concerns mentioned here have mirrored my own experiences and feelings. I loved the pieces about how society and parenting practices have (d)evolved into such an emphasis on safety that independence and resilience have been perilously lost. I didn’t expect to reflect on my parenting in this book, but that was another positive element! As mentioned, I didn’t agree with all the points, but I loved listening to it and questioning my own perspectives from 2018 until now and many of the thoughts presented have stayed with me. Books backed by research that make the readers think and question their own beliefs are winners to me, even if all points don’t personally resonate. "

92,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70965168-youp,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Coddling of the American Mind is absolutely superb. It's engaging, thought-provoking, clear-cut and complete. One of the best books I've ever read.The premise of 'The Coddling' is that we're experiencing a significant shift in culture regarding raising and educating children. It is a shift towards keeping them more safe and sheltered, not only from physical dangers but increasingly from ideas and opposing views. However well-intended by parents, politicians and teachers, the phenomenon of 'safetyism' is ultimately doing more harm than good, setting up new generations for a future of failure. We would be wise to abandon these ideas altogether in favor of parenting and teaching styles that result in more resilient and able minded (young) adults.'The Coddling' is incredibly well-written and persuasive, but what makes it stand out are its structure and conciseness. The book can be divided into four major parts, each logically following the other. The first part is dedicated to describing the phenomenon of safetyism, and proving it actually exists. It answers questions such as 'what is exactly happening?' and 'how much is it happening?'. The following chapter makes a case for why it is bad to be happening, and how bad it could get in the future. Next, it gives likely explanations to explain 'how could this happen?'. Lastly, the authors provide solutions to the problem to tell us 'how can we solve this and prevent worse from happening?'. Each part is subdivided into smaller chapters, always properly introducing and summarizing, perfectly encasing its contents within the framework of said section. It's almost impossible to not follow the contents when the structure is so solid, even when listening to the book on tape.Secondly, the authors did an amazing job of being as concise as possible. 'The Coddling' is not a quick read, yet not a word is too much (or too little, for that matter). It never becomes tedious, and never leaves you longing for more examples or information. It provides the right amount of arguments; a solid combination of anecdotes, analogies, scientific data and relevance in psychology, the field of expertise of author Haidt. The style of writing is precise, explaining and defining concepts when referenced, and doesn't become pretentious or too technical even when going in depth on difficult subjects. Combined with the clear structure, it makes for an easy-to-follow book, which is quite an accomplishment for such a complex and controversial theme.It's hard for me to point out possible improvements for this book. I've read people's claims that it's too focused on the wrongdoings of the political Left, but I strongly disagree with that sentiment. 'The Coddling' gives plenty of examples on wrongs of both Left and Right, and doesn't stray too far into either territory. Some reviewers say that the subject matter is exaggerated, not being as big of a problem as the authors make it out to be. That argument only holds ground if you consider the numerous excesses, such as Evergreen College students holding teachers hostage or the rise of safe spaces and free speech restrictions, currently acceptable. To me it's perfectly obvious that we're dealing with a serious problem and potential threat for our future, and this book convinced me even more. Perhaps my critique is that the authors can be a bit too lenient on certain excesses, giving even someone who calls for white genocide the benefit of the doubt that they don't literally mean killing people. However, this is mostly me nitpicking to find some flaws, and it certainly doesn't take anything away from a nearly perfect book.The Coddling of the American Mind is a brilliant book. It's complete and concise, well-structured, persuasive yet nuanced, and grasps the reader from the very first page. Recommended to anyone with some responsibility for children, or who cares about their (and our) future."
93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,Rating 3 out of 5,"Although the authors shoot several bullseyes, the book's analysis of the phenomenon of Generation Triggered is a bit confused and scattershot. Not quite as good as I had every reason to expect. The authors undoubtedly come from a place of concern and understanding. The fine people at the Heterodox Academy have highlighted important social trends around campus speech codes, trigger warnings, emotional reasoning, identity politics, the psychopathology of (self-enforced) mental fragility, etc... This book is a testament to that worrying and often puzzling empirical reality, and the first decent attempt at exorcising its demons. The faults of the book, however, undermine the coherence and credibility of the overall analysis. The three big ones are...1) An inability or unwillingness to provide a big causal story that makes sense. Quality is replaced by quantity. Everything gets blamed from bad parenting to school administrators to academic ideologies. No doubt all of these are important trends. I just don't find the ""shotgun"" method of analysis particularly helpful in pinpointing the ROOT causes of the problem. 2) A failure to seek to understand the philosophical and moral foundations of radical egalitarianism, transgressive social norms, the discourse on power, etc... For a proper understanding, one would have to read and understand Marx, Marcuse, Foucault, Derrida, Butler, etc. This is beyond the interests of the authors. We are thus left with a muddled narrative that replaces philosophy with psycho(patho)logy. This can illuminate some important aspects of the campus madness but not unearth its parallel metaphysical foundations.3) As a consequence of the descriptive psychopathological focus, the normative emphasis on cognitive-behavioural therapy follows naturally. CBT, while worthwhile as a general tool of self-improvement, may be partially misplaced as a particular remedy to identity politics and social justice wars. It psychologizes and infantilizes one's opponents (see point #2 above), and fails to address the root causes of tribalism, moral righteousness, and extremism. Nazism was not defeated by therapy but by guns and propaganda, and the Berlin Wall required half a century to come down. CBT could not have done the job, since ideology is different from psychic illness. Not even the best of self-help advice will be able to solve the trans rights or abortion or global warming debate. Only a prolonged ethical-political debate will, which is why free speech is so important. For all its faults, the book carries an important message on how to secure free speech. In addition, it offers some uncalled for but eminently useful practical advice on how to cure combative millennials. The book lacks robustness as a coherent thesis and therefore misses the final landing by a mile. But at least it manages to take off in a bold new direction over the horizon that is bound to attract more and better equipped Amelia Earharts."

How students are demanding the classes can't contain triggering materials, to the point of making teaching certain subjects nigh-impossible. How professors can get fired because their emails contain words that are deemed not sensitive enough. Etc. I'm sure you know the phenomenon. And since what happens in America now can happen here in North Europe after a slight delay, I decided to read Lukianoff's and Haidt's book about the subject to understand the situation better - and perhaps be prepared for the rise of the campus left in my own country.The book has a brilliant structure. First the authors describe the three ""Great Untruths"" they fell the iGen have fallen prey to:1) What doesn't kill you makes your weaker2) Always trust your emotions3) The world is a fight between the Good people and the Evil people.Then they show examples of these untruths in action: basically an in expanded list of the activities of the campus left I mentioned above.By this point, the reader is shaking their head and willing to call off the whole generation. But then Lukianoff and Haidt turn the tables when they start to explore WHY the campus activists do such messed up things: they point their finger to alt-right and right-wing demagogues, who have been stirring up hate and polarization for a decade or more; helicopter parents who don't let their kids play freely, so they don't grow into responsible adults; lawmakers and administrators, who try to minimize the risks and take safety to ridiculous levels. Basically L&H say that if the kids aren't alright, it's the fault of their parents' and other members of the previous generations - so you shouldn't blame the students, but look for solutions. The last chapter is then dedicated on the possible solutions to the problems.After reading this book I'm much less worried about the campus left I was earlier. Many issues seem to be wholly American: the idea that second-grade kids wouldn't be safe walking alone to and from school is very alien to Finns. We also don't have popular far-right talk show hosts or anything similar. If Lukianoff and Haidt are right in their analysis, the situation in campuses here shouldn't become as dire as in the USA."
95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13206524-john,Rating 5 out of 5,"A very thought provoking read. Caveat, I don't believe the examples cited in the book are entirely indicative of the overall population of the younger generations (Gen Y, Gen Z). That being said, it is a raw depiction of the current status of the victim mentality and calling out that is happening in society today - and not just the aforementioned generations.In the early phase of reading I was trying to figure out if Haidt and Lukianoff lean left or right. They do a pretty thorough job of tossing stones at each side, so it is difficult to tell. No spoiler alert, they do disclose somewhere around page 180 or so. And, it is a bit of a surprise.What they do is discuss the nonsensical thinking of over-political correctness as it treads too far from reality. Further, they discuss how that has lead to the ""other side"" reacting as they have and the neo-rise of the alt-right.Also, the stories they tell of some of the incidents on campuses over the past 5 - 8 years is rather disturbing. I was actually getting a bit worked up reading these very objective stories. With an 8th grader who is already thinking about ""college"" some day, it was unsettling for a parent to read this stuff.Then, they revert back to the initial ""Three Great Untruths"" and use that as a basis of how to move forward. Their analysis doesn't ""solve"" the problem, and some other commenters have castigated the authors for this. That IS the point, you need to understand how other groups think to seek to understand, not seek to respond. I have always believed this, but this is a book that helps hammer the point home.Frankly, I think this was a great book - being rocked a bit off center is how we grow. They discuss at the end of the book the purpose of education it to find TRUTH - as many colleges have in their mottos (along with knowledge). Well, with all the homogenized worlds being created and filtered due to social media and polarized news, we need much more of TRUTH and KNOWLEDGE and seeking to understand BEFORE we react, and not just seeking to respond.I highly recommend this book if you are willing to think while reading, pausing from time to time, and applying these understandings to all the people around you. Get away from the Us vs. Them mentality being produced in the media factories we follow today. Have the courage to learn that your assertions may be not 100% right and the other side is NOT 100% wrong. Basically, have the courage to allow yourself to be wrong."

Now I can understand the problems western societies face today at a much deeper scale. Privilege and oppression, microaggression, safetyism, bigotry, hate-speech, call out culture and other important topics of everyday life are explained here in a ""though love"" way. Especially if you are far-leftwinger. ""Safetyism is the cult of safety — an obsession with eliminating threats (both real and imagined) to the point at which people become unwilling to make reasonable trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. Safetyism deprives young people of the experiences that their antifragile minds need, thereby making them more fragile, anxious, and prone to seeing themselves as victims.""""In our identitarian age, the bar for offense has been lowered considerably, which makes democratic debate more difficult—citizens are more likely to withhold their true opinions if they fear being labeled as bigoted or insensitive.""

98,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5770036-ji,Rating 3 out of 5,"Overall one of the best reads of the year. I highly recommend it to anybody who might be seeking some root-cause knowledge on how to understand the current society of American. That said, I find it a bit less exciting reading through the second half of this book (part 3 and above) compared with the earlier half. Thinking about it, it feels that the tone is a lot more definitive in the 2nd half. The authors, obviously with the best intent out there, became rather prescriptive in what fixes should happen. Obviously, their prescriptions might work. Or they might not. I think that there's no simple thinking or answer to this very complex problem - and the affective polarization is not really a contemporary American only problem, but a human society problem - for it's closely related to our basic human needs such as ""belongings"", ""group thinking"", ""feeling supported"", so on and so forth. I wish the book tried to dive a bit deeper into examples in other countries and in other era. I wish it did not end up in a way as if it was a simple problem to solve as long as people followed their prescription (which is not true, IMHO)."

They are part of a larger tradition of an older generation telling a younger generation they are not doing things right and are going to ruin America. Somehow I think the kids will be alright."

101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5630113-audrey,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was written, in a nutshell, as a response to the growing incidents of college students having meltdowns and tantrums on campus. The authors are Cognitive Behavior Therapists (and center/center-left politically) and have observed how Gen Z has been raised in exactly the opposite of Cognitive Behavior Therapy principles, leaving them emotionally and mentally weak and unprepared for adulthood. The book explores “Three Great Untruths”:– What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Weaker (Truth: Being shielded from discomfort and hardship your whole life makes you unable to function as an adult.)– Always Trust Your Feelings (Truth: Feelings often don’t reflect reality. “I can’t do anything right.” “That person looked at me, so they want to hurt me.” “If I don’t pass this test, my whole life is ruined.” These are all lies.)– Life Is a Struggle of Us Vs. Them (Truth: While it easy to put people in categories, taken to an extreme, this is dangerous for society. If you stop and talk to people with the intent to understand, you will discover you agree on a lot more than you thought you did.)Parenting shifted in the early 80s with “America’s Most Wanted” convincing parents that predators were everywhere despite it being a safer time than the 60s. The overreaction led to helicopter parenting and “Safetyism,” the belief that people must be shielded from anything that hurts them physically, mentally, and emotionally. This not only stunts growth in these areas, it is in opposition to democracy and liberty.If you don’t learn to control your feelings and recognize harmful thinking, especially catastrophizing, you are easily manipulated by others because you’re easily offended and worried what people think of you. If you seek for “microaggressions” everywhere, you are seeing people as enemies and constantly worried about what others think of you. You are always catastrophizing, and then we get this “words are literal violence” nonsense. This is terrible for mental health. I’ve met young people who don’t even believe it’s possible to control your feelings. That’s part of growing up. Related to that, society rewards victims and sees achievement as oppression. To avoid being bullied, you have to portray yourself as a victim first.One example in the book was a tweet someone wrote that said they wanted a “white genocide.” Many people were offended or appalled at such a call to violence. But when you learn what it really means, it’s something else: The tweeter was referring to the fear of white supremacists that the white race will disappear (a “genocide”) because of interracial relationships. The tweeter was poking fun at those people, not calling for mass violence. Note how we don’t communicate anymore, don’t speak the same language, and perceive each other more and more as “other” and “bad.”I feel I should offer one little correction: The book talks about Trump’s Charlottesville speech that got a lot of people riled up, but it left out part of Trump’s statement, which he repeated about three times: “There were some good people who showed up to condemn the removal of statures. I’m not talking about the white nationalists and white supremacists; those people should all be condemned.”My rant on racism: The concept of racism is so stupid, so illogical, that I don’t think it has a place on the political spectrum. (Progressives got into it with eugenics, but even now most progressives don’t go for it.) I don’t think racism fits with the term “far right.” There is nothing conservative or right-wing about racism. Conservatism believes everybody has equal value and needs equal opportunities. Everyone has personal challenges that can be overcome. No one deserves either legal favoritism nor discrimination for surface, immutable characteristics. Now, I tend to be naïve in thinking no one could be so stupid to believe in racism, and my mind has a hard time believing that racism is any serious threat to anyone because surely there aren’t that many morons among us. So I apologize if I ever appear to dismiss racism as not a big deal. Really, it’s just incomprehensible to some part of my brain.Language: MildSexual Content: Mentions of consent issues; nothing explicitViolence/Gore: Riots, protestsHarm to Animals: NoneHarm to Children: Mentions of abductions, helicopter parentingOther (Triggers): Cancel culture, false accusations, overreaction"
102,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I rarely give 5 stars to any book but this one was a standout for me. I think every parent, school administrator and teacher would benefit by reading this book right now. It's been on my to-read list for a while and I wish I had read it when it was first released 3 years ago. I actually listened to the audio version and have since bought the physical book so I can highlight and mark it and pass it on for my kids to read.I appreciated that it was a thoughtful, logical, data-based book with clear assessments and solutions. Their basis is that people have been trying to help kids and protect them and it's back firing in some ways (though not all). It's from a very positive position and recognizes that the intents have been good which I appreciated. I had a friend say she thought that reading this book would just verify her own thoughts and be like an echo chamber. I found there were some points that did agree with my previous assumptions (like the fact that we are trying to protect children way too much and it's hurting their ability to become confident adults) but I still gained from the explanation of studies done that showed why it's destructive and what it's actually doing.I gained new insights into why there is a distinct uptick in animosity on college campuses and how and why diversity there is decreasing which will lead to more problems, why depression and anxiety are skyrocketing in teens, why there has been an explosion of riots around the nation and how both Democrats and Republicans have exacerbated the problems but the roots of the anger is more likely from our feelings of tribalism rather than inclusion and from our inability to listen and debate with those who have different ideas from us without feeling personally attacked. We need to always give the benefit of the doubt! I even learned why there has been an exponential rise in peanut allergies (which I've been trying to figure out for years!). I feel like I have been shaking my head for the last few years going why, why, why? And this book gave many reasons that resonated as truths and logical causes.I truly appreciated that it ends with a list of specific ideas that we can all do to improve ourself, our kids, our communities and America as a whole. I loved the suggestions to improve mental health. I usually hate books where people tell me what to do so this was surprising to me that I loved their suggestions and wholeheartedly agreed with them.A little more than halfway through the book, when it got to a chapter about social division and would be addressing some political topics, the authors wanted to make clear their political leanings since they had already discussed how we all have biases and they wanted to be upfront. I was thrilled to learn that one generally supports the Democratic party and the other leans more to Libertarian (I think I am remembering that correctly - I listened to the book) and neither has ever voted for a Republican in any national election. Since I am much more conservative, (though I've felt partyless lately and don't like to claim Republican right now) I was thrilled because I had been nodding my head and agreeing with so much of the book already and to know that we were coming from different sides of the aisle just made me happy and confirmed to me that they were writing as logically and unbiased as possible to address this book to everyone.This is the longest review I've ever written but I was really impressed by this book and I think if everyone can recognize the causes for the effects we are already seeing then they will be motivated to make changes that will curb the trend, strengthen our children, improve colleges and we can become again a united America - still with different ideas and priorities but able to listen to each other and work together for the common good. Read this book. I don't think you will regret it."

But Coddling of the American Mind didn't click. Stuff I liked:- The three Great Untruths and their dangers: what doesn't kill you makes you weaker, always trust your feelings, life is a battle between good and evil people. - The first untruth is based on Antifragile - one of my favourite books. - Chapter 2 (""always trust your feelings"") talked about using Cognitive Behaviour Therapy techniques to analyze your thoughts and feelings for cognitive distortions. I thought this was super useful, and it's something I'll file away for the future. - It was interesting enough throughout to finish. Stuff I didn't like:- Published in 2018 and mostly covering events from 2013-2018, this felt like a book about current events that is a few years out of date. - Too focused on America... I guess I can't complain as it was in the title. - The book is about ""outrage and polarization"" (p255), particularly on university and college campuses. I find this topic exhausting, draining, and unfulfilling to read about. The whole of Part II was a catalogue of polarizing events which reminded me why I deleted Facebook (in ~2010, a decade before it was cool), and significantly dialed back on outage-prone social media in the last few years (loving the 3rd-party Twitter app Talon for it's ""muffle"" feature, and the ability to filter out keywords and hastags from your timeline). - The book as a whole, coherent argument somehow didn't click. There are some critical reviews that suggest the 2015 Atlantic article is good enough, and that a book is too much. (note, I have not read the article. No more, please!) Haidt and co-author Lukianoff had about a gentle and balanced approach as possible in discussing this topic, but I just don't have the mental stamina for outrage (news, social media) or meta-outrage (this book).

104,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,Rating 4 out of 5,"Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think. – Hanna Holborn GrayI look for books that are going to make me think, make me see things differently. Coddling of the American Mind did this. In brief, it is about three great Untruths that are affecting US universities and making them weaker: that we are protecting them from things that they see as dangerous, because – although there are good people, there are also evil ones. The great Untruths are:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. 2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. 3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. (p. 4) Lukianoff and Haidt are provocative, but also good at bringing together diverse kinds of information together to help us recognize, as the subtitle goes, ""how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure.""For a book about the dichotomous and extreme thinking characterizing parenting, students, and the university system in the 21st century, Lukianoff and Haidt slip into dichotomous thinking. As do we all from time to time.We are in an age of helicopter parenting – even bulldozer parenting – where parents attempt to intervene with their college-aged children in a way that my daughters, frustratingly, would not allow me to do when they were in grade school. Rather than helping them, except in the short-term, this sort of parenting (and overscheduling, failing to allow or encourage free play, etc.) leaves students to becoming fragile, anxious, and easily hurt. Lukianoff and Haidt argue compellingly that college students should and must be exposed to viewpoint diversity, which will help them think more critically, understand diverse perspectives, and withstand events that would otherwise make them depressed and anxious. As the authors conclude, this means that we should beseeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality). (p. 14)I appreciated Coddling of the American Mind, but I was often annoyed and irritated by it – which are not good outcomes for this time of year. Lukianoff and Haidt gathered interesting and often compelling threads, but I wasn't convinced by all of their evidence. Clearly, there is more anxiety and depression on campus than when I was in school, but that isn't necessarily a function of ""coddling,"" but of greater access on college campuses. Students who would not have been able to attend college 20 years ago can.While Lukianoff and Haidt criticize students' complaints about controversial and noncontroversial speakers (e.g., George Will, Bill Maher, Eric Holder, Madeleine Albright), I am less dismayed. I like that students are more likely to set limits about things that my generation accepted (e.g., #metoo).Current parenting practices, among many other things, have both strengths and weaknesses. Lukianoff and Haidt primarily focus on the downside here, but maybe we can look for some nuance and attempt to create a stronger model for the next generation of parents – and universities."
105,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3052770-teri,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is an important read in today's society. This book is a look at the iGen generation that seems to be obsessed with technology and social media. The authors look at how ready access to news and social media affects attitudes and higher education. iGen students seem to be obsessed with protecting themselves against any other opinion than their own. They are less open to expanding their worldview and listening to opposing views to gain a broader understanding of today's society. This has led to students feeling ""unsafe"" when dealing with someone who does not share their views. Are they truly physically unsafe or are they just unable to process opposing views? Instead of engaging in open, civil debate or listening to gain understanding, students are sheltered and professors and administrators kowtow to students, offering special ""safe spaces,"" firing faculty who simply exercise their first amendment right, or even canceling guest speakers whose views are not shared with the majority of students. In essence, the authors suggest that we are coddling America's youth and young adults, sheltering them to the point that they are unable to process opinions and ideas that they do not identify with. The authors spend a lot of time discussing how technology and social media have affected current attitudes and lifestyles. Where once young kids would go out and play in the neighborhood, without constant adult supervision, they are today being watched by helicopter parents, suggesting that kids are being overprotected. Are we coddling the younger generations to the point that they are unable to psychologically handle uncomfortable positions? It is certainly worth thinking about and this book will open that discussion to consider if we are doing a disservice to our youth.I think this is a must-read for parents, teachers, and faculty of higher education. These are the children that will one day rule our nation. How will they handle our future?"
106,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17851677-athena-lathos,Rating 4 out of 5,"Though this book contained some repetitive arguments and a few sections that were less compelling than others, it largely succeeded in providing a balanced account of the current state of mental health among American college students as well as the tendency of student activists to perceive situations as ""us versus them"" conflicts lacking ambiguity or nuance. I certainly see many of the behaviors that the authors track among both the students I work with and my leftist peers online (particularly w/r/t to their tendency to interpret the words of others without the principle of charity and to adhere to the ""untruth of fragility"").As the authors likely intended, I was surprised and sickened by some of the college campus narratives in here, especially those in which professors I perceive to be intelligent, kind, and invested in social justice are summarily rejected and harassed by activists who (paradoxically) do not seem to see these scholars as real people, but instead as one-dimensional symbols of white supremacy and queerphobia. Though the authors end up addressing many of the counterarguments that came to mind as I read the text, I wish they would have spent a bit more time on what activism when it *doesn't* embody some of the cognitive distortions and concerning groupthink that Haidt and Lukianoff point out. The authors rightly address the fact that activism plays a key role in social progress, but--from what I recall-- only briefly address 60s-era protests as examples of this. Because the internet plays an enormous role in mob mentality/the tendency to perceive everything as a violence, I would have also liked to have seen the authors discuss how discourse communities on Tumblr and Twitter influence youth activism a bit more thoroughly. Overall, though, I found The Coddling of the American Mind to be a cogent examination of a variety of serious issues impacting not just college campuses, but American society/the culture wars in general. I am grateful for the authors' capacity to treat many of the subtopics they include with respect, moderation, and (just as they preach) charity.P.S. I found the theoretical introductory anecdote set in Greece and unveiling of ""the great untruths"" pretty cringe-y, and believe the book would be better without it. "
107,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is getting lots of play these days. I think the book is generally well done and the interest in the book is well deserved. Most of my issues with the book stem not from its content but from an effort to do too much within the context of a popular book on secondary and post-secondary education. Do not get me wrong here. The parts of the book all seem on target and well presented. The problem is in how they fit together and how a general reader can get his/her mind around the different parts of the book.Where to start?Going from the title “The Coddling of the American Mind” has broad ambitions to make a statement about American intellectual life, education, social values, and the like. OK, so far so good. But the book jumps in and largely focuses on events at a small number of elite and highly competitive private liberal arts colleges and universities, with a few public universities thrown in for good measure. No claim is made that the events and trends in the book are happening at more than a small number of these schools or that these are common occurrences even within the sample. While this set of schools is obviously important, it is a small subset of American higher education. For a long time, most students who attend and complete college do so at large public institutions and most do not study the traditional “liberal arts” but instead study in fields like business, social work, nursing, and education. So what is on display here is a subset of elite education in America.So this book is a highly visible representative of the genre of “wacky stuff that is going on within America’s elite undergraduate institutions”. Recent members of this genre include Deresiewicz’s “Excellent Sheep”. People my age might remember Bloom’s “The Closing of the American Mind” or could go back to Buckley and “God and Man at Yales”. Why the interest in the elite schools? Well, their alumni certainly read a lot, but there is also some level of intellectual voyeurism at work. And then there are the parents trying to crack the code to gain entry for their kids into these schools. I do not mention this to diminish the value of the book. If anything what happens at these elite schools is of high symbolic value to the rest of American higher education and will likely remain so.Now to the book.The book is a compilation and distilling of a wide range of arguments and research streams but the basic “hook” concerns the recent increase in importance of “three great untruths” - the untruth of fragility, the untruth of emotional reasoning, and the untruth of “us versus them”. These untruths are unjustified assumptions that when incorporated into one’s thinking produce significant and counterintuitive errors of potentially significant dimensions, most notably in the shutting down of speakers and discordant viewpoints for fear of causing emotional harm to those not in agreement or the taking of actions against those holding fringe opinions as a result of their holding such opinions. The central part of the book is a discussion of these errors and of a number of highly disturbing events at various colleges in which these errors are seen as having played a part and which involved intimidation, violence and even academic “witch hunts”.The book then expands on its initial chapters by discussing the role of other stakeholder groups. Few are left out and the book covers faculty, students, administrators, the news media, social media, parents, and secondary school educators (of the college students). The book makes a specific generational claim, namely that the events and trends it chronicles — the “iGen” or “Generation Z”. Yes, this is not a book about millennials but the subsequent generation. (Let me note here that I do not view the generational argument - here or more generally - as a strength of the book and that reducing matters to the lowest demographic temporal common denominator is seldom a compelling basis for argument. The authors themselves note that the trends they cover are not found in everyone starting college - or even a majority.)The book is an outgrowth of a 2014 New Republic article that focused on explaining these disturbing and highly visible events at major institutions.I am generally persuaded that the authors have brought together a relevant set of ideas and trends and that the book is informative about what is going on in colleges today. It certainly rings true with my experience. I am less certain about the incidence and prevalence of the issues that are raised. The examples discussed are not that common although common enough to merit attention.A strength of the book is that it tries to tie together are variety of ideas and trends together and to provide a broader and better integrated perspective than is commonly presented in the popular literature on university life today. If anything, the authors attempt too much. The later chapters on helicopter parents and the demise of play are not particularly informative. The treatment of the role of university administrators in the “coddling” process is plausible and even useful and the focus in the book on universities as complex educational organizations is a valuable.There are gaps too. The book could do more to point out the contributions of professors and niche academic fields to the mess. In fairness, this is a difficult and sensitive issue and all academic work can and should be actively criticized. The authors are spot on in detailing the rise of consumerist approaches to higher education and how that contributes to pathologies. (This problem is also present in graduate professional education.) The authors say virtually nothing about the difficulties that new students have in academically adjusting to college life and how academic demands may interact with newer social demands to produce some of the bizarre behaviors mentioned in the book.Finally, in discussing what to do, it would have been helpful for the authors to explain how some schools prevent outrages from happening my maintain the rights of all to speak and enforcing codes of student behavior (and local laws). Most colleges know how to maintain order while continuing to promote academic values.Overall, these concerns are minor. As these books go, this is a good one and worth reading."

I found ""What's Our Problem"" by Tim Urban to be a more insightful read. A few points this book raised that I found unique and interesting were how the deprivation of unsupervised play and exposure to risk at a young age have affected the youngest generations, which may be part of the cause of the large spike in teenage anxiety and depression. Social media and the rise of political polarization were another two major factors at play here, which I imagine will not subside anytime soon. The prescriptions for improving were not earth shattering, but are always good to be reminded of: start with what you can control (yourself), limit time on your device/social media, practice mindfulness, and let kids play outside. Probably not a bad idea to get some outdoor time as an adult too. Favorite quotes (some not from author but quoted in book)""Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child""""Mass movements can rise and spread without belief in a God, but never without the belief in a devil""""One paradox of upper middle class American life is that some of the things parents and schools do to help kids get admitted to college may make them less able to thrive once they're there"""

They do appear to genuinely want a better future for students and academics in a world where free speech is under threat. However, in their haughty claims of distanced pragmatism, supposedly different from the moralistic and emotional actions of students and professors, they have their own problems. They have been so caught up in their view, become so absolutist in their denouncement of the modern ‘safetyism’ , that they now have their own cult - not one of safety, but one where stoicism is a righteous expectation of every individual. They liken students to delicate candles, rather than fires, neglecting the fact a student needs a degree of time and protection for that candle to BECOME a fire, especially in a new environment. I think they have some great ideas, and their emphasis of the need for freedom of speech and their advocation of CBT is very valuable. BUT, they amalgamate totally different aspects of the modern university experience: lumping together trigger warnings AND the banning of controversial speakers. To me this is neglectful and damaging, suggesting they themselves haven’t been put through enough rigorous conversation in the challenging of their ideals. "

118,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15283898-jacob,No Rating,"An interesting take, though I don't think it deserves NYT bestseller hype. Unfortunately, I think some of this book's ideas, specifically a certain negative conception of 'safetyism', could even function to work against some of the voices calling for needed changes to existing power structures by letting readers chalk legitimate calls for change up as 'safetyism.' This is one of those books where the authors are well-credentialed, articulate, Tedtalk thought leaders, and I had to remind myself not to just nod along without challenging them back. I think I agree with some of the principles in this book. I agree that we as an American culture have developed emotionally-charged attitudes towards opposing viewpoints and that can sometimes lead to unhealthy and less critical ways of thinking on both sides of political issues. I agree we need to find ways to have civil discourse on difficult moral topics between people who hold opposing viewpoints, especially on college campuses. I do think that there is a problem in the increasing use of 'us-versus-them' rhetoric. That said, I wasn't full convinced by some of the other assertions. Their commentary on 'common-humanity identity politics' as opposed to 'common-enemy identity politics' felt fair in some ways—I do think that where possible it's most effective to try to bring in a wide array of people as opposed to fomenting negativity towards a common enemy (I think that’s likely the best strategy for making change). But in politics there IS almost always a useful common enemy of a sort (perhaps not all rich straight white men, but maybe certain particular rich straight white men? or maybe better still specific immoral actions or policies and those that are making them?). In their chapter on micro-aggressions, they urge people to assume the best intentions. That's sound general advice I suppose, but there's also no reason not to raise awareness of what types of words and actions make someone feel hurt or like they don't belong. It’s still possible to do much harm even with good intentions. But it’s best for everyone if we all maintain a growth mindset, allowing for all humans to grow and learn from their missteps.They argue the words 'safety' and 'trauma' and 'violent' are being overused. 'Concept creep' they say. This assertion made me think a lot, but I came down feeling a bit differently than the authors. I think it's fair to hope that kids and adults will try to become anti-fragile, and I agree with their suggestion of cognitive behavioral therapy practices to cope instead of shielding children and ourselves from challenging viewpoints and material, but I'm still not convinced reserving these words for only physical- safety, trauma, and violence is the right approach. There are so many people whose lives are deeply affected by non-physical things, incidental or systemic, and I think these words are sometimes exactly the right way to describe those things. (Edit: Thinking and talking more about this, I realized that one negative consequence of this concept creep is that it dilutes the magnitude of certain traumas. Like if people called someone being touched briefly on the behind “rape” it starts to take something away from people who have survived rape. Maybe there are certain words that we should be more guarded about? Idk)I need to think more about callout- and cancel-culture. In my mind, there's a place for saying 'this person shouldn't be given the air time because their words/actions/viewpoints have been damaging to people in the past and may influence more damage. But this book did help me recognize how call-out culture in the university setting may be causing professors and administrators to avoid difficult, important topics on campus in order to avoid any chance of being called out. I'm sure many people feel something similar in their day to day lives. As a society we probably need to find some healthier ways of dealing with insensitivity and/or ignorance than mass public shaming and calls for dismissal. Lastly, I agree with their views that kids should probably grow up with more unstructured time and that the arms race to college admissions prep has been detrimental to children generally. But tbh what do I really know about kids?"

120,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32065747-megan-reilly,Rating 1 out of 5,"This book was recommended to me and I'm grateful for the recommendation. I actually agree with quite a few of the points the writers put forth; however, when it came to the chapter on college sports and Title IX, the writers are simply mischaracterizing what the real problem is. Equal outcomes does not mean everyone gets a rowing team - it means everyone gets a number of scholarships, and normally one team (i.e. men's football) sucks up a huge percentage of those scholarships, which means two things happen: one, women's teams are created in order to create new scholarships for women, and two, men's teams are cut in order to avoid cutting scholarships from the football team. The outcome is scholarships, not funded teams. The actual thing that is keeping the men from having their rowing team is the men's football team in this case, because the school won't ever cut anything from something that brings in that much money.So, if they are mischaracterizing the problem in that chapter, then I simply can't trust that they aren't doing the same elsewhere, including the places where I agreed. Additionally, the writers have a tendency to come up with a hypothesis that sounds real good, but then only give examples that benefit one ""side"" of the debate. They will later throw in terms to seemingly satisfy ""both sides,"" but they aren't actually doing that in the analysis. Further, they go on to make recommendations to schools and colleges that go so far as to suggest curriculum that is found on their website. Most of which is what has been cut from high schools (humanities, literature, civics) in order to fund STEM education. There are mentions of the stoics and Aristotle - why not teach their writings? Surely they knew how to debate rationally, how to do so without allowing emotions to take over. Instead of a curriculum based on their writings, though, they suggest people who are founding organizations today, and I can't help but wonder if there are other motivations to those orgs.One of the two writers of the book is the leader of FIRE, an organization that has taken funding from the Koch brothers. One of the Koch's goals is ""school choice,"" which takes money away from public education. The other point that this book fails to explore entirely is that while college campuses are definitely where students have been successful at shouting down speakers and ideas of a conservative bent, the universities as a whole are incredibly conservative institutions, and anyone working in one as faculty will tell you (especially those who are not white able-bodied men). Think of this book this way: it's a book about how to prepare for and survive plane crashes, and you will read about every plane crash you've ever heard about in the news. But you won't read about the planes that don't crash, because writing about them doesn't support the writer's hypotheses. If you don't spend any time on college campuses, and you just hear about them on the news, then yes, you will likely agree that this is what they're like. But, if you're there every day, and you spend your life with these students, you will understand just how far off this book is in its depiction of reality. Yes, some colleges have had issues with speakers being protested - some. Yes, students have jumped to conclusions without reading the entire history behind an issue or a case - I'm shocked, really. But this is hardly the first time in American history that college students have done things that made the news. I have had only 1-2 students in the five years I've been a professor actually be what the writers call too ""fragile"" to handle the material. They're actually quite strong and much of their desire for ""safety"" is due to having gone through active shooter drills their whole lives or a greater awareness of sexual assault than we had (as well as experience of it), AND out of a great deal of empathy for each other. It's not all about helicopter parenting and over-testing. Some of it is a genuine desire to change the world."

123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28916766-mark-schleier,Rating 5 out of 5,"Yeah... This is a good book... Haidt broke this book into some very interesting and thoughtful sections, that were largely based on 3 untruths that are circulating the world/our society right now: 1. The Untruth of Fragility: What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Weaker2.The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always Trust Your Feelings3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life Is a Battle Between Good People and Evil PeopleThese are each incredibly rich concepts, and I couldn't help but agree on nearly every aspect of this book's premise. This year (2020) being a very challenging year politically, socially, and physically, each of these 3 untruths couldn't be more obvious. I loved how Haidt unpacked each of these points, but then spoke to great lengths on what we can do to correct them. The sad part is how strongly these untruths are being fanned into flames, and how politicians (on all sides), social justice leaders (on all sides), and influences are levering the power of these untruths in such a way that it's actually going to break society, not fix it. Here's a summary on what I took away on how we should address each untruth: 1. As safely as possible (assuming risks) we must pursue and put ourselves and our children in tough and challenging circumstances. This is the only way we grow. Allowing the cultural movement of safety-ism to remove hardship and reduce the chances of harm is not an acceptable excuse to not allow ourselves to be exposed to tough situations. This includes listening to viewpoints that differ from ourselves. 2. We should always challenge our thoughts, our feelings, and apply a level of cognitive humility to ourselves in the sense that none of us have exactly right the perception of reality. We're all distorted in some ways, and we need to constantly check ourselves, while being open to others. 3. Just because someone has a different perspective or opinion, even if you strongly disagree or even condemn their thinking, doesn't justify viewing them as inherently evil. We must pursue things that unify us; not things that divide us; split us up; or force tribalism (which is mostly what we're doing today in our society). I think the 2020 story here would be the battle between police reform and social justice/black lives matter and blue lives matter with fighting for traditional western familial values. Why does this have to be us vs. them? Why cant we, as a society, pursue both subjects... Why does it have to be all or nothing for each side (at least from a media narrative perspective)? Book rating criteria; to help objectify my ratings.1. Will I read it again?Yes, yes, and yes... Seriously rich and powerful book. 2. Would I recommend this to others?Yes, yes, and yes.... Anyone who has opinions that others disagree with occasionally (that should pretty much mean all humans...), anyone who's parenting, anyone who's a student, anyone who lives in a democracy, and anyone who wants to be more informed on macro social and political movements... Read this... 3. Am I smarter, better or wiser as a result of this book?Yes, absolutely. Both as a parent and a citizen of a democratic society. 4. Was I entertained while reading this/it kept my attention?Yes, super interesting content and the author was very engaging. 5. This book was just the right length?Yes, just right. "

125,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25113404-liz,Rating 3 out of 5,"This one is a difficult one to review...On the one hand, I agreed with many of the points the authors made about fostering resiliency in children and adults, facing and handling opinions that are different that your own, and learning to live in a world where you will have to deal with people who won't always have your best interests in mind. On the other hand, I feel like the bigger issues of safe spaces, microaggressions, hate speech/rhetoric, and racism/classism/sexism are a lot more nuanced than they are given credit for here. In fact, the advice they give is more blanket advice, and often doesn't factor in how racism/classism/sexism play a role in development, safety, and perceived cultural status and privilege. I remember reading the original article published in the Atlantic back in 2016 and agreeing with a lot of it. The authors comment about how a ""movement"" on college campuses towards protective actions against triggering topics, rejection of controversial speakers, and the insurgence of complaints against professors and administration was surfacing in 2013. However, the cultural climate has changed quite a bit since 2016. Horrible instances of racism in academia, far right groups using the umbrella of free speech to justify inciting violence at rallies, and systemic issues with privilege and equity coming to light makes this argument a lot more gray than the black and white sides often presented here.  I agree with a lot of their assessments - i.e. the slippery slope of free speech crossing over with hate speech, banning speakers from campuses, ""preparing the child for the road, not the road for the child."" However, much of these issues and advice did not often take into account issues beyond how the coddling of the youth turns into the situations we see today on college campuses. And again, while I did agree with a lot of their points, there was a big gap between the over-protection of children and the acknowledgement of how privilege, race, and prejudices factor into the equation, in both childhood and adulthood. I really enjoyed the first half that discussed these issues in academia and wanted to hear more about it. I'm trying to read more books from both sides of this issue so that I can better form my own opinion. But it is hard to get a well-rounded view of this topic because it's still actively unfolding all over, and because it tends to be something that people have strong opinions on, which will always turn into a bias in their writing. While the sections on the coddling of children (see Free-Range Kids: Giving Our Children the Freedom We Had Without Going Nuts with Worry for more), CBT tips, and the Great Untruths were informative, I was less interested in these pieces. And while I understand their importance for building the ultimate argument of the book, it felt more like a few bloated essays tacked onto the end of a topic that could constitute an entire book on its own. "
126,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50751040-jasper-burns,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is one for its time, although I’m afraid those who need to read it most are the ones least likely to do so. The authors touch on several of the flashpoints of this decade, from the rise of tribal thinking, screen usage, safe spaces, college fragility, to overprotective parenting, and they tie them together to explain how these are setting iGen (the generation following millennials) up for failure. Rather than making a moral argument as many do, what makes this book interesting is the argument from psychology. There are a dozen or so cognitive distortions they introduce which really help to understand and analyze society. For example, 'emotional reasoning' is letting your feelings guide your interpretation of reality (""I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out."") 'Catastrophizing' is focusing on the worst possible outcome and seeing it as most likely, 'negative filtering' is focusing almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. They consistently tie how these different behaviors and more can induce depression and social panic, and they seek to apply cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) methods to diagnose and cure the pains of both political correctness and depression. These methods were made more poignant when one of the authors, Greg Lukianoff, discussed when he was suicidal and how these CBT methods saved him. These cognitive distortions, they convincingly argue, are weakening an entire generation. They are the ingredients causing the moral and psychological panics nationwide.Format-wise, I thought it odd that the first chapters told a fictional Greek fable in order to introduce their “Three Great Untruths” about modern society, but after that, the rest of the book was excellent and devoid of similar gimmicks. I really appreciate how the authors summarized each section in bullet points at the end of each chapter—someone could read all those bullet points and understand their entire argument. All the filler information for the chapters was interesting and useful too though, and I learned a fair bit more about some of the college protests, the philosophy of free-range parenting, and more.For those who consider themselves progressive or politically correct, please read this book. It will not offend you, it's written in a positive and uncontroversial language by two well-known liberals. If you consider yourself open-minded and willing to admit that there may be a psychological issue with safe spaces and social protectionism generally, it may surprise you to find how deep those problems go. For those who are classically liberal or conservative, you will be nodding your head in agreement for much of the book. Either way, the acuity of the psychological analysis is sharp and worthwhile for everyone. Highly recommend.View my best reviews and a collection of mental models at jasperburns.blog."

The authors appear to have an opinion, and then support that opinion with well-selected news stories rather than big data. Occasionally the authors do include big data, but not enough of it to bolster their arguments. Particularly aggravating was their continual tactic of stating more than one possible interpretation of data, yet then using examples that only support one argument. This gives the appearance of them trying to ""cover their tracks"" so to speak, so that potential critics could be silenced. One example of this is their opinion that an overwhelming amount of depression cases can be treated with CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy); in other words, people who are depressed can think their way out of it. Although, in one or two lines, they that vaguely reference the fact that depression is a chemical imbalance, their entire point is that depression has risen because kids believe one or more of three lies. The authors have a lot of good points, but come across as fatalistic with a strong tendency towards nostalgia. Overall, the authors have the opinion that campuses are liberal hot-spots and that ""kids these days"" are less equipped to think for themselves - which is not fact based although it may seem correct in some instances. As a college professor myself, there are a lot of criticisms raised that I do agree with, but the overall leaning of the book towards the concept that campuses are part of the problem is misguided and does not take into account many other socio-cultural factors. In addition, they make broad generalizations and support those generalizations with news stories that tend to be the exception, not the rule.In the second half of the book the authors start to explain where they fall on the political spectrum, saying that they've ""never voted for a Republican president"" etc. The fact that they feel the need to include this further shows that their arguments are not purely fact-based, rather they are politically biased. If the book truly was non-partisan and fact-based, then there would be no need for the authors to defend their personal political views. It came across as the authors attempting to defend themselves and seemed inappropriate in the kind of book they were trying to write. However, if they were successful in their attempts they would not need to start talking about who they did or did not vote for.I do recommend reading this book, but read it critically and with eye towards the structure of their arguments and not the emotional appeal towards the good ole days."

It is a polarizing, love it or hate it sort of book. But I found some of it valuable, and the rest of it well worthy of critique. I am wholly onboard with the concept that education should not be comfortable. I am fully supportive of the right of people to say whatever the hell stupid thing they want to say, unless you are endangering others. And I agree that that danger should mean actual, physical danger, not just hurting someone’s feelings. Unexamined ideas are not strong. Real learning is squirmy and awkward and sometimes downright painful. It should be. We should be able to pick apart every idea we have and ask ourselves WHY. Why do I believe this? And a college campus should actively encourage that. It should make you hear things you don’t agree with. We have come to the incorrect conclusion lately that listening somehow implies support. It doesn’t. I listen to all sorts of shit that I disagree with. My main issue with this book is its “evidence” claims. Anecdotes do not equal evidence. One of the main concepts of this book is that is something goes against “ancient wisdom” is is inherently untrue.NO. NO. NO. Am I being clear enough here? NO. Just because an idea is old, it does not mean it is true. That, my friends, is bullshit. There are a bunch of old ideas that are terrible and horrible and dangerous. I do not agree with some of the other things put forth in this book. I do think microaggressions and rape culture are real. I do think impact matters, even if the intent is not bad. I think that the whole impact mattering MORE than intent is crap, but impact does matter. If you break someone’s toe, even if you didn’t mean it, their toe is still broken. You need to take responsibility and be more careful in the future. But screaming at them, “I DON’T CARE IF YOU MEANT IT OR NOT YOU ARE A TERRIBLE PERSON WHO IS JUST AS BAD AS SOMEONE WHO MEANT TO BREAK MY TOE” is not helpful for anyone. Y’all. This all comes down to critical thinking. The left has a point. The protection and coddling comes from the place of understanding that, as horrible and elitist as this sounds, most people don’t think critically. It is why I would hesitate to recommend this book to most people. They will not be able to read it in a nuanced way. But whether or not people think critically, WE HAVE TO LET THEM TRY. And really, that is what this comes down to. We have to let people think and hear and see all sides of something, even if that means they are going to come to conclusions we don’t agree with."

130,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1484853-simone,Rating 3 out of 5,"This was a more temperate and measured book than the name implies, which is interesting because according to some interviews with the authors, they were pushed to use this title for marketing purposes. Mostly, this from a review at Inside Higher Ed: ""For two, despite the title, students are never actually portrayed as “coddled” or “entitled.” Rather, the authors’ primary focus is on enhancing the well-being of “iGen” students who Haidt and Lukianoff recognize are more anxious and depressed with every successive year.If it seems odd that a book primarily concerned with the well-being of students would boast a title implying that those students are “coddled,” I agree, as does Greg Lukianoff, who has told both Jaschik and the Chronicle of Higher Education that he essentially disagrees with his own title – preferring “Disempowered” – but ultimately going with the publisher’s preferred “The Coddling of the American Mind” because it is “less boring.”The title is a discordant note coming from two authors who center the benefits of rational debate as a necessary part of our public discourse. It’s as though we should be truthful and accurate, except when it comes to having an attention-grabbing title which will help sell a lot of books.[1]Lukianoff wanted to call the book “Disempowered” because, as he tells Jaschik, “We [Haidt and Lukianoff] believe we [society at large] have unwittingly taught a generation of students the mental habits of anxious, depressed, polarized people, and we need to rethink how we do everything from parenting in K-12, through, of course, higher education.”Read more here: https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/..."
131,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8967389-isaac,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have a lot of respect for how the authors organized this book; juxtaposing 3 quotes from different wisdom traditions with the 3 bad ideas from their silly story of their trip to the oracle on Mt. Olympus. They clearly lay out their ideas, support them well and circle back with summaries so you get the repetition and an easy reference (very similar to Righteous Mind).Overall they hit a lot of points that I support strongly; intellectual humility, unsupervised play for kids, free speech, correlation does not imply causation and one of the tightest and clearest argument for equality of opportunities not outcomes I have consumed.That said, a fair chunk of the book relied on recent anecdotes of events on college campuses which I felt were written for emotional impact (certainly made my blood boil), but it felt strange to have that emotion stoked in a book that encourages carpe datum and a mistrust of emotions. There is trend data to back up these anecdotes, so they aren't put forward as sole evidence, but it still felt a little weird.It also felt a little weird how much of the the book seems to expose you to an idea, like free range parenting, reducing screen time or gap years, but then simply referred you to to other books and websites for organizations created by people who are promoting their own research. Felt a little lazy on the authors part, and again ran counter to some of the themes of critical thinking and differing opinions.Minor gripes aside this is a good resource and provides some excellent arguments and frameworks for thinking about some issues that are near and dear to me as a parent and an employee in a university."
132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1617691-paul-stout,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is one of the most eye-opening books I've read in a long time. Haidt explains what is happening in the minds of the Internet generation who are raised on three great untruths: 1. Feelings are the best guide to correctness.2. One should avoid pain or discomfort (what doesn't kill you makes you weaker). 3. One should find fault in others, and not in one's self.Because of these three great untruths, safety is more important than anything. We have prepared the road for the child, instead of the child for the road. Helicopter parents do everything they can to spare their children from anything unsafe. For example, peanuts in schools. In the end, a zero-tolerance against peanuts, according to documented studies, has CAUSED children to become allergic. The same is true for anything else unsafe. Fearing abductors and molesters, a whole generation of parents kept their children inside, playing video games. This marked the end of free-range children.Even worse, any idea that upsets the child, is deemed to be dangerous. Therefore youth entering college, starting in 2014, were afraid of any ideas that ran counter to their own thinking. Thus the removal of teachers and guest speakers that offered counterpoints from the opposite political end of the spectrum: both left and right. Anything they don't agree with can be labeled as dangerous speech. We have entered the era of identity politics where it's always ""us vs them."" "
133,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"Constant repetition of the thesis backed up by anecdotal evidence was both hard to listen to and left me relatively unconvinced. There is some truth in their arguments, particularly the more data-driven ""explanatory threads"" section, how the definition of safety has come to include both physical and emotional safety, and how protecting emotional safety has limited free speech and stymied debate on campus. However, I found that I disagreed the most with their flat disdain of microaggressions. Arguing that students should ""stop assuming the worst"" is difficult to hear coming from two white men. Pointing out (but not demonizing) situations where the microaggressor doesn't realize the effect of their speech is crucial so that they are made aware (nicely) and don't perpetuate that behavior.Since this book discussed the group of college students born after 1995 that I am a part of, I may have gotten defensive about their sweeping overgeneralizations of my age group. Though the authors did nuance their argument enough to not just blatantly bash Gen Z for everything, there will certainly be older readers who will read this and come to the classic negative conclusion about ""kids these days"".All in all, perhaps it was a good to read something I disagreed with, but I still give it a middling 2.5 stars."

This was an amazing book, so perhaps I should give it 5 stars. I think I will bring a print copy to my book club. The book outlines what many of us have discussed at parent council meetings: why are we trying to protect our kids from everything?! What is wrong with a camping trip? A ski trip? Yep, someone might get hurt. But so what. This book delves even deeper and it is just fascinating. I can see that I am doing some things right, but many things wrong. When my kid feels excluded from a recess activity, I can see now that I am coddling too much. Sometimes you might feel left out, your feelings might be hurt, but you are not actually hurt, and you are still safe, you just need to decide how to deal with it. I wish I had read it earlier, but since much deals with the teen years, I still have time. And it's not a parenting book, it's a ""what's wrong with our society"" book, as it addresses university education and entering the work force too, and how ""we"" have failed an entire generation or more. I don't mean to sound like a downer, because I actually felt quite good for much of the read! It was compelling at any rate :)"

The victimization, the rise in anxiety and depression, the overprotective parenting, the constant bombardment by public shaming and people being offended over littlest things, the anger, the tribalism, the great divide... you name it, this book ties them all in an intelligent, non-partisan, logical argument that our well-intended desire to create safe environment for all misdirecting us straight into hell of an existence.

As I read, I noted many places where the same critiques the authors make of lefty college kids could be rightly leveled at lots of other groups as well. For example, the examples of irrational fear, the division of the world into good and evil, etc, applies to anyone in a cult, anyone in an echo chamber, conspiracy theorists, even some mainstream religions. Yet the book never uses any of these as examples, but applies the 3 lies framework ONLY to college students. To me, it felt like this book really wanted to critique a certain group of people (“leftist” college students) and so it laid out an admittedly unhealthy set of behaviors that applies to multiple groups of people but then ONLY discussed examples of it at colleges among young people and ignored the fact that older people fall into the same mental traps."

Yet another entry in the increasingly crowded world of ""viral Atlantic articles turned into marginally interesting full-length books."" Haidt and Lukianoff make a relatively limited critique -- the titular ""American mind"" is like 2% of the population -- but I think their basic point is correct, i.e., the principles of CBT can be applied to curing psychological distortions among leftist college students. The real target of this book seems to be affluent parents of Gen Y/Z children, and the argument is framed as a curious sort of self-help manual (checklists and bullet points etc.). Anyway, if you read the Atlantic article you aren't missing much."

141,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116022452-meg,Rating 5 out of 5,"The best non-fiction book I have read in several months (perhaps all year.) This is one of those books I’d give anything for everyone in the world to read. It tackles what feels like every social topic and has some spectacular observations about social trends. This book is for everyone regardless of your race, gender, stage of life, profession, or any other identity marker. There are several things I want to remember about the book, and I freely admit that the numbered/bulleted items are copied and pasted from a website (heterodoxacademy.org) to save myself time, but there are other bits of commentary that are my own. Part I: Three Bad IdeasThe authors observe the following three flaws in thinking that they say are hurting the rising generations:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.3. The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life is a battle between good and evil people.Some criteria that they use to determine what classified as an untruth are:1. It contradicts ancient wisdom – ideas that are found widely in the wisdom literatures of many cultures.2. It contradicts modern psychological research on well-being.3. It harms the individuals and communities who embrace it.In Part 1, the authors also identify several harmful perceptions that can be curbed by practicing CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy:)* Emotional reasoning: Letting your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.”* Catastrophizing: Focusing on the worst possible outcome and seeing it as most likely. “It would be terrible if I failed.”* Overgeneralizing: Perceiving a global pattern of negatives based on a single incident. “This generally happens to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.”* Dichotomous thinking (also known as “black-and-white thinking,” “all-or-nothing thinking,” and “binary thinking”): Viewing events or people in all-or-nothing terms. “I get rejected by everyone,” or “It was a complete waste of time.”* Labeling: Assigning global negative traits to yourself or others (often in the service of dichotomous thinking). “I’m undesirable,” or “He’s a rotten person.”* Mind reading: Assuming that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “He thinks I’m a loser.”* Negative filtering: Focusing almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom noticing the positives. “Look at all the people who don’t like me.”* Discounting positives: Claiming that the positive things you or others do are trivial, so that you can maintain a negative judgment. “That’s what wives are supposed to do – so it doesn’t count when she’s nice to me,” or “The successes were easy, so they don’t matter.”Part 2: Bad Ideas in Action.In this part, the authors give several examples of college universities that have had an outbreak in unfair or unjust “calling out” or “canceling” of administrators, professors, guest speakers, and even peers. The identify the following things about these “political witch-hunts:”1. They happen quickly, appearing in dramatic outbursts. They are not a regular feature of social life.2. The “witch” is perceived to have committed a crime against a valued collective (e.g., The Nation, The People).3. The charges leveled against the “witch” are often trivial or fabricated, and typically involve petty and/or insignificant behavioral acts.4. There is a fear of defending the accused when a public accusation is made. This fear may prevent even close friends and family members from coming to the defense of the accused “witch.”(I would also like to add a point Haidt makes in an interview. People like to do these things for social notoriety, prestige, or “points.” People who want to earn this social credit do not often make their corrections in private with the offender, but they do so publicly so they can be recognized as an activist, no matter how sincere or insincere they might be. Haidt warns that people who engage in this behavior usually become paranoid of being canceled themselves, worrying when their number will come up. “They eat their own.”)Part 3: How Did We Get Here?1. Increasing political polarization since the 1980s.2. Rise in rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide among American adolescents over the past decade.3. Emergence and intensification of safetyism among parents since the 1980s.4. A decline in unsupervised free play (e.g., recess) among children since the 1980s.5. Bureaucratic expansion and corporatization of the education system, particularly at the college level.6. A shift in how social justice is conceptualized, from a focus on equity and proportionality and the promotion of equal opportunity, to a focus on equality of outcome.Part 4: Wising Up* Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child: Acknowledge that children are antifragile and encourage them to engage in unstructured, unsupervised time so they can learn how to judge risks for themselves and practice dealing with frustration and disagreement (see p. 237-240).* Your own worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts unguarded: Teach children the basics of mindfulness and CBT so they can learn to recognize and temper the hallmarks of emotional and motivated reasoning (see p. 241-242).* The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being: Discourage dichotomous thinking and work to develop intellectual humility (see p. 243-244).* Help schools to oppose the Great Untruths: Explore and encourage potential changes to the local education system. At the elementary level suggest minimal homework and more recess with minimal supervision. At the middle school and high school levels work to cultivate individual virtues (e.g., humility), teach debate and offer debate clubs, and assign readings that promote critical thinking and reasoned discussion (see p. 245-249).* Limit and refine device time: Encourage children to spend more time outdoors by placing clear, but reasonable, limits on device time (see p. 249-250).* Support a new national norm of service or work before college: Encourage children to take a “gap year” after high school graduation to further their development in interpersonal realm (see p. 250-251)."

149,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5999538-aaron-west,Rating 3 out of 5,"After having this recommended to me by someone I deeply trust, I thought I'd give it a shot. Imagine my surprise when I see that it was coauthored by none other than The Righteous Mind's Jonathan Haidt. I generally trust Haidt's approach and analyses as honest and well-intentioned, so my initial misgivings of whether this was a Ben Shapiro-esque 'complain-about-the-snowflake-liberals' book (given its title) were abated.With Lukianoff and Haidt's tell-tale graphs, well-researched statistical data, bullet-pointed lists and designations, anecdote-tinged analyses, and a slightly unbalanced scrutiny applied to the liberal/conservative line, the book didn't disappoint. Both writers strike me as good—they want to bring about good in this nation, which seems more divided than ever. In my review of Righteous Mind, I had wondered what Haidt made of the 2016 Election. Now it is clear, and he is trying to bring about common ground where it's more necessary than ever.Both men do a thorough job describing the phenomenon seen growing across the nation—especially on college campuses and online: the swift reaction against and degradation of honest dialogue and academic debate, unhindered by scary ideas and concepts that ~should~ be sorted through rationally by what I've colloquially called ""Woke Culture,"" what Haidt and Lukianoff call ""Call-Out Culture,"" or what is more widely accepted as ""Cancel Culture"" in a way. The fear of judgment and mob-mentality retribution has done damage to honest dialogue in public spheres where genuinely good intentions are concerned. There must be room for grace and redemption in these conversations about how to better society. However, their ideas within this framework aren't without their own fundamental misunderstandings. It's true, as a teacher, I've seen the spread of concept-creep and safetyism, especially among Generation Z, or ""iGen,"" those born in and after 1995. But this rise of safetyism (outside the statistics on rising and falling crime rates) has some authentic origins. For example, while I was teaching the Holocaust, a Jewish student approached me and asked that she be exempt from reading portions of Elie Wiesel's Night. I could have told her no and lamented the inability of this young generation to handle the weight of the world's real issues. But I had the wherewithal and understanding to know that she was well aware of her people's history of persecution—that denying her the ability to read supplemental material was in no way helping her learn from the horrors of the Holocaust. She didn't, as an eighth grader, need to read the two most gruesome scenes in the book to know that gruesome events occurred, which we'd discussed regularly in class.My main qualms with this book are as follows (in true bullet-pointed, Haidt form):- Haidt and Lukianoff seem to grant a moral equivalency between ""sides"" on different issues: almost in a pained, over-compensating way, where it isn't necessary. Things can't always be boiled down so easily.- Following that, the most extreme examples seem to have been cited in the book. While Lukianoff and Haidt admit this, they tend to weight the scales, so to speak, in order to drive home the importance of their message, which doesn't need shock-inducing backing to establish its foundation.- The two lament speech codes (anti-racist and use of proper gender-pronouns) on campuses, seemingly ignoring the true physical (mental) impact that negative speech has on the recipients and their stress levels over time. Some stress cortisol is fine, and inevitable, but it deteriorates mental health when it is sustained.- People who don't experience the same discrimination/bigotry as others tend to write off these people's pain as ""fragility."" The subjective nature of personal trauma is also the subjective nature of the ones who deem that it is NOT, in fact, trauma. What does one do with that? Throwing the word fragility around like confetti doesn't somehow solidify one's stance.- The authors take specific issue with the term Microaggressions, as aggression insinuates intentional, directed harm. I raise the question: Can't microaggressions be subconscious? Aggression can, at times, not be a conscious decision. So why not admit they are an issue founded in actual aggression, at least at times? While they may be unintentional, they still have a real impact.*** - The disinvitation of provocative speakers is passed off by Haidt and Lukianoff as cognitively-lazy, safe, sensitive students, but this assumption is extremely tone-deaf and narrow in my estimation. They never stop to consider that students HAVE heard/read these speakers before, and have thus formed their desire to keep things like hate speech away from a platform. Words have real implications and can cause real harm. The authors bemoan that students see discomfort from what they hear as literal harm, whereas I think they fundamentally misunderstand what students feel. It is no secret that hate speech and ideas CAN be dangerous, or lead to physical harm: as one who teaches the Holocaust, this is central to our exploration of how hateful ideas spread. Look at the rise in hate crimes since Trump took office. To say that Trump is literally responsible isn't necessarily true as stated, but I believe there's a definite correlation between hateful rhetoric, and a permissive attitude to speak things that weren't openly acceptable to be spoken before—for good reason—and the violence that has ensued. Can we truly sum up the avoidance of platforming/showcasing/disseminating dangerous (yes, potentially harmful, violence-inducing) words as whiny millenials/members of Gen Z intent on becoming offended? Again, words carry clout and cause real actions.- The ""Principle of Charity"" —the idea that we should give the benefit of the doubt to those who do or say offensive things—may be good in principle. But intentions aren't always so crystal clear. How much should this be applied? How much in history could marginalized groups have been told to effectively be quiet because they're not ""showing charity""?- Intersectionality: privilege. The authors suggest that some have taken the discussion around privilege to label others' morality. But this does not mean ""evil and good."" Privilege needs to be discussed and termed as simply advantages. Perhaps this has been taken too far by some, but it should not demean the integrity of the conversation, and the very real advantages (privileges) that affect groups differently.Overall, though, the book is important, well-written, and it begins a conversation that is so often shut down by internet trolls, Russian bots, or a mob of self-appointed woke watchdogs. The ""Three Great Untruths"" developed by Lukianoff and Haidt have real implications for the future we are creating: 1) What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Weaker; 2) Always Trust Your Feelings; 3) Life Is a Battle between Good People and Evil People.When we dismantle these untruths, raise a resilient group of critical thinkers, and open honest academic dialogue instead of run in the opposite direction for fear of critical backlash, we will have a more secure, sound, and hopefully just, society."
150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7839801-george-p,Rating 5 out of 5,"“This is a book about wisdom and its opposite,” write Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt in The Coddling of the American Mind. “It is a book about three psychological principles and about what happens to young people when parents and educators—acting with the best of intentions—implement policies that are inconsistent with those principles.” In my opinion, it is also a book every American concerned with the future of our nation’s public discourse and democratic culture should read.And yes, I am serious about that.The Coddling of the American Mind grew out of the increased support among college students for censorship of controversial opinions, a trend that Lukianoff began to notice in the fall of 2013. Lukianoff is president and CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a leading advocate for free speech on college and university campuses. In his experience, until that time, the leading advocates for censorship had been college administrators. What was driving the rapid rise of support for censorship among students?For much of his life, Lukianoff had suffered clinical depression, even contemplating suicide in late 2007. In 2008, he underwent cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a form of psychotherapy that identifies distorted patterns of thinking that often underlie depression and anxiety, and this helped him tremendously. As Lukianoff interacted with students, he noticed that the way they reasoned about controversial issues often mirrored the same cognitive distortions CBT teaches people to control.This insight led to a conversation with Haidt, a social psychologist, Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership at New York University’s Stern School of Business, and author of The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion. That conversation led to a feature storyin the September 2015 issue of The Atlantic. The book builds out the article’s core thesis.Lukianoff and Haidt unfold their argument in three parts: Part I, “Three Bad Ideas,” looks at “three Great Untruths”:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Weaker2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always Trust Your Feelings3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life Is a Battled Between Good People and Evil PeopleTaken together, these untruths result in “a culture of safetyism” on campus, whereby students must be protected from opposing opinions that might “harm” their “safety,” no longer defined as physical safety but now as emotional safety too.The results of this culture of safetyism, ironically enough, are intimidation and violence on the one hand and witch hunts on the other, as the Lukianoff and Haidt argue in Part II, “Bad Ideas in Action.”They cite the February 1, 2017, anti-Milo Yiannopoulos riot at the University of California at Berkeley as an example of the former, though there are many such examples scattered throughout the book. But the threats of violence are not merely coming from leftwing Antifa activists on campus. The authors point to alt-right off-campus provocation as well, specifically the neo-Nazi march through the University of Virginia’s campus on August 11, 2017. The confrontation between protesters and counterprotesters the next day resulted in the vehicular murder of Heather Heyer by an alt-right driver.Lukianoff and Haidt cite several examples of academic witch hunts conducted against professors who utter heterodox ideas, even if they are liberal or leftwing. Prof. Bret Weinstein’s protest of the “Day of Absence” at Evergreen State College in Washington is a leading example of this. The school is quite liberal, as is Weinstein. On its annual Day of Absence, minority faculty students since the 1970s had gone off campus to make their absence, and hence contributions, palpable. But in 2017, organizers of the event asked white faculty and students not to show up. Weinstein thought this went too far and was subjected to vicious protests for saying so.As these events illustrate, college and university campuses, which are supposed to be beacons of free speech, have instead in many cases become their opposite. There is no one-size-fits-all explanation for why this has happened, but in Part III, “How Did We Get Here?,” Lukianoff and Haidt identify “six interacting explanatory threads”:""rising political polarization and cross-part animosity; rising levels of teen anxiety and depression; changes in parenting practices; the decline of free play; the growth of campus bureaucracy; and a rising passion for justice in response to major national events, combined with changing ideas about what justice requires.""This may be the most interesting part of the book, rich in social scientific detail and fair-minded in its analysis. As the parent of three elementary-age children, the chapters on “Paranoid Parenting” and “The Decline of Free Play” were thought-provoking and helpful.Part IV, “Wising Up,” builds on the analysis of the previous chapters and suggests a way forward for making “Wiser Kids,” “Wiser Universities,” and “Wiser Societies,” as the titles of the three chapters indicate. A table on page 263 summarizes the argument of the entire book, so I’ll reproduce it here:PSYCHOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE // WISDOM //GREAT UNTRUTH1. Young people are antifragile. // Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. // What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.2. We are all prone to emotional reasoning and the confirmation bias. // Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded. But once mastered, no one can help you as much, not even your father or your mother. // Always trust your feelings.3. We are all prone to dichotomous thinking and tribalism. // The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. // Life is battle between good people and evil people.As I mentioned at the outset of this review, I am serious when I say that every American concerned with the future of our nation’s public discourse and democratic culture should read The Coddling of the American Mind. It stimulated my thinking as a parent and helped form a better opinion of contemporary events as a concerned citizen.

151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37729607-av,Rating 5 out of 5,"I think after Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast & Slow, this was only my 2nd book that packed such an insurmountable amount of research and insights. It was almost like reading a research paper (though I've never read one) but the findings contained were truly gripping.The book basically revolves around disproving the three great untruths (as per the authors),1. What doesn't kill you makes you weaker2. Always trust your feelings3. Life is a battle between Good people and Evil peopleAnd the authors take into account two main areas - upbringing of kids and the hostile climate at university campuses & how that lead to student actions, to illustrate how harmful these untruths can be.Also, you'll find 6 core pointers, that the authors keep coming back to, as reasons behind all that's wrong with the the upbringing of children, specifically iGens (born in 1995 & further) and the hostility on college campuses.1. Rising political polarization2. Rising rates of adolescent depression & anxiety3. Shift to a more fearful, protective & intensive parenting in middle class & wealthy families4. Widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation for members of iGen5. An expanding campus bureaucracy taking an increasingly overprotective posture6. A rising passion for justice and combined with a growing commitment to attaining ""equal outcomes"" in all areas. (I too was surprised to know that you cannot bring the equality debate to just about everything)There are tons of examples to showcase in what manners the culture of safetyism is affecting the kids today and how, once ingrained, they take this mindset to colleges which later transforms to ""how my views always need to be protected"", ""how I should not come across or listen to people with differing views"", ""how anything that I don't believe in is not just wrong but can harm me too"" and ""how I need to always feel safe in everything"".I came across Jonathan Haidt and this book on The Farnam Street Podcast (you NEED to check it out if you haven't already). So if you want to evaluate whether you resonate with the author's views, you can check the podcast out here - https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/jon...And if you wish to get a gist of all the things the book is about, here's the long article on The Atlantic by the authors which was the starting point of the book - https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/..."
152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13142351-douglas,Rating 2 out of 5,"It didn’t take long for me to be disappointed with the promise of this title. Perhaps the provocation was intentional. This is a book, not a peer reviewed academic research article. They play fast and loose with important words and concepts, such as conveniently interchanging truth, wisdom and knowledge to support whatever normative conclusion they wanted. I dogeared so many pages the book is noticeably thicker in the top corner and I made so many margin notes that I ran out of ink. This was not a treatise in defense of free speech, but an apologetic for right wing (libertarian?) provocations of university students and the more general malaise of anti-political correctness, whatever term we have for that. As one of those older white males who don’t vote Republicans because I was a college activist that lived through 1968, I wonder if the authors would have said the same about our day. We took any opportunity to be heard- or make a scene- to influence policy directions especially for civil rights and imperialistic aggression. Too many times they used “of course”, “obviously” and other waffle terms to imply credibility. I got tired of them taking people to task for “safetyism” and then taking (accepting) a stand against threats, violence, hate speech, etc. I have long felt that the measure of a culture or society is how they treat their most vulnerable populations. Fortunately we have made progress but that may mean we have to accept responsibility for all of our vulnerable populations. Enough, I can’t write another book. But one last note- notice how early and quietly they note that this is problem of the privileged by specifically focusing on the middle class (and above). “…. O, the humanity…” as if we need to save the privileged classes from the curse of political correctness. Oh yeah- and they saved ""good people on both sides"" until their final pages. ‘…nuff said…’"

In book form there was much repetition and at times his point became lost amidst all of his examples.A few things that particularly stood out to me:-The statement about females’ aggression coming out through words which is inescapable on social media. I have experienced this personally and am shocked at how purposeful this aggression continues to be in females of older ages. -“The decline in free play was likely driven by a rising emphasis on testing, test preparation, and homework; and a corresponding deemphasis on physical and social skills.” As an elementary teacher this has never been more clear since our return to in-person learning from Covid. Parents want their students to opt-out of Social Emotional Learning activities and increase their tutoring time - more importance is placed on the academics they “missed” while being out of the classroom than the social interactions. -The consumerism theory of universities. It is mind blowing how college has become a place where parents and students demands are met rather than educating and preparing for the future. We see this at the elementary level as well and it’s frustrating to see the emotions of parents placed higher than data on their own student, research based solutions, and the attempt of giving students more independence and responsibility. I would recommend reading the essay for interesting points of view and data from the past years but reading the entirety of the book is not necessary. 🤷🏽‍♀️"

155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9572312-brian-want,Rating 4 out of 5,"(4.25 stars.) An important and useful book. Haidt and Lukianoff, writing in 2018, pull together both anecdotes and research to examine some interrelated topics that have niggled me for the last decade: the fragility and strangeness of Gen Z, cognitive distortions in our politics (including all-or-nothing thinking and catastrophizing), entrenched victim mindsets, excesses of wokeness, negative effects of social media, overprotection of kids, threats to free expression, and much more.Since publication, we have lived through the tumult of 2020-2021, and all of this seems even more resonant and alarming. I like the structure of the book, which keeps reconnecting to what the authors call three great ""untruths"": what doesn't kill you makes you weaker (fragility), always trust your feelings (emotional reasoning), and life is a battle between good people and evil people (us-them binaries). These kinds of distortions are wound around their six ""explanatory threads,"" all of which seem plausible, are supported by available research to date, and make intuitive sense to me as a Gen Xer (technically a Gen Xer on the Millennial cusp). If you're a fan of John McWhorter's cultural commentary, the Twitter accounts of Josh Barro or Cathy young, or the podcasts of folks like Coleman Hughes or Meghan Daum, you will probably dig this book and find yourself nodding along vigorously. Of course, the people who most need to read this book are probably the ones least likely to pick it up."

There was a long wait list and I ended up having too many other things on my plate by the time it came back around—so this time I just bought a copy of it. I’ve heard it talked about a lot, so I feel like I had the Cliff Notes edition to begin with, on top of rereading the first portion of the book. Parts of the book felt a little drawn out to me, as if they were trying to extend their argument further than necessary (I was already convinced), but the numerous examples were well -researched to support their arguments. They push CBT specifically a little too much, but I think the principles are helpful to consider applying, and especially for Christians to apply alongside the truth of the gospel. As someone who works with college students, I think this book is really insightful, and the authors are spot on with many of their observations. It’s helpful in understanding this current generation of students, and it pushes me to think about what is true even for me as a Millennial—and how I want to parent my own children to be more resilient and more aware of their own thoughts and the world around them.

But I just couldn't bring myself to give it a perfect score. Looking at today's culture, I can't help but ask, ""what happened?!"" A lot of the culture shift that they explore in this book they claim happened around 2013, which was the tail end of my college experience. Looking back, I do feel as though it was evident that something was changing, and it seemed to be happening rapidly. I know that there is nothing new under the sun... but it seemed to happen so quickly. This book was helpful to see how it is that we have ended up in a world obsessed with feeling ""safe."" The authors traced back generations to see where it all began and showed how it wasn't just something that appeared out of thin air. I view myself as more middle of the road politically, and I felt as though the authors really tried to not blame one party over the other, which was good. Overall, it was a helpful book! I think the thing that kept me from giving it a perfect score was the fact that they kept making plugs for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). There's nothing wrong with CBT, but I felt like the plugs were awkward and irrelevant to the discussion at times."

In fact, it was so important to Haidt and Lukianoff (who are both left-leaning but are opposed to certain trends) that this book be bipartisan, they had multiple beta readers of various political views give their feedback prior to publication. This book, an expansion of an Atlantic article, asserts that modern higher education and society as a whole are doing young people a disservice by teaching them several ""Great Untruths."" These untruths breed conflict and tribalism, limit learning and exchange of ideas, and ultimately make people unhappier. Here are the Untruths followed by their counterparts, the principles that the authors believe we should follow instead:UNTRUTH: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.PRINCIPLE: Young people are antifragile (they grow stronger from experiencing adversity).Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.UNTRUTH: Always trust your feelings.PRINCIPLE: We are all prone to emotional reasoning and the confirmation bias.Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded. But once mastered, no one can help you as much.UNTRUTH: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.PRINCIPLE: We are all prone to dichotomous thinking and tribalism.The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.I'd happily recommend this book to anyone (or at least I'd recommend the article, for a shorter summary), especially anyone involved in the world of education."
159,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I rather enjoyed this book. Shout out to Chris Pratt for listening to me talk so much about the book, it really helped me condense the books main message down to a few coherent statements. Here they are:1. Our society is beginning to accept three “great untruths.” First, what doesn’t kill me makes me weaker. In other words, people are fragile and need to be protected because uncomfortable situations will cause us serious harm. Second, always trust your emotions. If you feel something is true, bad, good, or harmful then you don’t have, and indeed should not, analyze it closely. Third, the world is divided into good people and evil people. Good people have an obligation to fight the bad guys. 2. The opposite of the untruths are that uncomfortable situations, ideas, and conversations are essential for us to grow and become stronger, wiser, and better humans. Rather than encouraging “safteyism” by shielding people from ever encountering potentially offensive or uncomforting experiences, we should encourage them to embrace those experiences. By doing that, we will be in a position to critically examine the legitimacy and accuracy of differing beliefs and rationale. It was also help us recognize the common humanity of “the other side” and provide a bulwark against tribalism (us vs. them thinking).3. I need to watch out for institutions, policies, politics, and thoughts that embrace these three untruths. I should in my own life to replace them with healthier schemas.4. Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) can help people reject these untruths and live happier and healthier lives. (On a side note, I learned about CBT in a mental health class I took recently and felt it was a powerful tool)."
160,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Great analysis of current trends we see happening on university campuses and society in general, such as the increasingly polarized political landscape, the culture of safety-ism, the increase in adolescent depression, the intolerance to thought diversity, and the emotional fragility of younger generations. Haidt and Lukianoff make a strong and coherent argument for the need to reassess how we raise and educate our children and how we should all foster anti-fragility. The authors make a great effort of outlining how the left and the right are both acting forces in these trends. The book’s only caveat is that the potential remedies presented seemed weak, overly optimistic, and thus, unconvincing. That being said, I believe every student, past-student, parent, teacher, and university admin should read this book!"

This book in particular challenged me since many of the examples challenged extreme examples of people who have liberal leaning views and at some points I felt very unsure if I wanted to finish. I though this book had some good quotes including: “Pave the child for the road, not the road for the child”“Argue like you are right, listen like you are wrong”I do think how they covered the topic of micro aggressions came off like it is a “buzz word” and never gave a definition or explanation of it. I think it was handled very poorly and gave the impression that if people accused you of it, they were being sensitive. This book was also written in 2018 so a lot of what it covers talks about the extremists from 2016 around the election which I think it important to know before you dive in."

In other words - they detail the consequences of when this behavior is institutionalized/systemic.Its dangerous.I found the authors to be pragmatic and fair. They offer insight and perspective that does not hold back from its passion and force of argument. But much like the environment they are trying to remind us of - they also acknowledge their bias and blindspots. In other words - they represent exactly the kind of environment that is being lost in the world today. I found it refreshing to remind myself what this kind of space can look like."

CBT was becoming a necessity at Napa State Hospital prior to my leaving it in 2012. The information was useful for patients with Personality Disorders, and staff for better interactions as well as lowered aggressions. This would be a fantastic book to read if you are ever around children: parents, teachers, mentors, god-parents, grandparents, aunts/uncles, you get the picture.I appreciate how they address the issues facing us today not just from one side of the aisle but from every angle and point out places for each side to change and improve on. I also second their opinion about giving the option to have a gap-year to work with other population or areas of the country world then your own to get a grasp on how other people think/act/live prior to going into school with only one narrow viewpoint and how colleges need to encourage this. Overall just a well thought out and helpful book. And I appreciate the website with sources available. Warning: Strong language when quoting."

Discusses the idea of ""antifragility"" - about how ""safe spaces,"" ""microaggressions,"" and how ""concept creep"" of some words like ""violence"" and ""harm"", combined with overparenting practices have made people unable to bear the consideration of ideas which contradict their own and, therefore, unable to hold an intelligent debate or come up with bipartisan solutions. This book also offers solutions for these problems, discussing campus policies protecting free speech, and a form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to expose young people to these ideas that they find ""harmful"" until they can prove to themselves that an idea does not hurt, a speech is not violent (unless it was specifically intended to incite violence), and that exposure to these things are necessary for proper education.

165,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4534242-public-scott,Rating 5 out of 5,"Probably the best nonfiction book I've read all year. The authors painstakingly dissect how people with the best intentions are killing freedom of speech in the US. The three great untruths, as they call them, form the basis for their argument. They are as follows:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.3. The Untruth of Us vs. Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. It is these untruths that make Twitter or any social media such hostile territory for some. These untruths have given us ""safe spaces"" and angry confrontations about who can and cannot speak at colleges. With a background in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, the authors challenge these untruths and show, quite convincingly, that parents and educators are getting some very basic things wrong these days. I found the arguments in this book compelling and powerful. The format of the book is logical and the reasoning sound. I loved this book."

More importantly, it provides ways to reverse current trends and how to prevent them in the future. Parents, including me, will benefit from reading this book for methods to properly challenge and strengthen our children, their thinking, and their processing of events that occur around and to them. My one big critique is the failure to acknowledge or identify the spiritual causative factors at play. Some of this is simply to the word choice used to describe similar concepts, but there are important ones missing such as the effect of sin, the reality that people are made in the image of God, and that people are inherently responsible for their actions and emotions.

168,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145310142-megan-cordone,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’ll frame this review by first saying I’m a huge fan of Jonathan Haidt and I tend to agree with most things he writes in the Atlantic. This is the first book of his I’ve read and I absolutely loved it. I like how he structures the book using the three untruths (The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people). Rather than just blame the adoption of these untruths on universities or one political party, he lays out an extremely elaborate web that illustrates that the increasing fragility of Gen Z and younger millennials is everyone’s fault. To name a few of his main issue areas: parenting, college admissions, social media, “words as violence”, and others. Also framing the impact of the untruths using CBT, or cognitive behavioral therapy outlined how coddling worsens mental health. I find this book especially compelling because the authors make it clear that they care about social justice and they want the best for the younger generations. (This isn’t just a chance for older generations to bash millennials/Gen Z). They clearly outline why call out culture and safetyism do far less for groups that most young people care about helping. The concepts in this book can do so much to lessen political polarization and I hope more people heed the message.Some quotes I liked:“Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think.”“There’s an old saying: “Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.”“Redaction is the new rebuttal.”“The modern obsession with protecting young people from “feeling unsafe” is, we believe, one of the (several) causes of the rapid rise in rates of adolescent depression, anxiety, and suicide”"

However, this book did well in articulating those ideas and was also helpful in providing data and additional context.As a father, I was particularly struck by the effects the “culture of safety” has had on the raising of children. In so many cases, children’s safety is prioritized so highly that children are no longer able to have unsupervised time to learn and develop. Neither are they allowed to experiment and play with anything that could pose a risk to them. The result can be young people that are risk averse, and unable to cope with challenges that life throws their way.In reading this book, I’ve been challenged in how I parent my children as well as how I interact with people and ideas that differ from my own."

175,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/502680-david,Rating 4 out of 5,"If you are a parent or work with college students, this book is an absolute must-read! I'd say that this one, along with Jean Twenge's book iGen, are two vital books for people my age and older to understand those under 25.*Lukianoff and Haidt ask why university campuses seemed to explode with protest about free speech and safety around the year 2013. Why are more and more invited speakers being met with resistance to the point of being disinvited? Why does it seem that protests erupt over a few words in relatively innocuous emails or speeches by people who, it would seem, are solid members of the same group doing the protesting? Speaking of protesting, this is not a book that blames ""those silly liberals"" or anything like that. Haidt and Lukianoff point out the right also has its own form of identity politics and does its own protests in the desire to shut people down. Some of this should make the reader want to go back and read Haidt's The Righteous Mind. The point is, while it is easy or tempting to see these campus problems as a problem for the left and thus to expect this book to attack safe spaces and intersectionality, the reality is this book is not that The authors demonstrate good scholarship by affirming what is good and seeking to target the extremes.In the introduction they mention three great untruths that have spread in recent years:1. The Untruth of Fragility - What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning - Always Trust your feelings3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them - Life is a battle between good people and evil people.Each of these goes against centuries of received wisdom and creates the sorts of people who always think they are unsafe, hear everything as a personal attack, and neatly group any who differ with them at all as bad. It is healthier to recognize that we become stronger through challenges, often our feelings lead us astray and that the line between good and evil cuts through each of us.The authors then go through six factors that have caused these untruths to proliferate. Young people did not just all of a sudden decide to believe these, they were taught them. Here again the authors are balanced. Despite our parents saying, ""Bah...we didn't wear seatbelts in the 70s, we played outside all day with no supervision...we were fine,"" the statistics are they were not fine. Safety measures have led to a drastic decrease in childhood deaths. This is a good thing. The problem is when we become so unbalanced that we seek to remove anything - physical or emotional - that causes even an iota of unsafety. Seat belts are good! Not allowing kids to fail because it hurts their feelings is bad!While I was reading this book I was chatting with some family members. My mom and her sister both declared that parents (my generation) today are too soft. We coddle our kids! We are not their friends! I asked my mom if she was a parent today, would she let her kid walk to the park alone? She was aghast! Of course not, it is unsafe, she said! I chuckled and pointed out she would be coddling her kids today too. Then she talked about the story of the kid abducted and killed in the early 80s. This child's father went on to host America's Most Wanted. It was a huge story and apparently shaped how my mom parented and her fear of child abductions.Literally the next day as I was reading this book, they mentioned that story! They pointed out this impacted millions of moms like mine, even though, statistically, kids are much more likely to be abducted by a family member than a stranger. The whole thing was just an interesting real life reflection on this book: the older generation accusing new parents of being soft not realizing their own softness shaped this generation; the realization that things are more safe now and when we seek safety we often fear the wrong thing. The truth is, all parents want what is best for their kids and often think the next generation of parents are messing up.So what do we do?After going through all of this, Lukianof and Haidt end with some ideas for how to fix things and move forward. They are hopeful and we should be too. We can resist this insane need for our kids to get into an Ivy League school. We can teach them it is okay to fail and that losing teaches good lessons. Of course, the challenge is that we do not always notice the cultural forces at work. My mom didn't realize it was highly unlikely I'd ever be abducted. She just knew it had happened and was all over the news. When the whole culture is swimming one way, its hard to swim the other.That's why this is such a helpful book for parents. I plan to put together some discussions on it for the college students and campus pastors I work with. There's a lot here to think about and keep thinking about.*I will be 40 in January 2020 making me one of the oldest Millennials. Millennials were born between, roughly, 1980-1994. Those born from 1995-2010 are iGen or Generation Z. It is this shift that forms a large background of this book and Twenge explains in detail. Just remember, Millennials are not just all people younger than you, as it still seems according to some publications! "

The Atlantic's most recent work highlights the effect of QAnon's conspiracy theories to sow disinformation and encourage people to paranoia of anything also coming from ""them."" The call-out culture in America is on full display as activists, political candidates, news outlets, and even police and National Guard forces are documented on social media of calling on people to choose sides now. Watching from where I work abroad, it appears the media is escalating the outrage as each additional clip tries to top the previous. The authors first presented their ideas in a 2015 article published by The Atlantic, that was cited by then-President Obama who personally encouraged college students not to be afraid of ideas they disagreed with or possibly found harmful. This book sprang out of a need to further develop the authors' ideas and research. I reach back to Conor Friedersdorf's summary of their thesis as also published in The Atlantic: ""(Lukianoff and Haidt) argue that well-intentioned adults are unwittingly harming young people by raising them in ways that implicitly convey three untruths:The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.The Untruth of Us vs. Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.""...“Whatever your identity, background, or political ideology,” the authors advise young people, “you will be happier, healthier, stronger, and more likely to succeed in pursuing your own goals” if you do three things:Seek out challenges “rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that ‘feels unsafe.’”Free yourself from cognitive distortions “rather than always trusting your initial feelings.”Take a generous view of other people, and look for nuance, “rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality.”I would add to the above summary that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is presented by Lukianoff, in particular, as the potential solution to various anxiety-fear-anger issues in our culture. Teaching people to be more resilient through mindfulness, not overgeneralizing every mistake or criticism, and finding ways to cope are much better than a culture of ""safety-ism"" that create vulnerable populations. Just as vaccines and exposure to harmful substances (ex: peanuts) in small doses build immunity, exposure to different ideas and challenges make us more resilient and more cooperative with one another. ""Trigger warnings are counter-therapeutic"" and college campuses that insist on insulary thinking and over-protection are doing the opposite of what CBT prescribes. In an apparent attempt to please everyone, the authors are very careful about giving caveats in regards to data and such. They issue their own hypothesis on why this cultural phenomenon emerged in 2013-2017. Why is iGen more fragile than previous generations? Are females more vulnerable? Where is this going? There are six trends they examine: 1) An increase in polarization, including an escalation of threats on both sides. 2) A rise in rates of anxiety and depression. 3) The need for ""free-range kids."" 4) The effects of the decline of ""free play"" in childhood. 5) The corporatization of universities as the goal has shifted away from purely education and more on providing what the consumer demands. 6) The increased focus on social justice, distributive justice, Title IX, etc. Some simple proposed solutions by the authors: Let your kids gradually take on more risks and responsibilities as they grow. Beware the ""us vs them"" and call-out culture. Use principles of charity and humility and engage with organizations that foster these. Help schools oppose untruths. Statistically, kids are much safer than they were 20-50 years ago, so the fear and paranoia of not letting your kid ride his bike in the neighborhood is unfounded and harmful. Limit screens and devices and be aware of how they affect your child. Engage with your kids about online activities and culture. Should it really matter to your child if someone unfollows him/her on Instagram? Universities should not allow the heckler's veto. The stories that the authors present from various campuses on how a small group of active protestors could effectively take the campus hostage (in some cases quite literally) are very disturbing. (Aside: If you've read Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse's book The Vanishing American Adult you will find similar ideas and concerns about how to raise kids.)I give the book 4.5 stars out of 5. The fact that this book also divides people makes the authors' point well. "

180,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6410286-brittany,Rating 2 out of 5,"I was pretty disappointed with this book, especially given I had previously rated The Righteous Mind five stars (a relatively rare rating for me). The book was quite interesting when it talked about things other than politics, but when it did, it read like a list of fallacies. Consider that the book opens with the proverb ""prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child"". The charitable interpretation of this statement is that there are some things that can't/are extremely difficult to change and so you must prepare children to deal with them in a responsible manner, even if one doesn't condone how things are currently done. The uncharitable interpretation of this statement is seeing it as a call to reinforce the status quo. That is, don't change the road. It is fine how it is, even if it is a sexist, racist road which would probably be better to be demolished and rebuilt. Instead, change the child to fit the road, and learn to deal with its sexist and racist ways and don't expect there to be any construction to fix the worsening potholes. Now imagine the entire section on politics talks about the ""SJW left"" in the most uncharitable way possible - your response to the uncharitable interpretation I provided regarding the child and the road likely mimics my own response to those sections of the book. As in, no, there are other interpretations possible, some of which are much more likely and much more nuanced than presented.The book uses singular examples of their suggestions working to demonstrate why they are generally true. Yet, the book cautions against using singular examples of the opposite to demonstrate the flaws in their suggestions (if you do, you're ""negatively generalizing"". When they do, it's...different, surely). They talk about appealing to the humanity of others to achieve social justice and provided an example of an Episcopal priest and his wife changing their views on gay marriage once their son came out as gay. The flaw in this argument seems quite obvious to me - that is, the appeal to the humanity of others was lost on these two people until they were intimately affected. It's a necessary, but insufficient step.The authors are quite concerned with the idea that intent matters, to the near exclusion of impact. So, you know, if your boss or professor sexually harasses you, but didn't intend on doing so, well, it's not that bad. They provide an example of intending to murder someone vs. accidentally committing manslaughter and spend minimal time exploring the differences between the two. They fail to realize that the impact is the same, and the harm and distress is still experienced regardless of intent, and yet this doesn't matter to them.They state, ""But students in politically homogeneous departments will mostly be exposed to books and research studies drawn from the left half of the range, so they are likely to come down to the 'left' of the truth, on average...Sometimes the left-leaning view turns out to be correct, sometimes it's the right-leaning view, but on average, students will get closer to the truth if they are exposed to debates among credentialed scholars who approach difficult problems from differing perspectives."" This is some /r/enlightenedcentrism bullshit mixed in with an argument to moderation and it is presented without evidence. This position assumes that the left is right ~50% of the time and the right the other ~50%, for which there is no reason to believe that this is actually the case. Something something reality has a liberal bias something something. The authors talk about the issues associated with subjective standards, such as when they discuss speech codes and how they ""use an overboard and entirely subjective standard for determining wrongdoing"" and then a page later, talk about how ""of course, there should be easy way to report cases of true harassment and employment discrimination"", as if their own subjective standard of ""true harassment and employment discrimination"" is somehow objective and shared by others, and not the entire issue under discussion. Even more amusing when they later quote Alexsander Solzhenitsyn: ""If only it were so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them.""""Until [the moment of realizing you are wrong], the feeling of being wrong is indistinguishable from the feeling of being right. We are all wrong about many things at every moment, but until we know it, we are often quite certain that we are right.""""Mass movements can rise and spread without belief in a god, but never without belief in a devil."" - Eric Hoffer ""The only point of having more is having more than everybody else.Nobody needed 20,000 atomic warheads until the other side had 19,000. Nobody needs eleven extracurriculars, either - what purpose does having them actually sever? - unless the other guy has ten."" -William Deresiewicz""Justice is the first virtue of social institituions, as truth is of systems of thought."" - John RawlsDignity culture vs. honor culture"

186,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/158774988-ian-mcmanus,Rating 3 out of 5,"A compelling premise, supported with sufficient evidence and research, though The Coddling falls short of its priors and peers.The book is a scathing critique of the modern academic and intellectual environment, though purely from a psycho-analytical perspective. For that, Allan Bloom would be disappointed... failing to synthesize the humanities into a synergistic whole, treating the individual domains of the modern 'multiversity' as complete, each claiming a comprehensive perspective on being. I also find the authors' lazy imitation of him, substituting 'Coddling' for 'Closing,' as hard to overcome and generally indicative of its contents.Reading at time was laborious; often the purpose, subject, and intended audience are confused. Though the authors deny Freudian theory, they accept its influence by looking first to early childhood to explain our present disposition. And while they contend the university should principally be a place of learning (""put the search for truth first and the quest for social justice second""), they fail to satisfy that guidance themselves. You get the sense (specifically, through chapters that outline clear guidance targeted to specific personas) that an aim with this book was to create tangible change... as if the pursuit of truth alone would have been less than.


 Argument


The crux of the argument is that harmful ""untruths"" have taken hold across society generally, most acutely in our collegiate academic institutions. These are the untruths of: Fragility (""What doesn't kill you makes you weaker""), Emotional Reasoning (""Always trust your feelings""), and Us Versus Them (""Life is a battle between good people and evil people""). Although it is made manifest during the formative collegiate years, the authors will argue that these ideas ""have their roots in earlier education and childhood experiences.""
The book and argument is principally taken from a psychological point-of-view. As highlighted in the extended quote below, the authors focus on the emotive thought processes rather than the subjects' intellectual and rational; thus, reducing individuals to consumers of 'errant' patterns of thinking that lead to negative outcomes. (This in direct contrast to a more synthesized, 'humanities-based' approach which valuates the human as complex and allows for nuanced causal factors. I find the precedent set by Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind—written 30 years prior—to be more complete.)
 The list below shows nine of the most common cognitive distortions that people learn to recognize in CBT. It is these distorted thought patterns that Greg began to notice on campus, which led him to invite Jon out to lunch, which led us to write our Atlantic article and, eventually, this book.  Emotional Reasoning:  Letting your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. ""I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.""  Catastrophizing:  Focusing on the worst possible outcome and seeing it as the most likely. ""It would be terrible if I failed.""  Overgeneralizing:  Perceiving a global pattern of negatives on the basis of a single incident. ""This generally happens to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.""  Dichotomous Thinking:  Viewing events or people in all-or-nothing terms. ""I get rejected by everyone,"" or ""It was a complete waste of time.""  Mind Reading:  Assuming that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. ""He thinks I'm a loser.""  Labeling:  Assigning global negative traits to yourself or others (often in the service of dichotomous thinking). ""I'm undesirable,"" or ""He's a rotten person.""  Negative Filtering:  You focus almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. ""Look at all of the people who don't like me.""  Discounting Positives:  Claiming that the positive things you or others do are trivial, so that you can maintain a negative judgement. ""That's what wives are supposed to do—so it doesn't count when she's nice to me,"" or ""Those successes were easy, so they don't matter.""  Blaming:  Focusing on the other person as the source of your negative feelings; you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself. ""She's to blame for the way I feel now,"" or ""My parents caused all my problems.""   [pg. 37-38]
Having introduced the fundamental cognitive distortions from CBT theory, the authors can easily identify, bundle, and then classify sets of behaviors common to modern university campuses. By classifying a certain behavior, the inherent psychological (not logical) fallacy is asserted.
Micro-aggressions fall victim to ""Mind Reading."" Marxist-inspired forms of 'common-enemy' identity politics (and its modern manifestations: deconstructionism, poststructuralism, postmodernism, and critical theory) can be ascribed to multiple, but most prominently ""Labeling"" and ""Dichotomous Thinking"" (Us vs Them).
The remainder of the book shifts focus to consider how other factors (upbringing, social media, etc.) have contributed to the tolerant campus environment for these psychological fallacies. Colleges as increasingly consumer-oriented; safety as a higher-order objective; screen time and social media as elevating rates of anxiety and depression in teens... these are confluent factors that enable academic settings that are harmful in the long term. The authors present well-argued and compellingly-presented research compiled from a number of different sources here.
Thus, the arc of the argument can be summarized as: (1) Harmful Untruths have permeated society, with its most prominent source being the university campus. (2) The modern manifestations of these Untruths are actually reflective of cognitive distortions diagnosed in psychotherapy; thus, this line of thinking (and its conclusions) should be disregarded due to its errant emotional biases. (3) The basis for these cognitive distortions in individual and collective thinking starts in early childhood, primarily the result of over-emphasizing security and safety in all aspects in parenting. This is further enabled by a series of broad social, economic, and technical evolutions. (4) This trend can be stopped and eventually reversed if we address the aforementioned root cause(s).


 Key Concepts

The 3 'Great Untruths,' which each contradict ancient wisdom, contradict modern psychological research on well-being, and harm the individuals or communities who embrace it: (1) Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. (2) Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. (3) Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.Internal versus external locus of control. Transgenderism and transracialism as comparable identity transformations with drastically different levels of societal acceptance. Increasing levels of depression as amplifying certain perceptions and behaviors, through ""learned helplessness"" and ""hostile attribution bias."" ""Concerted cultivation"" versus ""natural growth parenting."" The decline of unsupervised free play as causal for an inability to regulate conflict; leads to a tendency to invoke force and/or third parties whenever conflict arises. 'Forbidden base rates' as an enforcement tool for unacceptable correlations in statistical analysis.Distributive justice (the perception that people are getting what is deserved) and procedural justice (the perception that the process by which things are distributed and rules enforced is fair and trustworthy). Proportionality at the heart of equity theory, core to distributive justice - that when the ratio of outcomes to inputs is equal for all participants, people perceive that to be equitable or fair. This form of equity theory (and proportional-procedural social justice) as at odds with equal-outcomes social justice, which enforces equal outcomes rather than equal access.

 Notable Quotes

  More generally, the microaggression concept reveals a crucial moral change on campus: the shift from ""intent"" to ""impact."" In moral judgement as it has long been studied by psychologists, intent is essential for assessing guilt. We generally hold people morally responsible for acts they intended to commit. [Sic] However, some activists say that bigotry is only about impact (as they define impact); intent is not even necessary.  [pg. 43-44] —  The argument that words can be violence was made by Lisa Feldman Barrett, a well-respected professor of psychology and emotion researcher at Northeastern University. Barrett offered this syllogism: ""If words can cause stress, and if prolonged stress can cause physical harm, then it seems that speech—at least certain types of speech—can be a form of violence. We responded [sic] noting that it is a logical error to accept the claim that harm—even physical harm—is the same as violence.""  [pg. 95] — 

 The vulnerability [Americans as exploitable] comes with an unfortunate asymmetry: the faculty and students at universities have shifted to the left since the 1990s, as we showed in the last chapter, while the ""outrage industry"" of talk radio, cable news networks, and conspiracy websites is more developed and effective on the right.

—
  They defined victimhood culture as having three distinct attributes: First, ""individuals and groups display high sensitivity to slight""; second, they ""have a tendency to handle conflicts through complaints to third parties""; and third, they ""seek to cultivate an image of being victims who deserve assistance.""  Of special relevance to our concerns in this chapter is the second attribute. Campbell and Manning pointed out that the presence of administrators or legal authorities who can be persuaded to take one's side an intervene is a prerequisite for the emergence of victimhood culture. They noted that when administrative remedies are easily available and there is no shame in calling on them, it can lead to a condition known as ""moral dependence."" People come to rely on external authorities to resolve their problems, and, over time, ""their willingness or ability to use other forms of conflict management atrophy.""  [pg. 210] "
187,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"3/4 even 4/5 of this book was absolute genius. The three untruths were fantastic and made me look at things completely different. Still, this book left me unsatisfied every time I ended a reading session.It started with little things. They mention universal truths without ever mentioning the Bible. I figure, maybe they just don't want to alienate some of their audience. The three universal untruths are all easily conquered through Biblical truths, but it's never mentioned. Avoiding an obvious reference because it offends you is the first untruth (what doesn't kill us makes us weaker)The ideas got crazier. They mention how to make a lasting change (pre-2013) people still had to act civilly because they would have to get a vote to get their representatives in to make any kind of lasting change. Then they applaud the Supreme Court giving homosexuals the right to marry. This wasn't done through a vote. In fact, the Supreme Court ILLEGALLY overturned multiple states' voter approvals of Gay Marriage Bans. The justices should have all been impeached for that very act. Instead, the president lights up the Whitehouse like a damn fool, celebrating the fact that more people lost rights than gained them that day. To think the courts were heroes is to be reasoning emotionally; the second untruth.Then the thoughts started straying further. An entire chapter becomes dedicated to how the Left shouldn't be held responsible because the Right provokes them. Except, their examples don't make any sense. A university dean claims a deluge of emails caused him to discipline a professor, how horrible that the right would send threats of violence! Except . . . there wasn't a deluge. The authors admit that the emails were all fabricated and this was another example of the Left still attacking the Left . . . The guy from New Jersey going to ""start executing people?"" Well, that was just a hoax, but other people were arrested. To put the blame on someone else is to create an Us V. Them mindset: the final untruth.Then the ideas started to become completely wrong. The first time they mentioned America as a Democracy I thought I just wasn't understanding them. Surely two educated professors would know that the USA is a republic. In fact, the founding fathers hated democracy and made sure we would never become one. Then they have a complete chapter about the Democracy of America. These guys clearly have no idea what they are talking about.It came to me as to why the book just made me mad after I read it. Without the grounding work of Christ and God, they have no ability to argue morality, sanity, or truth. Their own book is peppered with the very type of thinking they are trying to get people to avoid because they have no lasting reason to argue differently.The authors are democrats because they want to end sexual harassment (as opposed to the Republicans who want to see their wives and daughters attacked). The videos of police shooting black men are everywhere on the internet (despite the fact that statistics from everywhere show that white people get shot just as much as black people). The two finally lose all respect when they define being a democrat with these two lines. This isn't rational. This isn't trying to come to the table with an open-mind and fix anything. This is simply creating an Us V. Them mindset and excusing your side of emotional reasoning and avoiding conflict because you think you are right. The entire framework of the book dissolves and there is no more reason to listen or believe any of this.We're not arguing for equality anymore. The only examples of inequality these guys can dredge up are from the 1960's. Pre-1968 even. They spend more time talking about the 1950's race problems then they spend talking about problems today. These problems only exist in the minds of the people using the Three Untruths to find the problems. Statistically speaking gender and racial inequality don't exist. It's not about inequality anymore. It's about government meddling in areas better left to the private sector. The chapter these two guys admit they are democrats then includes a list of everything DEMOCRATIC Presidents did to screw up rights protecting minorities. It includes reasons why overreaching government and bureaucracy messed everything up by getting involved and getting in the way.This isn't about equality. This is about power. The government uses the media to create a State of Fear among the people, divide the people over petty, stupid, things, and then they cash in their huge paychecks and take more power and control.These two authors end up encouraging the very things they are trying to condemn by continuing to beat the same drum.Very frustrating read and only really worth the anecdote at the very beginning.I recommend trying Judicial Tyranny by Mark Sutherland if you want a better look at how the government should be run and what they are really doing wrong."

I got to experience them first hand while I attended college. A culture of safetyism - safe spaces, protesting and removing guest lecturers, microaggressions, victimization of everything, etc, etc, etc - festered when I was just arriving and thrived by the time I left. And it’s only gotten worse since. Students, parents, faculty. It’s everywhere. Free speech does not mean what it used to on college campuses. The book has experienced somewhat of reawakening with the Israel-Hamas War, explaining how students on campus have become so radicalized in their ways and how they could possibly justify terrorism. A must-read for parents on how to instill ‘anti-fragility’ in your children. Will bookshelf and re-read when we are expecting :) "

Anyway, the authors explain things very well, with nice little summaries at the end of each chapter, and they don't just bemoan the current state of things, but end with helpful suggestions for where to go from here to improve things. Even for those who aren't interested in higher education, this book is helpful in understanding American culture overall and some of the current political climate."
193,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34426-shawn,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is an important book that explains many of our contemporary social and academic ills. It argues that battles over freedom of expression, increasing anxiety and depression in youth, and political polarization are all connected to a set of ideas about childhood and educational practices. The book fits with many of my priors, so that likely colors how I think about it. Nevertheless, the arguments presented here are worth examining and exploring.Lukianoff and Haidt identify three ideas, what they call Great Untuths, that are main culprits:

   The Untruth of Fragility: the idea the kids are easily damaged or harmed. Parents and society must protect kids from any and all dangers and risks. 
  

   The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings: if you feel it to be true, it must be true. 
  

   The Untruth of Us vs. Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. We are always pitted against another tribe that is out to destroy us. 
 The gist of their argument is that these untruths took root in the 80s and led parents, teachers, and even children themselves to think that kids need constant monitoring and protection from all kinds of dangers and risks. This ‘safetyism’ led to reductions in free play, making it harder for kids to develop interpersonal conflict skills, personal risk assessment, self-confidence, and self-reliance. Moreover, the actual effects of these well-intentioned motives to protect kids made them more anxious and more at risk since they didn’t learn how to deal with potentially dangerous and risky situations. These untruths also encouraged various distorted ways of thinking about one’s self and others, leading to greater anxiety and depression, as well as a perception that disagreement about ideas and values posing a threat to one’s well-being and identity. If you think you are fragile and easily harmed, and think your feelings are an adequate guide to truth, then someone else expressing a different set of ideas can easily be interpreted as an existential threat from which you need protection. When the kids raised under these untruths — the so-called iGen or Generation Z — went to college they bring these distorted ways of thinking and demands for protection with them. The argument continues that these trends combined with other trends in parenting, education, and various concerns about social justice is what has lead to the conflicts we see on campuses and elsewhere today. Haidt and Lukianoff marshall social science evidence to make their case, building their arguments on their respective experiences in psychology, education, and parenting. I find it convincing and conclusive, but you should read the book to evaluate their arguments yourself. As a college educator, I see a lot of what Haidt and Lukianoff are talking about. I see it in the attitudes and behaviors of my students. I also see it in the reactions of university administration and how it tries to respond to the demands and needs of these students. And to be honest, I see it it in my son and my own parenting.One of the aspects I like about the book is its positive outlook. Though they are diagnosing and describing disturbing trends, they don’t see impending doom or catastrophe. They challenge us to see the counters to the untruths: 
   Kids are anti-fragile: they need to be exposed to and adapt to their environment so that they can deal with the inherent risks in that environment. “Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child” 
  

   Emotional reasoning is fraught with bias and error: we need to be careful about the judgments we make and be aware of the cognitive biases we may have. 
  

   Tribalism is a dangerous way to approach life, often leading to greater conflict. Better to learn to use our inherent tribal instincts to reduce conflict by working to see our common identity.  
 By recognizing these truths, Haidt and Lukianoff provide a path out of the current state of things. They leave the reader with both hope and a set of intellectual tools.The book itself is accessible and a quick read. There is a lot of interesting and useful information, especially for parents and educators. This is not an academic book. Indeed, I think academics might find it a bit thin in some regards. There are plenty of sources and citations, but it is not written to satisfy the demands of academic rigor and comprehensiveness. But that’s not what Haidt and Lukianoff are looking to do here. It is more of a self-help guide for parents and educators. To help us see the problem and provide some advice on how to change and adjust our practices. In that regard, they are successful."
194,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3949130-lizzie-jones,Rating 5 out of 5,"Incredible. One of the best books I've ever read. I'd give it 6 stars. Heck, I'd give it 8. Every chapter completely blew my mind. Many books I read offer supplemental material and links to websites and other reading. This is probably the first time I've ever actually looked up all the extra material. I looked at every video, every interview, every resource offered. This book was incredibly well-written and well-researched. It was organized and easy to follow. I listened to the book and this was also the first time I ever utilized the ""bookmark"" function on the audio book listening app I use. There was so much I wanted to remember and go back to. I got this book from the library and only a few chapters in I actually got online and bought myself both the physical hardbound copy AND the audio version, which I don't think I've ever done before. So what was so interesting? In short, everything. I happened to get this book from the library in early June, just as the country was entering a very desperate and devastating stage. I kept having to check when the book was published (late 2018) because it sounded like it had been published only days before given the things they were concerned about and the questions they were asking. If I had to describe this book in one word, it would be ""relevant."" This is a parenting book and a business book and a social psychology book and a clinical psychology book and a self-help book and a history book all in one. It talks a great deal about what parents can do to better raise their children to be self-sufficient, confident, and to fight their own battles. They talk about how helicopter parenting has gone to an all-time extreme and that, because of that, the culture of safetyism is dramatically changing the way children grow up. Safetyism is a culture or belief system in which safety (which includes ""emotional safety"") has become a sacred value, which means that people become unwilling to make trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. This causes children, teens, and young adults to avoid discomfort in many important forms. The authors blame this phenomenon for the overuse the college students of today being incapable and unwilling to confront anything remotely disquieting. Students protesting, sometimes violently, against certain speakers or certain professors or certain ideologies, for example, shows their incapability of dealing with opinions and viewpoints different to their own. I taught on a college campus for 5 years. I've seen this in action. I've seen students that are unable and unwilling to even consider the other side of an argument and as an educator I found it entirely unacceptable. I also see this every single day in the media and in politics and virtually everywhere else. People. don't. know. how. to. disagree. appropriately. It is a problem of monumental proportions and it needs to be addressed. In this book, they address the heck out of it. The authors also talk about the overuse of terms like PTSD, micro-aggressions, and trigger words. While all of these things are perfectly legitimate, they lose some of their power when usurped and commandeered by the uncomfortable rather than rightfully owned by the truly traumatized. They cover in the importance of political diversity and talk about the echo chambers that are very much a problem now, especially on college campuses. They cover the dangers of black and white thinking among other logical fallacies, and they talk in great deal about HOW TO FIX ALL THIS. The most interesting part of the book for me was the section about what happened at Evergreen University. I was not aware of what happened there and it entirely blew my mind. I was aware of the story they shared about the Halloween debate at Yale and I actually would teach a class on that one story to my college freshmen to talk to them about how to appropriately engage with an opposing viewpoint. The Evergreen case was 20 times worse than what happened at Yale. I though the authors were especially fair and pragmatic in their approaches. They acknowledged differing viewpoints and did very well to stick to proven data and true and factual accounts of real stories. I appreciated that even though I differ politically from both of these men, they still handled all political discussion with a great deal of respect. I thought their points were truly ground-breaking and I cannot recommend this book highly enough. One of the best and most influential books I've read in several years.

198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21680805-noah,Rating 5 out of 5,"Students were beginning to demand protection from speech because they had unwittingly learned to employ the very cognitive distortions that CBT tries to correct. Stated simply: Many university students are learning to think in distorted ways, and this increases their likelihood of becoming fragile, anxious, and easily hurt.Many parents, K-12 teachers, professors, and university administrators have been unknowingly teaching a generation of students to engage in the mental habits commonly seen in people who suffer from anxiety and depression. We suggested that students were beginning to react to words, books, and visiting speakers with fear and anger because they had been taught to exaggerate danger, use dichotomous (or binary) thinking, amplify their first emotional responses, and engage in a number of other cognitive distortions.By shielding children from every possible risk, we may lead them to react with exaggerated fear to situations that aren't risky at all and isolate them from the adult skills that they will one day have to master. [Gopnik]Many of the important systems in our economic and political life are like our immune systems: they require stressors and challenges in order to learn, adapt, and grow. Systems that are antifragile become rigid, weak, and inefficient when nothing challenges them or pushes them to respond vigorously.The culture of safetyism is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human nature and of the dynamics of trauma and recovery... Avoiding triggers is a symptom of PTSD, not a treatment for it.Trigger warnings are counter-therapeutic because they encourage avoidance of reminders of trauma, and avoidance maintains PTSD... [evidence-based, cognitive-behavioral therapies] involve gradual, systematic exposure to traumatic memories until their capacity to trigger distress diminishes. [McNally]A culture that allows the concept of ""safety"" to creep so far that it equates emotional discomfort with physical danger is a culture that encourages people to systematically protect one another from the very experiences embedded in daily life that they need in order to become strong and healthy.Like the immune system, children must be exposed to challenges and stressors (within limits, and in age-appropriate ways), or they will fail to mature into strong and capable adults, able to engage productively with people and ideas that challenge their beliefs and moral convictions.Unfortunately, when Sue included ""unintentional"" slights [in his definition of microaggressions], and when he defined the slights entirely in terms of the listener's interpretation, he encouraged people to make such misperceptions. He encouraged them to engage in emotional reasoning - to start with their feelings by drawing the conclusion that someone has committed an aggression against them... But it is not a good idea to start by assuming the worst about people and reading their actions as uncharitably as possible. This is the distortion known as mind reading; if done habitually and negatively, it is likely to lead to despair, anxiety, and a network of damaged relationships.Something began changing on many college campuses around 2013, and the idea that college students should not be exposed to ""offensive"" ideas is now a majority position on campus. In 2017, 58% of college students said it is ""important to be part of a college community where I am not exposed to intolerant and offensive ideas.""Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think. [Gray]The number of efforts to ""disinvite"" speakers from giving talks on campus has increased in the last few years; such efforts are often justified by the claim that the speaker in question will cause harm to students. But discomfort is not danger. Students, professors, and administrators should understand the concept of antifragility and keep in mind Hanna Holborn Gray's principle: ""Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think.""It's as though some of the students had their own mental prototype, a schema with two boxes to fill: victim and oppressor. Everyone is placed into one box or the other.The bottom line is that the human mind is prepared for tribalism... Tribalism is our evolutionary endowment for banding together to prepare for intergroup conflict.The common-humanity form of identity politics can still be found on many college campuses, but in recent years we've seen the rapid rise of a very different form that is based on an effort to unite and mobilize multiple groups to fight against a common enemy.In calling for the dismantling of power structures, the author was using a set of terms and concepts that are common in some academic departments; the main line of argumentation fell squarely within the large family of Marxist approaches to social and political analysis. It's a set of approaches in which things are analyzed primarily in terms of power. Within this paradigm, when power is perceived to be held by one group over others, there is moral polarity: the groups seen as powerful are bad, while the groups seen as oppressed are good. It's a variant of the pathological dualism that Rabbi Sacks described in the quotation at the start of this chapter.Since ""privilege"" is defined as the ""power to dominate"" and to cause ""oppression,"" these axes are inherently moral dimensions. The people on the top are bad, and the people below the line are good. This sort of teaching seems likely to encode the Untruth of Us Versus Them directly into the students' cognitive schemas: Life is a battle between good people and evil people. Furthermore, there is no escaping the conclusion as to who the evil people are. The main axes of oppression usually point to one intersectional address: straight white males.In short, as a result of our long evolution for tribal competition, the human mind readily does dichotomous, us-versus-them thinking. If we want to create welcoming, inclusive communities, we should be doing everything we can to turn down the tribalism and turn up the sense of common humanity. Instead, some theoretical approaches used in universities today may be hyperactivating our ancient tribal tendencies, even if that was not the intention of the professor.Call-out cultures and us-versus-them thinking are incompatible with the educational and research missions of universities, which require free inquiry, dissent, evidence-based argument, and intellectual honesty.When we dehumanize and demonize our opponents, we abandon the possibility of peacefully resolving our differences, and seek to justify violence against them. [Mandela]No one should have to pass someone else's ideological purity test to be allowed to speak. University life-along with civic life-dies without the free exchange of ideas. In the face of intimidation, educators must speak up, not shut down. Ours is a position of unique responsibility: We teach people not what to think, but how to think.It is a logical error to accept the claim that harm - even physical harm - is the same as violence.The Stoics understood that words don't cause stress directly; they can only provoke stress and suffering in a person who has interpreted those words as posing a threat.I don't want you to be safe ideologically. I don't want you to be safe emotionally. I want you to be strong. That's different. I'm not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity. I'm not going to take all the weights out of the gym; that's the whole point of the gym. This is the gym. [Jones]Speech is not violence. Treating it as such is an interpretive choice, and it is a choice that increases pain and suffering while preventing other, more effective responses, including the Stoic response (cultivating nonreactivity) and the antifragile response suggested by Van Jones: ""Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity.""This is why viewpoint diversity is so essential in any group of scholars. Each professor is - like all human beings - a flawed thinker with a strong preference for believing his or her own ideas are right. Each scholar suffers from the confirmation bias - the tendency to search vigorously for evidence that confirms what one already believes. One of the most brilliant features of universities is that, when they are working properly, they are communities of scholars who cancel out one another's confirmation biases. Even if professors often cannot see the flaws in their own arguments, other professors and students do them the favor of finding such flaws. The community of scholars then judges which ideas survive the debate.The loss of political diversity among the faculty has negative consequences for students, too, in three ways. First, there's the problem that many college students have little or no exposure to professors from half of the political spectrum. Many students graduate with an inaccurate understanding of conservatives, politics, and much of the United States... Second, the loss of viewpoint diversity among faculty means that what students learn about politically controversial topics will often be ""left shifted"" from the truth... [Third,]... some academic communities - particularly those in the most progressive parts of the country - may attain such high levels of political homogeneity and solidarity that they undergo a phase change, taking on properties of a collective entity that are antithetical to the normal aims of a university. A collective entity mobilized for action is far more likely to impose political orthodoxy and less likely to tolerate challenges to its key ideological beliefs.But safetyism does not help students who suffer from anxiety and depression. In fact, as we argue throughout this book, safetyism is likely to make things even worse for students who already struggle with mood disorders. Safetyism also inflicts collateral damage on the university's culture of free inquiry, because it teaches students to see words as violence and to interpret ideas and speakers as safe versus dangerous, rather than merely as true versus false. That way of thinking about words is likely to promote the intensification of a call-out culture, which, of course, gives students one more reason to be anxious.We should all take reasonable precautions to protect our children's physical safety - for example, by owning a fire extinguisher - but we should not submit to the pull of safetyism (overestimating danger, fetishizing safety, and not accepting any risk), which deprives kids of some of the most valuable experiences in childhood.By placing a protective shield over our children, we inadvertently stunt their growth and deprive them of the experiences they need to become successful and functional adults.Play is essential for wiring a mammal's brain to create a functioning adult. Mammals that are deprived of play won't develop to their full capacity.The genes get the ball rolling on the first draft of the brain, but the brain is ""expecting"" the child to engage in thousands of hours of play - including thousands of falls, scrapes, conflicts, insults, alliances, betrayals, status competitions, and acts of exclusion - in order to develop.Parenting strategies and laws that make it harder for kids to play on their own pose a serious threat to liberal societies by flipping our default setting from ""figure out how to solve this conflict on your own"" to ""invoke force and/or third parties whenever conflict arises."" [Horwitz]""The fundamental cause [of campus intolerance],"" [Adler] suggests, ""isn't students' extreme leftism or other political ideology"" but ""a market-driven decision by universities, made decades ago, to treat students as consumers - who pay up to $60,000 per year for courses, excellent cuisine, comfortable accommodations and a lively campus life.""We both believe that the way social justice is currently being conceptualized and pursued on campus is causing a variety of problems and engendering resistance and resentment for reasons that some of its advocates don't seem to recognize. In this chapter, we describe some of these conceptualizations. We also suggest a way to think about social justice that makes it more likely to be achieved and that harmonizes it with the traditional purpose of the university: the pursuit of truth.Nowadays, when someone points to an outcome gap and makes the claim (implicitly or explicitly) that the gap itself is evidence of systemic injustice, social scientists often just nod along with everyone else in the room.If professors and students are hesitant to raise alternative explanations for outcome gaps, then theories about those gaps may harden into orthodoxy. Ideas may be accepted not because they are true but because the politically dominant group wants them to be true in order to promote its preferred narrative and preferred set of remedies. At that point, backed by the passion and certainty of activists, flawed academic theories may get carried out of the academy and be applied in high schools, corporations, and other organizations.But if activists embrace the equal-outcomes form of social justice - if they interpret all deviations from population norms as evidence of systemic bias - then they will get drawn into endless and counterproductive campaigns, even against people who share their goals. Along the way, they will reinforce the bad mental habits that we have described throughout this book.Nothing is of more importance to the public weal, than to form and train up youth in wisdom and virtue. Wise and good men are, in my opinion, the strength of a state: much more so than riches or arms, which, under the management of Ignorance and Wickedness, often draw on destruction, instead of providing for the safety of a people.

As a fan of Jonathan Haidt's work and someone who has been following this Great American Culture War for a long time, it really pains me to do so. I had great expectations. But this book is a mess full of speculation.Allow me to explain.1. The Three Bad IdeasThe allegory of Misoponos, a fictional Greek guru peddling gobbledygook called ""safetyism,"" is amusing but misguided. First, I truly doubt that the problem (and I really do agree with the authors that there is a serious problem) is limited to these three absurd teachings. Second, I'm incredulous toward the claim that this is a Generation Z problem. People rarely are more radical than they are in their early 20s—they are old enough to have understood that their parents don't have all the answers and not old enough to know that they themselves have even fewer. Students have always been radical in a way that reflected the spirit of the times. The hippie movement can't be blamed on smartphones and paranoid parents and yet the same radical elements can be seen in it as in today's youth. I'm afraid that the problem is far more widespread than the authors want to admit, and even if some of the students make a lot of noise, it is the society as a whole that is out of touch with reality. Just read any op-ed from any major news outlet and you'll see what I mean. 2. How Did We Get Here?The Polarization Cycle; Anxiety and Depression; Paranoid Parenting; The Decline of Play; etc—all pure speculation. I do agree with the authors that, for example, paranoid parenting is a major issue. I have lived in a Scandinavian country where it's not an issue. In fact, the parenting style is just the opposite and almost all kids walk to school alone since the age of 7 and are independent in ways that would be an absolute culture shock to most Americans. Yet they are just as glued to their smartphones, laptops, and other devices—and suffer from the very same hurricane of political correctness and polarization that is ravaging the U.S. (though with their local flavor). While I do find overprotective parenting to be a form of child abuse, and do believe that it has a role to play in this, the problem goes deeper than that. Thomas Sowell wrote books about the culture wars for decades and if you read any work of his (whether you agree with his politics or not), you'll see that numerous iterations of these ideological battles have taken place since the 1920s. Paranoid parenting has probably ruined the childhood experience of millions and explains the rise in female anxiety and depression, but the authors should have done their homework and do deeper intercultural and intergenerational analysis to isolate the real causes.3. Wising UpThis is an absolutely ridiculous part of the book and goes so beyond speculation that it can only be called yet another manifesto of parenting. If you are a parent who wants to raise your child this way, please do, and if you don't believe in the ubiquitous harm of screentime then don't make a huge deal out of it. There are tradeoffs to everything. Yes, face-to-face play is important but the debate about the right amount of screen time has been ongoing since the first black-and-white TVs became popular—and only the devices change. Choose a generation that is still alive and you'll find that their parents believed them to be ruined either by violent movies, rock 'n' roll, video games, personal computers, internet porn, social media, or smartphones. And don't even get me started with the idea of ""mandatory civil service."" If people can't coexist peacefully without euphemistically introducing a form of slavery to hold them together, maybe it's better to just let the society to fall apart. "
202,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5902527-ira-therebel,Rating 5 out of 5,"Some negative changes are happening in our society. There is a strong polarization, people are unwilling to accept an opinion that slightly differs from theirs and it gets harder not to offend somebody even with a harmless remark. It is especially noticeable in universities. This book concentrates on America but as it says same problems now happen in Canada as well.What makes it sad is how much we praise diversity these days and yet act against it. Diversity of race, gender, sexuality etc is a great thing. But the diversity that truly makes us strong is the diversity of opinions and ideas, the ability to look at things from different perspective, be able to debate them and with this choose the best direction. University should be a place where such diversity is praised and have student come out of it with a well developed view on the world. Hopefully this will change soon. I may be catostrophizing what is happening now because I am not very optimistic.This book is a great analysis of this problem. It is written in a pretty unbiased way showing how both sides of the political spectrum provoke each other and make the situation worse. It breaks down what exactly is the problem (the three untruths) and also gives an explanation on why this is happening. We learn how it gets harder in universities to avoid confirmation bias and what is different about the new generation which may cause this culture of safety and victimhood. Interesting how the generation who remembers the moments they played without parental supervision as best moments in their childhood also shelter their kids the way they do. OF course sheltering isn't the only thing that caused this, it is way more complex and the book is really good at explaining it. I was a bit less interested in the last part because I have no children so it isn't for me to raise them differently but it is definitely useful for parents.I have read Haidt's other book, the Righteous mind, and it was just as great. I would recommend people to read it as well. It shows a similar us vs them problem but looking at broader demographics.The only thing that bothered me, which is pretty minor and not important for this book but that I still want to mention, is bringing up Trump's ""very fine people"" comment. Look, I am not some huge fan of Trump even though it may seem sometimes these days. I was laughing at the idea of him being elected when following American election in 2016 because I couldn't imagine that he is in any way a good candidate. although it was for different reason than people who are against him now, I never saw him as a modern Hitler. But nowadays I end up defending him all the time because what he says is being twisted to make the situation look even worse and dangerous (as she says ""fake news""). The ""very fine people"" is the issue that bothers me the most because it is so easy to check, so I am a bit disappointed that people who wrote this great book didn't do it. He never called white supremacists ""very fine people"", in literally the next sentence he says that he doesn't mean them. He was referring to people who came to protest taking down the Robert E Lee statue. This was the intention of the event before it was taken over by white supremacists. People may say that them being against it makes them racist too but this would be incorrect. Even in countries that were part of USSR many people were against taking down the Lenin statues because they saw him as an important part of their history, and they weren't communists. In this interview Trump says that these people should not be seen the same as the racist who marched there. And he is right.But besides this minor problem I think it was an excellent book that did a great job covering this issue of our time."

204,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1336693-emily,Rating 5 out of 5,"2019 Review: 4.5 stars. I found this book interesting, the case well-developed and articulated, with well thought-out suggestions on what to do with this information. The basic premise encourages 1)seeking out challenges, rather than eliminating or avoiding difficult things; 2) freeing yourself from cognitive distortions, rather than always trusting your initial feelings; and 3)taking a generous view of other people, rather than assuming the worst about people within an ""us vs them"" morality. In a world of increasing polarization and a ""call out culture,"" the authors encourage seeking a common humanity over a common enemy approach. They also speak on the importance of political/viewpont diversity and why we need to interact with people who see things differently than ourselves in order to find truth. I also really appreciated their discussion on perceived impact vs intent, which brings to mind aspects of charity (giving people the benefit of the doubt and not judging). I will include a few other notes that stood out to me below, but overall I would highly recommend this book as both an engaging and important read. 2023 Review: I reread this for book club and it made for a great discussion. Reading about the intimidation, bullying, and attacks by students on college campuses was infuriating (especially the overall hypocrisy of intolerance). Unfortunately, I don’t think we’ve made much progress in the last few years since this book was written (as evidenced by the despicable attack by students and administrators on the Federal Judge who was invited to speak at Stanford Law School). The responses of universities in favor of the shameful acts of their students doesn’t give me much hope that that these easily triggered/offended students are going to change anytime soon. I liked Van Jones’s quote about seeking for strength instead of ideological safety. Our book club wondered about what happens to these students when they leave college. I wish we could learn more from the examples of Martin Luther King, Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, and Nelson Mandela. -“Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think.” -Hanna Gray (p. 50)-“I don’t want you to be safe ideologically. I don’t want you to be safe emotionally. I want you to be strong. That’s different. I’m not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity. I’m not going to take all the weights out of the gym; that the whole point of the gym. This is the gym.” -Van Jones (p. 97)2 activities that are significantly related to depression: electronic device use and watching TV5 activities that have inverse relationships with depression: sports/exercise, attending religious services, reading books, in-person social interactions, and homeworkscreen vs non-screen (less than 2 hours/day have no elevated depression risk; those that spend more time off screen, especially doing the activities above, are at lower risk)Pauli Murray - ""When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall drive a larger circle to include them.""6 interacting trends:1-rising political polarization2-rising rates of adolescent depression and anxiety3-a shift to more fearful, protective, and intensive parenting in middle class and wealthy families4-widespread play deprivation and risk deprivation5-expanding campus bureaucracy taking an increasing overprotective posture6-a rising passion for justice combined with a growing commitment to obtaining equal outcomes in all areas"
205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3777747-erin,Rating 3 out of 5,"There is a lot I agree with in this book and a lot I disagree with. He has several great points related to parenting about the benefits of free play for children's development, the dangers of overprotective parents (that's going to be me lol), the importance of limiting screen time for kids and more.He also discusses recent trends across American colleges and universities that are quite interesting and concerning. I agree that he has valid points about the effects of the corporatization of universities, where students are treated as consumers who are meant to feel comfortable and pleased, and where the influence of faculty has diminished as the campus bureaucracy has expanded. He also has compelling arguments about the need to protect free speech and promote university environments that are truly open to debating a variety of ideas. To a certain degree, I also understand many of his concerns about safetyism. However, there were a fair number of times when he made a claim that I felt like was not fully supported by the evidence he provided. I'll just illustrate one example. He discussed and praised Kimberlé Crenshaw's intersectionality theory, but then he warned that some variations of intersectionality theory are harmful. He mentioned the diagram that shows axes of oppression and privilege for gender, race, sexual orientation, able-bodied, age, etc. Haidt claimed that if you teach this to college students and have them reflect on where they are on these axes, then you're teaching the untruth that there is a dichotomy of good vs evil, because these axes are a moral framework where privileged means ""bad"" and oppressed means ""good."" But there's a clear gap in his argument here. He himself quotes that privilege is defined as having ""power to dominate or oppress,"" (not as 'dominating' or 'oppressing'). So he makes a logical jump by assuming that this is a moral framework, where privileged means bad. But by his own definition, privileged just means you have the POWER to oppress or dominate, but it doesn't mean that every person who is privileged necessarily does (though of course inaction can be complicit in upholding the system). In the way I was taught to understand intersectionality theory, being privileged or oppressed is not a measurement of morality. Rather, these axes just represent objective statements about where you stand on the axes in terms of who benefits and who doesn't from what society values. Besides, the fact that there are so many different axes on this diagram directly undermines the claim that it contributes to dichotomous thinking of classifying people as good v. evil, because people can (and most do) find themselves on privileged parts of some axes and oppressed on the other (which is one of the whole points of teaching intersectionality, reflecting on how various forces coincide). Anyways, I agree with Haidt's conclusion that we should all try to turn down the tribalism and turn up the common humanity, but I don't feel like he made a compelling case to support his claim that some interpretations of intersectionality theory actually increase tribalism.

206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1548214-chrisanne,Rating 4 out of 5,"This seems like a right-wing book, doesn't it? What would you say if I told you that it was written by two self-described ""left-leaning"" Democrats? What would you think about me if I said that their chapter on Social Justice was one of the best I've ever read? :) *This book was fascinating in many respects. Anyone thinking of going into higher education, or raising children that they hope will attend college, should consider reading this book. It covers some upcoming problems in higher education and the, often, unprepared students that enter it.I believe that it also illustrates an issue that Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America from the Culture of Contempt didn't quite cover. What if people don't want to listen or be loved? What if they want you to be their enemy? It also slightly addressed potential causes of mass shootings, depression, microaggressions, and the mob mentality that seems to be brewing in locations in the US (I loved their response to the response to the Neo-Nazi mob in 2017. It was spot on). Being a fan of CBT and familiar with Burns, I was struck by their comments on the ways that society often reinforces negative patterns of thought. To be sure, I've found that many of the people I knew didn't do that, but society as a whole seems to. Perhaps that is just the side-effect of advertising. It struggled in two areas. 1st: It overlooks one other facet that I feel worth examining in connection with mental health and emotional well-being--- Family structure. ** 2nd: I really didn't like the word ""Coddling"" in the title. It implies a negative pity--- which I don't think is called for because most people are, as the title goes on to say, doing these things with the best of intentions. That being said, to tackle the topic as they do in the beginning is a brave endeavor. Especially given potential repercussions. *Don't disown me Grandpa... ;) They do advocate for more conservatives on college campuses, but not for the reasons you'd think. ** See Marriage and Caste in America: Separate and Unequal Families in a Post-Marital Age, The Home We Build Together: Recreating Society, and Becoming Attached: First Relationships and How They Shape Our Capacity to Love."

I think the first thing I will say is that if I had have read it rather than listen to the audiobook, I would probably have given it 4 stars. This is not an indictment of the content, it's just that the way the book is structured would have probably been easier to digest if I read a print version over the course of a few days. The audiobook tends to get a little monotonous and requires re-listening to some passages if your train of thought slips.What I appreciate about this book is how eloquently it put to words a lot of things that I tacitly knew, but never really considered the ramifications of. Contemporary partisanship (especially in America) has fostered a terrible culture of retaliation, cancellation and us vs. them. The book does a great job at expressing how we came to our current social/political climate by discussing modern child-rearing, and how these children impact the world once they enter the modern college environment. They relate everything back to the ""three great untruths"" prominent in modern education. I wont get into them here, but they are salient and undeniable points that help to illustrate the problem.In my opinion, the beauty of this book (and the article that inspired it) lies in how impartial it remains throughout. Especially considering they are dealing with a lot of socially and politically hot-button issues, they remain neutral and show how the social and psychological underpinnings of a broken system impact both sides. None of us are immune to these cognitive distortions, but the book describes great ways to start demonstrating intellectual humility, and learning that it's okay to be wrong. The irony of it all is that you only have to go to the review section on this site to see how entrenched people are in their own opinions. Many will write off this book just because they don't like the way it addresses a single issue that resonates with them, or feel that their pseudo-moralistic stances aren't being taken seriously. I find that frustrating, but I appreciate that much of what is discussed are sensitive issues that can be hard to have an open dialogue about.But that's what we need to be having. To quote Jordan B. Peterson, ""Observing that something exists is not the same thing as defending it."" I feel that many of the negative reviewers of this book would do well to remember that. In sum, if everyone absorbed the facts and subsequent conclusions drawn in this book, it wouldn't necessarily sway them from their position, or even stop them from being part of the polarizing problem. However, it would be a step in the right direction for us all to at least acknowledge that these problems exist, so that we can work together to remedy them. "
208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33334689-tommy-kiedis,Rating 5 out of 5,"Something has changed on the campus of the American university. Students, particularly those of IGen (born after 1995), are more fragile (while safer than ever before), less given to critical thinking (and more driven by emotions), and more entrenched in an “Us versus Them” mindset (We’re right. You’re wrong). This book addresses what happened and what we can do about it. The book in a sentence (or two):“This is a book about wisdom and its opposite."" So the authors begin and end The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation For Failure. Greg Lukianoff and Jon Haidt are going to take us on a deep dive that explores the changing landscape of America and the American University. ""Labeling,"" the “call out” culture, “microaggressions,” the rising need for “safe space,” the loss of free speech, discomfort mislabeled as “trauma,” “social justice” misdirected toward equal outcomes rather than equality in distributed and procedural fairness, and “identity politics” that make for common enemies rather than true dialogue. Their goal? Wiser kids. Wiser universities. A wiser society.About the authors:Greg Lukianoff (Stanford Law), is an expert on matters of free speech and First Amendment issues in higher education. He serves as the president and CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE). Jonathan Haidt (Ph.D. University of Pennsylvania) is the Thomas Cooley Professor Ethical Leadership at New York University’s Stern School of Business. Both are self-described liberals. They lean left. Neither has ever voted for a Republican for Congress or the presidency. Their worldview is evolutionary. And they bring –in my opinion– some necessary critique to good intentions run amok in American higher education.My take on The Coddling of the American Mind:Lukianoff and Haidt published The Coddling of the American Mind in 2018. I think the need for it is greater than when they wrote it. Like former CNN anchor Van Jones (see video below), Lukianoff and Haidt refuse their liberal counterparts “a pass” when ideological issues violate free speech, when personal autonomy becomes the measure of “right and wrong,” and when group think replaces true dialogue. For the record, the authors pull no punches when it comes to the left and right.Overview: In Part I the book examines “three great untruths”:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.The authors demonstrate how these “great untruths” contradict ancient wisdom (ideas found widely in the wisdom literature of many cultures), contradict modern psychological research on well-being, and harm the individuals and communities who embrace them (4). If the authors have a bent, it is toward Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT encourages one to push back on cognitive distortions, e.g., catastrophizing– if I do this the world/my world will come to an end; mind reading– assuming one knows what the other is thinking; over generalizing– perceiving a global pattern on the basis of a single event; and negative filtering– prioritizing negative feedback. The authors note that Greg has suffered from bouts of depression throughout his life and has benefited greatly from CBT.Part II explores multiple accounts of “bad ideas in action.” The authors survey the growing accounts of intimidation and violence and examine modern-day witch hunts on campuses across America. They also explore the “whys” behind this rising phenomenon. Why are things changing so rapidly? The authors provide their thoughts in Part III:1. Rising political polarization and cross-party animosity2. Rising levels of teen anxiety and depression3. Changes in parenting that exasperate fears4. The loss of free play and unsupervised risk-taking5. Growth of campus bureaucracy6. Increasing passion for (social) justice and what that requiresIn Part IV, Lukianoff and Haidt offer suggestions for improving child rearing, K-12 education, and the university. As with the rest of their book, the work is practical and thorough. You can see portions of this summary in My Takeaways below.Two excerpts worth noting:The Coddling of the American Mind is so worth the effort. The day I started this book, my reading included Proverbs 23:12, “Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge.” Lukianoff and Haidt provide a generous helping of that. From ""The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning""Chapter 2, ""The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning"" connected with me, particularly as it related to microaggressions. I never heard this term in college but find it commonplace today. Citing Derald Wang Sue, microaggressions are ""brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults toward people of color"" (40).I appreciate the charity and clarity the authors brought to this subject. ""Aggression is not unintentional or accidental"" (40). Rather than assuming the worst, would we be better off, the authors ask, if a more charitable interpretation might be warranted by the facts? The potential for offense taking is almost unlimited. How should you prepare the students to engage with one another in the most productive and beneficial way? Would you give them a day of microaggression training and encourage them to report micro aggressions whenever they see them? To go along with that training, would you set up a bias response team – a group of administrators charged with investigating reports of bias, including microaggressions? Or would you rather give all students advice on how to be polite and avoid giving accidental or thoughtless offense in a diverse community, along with a day of training in giving one another the benefit of the doubt and interpreting everyone's actions in ways that elicit the least amount of emotional reactivity?"" (43). From ""The Untruth of Us Versus Them"" As to the staggering growing chasm between right and left (see data on pages 128ff), Lukianoff and Haidt offer this summary: ""Common-enemy identity politics, when combined with microaggression theory, produces a call-out culture in which almost anything one says or does could result in a public shaming. This can engender a sense of 'walking on eggshells,' and it teaches students habits of self-censorship. Call-out cultures are detrimental to students' education and bad for their mental health"" (77). This focus was also helpful in their conclusion when the authors suggested differentiating between ""common-humanity identity politics"" and ""common-enemy identity politics.""Amen to that!My takeaways from their conclusions: Here are a few of their conclusions that resonate:1. Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.2. Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded.3. The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being (See Jeremiah 17:9).4. Discourage the use of the word ""safe"" or ""safety"" for anything other than physical safety.5. Help students distinguish between a critique of ideas and a personal attack.6. Minimize screen time for all, especially teens (average is 9 hours per day; 2 is better).7. Including Viewpoint Diversity. This is really a safeguard to ""political uniformity and [political] orthodoxy"" (258).8. Discourage the creep of the word ""unsafe"" to encompass ""uncomfortable."" Differentiate between physical safety and psychological safety. I encourage you to watch this video of former CNN Anchor Van Jones.Explicitly reject the untruth of fragility: What doesn't kill you makes you weaker. A university devoted to the pursuit of truth must prepare its students for conflict, controversy, and argument. Many students will experience their most cherished beliefs being challenged, and they must learn that this is not harassment or personal attack; it is part of the process by which people do each other the favor of counteracting each other's confirmation bias. Students must also learn to make well-reasoned arguments while avoiding ad hominem arguments, which criticize people rather than ideas (258-9).  9. Teach productive disagreement (from Adam Grant, 240)* Frame it as a debate, rather than a conflict.* Argue as if you're right but listen as if you're wrong (and be willing to change your mind).* Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person's perspective.* Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you've learned from them.10. ""Concerted cultivation""- ""This time-intensive, labor-intensive strategy involves overprotecting, overscheduling, and overparenting children in hopes of giving them an edge in a competitive society that has forgotten the importance of play and the value of unsupervised experience"" (236).Quotes worth quoting:1. Education: ""Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think."" Hanna Holborn Gray, President of the University of Chicago, 1978-19932. Us Versus Them: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: ""If only ['Us Versus Them'] were so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being"" (243).3. Collision avoidance: One's voice grows stronger in encounters with opposing views... The collision of views and ideologies is in the DNA of the academic enterprise. We do not need any collision avoidance technology here."" Ruth Simmons, former President of Brown University and the first black president of an Ivy League university.4. Our best days are in the past: We cannot absolutely prove that those are in error who tell us that society has reached a turning point, that we have seen our best days. But so said all who came before us, and with just as much apparent reason... On what principle is it that, where we see nothing but improvement behind us, we are to expect nothing but deterioration before us?"" Thomas Babintong Macauly, British historian and member of Parliament in 1830.5. Wisdom and virtue: Nothing is of more importance to the public weal, than to form and train up youth in wisdom and virtue. Wise and good men are, in my opinion, the strength of a state: more so than riches or arms, which, under the management of Ignorance and Wickedness, often draw on destruction, instead of providing for the safety of a people."" Benjamin Franklin to Samuel Johnson, 1750.6. On raising children: Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child. Folk WisdomThe authors piqued my curiosity about this book:I had not read John Stuart Mill's, On Liberty. It's on order! Conclusion: Thank you Lukianoff and Haidt! Your research is solid. You treated the “violations” of both the right and the left. You offered critique, rationale, and perhaps most importantly, suggestions for moving forward. Read the Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure. If you are in higher ed, use it as a tool to initiate dialogue, the kind that moves us to help build wiser kids, universities, and societies."

I appreciated the clear explanations as to what’s happening and the authors’ theories as to why, which seem very plausible. Some of the material was quite familiar, as they draw upon the data from iGen, which I read last year. There are so many resources referenced in the book that I could easily educate myself more in any of their covered topics if desired. The most powerful (and new to me) part of the book was their explanations of the culture of safetyism, how violence seemed an appropriate response to the threat of a thought, and how witch hunts happened still today. I want to help this young generation come to a better understanding of the difference between physical and emotional safety, and how to react based on reality instead of feelings."

This is definitely the most important book today for college students, soon-to-be college students and new parents.Greg and Jon do such an INCREDIBLE job writing out a potentially controversial argument that even the folks they are directly countering might find it hard to argue against. This book is about how the radical left is creating a dangerous culture of building fragile humans and societal structures, driven less by fact, more by feelings. There is also a ton about the alt-right abusing this and creating their own sort of hell.Basically, this book is about good intentions gone bad. About the polarization of our already polarized minds. And more importantly, the susceptibility of ""untruths"" that are contaminating the developing minds of our youth, especially in the developed countries. The authors systematically and eloquently unveil and dethrone the 3 great untruths of today's age - (1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker, (2) Always trust your feelings and (3) it's always us versus them, ""good"" versus ""evil"". And their focus is primarily on today's campuses, especially on ""Gen-Z"" - not quite millennials but folks born around 1994-1995. I don't remember being so engaged and enthralled reading a book about psychology before. Throughout the book, I was somewhere between being disgusted and screaming ""preach"" in my head. I'd like to think I am not infected by this disease, but I am genuinely shocked by it. I have not been able to really communicate why or how this makes sense, partly because I am scared the radical left will pounce and partly because I don't have the psychological knowledge or the wherewithal to do so. But, Greg and Jon do, and they do so splendidly, with fact-based logical arguments that you have to be sufficiently delusional to not agree with at least a majority of what they are saying. For me personally, there two key takeaways from this book. One was CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) and the other was the resounding importance of everyone reading this book, especially students and new parents. With CBT, I think I have found a tool that can ground my irrational self-destructiveness with rational thoughts. And for the other takeaway, I have already bought a couple of copies for some cousins who are about to embark into college and am trying to get some folks from my family that are new-parents to read this book.It's a weird one this - recommending this book profusely to someone can be taken the wrong way. ""Anish, are you implying something?"" But, I guess that's the point. If you think I'm implying something, you need to read it even more. Classic circular reference that keeps coming around in my world."
211,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Lukianoff and Haidt have written a book that I think has the potential to serve as a very good starting point for further discussion and research on many of these sensitive but important topics that our society, families, and universities face today (with an emphasis on universites and parenting in this book).I've always enjoyed Haidt because of his research-based approach, and his pursuit of truth while being willing to recognize realities of diverse experiences and needs. This book is no exception, and I also appreciated the important experience that Lukianoff brought to the table.It has felt important to try to learn more as I've been listening to a variety of perspectives over the last couple of years. From what I've been able to gather, it seems to me that the time we live in, and many of the events we are seeing, are symptoms and effects of a long history of ""uneven treatment"" based on various traits and identities. Of course part of this treatment has been conscious, some of it less conscious based on ignorance. I however don't doubt that substantial amounts of systemic bias and injustice have indeed accumulated over time, in many (often intersecting) areas. A recent surge in the interest to increase awareness around this, and to work for change, has obviously lead to strong reactions and chain reactions across the political and social spectrum. I think the systemic problems are real and that the pursuit to learn more and seek to address them is important.What I think this book does well is pointing out the important principles and the wisdom that we want to strive hard not to lose in the process. I appreciate that the authors at least try to acknowledge problems that have lead to this movement for ""social justice"", I personally think the book may have benefitted from painting a more full picture here. But I do think their points are also important and need to be given lots of thought and consideration. Especially as they represent a more productive and fact-based critique of aspects of the social justice pursuit of our day (especially on University Campuses).I look forward to learning from the thoughtful debate that I hope will come out of this book."
212,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"An important, thought-provoking and well-written argument for taking the bubble-wrap off our kids (and, in some cases, forcing them to confront the difference between discomfort and trauma). The authors draw on a wide range of sources, though their main argument is simple - we're succumbing to a pernicious ideology of ""safetyism"" and encouraging our kids (their main focus is universities) to demonize those they disagree with. The simplicity of the core argument is unsurprising, given its roots in a magazine article, and at times the book feels a bit repetitive or padded. In particular, the chapter summaries give it the feel of a management book, though perhaps it's just cueing it up for book clubs.The six chapters in the second half offering explanations of the rise of ""safetyism"" are illuminating though ultimately inconclusive, and the one chapter on social justice (chap 11) feels rushed and incomplete. Ultimately, as explanations for their core syndrome, this middle section could have been one meaty chapter. As treatments of modern parenting, political polarization or the rise of the higher ed regulatory state these chapters are intriguing but lack nuance.These shortcomings aside, this book offers an important and impassioned argument against ""preparing the road for the child"" rather than vice versatile, and deserves to be widely read and discussed. I enjoyed it very much I'm sure I will be will be returning to it often."

They write diplomatically, with warmth (and evidence!) to steer parents, professors, students, and university administrators toward ancient wisdom (as also found in the contemporary wisdom of CBT).Fortunately, plenty will combat these untruths with folk wisdom: “Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.” Or, this insight from Buddha: “Your worst enemy cannot harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded. But once mastered, no one can help you as much, not even your father or your mother.” As well as this revelation from former gulag prisoner, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn: “The line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.” Lukianoff's and Haidt's contribution, largely an expanded version of their 2015 article in the Atlantic—""The Coddling of the American Mind""—is one of the greatest commentaries on American culture I have read in the past 5 years. Very accessible. They write with concern for the rising generation, hearkening us back to a focus on human flourishing while respecting the progress we've seen (socially, economically, and technologically). It's refreshing to see more centrists, independents, and broadly liberal thinkers pushing back against illiberal-progressive orthodoxies and far-right reactionary ideologies. They stand at the nexus of an optimistic orientation for progress (while avoiding its non-empirical excesses) and an appreciation for the accumulated value of tradition (while not remaining beholden to the past, for the past's sake). The world could use a lot more thinkers like Haidt and Lukianoff. The trends they warn against may get worse for a few years before they improve, but Lukianoff and Haidt remain cautiously optimistic. The arc of history is long, but it bends toward...progress (greater levels of human flourishing). "

This book helped me tremendously, and since it’s been a couple of years, I decided I wanted to read it again to see if my perspective has changed at all and if there’s more I can learn from this book. And just like the first time, this book is as great as ever, and we’re still dealing with some of the issues this book lays out.Lukianoff and Haidt lay out the three untruths that younger people suffer from, and from what I’ve seen, it’s quite a few adults as well. The untruths cover cognitive distortions that are going unchecked such as catastrophizing, black and white thinking, and more. When we consider words as harm and shut down conversations or topics in education, it fosters a culture of safetyism, and the book explains how this is a disservice to our children. I’d like to think that some of the topics they cover about freakouts and protests on college campuses have calmed down, but that may be an illusion due to the last two years of COVID.I’m still a major skeptic about social media being one of the main drivers of mental health issues and other problems young people struggle with, but the book lays out strong arguments backed with some good research. If you’ve already read this book, I suggest giving it another read. And if you haven’t read it yet, you need to. These problems have been around for ages, but it’s never been this bad, and we need to start making a change in our households, at schools, and in our society in general."

The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion
 changed the way I saw the world, but for a long time I was hesitant to read his later book, The Coddling of the American Mind. The provocative title hinted at an attack on my generation and on a culture in which I was, at the time of its publication, fully immersed. In the three years since, my perspective has changed, as I left the bubbles in which I was raised and educated and began to regularly interact with a broader range of people. By the time I read 
The Constitution of Knowledge: A Defense of Truth
 last month, which cites this book frequently, I was disillusioned with the illiberal strain of progressivism increasingly common on and off college campuses, and far more open to the message of Coddling.While this book does delve into political theory, I appreciate its grounding in the science of cognitive behavioral therapy, which Haidt and Lukianoff convincingly use to tackle three great ""untruths"" that have become increasingly widespread since around 2014: ""what doesn't kill you makes you weaker,"" ""always trust your feelings,"" and ""life is a battle between good people and evil people."" These ideas, to be clear, are not shared among all of Gen Z, but do predominate in the top-tier universities that churn out future leaders in business, politics, and media, making them disproportionately influential in our society and culture. The authors demonstrate how the ""untruths"" undermine the truth-seeking mission of academia and the mental health of students.Haidt's writing can have a hint of corniness or oddness to it at times (e.g. the use of a fictional Greek oracle in the introduction), but is an easy and enjoyable read. I would highly recommend this book, particularly to anyone in academia or university administration."
216,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3388338-lisa,Rating 2 out of 5,"The authors began with a plausible trio of premises but went on to use anecdotal evidence to support their points, cherry pick evidence to support their premises, and to use their opinions to over generalize beyond the facts. I strongly disagree with majority of their examples as they are rare occurrences. The authors neglected to state that the provocateurs on university campuses were external to the community. These individuals intend to evoke fear and anger and do not have the right to spew hatred. Free speech does not include lies and racially motivated rhetoric intended to invoke violence. If anything can be learned from nazis and klansmen it is that societies must not tolerate all speech in the name of free speech. If life has gotten more equitable for people other than wealthy white men it is, in part, because derogatory language is no longer as acceptable as it has been in the past. The trolling online and on campuses described in the witch-hunt chapter is rare and the authors ignored the fact that these disagreements have always been present. The authors did not mention the immediacy of social media that has escalated these differences. The chapter on mental health takes a reductive view of the issue as though screen time is the only factor in increasing rates of mental health diagnoses in college students. The chapters on higher education neglected the role state politics plays in university policies and the fact that the contingent faculty at the heart of each dispute are a new, inexpensive method of staffing university classrooms with people external to and less embedded in the institution’s community. The last part, offering suggestions to improve for raising children and improving universities is absurd. Maybe wealthy white people can take their privilege and take gap years but it won’t work for everyone. I’m also a fan of cognitive behavioral therapy but I don’t understand the prominence of this clinical tool in this book. How can it intervene when people are targets of death threats? The book is basically a 270-page opinion piece and in my opinion about two thirds of all they say is inaccurate or incomplete. "

218,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73029907-cav,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a decent read. My second from Jonathon Haidt, after his 2011 book  The Righteous Mind.While it wasn't a bad book, per se, I didn't enjoy it as much as ""The Righteous Mind"".The authors talk about the current PC run-wild climate of modern academia, but take virtually every opportunity to also talk about how bad the shadowy ""alt-right"" is, too.I think Haidt has somewhat red-pilled himself in the last ~10 years or so. But I get the feeling he's muzzling himself to a degree here, as he is still a prof at NYU, and probably worried about the witch hunts he talks about in these pages coming for him...The book centers on 3 ideas. As they put it:""This is a book about three Great Untruths that seem to have spread widely in recent years:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people."" This book also surprisingly contained a good bit of talk about cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Co-author Greg Lukianoff has battled depression for years. They talk about how CBT is a gold standard of therapy. How to recognize ""catastrophizing"", ""dichotomous thinking"" and ""labelling""; among other patterns of negativity. They even included an intense account of a near-suicidal episode he had.  The authors also devote a large part of the book to the concept of ""safetyism"", including the helicopter parenting that they theorize has helped cause a generation of fragile children who equate language they don't like with violence. I do like the way Haidt writes; he summarizes the important parts of a chapter at the end of each. Effective communication. Overall, I did enjoy this book, despite rolling my eyes a few times.3.5 stars."
219,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7236889-scott,Rating 3 out of 5,"Similar to the Righteous Mind, I appreciate Haidt’s deep analysis and study on moral psychology. He is spot-on with his analysis of Gen Z (or iGen, as he calls it). Even more prescient is reading this after seeing the devastating mental health challenges imposed during the pandemic of the last two years. It’s as if the coddled American mind shattered while isolated to virtual worlds. I Audible-d (is that a word?) this book while holding bottles on my paternity leave. Consequently, many of the points I’m taking from this book are concerning parenting. The history of over-protective parents that arose from the super-predator frenzy of the early 90’s was fascinating to learn about. I found myself asking questions like: wilI I let my boy roam the neighborhoods free with no phone to tether and track him? “Free-range parenting” was a novel concept to me. Will I lean into it? My head says yes, but my gut says maybe not due to the culturally-imposed expectations of safety-ism. I hope to overcome the natural inclination. I appreciated listening to this book in conjunction with Sandel’s “Tyranny of Merit”, which also talks about the over-scheduled, resume-driven lives of kids. In both books, the authors speak of the over-engineering of children’s lives in effort to have the most ideal college entrance CV. What happened to a childhood that optimizes on unstructured, creative free time? How can I help design my child’s teen years so that he has this freedom? What are ways to balance the culturally-necessary resume points?My biggest critique is that Haidt focuses his anecdotes on the world that he knows — college students. His examples felt a little myopic, especially when principles derived from his book are based on analyses of emails (and subsequent fallout) from college administrators at small liberal arts colleges. I would have hoped the principles would have been more broad reaching. But then again, it’s no surprise since he writes about what he knows and his lived experience, which is academia."
220,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104729399-nico-bruin,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book is good.I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested in developmental psychology, freedom of speech and the recent instances of civil breakdown at many American institutes of higher education. Haidt and Lukianoff manage to tell their story in a competent, honest and engaging matter. They hit the nail of the head on pretty much anything they discuss. I do feel they give the devil more than his necessary due sometimes, but steel-manning the position of one's opponents is vastly preferable to straw-manning them. The book is also easy to read without feeling dumbed down in any way. I personally flew through it in a little under two days.There's two things for which I'm knocking a star off however. Firstly, the common sentiment that this book is overwritten has merit to it.I found myself skipping all the in sum parts of the chapters. The fourth and final part of the book, ""wising up"", didn't say much that hadn't already been said. I don't agree with the statement ""this should've remained an article"", but this book could easily shed a few dozen pages without losing much value.The second star that I'm taking of isn't actually related to any criticism I have of the book. In fact I believe this book deserves a 4 star rating.The reason I'm giving this a 3 rather than a 4 star rating is a personal one. I am already completely familiar with pretty much everything discussed in this book. Hence I didn't feel I got very much out of it. It wasn't a waste of time or anything, there was still value to be had, but when you've watched some Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff interviews, plus a decent number of Jonathan Haidt lectures and have read all his books, you've heard the vast majority of it already."
221,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7208369-miles,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Coddling of the American Mind is a book that every American should read. While this was my first encounter with author Greg Lukianoff, I’ve long respected and followed the work of his coauthor, Jonathan Haidt. In the early 2010s, Haidt’s 
The Righteous Mind
 was one of my gateway texts into the field of moral psychology, which has captivated me ever since.In this new book, Lukianoff and Haidt team up to take on a host of controversial issues, including freedom of expression, outrage on college campuses, and the general culture of “safetyism” that is on the rise in modern America:""'Safetyism' refers to a culture or belief system in which safety has become a sacred value, which means that people become unwilling to make trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. 'Safety' trumps everything else, no matter how unlikely or trivial the potential danger."" (30)The Coddling presents a fine-grained examination of safetyism, which is driven by an insidious form of concept creep that equates emotional/psychological safety with physical safety. The authors combine a battery of empirical research with clear, concise arguments that demonstrate the downsides of conflating these two concepts, and outline a number of positive methods for identifying and avoiding this cognitive distortion in everyday life.Before highlighting what I found to be the most important aspects of Lukianoff and Haidt’s findings, a few words of criticism regarding this book’s title and cover. I usually don’t comment on such trivial matters, but in this case I feel compelled to make an exception. I think The Coddling of the American Mind is a needlessly abrasive title that will likely put off potential readers before they have the chance to give the book’s content a fair hearing. Combined with a harsh red cover depicting nondescript young people in graduation caps falling off a cliff like lemmings, I’m afraid this book will be written off by many of the people who would benefit most from reading it. I hope this fear is unjustified, and certainly don’t blame the authors for the unfortunate decisions of their publisher.Contrary to what the title and cover might imply, this is not an anti-left screed or a histrionic lament about how “snowflakes” are ruining American society. Lukianoff and Haidt’s tone is consistently civil and charitable to the opposition, as evidenced by this representative passage:""This is a book about good intentions gone awry. In…the book, you’ll read about people primarily acting from good or noble motivations. In most cases, the motive is to help or protect children or people seen as vulnerable or victimized. Our goal…is not to blame; it is to understand."" (126)In their attempt to understand what’s going on when good intentions lead to negative results, Lukianoff and Haidt posit three “Great Untruths” that they claim are enfeebling American society:""1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people."" (4)These Great Untruths run contrary to ancient wisdom as well as modern psychological research, and also harm the individuals and communities who embrace them (4). Lukianoff and Haidt pair each Untruth with a proposed psychological antidote, as shown here:One key to understanding why the Great Untruths can be so harmful lies in Nassim Taleb's concept of “antifragility”:""Many of the important systems in our economic and political life are like immune systems: they require stressors and challenges in order to learn, adapt, and grow. Systems that are antifragile become rigid, weak, and inefficient when nothing challenges them or pushes them to respond vigorously."" (23, emphasis theirs)When we seek to protect people from all possible dangers, we deny them the chance to exercise the inherent growth mechanisms that build up their antifragility and transform them into more robust, resilient citizens. Without strain and strife, people languish.Using myriad examples, Lukianoff and Haidt demonstrate how the Great Untruths can produce all manner of undesirable outcomes: unnecessary social acrimony; neurotic parenting; a fanatic adherence to safetyism; depression and anxiety; and even physical violence against innocent victims as a means of “protecting” vulnerable individuals and groups. These sections focus primarily on parents and young people, but will be engaging and useful for any curious reader seeking to shore up his or her own antifragility.Lukianoff and Haidt also have much to say about the touchy topic of identity politics. They distinguish between two types of identity politics: common-humanity and common-enemy. Common-humanity identity politics focuses on widening the reach of societal compassion with the goal of promoting equal rights and access to opportunity for all people, regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc. This approach, which was championed by Martin Luther King, Jr. and many other civil rights activists, seeks to overcome political division by positing our shared humanity as the most important (but certainly not the only important) driver of political and social progress:""The more you separate people and point out differences among them, the more divided and less trusting they will become. The more you emphasize common goals or interests, shared fate, and common humanity, the more they will see one another as fellow human beings, treat one another well, and come to appreciate one another’s contributions to the community. Pauli Murray expressed the power of this principle when she wrote, 'When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them.'"" (260)Common-humanity identity politics stands in stark contrast to common-enemy identity politics, whose practitioners succumb to the Great Untruth of Us Versus Them. This phenomenon is as old as humanity itself, and capitalizes on our native tribal instincts that crave an unambiguous distinction between in-groups (good people) and out-groups (bad people). Lukianoff and Haidt show how the practice of common-enemy identity politics on both ends of the political spectrum leads to a “call-out culture” in which intelligent political discourse degrades rapidly and heterodox views are suppressed. Other negative results include dehumanizing one’s political opponents, participation in violent protests, and cycles of mutual provocation that chip away at the political center and leave little room for nuanced and fact-based debate.Lukianoff and Haidt’s firm rejection of common-enemy identity politics and support for common-humanity identity politics is a great example of their readiness to compromise with those who might disagree with them. Given the recent idiocies that have been enabled by common-enemy identity politics on both the left and right, it’s becoming increasingly easy for pundits to reject identity politics outright, claiming that differences in identity should play no role at all in political life. Even if this is correct in some theoretical or idealistic sense, this approach comes off as ahistorical and dismissive of the perfectly legitimate grievances of minority communities and marginalized groups. Common-humanity identity politics provides a platform on which we can celebrate difference while simultaneously forming coalitions based on our common biological inheritance. Modern science has taught us that biological similarities trump cultural differences more often than not, and it’s time to bring that reality to the forefront of our political movements:""As a result of our long evolution for tribal competition, the human mind readily does dichotomous, us-versus-them thinking. If we want to create welcoming, inclusive communities, we should be doing everything we can to turn down the tribalism and turn up the sense of common humanity."" (70)The role of American universities in fanning the flames of political division is another hotly-contested subject that Lukianoff and Haidt tackle. The politicization of higher education is nothing new, but the most visible forms of protest that have exploded on campuses in recent years have taken on a new and particularly irrational flavor. The Coddling contains lots of good advice about how university students, professors and administrators can help one another take a deep breath and stymie unnecessary outrage and violence. Most importantly, Lukianoff and Haidt remind us that the main charge of a university is to seek out and disseminate truth, not to be a vehicle for social change:""Some students and faculty today seem to think that the purpose of scholarship is to bring about social change, and the purpose of education is to train students to more effectively bring about such change.""We disagree. The truth is powerful, yet the process by which we arrive at truth is easily corrupted by the desires of the seekers and the social dynamics of the community. If a university is united around a telos of change or social progress, scholars will be motivated to reach conclusions that are consistent with that vision, and the community will impose social costs on those who reach different conclusions––or who merely ask the wrong questions."" (254)Should universities abandon their allegiance to truth in favor of an ethos of social change, a great and powerful tool for enlightenment will become corrupted, perhaps irredeemably. People who denigrate the idea of truth and seek an activist agenda for universities, even with the best of intentions, are forgetting the fact that social change will happen no matter what––it always does. The proper role of a university is to inoculate the process of social change with facts and reason, not to direct the process itself or predetermine its outcome. Above all else, education should be about creating good thinkers:""It is challenging to think well; we are easily led astray by feelings and by group loyalties. In the age of social media, cyber trolls, and fake news, it is a national and global crisis that people so readily follow their feelings to embrace outlandish stories about their enemies. A community in which members hold one another accountable for using evidence to substantiate their assertions is a community that can, collectively, pursue truth in the age of outrage. Emphasize the importance of critical thinking, and then give students the tools to engage in better critical thinking."" (259)At its heart, The Coddling calls us back to a simple practice that, while it has always had positive utility, is now becoming a critical feature that will differentiate healthy 21st-century societies from lost or doomed ones. This is the practice of giving people the benefit of the doubt, of assuming the best of intentions (or at least neutral intentions) unless one has very good reason not to:""It is important to find out whether an acquaintance feels hostility or contempt toward you. But it is not a good idea to start by assuming the worst about people and reading their actions as uncharitably as possible. This is the distortion known as mind reading; if done habitually and negatively, it is likely to lead to despair, anxiety, and a network of damaged relationships."" (40-1, emphasis theirs)One of the pitfalls of the information age is that we suddenly think we’re so damned smart, that we can understand other people better than they understand themselves. We read books and articles that purport to teach us how to detect “unconscious bias,” and gobble up partisan podcasts that so keenly articulate the assumed stances of our political and cultural opponents that we don’t feel the need to actually engage with them. I am just as guilty of this as most people, but I’m trying hard to break the habit, as should all Americans.We can start with an enthusiastic revival of the principle of charity, and with following Lukianoff and Haidt’s rules for productive disagreement:""––Frame it as a debate, rather than a conflict.––Argue as if you’re right, but listen as if you’re wrong (and be willing to change your mind).––Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person’s perspective.––Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you’ve learned from them."" (240)Lukianoff and Haidt have offered up a terrific text that carries on the long American tradition of cultural critique; they clearly love America and want it to live up to its promise. Probably the best quote in the whole book is lifted from an interview with Van Jones, one of my political heroes:""I don’t want you to be safe ideologically. I don’t want you to be safe emotionally. I want you to be strong. That’s different. I’m not going to pave the jungle for you. Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity. I’m not going to take all the weights out of the gym; that’s the whole point of the gym. This is the gym."" (97)Fellow American, whoever you are, wherever you are: I’m hitting the gym.

It’s also about much more than campus call-out culture, going into the parenting techniques and university policies that not only make young people weaker intellectually and emotionally but increase rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, and suicide. This was the part of the book that struck me most: Identity politics that creates an us-vs.-them, good-vs.-evil mentality — as opposed to identity politics that creates a common-humanity mentality — is linked to negative physical outcomes in those who practice it. The first half of the book is very compelling; the next quarter is interesting; and the last quarter consists of recommendations on how to move forward. The book quotes Pauli Murray, a black and queer Episocopal priest and civil rights activist who, in 1965, at the age of 55, earned a degree from Yale Law School: “When my brothers try to draw a circle to exclude me, I shall draw a larger circle to include them.” Words to live by.

Haidt, as usual, has contributed to a book that is at once gracious and direct, to the heart of the issue: our social constructionism ideology is making our kids and society more fragile, thus (if you take the metaphor a bit further) more susceptible to diseases, of which, we used to be immune. It’s not every day that that two very prominent liberals, who have no record of voting for a single Republican candidate, write the most interesting and challenging book on the subject of free expression, antifragility, and social psychology that has come around to enthrall conservatives and liberals alike, in many years. Perhaps they are the once and future liberals we have always hoped would be amongst the “loyal opposition,” but as the cultural conversation shifts to a more antagonistic brand of scapegoating and “othering,” we need to stick together, for the health of the country and the virtue of our communities, individually and as a whole. The three great untruths in the first part of the book are worth the entire price. I’m going to use it, as I have with Haidt’s other books, to engage with my community to seek truth and justice in the (post)modern age of groundless identity. "
225,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I found a lot of the principles and stories in this book very helpful and good for discussion. The main idea is “Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.” It shows us how over-protective parenting (among other things) led to cancel culture. Specifically, it was helpful to have instances of cancel culture broken down to see why they resulted from illogical thinking, such as catastrophizing and labeling. And the parenting tips were very helpful, such as prioritizing free play in younger kids and encouraging debate and responsibility in older kids.However, from a Christian point of view, there were a few things that I would think about differently. For instance the authors highly recommend CBT and mindfulness as remedies for anxiety and depression, but I would obviously add prayer and reading the Word as ways to help us identify and counteract unhelpful thoughts. Also even the main point “Prepare the child for the road”—I agree with this from a biblical perspective, since we ask the Holy Spirit to guide us and give us strength. However, we are also called to pray and trust the Lord to intervene in our circumstances too, aka preparing the road."

They bring together research in psychology, internet culture, child-rearing and others to present a picture of the currently disenchanted generation of young people for whom ""safety"" is all encompassing. It's both very frightening (lose your livelihood because your face accidentally did a thing because you zoned out during a meeting and microaggressed someone in Generation Safe Space) and hopeful-- learning more about social media and device use can help people help their children become, in the words of Nicholas Nassim Taleb ""antifragile.""

With mental illness on the rise for kids/teens, peoples’ inability to tolerate other perspectives, and the decrease of free play + face-to-face social interaction, it only makes sense that we need to dramatically alter the way we grapple with what we consider “safety.” I also loved their points about diversity - is a campus really diverse if we don’t allow diverse points of view and differing thought? I was impressed with their ability to bring in ample amounts of research and evidence to support their points. I also enjoyed the “In Sum” part of each chapter, and the practical tips at the end (especially as a parent of an adventure-seeking toddler).

It gives you things to look for and ideas as to why people react the way they do as well as tips for helping kids that are growing up in the turbulent atmosphere.This is the first book/study that I have read on this subject. Definitely something to think about and a good conversation starter for engaging with parents, educators, children, or just about anyone interested in understanding today's atmosphere."
229,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105387858-stetson,Rating 5 out of 5,"Lukianoff and Haidt's The Coddling of the American Mind will be viewed as one of the most insightful and salient commentaries on the post-2010 trends in youth (10-30 years of age) psychology. The authors describe the ongoing evolution of problematic mental heuristics (i.e. safetyism) that plague our the minds of many young people in society. These mental traps propagate misery and acrimony, erecting barriers to productive conversations and individual maturation/flourishing. It makes for an engaging and thought-provoking read.Unfortunately, more people have not read this book (or the article that previewed it by the same authors) as it seems more and more people have minds governed by problematic, overly simplistic thinking (the three Great Untruths: fragility, emotional reasoning, and us vs them thinking). The authors' balanced and thoughtful warning should be heeded. "
230,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42233840-carissa-carns,Rating 4 out of 5,"“A culture that allows the concept of “safety” to creep so far that it equates emotional discomfort with physical danger is a culture that encourages people to systematically protect one another from the very experiences embedded in daily life that they need in order to become strong and healthy.”My generation is full of anxiety and entitlement that life should be a certain way. While I don't necessarily agree with the solutions this book offers that are based in psychology and evolution, I think the observations and arguments are worth noting.Though I know this world to be cursed with sin and the only real answer to many of these problems is found through the saving work of Jesus Christ, the author offers some valuable insights to consider as we think about our present world."
231,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58388199-vincent,Rating 5 out of 5,"Lukianoff and Haidt do a fantastic job at eloquently explaining the recent phenomena that we have been witnessing in today's culture. Rather than condemning the oversensitivity on college campus on ideological grounds, Lukianoff and Haidt provide evidence as to why this type of mentality is not conducive to our well-being. Haidt and Lukianoff defend this position by honestly representing the opposition and digging deep in attempting to diagnose the genesis of this new phenomenon. It's a must-read for anyone who is about to step foot on campus for the next few years of their lives as it presents a challenging argument as to why they should reevaluate the claims that has been spewed consistently by the oversensitive brigade who think they are acting in the best interest of society.

232,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9023834-ian-hammond,Rating 5 out of 5,"The authors consider the three great untruths: what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker, trust your feelings, us versus them. And they show how through encouraging safety-ism, which encourages cognitive distortions characteristic of these untruths, college campuses (as well as parents) are causing iGen-ers to suffer from a decline in mental health. Their solutions fall along the lines of personal, parenting, and campus changes in thinking and policy. Their solutions are generated from statistical research and cognitive behavior therapy, which in my view is an intuitively sound way to go about counseling sharing similarities with the nouthetic counseling I learned in seminary."

I will definitely be reading this again in the future and referencing it in discussions with friends and family. 
234,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I found this book pretty frustrating and I imagine some of this is from the editor(s) in addition to the authors. There was a lot that seemed inflammatory even though the underlying ideas, especially highlighted at the end, are moderate. The authors would often make an extreme statement and then walk it back, or talk about overreactions and then acknowledge that there have been times when extreme reactions were called for. It was hard to shake the feeling that this wasn't just another book harkening back to the ""good old days."" It's a shame, because overall I agree with them in a lot of places, especially about the benefits of CBT. "

They also offer suggestions to how to move forward and what parents and college administrators can do to help students become ""anti-fragile"" and provide them with the coping mechanisms needed to survive in difficult or uncomfortable situations.10/10 would recommend. There are a lot of statistics listed throughout the book, but they are used in a ways that aren't boring or distracting from their overall argument. Very well written! "

272,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Saftig som fan, sätter fingret rakt på G-punkten så det kittlar till. Ytterligare en av flera böcker som skildrar vår samtid och generations särdrag avseende samtalsklimat, vad som verkar vara ökande polarisering mellan ideologiska läger och en växande psykisk ohälsa hos vår generation. Diverse kausala faktorer diskuteras flitigt i boken (sociala medier (samt tillgång till internet hela ens liv), ökat inslag av ""safetyism"" både hos föräldraskap och vid institutioner och arbetsplatser etc etc). Boken finner sin nyans perfekt skildrad i dess underrubrik: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure. Jag tar dock bokens centrala poänger för att spä på mina svart-vita uppfattningar om världen och nedan följer, i sedvanlig ordning, ett raljerande om ett knippe återkommande ämnen/begrepp i mina ""reviews"".  Det finns tre centrala ""Bad Ideas"" som mynnar ut och förkroppsligas av diverse faktorer och fenomen, dessa tre är: - The Untruth of Fragility: What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Weaker.Idén om att barn och vuxna är sköra varelser som skall behandlas lika varsamt som fint porslin. Begrepp som safetyism och fenomen som safe spaces etc diskuteras här (och varför det strider mot idéer centrala inom KBT, även nämnt nedan). Två ytterst tillfredställande begrepp presenteras här, ett i synnerhet kopplat till denna ""osanning"" och ett som skildrar fenomen överlag genom hela boken i vår samtid idag: Antifragility resp. Concept creep. Förstnämnda beskriver hur människors psyke (och barn som små varelser) är snarare som system likt våra ben och immunförsvar: Det måste utsättas för skit för att bygga upp resistans. Går vi runt med bomullstussar hela livet blir endast ömtåliga i längden (finns mycket forskning som visar på barn som inte för lära sig uppleva och hantera sina känslor på egen hand i ung ålder blir sedan helt emotionellt överkörd av alla jävla känslor som slår till när hormoner och pubertetslivet kommer i full skinka. Finns inga som helst copingstrategier). Ett väldigt lökigt, men bra, citat från boken är ""Prepare the Child for the road, not the road for the child"". Släpp alla jävla utopiska tankar om att inget barn ska göra sig illa eller att ingen ska vara ensam; livet är för jävligt, orättvist och ett enda lidande. Barnet behöver guidas till att skaffa en inre kompass för att ta sig igenom det, så att det inte blir en liten self-righteous ""Hampstead Cunt"" som blir ""moral dependent"" av en tredje aktör (ex. en skitunge i skolan som springer utan att blinka till fröken så fort minsta lilla händer utan att ens försöka lösa det direkt med ens kamrat. Dessa är de, som boken argumenterar (mer min tolkning) sedan kommer till universitetscampus och arbetsmarkanden och börjar kräva sina rättigheter (utan ansvar) och får moralpanik så fort någon tycker annorlunda än en (inte nog på flera campus i USA där man inom Humaniora blir direkt uppmande av professorer (*** märkligt nog av samma ideologisk hållning) att skrika ner meningsmotståndare istället för att engagera sig i ett meningsfullt utbyta av åsikter och information. Denna ""osanning"" kopplar an till concept creep, som nämnt långt ovan, där begrepp har tillåts tappa sina ursprungliga, sanna, semantiska innebörd. Hot och Våld är sådande begrepp där våld har gått från att vara enbart av ett fysiskt fenomen till att det nu kan vara verbalt (och det i sin tur bedöms utifrån subjektiva och relativistiska ramverk (som passar narrativet)) vilket - återigen - är helt absurt om man sedan tar en titt på centrala idéer inom KBT (boken lägger ut detta klart och tydligt). Finns även andra begrepp som har tappat sin mening och blir därmed värdelösa samt korrumperade av dess urvattnade definition (och har blivit så för att vissa teoretiska ramverk ska kunna överleva och inte minst expandera sin ""förklaringskraft"" på saker som ""strukturella"" fenomen i samhället (dvs vad Pluckrose och Lindsay perfekt benämner som ""Theory""). - The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always Trust Your Feelings. Haidt kommer in här med sin bakgrund i moralpsykologi och metaforen kring ""The (rational) rider and the (social intuitive (irrational)) elephant)"" - Den klassiska! Hänvisar till The Righteous mind och The Happiness Hypothesis för att sätta tänderna i vad metaforen innebär. I kort handlar invändingen mot dagens lögn att vända sig till sina egna inre känslor för visdom och vägledning att moralfilsofisk och kunskapsteoretisk subjektivism är doomed to fail om man vill bygga sammanhållande, positiva och växande samhällen (surprise, surprise!). De gör även en sjukt sexig redovisning över hur en sådan förhållning till världen strider mot grundläggande principer i KBT. - The Untruth of Us versus Them: Life Is a Battle Betweeen Good People and Evil People. Solz. odödliga citat om att ""the line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every man"" (Bah, ish typ så) och en skön distinktion mellan positiv, universell inkluderande identitetspolitik (ex. MLK) och negativ, exkluderande, polariserande, primitiv, vedervärdig, smutsig, moraliskt underlägsen, tragisk identitespolitik (tänk frön från pomo via 90-talets shenanigans inom akademin och dess mobiliserande under 2010-talet). Återigen kopplas detta an till varför det hamnar i kontrast till KBT. Mycket annat bra tas upp och det Jonathan Haidt ska hållas för (i linje med Pinker) är hans fläckfria nyanserade resonemang vars primära mål är att beskriva ett problem i samtida västvärlden och sedan erbjuda lösningar som ligger i allas intresse att de implementeras. Om någon senare vän på Goodreads har lyckats ta sig ned hit kan det vara vart att nämna att mina reviews är 95% raljerande om 3-4 begrepp på sin höjd och oftast avviker kraftigt från vad boken faktiskt skriver om. Men boken är bra och högst aktuell: 5+"
273,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60138507-paul,Rating 5 out of 5,"Was almost deterred by the reviews saying this should have stayed an essay -- I've been burned too many times by books trying to make their wordcounts -- but I'm glad I wasn't and honestly, I think this is one of the most important books I've read in a while. The thesis is that the free speech incidents on campuses of the last ten years are not only alarming in and of themselves but that they are symptomatic of a much deeper and more troubling cultural shift towards ""safetyism"" which could have - and arguably already has had - far-reaching, deleterious consequences for America and the ascendant generation. By the end of the book, I'm fully convinced . I've only recently reckoned with my own ""safetyist"" tendencies. I was a sensitive kid, and in life I've had a tendency to practice avoidant behavior -- to avoid uncomfortable situations rather than confronting them and getting the benefit of learning from them. I didn't realize I was doing it, but in retrospect - having had some recent personal setbacks, and some CBT-esque therapy as a consequence - it's clear that I was, and that that behavior impeded me from making the kinds of good, hard-wearing decisions that would have improved my long-term outcomes.I think we ought heed the warnings of these academics closely, because after all, they are on the ""frontlines"" of this particular battleground. ie. They are the ones responsible for training the next generation and preparing them for the ""real world"". By their reports, younger students are engaging in alarming frequency in the kinds of cognitive distortions thoroughly taxonomized by the psychological literature on CBT - catastrophization, overgeneralization, emotional reasoning, etc. - which should be avoided in everyday life, much less in places that are meant to be bastions of free thought and free discourse.The authors stop shy of offering an out-and-out denunciation of the higher education system in America -- they are academics after all -- but increasingly I'm finding it necessary. The higher education system has become one of those rare exemptions, like the Church, that, because of some ambiguous but mutually-agreed-upon moral prerogative, is not subject to the kinds of oversight that other businesses are subject to. But make no mistake that higher education is a business. And because so many employers in America steadfastly refuse to consider uncredentialed applicants - or because we have no alternative means of assessing general competency - higher education is able to operate almost like a cartel. Any young person MUST if they have any hope of a bright economic future get an undergraduate degree. (How is this different from a Taxi medallion in NYC?) And higher education institutions are invested not so much in giving you a good education, as they are in convincing you that the degree is a sound investment. Inherent in this is the notion that the opportunity cost of 4 years of life and huge amounts of incurred debt is worth the loss of income or on-the-job training one would otherwise receive.It remains true (if only for reasons of cultural inertia) that the undegraduate degree is a sound investment (and assuredly so for the top 50 or so schools). But in the process of rendering this argument the universities are and have been inculcating the younger generations (including my own) with notions that are dangerous at best -- for example that learning is inherently valuable (is it? even when that learning has no bearing whatsoever on one's ultimate occupation?); that thinking or writing or talking is as good as, or equal to, effectual action (is it? can you think food into existence? can you think shelter into existence?); that the thinking person's life is the highest possible aspiration (and what if you need to work to live?). I would argue that the prerogative of education is not to promote scholarship per se but to empower the individual -- and that some of these notions are entirely counterproductive to those aims. This is not post-World-War-II America anymore. We are not experiencing a glut of opportunity or overabundance of resources. Many of us (especially those of us with student loans, although I'm lucky enough not to be in that camp) do IN FACT have to work. But it doesn't take four years of education to learn to be an electrician or a plumber, so the universities push humanities.I digress. (And for what it's worth, I'm extremely grateful for my own education and miss college like heck). If any one thing is to blame for the over-sensitivity of Gen Z, it is social media, and the authors make that point as well. The perpetrators of the social media takeover are at least witting (the quote from Sean Parker is especially damning, though I don't have it to hand), and they make better villains. And ironically, because they are by and large young (Millenials at the oldest) the founders of these social media superpowers are likelier allies to Gen Z'ers, even despite their millions and billions of personal net worth. Because the thing is -- and this is what really worries me -- this is seeming more and more like some kind of inter-generational conflict. That young people, who are much more savvy on the platforms that seem to matter most, are increasingly unwilling to heed the warnings or advice of the older generations. That ""life experience"" is being de-platformed in favor of... I don't know what. Memes? It just seems like a bad idea. It just seems like a bad idea to reshuffle the social order in that way.

274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126254733-sarah,No Rating,"It’s funny, I accept this work as the masterful unveiling of a new exhibit, recently cataloged by social scientists Haidt and Lukianoff, and forget that I’m the prop. I’m the college student, the Gen Zer, up for discussion. And in that light, this meta-analysis of datasets seems a little strange, like it’s as easy as attributing the problems of my generation to not getting to play outdoors and as easily solved as self-administered CBT. Partly because of their training as psychologists (or at least Haidt’s), the moral diagnosis of the book is closet utilitarianism: it’s very effects focused, to the point of admitting that it won’t deal with the bigger “why” or moral ramifications raised by the questions. So the question is just “what works?” and the criteria for an “untruth” laid out in the introduction is that an idea contradicts wisdom literature, modern psychological research on flourishing, and harms those who embrace it. These are very hastily sketched out and never justified. Examples from wisdom literature seem to be chosen willy-nilly, whether from Boethius or Solzhenitsyn. Flourishing is never defined, nor is the authors’ own definition of harm (although they do argue strongly against the concept creep which has rendered harm so hard to define). This vagueness is reflected by the ending, which is, to be frank, a little silly: the goal is to be “stronger, richer, more virtuous, and safer” (for what? From what? To what end?). The big ideas are that we should promote psychological strength through controlled exposure to adversity rather than protecting against it wholesale (as with peanut allergens in the 90s), allow kids to play unsupervised a little more, and step back from tribalistic identity politics, preferring instead a common humanity model. If this feels a little scattered, it’s because the authors are trying to unify various threads around the theme of “emotional and mental unpreparedness” exhibited by young adults as they go to college. They work backwards from case studies like Evergreen College’s riots and the race-based fervor at Claremont McKenna college to prove that something is wrong, and college students are disfavoring free speech in order to create ideological homogeneity and safety. But the authors do a masterful job of ducking and weaving around the question of where morality takes us (aside for the fact that it “binds and blinds”) so it’s a little jarring for them to speak so resoundingly on behalf of truth as the mission of a university. They don’t address per se the problem of subjectivity, scientific turmoil, or literary criticism that may have contributed to universities eschewing this mission. I have a little bit of issue with the authors’ pop-level reading and presentation of philosophy, particularly the portrayal of Boethius’ dialogues with Lady Philosophy as an exercise in CBT (um, what?). Bits and pieces of philosophers are thrown in (like Aristotle, for instance) as citations to wisdom literature, but the benefit of such a tradition is never explained or defended, nor is the choice of certain authors as representative. There’s a crucial element missing of the religious story interwoven with morality, and how this question of absolute truth or doctrine might intersect not just with vaguely great thinkers of some vague canon, but with specific, historical understandings of morality rooted in God and the church. Anyway, the historical sections seem fairly cursory and scanty. All that said, I think this book might be helpful in peeling back some blinders to its intended audience (presumably middle-class parents and liberal intellectuals in the elite institutions it refers to). Some of its advice may be more helpful or relevant than others, since the advice bullet points seem somewhat casually collected. It’s true that higher education seems to be facing a crisis related to maladaptive logical thinking and severe groupthink/in-group bias. How students want to be regulated is just as much of a question as how they are regulated, and the question of autonomy versus standards of excellence or control seems to surface repeatedly. All that to say, mob rule in a university is a terrible idea, and so is knowledge through violence, or redefinition of concepts to expand the concept of violence. And (as poorly explained as their idea of truth was) I found this quote particularly relevant and worth repeating: “The truth is powerful, yet the process by which we arrive at truth is easily corrupted by the desires of the seekers and the social dynamics of the community.”"
275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44464709-thaddeus,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was such an interesting and insightful read!We live in an age in which the new generation (iGen) looks and thinks quite differently to their parents and grandparents generations. Sometimes it can be confusing to try to make sense of things such as cancel culture, the seeming fragility of youth (sometimes pejoratively called ‘snowflake culture’), safe spaces & safetyism and how many words like ‘harm’ & ‘trauma’ have seemed to change both in usage and meaning. It can seem like this all came up out of nowhere all of a sudden. However, every ideology and cultural movement has its roots which are important to understand. This is where this book offers helpful explanations to help show the roots and understand the thought processes behind these cultural trends.The authors frame the discussion within the framework of the search for wisdom - which is really what is needed to combat a lot of the underlying issues this generation faces. They draw on several sources of wisdom - from traditional religions and philosophy - to help make their case.The book’s premise hinges on what they call the Three Great Untruths:1. The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker2. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings3. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil peopleThey use these 3 Great Untruths to help diagnose the problems endemic to and facing the current generation.The book is divided up into four main parts:1. Explaining the bad ideas of the great untruths2. Examples of the untruths in action3. How did we get here - 6 factors which contributed to the current situation4. Wising up - some of the authors’ recommendations for building wiser kids, universities and societies.Overall, I thought the book did a great job of diagnosing the problems and illustrating their points well. There is enough data to make their case compelling and thorough, yet not too much to make it feel like reading a statistics textbook. Some of their stories which were chosen to illustrate some of the untruths in action seemed to be pretty extreme - however, it does a good job of illustrating the end of these bad ideas. Sometimes, the incidents (though true stories) seemed too unbelievable to think that people can believe and think in those ways. But once one understands the ideologies behind - it helps one understand why. You may find (as I did) several moments saying “oh, that’s why that is so!”I really liked the framing of the conversation in terms of the search for wisdom - as that is really what is needed to combat this issues. I really liked the quote they used about parents encouraging their children to not be like candles which wind can extinguish but rather like a fire that is energized by the wind as they face the rigours of the real world. “You want to be the fire and wish for the wind.” Also, “prepare the child for the road not the road for the child.” The authors also offered helpful advice from Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as remedies to the three untruths. However, though the authors drew from other religious and philosophical traditions, there was not much insight offered from Christianity (which was noticeably absent to me). Christianity’s wisdom literature in the bible and its tradition of theology has much to say on these topics. But I also don’t expect the authors (who seem to come at it from a secular psychological and sociological perspective) to employ robust Christian theology. I think though, that a theologian could easily take some of their insights to help inform how they may be able to speak to these issues in our culture.Overall, this was a very worthwhile read - especially for someone trying to understand better our cultural moment and some of the issues facing iGen and being propagated everywhere around us through media, pop-psychology and academic institutions. The authors’ insights are invaluable, and they offer some helpful advice in the closing chapters for some practical steps which can be taken. However, I think that the solutions offered are a good start but not a complete remedy. I think that church leaders and Christians will find this a thought-provoking book that will help them consider how to meaningfully and strategically engage the culture today.Highly recommended read!"

I internalized a lot of myself and video games and books appealed to that internalized life because internalized adventures are safer, easier, and less constrained by reality. My Mom's sensibilities as a 3rd grade teacher allowed for unlimited book reading but excessive video games were frowned upon in my household. The older I got my dad started telling me stories about the adventures he would go on when he was my age, climbing trees in the local orange grove, riding bikes, etc. One day he said, ""When I was your age my friends and I would go find coyote dens and throw rocks at the sleeping coyotes,"" to which I responded, ""Do you want me to throw rocks at coyotes?"" and he replied with a parental party line, ""not necessarily..."" A day came when he told me he wanted to go on a bike ride with me and I started following him down a path I had been down many times on my bike. He took me on a turn off the normal safe Southern Orange County Government Maintained Biking Trail down an uneven dirt path that eventually led into an enormous field of wildflowers. At the edge of this field was a cliff so steep that falling would certainly imply death. Or at least that was my perspective as a kid, in retrospect it was about a 20-30 foot drop. A tall tree sat at the edge of the cliff and some local hooligans had drilled 2x4s into the side of the tree and tied a rope with a knot at the bottom from the top branch over the cliff. My Dad casually grabbed the rope, ran as fast as he could, and swung himself over the cliff, my mouth agape. He did it a few more times before looking at me, as if inviting me to join him. I gave a resounding but guilty shake of my head no, and he did not pressure me into giving it a shot. This was a solid parenting decision at the time because I certainly did not have the upper body strength to hold onto a swinging rope at the time and there was probably a 50% chance of failure. That day marked a turning point in my life of getting outside of wandering the world with my friends. We made it a regular habit of meeting up on our bikes to find childhood adventures that I look back as my favorite moments growing up, running through forests, finding rivers and jumping from rock to rock upstream, and catching frogs with my best friends. I have gone back looking for the field of wild flowers that felt like entering a competently new beautiful world, but it has long since been paved with concrete and someones home has been planted there now. I was reminiscing with my Dad about that trip and he told me that he didn't see a sense of adventure in me and wanted to instill that in my in my childhood. In my estimation, my sense of adventure lay under the surface where it didn't belong and bringing it out is one of the reasons that have absolutely no struggle with anything remotely similar to an anxiety disorder today, which may put me in the minority of my peers. As it turns out, according to the research in this book, excessive screen time has created an epidemic of anxiety and depression for an entire generation. The ""anti-woke culture"" sections of the book seem a little frivolous to me. It could be helpful if you are feeling pressure to think a certain way and do not know how to articulate your thoughts or feelings about the topic, but no one that I know who has made a decision in that realm is going to have their opinion changed through the ""facts and data"" approach, on either side. It is strange to see how quickly the ideas spread from being a problem with college campuses to the primary topic of debate for the presidential election. What I really loved about this book was the freedom I walked away with to raise a child outside of cultural exceptions to become strong independent individuals. I want to become the man who can do for my children what my Dad did for me. If anyone would like to come to me and tell me what my Dad did for me was a mistake, child abuse, or unnecessarily dangerous, they better come correct."

It is a very liberal school, and I got to witness the best of activism. I saw and participated in a student-led program to teach and empower fellow students on how to recognize sexual violence and how to protect each other. Several other student-led programs too, which focused on empowering the community - foster children, children in juvenile detention, homelessness, the elderly, etc. And, I saw a large Facebook platform where students of color could anonymously tell their stories of racism and intolerance in the community - in reaction to the recruitment lie the university told its incoming students. I saw the rise in education not just being about knowledge and preparation for the career field, but a call to action and activism. And it's inspiring and it's a good thing.The book focuses on a lot of topics I've been interested in for a long time. Consumerism, philosophy, politics, higher education, and children. So, why am I only reading it now? I don't know why, but I have this bad habit of thinking that if a book seems too interesting to me, it will probably disappoint me, so I should avoid it (fortune-telling). Anyway, I'm glad I read this now. I studied it like I was back in class and man, do I miss school.The core focus of the book is on those born after 1995 (old iGen, or Gen-Z) and who have been in college during or after 2015. It aims to explain several factors that have contributed to raise GenZ to be astronomically more susceptible to mental illness and mood disorder, and how colleges are now struggling to adapt to the increasing needs and demands of their consumers. Thus, they describe the trend of ""safetyism,"" or the use of cognitively distorted thinking (a term borrowed from cognitive behavioral therapy) to protect the generation's health and well-being from childhood to college. And this distorted thinking is spreading across our increasingly polarized nation. This is also a book about ""wisdom and its opposite"", and its connection to cognitive behavioral therapy. They frame the book as a warning to the ""three Great Untruths,"" which are very similar to cognitively distorted thinking, and how these well-intended Great Untruths are backfiring.The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.The book touches on a lot of different topics to show how there isn't just one blame, but there are several moving parts that makeup how we - and the generation - got to where we are now. It's not just overprotective parents or protective policies; the left or the right; social media and technology; and not just the emotionally devastating events witnessed by this generation. And the authors try to provide explanations for many of the attitudes we see today towards issues surrounding things like social justice, equality, identities, police, political parties, and why GenZ reacts to them the way they do. They also give advice for how to raise children to be more independent, and how to give dignity and autonomy back to students of any age.You can read their original essay here, which includes a list of the cognitive distortions."
278,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22356256-kyle,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book has a long title that probably sets out the thesis in too provocative of terms. The authors are clear that by ""coddling"", they mean ""overprotecting."" They then proceed to explain what they mean. This means that the ""three great untruths"" are being propagated through society, to the detriment of the well-being of people. These three problems are ""Fragility: what doesn't kill you makes you weaker"", ""Emotional Reasoning: always trust your feelings"", and ""us vs them: life is a battle between good and evil people"". They are careful to make their claims defensible (such as these are not being taught explicitly, usually), and try to stick to the data we have. I find their analysis reasonable. They point out that kids are not coddled in being lazy, they are coddled in being protected and that we now have ""safetyism"" as a problem. Safetyism means that we want to reduce all risk on some measure (say chance of a child falling and breaking a bone) by taking away beneficial things with low risk (children playing in trees and exploring the woods). They point out that crime is actually down, and so under most risk/benefit evaluations we choose the worse option. This seems to be true from my anecdotal experience, and they usher some data, but I worry that the data is fairly inconclusive by itself. They examine parenting, college, and society in general. I think they give defensible ideas for the causes of safetyism and some ideas that could help. They are put forth tentatively, and so I give them credit for not overstating their case. They comment on many of the cases of colleges having breakdowns (the protests against campus speakers, Evergreen, the Yale episode with the Christakises), and point out the mental health trends for college age students. Again, the plural of anecdotes is not data, but they are careful and I find their analysis fairly convincing. It seems college students nowadays are less apt to be as strongly free speech as of just 5 or 10 years ago. I also personally think that supporting free speech in tough situations is the right call, so maybe I am too sympathetic to their argument.Overall, I think they give a good, balanced discussion. They point out that many of the reasons driving us towards this situation are good intentions. My strongest criticism is perhaps that the data they bring to support their interpretation is never strong enough to go beyond likely. When talking about recent events, it is perhaps inevitable, but I think their analysis of screen time over 2 hours having a negative relationship to mental health is fairly weak (I was able to find a NY Times article saying that such a relationship is not established). They are not advocating for a huge change, but they are advocating for change, and so it's always better to have a solidly backed theory, and I fear there's is likely, but not beyond a reasonable doubt.I would definitely recommend reading it if you keep up on the changes on college campuses vis a vis social justice. They do not strawman sides. If anything I thought they tried to inject balance everywhere. The stories are disturbing by painting a picture of some movement by universities away from truth-seekers, but the authors are careful not to make this apocalyptic sounding (not all universities, and most would still say they are truth-seeking). The chapters all have nice summaries, as does the book, and so it is quite easy to see their main ideas. I don't think I can award a full five stars because while they are nuanced, some of the themes do feel a bit repetitive, and it feels to me as if they are trying too hard to come across as fairly balanced at times. The style is quite readable, though."
279,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64313150-andrew-figueiredo,Rating 4 out of 5,"I decided to read ""The Coddling of the American Mind"" because I felt like it might explain the experiences I had during my time at McGill and MAN was I correct. Haidt deconstructs the reasons behind and implications of the growing trend towards campus coddling. In a moment when cancel culture has extended to firing data analysts for tweeting out studies that don't conform with the ""woke"" position to forcing an overturning of the NYT editorial board for running a piece advocating for a position most Americans supported, this is an especially important read.The book centers around three central ""untruths"": fragility, always trusting feelings, and a Manichean view of the world. Haidt posits that not only are more young people thinking this way, but that university administrators, parents, and more push these untruths. Internalizing these untruths leads to examples like Charles Murray at Middlebury, the Evergreen State saga, and the riots at Berkeley. Identity becomes weaponized in a way that bolsters tribal attachment, instead of bringing people together around shared values. Speech, framed as violence, becomes easy censor on campus. Spirals of polarization result and academia adopt a self-radicalizing lens that discards the importance of real discussion. Normally, a back-and-forth leads to institutionalized disconfirmation. But under a system guided by untruths, an echo chamber results. The causes are varied: polarization, anxiety, helicopter parenting, decline in free play, expanding campus bureaucracy, passion for social justice, and changing notions of justice itself (towards equal outcomes). I was happy to see well-researched explanations on these points, as they go well beyond the ""political correctness"" the right often laments. I tend to agree with most of the causes, and Haidt doesn't make them all out to be uniformly negative. In fact, things like ""bias response"" emerged from the right intention but focused on the wrong issues. He sifts through the nuance, for example noting the importance of improved safety devices for children while lamenting parents' refusal to let kids be more independent. This adds credibility to an argument that in the media is often overly simplistic. One thing I loved is how the author sums up each chapter at the end. Because it's a quick-yet-applicable read, it's nice to go back and review key points.To his credit, Haidt isn't all problem-no solution. He gives tons of solutions for parents, students, and school administrators. Granted, I think some of the ""solutions"" would be ineffective and some are very vague, but it's good that he proposes them. Other ideas, like cross-partisan events on campus, are essential to revitalizing American academic culture. This is something I work on in my own life. Indeed, our campuses and social spaces would very much benefit from Haidt's approach to discourse. I become more convinced of it by the day."

I kept trying to guess if the authors leaned one way or the other politically. I'm nonpartisan since I find it hard to align fully with either side and was beginning to think they might feel the same. When they finally stated they were both more in line with the Democratic party I was a little surprised. If I had to say I lean one way more than the other I would likely say that I lean towards the Republican party. I don't believe this matters much though. This book is not about politics. The problems discussed throughout this book are exactly what our nation needs right now.Haidt and Lukianoff describe three 'great untruths' being rampantly spread across America, mostly perpetuated on college campuses and through social media. The 'great untruths' are; what doesn't kill you makes you weaker, always trust your feelings, and life is a battle between good people and evil people.I could write forever explaining these untruths but it would be best for you to read Haidt's and Lukianoff's words. I'll just share a few words and terms I learned from my reading of this book.Direct quotes:“...turn down the tribalism and up the sense of common humanity."""" Call-out cultures are detrimental to student's education and bad for their mental health. Call out cultures and us versus them thinking are incompatible with the educational and research missions of the universities which require free inquiry, descent, evidence-based argument and intellectual honesty.""""... take the stoic response and remain unmoved. As Marcus Aurelius advised, 'Choose not to be harmed and you won't feel harmed. Don't feel harmed and you haven't been.' The more ways your identity can be threatened by casual daily interactions, the more valuable it will be to cultivate the stoic and Buddhist and CBT ability to not be emotionally reactive, to not let others control your mind and your cortisol levels.""Thoughts I wrote down: An educational institution's role is to help facilitate critical thinking not to ensure no discomfort is ever felt. Discomfort does not equal danger.We as individual human beings are not inherently fragile. We are resilient! Let's not treat the youth today as fragile. Doing so will only cause them harm in the future.Give people the benefit of the doubt. Practice the principle of charity, have empathy.Hostile attribution bias = the tendency to interpret others' behaviors as having hostile intent, even when the behavior is ambiguous or benign."
281,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was an eye-opening, illuminating examination of the current state of affairs largely on campuses of elite universities, but also more broadly our culture and the rising generation (referred to as iGen by the authors and the research they reference). I felt like this book put its finger on many issues that frustrate me but that I couldn’t even adequately articulate. I’m often exasperated at how annoyed/embarrassed/incredulous I feel towards the rhetoric and behavior of people who I actually agree with politically, and this felt like it was reading my mind and providing much needed context and explanation for why that is. The authors argue that several parties within the last few years have had harmless, even laudable intentions: students/young people with a passionate commitment to social justice, parents who want to raise happy, high-achieving, safe children, and university administrators who want to create an academic environment that serves its students well and fosters a culture where every student feels heard and valued. In pursuit of these noble aims, however, several trends have begun that promote counterproductive and sometimes destructive methods and modes of thinking to achieve those goals. They liken these misguided processes to common cognitive distortions found in cognitive behavioral therapy. It’s a fascinating hypothesis, and they have no shortage of examples to provide evidence for their theory. They’re on strongest ground when examining the psychological ramifications, with the sociological feeling more reaching, and the political being a bit dubious. And their focus is strongest when it’s restricted to the university, perhaps because it is a much more uniform environment than the entire country/culture. It was also very interesting reading much of their opinions after having recently read Robin DiAngelo’s White Fragility. Many could argue that these two authors are writing from a place of extreme privilege, and reaching conclusions that serve to reinforce their privilege. I’m not sure I’d ultimately agree with such an assessment, but there were a couple of times in the course of reading it that I felt it was rearing its head. However, even if that is true, I’m not sure that it actually invalidates any of the arguments they put forth. And regardless, they’re diving into such thorny but deeply interesting concepts that it makes for fantastic reading, and spurs the imagination on towards many more topics. "
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32583028-nore,Rating 3 out of 5,"When this book was published, it may still have been possible to claim that cancel culture wasn't real and that the left wasn't attempting censorship; I think it's increasingly difficult to hold to that view when people are being fired from their jobs for tweeting peer-reviewed studies from black scholars that contradict common wisdom on the left, Mexican American men are being fired for cracking their knuckles because a white liberal thought he was making a white power sign, and a liberal woman who has been wrong before has an entire Twitter thread where she doxxes teens as young as 16, 17 years old and encourages her followers to ruin their entire lives because of stupid shit they've said online. People on the left lie and misinterpret what even their fellow leftists are saying in order to chase clout on the internet and look Woker Than Thou.I can't even express confusion about what's going on without being disingenuous, because it wasn't too long ago that I was part of this sort of outrage culture; despite my reservations about the viciousness I saw in some of my fellows, I rarely said anything to anyone. The biggest mistake this book makes is in assuming that this problem doesn't extend past college campuses - it does. Colleges aren't even the hottest locus for this culture anymore. This is the culture of almost every online leftist circle I've been in within the past eight years or so, hyper-focused on finding things problematic, unable to relax, treating every emotional reaction like a valid justification for claiming bigotry. My experience is biased - I am an extremely online person - but my experience is not terribly uncommon these days.I liked this book, but I'm not sure what else to say about it. What the authors point out as a problem in this book has mushroomed into absolutely bananas behaviour in the space of two years, and through no fault of its own, that's its weakness - it can't address what this problem has become because the problem has intensified to a startling degree. The advice the authors suggest (more unsupervised free time in childhood, teaching children to recognize and combat cognitive distortions, etc.) is fantastic, and hopefully, future generations will be raised with an eye to the problems of today; but it's a bit too little, too late. All we can do right now is hope that enough people realize how damaging the New Left can be to its own cause."
283,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7918888-michael,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a 5 star book with some 2 star moments. First, the negatives. I don't think Haidt has quite understood the hurt and frustration of minority groups. He delves into this, but he never quite gets there. I've spent a lot of time reading about this, discussing with others, and pondering why someone could feel and act so strongly one way, while it presents to other people as 'completely absurd'. I tend not to assume people are absurd, and that there are reasons they're acting a certain way, but it's not always clear what their starting assumptions are. The video of Nicholas Christakis being confronted by Yale students is a pretty good example of people not getting each other, at all. Haidt repeats a lot that it's not true that what doesn't kill you makes you weaker, and he says that people shouldn't be protected from ideas, and college campuses should welcome diversity of ideas. While I agree, there's a strong case to be made that ideas have consequences, and minority groups are often the victims of the ideas of the powerful. Many 'ideas' have been couched as intellectual and academic explorations while in effect causing oppression and hurt to the less powerful. Haidt might struggle to 'feel' how this works, since he is not part of an oppressed minority. But if aliens invaded and subdued humans, and then wanted to 'discuss' topics that potentially caused more suffering to humans, would Haidt be so supportive of unrestrained philosophising? This topic requires more nuance, and probably more heart-to-heart listening of those on the 'other side' than this book gives it.But the 'good' in this book is quite good. Extra points for his summaries at the end of each section, and for giving practical solutions at the end.I resonate with the idea that colleges are not there to make people safe, but to make people learn. I see the dangers in over-protecting kids. Too safe is unsafe, and causes them harm in the long run.Haidt helpfully identified many examples of 'concept creep' and 'catastophising', and I'll probably incorporate these into my thinking more. I also see the negative effects of good v evil thinking. Good/evil is an essentialist concept. It's unhelpful, and doesn't actually reflect how people start their lives and then are impacted by ideas and experiences. People aren't evil, just like they're not good either. People do both good and bad things (according to a particular interpretation of good and bad), and people change. You could see this at play in the Christakis video - many of those students couldn't interpret Christakis' actions as anything but evil. If he forgot someone's name, he's obviously a jerk professor. If he smiled, it was a wicked, smug smile. If he stooped to talk to someone shorter, it was condescending. If he was quiet he was guilty, and if he spoke he was domineering. I think that essentialism combined with censorship is a great way to generate team loyalty. It's how I am with spectator sports. :) But it should stop there. In real life it creates a state of fear and conformity. It's like a throw-back to cave-man days. I don't necessarily think there's a solution to all of this. Total free speech may result in oppressive structures perpetuating. On the other hand, supporting every social justice cause at the cost of free speech may, like Haidt says, give opportunity for more oppression, especially through the process of groupthink and safetyism's resultant fragility. Neither ideology intends harm, but both effect it at times, and we have to accept that fact somehow and find a balance."
284,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"The road to hell was paved in good intentions, or so it seems. In this generation of protection and safetyism, according to co-authors Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff, we have created a generation of people who are no longer anti-fragile. As the concept of safety has crept into our emotional well-being a dangerous shift has taken place: intellectual freedom is no longer being protected. Through the well-intentioned efforts of helicopter parents, schools operating in a litigious society, and colleges responding to the tipped majority of fragile, depressed youth, we have not only stopped protecting intellectual freedom but we have stopped honoring our individual right to express ourselves and to seek truth through cognitive dissonance. Adding to this issue is our internet generation (iGen), where screens have replaced five key activities that were shown to curb depression: exercise, reading, spirituality, in-person interactions, and homework. In a study presented in the book, those five activities were inversely correlated to depression and they were shown to occur less in our iGen population. Growing up with the internet at their fingertips has reaped havoc on the wellbeing of the youth. So what can we do to stop this? We must fight against three Untruths as provided here:https://www.shortform.com/blog/coddli...Untruth #1: The Untruth of FragilityThe first untruth is that exposure to adversity or discomfort is inherently damaging. This is a falsehood—stressors and risks are necessary parts of human emotional development. And young people are no exception.Untruth #2: The Untruth of Emotional ReasoningThe second untruth is that you must always trust your emotions. Too often, emotional reasoning causes us to misperceive the world around us. For young people, emotional reasoning can cause them to feel intentional slights where there are none and strengthen the desire to shelter themselves from emotionally triggering experiences—even speech that they merely disagree with.Untruth #3: The Untruth of Us Versus ThemThe third untruth is that the world is defined by a black-and-white struggle between the forces of good and evil. Psychological research shows that the human mind is hardwired to sympathize with members of our in-group and fear and distrust members of an out-group.(from: https://www.shortform.com/blog/coddli...)Fighting against these untruths is our way to repair the damage and to set up a world that creates new generations of success and not failure.

285,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5819312-sheryl-sorrentino,Rating 5 out of 5," The Coddling of the American Mind offers a crucial summation of ""where we are"" as a nation. The book tears down the ""Three Great Untruths"" that have overtaken our public discourse: (1) “What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker,” (2) “Always trust your feelings,” and (3) “Life is a battle between good people and evil people.” The authors explain how these ""untruths"" are the polar opposite of the conventional wisdom needed to fairly evaluate opposing points of view with logic, critical thinking, empathy and open-mindedness, and are in fact based on various cognitive distortions.  The Coddling of the American Mind also discusses how tribalism is driving a wedge between various identity groups in this country. The authors do not downplay the realities of hate speech and verbal intimidation, but hail the virtues of the ""sticks and stones"" philosophy, where true strength and resiliency come not from ""safe spaces"" where people can shield themselves from speech they find distasteful, but by feeling ""safe"" in their own skin despite whatever someone else might be saying. Particular emphasis is given to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which the authors maintain can ""correct"" the cognitive distortions that cause ""emotional triggers."" There is even a short guide at the end of the book that explains how to practice this therapeutic technique. Particular emphasis is given to the chilling of free speech on college campuses—the result of college students' emotional fragility and its resultant ""otherizing"" opposing points of view and the people who hold them. The authors make a strong case that the various developmental disadvantages suffered by the current generation of college kids (""iGen"") was caused by excessive early childhood ""screen time,"" overprotective parenting and the elimination of free, unsupervised play (with all of its attendant risks). As the parent of a college sophomore, this book spoke to me; I may have, indeed, been guilty of overprotective parenting.In spite of the polarization we are experiencing in this country—along with the threats of climate change and social injustice—this book ends on a positive note offering an optimistic perspective for the future. I would recommend  The Coddling of the American Mind to iGen kids and their parents, as well as anyone else concerned about the devolution of discourse plaguing our nation during these troubled times.

It seemed dated and the entire premise was based on a few sensational anecdotes that everyone agrees are weird and unjustified, but then generalizes it for all students and seemingly, society. Without any backup data (at least not in the audio version)! And his solutions were nothing noteworthy and didn't even seem directly tied to what the problem was. Or, rather, any solution could be thrown in because it was so broad sweeping. And yet, so narrow too, dealing with college students, and only during a small time frame. And so much professor woe here (shout out to all my professorial friends!); and nothing seemed to be uniquely contributed by the author: no new research or experience or take, just a bunch of ideas (without accompanying data) he seemingly threw together to meet the page limit, that didn't seem connected or very insightful. His throwing in cognitive behavioral therapy ideas, bringing up depression and anxiety throughout because the co-author had depression seemed out of place. So much repetition as well....here's the six things in this chapter.....now here are the six things I just talked about in this chapter......couldn't get through this book fast enough. Fine points on the final pages: yes, learn CBT (or I also think everyone should actually go to therapy); yes, do meditation to learn mindfulness; yes, kids should go on missions/humanitarian service, serve in the military, or get a job before going to college (although, those in the work force appreciate kids starting work after they've had an education:)); yes, let your kids go outside and play; yes, read Adam Grant's book ""Think Again"" if you want real ideas about talking to people with ideas that differ from yours (oh wait, he didn't suggest this but should have :)).......reading this was so laborious. Maybe in 2018 when he wrote it (I guess) this was novel and cutting edge if you're being extremely generous? But it's not 2018, so......."
287,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65078147-dani-lle-van-den-brink,Rating 4 out of 5,"""Prepare the child for the road, not the road for the child.""Lukianoff and Haidt provide valuable insight on where good intentions have brought us and what they are doing to the next generation. Parents are overly protective of their children and these protected children show their vulnerabilities when they go to universities, complaining about how they are offended by opposition or even opposition to their views. Lukianoff and Haidt argue that physical safety is essential but students should not be protected from people who challenge their views. If anything, it makes them better at developing their stance on things and at responding to criticism. The more impactful danger that looms behind this is that freedom of speech suffers. If there is anywhere that ideas should be openly discussed, it is at a university. If this is no longer possible, the polarization that is already happening will only accelerate. The two writers also provide very basic advice to parents who are raising young children by saying that it is important to let them discover things themselves and not resort to the helicopter-parent mode. It is good for them to look after themselves every now and then and build up responsibility that they will need down the line. It is exactly this lack of independence that shows later in life and makes them weaker, not stronger. The book ends with a few useful practical advices about how we need to risk getting ""hurt"" or offended in order to grow, at an individual but also at a social level. The message of this book feels very important to me, especially because there is so much going on around us and there is so much out there. It is vital to the survival of a democracy that we remain open to people who do not agree with us. We should think about raising responsible children instead of overprotecting them and sending them out into the world too vulnerable to assert themselves. "
288,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78266388-jv-rajendran,Rating 5 out of 5,"Most, if not all, teachers (and professors) choose their careers to serve the students, thereby serving the community at large. Over the last few years, thanks but no thanks to the media, the teaching profession has been highly politicized. The book has touched on many personal points: one of the main reasons I greatly admire a university education is the free exchange of ideas and thoughts so that people, despite their different opinions, can seek the greater truth and understand each other. However, increasingly, this key feature of universities has been threatened. The book nicely summarizes the various issues faced by students, teachers, and the rest of the education community under three “Great Untruths”: (i) what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker, (ii) trust your feelings, and (iii) it is either us or them. Of course, they are untruths for a reason.Each Great Untruth is inculcated into the mentality of a student, especially in their formative years of childhood, adolescence, and teenage years---unfortunately, setting them up for continuous failure throughout life while leading such a life with stress and anxiety; the book terms people with such life as “anti-fragile.” What’s worse is that students are increasingly deprived of the right tools to overcome those problems; whatever the “tools” provided by the schools and universities, in many cases, make them worse.This book analyzes the root causes of these problems and blames them on how parents raise their kids, social media impacts kids, and the political forces on both sides of the aisle. A common theme across these different pillars of problems is “safetyism,” where children are not given a chance to fail and learn (oh, that’s how humans used to learn, and so do artificial intelligence-powered agents, which outperform humans). Such “safety culture” creates a prison for kids to lead a safe life while preventing the liberty to make mistakes and build a fraternity of people who may even disagree with her opinion—a stark opposite to the “us vs them” mentality that we increasingly in many universities and in the society-at-large. How do we expect the kids to think outside the box if they are not allowed to think? How do we expect them to perform in the world of differences if we don’t teach them in schools how to discuss and argue with people who hold different opinions? The book is a must-read for educators, parents, and anyone else trying to unify the community, country, or world."
289,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"Hmmm so this book is about trying to explain why college students, who used to be defenders of free speech on campus, now are more likely to demand that certain speakers not speak on campus and see speech itself as ""unsafe"". The authors identified 3 cognitive distortions they think are common on campus: 1) What doesn't kill you makes you weaker, 2) Always trust your feelings, and 3) Life is a battle between good people and evil people. Parts of the book seemed a little patronizing (but maybe I'm offended because I'm from the generation that the authors are calling out), particularly when the authors seemed to be insinuating that if all college students used CBT, then their cognitive distortions of the world being an unsafe place would go away. I think in doing this they were sometimes dismissive of situations that are genuinely unsafe (especially considering what just happened at Waterloo). That being said, I think the authors did a pretty good job of differentiating what kind of speech is unsafe (e.g. threats of physical violence) vs speech that one may disagree with but doesn't make you physically unsafe. Reasons the authors gave for for these shifts on campus included increasing polarization, increasing anxiety and depression, paranoid parenting, and less free play in childhood. The chapter on how declining free play in childhood could be linked to campus trends was probably the chapter I found most interesting. Basically, they argued that unsupervised free play in childhood is important in developing abilities to assess risk and resolve conflicts. Since childhood now is comprising more of homework/test prep, organized sports and clubs, children are becoming less tolerant of risk, more prone to anxiety, less adept at conflict resolution (as they become more used to having adults resolve conflict for them). Anyways, if I become a parent some day, hopefully I'll remember this."
290,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4216928-ty-turley-trejo,Rating 5 out of 5,"Absolute must-read. The authors articulate such an important explanation of the modern epidemic of anti-resilience in the rising generation.Their careful approach and timely warning about how to ensure we don’t set up the next generation for failure is compelling. (Apparently I’m a huge Jonathan Haidt fan since I also loved his book The Righteous Mind and I love the free speech organization he founded called FIRE.)The authors propose that students are being babied and coddled to encourage fragility that is neither productive nor helpful in engaging in a diverse society. There should be no such thing as a “safe space” on a college campus, intellectually. The authors praise the University of Chicago free speech statement which has proved to be a model for many universities. The authors make the argument that kids’ minds should not be fragile or resilient. They should be anti fragile. Much like muscles and bones. Muscles and bones respond to pressure, stress, and stretching in productive ways that strengthen itself. Without opposition, the muscles atrophy and the bones crumble. Wind extinguishes a candle but fuels a fire. Be a fire. I completely agree. They warn of “concept creep” when safety turns into emotional safety that should be equally protected with as much vigilance as physical safety. Or when words are equated with violence. This concept creep is happening again today (in 2023) with people saying we need to remove “violent rhetoric” in our language like “dodged a bullet” or “pull the trigger” or the like. “Scholars” are saying that this violent language is leading to actual violence instead of it just serving as a hollow, relatable speech metaphor to get a point across They also highlight the benefits of understanding cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and applying it to kids’ development. I learned that Herbert Marcuse (1960s German philosopher) is the father of the new left and the power structures prism. Based on his 1965 “Repressive tolerance” essay. The idea of intersectionality of the progressive left turns up tribalism which can be dangerous. And micro aggressions + identity politics leads to cancel culture and unhelpful virtue signaling. One possible summary of the book is the outlining of the three great untruths: 1) what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker 2) always trust your feelings and 3) the world can be divided between good and evil people. The authors ascribe much of the current collegiate coddled minds to coddling, overprotective parents. I tend to agree. They hovered and protected, rarely allowing kids to take important risks to grow and develop and solved all of their problems while under their care so that when they left the nest, they couldn’t solve their own problems and would turn to college administrators for help and intervention. This is a book I could (and probably should) re-read from time to time. Especially as my kids grow up. There’s a terrific section at the end of the book that outlines practical solutions for raising wise kids, maintaining wise universities, and ultimately creating a wise society. Including a lot of helpful resources. The authors espouse free range parenting, of which I wholeheartedly agree. Kids need space to roam, make mistakes, learn by experience, and problem solve and interact with their peers at varying levels of complexity. Of course, striking the right balance of protecting kids - which is a primary responsibility for adults - while allowing them room to grow is the million dollar question. But this book highlights the danger of focusing too much on the former and not enough on the latter. For instance, the crime rate today is no worse than in 1963 when kids were allowed to roam much more freely. Also, the fear of kidnapping is unsubstantiated and overblown. The book points to figures stating that the rate of child abductions by strangers has been unchanged over past decade and a half and fewer end in homicide. 90% of kids reported missing miscommunicated plans, misunderstood directions, or ran away. 99.8% of the time, they returned home. The vast majority of abductions are by biological parents who don’t have custody. Stranger abductions make up a fraction of 1% of missing children (roughly 100 kids a year in a country of 70 million minors). And of the missing kids abducted by a stranger in 2011, 4 out of 5 did not live in a home with two parents. 1/3 of the children abducted were never reported missing. In other words, they were kids who fell through the cracks. Kids today are much safer than we were growing up. Which is not what you would think if you watch the media or the news. With the combination of the crime waves in the 1960s with round the clock cable news in the 1980s (and now omnipresent social media news), it’s obvious why parents have grown fearful. This is the “availability heuristic,” which I learned about in another parenting book . The more we hear about certain phenomenon, the more we believe it will happen, even if the statistical (im)probability has not changed. So, Is it any surprise if parents do not allow unsupervised play and then repeatedly tell their children how dangerous the world is, that they then grow up believing that can’t operate in the world because they feel unsafe?The problem for those of us who want to practice wise parenting is that there is always an obsessive, paranoid parent just around the corner who “fetishizes” safety and reports children engaging in unsupervised play as child abuse. This is not theoretical. The book provides numerous examples of this happening all over the country. So parents who don’t want to be overprotective are dissuaded from doing so in some instances out of fear of getting CPS called on them. What a world. This book is also where I first learned of the Heterodox academy, which is an amazing organization committed to fostering heterodoxy in our institutions of learning. Intellectual diversity is so badly needed right now (for example, just 7% of journalists are Republicans). Even more so than racial diversity, in my opinion. Since racial diversity is not a good proxy for actual diversity. The book also highlights the “problems of progress.” Abundance of food leads to obesity. Hyper/over connection leads to mental health issues. And coddling and overfocusing on kids Leads to fragility of a generation. Those would not be issues in a world that is struggling to survive and trying to find food and sustenance and shelter.Finally, one of my favorite lines is that the authors anticipate criticism of their book pointing out their gender (male) and race (white) as undermining their arguments because they are racists or sexists motivated primarily by preserving their privilege. Their response will be (in the spirit of Mark Lilla): “That is a slur, not an argument. Mane and argument and I’ll respond to it.” Huzzah!"
291,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78930201-jill-wahlen,Rating 3 out of 5,"I liked it and I didn’t? I feel like it made many valid points about the younger generations and how we can avoid exacerbating problems and issues. The latter half of the book I feel like covered this really well and resonated with me. I also felt grateful for many things my parents did that were unpopular (I’m the last age in the Millennial category, but see a lot of crossover in terms of issues). Where I struggled was I feel like it was (1) a lot of ranting about the most extreme scenarios that happen in universities and media (I skipped a few chapters in the middle bc didn’t feel like it was a productive analysis tbh) and (2) it also was still coming from a white man on topics like gender, sexuality, race, social justice. Sooo… while maybe the current methods aren’t the best/right ways of going about things, the author has zero experience in these fields, so drawing attention to them from a place of privilege could widen the gap and make it harder for marginalized groups to gain any ground in terms of equity. Sure, Title IX might make it hard for men’s crew teams to get funding/interest and there might not be as many athletes for women’s crew teams, but how much of that is culturally engrained in young girls who are pushed to be ballerinas and gymnasts? I don’t feel like the author gave much recognition to the pre-existing social systems/gendered expectations that these (definitely imperfect) programs, like Title IX, are attempting to improve. I would apply the same arguments to mental disorders — while rates are certainly on the rise due to the internet, does the pervasive nature of the internet simply call attention to a preexisting and silent challenge? (I say this as a person with a long family history of severe psychological disorders on both sides of my family and think it’s a mix of the two). While I can bitch and moan about the contents of this book, it obviously made me think a lot, so I think it did it’s job. "
292,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52011393-colin-baumgartner,Rating 4 out of 5,"I discovered Mr. Haidt through his brilliant Ted Talk about political orientation and moral reasoning. From there, I found a video recording of a talk he gave at The Pennsylvania State University about the idea that the unique combination of safetyism and social media is radically reshaping the environment of universities and society. This book follows that talk more or less exactly.Working in education, I notice many of the trends Lukianoff and Haidt mention in the book. Things that stand out in particular relief are concept creep, severe anxiety about everyday stressors, and a number of the ‘Great Untruths’ mentioned by the authors.I think this book has a lot to offer anyone involved in academia, anyone who works in education, and anyone who has a kid really. The book sorts through big trends and offers some interesting insight into the psychology and the causes of these oftentimes harmful shifts.What I am more hesitant about is the book itself. I could have done with a bit less repetition. I get that this was built on the article originally published in The Atlantic, and perhaps there was some pressure to really bolster the article with additional information, but many introductory sections in chapters felt redundant. I also felt somewhat wary of the examples used in a number of sections. Certainly there are many, many examples of emotional, somewhat ignorant actions on the part of undergraduates (who probably have good intentions in their hearts but act in terribly misguided and childish ways); the authors point to these moments too often. This is low-hanging fruit and I would have liked to see some more nuanced examples perhaps...Overall, a great analysis of trends and some good practical advice regarding how to counteract some of the more harmful aspects of modern education."
293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8745469-peter-kazmaier,Rating 3 out of 5,"To my thinking, THE CODDLING OF THE AMERICAN MIND is really two books which I would rate very differently and as such the average overall rating (three stars) is misleading. The first three chapters are excellent and I would rate that portion of the book as four or five stars. They delineate the root causes behind many of the disturbing trends one sees in the thinking and conduct of undergraduates today and analyzes these causes in terms of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). They distill their observations and recommendations into three lies and about nine pit falls in thinking CBT attempts to counteract. I found these ideas very helpful and continue to use them to analyze my own thinking. I will read these chapters over and over again.I am much less sanguine about the second part of the book which provides anecdotes, supposedly in support of the early chapters. Reiterating the events at Evergreen State College was useful, but for most of the anecdotes and discussion, I found that the authors broke their own rules. They used labeling extensively without clearly defining their labels. Many of the labels were highly pejorative, yet as far as I could see the authors did not explain why the labels were appropriate. They seemed to engage in mind reading (another of the pitfalls) in that they seemed confident they knew what motivated the various non-university groups which they also seemed to blame for the anxiety-ridden undergraduate mindset.When I finished and thought about what I had read, it seemed to me the authors were aiming for an “equality of blame” in their analysis of the anecdotes. This made no sense to me. The university administrations establish codes of conduct, enforce them, hire faculty, permit or exclude external speakers, and ultimately decide if they will support or not support teachers and students that are under attack for their views. Similarly the reading lists, course work, examinations, and grading are carried out by the faculty. Furthermore professors, by their own conduct and the way they approach questions provide examples to the students on how one should behave as one purses truth in an unbiased and objective manner. It seems ludicrous to me to argue that outside forces or groups who have trouble even getting an invited speaker onto campus can share equal culpability for how students are turning out.In summary, the early chapter are excellent and deserve a rating of four or five stars. The rest of the book, to my mind deserves only one or two stars. The average or overall rating, is perhaps, 2.5 to 3 stars."
294,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102059408-brian-hilliker,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book spoke to me. Sometimes subtly, other times explosively. In many ways my childhood was analyzed and dissected throughout this book. The authors showcased how much of the iGen experience is filled with modes of ""safetyism."" These modes of safetyism stifle the ability for older members of this generation to handle conflict, understand their emotions, and respond to opposing viewpoints effectively. At first, I believed myself to be immune from these generalizations about my generation. However, as I self-assessed my middle/high school/college behavior I realized how much work I needed to do. Many times I would invite debate/discussion about controversial issues; however, I would tend to downplay the other sides arguments or engage in logical fallacies to bolster my own position. My emotions/thoughts tended to drift towards sadness, anxiety, or deep seated worry about my future. This book addressed many of these internal struggles by explaining how society unconsciously tends to promote three untruths about life (trust your feelings, tough experiences produce weakness, and the world is divided between wholly good and wholly evil people). I have seen these untruths in my own life, and in my experiences with other people from all sides of the political spectrum. I have seen these untruths at the Heritage Foundation, Teach for America, middle schools, my college, and many churches! I enjoyed how the authors did not limit their analysis to explaining how these Untruths have pervaded society. Instead, they also provided practical recommendations for how society can change our institutions, children, and universities for the better. Great book outlining the importance of free speech, intellectual thought, and the effects of safetyism on children!"
295,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63473701-elisha-lawrence,Rating 5 out of 5,"I really enjoyed this book. Haidt and Lukianoff identify a possible root to modern culture's propensity toward cancel culture and partisan divides. In my mind, they established that a problem exists with emotional immaturity. Students are far more likely to be offended than in previous generations and they are more likely to view challenging ideas as offensive. This clutters a landscape like a college campus which is supposed to be about the free exchange of ideas. Universities should be the place where ideas are challenged and people grow intellectually. The authors share some of the bone-chilling stories of campus protests of controversial speakers turning extremely ugly and sometimes violent. There seems to be a mindset that if you disagree with me or challenge me, then you are the ENEMY!!!! This is not helpful at all. It leaves no room for healthy debate where you actually consider the merit of someone's ideas. Intellectual discourse is stifled by shouting voices claiming that speech can cause physical harm. While words can cause emotional distress, this idea applied wholesale to any type of speech breeds a self-destructive and ignorant society. Haidt and Lukianoff place part of the blame on the parents of this generation of college students being over-protective. This hypothesis seems to warrant consideration. Certainly, I am more fearful of dangers than previous generations of parents. We grew up with lots of freedom as kids that my own children do not possess. This book has inspired me to help my children develop a greater sense of adventure. I don't want to practice ""safetyism"" as the ultimate goal. Kids need to learn from making mistakes. If I never allow them to fail, struggle, or explore, then when will they develop those skills? And from personal experience working with college students, it does seem that over the last few years emotional and social maturity among students has declined significantly. There are certainly other factors at play, which I think the authors would acknowledge. But at the very least, this is a thought-provoking work that confronts cancel culture and we need more works that help us develop thicker skin so we can have a society where healthy debate and free exchange of ideas is lauded.

As I was reading this book and finding it quite interesting, I reached out to a few thoughtful and well-read friends to mention how I was enjoying it. Each said that they were avoiding it because they had a problem with the author Haidt. That got me a little worried about what I was overlooking and failing to consider. But the more I read, the more I liked the book, loving the way that the authors laid out their arguments and thinking that something important was being said. I finished the book very impressed. I'm not sure whether the authors' contentions are _correct_, but I respect their effort and am excited to have this topic further debated.After I read the book, to further investigate Haidt, I listened to about four hours of Haidt interviews from various sources (admittedly, mostly friendly audiences). He seems like a reasonable guy to me, sufficiently respectable to be able put forth an argument and have others review and respond to it. I read some book reviews, and the criticism felt jumbled to me. With The Guardian's review, for instance, there seems to be some legitimate criticism there, but it's too messy and fragmented for me to really grasp on to. My favorite piece of criticism that I've come across is the goodreads review by ""Mehrsa"" below. In the end, the criticism pushed me away from the 5.0 star rating that I was inclined to give, instead pushing me down to 4.5.I'm very curious what others think.

I finished my undergrad degree in May 2013, so right before all of this started to take off. All the stuff about Milo Yiannopoulus is so amusing to me. My book review for Dangerous is one of the top reviews on Goodreads but.....no one cares about Milo anymore and the 2015 Berkeley thing seems just embarrassing in 2020. If you're one of those speed reader types, there is an ""In Sum"" at the end of each chapter for what appears to be that purpose. If you have not read iGen, you should do so before reading this. I would almost call this work a response to iGen. With all that stuff being said, Zoomers/iGen are the only people who have ever vocally expressed concern about me being on my phone in a room full of people. ""Are you okay?"" ""Are you feeling left out?"" I was answering one measly text, but the presence of my phone affected them immediately and they were worried about my current mental state. Millennials, GenX, and Baby Boomers would never say this ever, to anyone.Side note on one of their suggestions: As a Children's Librarian & the Vice President of a local teen center for the past 5 years, I could tell you that forcing Zoomers to read iGen will probably not go over well. If you suggest that psychological problems stem from smart phones, their sole takeaway will be that you're a pearl clutching, crotchety 95 year old who was born in the nineteen hundreds.

The formatting, it reminded me more of an outline for an essay or scientific paper than an actual book. Which is totally fine, it was obviously a conscious choice, but I found the constant headers and “in sum” at the end of each chapter very distracting and it ruined the flow of reading for me at times. 2. It felt like two different books that never quite tied together. The first book being about coddling college age students/young adults and the second was about not letting children play outside enough. I get that they were all connected, but I needed to see a chapter merging that gap I guess.3. For as much as this book talked about the benefits of CBT, the only real “guide” on how to actually USE it were to refer you to other books and one extremely brief appendix. 4. The evidence. Some seemed more anecdotal than anything else, and some stories seemed to make the opposite point. For example: talking about how children would actually be very safe to walk a few blocks alone and then telling that awful awful awful story about the little boy in Florida?!?! I know it doesn’t sound like it, but I did really enjoy the themes of the book and found it really challenged my thinking at times. It’s one of the books you should definitely take with a grain of salt. I’ve found with books that are adapted from essays or blogposts, I often just prefer the essay and find faults with the full book. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. "
299,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"An astonishing book on the how and why of university outrage and, for me most importantly, the increase of identity politics. As a moderate leftist I became increasingly annoyed, after I noticed I started participating in it myself and tried correcting myself on it, with the call-out culture and moralististic condemning of everyone that does not hold your opinion or world view. I learned the hard way we must always listen to everyone's opinion, how hard or stupid it may sound to you. Having read the Righteous Mind and The Happiness Hypothesis the Coddling of the American Mind is a perfect example of the wisdoms of Haidts books put into practise. Although I truly loved the new perspective on our modern day political culture I agree with many critics that the book ressembles more an enlarged essay than a true book. I would've loved a deeper dive into more flushed out evidence and psychological processes. Of course, not everyone likes this so the writers had to make some justifiable compromises. However deep, or undeep, you may be entrenched into the politics or college life of today, I encourage everyone to read this book, just to make you see things from a new angle. Maybe even read All Minus One, an easy to start (and I believe free, online) book that features John Stuart Mills ideas and arguments on and for free speech. Together these books make a very strong argument for leaving the current culture of safetyism, call-out culture, uninviting speakers, public outrage and shaming ect. behind."

Si bien muchas de las cosas del libro sobre los códigos de conducta universitarios y los problemas que están enfrentando en USA no se pueden aplicar directamente en el contexto mexiano, el transfondo y el origen del problema puede ser visto y experimentado claramente en México. Gran número de jóvenes estamos experimentando altos niveles de estrés, ansiedad y depresión debido a la falta de educación en el manejo de nuestras emociones y el enfrentarnos a las ideas contrarias a nuestras creencias. Muchos cambios se están llevando a cabo en la sociedad y la búsqueda del respeto de derechos humanos, la concientización ecológica y otros temas están separando y partiendo el espectro social de la humanidad. Y este fenómeno es estudiado a profundidad en este libro. No sólo eso, el libro tiene varios consejos y soluciones a cómo ayudar a dejar de polarizar estos temas para evitar conflictos que salen de control en los diferentes ámbitos sociales. Considero que es una excelente lectura para TODOS los que nos dedicamos a la docencia a nivel universitario así como para profesores de preparatoria, ya que te da muy buenas estrategias para atacar temas polémicos o controversiales. También lo puedo recomendar ampliamente a cualquiera interesado en conocer un poco más del contexto piscológico y social de la generación Millenial y Zenial. "

I first heard about this book from a podcast featuring Jonathan Haidt, who I was quite impressed by. The ideas of this book resonated quite strongly with my experiences at Berkeley seeing the call out culture and safetyism which was all quite new to me. The authors did a good job of figuring out the three great untruths that are relevant to explaining the shift in college culture of late and more generally throughout society. This first part of the book is the most valuable, the rest of the book emphasizes various aspects like examples of unfortunate situations that arose from such misguided thinking, more detailed sociological factors and guides for parenting and schooling that can help us reverse such trends.A lot of it would be quite relevant for parents to read to understand how to be careful of such things while bringing up their child, but I found myself skimming through such parts. Nevertheless there were a lot of interesting things I learnt about the travesty of American kids not getting enough play and being burdened by homework and extracurriculars that gives them a better shot at getting into college. It definitely made me appreciate my childhood more and hope that such trends reverse in time. My basic complain with the book was that it was too long for my purpose, I almost got everything out of the podcast I had listened to."
302,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51266245-kat,Rating 3 out of 5,"Well this took me forever to finish. A lot in this book I agree with, and a lot I disagree with. I think the authors' academic disciplines occasionally blinded them to alternate justifications for what they're describing. I do mostly agree with the main thrust of their argument. We don't do anyone any favors by trying to shield them from all harm and engaging with view points you disagree with makes you a better person and scholar. Also it is pretty clear that rates of anxiety and depression are increasing. I actually have had a similar experience to Lukianoff in that I was diagnosed With Severe Chronic depression (in highschool), went through CBT, found it very helpful, and was able tomanage my depression through college without regular treatment. I completely agree that CBT Principles can be helpful for everyone and that you shouldn't always trust your feelings. My largest sticking point is I find the argument that this is a problem for all of Gen Z hard to square with the fact that the behavior they describe on college campuses seems to almost exclusively happen in Ivy League schools orin libral arts schools in the Northeast or west coast. I'm an older momber of Gen z (born in the 90s) and went to college in the Midwest. I observed some of what is described in this book, but not much. And I experienced plenty of debate. I took a Philiosophy class where we spent two weeks debating abortion. Two weeks! I'll sum up by saying I saw a lot of truth in this but I also saw some overreactions."

I’d been putting it off because it just sounded a bit grumpy and heavy. It didn’t help that before I started it I read an excellent top Goodreads review by a woman named Mehrsa who confirmed a lot of my fears about the narrow perspective of this book. I still like that review and think she has some really great points. But honestly, I ended up really enjoying this book. I found a lot of the ideas refreshing and it really gave me a lot to think about. It felt like I took a mini solo university course guided by a well-written textbook. I appreciated Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt’s perspective on parenting (even though I am not a parent) and the links they made between overprotected kids and the rising intolerance on college campuses. Yes, I think there were flaws and I would love to have an animated discussion on the whole thing. I also really enjoyed the way this book is framed through CBT and appreciated the final notes on it. They included a list of categories on distorted automatic thoughts and I have had many! It was a nice reflective process to go through them and look at ways to mindfully reframe my thinking. I would say my brother and I have pretty different views which made me wary of this book. But being more open to different perspectives ended up being kind of the whole point of this thing. It was truly a great gift."

Lukianoff and Haidt, bravo!The authors weave together compelling threads from disparate fields and from their own experience, both personal and professional, to support their thesis that American students today are being ruined by the application to their lives of three Great Untruths:1. What doesn't kill you makes you weaker.2. Always trust your feelings.3. The world is divided between good and bad people.They then offer reasonable, practical methods of weakening or eliminating these three lies.I was drawn to this book because I've become somewhat pessimistic, even cynical, about the future of Western culture. Refreshingly, the authors emphasize that they feel the current situation is remediable and that no one is powerless before it.I recommend this book to anyone who is in school, running a school, or, for that matter, worried about the polarizing trends in modern Western thought."

Looking at this book as a self contained argument as to why free speech and exchange of ideas has diminished on college campuses, I really liked it. The first three parts are excellent. One author is an attorney, and you can tell. He lays out three untruths that have pervaded college campuses, provides evidence for them (mostly anecdotal, but compelling and beautifully argued), and then hypothesizes how the current generation (college students from 2013 onward) were inculcated with these misguided values through overprotective parenting and the extremely competitive college admissions landscape.However, my feeling at the end of the book is that it was about the canary in the coal mine. The focus on the upper middle class may have been merited, but the events of 2020 (election, pandemic, etc.) revealed how these untruths are a lot more pervasive that perhaps they initially appeared to be. The bifurcation of safety and freedom was magnified in so many ways . . .suggesting to me that this book merely addressed the tip of the iceberg. "
306,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"""The Coddling of the American Mind"" focuses on a culture of ""intellectual safety"" on American college campuses and its impact on free speech and public discourse. The authors argue that overprotection and the suppression of uncomfortable ideas hinder intellectual growth and resilience among young adults and society at large. They identify three ""Great Untruths"" contributing to this phenomenon: the idea that what doesn't kill you makes you weaker, that feelings are always correct, and that life is a battle between good people and bad people. They provide a rigorous analysis of what got us here (for example, overprotective parenting, limited free play and political polarization) and suggest fostering resilience, embracing discomfort, and promoting open dialogue instead.I really enjoyed the book! It's easy to read and well-reasoned. I appreciated how the authors emphasized the importance of nurturing resilience and engaging with discomfort, rather than avoiding it, to foster mental fortitude among students. It also made me think more deeply about how good intentions can go arwy when it comes to protecting minorities."

It has me so concerned for our future, and we're seeing so much of what was discussed in this book happening around us today. I'm still processing some of it because I very much believe in the idea of ""when you know better, you do better."" How much do we know better and that's why we do the things we do. I do think we've made life for our kids too easy. The road has been prepared for them and they have not been prepared for the road. I found it very interesting that they discussed how kids are growing up slower--not faster--like we so often hear. This may be some of the issues I've seen in schools. The book says students who are 15 are acting like 12 and when they go to college at 18, they are more like what a 15 year old would be. This explains so much of the need for a ""safe place"" to go on campus when someone has an idea that offends you. I love the discussion of a ""call out"" culture in this book, and I see that every day around me. This is something that permeates the world--when someone has a difference of opinion, then we must call them out, and almost shame them. "
308,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is a rather ingenious idea, that iGen is behaving so oddly on campus due to cognitive distortions caused by over parenting and poor education. They don't nail the hypothesis exactly, but they do enough damage to make this book necessary reading. As someone who always looked at university as a four-year paid vacation, I felt like these authors schooled my uneducated self on what university is supposed to be like and why it's important. There was a great deal of discussion on how proper education can teach you how to think critically, and why differing opinions are so important to that. While the two authors do seem to be classic liberals, they do also become very critical of where higher education has gone. Yet, they do a good job of explaining why that has taken place. I found their explanation to be fair and wholly bipartisan. When they start diving into studies of what happens to mammals without socializing play...man, it gets trippy. The cognitive distortions caused by new technology and different attitudes...it gets you worried for these kids. Highly recommended. "

 I thought this book was pretty good, especially taking in the fact that he was bashing on my own generation haha, but doesn't everyone? HAHA Anyways, I agreed with a lot and honestly, probably most of the points that come up in this book. I thought that the whole peanut allergy thing at the beginning was very interesting. I think I was really into this book because I was in psychology last semester so I felt studious while reading this book.

I listened on audio and though I saw firsthand this intellectual marginalization in college, I was nonetheless shocked by the marginalization of debate and discussion in favor of “safe” environments. But mostly I was caught by their discussions throughout of the ways we can all fall into habits borne out of never wanting to see our kids hurt or be at risk - but the effect of that means ultimately sacrificing our children learning independence and ability to choose a good life (in both the Biblical & Platonic sense).If I see you in the next few months, beware I'll probably bring this book up and not stop talking."

Very helpful to understand the terms, definitions, sources of authority, understanding and actions of a segment of IGen that gets a lot of airtime on national news. A solid description of what is going on and why.As a Christian, I found the authors prescriptions for change lacking in a substantive foundation (confirmation bias, I know what you are thinking). We need to ground our understanding of humanity in something larger than ourselves (as image-bearers of God intrinsically worthy of respect and care). Because this is how I think and want others to treat me is not sufficient grounds. I really appreciate the authors desire to break the destructive cycles we are presently caught (and they in fact offer some very good ideas) but we now need a Truth that transcends human experience and reality and that lays claims on us all to live righteously and with integrity. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom."

As observers of the US, we might be enamored sometimes with life there and it's good to look at it from another perspective. The book talks about how harmful it is to children when we protect them from all dangers and don't allow them to experience anything risky until they reach adulthood.I don't necessarily agree with everything the authors have said. Aside from the anecdotal evidence or how they dismiss non-physical dangers, they make some solid points. The book also flows smoothly from talking about the problems, to how it came to be, and finally what to do it against it.Actual page count: 269"

Section I and II: Why are the most liberal students at the most liberal universities so sensitive and offended? Let's take a broad brush to a nuanced topic and use the most extreme examples to clutch our pearls at how spoiled our young people are.Section III: turns out those liberal students were under actual death threats from the far right. Who knew? (Well, the authors knew, but didn't tell you until now). Add in a healthy dose of ""kids these days"" and ""parents these days"" and ""back in my day"" and hand wringing about various social ills and offer no new thought on how to help except a ridiculous theme about the Great Untruths (untruths that bear a striking resemblance to evangelical and Christian Nationalist culture by the way--a concerning factor that should have been explored) and there's the book.Section 4: some groundbreaking (/s) parenting and educational ideas such as: limit screen time, support more free play, more recess, foster critical thinking, etc. Middle class parents ALREADY know this stuff.

I am on the opposite side of the political spectrum as the authors, but I feel they did an excellent job of presenting the topic fairly and not politicizing it, in fact giving examples of wrongs committed on both sides. It is crazy to think that parenting styles so profoundly influenced university happenings and practices, and the change was so abrupt. I hope this work has had the intended affect on such in the 5 years since it was published. On a personal note: as a parent of iGen daughters, it was helpful to learn about the characteristics of their generation. It also really made me consider areas of my own life where I’ve believed the Great Untruths, and I appreciated the appendix on CBT as I totally recognize some of the thought distortions I’ve been guilty of buying into.

It is much like The Righteous Mind in its dedication to being fair minded, but lacks the same detail and thoroughness (he has spent much less time studying this topic). He and his co-author lay out a context driven analysis of what they perceive to be a rise in intolerance for free speech on college campuses in the U.S. That analysis also seeks to explain the rising rates of depression, anxiety and suicide in members of igen. This intersection between emotional reasoning and polarization was the most interesting aspect of the book. The authors clearly and succinctly present the evidence supporting their claims and acknowledge where it us lacking. At times their claims were overly broad given the evidence presented. The book would have also benefited from a recounting of the historical trends on campuses that led to an increase in identity politics. Many are decrying this reality without understanding it is a direct product of racism and exclusion. "

All of which I learned stem from generational changes, access to technology, and increasing polarization.

I hope that you will suffer betrayal because that will teach you the importance of loyalty. Sorry to say, but I hope you will be lonely from time to time so that you don’t take friends for granted. I wish you bad luck, again, from time to time so that you will be conscious of the role of chance in life and understand that your success is not completely deserved and that the failure of others is not completely deserved either. And when you lose, as you will from time to time, I hope every now and then, your opponent will gloat over your failure. It is a way for you to understand the importance of sportsmanship. I hope you’ll be ignored so you know the importance of listening to others, and I hope you will have just enough pain to learn compassion. Whether I wish these things or not, they’re going to happen. And whether you benefit from them or not will depend upon your ability to see the message in your misfortunes.”"

The authors use, continually, the word ""untruth"" instead of ""lie"". They refer to ""Wisdom and its opposite"" rather than ""wisdom and folly."" The hesitance to bluntly make the argument they imply seems to undermine the argument a bit, especially since it's an argument for free speech, and the words they choose feel a little Orwellian. (If they chose ""untruth"" to contrast with the ""truth"" of Aristotle's telos, then it's more understandable, but even still, it feels weaker). That aside, the book directly takes on a cultural battle in higher education, and I believe it offers some effective practical tips near the end of the book, and it is rather philosophically sound, though suffering from a fear of establishing objective truth, especially in a political or religious context."

A lot of commmentators tend to blame ideology - not their ideology, of course, the other side's. Lukianoff and Haidt take it back to thought patterns originating in childrearing and education. Specifically, three bad ideas that have taken root in recent years ""What doesn't kill you makes you weaker"", ""Trust your feelings"" and ""Life is a battle between good people and evil people"". With these patterns imprinted in people's minds, we have a recipe for polarisation and public shaming and mental illness.It's useful to look at it from this end of the telecope, I think, because it allows you to focus on the workings of your own thinking and break bad habits. Without that, I think it's too easy to look out at the world and think it's only other people's brains that are broken. No, it's yours too. It's everybody, really, to some extent, even if some people have it worse than others."
