Thank you to everyone who commented about this review and about him, but it seemed wrong to not let you know. It's always hard to lose someone who has been such a huge part of your life from day one, but please know that he died a happy old man, peacefully, surrounded by his family. And isn't that the best any of us can ever hope for?~ Emily ♥ .......................................................................I'm going to share something with you.My grandad is the very definition of curmudgeonly. He's an eighty year old man who likes to complain about anything and everything: youth today, UK politics, my dad, the weather, technology... you name it. He calls me and my siblings up most days to tell stories punctuated with rants and numerous ""bloody hell""s. I'm not worried about him seeing this post because he doesn't trust computers and hasn't even grasped the concept of the internet. Most new technology is referred to as ""those bloody things"", except for FaceTime, which he has recently taken a liking to. He makes use of it by popping up on my iPhone multiple times a day to deliver a bout of doom and gloom in which I see nothing on the screen but his chin. All my friends are a little afraid of him and are never quite sure when he's joking. He is nothing short of a grumpy old man. Except, in truth, that's only half of it.The other day I opened the mailbox to find an envelope which contained this picture of me and him from my graduation:And with it came this note:Thing is, behind whatever my grandad may seem on the outside, he is a loving man who lost his wife - my grandmother - several years ago. He bugs us constantly with his moaning about life because he's lonely and because he misses us. He has a heart and he has a sense of humour, even if most people don't really get it. And it was in Ove, the protagonist of this novel, that I recognized pieces of my grandad.

“People said he was bitter. Maybe they were right. He’d never reflected much on it. People also called him antisocial. Ove assumed this meant he wasn’t overly keen on people. And in this instance he could totally agree with them. More often than not people were out of their minds.”

I loved Ove. Parts of this novel punched me right in my emotions. I think I would have been okay if this novel was merely a sad, moving tale about a man who has to get on with his life after his wife died. I could have shaken off the emotional manipulation - as I did with The Fault in Our Stars - and not shed a tear. But this story is so much more than a tearjerker.Ove shouldn't be a character we love; he's so miserly and grumpy and skeptical of everything... but he's also hilarious. He charms us with his completely uncharming ways. Because, though I don't share his worldview, what he says actually makes sense and sometimes it's really funny. Take this:
“Ove glares out of the window. The poser is jogging. Not that Ove is provoked by jogging. Not at all. Ove couldn’t give a damn about people jogging. What he can’t understand is why they have to make such a big thing of it. With those smug smiles on their faces, as if they were out there curing pulmonary emphysema. Either they walk fast or they run slowly, that’s what joggers do. It’s a forty-year-old man’s way of telling the world that he can’t do anything right. Is it really necessary to dress up as a fourteen-year-old Romanian gymnast in order to be able to do it? Or the Olympic tobogganing team? Just because one shuffles aimlessly around the block for three quarters of an hour?”
Plus, there's a wonderful cat who our lovable protagonist grudgingly befriends, which just improves this book even more. I think perhaps the saddest part of this book is not found in the most obvious place. Ove's loss of his wife touched me, but I was even more affected by the underlying tale of old age and how many old people can be left feeling lonely and out of place towards the end of their lives. How difficult it must be to live alone in a world that becomes more foreign to you every day, with its new gadgets and trends that you don't understand or care to entertain. It was moving and thought-provoking.I'm going to call my grandad now.Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13400128-lynda,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the greatest motivations for living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we live harder, more obstinately, with more fury. Some need its constant presence to even be aware of its antithesis. Others become so preoccupied with it that they go into the waiting room long before it has announced its arrival. We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves.""― Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove""For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.""― Fredrik Backman, A Man Called OveI'm sitting here this afternoon, alone. Alone and contemplating. Contemplating life. Contemplating time. Contemplating age. Just contemplating...I do so with tear streaked cheeks. I've just finished crying. I've just parted with a man I've never met, yet a man I feel I know so well. A man I disliked in the beginning, yet a man I loved at the end. A man who spent his life contemplating. A Man Called Ove. Ove (pronounced 'Oo-veh') is a cantankerous, taciturn, inflexible man. He's a veritable stick in the mudslide of human advancement, futilely rebelling against it. He thinks himself surrounded by idiots, with people always disappointing him. Over the years he has been conned, ripped off and harrassed, mainly by bureaucrats (""the men in the white shirts""), whom he despises. He is a man who lives life fairly and squarely but finds himself beset by injustice and bad luck. Ove has certainly had his fair share of sadness. At 59, he's lost his job as well as the love of his life, his wife Sonja. He misses Sonja so much that sometimes he can't bear existing in his own body. 
""Loving someone is like moving into a house. At first you fall in love with all the new things, amazed every morning that all this belongs to you, as if fearing that someone would suddenly come rushing in through the door to explain that a terrible mistake had been made, you weren't actually supposed to live in a wonderful place like this. Then over the years the walls become weathered, the wood splinters here and there, and you start to love that house not so much because of all its perfections, but rather for its imperpections. You get to know all the nooks and crannies. How to avoid getting the key caught in the lock when it's cold outside. Which of the floorboards flex slightly when one steps on them or exactly how to open the wardrobe doors without them creaking. These are the little secrets that make it your home.""
“People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had.” ― Fredrik Backman, A Man Called OveLife has got to the point where Ove's had enough. He is fed up. So fed up that he simply wants to end it all. He wants out of this world.A Man Called Ove essentially calls out the dangers of living in a society that focuses more on thought than action, and highlights the risk of imprisoning oneself in grief. There is a sombreness to this novel (afterall, it's from Sweden! :-) ), but there is also optimism and lots of laugh out loud humor. 
“Ove glares out of the window. The poser is jogging. Not that Ove is provoked by jogging. Not at all. Ove couldn’t give a damn about people jogging.

Just because one shuffles aimlessly around the block for three quarters of an hour?”
I simply adored this book. Backman's writing is clean and simple, at times deceptively so, with its gentle, episodic and occasionally repetitive structure. The story is laced with loneliness, with life's numerous disappointments and the great grey weight of the real; the last chapters deliver some unexpectedly savage emotional blows. But this is tempered with a sense of quiet celebration.A note of hope threads through the writing, building slowly, and the small details as much as the grand narrative delight and move: the moments of connection, the reawakening of a man frozen by grief, the ability of people to touch one another's lives.This is a MUST READ. It will resonate with everyone."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie,Rating 2 out of 5,"Argh! It’s hard not to start this review with a bunch of expletives, because this book pissed me off royally! Shit! See, I can’t even hold it in. The cat and the fat were the straws that broke the camel’s back. Let’s start with Ove not liking the cat. Not liking the cat is one thing. For some reason bitching about a cat is supposed to be funny, but to me it’s annoying. Ove kicking the cat a couple of times cranked my wincing up a notch. But there was a way worse cat crime: Ove was going to leave the cat to die in a snow bank! The neighbor saw the cat and saved it, while Ove looked on with annoyance. So Ove isn’t just grumpy, he’s heartless--seriously mean. And then miraculously, yet still predictably, Ove comes to like the cat and suddenly they’re best friends. At least the story’s predictability saved me from fretting incessantly about the cat.Cat problem number 2: The author, Backman, is completely absolutely totally clueless when it comes to cats. Cats are known for not being adaptable. Yet here is a stray cat; i.e., probably unsocialized and skittish and scared of people, who immediately and happily jumps into Ove’s car and accompanies him on all his errands. I mean the cat actually goes into stores with him! What??? I’ve met maybe one cat that doesn’t hate riding in a car. You usually can’t even coax a cat into the car, but if you do succeed, the second the car starts moving the cat freaks out. And it’s highly unlikely that the cat would follow its new person into a store, full of strange people, sounds, smells, and objects; it’s just ludicrous. When the cat walked into McDonald’s with Ove, that was the last straw. And never mind that restaurants don’t even allow pets (including Sweden). The writer should have made the animal a dog instead of a cat, or should have talked to a cat person before writing the book.The next huge bitch I have is the way the author talks about the big guy, Jimmy. Ove makes a disparaging comment about the guy letting himself get fat. So at first, I thought, okay, so Ove doesn’t like fat people; he doesn’t like anyone, so that’s not surprising. But I quickly see it’s the author who has a problem. When the author first introduces Jimmy, he’s referred to a “quarter-tonner” who, the author says, probably tests bacon for a living! The author mentions something about Jimmy’s weight every single time Jimmy enters a scene. For instance, the author says something like “the overweight man gets into the car.” That’s like saying every time a non-overweight person gets into a car, “the height-weight proportionate man gets into the car.” Not only is it obnoxious that the author points out Jimmy’s weight every chance he gets, but isn’t it bad writing to repeat, time after time, the same feature of a particular character? He’s overweight, we get it. The author’s prejudices and insensitivities are shining through, and they aren’t pretty: Jimmy either has food hanging out of his mouth, or has food spilled on his clothes, or he’s looking for food. I hate to tell the author, but most overweight people are not slovenly and they often don’t even eat in public. His prejudice against overweight people was prominent and infuriating.But I’m not done. Let’s talk about Ove’s transformation. First, why in the hell would an upbeat woman fall in love with the jerk? Talk about an unlikable character! And why would any neighbor put up with his shit? Not believable, sorry. Second, how would his personality change over just a couple of months? People don’t transform that fast, if at all. But most important, I want to know why someone who is grumpy and mean becomes a super star when he simply turns into a civil human being. Why is he being rewarded, praised, adored, and esteemed because he finally becomes civil? Why does he get extra credit for acting civil, like everyone else is doing all along?Okay, there are a couple of fine things about the book. Ove is so well drawn, I believed every nasty word he uttered. Also, the language is good, and the story moves along seamlessly. But there are many structural and logistical problems. One time the same paragraph appears three times within 20 pages. Another time, a character disappears from a scene. This all points to a careless editor and writer. Debut book or no debut book, it shouldn’t be this sloppy.I wish I had better news. Those who aren’t bothered by cat and fat insensitivities might find Ove to be interesting and funny, and the book entertaining. I didn’t. The majority of reviews are positive. It just hit me all wrong. "

Shout out to this absolutely fabulous book in my 
 latest booktube video
 - all about the best books I read each month and 2019's bookish stats (and yes, I really did read 365 books in 365 days!).Now that you know this one made the cut - check out the video to see what other ones made my top 12 list!The written review: 
 He went through life with his hands firmly shoved into his pockets. She danced.
Ove is the quintessential grumpy old man. He lives in a little development, where he spends much of his time patrolling and reporting rule-breakers.Even when he was younger, Ove has always been...particular. He had a steward set of principles and absolutely compromised them. 
Men are what they are because of what they do. Not what they say.
 But then...Sonja came into his life.
She just smiled, said that she loved books more than anything, and started telling him excitedly what each of the ones in her lap was about. And Ove realised that he wanted to hear her talking about the things she loved for the rest of his life.
And immediately, Ove's life was forever changed.
Ove had never been asked how he lived before he met her. But if anyone had asked him, he would have answered that he didn’t.
But, after many, many blissful years of marriage, Ove is grieving. Grieving far harder than he ever would have thought possible. 
Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the great motivations for living.
Ove has always been grumpy, but since the loss of his wife, those characteristics have grown tenfold.Most, if not all, of the neighbors avoid him as much as possible...and with nothing left for him, all Ove can think about is finding a way to join Sonja...that is until a young family moves in next door. The bumbling husband and his young (and VERY pregnant wife), Parvaneh, move in, along with their two children. And suddenly his world becomes upended for the second time in his life.Three points:1) where has this book been all my life?!2) according to the audiobook, he's ""Oo-vah"". It's weird, and I'm honestly disappointed that it's not ""Love"" but without the ""L""3) this is, quite possibly, the best book everTo summarize - this one was truly one of the best books I've ever read. It is so well-written and it's has the perfect blend of heartwarming and heartwrenching. I can hardly believe how many times I almost cried...only to burst out laughing. My emotions were a roller coaster in the best way possible.The characters were incredibly real - I really felt like I could have a full conversation with all of them.And Ove! Ove is a charming old grump - and I love how this book emphasizes humanity - how even the old man down the street needs love in his life.It's just so good - PICK IT UP TODAY!Audiobook CommentsRead by George Newbern - and he really nailed it. The audiobook was so perfect - so incredible!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads"
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42130592-chai,Rating 5 out of 5,"When I finished reading this book, I closed it very gently, as though the pages were flesh that might be bruised. Something about the moment felt very fragile, and it was hard to immediately identify how I felt then: a fierce sense of joy swiftly yanked back by the leash of a sadness still incipient, a grief that had not sunk in yet. There’s a hollowness in me now, a rawness that only a novel like A Man Called Ove leaves behind. A Man Called Ove traces the story of Ove, a cranky 59-year-old Swedish man who lost his wife, then his job. Ove’s first suicide attempt is interrupted by his very pregnant and very blunt Iranian neighbor, Parvaneh, and her annoyingly sunny husband who seems determined to aggrieve Ove by not properly parking his car, and later, for the rest of the novel, by a series of comically mundane happenings “that made [Ove] sufficiently angry to hold his attention.”From such a tragic and simple premise, Backman crafts an unforgettable story about love, loss, family and friendship, with all their risks and rewards. This is probably not the best reading material for your commute, because (and speaking from experience) you will likely find yourself too immersed in your reading to remember your stop.One of the most impressive elements of this novel is the way Backman nails that perfect mix of tragedy and comedy, allowing the reader to experience fierce joy even when the story probes real grimness. He never comes off as irreverent or disrespectful, but nor does he allow the story to become too unbearably sad. The reader senses from the outset a very deep compassion between protagonist and author, and it's contagious. Ove is a very special character, and it takes, I think, a rare talent to treat this sort of character with not just respect but with sincere empathy and infectious enthusiasm.I spent most of my time reading with my heart aching for Ove. Ove, who is not a people person, who lives his life by the bullish assumption that any course of action he suggests would automatically be undertaken by those to whom he suggested it. Ove who bleeds integrity, who believes that “there’s a right way of doing things, and a wrong way.” Ove whose grumpy facade conceals a deep loneliness and an even deeper grief. It's impossible not to love Ove, and in loving him, to grieve for him (and with him). At the heart of the matter, after all, is grief; and Backman’s explorations of loss and aftermath—what it means to grieve and grieve messily, to not only mourn the loss of another, but also the loss of the hidden parts of yourself that only they could coax out of you—comes through with powerful clarity in A Man Called Ove. For years, love was a big blue wave that lifted Ove up; it shored him up, carried him home, and just when he believed it would last forever, it disappeared and left him behind. There one moment, and then gone.I don't think I've ever felt this helplessly sad reading a novel, but when I think about Ove's story, I want to think about the love Ove and his wife had for each other and the steady and undemanding affection of it; about the generous transformation of Ove’s neighbours into the most cherished of friends; about the deep steadfast stream of kindness that carries the novel; and of course, about Ove himself, the most loveable grumpy comedian in the world.I can't recommend this novel highly enough. A Man Called Ove will make you smile and it will make you cry and it will make you feel so deeply for someone who doesn’t exist but whom you'll never forget."

Everyone stated, in unison, “It is impossible not to fall in love with A Man Called Ove.”I, the queen of unpopular opinions (yes people definitely call me that, and not just me, in an attempt to get people to think it’s a nickname and start using it), thought I knew better.I did not know better.This book sneaks right into your heart. Even if you think you have a heart of stone, surrounded by a tall wall and lava and three moats with sea monsters in them, this story will crawl in when you’re not paying attention and it WILL NOT LEAVE. It will use its wittiness and its likable Scandinavian style and its grumpy protagonist and its ragtag cast of characters and its unsentimentally related moments of pure sadness, and it will make you love it. If aliens wanted to invade the world, and they wanted to take over through the sheer power of affection and charm, they could do it with A Man Called Ove and we would all be powerless to stop it.My recommendation: Don’t try to stop it. Read this book.(And HELP ME THE ALIENS HAVE GOT ME they’ve got everyone they’re COMIGN FOR YOU NEXT DON’T READ THIS BOOK--IT’S HOW THEY GET YOU--IT’S HOW THEY INVADEEEFGJHSEGFSHJDFSHHFS///////////////////////Bottom line: I, Emma, recommend this book and have definitely not been taken over by aliens!------------pre-reviewokay FINE so maybe everyone was right. review to come------------currently-reading updatesif I don't like this book, I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to sue the whole world"

7,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Received as an ARC from the publisher. Started 5-8-14. Finished 5-11-14. First let me explain what happened to me while reading this book aloud to my wife as she was preparing dinner. I'm 70; she's almost 70. I'd read the first page, laughed out loud and decided she'd like to hear it read. I read, we laughed and nodded knowingly, then I got to the end of chapter 4 and completely lost it---I couldn't continue through those last few sentences. My wife said I should quit since she knows that I cry at supermarket openings! Now how many books have you read that can cause that kind of a physical and emotional response?! On the other hand, this book is hilarious, insightful, touching and just plain awesome. It seems pretty simple at first but there is more depth to this book than any I've read in forever. As I got near the end, I thought that there really should be a sequel, then the plot changed-----definitely no sequel. But I'm thankful I had the opportunity to read this. You will too."

The author has created the most memorable character to be found in a novel --in years. *OVE*, is an unassuming man. He likes routines, and rules. He's an honest man. Doesn't smile and give compliments -- but he's a man of integrity. To watch OVE grow - heal the loss of his wife -and allow his neighbors to love him (and love them back) -- is is a treasure. This book has great humor & great heart!Its a personal gift for 'all' readers! DON'T MISS THIS GEM!"

10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53701594-nilufer-ozmekik,Rating 5 out of 5,"Fredrik Backman is one of my favorite authors who has unique gift to create deeply layered, unforgettable, quirky, irritating characters who achieve to conquer our hearts when they show their true colors by sharing their vulnerability honestly, sensitivity genuinely. Ove seems like one of the grumpiest characters of the literature history. He never smiles. He doesn’t like saying nice things to people around him. He has his principles. He likes his special routine. He is straightforward, telling his opinions with pure and ugly honesty. But when you learn his traumatic past and how he loses his wife, your biased thoughts about him start to change and as he starts to connect with his neighbors and touch their lives, we realize he has a golden hearted, interestingly one of a kind man who steals a special part of your heart. This is one of my favorite works of the author and I chose to listen its audiobook for my flashback Saturday reading. ( when mercury is in the retrograde, those flashback reading become more meaningful!) Narrator George Newbern ( I know him as Scandal series’ quirky contact killer Charlie! ) did an amazing job! I highly recommend you to give it a try! Here are my favorite quotes of the book: “We always think there's enough time to do things with other people. Time to say things to them. And then something happens and then we stand there holding on to words like 'if'.”“Men are what they are because of what they do. Not what they say.”“You only need one ray of light to chase all the shadows away”“But sorrow is unreliable in that way. When people don’t share it there’s a good chance that it will drive them apart instead.”"

Backman and Jonas Jonasson are the trendsetters of a new style of comedic writing I couldn´t point my finger at how it´s done, it´s as if the long, dark winters have infiltrated the comedy sector and left chasms behind each second corner.Passages describing the main protagonist as unfriendly, grumpy misanthrope switch with retrospectives and friendly actions, leading to the inner fragmentation of the badass old fellow.Many call this new comedy genre banal and too constructed, because it doesn´t give much about writing conventions, but I find both Backman and Jonas highly refreshing, like their direct and quick plotted style, and how they mix real and fictional elements together to construct a mixture of history, fiction, and satire. Not my average reading, but one of the cases where looking over the reading fence and the borders genre preferences often subtly dictate to readers has been a full success, possibly I´ll read one more of Backmans´ works. For readers who are in emotional and character driven works, it´s close to a must read, although I don´t know so much about those genres, so that my objective recommendation should be taken with a grain of salt. Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph..."

The writing/English translation of Ove's story is top-notch. The story-line itself plays very well with this character study.The story moves forward, then comes a little back story, we move forward again and this pace continues through out the book at finely tuned measurements. But that's not why 5 stars. My 5 stars comes because every time the story moved forward, someone touched on my emotions. And every time I read another piece of back story, Ove or his wife(Sonja) pulled on my emotions. So halfway into the book and there is a slight feeling of attachment starting to take hold. And by the end of the book there was solid emotional investment ... it's worth it. excerpts are spoiler(ish)page 11 narration ""Won't it be nice to slow down a bit?"" they said to Ove yesterday at work.

Suddenly he's a bloody ""generation."" ""Ove glares out of the window. The poser is jogging. Not that Ove is provoked by jogging. Not at all. Ove couldn't give a damn about people jogging. What he can't understand is why they have to make such a big thing of it. With those smug smiles on their faces, as if they were out there curing pulmonary emphysema. Is it really necessary to dress up as a fourteen-year-old Romanian gymnast in order to be able to do it?"" page 18/19 narration '""Holy Christ.

This book, I mean THIS BOOK deserves a 5 star rating. If I could give it more than I would, but alas I cannot. :(So, here's the review. Greif is a strange thing, I have heard many people say. I have lost people in my life, but not in the way that Ove has in this book. Ove mother dies when he is young, leaving Ove and his father. His father taught Ove how to be a man in so many ways. He was taught that a Saab was the best car to purchase, which Ove goes above and beyond to stay loyal to that car company. His father taught him how to work and cook and love. Then, Ove looses his father when he is 16. This leaves Ove in a bad place, he literally becomes a hermit in a way and doesn't talk or bother with people anymore. He takes over his father's job. Then there were some issues with that, but Ove was honest and trusting and he came out on top of that issue!Ove then meets Sonja when he is on a bus. Buses have a lot to do with this story come to think of it. Ove finds his wife and the love of his life on that bus that day. He also looses a lot on a bus on a different day - but you'll have to read the book to find that part out ;). Ove and Sonja moved into a row home together and shortly after Sonja passes away. This leaves Ove with nothing and he doesn't know what to do with himself. He lived his life to please her and now she is gone. Here's the thing about grief, people deal with it in all kinds of ways. Ove was dealing with it in the worst way you could, until his new neighbors moved in. This is where the book gets going really, and I don't want to say too much because I think it is really important that if you want to read this book that you get the entire story how it was intended by the Author. Moral of my little review, Ove was a mean, grumpy, miserable man until those neighbors moved in and that brought Ove out of his shell. He was needed by people again and he felt wanted. He became a family with everyone in the neighborhood all because of that little family who lived across the street.Some things to remember when you are reading this book:1.) Buses2.) Pink Flowers3.) Saab's4.) Rules - Ove was NOT a rule breaker5.) Love6.) Hands - an odd one, but true!7.) White ShirtsThis is the end of my review. I loved this book and I feel like I will reread this one many times when I feel alone or upset or just want to read a damn good book!If you have any questions or want to know more about it than I have told you, please private message me.Enjoy reading this wonderful book! :)"
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12620745-debbie-dj,Rating 2 out of 5,"When I began reading A Man Called Ove, I thought what a clever tale of an angry old man. The kind that believes rules and regulations are of utmost importance, that see the world filled with stupid people, and is always right. The way the author describes him and his actions are hilarious, as I have known a few Oves myself. They have their principles! The only person Ove had and loved dearly, was his wife, Sonja. She has just passed away, and all Ove wants to do is kill himself, but those pesky neighbors keep getting in his way!I was enjoying all the fun until about the 40% mark, then I started getting angry myself. It is always others who make Ove begrudgingly do the right thing. It was always his wife who made all the excuses for him as a basically non-functioning adult.There were two items in particular that I really didn't like. The first was his cat, a stray, whom if not for his neighbors he would have let die. The second is a neighbor called Jimmy. Jimmy is overweight, and the constant references to food hanging out of his mouth, and stains on his shirt were just plain rude.I pressed on even though it was getting tough to read. There was one paragraph near the ending about getting older that touched my heart, but other than that, it was just more of the same. The author, Fredrik Backman, is a blogger, and this is his first novel. He is a good writer, and I can see how blogs of Ove would be fun, but as a whole book it just didn't work for me...but, I am in the minority!"

This one is going to endure through the ages. I have always advocated that voice is the “everything,” in writing and Ove is just about all voice. The high level-superior writing craft made the voice work so well. The chapters alternate between past tense and present tense seamlessly and add to the level of craft and storytelling. Another amazing thing about this book is that it’s all about Ove’s grief and depression over the loss of his wife Sofia and yet the author holds the reader entranced with the old curmudgeon as he continues to evolve through the story. There are minor subplots and micro-conflicts that service the plot all the while the evolution of the character services the theme. There is only one thing I did not enjoy about the writing; the over use of adverbs and I wonder if it happened in translation.This one took a little longer because I wanted to savor the craft, the story, the wonderful method the author utilized.

20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21022310-claire-humphrey,Rating 1 out of 5,"After glancing at the cover copy, I made a prediction that this book would be about a grumpy old white guy whose life would be cheered up by some combination of the following: a manic pixie dream girl, a singing and dancing person of colour, a plucky person with a disability, and a pet. I was right on all counts, sadly.This book was so predictable that I made a game out of it in order to get through. It never deviated from its formula, pressing every saccharine button along the way, sliding over heavy topics with almost offensive levity. I can see why some readers might find this predictability and lightness satisfying or comforting, but it wasn't for me at all."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899836-snotchocheez,Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5 starsI've read all my GR friends' wildly divergent reviews of Fredrik Backman's debut novel  A Man Called Ove and can find something to agree with in each of them. Nods to those who enjoyed the comedy of errors. Nods to the ailurophiles who despised Ove's treatment of the cat. Nods to those who couldn't get enough of Ove's archetypal curmudgeonly character. Nods to those who found Ove's transformation from hating the world to being a reluctant hero an unlikely and transparently feel-good-y affair.My assessment: cute but repetitive, not nearly as funny as it needs to be, rendered trite by its obvious similarity to other, better comedic works, slathered with life-lesson goop, and adorned with a way-too-predictable wreath of lingonberries and happy happy joy joy.Or maybe I'm just as curmudgeonly as Ove, so never mind me."
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is an excellent heartwarming and humorous book. Basically, a series of short stories about a man called Ove that all combine together into an awesome all-encompassing storyline.Ove is a grumpy old man who has a cynical approach to everything. But, how he got this way, combined with the relationships he ""accidentally"" develops lead to a lot of unexpected twists and turns.One of the things I loved about this book is that seemingly serious situations end up hilarious, while scenes that seem to be completely for comic relief can really pull on your heart strings. I went from laughter to tears on the turn of a dime while I listened to this book.Also, If you like interesting characters, this is the book for you. Every character is fascinating in their own right. I will miss them all! Can't say for sure, but I think most people will enjoy those book."

24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6743601-jim-fonseca,Rating 3 out of 5,"I think I’ll be a dissenter on this one, giving it only a ‘3.’ A brief review because there are so many good ones already. Ove is a curmudgeon. His life is lived in black and white. There are rules to follow and if you don’t follow them, look out. He posts warning signs in his suburban townhouse development in Sweden and he bangs on your car window if you bring you vehicle in where they are prohibited. Or if you park illegally. Or if you rest you bike against the tool shed. Or walk your dog on his piece of lawn. He even gets mad at a feral cat trespassing. He can’t understand why any normal person would buy a car other than a Saab. Needless to say, he has no friends and doesn’t want any. He’s particularly adept at battling bureaucrats. It’s one of his few enjoyments in life.He’s even worse now that has his wife has died. We know this at the beginning of the story. She kept him in line and his love for her was his only purpose in life. Now that she’s gone – and let’s put it this way: he wants to join her on the other side. He brings flowers to the cemetery and talks with her. He makes several attempts to ‘join her’ but each time he gets interrupted by having to take someone in the neighborhood to the hospital. A newly arrived Iranian family is particularly persistent in trying to befriend him and get him back into society. We know that underneath that prickly exterior, Ove has a heart of gold, which is why he had a wife he could only dream of. Grudgingly, resisting all the way, he takes tiny steps back into society, getting involved with the neighbors’ kids and taking into his home a young man thrown out by his father when the boy revealed he was gay. So, a good story with humor but I guess I didn’t like all the farcical attempts to join his wife and it got repetitive for me. The book is translated from the Swedish. It was made into a movie in Sweden in 2016. The author has written several other well-regarded novels including Beartown, My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry and Britt-Marie Was Here.

I did not expect to spend almost half an hour crying my eyes out after finishing it - and yet, that's exactly what I did. Ove is a grumpy old man. He wants things to be ""right"" and doesn't think twice about the fact that he isn't always perceived as fair - and that always keeping to the truth can actually make people stay away from you. This book is a journey. For Ove, for Ove's surroundings and for the reader. It is a magnificent tale about true love, Saab and the fact that what you see isn't always what you get. "

Every once in a while, you have to change things up a little. 'A Man Called Ove' was a great choice for me.Ove is a wonderful character. He is opinionated, cantankerous and utterly set in his ways. He is a man that has been left behind in many ways, unwilling to adapt and unable to understand the thought process that drives ""modern man"" in this technological era.When his new neighbor's failed attempts to back a trailer up draws his attention, it is only the first of many humorous interactions to come. Despite his unpleasant disposition and perpetual crankiness, Ove seems to constantly be coming to the rescue of his newest neighbors. He comes off as ""hard"" at first, but it quickly becomes clear that he is a softie.A series of comical and heart-warming events play out, which kept me laughing and smiling. Little by little, we are provided glimpses of Ove's past, experiencing the love he has for his deceased wife and the events that shaped him into the man he became. Slowly but surely, I fell in love with this gruff old man.Determined to end his life and join his wife, fate combined with his his infallible values and sense of civic duty to repeatedly postpone his suicide. There's always something that he has to take care of before he can draw his last breath. Time after time, his plans are thwarted.Overall, I thought this was a fantastic story. Everybody needs an Ove in their life! "

It wasn’t supposed to be like this. It used to be you could rely on a good somber Nordic tragedy, something dark and brooding, something that would stick with you all winter. None of this sentimental pap, the old saws about pensioned off widowers who only have themselves and their silly routines to worry about. Not that old people aren’t funny, and not just funny ha ha. Actually they’re hysterical. But that doesn’t mean they’re emotionally crippled or demented or need some sort of redemption. Who says nobody looks forward to retirement? Are you kidding? Sleeping in, no deadlines, horrid workmates and endless tedious meetings a thing of the past. This is as close to heaven as you’re ever going to get... if you’re lucky. So why write about an old man (well middle-aged actually at 59, a kid really) as if he were a child lost at the zoo? Why? I’ll tell you why: So he can have his soul saved by a too-sweet-to-be-wholesome Japanese family. That’s why. Pure sentimentality. It’s good box office. But It was never meant to be like this. Time was when movies were films and books were literature. Films made you laugh and cry and throw up lunch; literature made you consider and think and connect things. It’s all mixed up now. Who knows what writers write for anymore - for an ‘awwwwh’ and a lump in the throat it looks like. And don’t get me started on the way they use kids - the biggest-brown-eyes-you’ve-ever-seen ploy. That was old before they had talkies. Child exploitation I call it. And yeah sure I lost my wife not too long ago. It was tough for a while. But you think anyone my age is a novice at this loss and suffering thing? Get over yourself. How many people my age still have their parents? No one I know. Most have lost a sibling or two. Some have lost children, and not just to death. There are worse things than death that today’s snowflakes know nothing about, like drug addictions, and mental handicaps, and wasting illness, like decades of physical suffering by folks you’ve loved, and like, yeah dementia. You’re the amateur, mate. I’ve been round the block. I can take it on the chin without making myself a misery for other people, or even for myself. So all’s I can say is it wasn’t supposed to be like this. But it is like this and I’m OK with that.

Not your typical romance - to be loved like this is every woman's dream! I was immediately drawn to Ove from page one. He is blunt, straightforward, impatient with little concern for political-correctness - but I couldn't help admiring him. I was laughing and crying throughout the book! As you read, you realize that his anger and grumpiness towards the world seems justified, but deep down, he does have a soft spot in his heart. This book, one of those rare stories that is so hard to put down, is one that makes you think - before you judge other people, remember that each person has their own story. I highly recommend this book!"

the sheer amount of emotion the book somehow pulled out of me made my head throb.this book was so difficult for me to read. i had to take many breaks in between the chapters and sometimes in the middle of the chapters. something about the writing had me in agony while i was reading. ove is a grumpy, mean old man. very mean. he does, says, and thinks the rudest stuff. he thinks very much in black and white. except when it comes to her. she is everything. she is his light, his colour, his better half. when he thinks about her, it’s always pretty. 

”People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was colour. All the colour he had.”

they have contrasting personalities, but they balance each other out. they are complete opposites, yet they work harmoniously. their love is described so beautifully. the way they expressed their love for one another constantly brought me to tears. it was so tender. so sweet. he was so good to her. she was so good to him.this is more than just a story about love though. it’s about friendship, family, loss, grief, community. it was so heartbreakingly beautiful.quotes that murdered me: “He never understood why she chose him. He went through life with his hands firmly shoved into his pockets. She danced.”“A time like that comes for all men, when they choose what sort of men they want to be. And if you don’t know the story you don’t know the men.”“She had brown hair and blue eyes and red shoes and a big yellow clasp in her hair. And then there was no more peace and quiet for Ove.”“He had never been spontaneous before in his life. But when he saw her it was as if something malfunctioned.”“She just smiled, said that she loved books more than anything, and started telling him excitedly what each of the ones in her lap was about. And Ove realised that he wanted to hear her talking about the things she loved for the rest of his life.”“He was destined to spend so many quarter-hours of his life waiting for her.”“Sorrow does strange things to living creatures.”“I feel so much loss, Ove. Loss, as if my heart was beating outside my body. You have to love me twice as much now.”“You’re the funniest thing she knows. That’s why she always draws you in colour.”“Maybe their sorrow should have brought [them] closer. But sorrow is unreliable in that way. When people don’t share it there’s a good chance that it will drive them apart instead.”“What sort of love is it if you hand someone over when it gets difficult? Abandon someone when there’s resistance?““One of the most painful moments in a person’s life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead.”“Love is a strange thing. It takes you by surprise.”“Ove had never been asked how he lived before he met her. But if anyone had asked him, he would have answered that he didn’t.”───im shaking im crying i can barely think straight. i just basically went through all 5 stages of grief over and over and over again. maya you’re paying for my therapy.───maya forced me to start this 🫡"
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,Rating 5 out of 5,"A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman is a 2014 Atria publication. After I read ‘Britt-Marie Was Here’ and really enjoyed it, my Goodreads friends strongly recommended this book, and were positive I would love it. I vowed to fit the book in as quickly as possible, and was thankful my library had a copy and the wait list wasn’t monstrous. I have no idea where to begin! This an amazing story, with the most interesting characters, humorous and emotional situations. The writing is unusual, with present tense mingled with past tense. Ove appears, in the beginning, as though he is a cranky old man, maybe a little anal, but there is also a loneliness surrounding him, and a sense of despair. As the story progresses, we learn about Ove’s background, his marriage, and how he got to this point where he attempts to end his life, but is always inadvertently prevented from succeeding. Ove may have been reserved, but his life has meant more, and his influence has reached further, than he ever thought. Every person has a history. We see people on the surface, without knowing anything about them, and make judgements. I did that with Ove in the beginning, but by the end of the book, my opinion of him and respect for him had grown immeasurably. I loved the various secondary characters, including the cat and of course the Saab!! But, the relationship between Sonja and Ove is the most poignant and effective part of the novel. “Ove had never been asked how he lived before he met her. But if anyone had asked him, he would have answered that he didn’t.”Although Ove is dragged out of his shell kicking and screaming, he finally begins to live again, in the most eccentric, but enchanting way! This book lived up to any and all of my expectations and then some!! 4.5 stars"

A Man Called Ove is the story of an occasionally rude and eternally stubborn - but well meaning (maybe…) - old man, who appears grumpy and antisocial at first sight, but is really an absolute sweetheart underneath it all. There's so much more to him than first meets the eye, and when a new family move in next door, they do their best to discover the real Ove, and find his good soul underneath all that stubborn spirit.It's a story of love, friendship and the importance of a good car, but more than that, it's a story about the growth of people, and the different ways in which someone can show affection. I feel like this is a book for all ages - it’s heartwarming, funny, and helps you try to see the good in people. It has so many important messages and is written so beautifully - I cannot recommend it enough!Hilarious and heartbreaking, Ove's story caused me to burst into tears more than once, and manages to make me do so again throughout every reread.

Ove is a grump. He’s bitter, rude, hates people (kinda) and is a stickler for rules. On the surface level, he’s not a nice man. But then we delve and dig deeper into his past and as things start to unfold, his character begins to make more sense. He has every right to be the miserable, old grump that he is. This was such a heartwarming story about love, loss, community, kindness and neighbours being there for each other. I loved being in Ove’s head. I loved how he viewed the world and how utterly good he was. Till life really handed it to him, but he never lost his essence. It just got buried beneath the onslaught of constant pain in his life. But he found people and love which allowed him to uncover those parts of himself again. It was amazing to go on this journey with him.————————————We have a grumpy character. We have a constantly moody character who frankly, dislikes people. I may have found my bookish soulmate."

Why This Book

I run a monthly poll on the ThisIsMyTruthNow blog via my Book Bucket List. Followers get to choose from a list of the twelve books I own and want to read in the near future. A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman was selected as the book I should read in March 2018. I added it to the list because I really enjoyed his novel, Beartown, and thought this was the next logical step. A good friend of mine was interested in reading the novel, too, so we made this a buddy read. I'm so excited to discuss the book as if it's our own book club.

Approach & Style

I was going to order the book online, but I found it sitting on the shelf in my apartment building's library room; how lucky am i? The paperback is 337 pages long and broken into ~40 chapters (not  numbered). Each has a title which explains what might happen in the chapter, and they mostly alternate between what is happening today in Ove's life in comparison to something connected that occurred in the past. It took me 4 hours to read over a three-day weekend getaway to New Hampshire, but I forced myself to stop at 110 pages each day so it would last longer. It could easily be read in one sitting as it's that good! The novel's perspective is focused on Ove, and it is told in third-person omniscient POV. It was published in 2014 but as a Swedish novel, then brilliantly translated into English.

Plot, Characters & Setting

Ove is a 59-year old man who is cantankerous, ornery, difficult, mean and everything else that comes along with the type of men you'd see in the movie ""Grumpy Old Men."" It opens with a bit about an iPad that is basically someone we all know (or are -- I see my own future in a good 20+ years). But he of course has a heart somewhere, and we spend the entirety of the book seeing little pieces of it as we watch his journey to try to complete a final goal. We meet several of his neighbors and former friends, a few citizens of his community, and some strangers who all have an impact on Ove's life, but are also touched by the time they spend with Ove.It's difficult to summarize more about the book without giving away big pieces of the plot, but it is a story that will make you cry and laugh at the same time on several occasions. Imagine a man you would not want to meet in person slowly tugging at your heart strings because you see and understand all he's been through that's turned him into the person we read about today. When you learn what his actual goal is, you'll be shocked and struggle to accept that you want to support him in it. And when the things he's always wanted but could never quite have suddenly start appearing in his life, you'll know you can't help but love the grumpy old man.

Key Thoughts

Fredrik Backman is hands-down one of my favorite character-building authors. Ove has so many levels to him you will lose count trying to guess what he might do in any given situation. His first reaction will almost always annoy you. His second will irritate you beyond belief... could he really have lost all humanity? But by the third or fourth time he encounters a situation, you see the tides turning. That's where Backman excels. No matter how harsh he makes someone, the character teeters on the edge until they fall sweepingly into your arms as someone you now love and root for.Despite reading the reviews and guessing enough of the high-level plot from the descriptions, I was not prepared for all the emotions in this book. The story captures different aspects of life and tries to make sense of them in reverse order. We aren't reading Ove's past in any logical format or order. It's bits and pieces, re-told at appropriate points in his current life. In the opening scenes, he's yelling at an iPad sales clerk... and we think he's just an irate older man who can't 'get with the times.' But when you learn everything that led up to it, you'll find so many new connections. The order of the chapters is brilliant. You know people dislike one another, but not why. You find out way after you think you will, and it makes total sense. An author who can keep that going for 300+ pages is phenomenal.I kept thinking 'What if Ove meets the main character from The Five People You Meet in Heaven?' Would they get along? They're basically the same person, but completely different. From the plot to the story, the dialogue to the narrative, this book will capture your attention, enthrall your senses, tease you, torture you, and in the end, make you wish there were more. I can't recommend it enough! You'll even laugh out loud so often, people will look at you quite funny.

Summary

I am so thrilled with my second Fredrik Backman book that I plan to read all of his remaining works this summer. I have a copy of Beartown 2 which I will read next month, but then it will be My Grandmother Asked Me To Tell You She's Sorry and Britt-Marie Was Here. There are others, but those are up next on the spring and summer reading lists. I don't think I could be disappointed as I am addicted to his writing style and storytelling abilities. He's definitely in my top 10 favorite authors thus far in my reading lifetime."

Ove has a plan to commit suicide after the death of his wife stripped him of his life companion. She understood his odd traits and knew the soul and heart of him, where no other had ventured. The fact that he can't bear to live without her is understandable and Backman exposes the grief without getting bogged down in detail or overplaying the suffering. Ove plans his actions with such clarity of thought and reasoning, even down to the concern of leaving a mess for those that will find him, so he covers the ground with plastic sheeting. The entertaining balance to the inherent sadness of the situation comes in the form of a new family moving in next door. The family along with a stray cat continuously interrupt his plans at the most inopportune moments. Ove finds himself belligerently doing just one more favour for them before he can settle down to complete his own mission.There are deep implications in this story that cause us to think about the elderly, those that are dealing with grief, loneliness and loss of purpose. How is it that the elderly start to feel excluded and removed from the everyday beat of society? All these issues are delicately woven into this novel to paint a common experience of being widowed and drifting into isolation where the only respite is death.There are many times throughout the book I laughed out loud, especially at Ove’s conviction of how things should be and his tetchiness with those who don’t see things his way. Humour in the darkest times often reverberates loudest.It is ultimately a heart-warming story of humanity, as Ove deals with the loss of his wife and just how communities can be supportive and socially uplifting. This is a great book to read and I would highly recommend it."

I've always favored them in real life because probably I'm one of those people who tolerate little bullshit and they fit that for me.Plus most of them really don't like people. 

Ove is my kind of people. He comes across as a pretty big curmudgeon. All he wants to do is commit suicide. People won't leave him alone long enough to do it. He misses his outgoing wife and doesn't think he has much to live for. Then the neighbors move in down the street. The lanky dad backs over Ove's garden because the idiot can't back a trailer, Mom is pregnant and bossy, and two kids.They won't leave Ove alone. They even saddle him with an aggravation cat.I can't seem to figure out how to do the best words when I really love a book. Just picture the hallelujah light over my head when it finally happens.

He is raised to be and does becomes a decent, good man. He’s an honest, unassuming man, who falls in love with a beautiful, smart woman, who falls in love with him.

His plans are interrupted every day by one quirky neighbor or another but especially by the family next door . Ove continues to show kindness to the people around him in spite of what appears to be a mean temperament and these people come to love him and you suspect he cares about them, too.It's predictable and sometimes a bit melodramatic but it will make you laugh and cry and you'll be glad that you met Ove.Thanks to NetGalley and Atria Books"

I have just discovered Fredrik Backman’s novels and read three of them in the last month. I can’t say which I liked the best—they are all stellar. I am thrilled to have two more yet to read!Gosh, what a wonderful slice of life this is. Ove is a curmudgeon, but he has his reasons for that. Though he lacks social skills (every one of them), his heart is solid (but don’t ever tell him that). Ove’s wife is the only person on earth who understands Ove, and after she dies (not a spoiler), all he wants to do is die. Seriously. But things and annoying people (and a cat) continue to get in the way of his ultimate goal.What a cast of characters! No stereotypes here. Brilliantly written in simple language with plenty of Christine-type humor. I loved this guy from the get-go, a striking thing as I generally do not do dislikable characters in the role of the protagonist. But actually I liked Ove right from the start. Maybe because I had met Britt-Marie first. In any event, this is a masterful character study of a crochety, determined, principled, opinionated, cantankerous, good-hearted (who knew?) old crank. This story highlights the power of living, the importance of human relationships, and the satisfaction of doing unto others (even if under protest). My heart was touched, and I cried towards the end. If I were in charge, I would deem this a must-read classic for all to learn from. Ove, you will be missed by me for a very long time.Many thanks to the Rochester (MN) Public Library and the Libby App for the loan of this outstanding novel."

A life, mind you, he feels cheated him. Each chapter pulls back another layer to Ove, revealing his thoughts, experiences, heartache and what makes Ove, well, Ove. A new family moves in next door which irritates the old man, but it forces him to face long hard questions about himself. It has some slow parts that made me yawn a few times but I hung in there. Needs to be cleaned up for a more interesting read but it was a touching story overall.

Okay, then why is he CONSTANTLY pointing out their differences?The neighbor is overweight (according to Ove) and there is not a paragraph that goes by with the neighbor that he doesn't insult his appearance and lifestyle. There is a gay barista who Ove openly calls slurs even when others point out the wrongness of it.The woman next door is always mentioned as ""tan skinned woman"" or ""dark skinned woman"" or ""foreigner"" or some such and I'm like whaaaaa?I know people like Ove exist. I live in the south. I can't spit without hitting one of them. But I don't like seeing them put on a pedestal. Ove is an absolute ass to everyone around him but they all treat him with love and kindness. Love and kindness he doesn't deserve I might add. Why are they so nice to him? This is a Scrooge situation. Clearly Ove is going through a rough time due to the death of his beloved wife. But I have several problems stemming from that. First off, why did she love him? There is no chemistry between the characters. The wife's family and friends all tell her not to marry him and that he is a bad person. But she does it anyway. Of COURSE. Also, he is seen in every flashback and recollection, being a dick. It's not like he magically transformed due to the grief of his wife passing. He's always been an ass. Now he's just an ass who's also depressed. Just cause someone's depressed doesn't mean you need to condone their every action and sentiment. He doesn't get to shit on everyone around him just because he is sad. That's not how it works pal.I hated the ending of this book. Like, what the ever loving fuck?

When I met Ove, he was harassing a hapless sales assistant at the Apple Store. I felt great sympathy for the sales guy. There's little I have patience for but I am especially ungraceful to luddites. Ove was only 59 at the time. I didn't understand why he was such an old man.But of course, I was wrong to think so unkindly of Ove. The thing about old people is that they have always seen and done more than we ever have. They have reached the point in their lives where they have more to remember than look forward to. And what a gift that is if you lived a beautiful life.Ove's life wasn't just beautiful. It was magical. From when he was a young boy, I was introduced to his father who was a man of just as few words as him. The kind of man who needs little to be happy. Men who only required a few simple things from life... A roof over their heads, a quiet street, the right make of car, and a woman to be faithful to. A job where you had a proper function. A house where things broke at regular intervals, so you always had something to tinker with.Ove grew up with his own tribulations. A bully at his workplace, extravagant con artists and unabated bureaucrats. He was the kind of man who had great innate strength which he hid with his bark which was a lot louder than his bite... if he even had one. He was the kind of man who attracted the love of the kindest woman, the frenemity of the most stubborn man, the curiosity of the most audacious reporter, the admiration of the most woebegone neighbour, the haven to the neighbourhood teens and the loyalty of the alley cat. He was the kind of man who was the nemesis of government officials. And the grandfather of the neighbour's little girls. He was the kind of man who made me cry, laugh, and learn. I was unkind when I first saw Ove but by the end of his story, I too wanted him to be my grandfather. I too wanted him to be happy. I too wanted him to have all the love and peace in the world. There are many people who deserve all the good things. Ove is definitely one of them. He has my heart. And I have a feeling that he would've made space for it in his big one if he was real.

Ove is a surly man who keeps to himself. He cares about rules, routine, and being left alone to go about his business. His quiet life is upended by chatty new neighbors who flatten his mailbox, drive over his flowerbed, and insert themselves into his house and his life with careless disregard for his needs. Though Ove prefers to be free of their nuisance interruptions, they’re the first of many whose lives enmesh with his. If Ove’s not careful, he may find himself caring about someone other than himself. Backman has created a highly memorable protagonist. Ove is a pragmatic man who “checks the status of all things,” who believes in principles, who understands things he can “see and touch,” who has no friends and doesn’t need them, who likes mathematics, and who shoves his hands in his pockets “in that particular way of a middle-aged man who expects the worthless world outside to disappoint him. He’s a delightful old man who’s irascible, morose, and unintentionally funny. “That disgusting thing scratched Prince!” she manages to say, her eyes wild with fury. Ove peers down at [her dog]. It growls at him. Then he looks at the cat, sitting humiliated and bleeding but with its head defiantly raised, outside his house. “It’s bleeding. So it seems to have ended in a draw,” says Ove. “Like hell. I’ll kill that piece of shit!” “No you wont,” says Ove coldly. His insane neighbor begins to look threatening. “It’s probably full of disgusting diseases and rabies and all sorts of things!” Ove looks at the cat. Looks at [her]. Nods. “And so are you, most likely. But we don’t throw stones at you because of it.” However, beneath Ove’s toughened exterior is a story of heartbreak, disappointment, and tragedy. Never before has a character been kicked down – and then kicked while he’s down – so many times in one story. Ove is convinced his life holds little value but, as he inadvertently collects strays – in the form of a ragged cat and a cast of diverse neighbors – he sees the first glimmers of purpose. His woeful story transforms into a triumphant exploration of the way one person can change the life of countless others. A Man Called Ove is a stupendous read that brings forth laughter and tears in equal measure."
55,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon-darth-anyan,Rating 5 out of 5,"A man named Ove knocked on my door and asked if I have space on my shelves for a stray book about an angry, bitter, contrarian,  suicidal  old man. I hesitated for a second, thinking I don't need to get more depressed than I already am, but then I took another look at his wooden clogs, his out-of-fashion clothes and frowning brow, and decided: ""What the heck! I'll give it a try! I'll read a couple of chapters and see how I feel about it."" Ove is fifty-nine.He drives a Saab. He's the kind of man who points at people he doesn't like the look of, as if they were burglars and his forefinger a policeman's flashlight. Ove is the genuine ""Get off my damn lawn!"" article, lashing out at all the young yuppies and self-employed slackers that are moving into his neighborhood, ignoring his clearly marked interdiction signs and regulations. He stomps his feet and he fumes and he rages at a whole world gone to pot. [ Misanthropy  is the general hatred, distrust or contempt of the human species or human nature. A misanthrope or misanthropist is someone who holds such views or feelings. ] [from wikipedia]A man called Ove might have reasons to behave the way he does. The world has not treated him kindly in his almost six decades of living. He'd been a grumpy old man since he started elementary school, they insisted. , but Ove has had to deal with hardship, injustice and mistrust for just as long. Society, through its institutions, has done nothing to improve his philosophy of life. On the contrary, it has repeatedly rallied against him in every way possible.  Orphaned at an early age, Ove abandons school to start working in a rail depot. Later he rebuilds a house with his own hands, only to have it burned to ground in a suspect arson attack while the firemen and neighbours enjoy the show. He falls in love, and his wife gets crippled for life by a drunken driver, miscarrying their child. She dies years later of an incurrable disease, and a few months after he buries her Ove is let go from his job. So I say: Ove has no reason at all to smile and be accomodating The novel alternates between the present day clashes a man called Ove has with his pesky neighbors and flashbacks of his past experiences, first as a lonely young man with a talent for manual labor (A job well done is a reward in its own right, as his father used to say.), and later as the surprised husband of a lively young woman. People said he was bitter. Maybe they were right . He'd never reflected much on it. People called him antisocial. Ove assumed this meant he wasn't overly keen on people. And in this instance he could totally agree with them. More often than not people were out of their minds. [...]People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had. Her name is Sonja and she is everything that Ove is not : outgoing, laughing at the smallest provocation, dedicated to her work as a teacher helping others to enjoy literature. Why would she shackle herself to a frowning bear like Ove? He never understood why she chose him. She loved abstract things like music and books and strange words. Ove was a man entirely filled with tangible things. He liked screwdrivers and oil filters. He went through life with his hands firmly shoved into his pockets. She danced.  But to Sonja, Ove was never dour and awkward and sharp-edged. To her, he was the slightly disheveled pink flowers at their first dinner. He was his father's slightly too tight-fitting brown suit across his broad, sad shoulders. He believed so strongly in things: justice and fair play and hard work and a world where right just had to be right. Not so one could get a medal or a diploma or a slap on the back for it, but just because that was how it was supposed to be. Not many men of his kind were made any more, Sonja had understood. So she was holding on to this one. The story of their life together unfolds in reluctant confessions from Ove, details that emerge slowly and painfully from his tight fisted grip. He's a doer, not a talker, but most of all he is holding on to these memories as the most precious possession he ever had, his magnetic north and his only reason for staying alive. Ove had never been asked how he lived before he met her. But if anyone had asked him, he would have answered that he didn't. In one of these memories of his past, Ove tells us how he built a house with his own hands, learning the trade by apprenticing himself to a construction company. In my favorite metaphor from the book (not an original one, but who cares when Backman is so eloquent) , Sonja explains their love in building terms anybody could relate to: Loving someone is like moving into a house. At first you fall in love with all the new things, amazed every morning that all this belongs to you, as if fearing that someone would suddenly come rushing in through the door to explain that a terrible mistake had been made, you weren't actually supposed to live in a wonderful place like this. Then over the years the walls become weathered, the wood splinters here and there, and you start to love the house not so much because of all its perfection, bur rather for its imperfections. You get to know all the nooks and crannies. How to avoid getting the key caught in the lock when it's cold outside. Which of the floorboards flex slightly when one steps on them or exactly how to open the wardrobe doors without them creaking. These are the little secrets that make it your house. Compared to this polychromatic past with Sonja, the present day apears to Ove only in shades of darker and darker grey. Without his wife's sunny counterweight, his disposition grows more bitter and contrarian by the hour. Could those pesky neighbors tame the ogre and convince him that life is worth living?I am not going to give an answer here for fear of spoilers, but I can't help noticing that at some point of the novel I felt like I have wondered off into the set for one of those classic Frank Capra movies where Jimmy Stewart is convinced that his life is a mess and then the whole town rallies to demonstrate the opposite. Some exigent readers might be turned off by the sentimentality and the artificiality of these developments (I myself thought that he was laying the sugar on pretty thick in places), pointing out that in real life people are selfish and cruel and indifferent to the woes of their next door neighbors, but I will counter their argument with a quote from another of my favorite authors: “People ask me to predict the future, when all I want to do is prevent it. Better yet, build it. Predicting the future is much too easy, anyway. You look at the people around you, the street you stand on, the visible air you breathe, and predict more of the same. To hell with more. I want better.” According to Ray Bradbury (and John Lennon) the role of art is not simply to reflect reality, but to point the way to a better state of existence. In order to bring any change about we must first imagine what kind of world we would like to live in, and then we have to realise that it is up to each of us to make it happen through the small choices we make day by day. Fredrik Backman may have written only a fairytale, a feelgood tragicomedy, but I know that for the time spent in the company of this man Ove I left my critical faculties by the door and imagined myself moving to his neighborhood in order to find some peace of mind and some friends I could rely on. People can say whatever they like about you, Ove. But you're the strangest superhero I ever heard about. - - - -The story is finished. I turn the last page, gaze once more at the cover and then at my overburdened shelves. What should I do with you, Ove? Send you back to the street like the stray cat that sits at your heels? Or maybe slip you in next to that big tome on Guernsey, so you can have some conversations about the way these modern kids know nothing about life with a man called Ebenezer? Yeah! I think the last one will work best."
56,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"Top ten reasons you might be like Ove:10. The term “curmudgeon” applies to you.9. Young men with neck tattoos fear you.8. Clowns fear you.7. Computer sales associates groan when you come around with questions.6. You’re not the sort of person who goes around telling what other people do.5. If your wife is the day, then you are clearly the night – and that’s OK.4. You understand that listening to a beautiful woman is far more important than speaking.3. You like numbers better than words – numbers are black and white and with straight lines and there are right and wrong answers.2. You drive a Saab and you may be able to associate with someone who drives a Volvo (but maybe not). A BMW driver is right out. And don’t even get started on a Renault (It’s FRENCH for God’s sake!)1. You understand when a sign clearly prohibits traffic in the residential area.Hooray for Ove!And three cheers for Frederik Backman who created the character and this wonderful story.Set in modern day Sweden, Backman’s 2012 novel (first published in Swedish as En man som heter Ove) tells the story of Ove, a 59 year old whose life seems to be escaping and getting away from him.But Ove is not just any man, Backman has drawn him as an atavistic throw back to a simpler time: when men worked for a living, had no reason to step a foot into a gym, told the truth, was loyal to a fault, and who was absolutely capable of loving one woman for his lifetime.While this is an appealing character study of the life and times of a tough old bird, this is at its heart and at its best a love story. The unlikely marriage of taciturn Ove with his colorful and vibrant wife Sonya and their enduring love is what holds this story together and makes it work.Told with warmth and humor, this is simply an excellent book."
57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464046-porshajo,Rating 4 out of 5,"I think most have read this one already. Instead of a formal review....I'll tell a short story. Why did I decide to read this one? Yeah, well this happened:I met Fredrik Backman! (Excuse the cropped photo, but I cut myself out - trying to be anon on the www and all that). So my town brought him here for a talk to promote his new book - Beartown 2. When he first began to talk I thought...he seems just a tad cranky. He sorta talked about how he didn't like people or to really talk to them. I was enjoying this talk. Then, it came time for questions and someone asked 'Did the character Ove come from someone you know? ' He said himself. And it all made sense. So I couldn't wait to get home and read this story.Ove is not an old man, but feels old as it seems things are passing him by. People are rude, people are dumb, and technology is crazy and dumb. I've read a lot of reviews on this one and people couldn't understand why Ove wasn't 80+ years old. The author indicated, then he would not be funny. Ove would be sad. He's certainly a cranky curmudgeon. He's lost his wife, and he just can't get over it and just wants to die to be with her. But some new neighbors kinda get in his way. Ove is stern and tells you how it is, he doesn't hold back the punches. It's funny.....as I know a man just LIKE Ove. My neighbor is quite the curmudgeon. Anytime I see him and ask how he is, he gruffily responds 'TERRIBLE' and I just laugh. He's the guy who tells you if you put your garbage earlier than the time indicated - not before 6 pm. He will tell you if your grass is too high, if you don't follow the borough rules. He's the un-official town Mayor (as we call him) that when new neighbors come into the town, he makes a point to meet them immediately and tell them how everyone around here keeps their places nice and he expects them to do the same. He yells at drivers who drive down the road above the posted speed limit, yells at you if park near his house....but in a second, he would be the first person there to help you when you need it. He lost his wife and is miserable without her, and yes, he has become more intolerant of people after that. I never take anything he says personally. To be honest, the place just would not be the same without him.So in the end, this story hit home with me. Ove was just...the way he was. He meant no harm to anyone, he just didn't understand the stupidity of people. Ha! I listened to this via audio and the narrator did a wonderful job. He really brought this story life. If you want a feel good story, this is a perfect read. I'm so glad that I finally read/listened to this one and look forward to my next Backman book. And oh yeah....Beartown is a trilogy! Guess I'm reading the 2nd book next!"
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-canadian-jen,Rating 4 out of 5,"Alright. This book pissed me off. It took far too much time to get some traction. I lost my buddy along the way and was tempted to join her, if not for some rave reviews. So, I persevered. And then I was no longer pissed off at Backman or Ove. I rather got a little sentimental even, by the end of it.Ove is a grumpy old man (he's only 59 but you would think he was ancient). He's an introvert who has lost his wife which translates to he has lost his life. His mission is to commit suicide to be reconciled with her. Except his mission is interrupted -several times- by others in need. And as a stand up guy, as frustrating and annoying as these outsiders are, they bring back a renewal of hope and a feeling of being needed which brings this miserable man back from the brink of darkness.Backman has created some quirky characters with a sense of community and forgiveness. This was charming but, MAN, could you have picked up the pace, Backman? This debut novel was a sentimental starter with Britt-Marie Was Here as a sputter; And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer, Backman gets better and better with Beartown being by far, his bestest.Ove, you got a small piece of me by the end, but I, like you, can be pigheaded and am only giving you a 3.5⭐️"

It wasn’t supposed to be like this. You work and pay off the mortgage and pay taxes and do what you should. You marry. For better or for worse until death do us part, wasn’t that what they agreed? Ove remembers quite clearly that it was. And she wasn’t supposed to be the first one to die. Wasn’t it bloody well understood that it was his death they were talking about? Well, wasn’t it?
And so begins Ove’s story. Left alone after more than 40 years of marriage, Ove has one final task to fulfill – commit suicide. Being that Ove has always been a man of routine and order he has everything in place. From making sure the proper drill bit has been used and a sufficient hook installed to hold his body weight to putting on his best suit to having his funeral instructions carefully tucked in said suit’s pocket to covering the floors in order to assure the realtor won’t have to deal with cleaning up dirty footprints from the first responders, Ove is ready to say goodbye to this world. Until some bloody idiot who can’t even back up a trailer not only flattens his mailbox but then proceeds to scrape the entire side of his house thus interrupting his plans. The same goes for when he tries the old tube in the tailpipe method and even when he decides to dispose of his earthly body in a not-so-tidy way. Ove just can’t be let alone to die in peace, it seems. But over time even though . . . . 
He was a man of black and white. And she was color. All the color he had. 
And . . . . 
If anyone had asked, he would have told them that he never lived before he met her. And not after either. 
Due to the pestering of the new vivacious family next door and one Annoyance Cat, things begin to shift . . . . 
She points at a figure in the middle of the drawing. Everything else on the paper is drawn in black, but the figure in the middle is a veritable explosion of color. A riot of yellow and red and blue and green and orange and purple. “You’re the funniest thing she knows. That’s why she always draws you in color.” 
Proving that . . . . 
Love is a strange thing. It takes you by surprise. 
So there you have it. There’s a good chance if you pick this book up you won’t like it all that much. That’s what happened to my mother-in-law (who gets all of the credit for me reading this one since it was her book club selection that I attempted - and failed, natch – to participate in hundreds of miles away). My explanation of her not enjoying this as much as me? She is the Sonja - not only for her husband but for our entire family. Maybe – just maybe – you need to be a bit of an Ove to fully appreciate him. And if you are, get ready for a real one-two punch right in the feels . . . . 

I finished reading this at lunch yesterday and terrified the entire office when they walked by my desk . . . . 

Yep. I cried. That doesn’t happen often. And when people asked WTF was wrong with me I couldn’t even articulate . . . . 

So like I said, I can’t tell you for certain you’ll love Ove as much as I did. You may hate it and that’s totally fine. But for me? This is going down as one of my favorite books of all time and I already ordered a hardcover in order to make sure it has a permanent spot on my bookshelves. Maybe you just have to be the recipient of the attention of an “Annoyance Cat” of you own to fully appreciate the story . . . . . 

(^^^^^That’s “Sewer Cat” – named such because he likes to hang out in the storm sewer like the nasty freak he is. He’s about eleven thousand years old, mean as a snake, second runner-up (behind Shelby’s White Trash) in the worst cat in the universe contest who sprays his disgusting pee/semen/whateveritis on my bushes to mark the front of my house as his territory and pulls the decorative landscaping away from my porch so he can sleep under it when he feels the need. He’s the epitome of a nuisance animal . . . but when he comes and knocks on the door as seen in the photo above I haul my fat butt outside pronto and give him the cat food/tuna/lunchmeat he demands. I also apologize profusely to him for my cat being a racist and not accepting the fact that black is not the only acceptable color for kittehs.)"
64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is one of those cutesy, grumpy-old-man-finds-love stories. I started off really enjoying the book, which has some amusing scenes, but I soon became disenchanted. The plot follows a predictable path, and I guessed all the beats before they happened. (Ove is a widower. He's depressed and was just forced to retire from his job. He tries several times to kill himself but he's always interrupted by some pesky new neighbors. A stray cat enters his life and, after much complaining, Ove ends up adopting it. Similar to the classic movie ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" Ove ends up finding satisfaction and meaning in being useful to his friends and neighbors, and he decides to live.) I think this is one of those novels for which you have to be in the right mood, and maybe I was a bit too grumpy while reading it.That said, I did appreciate Ove's indignation at men in white shirts who seem to be controlling and ruining everything, and how Ove took it upon himself to try and hold his neighborhood together. A civilized society has got to have standards, people! (I was amused that some of Ove's rants reminded me of comments from elderly relatives.)The novel mixes the humorous and the sentimental, and if I hadn't been so critical I would have enjoyed it more. If you like bittersweet stories about grouchy old men finding purpose, you may like this. Favorite Quotes""Ove is the sort of man who checks the status of all things by giving them a good kick.""""Every morning for the almost four decades they had lived in this house, Ove had put on the coffee percolator, using exactly the same amount of coffee as on any other morning, and then drank a cup with his wife. One measure for each cup, and one extra for the pot — no more, no less. People didn't know how to do that anymore, brew some proper coffee. In the same ways as nowadays nobody could write with a pen. Because now it was all computers and espresso machines. And where was the world going if people couldn't even write or brew a pot of coffee?"""

5 Stars!
... A stirring tale of a grumpy old sod.Ove is one of the most popular fictional characters of the 21st century I have the opportunity meeting. A brilliantly crafted character that I highly admire. Ove taught us the meaning of love, life, and the importance of having a purpose in ways that he knew. He also shared to us one of the most painful things he experienced in life; being old and lonely. A poignant, heartwarming, thought-provoking novel that I recommend to all ages. Note: This is a contemporary fiction.

""Death is a strange thing ... We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.""

And not very nice. He was never a talker and not very social either. It's the way he is, and there is a reason too. His wife Sonja died recently and he just can't take life anymore. In flashbacks we learn how he meets Sonja, how they build a life together in which he absolutely adores her. He misses her dearly and when we meet Ove he actually makes several attempts to end his life as he sees no use living on without her. However, the neighborhood prevents him to do so.... He meets a new, Iranian, family who comes to live in his neighbourhood. A pregnant woman, a clumsy husband, and two little daughters. The first encounters with the various family members are hilarious. And Ove meets a cat, who comes to live with him. And other colourful neighbors follow.... he does not want to connect with them at all, but it can't be helped. And then... the story really starts. And Ove, without wanting it, bonds... with the cat and with the family. And the other neighbors. The last pages really made me cry, really. Hit me right in the heart. (to be honest, at several points in the story, when he recounts his life with Sonja). And when a writer makes me laugh out loud and  cry... it's a five star for me. Great story & recommended. I don't think I would have found this book without Goodreads by the way. Various reviews brought me to Ove's doorstep! People had always said that Ove was 'bitter'. But he wasn't bloody bitter. He just didn't go round grinning the whole time. Did that mean one had to be treated like a criminal? Ove hardly thought so. Something inside a man goes to pieces when he has to bury the only person who ever understood him. There is no time to heal that sort of wound. "

I am enamored by books that focus on a protagonist with a life lived and a story to tell—an often dismissed group. This is such a cute, heartfelt, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny book. It's tender and has an obvious grand moral. A man called Ove is a heartwarming story of hearts that are softened and minds opened simply by letting the most unexpected people into your world. I loved it!5/5 stars!Check out my other reviews:Anxious PeopleAnd Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer"
72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/96556777-tina-loves-to-read,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a fiction book that covers a hard to read topic. I have to say it took me a little bit to get into this book. I have found that Fredrik Backman's writing style is has dry humor and some characters that it takes the whole book to feel in love with. Ove was one of those characters that took awhile to understand and love. In this book Ove spends the whole book trying to take his own life. I also think everyone around him know it, so they spend the whole book trying to stop him. In time Ove finds something to live for which I love. My Mother took her own life when I was 20 years old, and it took me a long time to be ok with what she choose. I did not get so upset while reading this book I could not finish it. I love that this put light on the this topic, and that everyone around him help this character to change his mind. I think this book was really well done and written really well. I love the characters in this book. I cannot say to much more without spoiling the book."

It's a sweet and poignant look at growing old, losing all that you love, and then finding joy and meaning again in the most unexpected ways. The main character is Ove, a curmudgeon old man who just wants to be left alone, but his neighbors have other plans. The author does such an amazing job giving the main character depth and dimension that I almost feel like he's a real person I know and love. The book starts a little slow, but I really got it into it not long after. As the story progresses, it hits all the right notes: endearing, funny, and at times sad. I'm so glad I picked this book up!"

Not what they say.”🌟 I went into this thinking that everyone was exaggerating about this book. I mean how would I love a book whose main character is a grumpy 59 year-old man. I start this & I think that I was right, people were just being dramatic about Ove, he’s just mediocre. A few hours later -since this is a fast read- my thoughts changes to I AM mediocre and Ove is the best! Gosh, the author made a good job in forcing us readers to like Ove whether we want to or not.🌟 The author is actually Swedish and this is a translation, both Fredrick & Henning Koch (Translator) did wonders regarding the writing style, I mean there are tons of quotes and beautiful sentences, I even had the urge to learn The language to appreciate the story even more.  “People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had.”🌟 This is not about the twists and plot, even when they are there and they’re good. This is mostly a character driven book that will make you relate to all the characters! I expected the ending, but who cares because I think that was the most appropriate ending for the story!🌟 And believe me this will make you go on a roller coaster of emotions; it will make you laugh, cry, think and finally, you will learn to appreciate life with Ove. So I may start recommend this to many friends from now on!  “All roads lead to something you were predestined to do.” 🌟 Finally, what type of cars do you drive guys? it may not sound relevant but that is the most important question! (Ove would be proud)"

He was a man of black and white. And she was color. All the color he had.
 
It wasn't really about cars, properly speaking. But Ove drove a Saab, after all. And Rune drove a Volvo.
 
""You don't fool me, darling,"" she said with a playful little smile and crept into his big arms. ""You're dancing on the inside, Ove, when no one's watching. And I'll always love you for that. Whether you like it or not.""
 
And then one morning, he saw her.

Ever since I had read ""Anxious People"" by the same author, I had been meaning to pick ""A Man Called Ove"". The profoundly compassionate nature of the former had set the bar too high. And boy did the latter meet the expectations! With a bang! If you are game to reading something charming and warm this is ""the"" book. A tale about a 59 year-old cantankerous, yet subtle and fascinating man named Ove. The story is wonderfully crafted, filled with subtle black humor and wry descriptions. This is the kind of book that has the ability to make the reader laugh, cry and feel sympathy for the protagonist - all at the same time. With its bittersweet and heartwarming style, this is a tale that evidently shows how love, kindness, and happiness can be found in the most unlikely places. 4.7 stars rounded to 5"

Yes, one of those moments just happened.(🙄 Maybe I should give up on reading altogether.😒 I just cannot. 😣 I just cannot continue reading this book when I reached 70 percent of this book. 😫 What the hell is wrong with me? I mean why cannot I enjoy this book. It has been one of my most anticipated reads ever since it came out.)It's so damn frustrating when you cannot finish up reading a book you thought you would enjoy. There's nothing wrong with the book that I had to stop reading it. I like the writing, the characters, the main character and everything that it had to offer. It's just that I just cannot get in sync with the book. I have tried multiple times to read this book in the past too. I thought maybe there has to be a right time. And I thought it was the right time to pick up the book again and I was so ready to read each and every word it had to offer. But no. Now that I think even if now is still not the perfect time for this book, I am so sure there will never be a perfect time for me to read this book ever. I am so indifferent to anything that's happening in the book. But I like almost everything about this book. I like how realistic the life an old man who lives alone is represented as; how grumpy he gets and how he handles every situation that comes along as an old grumpy man should.I like the romance. I like how the writing represented death, loss and grief. I like the side characters. I like reading about everything that happened in the life of Ove in the past. He reminds me of Sheldon Cooper of the Big Bang Theory. I can see some similarities between these two characters. I love the character of Sonja. She is one warm, unique memorable character. My heart still breaks for her. And everything that is going to happen to Ove. (The point is....ugh! Still so frustrating!) This is my kind of book! Did I read it too slow? No. Did I read it too fast? No. Did I expect too much from it knowing that almost everyone who read it loved it? No. For the love of sanity and embracing the unavoidable unexpected frustrating moments of my readerlife, I had to DNF this one at a little more than 70 percent of this book. Will I regret doing so?No.Because I wanted to DNF it when I was just into 30 percent of the book."

I just don’t find these type of people amusing. I really tried to finish this audio since it’s a bookclub choice. I stopped after listening to Ove’s bad moods after 6 hours. With only 3 hours to go, I abandoned the book.1 out of 5 stars"
85,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi,Rating 4 out of 5,"Such an entertaining story! I liked Ove despite his gruff exterior, and I often laughed out loud at his acerbic comments and his scheming antics. He had an opinion and he wasn’t afraid to share it! At the start of the novel, Ove had a certain mission which seemed to be constantly, and sometimes comically, foiled throughout. His disdain towards technology was especially funny at times. “Ove did not trust the Internet. He accentuated the net even though his wife nagged that you had to put the emphasis on Inter.” Ove’s wife, Sonja, was more of a people person, and I could easily imagine being friends with her. She seemed like a lovely, compassionate woman. The love they had for each other was very sweet. “Ove realized that he wanted to hear her talking about the things she loved for the rest of his life.” They really provided a balance for one another. Ove was perhaps taciturn, except when he wanted to get his often very strong opinions across! Sonja was outgoing and talkative; yet she always listened to Ove and could “hear” what was in his heart. In general, most folks did not understand or really like Ove, at least initially, and the same appeared true vice versa. “He’d been a grumpy old man since he started elementary school, they insisted.” However, Ove had a soft spot and helped others when in need. He did not like to be recognized for this and maybe that is why many did not realize his true value. I like that Ove grew to care for other characters in the novel, even those individuals who were so very different from himself. When new neighbors moved into the neighborhood, Ove was extremely skeptical, as was his nature. But these and others along with Ove banded together in a time of need and despair to help a fellow friend and neighbor. His relationship with Parveneh’s little girls was very touching. The youngest reminded me of a little Sonja, while the eldest sister had a slight edge to her, a bit like our Ove. No doubt this is why he grew fond of these two.It is difficult to say much more without giving away too many details, so I would recommend that if you like a sometimes funny and often heartwarming story, then you should try this one for a quick read. “They say the best men are born out of their faults and that they often improve later on, more than if they’d never done anything wrong.” If it doesn’t prompt you to get a Kleenex, you will in the very least wonder what it is that has caused you to note a little lump in your throat from time to time."

I thought he was rude, judgemental and a complete pain in the arse.By the end, I wanted to be his friend and hug the grumpy bastard.There were lots of similarities between Ove and myself. I think that's why I could understand him so well in this book.✅ Stubborn✅ Believing in what's right✅ Your word is your bond✅ Being pissed at life situations and letting that angry turn you into a survivor.Holy smokes, it was like looking in a mirror at times with some of the similarities.A Man Called Ove is more then a story about love. It's a story of heartbreak, letting others into your life even if you don't think you have the heart, and not judging a book by it's cover.To know Ove is to love Ove. And I do with all my heart.“Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the great motivations for living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we live harder, more obstinately, with more fury.This part fiercely resonated with me due to all the close deaths that I've had in my life.

 ღ so beautiful and very emotional i want to cry again 🫶🏻ღ ove is a very grumpy old man. He’s mean and rude sometimes heartless even. He points at people he dislike and doesn’t care if he offended you or not. He doesn’t walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time or any other time. He’s the literal definition of grumpy old man. But as you read more about him you see what made him be like this. He went through a-lot of cruel and unfair situations. He lost a-lot of precious things and people at a very young age. Spent so many years without happiness or purpose. He was simply just living until he saw her. 

 “She had a way of folding her index finger into his palm, hiding it inside. And he always felt that nothing in the world was impossible when she did that.”

 ღ ove and sonja story is one of my favorite love stories of all time. They broken me into pieces and healed me again in the best way possible. The way she made him love living and love himself by just loving him. Or how can he thinks of what her reaction would be before doing anything 🥹 she was the only one who could make him laugh guys. His love for her made me feel butterflies in my stomach. The way he’d always love to listen to her talking about books and things that she loved and made her eyes shine made me loss hope of ever finding a love like this. They’re so precious and i love them so much <333ღ The neighbors🥹 I love every single one of them. Patrick and how stupid and oblivious he is most of the time.

 beautiful quotes 

  “She often said that “all roads lead to something you were always predestined to do.” And for her, perhaps, it was something.But for Ove it was someone.”  “He never understood why she chose him. She loved only abstract things like music and books and strange words. Ove was a man entirely filled with tangible things. He liked screwdrivers and oil filters. He went through life with his hands firmly shoved into his pockets. She danced.”  “Ove had never been asked how he lived before he met her. But if anyone had asked him, he would have answered that he didn’t.” “Maybe he didn’t write her poems or serenade her with songs or come home with expensive gifts. But no other boy had gone the wrong way on the train for hours every day just because he liked sitting next to her while she spoke.” “Sorrow does strange things to living creatures.”“But sorrow is unreliable in that way. When people don’t share it there’s a good chance that it will drive them apart instead.”“Other wives get annoyed because their husbands don’t notice when they have their hair cut. When I have a haircut my husband is annoyed with me for days because I don’t look the same,”🥹🥹“We always think there’s enough time to do things with other people. Time to say things to them. And then something happens and then we stand there holding on to words like “if.”“Love is a strange thing. It takes you by surprise.”“Loving someone is like moving into a house,” Sonja used to say. “At first you fall in love with all the new things, amazed every morning that all this belongs to you, as if fearing that someone would suddenly come rushing in through the door to explain that a terrible mistake had been made, you weren’t actually supposed to live in a wonderful place like this.

Never ignore an erection.""Had I not been going through a rough spell in my life as I read this, I'm positive I'd give this a 5. It is tough when we cannot stop negatives in life from darkening our view of fiction we read.At the same time though, I'm grateful for our blessing, our magic, as humans, that great fiction naturally flows into our lives. Here, I could feel the flow and was definitely affected by this story that I think provides a great illustration of a variation on Dr. Viktor Frankl's psycho-philosophical quote, ""Those who have a 'why' to live, can bear with almost any 'how,'"" from Man's Search for Meaning. I won't get into the specifics of the story, but Ove had no ""why"" when his wife left him behind on this Earth to fend for himself. Backman's writing has a wry humor to it relating to older men of a certain ""no-nonsense"" ilk. Backman also creates a story showing the truth of having to go on living when our life's partner has been taken from us. In lesser writers' hands, the book might have fallen prey to the type of overly sentimental (read also, highly unrealistic) schmaltz that I've begun to detest in some books.* What I'm trying to say here is: deliver me a compelling and realistic story, draw me great characters and paint me the human condition, and I will likely be impacted in some profound and tender human way: I might shed a few tears as I did here, I may feel conflicted for star-crossed lovers, or feel any of the whole range of emotions I have developed over a whole lifetime of living a real life, full of happiness, sadness, love, lust, grief, regrets, anger, rage, envy, jealousy, resentments and on and on and on. I might also get subtle messages that only I might see, me and a few others in this world like me.By comparison, you should know that, as a reader, I'm pretty sharp as are most I know. We read fiction to inhabit a world of others, to feel and laugh and love. To do this, we must use our gift, in an act of faith in your abilities, of suspending disbelief, allowing us to read a ""fiction"" as if, in reality, it is happening or has happened. If you feel the urge to show us flowering prose-buds, your ability to make people cry or feel a certain way, your intellectual capacity to ""send a message,"" please, don't. Indeed, please step away from your story. If you're seen in your story, you have ruined it--our disbelief-suspension is a fragile gift in that if we get a notion, and humans are all expert bullshit-detectors, that you are ""telling"" us things to make us feel a certain way or telling us in the slightest how we SHOULD BE feeling, instead of showing us humans in the midst of the human condition, then we see you as a liar and some of us will detest you for your condescension, and the machinations of your deception. I will definitely read more from Fredrik Backman, a highly-talented writer of the former persuasion._______________*The most recent example came in a novel I read a few weeks back. It's set in southern Ohio [thank you again, southerly buckeyes, for explaining how this part of the state is solidly hillbilly country].

91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10841164-brenda-the-book-witch-at-witch-words,Rating 5 out of 5,A Man called Ove is a charming and witty story of a grumpy old man with a hidden generous heart. Who has emotional pain and comes across as angry and difficult for no good reason. With the kindness from his neighbours they start to break through the walls he has put up around himself. We see his emotional history told through alternating chapters as we learn how he came by his grumpiness honestly. Ove is a difficult character we all can relate to and we can find people like that everywhere. Ove had me laughing out loud right from the first chapter. He had me laughing at times and reaching for a tissue at other times. I love a book that has me feeling different emotions. I like how the relationship he had with his wife Sonja balanced Ove’s gloom and anger with brightness and encouragement and how Parvaneh forces her way into his life and forces him to connect with them The comment from Ove that made me laugh out loud the most was “How the heck are you supposed to have a reasonable conversation with someone who buys a BMW”. I drive a BMW and I also have driven a SAAB.A Man called Ove is a feel good story of what it is like to be human. If you have this one on your shelf to read I recommend reading it soon.
92,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne,Rating 4 out of 5,"A stellar debut novel by Fredrik Bachman. A Man Called Ove is remarkable. Funny, clever, quirky and heartbreaking.Ove is a grumpy old curmudgeon. He is difficult, mean and doesn't like anyone. He just wants to be left alone. The only thing left that he likes in the world are Saabs. Ever since his wife passed away, he keeps trying to figure out a way to be with her, but he constantly gets interrupted, by a myriad of people, he of course, doesn't like. He conducts a neighborhood watch, reports what he deems to be suspicious behavior and argues with everyone. He is most bothered by his new neighbors, Parvaneh, her husband and children. Parvaneh will not leave him alone, perhaps because she is used to people like him and needs a father figure. She pesters and pesters him, begins to ""understand"" his behavior and he warms up to her and several others as the novel progresses. Underneath his funny, gruff exterior, Ove is an old man who I fell in love with and I think you will too. Fredrik Bachman writing style is truly extraordinary. I wish I had the opportunity to meet A Man Called Ove."

All the color he had.” (I’m not crying)A grumpy yet lovable old man finds his world thrown on its side when a boisterous young family move in next door.Who knew I could have so much in common with a grumpy old man? That is my lasting impression from A Man Called Ove! I found myself nodding along with a lot of the things he got annoyed about. Rules are there for a reason, people!! If rules aren’t adhered to, anarchy will surely follow!!The chapters mostly alternate between current day and giving us some insight into Ove’s past, a past which is full of heartache, but there’s also some happy times. The parts where it discusses Ove and his wife, Sonja, were my favourites - some of those passages are simply perfection! I was reading over some before writing my review and I was almost tearing up again.The best books are those that can make you laugh and cry in equal measure, and this one really delivered on both fronts. I was constantly sending little excerpts to Matthew being like “omg this is so me!” (whilst also poking fun at him since Matthew owns a BMW and if you know Ove, you’ll understand) and when I wasn’t laughing I could feel Ove slowly making his way into my heart. By the end, I was sitting in a coffee shop trying to hold it together so as not to ruin my makeup.A Man Called Ove is a really heartwarming and touching story about community and finding your purpose, whilst touching on themes like grief and moving on. I truly loved it and cannot wait to get more Backman books! 5 stars!"
94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book started slow for me and then gradually I found myself liking it more and more. I think this is what the Author's intent was with Ove. We are instantly introduced to Ove and then the more we learn about him, the more we like him. There is more to Ove than the crabby exterior he presents to the world. As his wife once said ""he is dancing on the inside"". Ove likes order, he likes rules, he thinks things should be a certain way and yet he lets a cast of characters into his life who don't follow the rules, who fly by the seat of their pants and aren't very orderly. This is the true beauty of the book. Under his stern, tough exterior there is a sweet man who returns a wallet full of money as child, a man who takes a train the wrong way to sit next to a woman, a man who teaches a woman to drive, takes in a misfit cat, befriends a young man and becomes a surrogate grandfather. This was a moving book. At times funny, at times sad, but always good. "

Complains of rising gas and food prices. I'm from Georgia so probably worked on the railroad in their youthful days And is an avid Trump Fan. Hell, i even work with a few of them. They don't bother me that much I'm sort of like jimmy that way. Ove is a widower who is trying to end it all. But he just can't. first, it's a cat, then the annoying new Neighbours. His oldest friend / oldest enemy is dying two doors down. The neighbors are funny to me. I work if a guy from Iran, his family was forced out before the country went full Muslim when they were America allies in the region. He is very funny, full of stories, one of my favorite coworkers. the neighbor's husband is ridiculous. Alway doing a bone headed thing, like hurting himself because he can't use a ladder. Anyway, Ove just doesn't have time to kill himself with all this nonsense. so, he keeps putting it off. He then learns that the people in the white coats are coming to take his best friend/enemy. He has dealt with the white coats guys before. with his wife's injury and death. They are the government bureaucrats. my dad is always warning me about with free healthcare in Canada and Sweden. He says ""more bureaucrats, more problems"". this has a bit of a political air towards the end or was that just my dad influence about health care, I'm Not sure! Ove ends up being a member of the community, just it's weird grumpy old guy member. Good book full of emotions! can't wait to see the Tom Hanks movie wonder how the will Americanized it! "

People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the great motivations for living.""-- Fredrik Backman, A Man Called OveThis is probably a four or five star book for many readers. I get that. I'm just not very sentimental (my wife would say that is an understatement) and am usually not the biggest fan of mawkish ""Grief Fiction"". I originally wrote ""Grief Fiction"" as a joke, but the more I think about it, the more I think that might actually be a literary genre that is seeing a bit of activity lately. The last of this weird literary genre (can I call it Hallmark Fiction without being thought a prick?) I read was The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry about four years ago. Anyway, this novel explores themes of death, time, grief, family, community, duty, and cats. It was fairly predictable and suffered from a tad too much of the Jay Leno syndrome -- ""let me tell you what I just showed you so you get my joke"". There were a couple interesting characters, but many just seemed to be obligatory, feel-good types that will certainly play well with some Hollywood production company looking for another brooding, grieving roll for Jeff Bridges or Liam Neeson. Again, I can easily see how many readers will like it and to be fair I DID give it three stars so I didn't hate it. It did make me cry, but that is to be expected. I'm not sentimental, but I'm not a complete heartless bastard either."

Brilliant, clever and laugh out loud funny novel that gives us one of those special characters that you love immediately...well not a first he's kind of a prickly character but you can't help liking anyway...The simple tone of the writing complements the story wonderfully. You get why Ove is the way he is and you become all forgiving of his less than redeeming qualities. He's a sad soul and you feel deeply for the pain he is in, a person from the periphery who seems unapproachable, grumpy and inflexible. By the end you really really feel for Ove and you want him to find purpose and find some kind of happiness again. It's these type of simple character driven books that can leave a big impact after reading, I just love this books simple but powerful message about how small seemingly insignificant gestures can be life changing for all the many lonely, sad, misunderstood Ove's out there. How ultimately everyone needs to feel needed and useful for life to having meaning. I'm so glad I took heed of all the glowing reviews from fellow readers on this forum and picked up this beautiful heartwarming book! Without a doubt a firm favourite of 2017!"

I wonder if it can possibly live up to the words of praise? I’m a latecomer. Now that I finally took the chance all I can say is “You were all right”. A Man Called Ove deserves every good review and every single acclamation it has been given. Ove reminded so much of someone near and dear to my heart that they could be twins. The shared traits only increased my appreciation. My only little quibble is that Ove is described as a curmudgeonly old man. Ove is 59 in the book’s opening pages. Is 59 the new old?The Line(s)  “But we are always optimists when it comes to time. We think there will be time to do things with other people and time to say things to them, time to appeal.”The Sinker –A Man Called OveA Man Who Was OveA SaabA woman named SonjaSuits, White Shirts, Idiots & ImbecilesThe catA woman named ParvanaEnoughMore than EnoughPurposeIf you’ve read A Man Called Ove you’ll know what I’m talking about.

But any book that can make me believe that most people are basically good and decent and do the best they can with what they have, well, what can I say? I know some Ove's, and just like him, their hearts are too big.Ove's wife has just died, and he doesn't know how to go on without her. Here's how much he loved her: on their first date he ate before he took her out to dinner, so that he could get something inexpensive and let her order what she wanted in case he didn't have enough money. This was after 3 months of riding a train every day for an hour in the wrong direction just so he could sit beside her and talk. And when she died, he lost the only person who really understood him. He wanted to die as well, and came up with lots of ways to kill himself, but every time he tried, someone needed him more than he needed to die.This book is about love in all it's forms. Husbands and wives, fathers, neighbors, strangers, even mangy cats. We all need each other, we all need help, we all need to be needed and valued. Add to that some tolerance and acceptance of differences and willingness to change and you have the beginnings of a better world.Throw in a lot of humor and common sense, and you get a novel that I have to recommend to everyone. Men like Ove are a vanishing breed."

Highly recommended you do both!An absolutely wonderful read! This book has so much going for it, I relished reading every single word. Ove is a grumpy old man, but is he? He is a character filled with so much light and shade, extremely well developed character, I love Ove after reading this, I want to have a decent cup of coffee with him.Ove is unhappy generally speaking and does not hold back in sharing his dislike of rule breakers, nosy neighbours, and the men in the white shirts especially, the men who make the rules that Ove does not like. He's one of the most lovable characters and so complex.The book is funny, deep and also sad at times, I laughed out loud many times and loved seeing life from Ove's perspective. We learn about him as the book goes on as it flits back to his past and then to the present. All the characters in this book are wonderful, it's very clever writing. To me it reminds me of The Unlikely Pilgramage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce in a lot of aspects, the unveiling of the human heart through complex circumstances. I loved that book too, this one is now one of my all time favourite reads.I predict this will be a best seller and you should read it, it's so warm, funny, moving, special and clever. Go on, meet Ove and let him into your life, you won't regret it. Five stars, no doubt at all with that rating.I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."

107,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68538597-booksofradiance,Rating 4 out of 5,"Get the tissues out, folks cause you’re gonna need plenty. Ove is almost certainly the grumpiest man you will ever meet. He sees the world in black and white and thinks himself surrounded by idiots - aka the rest of the world. He is a believer in the value of routine and has such an unrelenting old-fashioned clarity of belief as well as deed, and an unswerving conviction about what the world should be. But behind Ove’s cranky exterior lies a story and a sadness. And as you read on you slowly find that he’s a man to whom fate has dealt more than his fair share of cruel blows, ultimately leaving him facing retirement as a lonely widower.This book is so so incredibly touching and deeply impactful. It’s a story of loneliness and how it slowly eats away at your soul. Above all it’s a story about unexpected friendships, generosities and how a shared life is better than a solitary one. Though melancholic and, at times, utterly bleak as the book may be, Backman artfully balances darkness and humour and delivers heartwarming novel that tug on the heart strings. "

I was sitting at my desk reading this while I should have been invoicing and I just broke down. I think the scariest part about aging is all the things you lose. This book is hilarious, heartwarming, quirky and so very sad. Ove has lost all purpose to live once his beautiful wife Sonja dies. And now he must learn to live without his other half. No one thinks about death when they are young in love. We forget that this person becomes a part of us and when a part of you leaves it is hard to function. I hope that one day I love someone enough to become their other half. Ove is a quiet good guy and he plays the role of Curmudgeon so well because he’s been betrayed. Go out read this. Then read it again. Then ugly cry about some of the characters. Then becomes friends with the children that moved next door. Then call their mom and ask for the delicious saffron rice🍛. Then ask Sonja why she loved Ove so much. Then go look up Saab cars.Then laugh at the arguments with the bleach blonde and the jerk dog. Then fall hopeless and madly in love with the bond that Ove has with Parvaneh. Then see Ove become a grandparent and a pet lover 🐈 .Then after all of that listen to it in audio and do it all over again.As always the part that ruined me 🔥🌪⚡️🌟Many years later it occurred to Sonja to ask him about all that. When Ove at last told her, she shook her head both long and hard. “So while I was sleeping you sneaked out and helped people in need . . . and mended their fences? People can say whatever they like about you, Ove. But you’re the strangest superhero I ever heard about.” I am so happy to have read this. This is book 3 by this author for me.

I found the first half of the book enjoyable but the second half just seemed to pass in a blur to be honest. There is humor in the story but the lines with reference to the Saab just got a little overdone. Having read The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry I found myself comparing characters and writing. My friends are loving this Novel and its certainly worth checking out expecially if you enjoyed 

but while I liked the character of Ove the story just didn't impress me. I do think this would make a good book club read as there is lots to discuss in this book."

He was a man of black and White.And she was color.All the color he had.
In case I don't get back with a ""full review"" you have to know that I absolutely loved this book. I loved this man called Ove. I could have spent many more hours reading about him. This book was not something I would have chosen for myself. I didn't have it on my TBR. It was a wonderful story. I quickly found myself endlessly highlighting all the moments that made me laugh, that made me sigh and those that made me cry. I enjoyed the way the story unfolded. The life that Ove was living and the life that Ove once had. Ove is a cranky man. I adored him and all his grumpiness. He was a man who needed a ray of sunshine to brightened his way. Various people became these rays of sunshine. They shrugged off his crotchety ways and brought back that little bit of happiness he needed in his life.A Man Called Ove  will definitely go on my favorites shelf. I would highly recommend this book to everyone. A definite must read!! ❤And THANK YOU  so much Mo for the recommendation!!"

Time to say things to them. And then something happens and then we stand there holding on to words like 'if'.”Some books make me tear up, some books made me cry, and some books make me wail like a baby. The man called Ove is definitely in that last category. I had trouble seeing the last couple of pages of this book I was crying so hard. did this book break my heart? Absolutely! But in the best possible way.“Ove had never been asked how he lived before he met her. But if anyone had asked him, he would have answered that he didn’t.”​But don't be fooled, Ove is not the most likable character ever. If anything he is very much on the opposite spectrum. He is set in his ways, he is extremely grumpy and unsociable, and other people to him are either idiots or nuisance, but mostly just idiots. Now, I love characters like that. Love them! Quirky, weird, unsociable - you name it, I'm here for it. But even for me Ove was hard to handle at times. He wanted to be right even if he was wrong, and sometimes I just wanted to smack him. And no, there wasn't a magical transformation - Ove didn't become a social butterfly, or a lovable old man - he stayed himself, truly and unapologetically himself, just better. And I absolutely loved that. “He was a man of black and white. And she was color. All the color he had.”I don't remember how I stumbled upon this book on Goodreads, but I'm so happy that I did, because now I want to read more books by Fredrik Backman, even more so because he is a foreign author. And one of my 2018 resolutions is to read more from non-american authors. The translation was pretty good for it didn't feel like a translated book, it was smooth and flowy, albeit a bit dry, but I think that is the Backman's style. The thing that surprised me the most, and probably produced the most of the tears, was how at the end I realized that Parvaneh needed him as much as he needed her. This book was just so beautiful on so many levels. Okay, just thinking about it makes me tear up, damn you Backman and your emotional writing! I absolutely recommend The man called Ove - the book is full of emotions and life lessons. It dives deep into the nature of loss and grief and how we, as humans try to deal with it, each in out own ways. ___________________________________________________I didn't know this was by a foreign author - this just jumped to the top of my TBR because of that, as one of my 2018 reading resolutions is to read more books by foreign authors.

And a true gem.I had a wonderful time listening to the audiobook, and my love for all things cantankerous and quirky found a new favorite character to adore. OVE was the epitome of an old, cranky, and monosyllabic man. He drew me in with his personality, and his way of interacting with people he didn't really want to interact with. It added to the overall enjoyment that deep down he had a warm and caring heart.The cast of characters were phenomenal. A patchwork of interesting and charismatic characters that drew Ove out and gave him a reason to live again. And exactly these growing relationships, with characters that annoyed him so much at the beginning, was what made this book so absolutely endearing.I can only recommend this book to anyone. It was uplifting, touching, and heartwarming. A MUST READ and one of my most favorite books in a long time."

119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1128612-pattymacdotcomma,Rating 5 out of 5,"10★s - if only that were possible.Just listen to this bit! This is the kind of book that I bet readers have used up a whole slew of highlighters on. It’s hilarious and melancholy, sometimes all at the same time, and you look around for someone to interrupt and share it with saying, “Just listen to this bit...” This remarkable story of a cranky old bugger has shot to the top of my favourites list. I recognise people I know in Ove (I’m related to some – oops!), and I recognise the people who care about him and who annoy him. Again, sometimes all at the same time. His widower father worked for the railways and was the (very) strong, silent type. “The palms of his hands looked like someone had carved into leather with knives, and the wrinkles in his face were so deep that when he exerted himself the sweat was channelled through them down to his chest.” At 16, Ove was orphaned, and he took over his father’s job at the railways. He worked hard, said little, lived simply and uneventfully until suddenly, one morning, he came off his shift “and caught sight of her. With those red shoes and the gold brooch and all her burnished brown hair. And that laughter of hers which, for the rest of his life, would make him feel as if someone was running around barefoot on the inside of his breast.”Sonja. The love of his life. Today, he is an old man, determined to make the neighbours obey the rules of the Residents Association, determined to win his battles against “the white shirts” in bureaucracy, and determined to ensure his neighbourhood is safe, by prowling around early mornings and after dark to check doors, gates, and locks.He is a determined man. And he is definitely not politically correct. He is also determined to finish his next project, but he is constantly interrupted by a very pregnant Iranian new neighbour, her blond husband (the Lanky One) and their 2 little girls. He meets them when he sees the Lanky One backing a trailer over his flower bed while the wife shouts: “ ‘I said RIGHT! But you carried on reversing to the LEFT! You don’t listen! You never LISTEN!’After that, she immerses herself in half a minute’s worth of haranguing in what Ove can only assume to be a display of the complex vocabulary of Arabic cursing. The husband just nods back at her with an indescribably harmonious smile. The sort of smile that makes decent folk want to slap Buddhist monks in the face, Ove thinks to himself.”Later, Parvaneh, the wife, brings him biscuits. “  ‘Right. Arabian biscuits. Worth having, are they?’ he mutters.‘Persian,’ she corrects.‘What?’‘Persian, not Arabian. I’m from Iran—you know, where they speak Farsi?’ she explains.‘Farcical? That’s the least you could say,’ Ove agrees.”Nobody seems to understand boundaries the way Ove does. They just barge in and demand that he reply to polite questions and enjoy the saffron rice they take over for his dinner.Ove is a doer, not a talker. He can fix anything, which everyone knows. He loves only Saabs, tolerates Volvos, drops his best friend who, after years of owning Volvos, bought a BMW! Ignorant traitor!He doesn’t understand people, and when we see them through his eyes, we see what he means. Here’s the ticket-seller at the train station:“The slightly porky man on the other side of the Plexiglas has backcombed hair and arms covered in tattoos. As if it isn’t enough to look like someone has slapped a pack of margarine over his head, he has to cover himself in doodles as well. There’s not even a proper motif, as far as Ove can see, just a lot of patterns. Is that something an adult person in a healthy state of mind would consent to? Going about with his arms looking like a pair of pyjamas?”See what I mean? It’s hard not to want to keep quoting things. A remarkable, thought-provoking book. Highly recommended to enjoy with friends."
120,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121676981-cj,Rating 5 out of 5,"My first five star read of 2024! That didn’t take too long.I think this story can be a bit silly at times, and as a character, Ove can at times come off as cartoonish. But to then be taken to this dark place within his mind where all of his grief and loneliness attacks him for the life he feels like he no longer has. It’s such an unexpected shift from the story I thought I was picking up, and I thank Fredrik Backman for taking this story in the direction that he did. It’s really the kind of novel that will make you laugh through your tears. It’ll hit you in all the best spots, and you’ll never forget what makes this grumpy old man so special."
121,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte,Rating 5 out of 5,"""How can you reason with a man who bought a BMW?"", Ove thought. How can you take an Audi driver seriously! Hyundai is despicable, Toyota a tad more tolerant (although God helps them anyway), but a Renault - French of all things, will ruin any idea of friendship. When Rune forsakes Volvo for a BMW, a forty-year bond of friendship with Ove became null and void. In this world where one became outdated before one's time was up, fifty-nine-year-old Ove, a jobless widower, who neither had any next-of-kin nor children, had trouble accepting Rune, his best friend's betrayal.After his wife, Sonja, passed away, six months ago, he chummed up with Old Nic, The Grim Reaper, to take him to her. It was not enough for him to visit her grave and talk to her. After all, he had to explain his intentions and ask for her support and understanding for his promise to join her, the only person who ever understood him. Like she understood all the borderline figures, moving in the shadowy peripheries of normalcy. She not only understood them, she taught them, Shakespeare, with all her heart and soul. They proved her right and the world wrong.  “He was a man of black and white. And she was color. All the color he had.”  In his white and grey world of the snowy Swedish winter, Ove brought her flowers from the florist each week. He brought her color back. Her colors that he could not live without.He drives a Saab. He's the kind of man who points at people he doesn't like the look of, as if they were burglars, and his forefinger a policeman's torch; he dislikes shop assistants who drive Japanese cars; he met a stray cat at exactly five minutes before six in the morning,  The cat instantly disliked Ove exceedingly. The feeling was very much reciprocated.Ove stomped forward. The cat stood up. Ove stopped. They stood there measuring up to each other for a few moments, like two potential troublemakers in a small-town bar. Ove considered throwing one of his clogs at it. The cat looked as if it regretted not bringing its own clogs to lob back.""Pest,"" he thought, glancing at his watch. Two minutes to six. Time to get going or the bloody cat would have succeeded in delaying the entire inspection. Fine state of affairs that would be."" His neighbors. Idiots, the whole lot of them. Anders: - the snake, the beard-stubbed poser, the neighbor across the street who drives an Audi. Self-employed people and other idiots all drive Audis;
“Ove glares out of the window. The poser is jogging. Not that Ove is provoked by jogging. Not at all. Ove couldn’t give a damn about people jogging. What he can’t understand is why they have to make such a big thing of it. With those smug smiles on their faces, as if they were out there curing pulmonary emphysema. Either they walk fast or they run slowly, that’s what joggers do. It’s a forty-year-old man’s way of telling the world that he can’t do anything right. Is it really necessary to dress up as a fourteen-year-old Romanian gymnast to be able to do it? Or the Olympic tobogganing team? Just because one shuffles aimlessly around the block for three-quarters of an hour?” 
Ander's girlfriend: The Blonde Weed - tottering round the lanes like an inebriated panda on heels as long as box spanners, with clown-paint all over her face and sunglasses so big that one can't tell whether they're a pair of glasses or a kind of helmet.""The Lanky One who just moved in with his young family;The Little Foreign Woman(Parveneh) - who is either very pregnant or suffering from what Ove would categorize as selective obesity.The overweight, quarter-tonner, twin-sized, lunchbox-eater, young neighbor - with his long feminine hair and his strange t-shirts, who could attack a bowl of crisps from all directions at once, and probably test bacon for a living;The waste-of-oxygen whelp - with his over-sized training shoes and his too-tight jeans; with his friend -the bum-fluffed face with blackheads and hair that looks like he was pulled up by someone saving him from drowning in a barrel.The communists at the end of the street who pushed through garbage sorting in the Residents' Association meeting;Once bitten, twice shy was Ove (pronounced Oo-veh)'s mantra in life. Conned, ripped-off, especially by the men in white, and double-crossed, he learned too many lessons early in life to love human beings. They gave him no reason to smile.“People said he was bitter. Maybe they were right. He’d never reflected much on it. People also called him antisocial. Ove assumed this meant he wasn’t overly keen on people. And in this instance, he could totally agree with them. More often than not people were out of their minds.”But really, all he wanted to do was die peacefully. Is that too much to ask? 
He has prepared everything. He has paid the undertakers and agreed his place in the churchyard next to her. He's called the lawyers and written a letter with clear instructions and put it in an envelope with all his important receipts, the deeds of the house, and the service history of the Saab. He put this envelope in the inside pocket of his jacket. He's paid all his bills. He has no loans and no debts, so no one will have to clear up anything after him. He's even washed up his coffee cup and canceled the newspaper subscription. He is ready.
The trouble is that he just cannot avoid his nosy, intrusive, interfering, attention-seeking, idiotic neighbors, who simply do not understand the necessity of order, discipline, routine, good old manual labor, and privacy! They need ladders, tools, someone to bleed their radiators, and god-only-knows-what else! Ove is the Swedish version of the main characters in movies such as: Grumpy Old Men with Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon, Jack Nicholson(particularly in  'As Good As It Gets'), Clint Eastwood (""Go ahead, make my day!"" in Southern Impact) - they're all chopped from the same wood. Then there are his literary buddies:The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared by Jonas JonassonThe Book of Ebenezer Le Page by G.B. EdwardsMajor Pettigrew's Last Stand by Helen SimonsonEDITI forgot about these two books:The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry by Gabrielle ZevinThe Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry (Harold Fry #1) by Rachel Joyce.(I want to remember these books. Perhaps should categorize them in their own tag) - END OF EDIT.I started out laughing out loud and ended up crying my eyes out. I started out annoyed with this man and ended up being in love with him.One of the best books to read this year for sure!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

Ove stayed there with her hand in his for several hours. Until the hospital staff entered the room with warm voices and careful movements, explaining that they had to take her body away. Ove rose from his chair, nodded and went to the undertakers to take care of the documentation. On the Sunday she was buried. On the Monday, he went to work. But if anyone had asked, he would have told them that he never lived before he met her. And not after, either.
As I slowly and effortlessly slid between the sheets, I became engulfed and absorbed in the world of a miserable, curmudgeonly fifty-nine year old Swedish man called Ove and what an unexpected individual did he turn out to be.The plot is simple: man loves woman, marries her, is more than happy with this life and then she dies and life ceases to exist for Ove but then there is always something serendipitous that is going to happen and from quite an unexpected source. For then all the neighbours come into the mix…Flashbacks of Ove’s life with his wife Sonja gently flow throughout this work. She was colour, particularly red. Ove was black and white. She was day whereas he was night. She was always late. He was the opposite and a truly organized and functional man. And yet, their marriage worked as the equilibrium was maintained between them.Her death made him determined that he had to join her and various mishaps with suicide added the tragicomedy element to this wonderful book. The spanner in the works proves to be Pananeh. A pregnant, foreign woman and a new neighbour. She’s more or less like a guardian angel and always manages to appear whenever something awful is going to happen to Ove or does in fact happen. Life is indeed a curious thing.I’m so taken with this book that it is impossible to write a review on it. I’ve made notes galore. All I can say is that I’m so pleased that I came across this work and read it.It’s absolutely super and that’s all there is to it."

Oh dear, this book should come with a warning label or a box of tissues because as silly as I felt, I was crying my face off at least three times when reading it. And I am NOT a crier. Or at least I wasn’t until now. I had no choice in the matter. I fell in love with Ove and his neighbour Parvaneh and was so invested that I ended up buried deep in all the emotions the story heaps upon them.Everyone knows someone like Ove: a grumpy, (possibly) old grouch who others assume is just mean and miserable by nature. This sour curmudgeon may be your grandpa or your aunt, a teacher or a neighbour, but they slog about in ill-temper, with a resting bitch face that could frighten a prison guard. With a busy schedule and the fear of the unknown providing a buffer, one’s inclination is self-preservation, and accordingly, you may opt to leave them alone to their misery. What both Ove’s wife Sonja and Parvaneh teach us is that our assumptions can be disastrously wrong. I found many similarities between their two personalities and how they related to Ove. His misunderstood and surly nature is a protective and well-honed coping mechanism, one he crafted as a lonely soul trudging through the depths of disappointment and sadness that life dragged him through. He has lived through harsh times, in that he has suffered many familial losses, heartache, and disappointment. A man from the old school, his steadfast principles are to work hard, be honest, and do the right thing, no matter what. Well, that and driving a Saab!'He believed so strongly in things: justice and fair play and hard work and a world where right just had to be right.'The untimely death of his virtuous father, rendering him an orphan in his teens, left him holding firmly to these inherited dogmas and, consequently, vulnerable and plagued with naivety.The old adage no good deed goes unpunished ran through my mind often as he went it alone and learned about the hard lessons of life, suffering those who would take advantage of his righteous ways. Backman’s twisting of the past with the present gives us a clear view of the hardening that sets over Ove as trauma and tragedy mould him into the cantankerous sourpuss his neighbours know him to be. ‘He knew very well that some people thought he was nothing but a grumpy old sod without any faith in people. But, to put it bluntly, that was because people had never given him reason to see it another way.‘'Because a time comes in every man's life when he decides what sort of man he's going to be: the kind who lets other people walk all over him, or not.'As destiny would have it, another of Ove’s unfortunate setbacks was a heart condition that kept him from serving in the Military, that routine-laden world comprised of rules and purpose, where he felt he could belong. ‘Military personnel wore uniforms and followed orders. All knew what they were doing. All had a function. Things had a place. Ove felt he could actually be good as a soldier. In fact, as he went down the stairs to have his obligatory medical examination, he felt lighter in his heart than he had for many years. As if he had been given a sudden purpose. A goal. Something to be.’The best bit of fortune he ever received and the highlight of his days was meeting his effervescent bride-to-be, Sonja, on a passenger train one fateful day.Sonja is life and love in colour, nurturing Ove and her wayward students with smiles of confidence and hope. She sees her husband for who he really is underneath the gruffness and the black and white. The love and appreciation they share for each other are the good stuff that made me feel the painful parts more keenly. ‘And when one of her girlfriends asked why she loved him she answered that most men ran away from an inferno. But men like Ove ran into it.’'People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had.'‘Ove had never been asked how he lived before he met her. But if anyone had asked him, he would have answered that he didn’t.’With the passage of time and circumstance, Ove struggles with what remained of his life, as he lacks purpose and connection. Thanks to his job pushing him into early retirement and nothing or no one to live for, what was left?‘And Ove didn’t know exactly when he became so quiet. He’d always been taciturn but this was something quite different. Maybe he had started talking more inside his own head. Maybe he was going insane (he did wonder sometimes). It was as if he didn’t want other people to talk to him, he was afraid that their chattering voices would drown out the memory of her voice.’Queue Parvaneh and her cacophonous clan moving in across the way. Between breaking condo rules, asking for help, and showing up unannounced with home-cooked meals, they shove their way into the void of Ove’s darkened heart, and not a moment too soon. He’d had enough of the struggle to carry on and had been plotting his mortal exit, but thanks to the interruptions of his overly involved neighbours, he would be halted sometimes seconds before he was successful. The juxtaposition of the grumpy older man alongside the vivacious young mother was a pleasure to read. I could feel my spirits lifting with Ove’s as he started to connect with Parvaneh’s daughters, conspire to tease her dopey husband, and grow stronger from the purpose he again felt in his existence. It was heartwarming to watch the new seasons of Ove’s life as he blossomed again into a neighbour that put himself out for others, caring enough to do so. His rigidity began to soften while going with the flow of the new relationships being cultivated, his story unfurling into acceptance and light. This book was an emotional rollercoaster, completely worth the ride. Themes of friendship, purpose, and connection had me mournfully reflective of what the lack of these things means to our society during lockdowns and the isolation of this pandemic. How many Ove’s needing a Parvaneh can’t meet her because of this mess, and what can they do to persevere until things get back to normal? Community is the key to healing from loss and loneliness. Being a part of a group provides a sense of purpose and a feeling that people care whether you live or die. Sometimes that same community is the one thing that will prevent someone from succumbing to their struggle.Don’t give up on yourself or your neighbour; be brave, make time, keep smiling, and let the Ove in your life have a second chance.

126,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Hit my reading goal for the year, and I wanted to highlight this book in particular, because it's one of only two books that I gave a full five stars to, and this one was probably my favorite. If you get the chance, definitely check it out. This is my original review.***
I have a story to tell you.
 It’s a little long, but I really feel like I need to share this.As I sit here writing this review, I’m honestly not sure why the book I just read affected me so much. I don't normally read a lot of regular contemporary fiction - I keep it mostly to fantasy and sci-fi. But this book caught my attention. It made me think - more than any other book has made me think in a very long time, and it reminded me of something I learned over a year ago that has really stuck with me.I work as an insurance salesman at a State Farm agency in Queens, NY. My job being the kind of job that it is, I deal with hundreds of people a week, from sales calls, to service calls, to whatever else in between. One of the things I hate the most about my job is dealing with angry customers, but that kind of comes with the territory. On this one particular day, an elderly woman (she looked to be in her early seventies) walked into the office, clearly upset. She had a Russian accent that made it a little hard for me to understand everything she was saying, but she still spoke excellent English. And when I say she was upset, I mean she was livid – like REALLY livid. She DEMANDED that I open her and her husband’s car policy, because supposedly we raised her rates unjustly, and she said that I had better help her fix it or else she was going to cancel her policy right then and there. “I am an elderly woman!” she said. “I barely even drive my car, and I’ve never had an accident in my life!”I was already frustrated, because *I* was not the one who raised her rates, I just happened to work for the insurance company that did. I felt like she was being extremely rude to me. I couldn’t understand for the life of me why somebody would walk into an office and think that they had the right to treat somebody the way that she was treating me. And in any case, she was paying probably half of what the average person in Queens pays for their car insurance, and in my mind, she shouldn’t be complaining.I’m not even saying this in a prideful way, but like… I try to be a nice person. I’ve always felt like I was a reasonably nice guy, even to people who didn’t particularly like me. For whatever reason though, on that particular day, I’m ashamed to admit that I responded to her by being rude in return. I was having a bad day as it was, and I was stressed trying to plan my wedding, and I didn’t feel like I deserved her poor treatment and accusations. I ignored all of her claims, quickly told her that it was out of my hands, and explained there was nothing I could do. I made it as clear as possible that I could not help her. Anything, I thought, to get this woman away from my desk. I was shocked to see that she gave up almost immediately. When people are upset about their price, they almost never quit right away, but she dropped it almost before the words were even out of my mouth. “Well, alright,” she said. “That’s not what I came in here for, anyways.”She started to reach into her bag, and it looked like she was removing some kind of document. I assumed it was something typical, like a driving course certificate or an inspection form, because I deal with that stuff literally all the time. She placed the document on my desk, and turned to the side, almost like she didn’t even want to look at me. She seemed anxious, all of a sudden. I was confused at this point, so I looked down at the piece of paper she put on my desk. It was a death certificate. She had come to remove her husband from the policy. He died roughly two months ago. My heart sank, and I looked up. She was sitting sideways on the chair, looking away from me; but I could already see there were tears in her eyes, even as she started to speak again. “We were together for almost 40 years,” she said, and her voice was shaking. “They send so much mail… I just need to get his name off of it.” And a single tear started to fall down her cheek, her eyes filled with sadness, where before I could only see anger and rage. The woman who I could only see as a problem to get rid of, all of a sudden, became human right in front of me. And I didn’t know what to do.“I am so sorry,” I said, even though it felt cheap after the exchange that we just had. I didn’t know what to say. In that moment, I swear to you, it was like God brought directly to the surface of my mind every time I had been rude, or insulting, or even impolite to somebody who I thought was bothering me. And he reminded me that everybody has a story. Everybody has a hundred things that make them broken, in little ways, and probably a handful of things that have broken them in big ones. This woman in front of me was dealing with so much grief, and the only thing that I could think about was that 
I
 was being mistreated, 
I
 was being insulted, 
I
 did not deserve her harsh words. And I realized how self-centered I was. It made me want to cry, because that is not who I ever wanted to be. 
Why mention this?
 This book tells the story of a man we’ve all met. He is the guy giving you a hard time at your retail job. The man who is so strict and on top of the rules it’s infuriating. He is the old man next door that scares everybody in the neighborhood. A man who most of us are usually tempted to disregard. A man that most of us see as a problem. He is the woman who walked into my job, raging about the price of her insurance. And he is the man who has a story. 
A story that most of us will probably never take the time to know.
More than anything, to me, this book was a powerful reminder that everybody we come in contact with is more than meets the eye. Even more than this, 
it reminded me that we have the power to truly make a difference in the lives of the people who we only ever see as a problem.
 And that’s something we can never take for grantedAnd wow I loved it. Powerful story. Beautiful writing. There are some books that are just more than books to me, and this is one of them. A lifelong favorite, for sure. Read it if you can =].***Friends.... Read. This. Book. Easily in my top ten favorites of all time. It's been sitting in my Audible library for over a year, so I decided to just pick it up, and I can't even tell you how pleasantly surprised I was. I have so much to say and write. I'll post a full review tomorrow."
127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin,Rating 5 out of 5," Ove is fifty nine. He drives a Saab. He's the kind of man who points at people he doesn't like the look of,as if they were burglars and his forefinger a policeman's torch.   Everyone has an Ove in their life. A man that society has judged to be better off alone, but someone that we all need. Ove is definitely an irresistible character and I couldn't help but feel that this book was incredibly relevant. It reminds me how important it is to reach out and help one another. Despite the initial first impressions that we might have.  Another part of the story I loved was Ove's reflection on his life with his wife,Sonja. I guess it reminded me of my grandparents. Like Ove and Sonja, they lived in a time when it wasn't the number of romantic gestures that said ""I love you"", but all the things done day in and day out that showed your love. Okay,I might be projecting a bit, but it was truly a beautiful book. I would DEFINITELY recommend this book.  Her friends couldn't see why she woke up every morning and voluntarily decided to share the whole day with him. He couldn't either.He built her a bookshelf and she filled it with books by people who wrote page after page about their feelings. Ove understood things he could see and touch.Cement and concrete. Glass and steel.Tools. Things one could figure out. He understood right angles and clear instruction manuals. Assembly models and drawing. Things one could draw on paper. He was a man of black and white. And she was colour. All the colour he had. "
128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84916113-daisy-mae,Rating 3 out of 5,"“And time is a curious thing. Most of us only live for the time that lies right ahead of us. A few days, weeks, years. One of the most painful moments in a person's life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead. And when time no longer lies ahead of one, other things have to be lived for. Memories, perhaps.” A man called Ove is the story of a lifetime, told from the perspective of a man that has reached the last segment of it. Fort this reason, it's sweet and sour, happy and sad, scary, disappointing and exciting. Just like every human life. The main character, Ove, has recently lost his wife, and struggles to go on without her because, by own words:“Ove had never been asked how he lived before he met her. But if anyone had asked him, he would have answered that he didn’t.”Theirs was such a beautiful love story! Forget Edward and Bella, I want a love like Ove and Sonja!😍 I have to say that, even though I am not a romance reader at all, my favourite parts of the book (a part from Ove's accidental humour that just cracks me up) where the ones about Ove and Sonja. I loved Sonja's character and her peculiar strength, so different from Ove's one but so powerful at the same time. My main issue with this book, is that I found it a little to ""cartoonish"", and way less realistic than I thought it would be. I understand that some parody elements were for the sake of laughing, and that some characters and reactions were stretched to amuse the reader; but I think this book would have been more interesting for me if Ove and his friends-enemies were more life-like, more unique and less cliché (the bossy pregnant lady, the blonde with the Chihuahua, even Ove as the grumpy old man). Finally, I must admit that I found some parts of this book rather boring: I understand the author's aim was to tell us the life story of a man through flashbacks of memories of his early years, and I liked the fact that those memories were usually put as ""explanations"" for his current pet peeves and apparently crazy behaviours; but some events were of little to no interest for me (like the sections about house-building). This is a totally personal opinion, of course.I liked the book alright; I don't read contemporary as much as I would like too, and though it's not my favourite genre I appreciate a good slice of life, when the character is worth it. And Ove was definitely worth it! If he was my neighbour, I wouldn't say no to tea and a chat with him. I doubt he would accept though! Ahah! "
129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36199787-jim,Rating 5 out of 5,"I don't rate books at 5 stars too often. According to Goodreads 5 stars means ""it was amazing"" and to me 5 stars should be the exception. Well this book is both. Rarely have I read a book where the author has created such a memorable character. Ove is a 59 year old curmudgeon. In Ove's world right is right, wrong is wrong, rules are rules, and signs are to be obeyed.Ove sees things in black and white. His wife saw things in color but she died about 4 years ago and all the color in Ove's world is gone. Now he has lost his job because his employer decided it would be nice for him to relax and take it easy at his age. He has decided that a world without Sonja is not worth living and to join her in the afterlife. But his plans to end his life are constantly interrupted. First there is a new couple that move in next door. Parvaneh and Patrick and their two young daughters. Patrick can't even back up a trailer without running over Ove's mailbox despite Parvaneh's directions. Unbelievable that a man Patrick's age can't back up a trailer. Ove must do it himself. This is just the first of many hilarious interactions with his new neighbors. Further attempts to join Sonja are just as unsuccessful. Whether it is helping other neighbors or saving the life of another man Ove's plans are constantly being interrupted.We also meet a cat who is brought into Ove's world. Sonja loved cats. Ove doesn't. Or so he would tell you. Early on it would appear that Ove would like to throw one of his clogs at the cat and that the cat wished it wore clogs too so it could throw one at Ove. But Ove and the cat appear to have an understanding and maybe a little in common. At times I could not help but laugh as I pictured the two of them.Throughout the story people enter Ove's life. All uninvited. At times you will cry but mostly you will laugh. This is one of the most delightful and feelgood stories that I have read in a long time. I think anyone who has met Ove can't help but love the guy. Strongly recommend reading this book. Maybe my favorite of the year."
130,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ove is a grumpy, older man, defined as such because he lives his life by a code that’s pretty black and white and inflexible. His point of view has also been shaped by a system that’s often been cruel and unfair and has let him down at critical times in his life. But, there is one person who’s never disappointed him and that’s his wife, Sonja. Unfortunately, she recently died after 40 years of marriage and now he’s also forced into retirement. When a new family moves in next door, they disrupt Ove’s life in a way that has a profound impact. I was utterly taken with the curmudgeonly Ove from the start. Many other reviewers were thrown by his age (59), thinking he was much older. But I have Oves in my life and they didn’t suddenly arrive grumpy when they became of that age. It was progressive and they had wives like Sonja to smooth out those edges when out in the world. I don’t think it was happenstance that a street-savvy cat, a family with young children and messy lives, a former friend-turned-adversary now in need, and two young men who are misfits in the world all collide to redefine Ove’s world. Underneath the humor (there are some truly hysterical moments) lies a lot of sadness, loneliness and heartbreak that Ove has masked by being difficult. The author masterfully juxtaposes backstory into the present at just the right moments, giving Ove layers and definition. So many of my friends have read this story and encouraged me to add it to my shelf. I’m so happy I heeded their advice as I found it spiritually uplifting. And, it comes at the right time for me personally. I opted for the audio and that really worked for me though I was expecting a Swedish narrator. I highly recommend this story to those who like exploring what lies beyond a character you think you recognize and know. "

132,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Life is a curious thing.""Man- I have no words other than how magnificent this book is. I am sure as fuck that I fell in love with a beautiful, fluff, slice of life fiction story like this. God- the way this book makes me feel a whole new different feelings at once. Let's review the technical things first, shall we? the writing: as I always said, this is not my usual go-to writing. It's not that I dislike it, but it was clear to me that different POVs have different effect on readers and I prefer 1st person POV rather than 3rd person POV. Usually because how I get to be the character and it connects and relates me better to the character than 3rd person POV. But I did suspect that it would be on 3rd POV and I supposed I could just continue reading it since it wasn't my biggest turn off in reading. Then I discovered there were not much conversation and mostly it was recounting Ove's whole life (also I have a bizarre urge to crochet while reading which you can't), so I switched to audiobook in the middle! God, I didn't regret it at all and I liked this even better because it felt so different than reading. the plot: I must admit that I didn't go into this blindly because I've been setting my eyes on this book since last year and I made it included in my priority tbr list this year. So I read the synopsis but it was months ago and all I knew that this is a book about an old curmudgeon man that slowly found another family. It is about that but I was surprised when I found out that it was heavily laced with heavy topic and I swear I didn't see that coming! It caught me off guard but I got even more interested in what will happen next and gosh I loved it so much!The plot moved back and forth with Ove's life, I can't say this is a dual timeline book but I can say this is more like a recount about Ove's life overall. I loved it. I loved that even though it's heavily laced with a lot of heavy topics, but the mood and vibe that was going on in the book weren't heavy at all! It was even funny and lighthearted and I think it helped readers to enjoy the book without being depressed even more. I mean Ove and his whole life were already depressing enough so there was no need for the reader to be depress with him.the characters: perfect. Just perfect. Each has their own unique quirks and beautiful also heartwarming background. Each was basically so living and it was just pure perfection. I also loved that each of them has their own conflicts and their own endings which all of them ended happily. Like you'll shed in tears reading the last chapters. Overall, this is a magnificent and perfect book and I loved it so much. So happy that I could add another book into my favorite shelf. It's a sad, cute, funny, heartwarming, and heartbreaking book that could make you feel a thousand different layers of feelings at once. I recommend this to everyone.Now I want to say one thing that I caught the most while reading this. When I finished it there was a huge urge inside of me to be all the colors in the world to my beloved or at least try to be (especially now that I'm one step closer to be someone's wife and I'm highkey excited for that). 
""People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had.""
But in honesty I do hope everyone get to be this to someone in this universe 💖There was no way more beautiful in closing this review than sharing some of the beautiful things from the book.""He was a man of black and white. And she was color. All the color he had.""""She often said that “all roads lead to something you were always predestined to do.” And for her, perhaps, it was something. But for Ove it was someone.""""And now she stood outside the station with his flowers pressed happily to her breast, in that red cardigan of hers, making the rest of the world look as if it were made in grayscale.""""“You have to love me twice as much now,” she said.And then Ove lied to her for the second—and last—time: he said that he would. Even though he knew it wasn’t possible for him to love her any more than he already did.""""Every human being needs to know what she’s fighting for. That was what they said. And she fought for what was good. For the children she never had. And Ove fought for her. Because that was the only thing in this world he really knew.""""“What sort of love is it if you hand someone over when it gets difficult?”""It's giving me the urge to take care an old man but mine died almost two years ago😭💔 go ahead and hug your father right now guys😭😭Edit: JUST FINISHED WATCHING THE US VERSION MOVIES. AND HOLY FUCKING SHIT, TOM HANKS WAS SO FUCKING AWESOME AND IT WAS A TEARJERKER MOVIES!!!! I FUCKING LOVE IT- 😭😭😭😭😭😭"
133,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5841822-jackie-ullerich,Rating 5 out of 5,"I absolutely loved A Man Called Ove!Ove is quite the character: a disgruntled curmudgeon with lots of quirks, and I fell in love with him. Because of Ove, I found this novel to be just a little bit weird, a little bit off, in the best way, yet so relatable. Readers will travel through a whole spectrum of emotions. There were heartbreaking scenes and scenes that were so funny that I burst out laughing. For whatever it's worth, this novel was by far the most humorous book I've ever read. However, since I usually read mysteries and thrillers, that might not be saying much?!I must mention the cat. (Confession, I'm a dog lover. Cat lovers, don't hate me, please?!) But I loved this cat. Without a doubt, this cat is quite the character, and some of those scenes were not only brilliantly written, but memorable.Another aspect of this novel that captivated me was Ove's growth. Yes, he's gruff, but his inner development along with the selfless acts he does for others, deeply touched me.For my Goodreads friends who read mostly mysteries and thrillers, highly consider adding A Man Called Ove to your list of books to check out. It's worth it and an excellent way to clear the mental ""palette""! For anyone who loves character-driven novels, this is a must read."
134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75157-carol,Rating 1 out of 5,"I wanted so much to like this book after reading all the great reviews. It sounded like just the kind of novel that I could really spend a few enjoyable days with. I read several chapters, but was so annoyed with this man's constant grumbling about EVERYTHING that I put it down for a couple days before trying again. Alas, it remained the same - grumbling, grouching, mean-spirited, hateful, know-it-all and unpleasant - so I stopped again.I read another book and was ready to take it and this one back to the library but read some more wonderful reviews so thought I should try again. ""I must be missing something, or maybe I just have to read further."" When he started throwing shovefuls of snow at the stray cat, I had had enough. I just can't understand how so many people thought this man was funny, endearing, and cute. Maybe he became wonderful on the page after I stopped reading, but I could not wait for it any longer! Even if he did, I would always remember how awful he was in the beginning.I quit.P.S. I also grew weary of the overuse of his name. "
135,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12656534-zoeytron,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ove is a man of absolutes. Right is right, wrong is wrong, and never the twain shall meet. He is the epitome of a grumpy old man even though he isn't really all that old. He follows the rules, doesn't waste food, and has very strong feelings about the make of car that one drives. Ove's tailfeathers are in a perpetual snarl over people who no longer drink 'real coffee', and becomes apoplectic over 'brain-dead phone-texting teenagers', especially those with tattoos (he calls them doodles). I enjoyed every minute spent with him, and his relentless grousing is highly entertaining. The ""Cat Annoyance"" was hilarious. This debut novel by Swedish author Fredrik Backman will make your heart feel a little bigger and a bit fuller by the time you finish. Excellent! "

It was good and had some funny parts… but I was a little disappointed. Everyone else LOVED it and was giving it 5 stars… but I was just not loving it. It was okay (3 stars) but nothing special. Well, this was because the main character was an extremely grumpy old man and the only way to sympathize with him was to feel bad about his childhood and past. BUT the second half of the book was AWESOME! You realize that the guy is actually very loving and kind. He is crabby, only to put up a front. He secretly cares and wants to help everyone.

140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/89672274-neale,Rating 5 out of 5,"A reread after watching the Tom Hanks movie. 22/03/03 When Ove is forced into early retirement, the loss of his job is the last thing that he has left to lose. The last thing that he was holding on to. Clinging with a death grip like it was a life preserver in a violent ocean. The last thing that gave his life meaning. The last thing that got him out of bed in the morning. Ove is not the kind of person you would call likable. On the likable scale. I don’t think he would rate a positive score. He’s angry, judgemental, belligerent, self-centred, the list of negative adjectives could go on forever. But through alternating chapters, we jump back and forth in time and this enables us to see the real Ove, and why he has become such a bitter man. We see a man prepared to risk his life and lose everything to save another. A man who will rebuild his house and build a ramp at the school for the woman who he loves more than life itself. A man who has been through incredible sorrow and loss. A man of principles and integrity. Ove decides to commit suicide rather than live in a world that he truly does not enjoy anymore. His connection to enjoyment was severed the day his wife died. It seems easy just to say toughen up and everybody dies, but everybody is different, everybody handles loss differently, and some love more powerfully than others. Please let me tell you a story. Next door to me lived a lovely old couple and every morning for as many years as I can remember they would be out in the garden, gardening together and feeding the flock of magpies that they loved. Recently the gentleman passed away from cancer. Each day as I would drive to work, I would wave to her as she was gardening on her own. One morning I waved, and she did not return the wave and had her head down. I drove around the block and pulled into her driveway. As I approached her, I could hear her sobbing. I hugged her and she cried and cried and cried. Sometimes love is so powerful that when that love is lost it is impossible to recover from completely. I told her she was lucky to be one of those people who had found that love and he was still with her in this garden. Sounds cheesy, but my point is that Ove reminded me of this lovely old lady. The narrative is a little bit predictable but who cares when it’s so heart-warming. A beautiful book. Oh, and I get up early each day and feed the magpies with the lady. It’s beautiful, just the three of us. 😊 5 stars!!!!"

143,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael,Rating 4 out of 5,"A moving testament to be ability of love to humanize a supreme curmudgeon. Ove comes off at first as such an officious, stubborn busybody, you want to laugh at him and not with him. Such a miserly haggler. The words “batteries not included” can put him in a rage. Anyone who doesn’t drive a Saab is an idiot. Still, his jaundiced views sometimes are fun to try on:In the parking area, Ove sees that imbecile Anders backing his Audi out of his garage. It has those new, wave-shaped headlights, Ove notes, presumably designed so that no one at night will be able to avoid the insight that here comes a car driven by an utter shit.Slowly, we come to see his bark has no bite, and his hunger to be needed is the grace in his core. She liked to talk, about books she loved or the delinquent kids she taught, and he liked to listen to her. He got sustenance from building her things, like bookshelves, or, when she became wheelchair bound after a tragic accident, constructing her an accessible kitchen or a ramp at her school: And after that she came home every evening for as long as Ove could remember and told him, with fire in her eyes, about her boys and girls. …The ones who could make her cry and laugh and sing until her voice was bouncing off the ceilings of their little house. …Every human being needs to know what she’s fighting for. That was what they said. And she fought for what was good. For the children she never had. And Ove fought for her.Because that was the only thing in this world he really knew.His long grief over losing Sonja has recently been compounded by the uselessness of being forced into an early retirement. He is on a downbound train. But life keeps intruding. He may snarl at homeless cats or people or at interruptions from his irritating neighbors, but he doesn’t resist much taking the cat in or helping these neighbors with their problems. The pregnant Iranian lady next door, Parvaneh, intrudes to browbeat him into saving the cat from freezing. There is such heart in Ove’s depressed humor, I can't get enough of it:Now, when it’s gone quarter to six and Ove has got up, the cat is sitting in the middle of the kitchen floor. It sports a disgruntled expression, as if Ove owes it money. Ove stares back at it with a suspicion normally reserved for a cat that has rung his doorbell with a Bible in its paws, like a Jehovah’s Witness.“I suppose you’re expecting food,” mutters Ove at last.The cat doesn’t answer. …“But in this house you don’t just lounge about like some kind of consultant and expect fried sparrows to fly into your mouth.”You will find he has reason to hate the men in white shirts and will come to root for his heroic attempts he will make to foil them:But everywhere, sooner or later, he was stopped by men in white shirts with strict smug expressions on their faces. And one couldn’t fight them. Not only did they have the state of their side, they were the state.As with A.J. Filkrie and Harold Frye, Ove thinks he just wants to say goodbye to life, but beginning to care about one thing leads to more and more threads that bind. I have a special place in my heart for writers who can make you laugh one moment and make you cry the next. The pain of living doesn’t have a chance of isolating you in defeat you if you join the land of idiots who can make you smile. "

The writing is pedestrian, the action is unbelievable, the characters (especially Ove!) are insufferable and I had enough with all the mentions of Saabs and Volvos. And why was Ove always kicking at the ground? How does one kick at the ground, anyway? The thing that annoyed me the MOST about this, though, is its overuse of simile and personification. On every page, there was a description followed by “as if...” My God! I appreciate how easy it was to read, (even though it took me two months to complete) and that’s probably the best compliment I can pay this book, but I honestly feel like I wasted my time even buying it. I’m all for writing that examines themes of death and grief, but this was way too sentimental for me to like or take seriously. How do books like this get such high ratings on here??? I’m definitely not looking forward to reading Anxious People which I bought last year as I already feel like I wasted my time buying that. This is a book I would have loved if I were perhaps 13 years old."

This book came out of left field for me. It took me completely by surprise. Fredrik Bearman now has a new fan.When I started to read this, I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. I thought this story would be an amusing tale about a cantankerous older gent with a bit of an attitude problem. Kind of like a Swedish Victor Meldrew**. But by the end of the book, I was both laughing and crying, for so many reasons.Audi, BMW and Volvo drivers don't escape Ove's scorn. Neither do ""woman drivers"". Owners of Hyundai, Toyota and Renaults models are not exempt. Saab is king.Ove despairs of a society where people are unable to reverse park, drive automatic cars, fix a tap, clear a gutter, not pay cash. The list is endless.”An entire society where no one knows how to reverse with a trailer.”As the story unfolded, I realised there was so much more to Ove than meets the eye. Behind the gruff exterior is a proud man, with a sense of right and wrong, who hides a wealth of emotions from the world. He is a man whose generation was probably not so good at displaying them. They weren't expected to. Men just got on with things. And tended not to think to too deeply about ""feelings"".” ‘Men are what they are because of what they do. Not what they say,’ said Ove.””Ove wanted what was right to be right, and what was wrong to be wrong.”But when Ove met his wife Sonja, his world was changed. Still nobody's fool, it was a love like no other. She was the yin to his yang, the sun to his rain. They complemented each other with their contrasts. He loved her with all his heart.“People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had.”💖 ”Love is a strange thing. It takes you by surprise.” 💖Sadly Ove loses Sonja at the same time as being made redundant from a job that he'd held for thirty years. His grief was immeasurable. What was his life worth now? How would he fill his days? What was the point? Ever efficient, Ove sets to work to end his days to join his beloved Sonja, but life has other ideas...There are some gorgeously comic scenes between Ove and a stray cat who adopts him. The cat even seemed to take on some of Ove's mannerisms 🐱 And the relationship between Ove and his neighbour's daughters for whom he becomes a surrogate Grandpa is simply lovely.This is without a doubt a beautifully written, heartfelt story about the pain of life and growing old. About the need to have a purpose, to feel that you mean something to someone. To be part of a community.Sad, funny, poignant. Bittersweet!This is another book that tugged at my heartstrings, and hit me in the solar plexus. Just read it.”We always think there’s enough time to do thing with other people. Time to say things to them. And then something happens and we stand there holding onto words like ‘if’.”
Trigger warning!
 Don't read this unless you have tissues nearby. Lots of them.” Life is a Curious Thing.”That it is Ove, that it is 😍** Victor Meldrew is a character in the BBC sitcom ""One Foot In The Grave"". Victor is known for his grumpiness."

The story of a lonely grumpy old man who tries to take his own life several times but because of the disturbance of his crazy neighbors, he keeps failing at it! The beautiful thing here is that the story gives us all the different sides of Ove, at the present time and also the past. His relationship with his wife, his fallout with his friend Rune. And from the present the bond that fate creates between him and his neighbors the Persian Parvaneh with her husband, the lanky, as Ove calls him!This story is all about people, about human nature and the beauty of people connecting together. It has lots of heart and soul to it. Not just the main character but all the characters in the story are very unique and relatable in a way or another. To be honest it is hard for me to choose a favorite character in this book. They all were wonderful. Fredrick Backman has created a neighborhood that makes me want to live in and neighbors that I'd love to know and connect with.There is a lot to this story, grief, losing trust, gaining trust, kindness and more. It is extremely engaging from start to end. There will be laughs, smiles, tears of pain and tears of joy as well. This one goes as one of my favorite books I've read this year. Highly recommended."

He has very strong beliefs and has a hard time understanding when someone doesn't go by the rules. This book is a deep character study which offers humor, a look at today's society and most of all speaks from the heart.Wow. It is only February and I am pretty confident that I just read my favorite book of the year. I saw that this was made into a movie starring Tom Hanks and I like to read the source material. My thinking is that it has to be good if it was made into a movie or television series. I understand why this was made into a movie. It made me laugh out loud. It made me sympathize with the main character while agreeing with him on certain subjects. But most of all it hit me in the stomach with the feels. While the basis of the story is following the daily goings of a curmudgeon man it has so much more. It is a love story with a message that there is someone for everyone. It is a story about loss and how we deal with grief after suffering from a great loss. It is a story of how people need connections in this world and to live not just survive. This book has so many layers and I loved every second of it.What a truly wonderful book. Reading the summary I thought how will I like the main character. That was quickly dispelled as I connected with him on so many levels. This is one of those books where you will connect with the characters. You will read this book in the hopes that everything turns out right for the main character as you go along for the ride. You will suffer his pain and rejoice with his positive outcomes or his correct actions. This is one of the best character books I have ever read. Do yourself a favor and read this book. I hope the movie lives up to this amazing book."
152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49444196-katie-b,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 starsTo say I went into this book with high expectations almost seems like an understatement. I've read 4 other books by Fredrik Backman that I loved so I figured the odds were good I'd enjoy A Man Called Ove. Plus, so many of my book buddies claim this one as their favorite by the author. Sure enough, it was a great read. Curmudgeon is probably the best word to describe Ove. He's the type of old man who is not afraid to speak his mind in any given situation. Most people steer clear of grumpy Ove and he's perfectly fine with that. But a young couple with two daughters have moved into his neighborhood and they don't try and limit their interactions with Ove. Kinda makes it hard for Ove to get any peace and quiet. The story alternates between the present and past which gives you a clearer picture of why Ove is the way he is. Fredrik Backman truly gets human nature and the ability to understand people is a tremendous asset for a writer. His stories feature the good moments in life, the bad, and everything in between.He brings a wide range of my emotions to the surface which enhance the reading experience. Can't say enough good things about this author and I'm looking forward to seeing Tom Hanks in the film version.Thank you to Book Club Favorites for sending me a copy! All thoughts expressed are my honest opinion.  "
153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149694522-karen,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read this ""classic"" a while ago and I am now bringing my review to Goodreads. I know...you probably have not only read this you have watched the movie, and then went out and watched Tom Hanks in his movie based on this book, ""A Man Called Otto"", right? So, why read this review? What could I tell you that you haven't already read? Probably not much different. Unless, you have been putting off this book, and you are still trying to convince yourself why you should still read A Man Called Ove. So who is Ove? You may think of him as a bitter neighbor from hell - grumpy, harsh guy who is a stickler for rules. But behind this cranky exterior, there is truly a story of sadness. And when a young family moves into the neighborhood, his solitary world turns upside down - and the lovable comes out in him. It may take awhile to learn what turned him grumpy in the first place, but, let the chapters grow on you. There is much to learn about the people who can come into our lives and affect us in meaningful ways."

155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71209063-stefanp,Rating 5 out of 5,"Smrt je čudna stvar. Ljudi prožive čitave živote kao da ona ne postoji, pa ipak ona veći dio vremena predstavlja jedan od najvažnijih razloga za življenje. Neki od nas s vremenom postanu svijesni nje da živimo snažnije, tvrdoglavije, halapljivije. Nekima je pak potrebno njeno stalno prisustvo da bi uvidjeli šta je njena suprotnost. Drugi bivaju toliko zaokupljeni njom da sjedaju u čekaonicu mnogo prije nego što ona najavi svoj dolazak. Plašimo je se, ali se ipak najviše od svega plašimo da će ugrabiti nekog drugog, a ne nas. Jer najveći strah u smrti je da će nas zaobići. I ostaviti nas same.Nevjerovatno koliko je Bakman vješt pisac. Kako sa lakoćom uvlači čitaoca u priču, prodirući kroz bedeme njegove emotivne strukture. On pronalazi zabačene, mračne kutke čovjekove ličnosti i osvjetljava ih na jedan pronicljiv način, taman toliko da se čitalac naglo ne iznenadi, imajući tako osjećaj da mu pisac pomalo laska. Njegova vitalnost se ogleda u premošćavanju lokalnih stega koje običnog čovjeka u svom njegovom mikrokosmosu tište. Kod njega nema pribjegavanja u metafikciju, već nužnost samih događaja čine splet okolnosti, a sam život zaista jednim čudom. Dubina njegovog pripovijedanja pruža mnoga gledišta za preispitivanje sopstvene stvranosti u odnosu na onu u kojoj se junak nalazi. Kad god je njegov junak pokušao da ode pod zemlju on je spasio drugog da ne ode pod istu.Uve, možda ujedno i piščev dvojnik pa i dvojnik svakoga od nas, predstavlja lik koji nosi breme čovjeka modernog doba. Podlost na poslu, eksprorijacija imovine, lažno osiguranje i ljekari u bijeloj košulji predstavljaće retrospektivu u Uveovom životu kroz koju će čitalac da prolazi pri divnom piščevom balansiranju između prošlosti i sadašnjosti, jer se jedno drugo vežu kao sitna crijevca. Uve je često u sukobu sa sobom i svijetom koji ga okružuje, ali to ne znači da je i nesrećan. Kao što je jednom Hese rekao, da i najnesrećniji život ima svojih sunčanih časova i sitne cvjetiće sreće, tako je Uve svoje sunčane časove pronalazio u svakodnevnom popravljanju, spriječavanju, pomaganju i ukazivanju. Njegova ličnost nije bila u potpunosti lišena društvenog života, naprotiv, sve više se udaljavajući od njega, takav život mu se sve više približavao. Po principu ako ti nećeš njemu, on će tebi. Od tada Uve počinje da umnožava svoja djela. "

It was crazy and quirky in pure Bachman-ish style. The writing was incredibly woven, using lyrical language in his wickedly humorous story. It will make you laugh, cry, and feel sorry for the characters--especially Ove. Plus, it tells takes of frustration and anger while lacking violence and profanity--bravo. As I moved through the story, I found myself and others from my past represented throughout the great book. The plot develops on this heartbreaking novel through bthe eyes of grumpy Ove. You might even see yourself in this wacky cast of characters. It touches a wide range of life-affirming feelings like, personal tenderness, celebration of love for life and acceptance of people. I even saw a bit of Archie Bunker in Ove.  I strongly recommend this light hearted, deeply moving novel"

We follow him through his train of thoughts, his experiences, and his love for Sonja - the love of his life, along with a cat that is not his.You'll laugh with Ove and (also) at his expense, you'll cherish him for his eccentricities, you'll understand his cogitation, you'll walk his journey with him and be glad you got to know someone like Ove (even if he's just a figment of Fredrik Backman's imagination).Death is a strange thing and Life is a curious thing - A Man Called Ove is a beautiful articulation of all these things in a subtle yet powerful way, you'll see.I absolutely love the book and would recommend it to anyone and everyone, you must read it!!!What an amazing read! Happy Reading!"

163,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57725883-rob,Rating 5 out of 5,"A stand alone by Fredrik Backman published 2014Plain and simply this was just brilliant. 5 stars are insufficient to relay my appreciation for what I have just read.Who would have believed that a story about an obnoxious, anal retentive, grumpy old man who, on the surface, had a swinging brick for a heart could be so engrossing and uplifting? Not me that’s for sure. Ove, a man in his fifties, is forced into early retirement. With his wife, and soul mate, now dead he lives alone resenting life and most of his neighbours.Although life, as he knew it, has changed greatly for Ove he still sticks to his daily routines. Someone has to check that the neighbours are taking their bins in and no one is illegally parked because if they are Ove is the man to put them straight.A new family has moved in next door, Patrick, Pravaneh who is very pregnant, and their two little girls.Ove has had enough of life and all he wants to do his join his dear wife in the here after.But whither Ove likes it or not the new neighbours need him. Several times and with meticulous care Ove prepares to end it all but just as he is about to take the final step there would be a knock on the door. Pravaneh wonders if Ove could help her with something really important.Much to Ove’s irritation the new neighbours ingratiate themselves into his life to such a degree that Ove’s desire to join his wife has to be put on hold for the meantime. If you ever feel the need to be up lifted this is the book to do it. It’s guaranteed to put a smile on your lips and bring a tear to your eye. A strong 5 star recommendation."
164,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Updated as just watched the Tom Hanks film version. Really excellent. Had to admit to dust smotes in eyes.Book bought for my recent birthday by a mate in Scotland. I think he thought it was about me. Story of a grumpy, autistic man who hates everyone including cats. But who is revealed throughout the chapters as a warm individual whose very presence affects those around him in positive ways. At Christmas time I am reminded of the film ‘ It’s a wonderful life.’ And the way George Bailey’s worth is shown by the effect his absence would have had on those around him. The book grew on me. At first I was not enamoured. But as the chapter stories evolved I was hooked. The running joke on Saab vs Volvo drivers was excellent. As in fact was the entire story.I note that there is a Swedish version of the book on Netflix and that Tom Hanks will make a version next year. I can see him in the role."
165,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne,Rating 4 out of 5,When I started this book I did not like it straight away - I found Ove to be a very unlikeable character. However I had faith in all the people who thought this was a great book and persevered. I am glad I did because it is a delightful story full of laugh aloud moments and some really sad bits too. I wish the author had made Ove older. 59 seemed silly to me. He was more like 79. That apart it was a very enjoyable read.

167,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91622714-rosh,Rating 5 out of 5,"Like I had mentioned in my Eleanor Oliphant review, books that come highly recommended tend to be read with higher expectations, and more often than not, you end up disappointed. But I can't believe I have been lucky enough twice in the same year to find a book that doesn't just match the expectations I had but goes well beyond it.If you want a detailed analysis of ""A Man Called Ove"", there are many brilliant reviews of the same and I anyway won't be able to match that standard. What I can only do is pour out my heart about the book.This is the first book since ""Wonder"" that made me live the emotions rather than read them mechanically. I rarely laugh out loud or cry with books, but in this case, I found myself not just doing the above but even snorting a couple of times (and I am certainly not a snorter!) The book unfolds like a roller-coaster, starting off slow and steady, and then speedily taking you through ups and downs and roundabouts; you just want to stay on the ride as long as you can, relishing every emotional high and low till you reach the satisfying climax. Just like ""Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine"", this book made me love all the characters in spite of, and sometimes even because of, their idiosyncrasies. More than half of these characters have real-life counterparts: the disgruntled old man, the concerned neighbour, the educated ignorant, the apathetic bureaucrat, the youth in the throes of first love, the innocent yet oversmart toddler, .... The characters were almost like a psychological case-study. Ove especially is to me so reminiscent of my father. I have always been very close to my Dad, but now I feel like I understand him even better, all because of Ove. Nothing in the book seems frivolous. There are no filler chapters, there are no obsolete characters, there aren't overt or covert complications. Every single person, house, car, animal and thing has a clear role to play in the development of the story, and this is sheer brilliance on the part of the author. This is not the best book I have read in my life, but it would certainly rank somewhere at the very top. Fredrick Backman needs to take a special session for all wannabe authors on how to capture your reader and enable them to effortlessly discover, know and love the characters you've created, while at the same time, not compromising on the integrity or quality of your story. Take a bow, Mr. Backman! You get added to my trusted authors list. Well-done indeed! ———————————————Connect with me through:

I am pre-disposed not to like it, I don't care for old characters who are placed in a novel for the author to be able to wax eloquently about the meaning of life.*But if that's your thing, Backman is probably the five-star writer of this century's chicken soup for the soul. It's like the Happily Ever After of a romance novel without a romance. It's like the feel-good safety of the Hallmark channel. Every ""twist"" and ""reveal"" is obvious and any reader should see coming from a mile away. The characters are magically diverse and everyone grows to be a better person by the end.I dunno, it's just not very realistic to me, nor is it very challenging. I don't want to poo all over something others like, though, so I'll just leave it there. It's a quick read. I won't read more by the author. Just not for me."
169,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35179119-linda,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have never read anything by Swedish writer, Fredrik Backman, but I decided to try him based upon all of the rave reviews I have read on Goodreads. My GR friend, Berengaria, described A Man called Ove as the ""ultimate feel-good novel."" I have to agree. In short, Ove is a curmudgeon, the penultimate grumpy old man. He has lost his wife of forty years and, in his grief, can find no reason to live. His half-hearted suicide attempts are comically interrupted by his new neighbors, a pregnant Iranian woman, two daughters, and Swedish husband. He eventually finds meaning through his relationship with them and others.Sound sad or somewhat sappy? It could be in the hands of a less skilled writer. However, Backman has a wry wit and an excellent eye for detail. He clearly likes Ove and the rest of the eccentric characters who inhabit the pages of this book, making A Man called Ove a light, enjoyable and entertaining read."
170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416888-heidi,Rating 5 out of 5,"No doubt (since I’m so late to the Ove party) others have written better reviews and book summaries, so I won’t even try. This book did everything a good story should— made me chuckle, cringe, smile and tear up. But mostly it just shows that love finds us, tragedy finds us and more importantly, being needed is universal. This will always be my favorite book of 2020— so fitting after the year we have all endured."

176,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50400620-tony-ludlow,Rating 1 out of 5,"In the spirit of full disclosure, I have only read the opening pages of the book. Actually, only page 1. That said, let me explain why I only gave it 1 star and quit reading.Ove, we are told on page 1, is a grumpy old man of 59 years old. He's curmudgeonly and inactive. He's sour. He knows nothing about technology and doesn't want to learn. Ove could be Ebenezer Scrooge. Life is a humbug.Here's the problem, I'm 59 and don't know anyone my age like that. I'm told there ARE such people like that, but they're 79, not 59. Backman is only 35 and Swedish. Maybe 59-year-old Swedes are like Ove. But none of my pals are. I'll use me as an example: I'm a Marine Corps vet. I'm writing this on a MacBook Pro. I own every tech platform out there: Kindle, iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch. I run a fitness program and do intense exercise 8 to 10 times a week. I've run 18 full marathons, 43 half marathons, and 124 triathlons. My last full marathon was last year when I was at the ancient age of 58! Next year I'll run two more half marathons. This year I started working on my Ph.D. I don't think I'm exactly typical, but I don't think Ove is even close to being representative of my age. None of my buddies from high school are Ove. Based on the comments I've read, most find this book to be an exceptional read and that Mr. Backman is an accomplished novelist. And that may be true. But for me, the main character is much too young to be believable. And quite frankly, it's a bit insulting to describe a 59-year-old man in such terms. My 45-year-old girlfriend agrees! "

Umor tandru, o construcție simplă dar spectaculoasă, tonalitate caldă și multă-multă dragoste este acolo. Și această definiție pentru dragoste: „A iubi pe cineva e ca și cum te-ai muta într-o casă nouă… La început ești îndrăgostit de tot ce-i nou, te minunezi în fiecare dimineață că-i casa ta, ca și cum te miri că, în orice clipă, poate să năvălească altcineva pe ușă și să spună că totu-i o mare greșeală și că, de fapt, nu ți se cuvine un loc atât de frumos. Apoi anii trec, fațada se scorojește, lemnul crapă pe ici, pe acolo, și ajungi să iubești casa nu pentru cât de perfectă e, ci pentru imperfecțiunile ei. Îi știi toate unghiurile și ungherele. Știi cum să faci să nu se înțepenească cheia în yală când e ger. Știi care scânduri din podea se mișcă atunci când pășești pe ele și cum să deschizi ușile dulapului ca să nu scârțâie. Știi toate micile secrete care o fac căminul tău”.E o definiție lungă și superbă pentru dragoste. Așa ca dragostea însăși. "

181,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8095953-lilith-black-bee,Rating 5 out of 5," PROS: • The most important PRO, and the main one that made me giving it 5⭐ is that this book remembered me of my grandfather. Even though he is still living in my memory, this book made me feel the closest to him that I could get, after his death. It was like most of the time I was reading the thoughts and dialogues of my grandfather, not those of Ove's. As you can guess, this book made me cry like a baby and made me realize how much I am missing him. How much I miss his grumpy, funny outside and his warm, soft, loveable inside. Even now when I am writing this review I am tearing up. This is why this book will always mean so much to me, despite the few flows that I have encountered during the reading. There would be a lot of other things to say, but because (I think) I am the kind of person that gets difficulties when it comes to speaking about my deep feelings, I will stop before I will start to write memories after memories of my grandpa'. • Simple writing, very easy to get into it, no big words. Just clean and soft ones. ( I am not including here Ove's curses lol)• Overall, a damn funny book, where I had moments when I was laughing like an idiot, beeing almost impossible for me to stop.• Diversity in characters, meaning sexuality, nationality and skin color.• Chapters wrote in past and present time. In the chapters where we have the past time action, we get to see why Ove is the way he is, and we get a lot better in understanding his decisions and believes. CONS: • Something clicked off when I was around 70-75% into it, and started to feel like I was reading a 6-700 pages book. This kind of took away my reading pleasure and made me want to finish it as soon as possible. Can't tell, so save my life, what was that made me feel this way, but even with all the funny and the meanings of a good part of the others, it felt like this book was way too long! If it was a novella then it would've been perfect, in my opinion!• Would have been nice to have more Parvaneh &Ove moments. I don't think that she had enough time in this book. Even though she is not the main character, I felt that Parvaneh was the second most important person in this book. And she was so damn funny, you have to agree! Follow me on

In this journey of life, it happens more or less to every one of us. This is exactly what happens to Ove. Ove is a man of fifty-nine. He is forced to ""retire"" and suddenly finds himself with no purpose in life. Being a widower of six months, he finds it absolutely unbearable to live without the ""only person who understood him"" - his wife, Sonja. So what does he do? He decides to take his life. What happens? A crazy neighboring family manages to thwart his plan. :)At times funny and at times so emotional that it breaks your heart and makes you weep, A Man Called Ove is one of the most powerful contemporary stories that I have read. Ove is the symbol of old age and loneliness, of a dying generation who finds it hard to adapt themselves to the modern world, and he is also the symbol of a last generation who really enjoyed the simplicity of life. I really liked the different perceptions represented through the life of Ove. So much is thrown in the way of the reader to think about. Chosen from quite unusual quarters, the characters contributed powerfully to the message the author was trying to get across. The writing was witty yet sharp and this combined style spoke directly to the readers' hearts. This review is no analysis of the book. I'm not going to do anything of that ""smart"" sort here.

Ove was such a complex character and it seemed it depended on the situation he was in on each chapter to see where his mind was; compassionate, angry, happy, sad, friendly, vindictive, devoted etc. I liked his interactions with Parvaneh and her family, Rune & Anita and ""the white shirts"" and how he came to either come to some understanding or put one over on them. Review #1 - Only got 45 pages in and just did not get what so many others enjoyed about this book.So now, I would recommend this book for those who want a good, easy and light read."

He believes in order, routine, and logic. He has been through countless tough experiences in his life, being tricked and cheated out of many things. After losing loved ones and being forced into retirement, all Ove wants is join them. Through numerous interruptions, he soon finds meaning in the most unexpected things. His small community begins to give him purpose.Ove is giving, and he’s a hero even when he doesn’t want to be. He forms worthwhile friendships and allows others to rely on him. Ove learns to let people in, works on being more open minded, and finds new sources of joy later on in life. I genuinely enjoyed this read and following along with Ove’s story. I liked the variety of characters and how they both joked with and uplifted each other. Ove is funny, witty, and blunt. I felt for him as he shared his heart-breaking and unfortunate past. The story is well written, and it takes you on an unexpected roller coaster of emotions, making you laugh out loud one page and feel deep sorrow the next. Overall, this was a surprising and delightful novel. It showed how we must persevere through hardships. Ove is an example of how we can always work on shifting our perspective to find new meaning in life."

Fredrik Backman, only thirty-three years old. You'll be surprised at his wisdom.
Love. I believe in it. In all it's forms. Pure, impure, fleeting, found, lost, unrequited. I am a master of love unrequited.But I am absolutely stunned by A Man Called Ove written by Fredrik Backman. Only thirty-three years old. A former forklift driver. Read it. Perhaps you will love it (as in the impersonal sense, see below) as I did.)Love. We yearn for it. Crave it. Give much for it. Think we have found it. Are often wrong that we have. It is one of life's great mysteries. Subject of the great works of literature, art, film.

Much to choose from...biology, chemistry, neurology....Biology...Oh, good. I think we can all relate to this. Let's see. Our authority here is Dr. Helen Fisher, author of Why Him?

    SEX!
  



The inimitable Dr. Fisher, also known as the ""Love Doc."" *ahem*
There, now. I have your attention, I think? Good. It's quite simple. Love is a very mammalian instinct, a veritable hunger, a thirst. Basically three stages. Lust! The interplay of testosterone and estrogen.


Also known as the ""Big Bang,"" ""The Earth Moved,"" ""La Petite Morte,"" INDEED.
 Which leads to Attraction! Oh, the increased production of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, which makes the heart beat faster, leads to loss of appetite,sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement. It's almost like the effect of amphetamine on the body!Which leads to more...

AND...


Birds do it, bees do it, even Albert Einstein did it...
Hmmm...meth addicts have told me that meth gave them the best sex they ever had in their lives. Of course, that is why they continued to use it, in the elusive attempt to achieve that same experience. But back to the illuminating work of Dr. Fisher. Unfortunately, the attraction phase only lasts for one to three years. Bummer. Which may account for the phrase, ""The honeymoon is over."" Or, ""The bloom is off the rose."" Or, ""The new has worn off.""So we come to phase THREE...Attachment! *ahem* Here's the kicker. Now you're dependent on the chemicals oxytocin and vasopressin. Uhm...believed to be important in pair bonding, maternal behavior, and some initial research indicating that oxytocin may be helpful in producing orgasm in women. Men are still reliant on pills, etc.,etc.,etc. In other words, either you go the long road through parenting or mutual interests. Good luck.


Thus spake, not Zarathustra, but Robert Browning
An Exercise of the Heart, Cynics May Exit Now.Ove, pronounced ""Oveeh"" is a most unlikely object of love. To the outside world he is a curmudgeonly man, unlikable, grumpy to the core, a stickler for rules and regulations which he will call anyone on at any opportunity. A stingy man who will argue over the cost of every item down to the bottom Kronor. He will park his Saab at a distance to save on the cost of parking. His home is a cold place, the radiators knobs turned down tight, again, a matter of thrift. He once had a good friend, Rune. However, they fell out. He really can't remember the source of it all now. But, he sees Rune responsible for the coup de'tat that removed him as president of the Home Owner's Association of their neighborhood, with Rune taking his place. He has not seen his old friend for years. Ove has no friends. He has no job. He has been forced into early retirement.Ove sees little point in living. Once he had loved. He had been married. Sonja. Sonja to whom he was married for forty years. She died. No one sees Ove when he walks to the cemetery to speak to her, caressing the stone that marks her grave.These two were really nothing alike. He was not a reader. She was. She loved Shakespeare. All books. She was a teacher. When they met he was only a night cleaner on the rail line. However he wanted to build houses. She told him he could be anything he wanted. He got his engineer's certificate. He became a builder of houses. He did not become a reader. But he built her beautiful bookshelves.
""People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had.""
My God. To love that way.And, as Ove would survey his empty house, still filled with all Sonja's things, he would think.
""You miss the strangest things when you lose someone. Little things. Smiles. The way she turned over in her sleep. Even repainting a room for her.""
The love Ove had for Sonja was not a one directional thing. It flowed equally from her. Her girl friends did not understand it. No one who knew her understood it. Everyone told her she could do better for herself. This is what Sonja thought.
""But to Sonja, Ove was never dour and awkward and sharp-edged... He believed so strongly in things: justice, fair play and hard work and a world where right just had to be right...Not many men of his kind were made anymore...So she was holding on to this one.""
Love transforms us. It is a wondrous thing. Love makes all things possible. The loss of it can make life meaningless. So it was for Ove. Is it any surprise that Ove would take his life to be reunited with Sonja? Not for me.Of course, Ove must make all things right. Leave no mess. All things in order. Proper instructions regarding all the property. A hole drilled precisely in the center of the living room ceiling. The proper hook to hold the rope. The proper noose. Kick the stool over. It's done. But the damned rope breaks. Ove lives in a world of incompetents. Idiots. You can't even depend on someone to make a decent rope anymore!And slowly something begins to happen. Pushy neighbors insist on violating his privacy. Borrowing tools. Good God. They have children. The woman is a foreigner. And pregnant as a goose! Her husband cannot even back a trailer! Her name is Parvaneh. From Iran? And her husband this IT consultant. He doesn't get up till 9, 10? What is the world coming to?Each day there is some reason that Ove cannot kill himself. He must save some idiot from himself. It is not a good day to die. Sonja. I am sorry. I know I am late.And on Ove's story goes. An insistent cat. A boy alienated from his father. A child who wants to be read a story. An old friend whom social services wants to take from his home and put into a ""facility."" A beautiful story of love that exceeds the personal to a much deeper level the Greeks would have called Agape. Outside one's self.This is a remarkable odyssey of one man's life and his experience of love. Do not be surprised if you shed a few tears, or more than a few. It is not surprising this novel has sold a half million copies in Sweden. Nor that it is selling so well in America. And the good news? Backman's second novel will be published this year. Watch for it. Get it. Read it. There is nothing wrong with a writer insisting that life is beautiful when he does so as eloquently as Backman."

I don't like doing things my wife tells me to do. There should be a reason things are done. ""Because the main character reminds me of you"" she said. There was a reason, not a good one, but there was one. ""Is he handsome, witty, and charming?"" I ask. ""No, he's a curmudgeon"" she responds. ""I am not a curmudgeon"" is my retort. She smiles knowingly and places this book on my pile of books to read. Of the last three books I've read I did not like two and the third was good but dark. I needed a change of pace for my next book, something lighter and more upbeat. I examined my stack of books to read and nothing there fit the bill. Then I picked up this book my wife insisted I read. It was the only thing that seemed to come close to what I was looking for. I've now finished reading it. I'm giving it 5 stars and placing it on special ""Highly Recommended"" GR shelf. What a delightful book, delightfully macabre in parts but delightful nonetheless. I will not tell you too much because I don't want risk ruining it for any reader. I am very impressed with how the author has taken the life of a very ordinary man and woven it into a very poignant and touching story. Ove is a Swedish man that life has dealt with rather harshly. He is orphaned in adolescence but manages to survive. Miraculously in his eyes, he finds love and builds a simple life. Unfortunately, life isn't quite through with throwing Ove bad breaks. He suffers two more serious blows and it is how he decides to handle these latest two events that is the focus of the book. Ove clearly never heard the old saying about how man plans and God laughs. This book illustrates that God must have a wicked sense of humor but it is not without design and purpose. This is one of the best books I've read since I found Mark Helprin's Freddy and Fredericka some years ago. Definitely a book to lift your spirits. And I am not a curmudgeon!!!"

Doing things for all the right reasons - (HIS reasons) - because “who else is gonna do them? Geez, what is this world coming to?” We need more Oves in the world, if you ask me. What / who is Ove? Over his lifetime he was all of these: Hard working. Unsociable. Incorrigible. Respectful. Loving husband. Eccentric Tempermental. Happy. Comical. Handyman extraordinaire. Hero. Widower. Heartwarming. Rude and Brusque. Lonely. Suicidal. Bitter. Angry. Perfectionist. Self-skilled. Prejudiced. Activist. Volunteer. Romantic. Exceptional. Judgemental. Emotional. Obsessive compulsive. Cranky. Sad. Grieving. I don’t know if I’ve even captured every character trait in the book of Ove, but I do know this man was a one in a million gentleman. He actually made the world a better place for many and challenged others that needed to be challenged or put in their rightful place (What he thought was their rightful place, anyway).😄I was laughing through so much of the book and I was rooting loudly for him all the way. He had a habit of getting himself in a spot of trouble here and there, through no fault of his own. How he got caught up in his neighborhood affairs was absolutely hilarious because he would be adamant about not getting involved/helping, and the next thing you are reading that he’s full on in it. And complaining the hell about it. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end; it was a glorious read and one that I most thoroughly enjoyed as one of the best books in my 2018 reading challenge."

He thinks himself surrounded by idiots - neighbours who can't reverse a trailer properly, joggers, shop assistants who talk in code, and the perpetrators of the vicious coup d'etat that ousted him as Chairman of the Residents' Association. He will persist in making his daily inspection rounds of the local streets. But isn't it rare, these days, to find such old-fashioned clarity of belief and deed? Such unswerving conviction about what the world should be, and a lifelong dedication to making it just so? In the end, you will see, there is something about Ove that is quite irresistible..."

Men who express their love by doing rather than just saying. And if you know my reviews, you know I always include a quote. So here it is. “Men like Ove and Rune were from a different generation in which one was what one did, not what one talked about.” In its own weird way, this book reminds me of the tv series “Doc Martin”. The same sort of loveable curmudgeon who was out of the room when the good Lord was handing out tact. Keep a hanky handy. Lots of opportunity for tears with this book. And laughs.

I'm reminded how we all grow up with our own set of rules. No two are exactly the same. This narrative shook me by my heartstrings. At times, I felt disgust and was tempted, figuratively, to send my Kindle for a ride in space. I'd read enough. I couldn't stand it anymore. Yet, at the same time could not help myself from turning page after page. The ending I came to discover, required the back of my hand.From early on, Ove was taught by his father, a blue collar, uneducated, working stiff, ""a man must live by his principles - for without them, he has nothing."" And so, Ove was deeply carved as a man of undying principles. To a fault. If nothing else, he could always depend on that. His sense of righteousness always took on an adversarial role with the ""white shirts"". The bureaucrats. The ones who decided what he could and couldn't do. Who were they to try to boss him around!? Run his life! So, the personal war raged on.Ove, it turns out, is not the hostile curmudgeon he shows to the outside world. Deep down, he's a very real person. Real hopes - wishes - desires. There had been no one close to him until he met the love of his life, Sonja. His lovely wife. They shared their life together. Almost forty years. She was his heart and and gave him the one thing he lacked, he needed - purpose. Then she fell ill. When cancer took her, it might have just as well have taken Ove as well. He wanted nothing but to join his wife. No reason to live. To merely exist. He carefully planned his exit from this cruel world. Like everything else in his structured life, it had to be done according to plan. No mistakes. No use waiting any longer. Was it too late to find a reason to live?"
202,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ove was lonely in the little house that he had lived in with Sonja for as long as a lifetime it seemed. But with his rigid principles, his daily routine and rules, he had no desire to come into contact with any of his neighbours. Especially since he and Rune, who lived down the street, had fallen out. And that had been the way of it for decades. His only love now was his Saab. Ove was the typical grumpy old man – never happy, arguing with everyone – but deep down, so deep he wasn’t even aware of it, Ove had a heart of gold.The day that he heard an ominous crunch come from outside his house, too close to be anywhere but his house, was the day his life began to change. That day was to see the arrival of a pregnant Parvaneh and her husband Patrick plus their two young daughters, a three year old and a seven year old. When they moved into the house right next door to Ove, he had no intentions of even acknowledging them – he couldn’t have an interruption to his routine now could he? Slowly but surely though, Ove’s grumpy nature was ignored by Parvaneh – she could see something deep within Ove that no-one else could see…What an absolutely delightful novel! There is sadness and heartbreak, happiness and many laugh out loud moments. It is extremely profound and deeply moving. This is a debut novel by Swedish author Fredrik Backman, and one I have no hesitation in recommending extremely highly. (Many thanks Carol for the recommendation).With thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for my copy to read and review."

Oh my goodness I don't think I can articulate in words clear enough to how much I love this book! You are going to go through every emotions reading this book! I laughed, I howled, I side eyed, I rolled my eyes, I snorted, I screamed and above all I CRIED! The last 30% of this book wrecked me to pieces. I had to keep wiping and blinking away the tears as the words on the page looked so blurry through my tears!If you don't manage to get any of those reactions I mentioned then frankly your a little 'Ove' and you know what that's absolutely fine too! I cant believe how in love I am with a grumpy old man, but here I am!This was such an endearing, heartbreaking story about a man named Ove, who just wants to be left alone to die and to be reunited with his wife who has passed away. The problem is he lives in a Cul de sac neighborhood with neighbours who are filled with so many personalities (Or most likely to Ove, just a bunch of idiots) just not making it easy for Ove to get on with it. The supporting cast (minus the woman with the dog) were all loveable in their own ways and I have an overly particular soft spot for Parvenah! She is so wholesome! This book will definitely be stocked on my Top Shelf at home, where I place my 'All time favourite books'. I really want to watch the movie adaptation 'A man called Otto' to see if they were accurately skilled enough to bring this book to life. Even if tanks, I know I will surely be picking this book over and over as the years go by to remind myself of OVE xInfinity ⭐"
204,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20015365-may,Rating 5 out of 5,"Warning: This will not be a very good review. Worth every bit of praise and love. Will make you laugh, cry, smile in wonder, feel your heart breaking, and sometimes you'll even start to wish there was an Ove in your life. I certainly do now. I LOVED Ove and Sonja's story:""She often said that “all roads lead to something you were always predestined to do.” And for her, perhaps, it was something.But for Ove it was someone."" When I started reading the book I kept thinking to myself ""if I met Ove in real life, I would not like him AT ALL"", but somehow the author succeeded in making me fall in love with him, grumpiness included. Sometimes people just can't help how they turn up, considering everything they went through. He knew very well that some people thought he was nothing but a grumpy old sod without any faith in people. But, to put it bluntly, that was because people had never given him reason to see it another way.I loved Parvaneh *my favourite* and Jimmy and Rune and Patrick and Anita and Adrian and Mirsad and the children and Lena and Anders and even the bloody cat. They were all so lovely and funny and I had a great time in their company. The writing was simply beautiful and I have to restrain myself very hard not to turn this review into a huge collection of quotes. The constant switch between Ove's past life and his present was done smoothly so it was not confusing at all. The pace was good and I never felt bored while reading. There was LGBT representation and the female characters were quite admirable, which I also tremendously loved. I just can't find more words to express how great this book has been, so please go ahead and see for yourself. Or Never you bloody mind, as Ove would say xDBut to Sonja, Ove was never dour and awkward and sharp-edged. To her, he was the slightly disheveled pink flowers at their first dinner. He was his father’s slightly too tight-fitting brown suit across his broad, sad shoulders. He believed so strongly in things: justice and fair play and hard work and a world where right just had to be right. Not so one could get a medal or a diploma or a slap on the back for it, but just because that was how it was supposed to be. Not many men of his kind were made anymore, Sonja had understood. So she was holding on to this one. Maybe he didn’t write her poems or serenade her with songs or come home with expensive gifts. But no other boy had gone the wrong way on the train for hours every day just because he liked sitting next to her while she spoke.And when she took hold of his lower arm, thick as her thigh, and tickled him until that sulky boy’s face opened up in a smile, it was like a plaster cast cracking around a piece of jewelry, and when this happened it was as if something started singing inside Sonja. And they belonged only to her, those moments.This is a great review I came across: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."

211,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.This is one of those books you just want to give a hug.Ove is, to put it mildly, a curmudgeon. He's not a very big fan of people. Or small talk. He believes in consistency, rules, simplicity. In Ove's mind, anything ""newfangled"" (cellphones, automatic cars, the internet) is unnecessary and just further evidence of how the world is growing lazier by the second. And don't get him started on people who don't obey signs, speed limits, regulations, or just common decency.""People said he was bitter. Maybe they were right. He'd never reflected much on it. People also called him antisocial. Ove assumed this meant he wasn't overly keen on people. And in this instance he could totally agree with them. More often than not people were out of their minds.""But as we've seen in books and movies galore that feature the angry curmudgeon as its main character (everything from A Christmas Carol to Despicable Me), there's so much more to Ove than meets the eye. He is fiercely devoted to his wife, the one person for whom he'd do anything, even if it was accompanied by some grumbling and complaining. He is firmly rooted in his idea of right and wrong, and will fight the powers that be every way he can if he feels the situation isn't fair or just. But Ove's life is shaped by sadness and tragedy, and his behavior is a reaction to what has occurred around him.When a new family moves in next door, complete with overly pregnant wife, clumsy husband, and two inquisitive young daughters, their first meeting is somewhat inauspicious—the husband flattens Ove's mailbox and drives into his flowerbed. (Another thing on Ove's list of dislikes: people who can't properly back up trailers.) But as much as Ove glowers and tries to push them away, they keep reaching out to him, they keep asking him for help, and involving themselves in his life—which leads him to (unwillingly) get involved in others' lives as well. And then the principled, fight-for-your-rights Ove comes out yet again.From the first page, you pretty much know what is going to happen with Ove's character. We've seen it before. But it is a testament to Fredrik Backman's excellent storytelling that you absolutely don't care. This is a sweet, heartwarming book, and although Ove is a familiar character, Backman has made him so complex—and fleshed out his backstory and his reasons for his apparent anger and unwavering adherence to rules and principles so well—that your heart just aches for this man.I've said numerous times before when writing reviews that I'm a total sap, and that when a book resonates with me emotionally I tend to really enjoy it. A Man Called Ove is definitely one of those books. At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to read a book in which I essentially knew what would happen at the start, but the journey that Backman takes you on is well worth it, even if there are familiar guideposts along the way. I found myself chuckling, and smiling, and even tearing up from time to time, so if a book makes you react in that way, how can you miss? "
212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17656456-poonam,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is my Book Of the Month- May 2017, with GR group- Reading Is Fun.This has been a fantastic read. I absolutely loved everything about Ove. If I have to describe him in one word it will be adorable. There were soo many instances where I just wanted to get into the pages and give him a hug.This book is originally written in Swedish and I read an English translation of it. The flow of the story was really good and I did not feel at any given time that I am not reading the book in the language it was originally penned down in.This was the first book I picked by Backman and I have got to hand it to him, he is an amazing writer. The book has a happy tone to it and then suddenly there is a sad moment slipped in or should I say there is a sad moment going on and then a happy moment is slipped in. It just is such a well balanced combination of happy-sad that it made me want to cry and smile at the same time.There is humor in the book and it is very subtle. I think it somehow works perfectly with this story. Here is a sample and this is the overall tone in this book.
""The husband just nods at her with an indescribably harmonious smile. The very sort of smile that makes decent folk want to slap Buddhist monks in the face, Ove thinks to himself.""
I don't think this is meant to be a romance and I am not shelving it as one but I think this is one of the most romantic books I have read in a long time.
""People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had.""
Soo much more depth and emotions in a few lines that 100's of pages of other book's can't convey.
""Ove had never been asked how he lived before he met her. But if anyone had asked him, he would have answered that he didn't.""
This also shows us how life is when you are young and how life can be as you get older. There will be ups and downs as it is part and parcel of life. All we can do is try to live life to the fullest.I never thought how it would be when I get old but this story made me think about it. 
""One of the most painful moments in a person's life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead. And when time no longer lies ahead of one, other things have to be lived for. Memories, perhaps.""
I hope I have as much love as Ove had in his life. That itself will be an achievement.I know this has been made into a movie and I am going to watch it as soon as I can. I hope it is good as the book has set my expectations sky high!!"
213,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105843363-suhailah,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’d like to capture all the feelings I had reading this book in a special little memory bottle and label it “heartbroken.” This was a very impactful story. I really appreciated the references to mental health and the mention of many difficult topics especially since they were all soaked in a bit of comic relief. Aging, loss, loneliness, regrets, and not having a sense of purpose are all topics that brush the pages of this lovely story. More often than not these events lead us to the development of bitterness which then often leads to the birth of dark humor. And I always thrive on dark humor! I’ll admit though despite it all, it still took me a bit longer than I hoped to read this because it was kind of slow at times. There was a lot of flashbacks from the past tying things into the present. But overall, the impact it had on me was pretty huge! Ove easily nestled his way into my heart, and I’m certain he will remain there for quite some time. I just really felt for him and even seen pieces of myself in his character. He is darkly comical. He is strong. He is stuck in his ways. He is lonely. He is hardworking. He seems mad at the world and society quite too often and very intolerant of idiots and laziness. And he realizes things aren’t made the way they used to be! But this story is so much more than even Ove’s unique character. It’s a story about finding your place in a world when you have experienced great loss. It’s about facing decisions that permit your dark side to give in or trying to stay behind and suffer/fight to keep on surviving somehow. If I’ve learned any one lesson from this story it would be that just because you aren’t born with something or have attained something at some point in your life doesn’t mean it may not later on appear for you in some other manner. Destiny often has a sneaky way of intervening when it’s simply meant to be. That being said by the end of the book, I was helplessly weeping. It started with small sobs here and there during the last 70 pages when small moments kept dropping in to make my heart hurt. Then I just got this sudden profound sense that sadness was approaching. Though, it will ultimately be left up to each individual reader to determine if it was a happy kind of sadness or a despairing kind of sadness. I’m keeping my answer a secret. Now I shall carry on with my fresh wounds from the emotions of this story and try to make it through the film adaptations. Wish me luck! Will plan accordingly and have some Kleenex nearby. And I’ll definitely need some fantasy reads in my life after this one to try to recover!!"
214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12800930-bharath,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ove is one of the best characters I have come across in books in a long time. He keeps to himself, and finds a lot of things to be not what he thinks is right. Most people frustrate him and get him into a cranky mood. So in many ways, he isn’t exactly the person you would like to have for company. And yet, he is extremely disciplined, has strong values and shows courage which is out of the usual when needed. He starts his day, typically by inspecting the neighbourhood for burglaries or irregularities, though it is not really needed. He is good at fixing things, all in the old classical style (not quite a modern technology fan). He cannot understand people wanting things easy, and being inept at stuff they need to know - reversing a trailer for instance.Ove’s wife Sonja has passed away recently, and he finds that life has far less to look forward to without her. Ove and Sonja’s was a strange marriage is what everyone felt – because Ove was odd, really odd. Ove stands by his wife after a bad accident – fighting the system for her when he needs to. And after her passing, Ove visits her grave regularly with flowers. Ove has new neighbours – Patrick, Parvaneh and their kids. Ove wishes they would leave him alone but they don’t, especially Parvaneh who looks at him as a father figure. What does Ove do now? And then there are also Rune & Anita who were family friends but Ove and Rune fell out. Rune is now in a bad way, and Anita is stressed. What will Ove do? And there is a cat, who will not leave him alone.The humour in the book is sophisticated and a delight to read. As you move along, the full range of Ove’s personality comes across. The book ends on a strong note as well, with something for all of us to take away into our lives – delve deep, there is very little to imbibe at the surface.At the end of it, just maybe, you will feel that it is not Ove who is odd, maybe it is all the others, and us.

Câu chuyện gây xúc động và thấm đẫm chất nhân văn, lòng tốt, tính lạc quan, sự chính trực, và sự tử tế. Dù có những đoạn mình không hẳn thích vì có một số hành vi hơi có mang tính lạnh lùng, cộc cằn và bạo lực, nhưng tựu trung lại, đúng là kiểu sách mình thích.Thật lạ là, những khi mình cảm thấy không thể tâm sự được với một con người, hoặc khi không có ai bên cạnh để bầu bạn. Những lúc có quá nhiều cảm xúc và nỗi lòng không thể bày tỏ cùng ai, thì chính những quyển sách đã lại ""cứu rỗi"" mình. Lần này cũng thế. Trải qua một mùa giáng sinh dài lạnh giá ở một nơi mà mình không có lấy một ai thân, không hề có một người bạn, thì quyển sách kỳ lạ và tuyệt vời này lại làm bạn với mình. Và kỳ lạ ở chỗ, dù quyển sách liên quan rất nhiều tới cái chết, nhưng nó không hề tuyệt vọng hay u tối. Nó nói về vẻ đẹp của sự sống, của tình người, nó nói về những phận người khó khăn và nhọc nhằn tưởng chừng như có thể bị đè bẹp bởi bao nhiêu bất hạnh của cuộc đời.

216,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,Rating 3 out of 5,"I didn’t enjoy this tale of a curmudgeonly Swedish widower as much as I expected or wanted to. Backman sets up a good balance between humor and tragedy, such that a character who starts off just wanting to kill himself (and trying to do so in multiple ways) ends up helping others instead. I liked the mangy cat and appreciated the flashbacks to Ove’s youth and early marriage as part of an odd couple with Sonja – “He went through life with his hands firmly shoved into his pockets. She danced.”However, the overall story was a bit too plotted and sentimental for me, and I had trouble believing that such a stick-in-the-mud could unstick himself over the course of just three weeks. Although the slang and insults are translated into (British) English very well, I also think there are probably a few aspects of Scandinavian culture that don’t translate as well, such as Ove’s absolute devotion to Saabs.A bit too deliberately quirky and sweet for me."
217,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25920410-julie-anna,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've been considering A Man Called Ove for a little while now, and I'm glad I finally did. As everyone says, this book is very wholesome. It doesn't seem to be that way when you start to read about Ove and his rude demeanor, but as the story goes on, the introduction of the other characters (including the cat!) transforms Ove's life. We also get to see his backstory, and why he makes some of the choices he does when it comes to others. It's been a while since a book made me so emotional. I've felt disconnected from characters in my recent reads, and this book brought me back to what books can make me feel. Even though you can tell from the beginning that the whole book is going to be Ove starting to change his ways, the journey to that mattered the most in this book and it was so well-executed.This was a perfect book for fall/winter, but I'd highly recommend it for any time.

I forced myself to read to page 43 but couldn't make it any further. I just know how this is going to turn out: old man is miserable to everyone around him but will come to see things differently after encountering a troupe of people (and possibly a cat) of various ethnicities, weights, ages and probably physical abilities, who are determined to befriend him and overlook his horrible social skills. Ove is so overbearingly miserable I just couldn't take him any more.And besides, he's only 59 years old. THAT is supposed to be an ""old"" man??? I just could not imagine a 59-year old acting this way. Unless he has Asperger's, but that didn't seem to be the way this book was headed.

There were some problems for me along the way, mainly with the cat and Jimmy in particular, and the author had me wondering if people age more rapidly in Sweden. At it’s core it is about loss, different kinds, and none of it pleasant. How it scars, shapes, and claims its victims, and how one can be determined to make peace with it, letting love and purpose be a guide through uncharted territory. Here, we experience it from an aging man’s bitter perspective between pages that are at times laugh out loud funny, then heartbreaking, quirky and endearing, then bittersweet. I left some watermarks on the pages thinking about things I need to do and say, and soon.“We always think there’s enough time to do things with other people. Time to say things to them. And then something happens and then we stand there holding on to words like ‘if'."""

221,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7317186-celeste,Rating 5 out of 5,"I remember when A Man Called Ove first took the book world by storm as a book in translation that everyone should read. Judging from the cover and synopsis, it didn’t at all seem like it would interest me. I’m not normally a lover of contemporary slice-of-life fiction. Give me dragons and magical libraries and quests to save the world from imminent doom any day of the week. As with everything, there have been notable exceptions, but A Man Called Ove didn’t strike me as a contender for that role. I can’t believe how wrong I was. This is a book that I loved so fervently that I honestly don’t have much to say about it. My words won’t be able to do it justice.“Men are what they are because of what they do. Not what they say.” Ove is the very definition of a curmudgeon. He’s been forced into an early retirement and now he just wants to be left alone to die. But life keeps getting in the way as new neighbors move in next door and old neighbors suddenly become a larger presence in the area. It seems like the neighborhood just can’t function without him. He begrudgingly starts addressing the problems plaguing those around him, engaging with life for the first time in a long time. Against his will and better judgement, he finds himself becoming part of a motley family.“You only need one ray of light to chase all the shadows away.”I loved how slowly Backman fed us Ove’s backstory. We weren’t immediately told everything we needed to know about him, and it was delightful to gain insight into his character and understanding of his worldview as such a meandering pace. I also was completely blown away by Backman’s characterization across the cast of neighbors. Each and every included character was vibrant and tangibly real, and were incredibly varied from one another. Ove’s internal monologue was likewise brilliant, and while I know there’s already a foreign film incarnation in existence and an American version in the works, I just don’t see how a screen interpretation could ever work as well as the novel, because that internal monologue is so important to Ove’s character. I’ll be interested to compare the story across the two disparate mediums. Even more, I can't wait to get my hands on every single Fredrik Backman book that has been translated into English. I think I found a new author to add to my favorites shelf.“We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.” A Man Called Ove is one of the most charming, delightful, funny, poignant books I’ve every read. I laughed more times than I can count, but that laughter almost always had to find its way around the lump in my throat, because tears threatened to hit the pages almost as often.

222,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov,Rating 4 out of 5,"How many times have you encountered a grumpy oldster and just shook your head and moved on? I was tempted to do so when I met Ove, but very glad that I persisted. I don’t claim to be any kind of expert in Scandinavian literature, but much of what I have read falls far to either side in the spectrum of dark versus funny. I experienced Clint Eastwood trying to tell a similar story in Gran Torino. This is far better and more complex. This story is both funny and touching.Our central character, Ove, has high standards and rigid ideals. Few who encounter him understand where he is coming from and either meet his wrath or his scorn. Yeesh! “He believed so strongly in things: justice and fair play and hard work and a world where right just had to be right.” His life story is told in a series of vignettes that jump back and forth between the present and critical incidents of his past. These include his current life in a subdivision and his time growing up, for the most part, raised by a single parent, his father. Ove’s father was also a man of principle who believed that a man’s work was his most important activity and that how a man worked defined him. Backman lets us slowly walk back our early impressions as we learn what makes Ove tick and what rules he sets for himself to get through life. We come to understand that there was a crisis early in his life when, at sixteen, he becomes an orphan and on his own. A few years later, (no spoiler alert) opportunity knocks and for some reason unknown to him, Ove opens the door. On the other side of that door is a life much richer than he has known. It is also, because of that, a life of greater pain when that life is taken from him. “People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had.”The door had “Sonja” written on it. She was a person who saw the rich potential of life in everything from her students to Ove. Her world was a world of thoughts to Ove’s world of things. “He never understood why she chose him. She loved abstract things like music and books and strange words. Ove was a man entirely filled with tangible things. He liked screwdrivers and oil filters. He went through life with his hands firmly shoved into his pockets. She danced.” When she is gone he tries his best to shove his hands (and his memories of her) back into his pockets. Backman reveals the deeper truths to us until the picture of Ove is more that two-dimensional.  Perhaps, Backman asks us to stretch our credulity a bit in seeing how Ove backs into a world that he no longer wants to be a part of. What we get in exchange is a chance to ponder some of life’s big questions and to enjoy a conclusion happier than either we or Ove expected. "

This is the fourth book I have read by Fredrik Backman and I have to say I am the biggest fan of his writing style. The way he can make me laugh and then with the snap of his fingers, suddenly I’m crying my eyes out. I’m not kidding, this book had me ugly crying and hyperventilating at 2am. I love the way Backman writes his characters, especially character relationships - romantic relationships, friendships and community dynamics. No one does it like him. Ove is such a complex character and I loved the fact that the community surrounding him got to see how selfless Ove really is. He has always helped people and never asks for credit. He just gets on with his day and his neighbours and community are finally seeing the person his wife saw all along. Someone who cares deeply but just doesn’t quite know how to show it. My favourite thing about this book was the neighbours/community brought Ove back to life. It was so beautiful to watch a lonely and depressed grumpy old man find a new family to love after he lost the love of his life. This is definitely a new time favourite book for me and it will be a book I will recommend to everyone."

Ove lives on his own and he chooses to keep to himself, which also means no socializing with the neighbors. So when Parvaneh, her husband Patrick and their two young daughters move in next door Ove decides he wants nothing to do with them and will just go about his routines as he normally would. Although Parvaneh can tell Ove is more than an unfriendly man it doesn't stop her from trying to get to know him as she feels that deep down Ove is not as bad as he seems to be, or is he? What a really wonderful read this was. I thoroughly loved this book and have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone who enjoys a great story. "

228,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22727329-victoria,Rating 5 out of 5,"I wasn’t in love with this book until quite a few pages in as I seem to have a difficult time relating to Swedish narrative style. I mean no offense by this, there just seems to be a cadence and distance that don’t pull me in. Yet, page by page, Ove became more endearing, understanding grew and then I fell in love with his community. There is a scene, it’s a small one, a graveside reconciliation that squeezed out a torrent of tears. It was not pretty, but from that moment I could not even think of rating this fewer than five stars. Because so much has been written about this book, I’d rather let the author’s words illuminate the little moments that gave me pause.You miss the strangest things when you lose someone. Little things. Smiles. The way she turned over in her sleep. Even repainting a room for her.Every human being needs to know what she’s fighting for. That was what they said. And she fought for what was good. For the children she never had. And Ove fought for her.…people at root are optimists. We always think there’s enough time to do things with other people. Time to say things to them. And then something happens and then we stand there holding on to words like “if.”Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist and yet it’s often one of the great motivations for living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we liver harder, more obstinately, with more fury. Some need its constant presence to even be aware of its antithesis. Others become so preoccupied with it that they go into the waiting room long before it has announced its arrival. We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.And time is a curious thing. Most of us only live for the time that lies right ahead of us. A few days, weeks, years. One of the most painful moments in a person’s life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead. And when time no longer lies ahead of one, other things have to be lived for...One finds a way of living for the sake of someone else’s future.I’m glad I waited to read this until a time when I could fully appreciate and ponder the simplicity of this story. After a personally difficult year and a tumultuous one in the world, I love the overarching message of connectedness and how we each play a part in the lives of others with acts both big and small.A happy new year to all, may we find more ways to be kind and considerate to one another."

""You are what you are and you do what you do, and that was good enough for Ove.""
This is a book that will stick with me for a long, long time. I loved its heart and humor, but most of all I loved Ove, the protagonist. Ove is not your typical protagonist; rather he is cranky and grumpy. Underneath his tough persona, however, is a kind, loving, and helpful man. I enjoyed reading Ove's backstory and seeing him grow and develop. I also appreciated all of the other characters and the unique experiences they brought to Ove's life. I would recommend this to anyone, and it most certainly will find its place on my ""favorites"" shelf. "

234,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56146790-whitney,Rating 3 out of 5,"Overall: A heartwarming story about a grumpy old man with a huge heart. Told in different storylines of past and present but both focused on One and his relationship and life with his wife. This story takes you on an emotional rollercoaster and I don't think I have ever read a more uplifting story focused on a character who contemplates suicide on a very regular basis. Lovely writing, interesting story and characters, have tissues ready! 3.5/5 or 6.5/10The Good: Ove is the stereotypical grumpy old man who ends up being much deeper and complicated then on first impression. I grew to love him as a character and rooted fro him, cried for and with him, laughed, and smiled a lot! This is the story of Ove and his wife and the author did a great job in making me feel every emotion throughout this story.""He went through life with his hands firmly shoved into his pockets. She danced..,, People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had....She just smiled, said that she loved books more than anything, and started telling him excitedly what each of the ones in her lap was about. And Ove realised that he wanted to hear her talking about the things she loved for the rest of his life.""The writing is beautiful as is their relationship. A lot goes on in this book plot wise and I felt engaged throughout the entire story. The Bad: It took me awhile to get into this book in the beginning but once it picked up I felt engaged throughout the entire remainder. This book will tear your heart apart and make you cry, which I am not a huge fan of unless it is the type of book that will stay with you and change your way of thinking. I did not get this with this book; though I enjoyed it and thought it was great writing and good characters, there was a lot of emotion and feelings but nothing very long-lasting. Some great points are made like find the joy/color in your life, embrace each day and the ones you love, choose life over death, etc. but all of these have been said before. Still a great book overall and would recommend but I did like Beartown much more.Favorite Quotes:At first you fall in love in everything new, you wonder every morning that this is one's own, as if they are afraid that someone will suddenly come tumbling through the door and say that there has been a serious mistake and that it simply was not meant to would live so fine. But as the years go by, the facade worn, the wood cracks here and there, and you start to love this house not so much for all the ways it is perfect in that for all the ways it is not. You become familiar with all its nooks and crannies. How to avoid that the key gets stuck in the lock if it is cold outside. Which floorboards have some give when you step on them, and exactly how to open the doors for them not to creak. That's it, all the little secrets that make it your home.Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the great motivations for the living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we live harder, more obstinately, with more fury. Some need its constant presence to even be aware of its antithesis.

I don't care about cars AT ALL and the book revolves around it too much. Also, I don't care if he didn't like cats at first, but kicking a poor animal and letting it out to die are two different things. . Luckily, the neighbor was there to save it Plus, talking badly about Jimmy just because he is fat was bothering me. I'm not fat myself but I know some people that are and I bet they would hate to read the things I had to like over and over again every time Jimmy appeared. The ending saved it all.

I won't say much beyond that as anything I tell you won't really do it justice. I sort of understand Ove and feel for him all the way through the novel. I get his frustration with the life and times he faces. I've fought frustrating battles with bureaucracy. I've wondered where common sense has gone.

Someone who complains about the youths of today and goes on about how this new fangled technology is destroying our society and talks constantly about ""back in my day"". I'm already kind of like that. Which is why I think I related to Ove way more than a girl my age should relate to a 59 year old man who's very set in his ways. I think I'm in need of a manic pixie dream boy. Does John Green have a hotline or a bat signal or something?The real star of this book was Ove himself. I know there are other characters, like the family that moved in and Rune and Anita, but they (well, with the exception of Rune and Anita) dimmed in comparison to Ove. I have a feeling that in a few months, I would forget their names completely but will still remember him to a T. He's such a great character, the kind of person whose bitter, but deep down inside loves so deeply. He's the kind of character that is rarely the center of a work of fiction, his place usually reserved as the grumpy-yet-endearing granddad of some teenage character. His relationship with his Sonja was also perfect. I loved the flashbacks of their life together, and the lack of her presence was felt acutely throughout the novel.The first half of this book was far funnier than the last half. The last half was good, don't get me wrong, but it paled in comparison, in my opinion, which is one of the reasons why this book didn't get a full 9/10. Still, the ending was perfect, if a bit rushed feeling, and had me swallowing back tears. Even if it did end a bit too pat for me. My only other complaints are that the writing was a bit too bloggish at times, with all caps, multiple exclamation points, and of course the dreaded interrobang. But those are nitpicks.So do I recommend it? Obviously. How can I not? It's sweet, funny, and utterly heartwarming. Don't let the presence of the translation scare you, either. This book is one of the best translated books I've ever read- you honestly can't tell that it was ever written in a different language. I kind of wish I read Swedish, just so I could compare the two.

I couldn't continue to read about such a bitter man. But of course hearing that Tom Hanks may soon appear as Ove, I had to ready myself for the big screen. I started again from page one and pushed through. It ended up not being that hard to finish it. No, Ove didn't find his way into my heart. Apparently, he's been a grumpy old man since the second grade so it's just ingrained in his personality I guess. But the author incorporated admirable perspectives about love, life, and grief, while adding some quote-worthy humor that many can relate to about changing times. I'm glad I finally read it - 3 stars.My favorite quote:“Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the great motivations for the living. Some of us, in time, become so conscious of it that we live harder, more obstinately, with more fury. Some need its constant presence to even be aware of its antithesis.

We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.”September 2017:I can swallow my pride and give this book another chance. It's been over three years since I DNF'd the first time so if timing/mood was an issue then it's had adequate time to rectify itself. I have seen such positive reviews for this title from readers I highly respect...and when Tom Hanks attaches himself to an adaptation? I mean, how can it be bad? Giving it another shot. I'm going to finish it this time!!! July 2014:I gave this book a strong 20% but just couldn't spend time reading further. I have interacted with too many bitter people who think the solution to their free time is policing others and casting judgment. I don't like Ove's character for this reason and even if he changes later in the story I don't think I can ever find him endearing. Maybe I'm the bitter one..."

Por momentos, me recordó a John Wayne o al Clint Eastwood, de Gran Torino, en lo cinematográfico.Y sin embargo me ha resultado una novela muy entretenida,con toques sentimentales y que se lee con agrado, plagada de frases rotundas y sensibles, y escrita de una manera sencilla y sin mayores pretensiones, más allá de incidir en que lo más importante está en el interior de las personas y no en su apariencia, aunque esta sea poco atractiva."

Так что он не жадный, просто его принципы таковы, что он не будет тратить деньги на то, что, по его мнению, установлена несправедливая, завышенная цена. Уве злится на Пармане, когда она предлагает заплатить за парковку или за прочие «ненужные» расходы, не потому что он сам не может заплатить, а потому, что он считает, что люди, не задумывающиеся о том, а стоит ли эта услуга этих денег, или, что это копейки, ничего страшного, развращают поставщиков услуг и товаров. Разве это плохо? Из-за того, что люди платят не глядя и растут цены на все. Уве умен, понимая, что с белыми рубашками-чиновниками, людьми которые ломали его жизнь не раз, бессмысленно бороться, потому что их много, а он один, тем не менее в борьбе за друга Руне одерживает верх с помощью своих друзей. Ему помогают не самые благополучные члены общества – в основном, меньшинства или бывшие ""трудные"" подростки. Почему? Потому что, во-первых, он им помог, и во-вторых, они способны оценить мужество противостояния в одиночку, способны понять важность взаимопомощи. Между тем, это история о любви, о горевании Уве после утраты горячо любимой им жены Сони, о его тоске по ней и потере смысла жизни после ее ухода, и через эту историю любви мы лучше узнаем Уве, мы видим силу его чувств, силу его характера. Ему удалось вернуть этот смысл жизни, который теперь заключался в том, чтобы помогать ближним где-то не без помощи Парване, Адриана, Иймми, где-то по воле обстоятельств, таких как потеря памяти его бывшего друга и врага Руне или спасения человека, упавшего на железнодорожные пути. Бакман поднимает много важных тем – о доброте, неравнодушии и взаимопомощи, о тупой разрушающей силе бюрократии, о том, что о людях нельзя судить по внешним проявлениям."

He feels like the sort of old man everyone should have living next door.Prickly and grumpy, grieving the death of his beloved wife of 40 years and being forced to retire, Ove believes there is nothing left for him in this life and longs for nothing more than to be with his wife but life hasn't finished with Ove yet. Brought up to be self-reliant and dependent on no one Ove does not suffer fools gladly, especially those who drive anything but a Saab. He believes rules should be followed and order will prevail. All that changes when his new neighbours move in and the tall, blond lanky idiot Patrick reverses his trailer into Ove's letterbox. Enter Parvaneh, Patrick's pregnant Iranian wife who's about to disrupt Ove's carefully ordered world.Although sad in places as Ove's life story is told woven amongst the present time, the story is also warm and humorous as Ove grapples with the imperfect people (and cats) who cross his path. The author fondly builds Ove into a man who is gruff but can't help himself from helping others. Definitely one of the best books I've read this year!"

The omniscient narrator gives you an account of Ove's life black and white, without excuses, prejudice and I could not help, but feel this total acceptance and sympathy for him, even though I know that such a miserly, old curmudgeon would drive me mad in real life. Reminds me a bit of my own grandfather, whom I tried to like for my father's sake rather than because he was a likeable man, and did not succeed. His views on life and attitude to people were similar to Ove's and as I child I could not understand him or the strikingly different world he was living in. As an adult, I still do not think he was a good or an easy man, but through the screen of Ove's story I found myself thinking about him and my feelings got somehow softened. So, WOW & thank you, Fredrik Backman & Ove."

Inúmeras vezes Ove faz-nos desesperar com as suas atitudes e a sua incompreensível arrogância, mas, simultaneamente, vamos criando empatia com o seu pragmatismo e conseguimos, compreender e aceitar as sua atitudes e os seus ""bizarros"" comportamentos; mas Ove é forçado a mudar e a aprender, ""precisa"" de começar a entender os seus vizinhos e os novos tempos de mudança, acabando por revelar uma incorruptibilidade e uma lealdade sem limites, mas, concomitantemente, uma paixão desmesurada pelas ""pessoas"", pelo ""seu"" gato, e pela vida.  Recomendado: para quem tem mais de cinquenta anos, para quem acredita na bondade, no amor e na felicidade, apesar das agruras da vida; para quem gosta de leituras divertidas, “tipo” uma comédia dramática, excepcionalmente bem escrita, sobre a amizade inesperada e improvável, e para quem acredita na mudança e no amor eterno...

256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30505436-shruti,Rating 5 out of 5,"“One of the most painful moments in a person’s life probably comes with the insight that an age has been reached when there is more to look back on than ahead.”If I'm being honest, I was reluctant to read this; books about old people and old age invariably make me sad. It's just one of those things that I try to avoid because I'll probably relate these characters to my own grandparents and then get upset if the said characters are sad or lonely or die. But a friend of mine loved this book and raved about it, I finally decided to read it. And to my surprise, this book did not upset me in the slightest. In fact, it did quite the opposite. A Man Called Ove is about an old man who is grumpy and bitter and all the adjectives you can think of that are synonymous to unpleasant. He decided a long time ago that he wasn't going to be the sort of person that people took for granted and so he grew into this laconic stickler for rules, who detested technology and any car that wasn't a Saab, with a passion. So even after the people around him knew that Ove was a piece of work, I thought it was wonderful that they still cared for him. The several friendships that he formed—even though Ove never acknowledged them as such—were heart warming. His character development (if you can call it that) was so special. This book tackled concepts that I dread, the same that were keeping me from reading this book—loneliness, and a belief that your life no longer has a purpose—with a surprising, optimistic light heartedness. It was something I didn't expect from this book; its ability to put my mind at ease. Fredrik Backman has a gift to enrapture readers with his beautiful imagination and incredible story telling skills. There was a part of me that felt like he managed to blur the line between fiction and reality with his characters and all their flaws. Also, Henning Koch did a marvelous job at translating this book. Every time I read a quote (this book has numerous), I'd remember that there was someone who so skillfully captured the essence of the story in English; a story that made me laugh and cry and feel all different sorts of emotions. I am extremely grateful for this book and no matter how many times I try to put into words how A Man Called Ove made me feel, I don't think I'll ever be able to get it right. So I'm just going to settle for what I've typed out right now. And now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to leave you with this quote as I spend some time with my grandpa. “… but all people at root are time optimists. We always think there's enough time to do things with other people. Time to say things to them. And then something happens and then we stand there holding on to words like 'if'.”"

I loved the book so much that I ended up watching the Swedish movie as well, which I am afraid to say I did not enjoy as much.But I really hope and wish that Bollywood picks up the story and casts Mr. Amitabh Bachchan in the lead role!!

Who can’t use a feel-good story?In this novel, Ove, the curmudgeon old man (although I don’t personally consider 59 to be an old man), wants a well-ordered existence, and he doesn’t tolerate foolish behavior, or illogical behavior. Oh, and he’s a mutterer. He’s one of those people that mutter sarcastic comments under his breath when he is at the end of his (very short) tether. Backman writes Ove so the reader sees his logic, sees the world through Ove’s cranky eyes. And the world is funny when written cleverly as Backman does. Ove gets new neighbors, and his life is impacted, against his will. In fact, he turns kindhearted, against his will. We do enjoy crabby old men….when they are written in literature or on film…not when they are our neighbors. Backman writes a fabulous crusty old man. It’s a great book."

You become familiar with all its nooks and crannies. How to avoid that the key gets stuck in the lock if it is cold outside. Which floorboards have some give when you step on them, and exactly how to open the doors for them not to creak. That's it, all the little secrets that make it your home.”A Man Called Ove is described as being about a “grumpy yet loveable … curmudgeon” whose “solitary world [is] turned on its head when a boisterous young family moves in next door.” In that respect, it’s like other, similar books—such as  Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine and  The Perks of Being a Wallflower—where a solitary character is dragged into a new social circle and slowly blossoms. These books are all hugely popular, and I didn’t really like any of them, so I guess you better get ready for an 🚨 unpopular opinion 🚨.All of these books seem to me to suffer from a serious bait-and-switch problem. Ove is described as having “a story and a sadness” beneath his “cranky exterior.” Ummm, no. He is, in fact, suicidal and in serious need of psychological help. And it’s largely played for laughs, like in the classic John Cusack 80s movie Better Off Dead. It kinda works within the story, but would be horrifying in real life. So you go into the book expecting a lighter story than it actually is. I didn’t hate A Man Called Ove, and it does ultimately have a sweet ending. But it is the first book by Mr. Backman that I’m not rating at 5 stars, and that does make it disappointing."

A man who feels that what defines a man is not what he speaks but his actions. A man with such strong beliefs that he is ready to fight with anyone for it. An inflexible man. A man who doesn't care even a bit about how he is perceived. A simple man with tremendous clarity of thought. A man who never minces his words. A man whose behavior is completely in sync with his feelings and a man whose beliefs are unwavering even in the most difficult of times.Ove has specific ways that he likes to do things, and his way is the only ‘correct’ way. He does not like most people.Sonja, his wife, was the only ray of sunshine in his life. “People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color.

'Death is a strange thing. People live their whole lives as if it does not exist, and yet it's often one of the great motivations for the living. We fear it, yet most of us fear more than anything that it may take someone other than ourselves. For the greatest fear of death is always that it will pass us by. And leave us there alone.'
Every once in a while comes a protagonist so lovable, that you know will always stay with you.Ove is a curmudgeon in every sense of the word. He can never stop grumbling about the changes that are constantly taking place around in the way people live, the annoying people of his neighborhood in general, and anyone who does not own a Saab in particular - among other things. But beneath this grumpy exterior lies the most genuine, honest bear of a person.With the narrative switching between the past and present, we learn of Ove's story of love, loss, and principles. It would be pretty darned impossible to not be smiling AND crying by the time you reach the end of the book.It is easily my favorite read of the year, and is understandably one of the most popular feel-good contemporaries around.

276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863523-laysee,Rating 4 out of 5,"My favorite curmudgeonly old man in literary fiction is GB Edwards’ Ebenezer Le Page. The next is Ove, the main character in Fredrik Backman’s debut novel. Ove is a formidable 59-year-old Swedish man. He is bitter, argumentative, distrustful, penny-pinching, and socially aloof. Ove is fiercely loyal in an amusing way – suggest driving a car other than a Saab and you’ll be in serious trouble. You would not want to be his neighbor. And yet, as it turns out, he is the best neighbor one can ever ask for.A new family moves into Ove’s neighborhood and begins to knock frequently on his door to request a train of unimaginable favors. It is hilarious reading the social exchange that takes place between Ove and the pregnant Iranian woman, her clumsy husband and their young daughters. It is delightful to read about the friendship and trust that grow and deepen as Ove begins to go out of his comfort zone to help his hapless neighbors. Every crusty old soul has a story to tell. Ove too has a very sad history that will break your heart.Although I will not consider this great literary fiction, it is a highly readable and enjoyable book. The prose is simple and direct. When you are least expecting it, a line or two steals up on you and gently prods you on the inside. Take this book with you on your next vacation. Ove is great company, and like me, you will grow to love him."

If you have read ""Britt Marie was here"" and ""my grandma asked to tell you I'm sorry"" and you liked those then you will love this one as well. We all know one person like the main character Ove in our lives , a grumpy old man but what we don't know and sometimes forget is that every person has a story and a reason to be the way they are . This book explores that aspect in a very well executed arch plot . You see all Ove wants to do is die to join his wife , but the arrival of certain people and a cat will have an impact on his life that will remind him that while sometimes we are not dead yet , we forget to live (quote from the book itself) . The story progresses from then and you start to understand Ove and his character. I love what this author has managed to do with all the characters he has come up with . Good job sir !"

I did find this book to be a bit sad and too slow. But the author’s writing is brilliant. I loved the structure of this book and how he was able to go between the present and the past without causing confusion. I think that the translator did a great job because I was able to feel a lot of emotions. And I did cry at the end."

He appears rough and unfriendly, but when you look beyond his gruff exterior he is just a grieving sad man. It reminds us not to judge a book by its cover and shows that everyone has beauty hidden beneath. The character of his wife Sonja and his neighbor see the good in everyone including Ove. Everyone just wants to be needed and loved."

Again.By turns hilarious and then wrenchingly moving, this 5 star read is on my ""favorites"" shelf. If one could cross the stories from the old Christmas classic,  It's A Wonderful Life and the animated movies Up and Despicable Me, this would be the result. A cantankerous codger is just fine being miserable, thank you very much, until a cadre of new neighbors interrupt and derail him from his journey toward darkness. There are aspects to the character of Ove (pronounced Oo-vah) that I didn't especially care for, yet that made him that more real. We all have a blustery old uncle or grandfather or neighbor that has some sharp edges to him, but when we know some of what he has been through, we understand a portion of his outer shell. We may not agree with his viewpoints on all things, but who said loving someone is a judgement call?I listened to this over the Thanksgiving holiday during a long car ride because my 13 year old - who read the book last year - loved it so much that he nominated it for his book club. The kids (and even the parents this time) will be discussing it tonight. Because my ear was attuned this go-round to how a 13 year old audience would receive it, it occurred to me that those who have had loved ones that have considered suicide or gone through with that act might find the story too raw.As in the Frank Capra film mentioned above, the main character finds himself in the position of considering ending it all. While this book has dozens of laugh-out-loud moments, they are interspersed with numerous heartbreaks in Ove's past. His character is only 59 years old, yet his nature and losses over the years contribute to the attitude of a man probably in his 70s or 80s.That said, this is a very hopeful book. It is a story of redemption. There are some tall tales involving a cat-annoyance that add to the smile-factor. While Ove starts out intent on seeing nothing worth living for, one never knows when excitement, battle plans, smashed mail boxes, or total nitwits will railroad you into happiness. Loved this!"

I kept seeing Ove as a cartoon character in my head while reading this book. Perhaps that is because his character is so over the top, dare I say, ""cliche"" that I just couldn't picture him as a real person.This book is both heartwarming and funny however, if you do not get the certain brand of humor that this book offers then you will not get to the heartwarming part and actually feel it for what the author was trying to convey.Ove reminds me a lot of Jack Nicholson's character from As Good As It Gets and TBH I tried three times to get through that movie and fell asleep all three times. (This is coming from a tremendous movie buff y'all).I don't know, I just couldn't get into this book. I'm glad that other people have enjoyed it though."

Ove is not very good at making great first impressions. Or second or third ones for that matter. He is not very likable but that’s okay because he doesn’t like people much either. Until new neighbors move in next door and just won’t leave him alone.You could look at this book as a grumpy-sunshine love story. But not your usual one, rather a story of what happens to the grumpy after his sunshine is gone. And yes it is heart-wrenching, but it’s also hilarious at times and heartwarming at others. It’s a story about life becoming bearable again after you’ve thought it was no longer possible and about allowing yourself to enjoy it. It’s not easy but it’s possible and worth it. Strangely enough, despite all the tears, I discovered that a book about an old, grieving curmudgeon can be uplifting."

Este prima carte citită de la Backman și mai mult ca sigur voi citi și alte cărți scrise de el. Are un stil aparte, dulce, mieros dar cât se poate de real.Povestea lui Ove a fost ca o melodie suavă de pian, cu note înalte pe alocuri. Dacă pe la început nu-l înțelegeam pe Ove, dar râdeam rău de vorbele lui, după prima parte a cărții stăteam cu sufletul la gură să văd ce-i mai trece prin cap lui Ove, de ce face ce face, de ce e așa cum e... Povestea lui m-a marcat teribil și pot spune că pe la sfârșitul cărții m-am despărțit de un prieten. Sonja, Parvaneh, pisica și toate personajele i-au conturat caracterul cum nu se poate mai bine. Pot spune că m-a surprins pe alocuri, dar mă așteptam ca Ove să se dea pe brazdă și să-i pese mai mult de cei din jur, nu doar de Sonja. A fost o schimbare bine venită și așteptată de toți cititorii.Scenele în care era țâfnos și agasant erau așa de amuzante dar în același timp l-am înțeles de ce se comportă așa. Cum spunea Backman la un moment dat în carte... El și Rune s-au născut în epoca greșităș ei vor să trăiască cu un job, cu o viață organizată și cu cât mai puține surprize. Dar Ove a avut parte de câteva surprize care l-au făcut să aprecieze mai mult viața. O să las mai jos câteva citate care m-au sensibilizat teribil:""Înțelegea unghiurile drepte și instrucțiunile clare. Machete și schițe. Lucruri care puteau fi desenate pe hârtie. Pentru el totul era alb sau negru .Iar ea era culoare. Toată culoarea lui."",,Pe Ove nu-l întrebase nimeni, înainte să o întâlnească pe ea, care era viața lui. Dar, dacă l-ar fi întrebat cineva, ar fi răspuns că nu trăise până atunci.'',,Tu dansezi pe dinăuntru, Ove, când nu te vede nimeni. Și pentru asta o să te iubesc toată viața. Fie că-ți convine au ba.''""A iubi pe cineva e ca și cum te-ai muta într-o casă nouă. La început ești îndrăgostit de tot ce-i nou, te minunezi în fiecare dimineață că-i casa ta, ca și cum te temi că, în orice clipă, poate să năvălească altcineva pe ușă și să spună că totu-i o mare greșeală și că, de fapt, nu ți se cuvine un loc atât de frumos. Apoi anii trec, fațada se scorojește, lemnul crapă pe ici, pe colo, și ajungi să iubești casa nu pentru cât de perfectă e, ci pentru imperfecțiunile ei. Îi știi toate unghiurile și ungherele. Știi cum să faci să nu se înțepenească cheia în yală când e ger. Știi care scânduri din podea se mișcă atunci când pășești pe ele și cum să deschizi ușile dulapului ca să nu scârțâie. Știi toate micile secrete care o fac căminul tău."""

She found it easy to forgive than Ove did. Forgive God and the universe and everything. Ove got angry instead. Maybe because he felt someone had to be angry on her behalf, when everything that was evil seemed to assail the only person he'd ever met who didn't deserve it. So he fought the whole world.
A million stars don't seem fitting to express my love for this one. I love love love 
LOVE
 this book so much. One sunny afternoon, I was left with nothing to do so I thought might be good checking out new movies in the cinema; then I picked A Man Called Otto because there weren't many other choices, and it sounded intriguing anyways. I was sobbing throughout the movie, mainly because I found Otto as a relatable character─at the same time, reminding me of my own grandfather─and the other reason being I've always been a crybaby. So, I knew, going into this book, I most likely am going to cry. But it still didn't prepare me enough, I still cried in every other pages and Ove doesn't leave my mind even after days passed. This book wrecked me like no other. It broke my heart into pieces and I don't think I will ever recover."

Truly a sweet story about a man struggling without his wife and who kept himself going as long as he could by being the neighborhood watchman and enforcing the rules. When that has run its course it seems the end has come to Ove, but it is only then that the true story begins.

A Man Called Ove
 has been on my TBR for years and the paperback copy had been sitting on my bookshelf for just as long. I was originally “intending” to finally read this book last year, as I had read 
Anxious People
 (my first exposure to Fredrik Backman’s work) the year before and loved it. But then one of my book clubs decided to read 
Beartown
, so I picked up that one next, and of course, like everyone else who read that book, I fell hard for the characters (and the story) — so much so, in fact, that as soon as I turned the last page, I immediately picked up the sequel 
Us Against You
 and flew through that. Then, just when I was experiencing major 
Beartown
 withdrawal, I miraculously scored an advance copy of 
The Winners
 (the third and final book in the trilogy) and devoured that 688 page tome in one sitting (and even though I cried through much of that book, I still loved every minute I spent reading it). After that, I spent the last couple months of the year fighting the urge to re-read the entire trilogy all over again (mostly because I had a boatload of other books that I knew I had to get to). Anyway, I’ve digressed…so I decided to finally pick up 
A Man Called Ove
 because I knew the American movie remake starring Tom Hanks would be out this month and since I MIGHT go watch it (I’m still on the fence technically), I figured now would be as good a time as any to read the book. Also, in another stroke of perfect timing, I attended the Livestream interview that Fredrik Backman did with the Center for Fiction last week where he talked about Ove as well as the movie adaptation, among other things (the entire interview was absolutely fantastic — I came out of that interview loving Backman even more than I already did, lol). So yes, I finally read Ove and it was as amazing as I expected it to be. From the story to the characters, I loved every aspect of the book, which had me laughing one minute and crying the next minute. Backman is one of those rare writers who is so adept at striking that perfect balance between sad and serious in his stories (which are my absolutely favorite type of stories to read!). Just like with his other novels, in 
A Man Called Ove
, Backman explores the many nuances of the human condition that are resonant and relatable — themes such as loneliness, community, society ills, prejudice, grief and loss, parenthood, friendship, etc. — and ties everything together into a masterful story that is heartwarming and poignant, sad and somber, yet also funny and ultimately hopeful, all at the same time. Now after having read 5 of Backman’s novels (I intend to be a completist and read all of his works at some point), one of the things I’ve noticed about his writing is that it is always so earnest and full of heart. After watching his most recent interview, I realize now how much of his own vulnerabilities he both knowingly and unknowingly incorporates into his stories — for example, with the character of Ove, he reflects his own awkwardness in social situations, his difficulty communicating with people, his wife being his main connection to the world and other people, etc. The way Backman is able to be so “spot on” when writing about the various aspects of the human condition — our feelings, emotions, relationships — it imbues his stories with an honesty and sincerity that makes his works especially accessible and endearing.It’s probably obvious already that Backman is one of my favorite authors — I will pretty much read anything he writes at this point. With that said, I haven’t actually read all of his backlist works yet, but as I mentioned earlier, I very much intend to be a Backman completist, so it’s just a matter of time before I get to the rest of his books. I am absolutely looking forward to it!"

Be kinder than necessary for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle.
Ove is a curmudgeon of the highest order. He believes in order, rules and principles. To say that he is set in his ways would be a gross understatement. As the story opens Ove is fifty- nine years old, forcefully retired, bitter, alone and unsure how to fill his days. . I am pretty sure I have met him more than once in my lifetime. I can honestly say I did not like him and I did not much care for the Ove in this story on first blush either.More than anything Ove longs to leave this life of posers and rule breakers and be reunited with his beloved Sonja.He went through life with his hands firmly shoved in his pockets. She danced. People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had.If I am going to be completely honest I knew, as a reader does, that the author was going to try and get me to change my mind about Ove. And he succeeds. (Makes one wonder about the other cantankerous people I have met and chose not to get to know better)I have also never met a cat that likes car rides and even though I personally had three of them that would follow on my heels as I went for evening or early morning strolls in the park, they would quite quickly scatter the moment a stranger got too close to our hallowed space, so no, they were not accompanying me to any coffee shops or book stores.And it is true I saw the plot turns coming long before they arrived.None of that mattered though. I was transported through every line by Backman’s clean, fresh cut prose, the fragrance of newly mown lawn in my nostrils, while I was swept away by the heart in this story.Would be readers should be warned and prepared to contemplate life and love.For now I will leave you with my favourite quote.Loving someone is like moving into a house. At first you fall in love with all the new things, amazed every morning that all this belongs to you, as if fearing that someone would suddenly come rushing in through the door to explain that a terrible mistake had been made, you weren’t actually supposed to live in a wonderful place like this. Then over the years the walls became weathered, the wood splinters here and there, and you start to love that house not so much because of all its perfections, but rather for its imperfections. You get to know all the nooks and crannies. How to avoid getting the key caught in the lock when it is cold outside. Which of the floorboards flex slightly when one steps on them or exactly how to open the wardrobe doors without them creaking. These are the little secrets that make it your home.Thank you Lynda!"

This book is a deceptively light read that will leave the reader reflecting on a series of universal topics relevant to all human beings, such as friendship, affection, loneliness, solidarity, honesty, incomprehension, indifference, etc.Highly recommended. 4.5 out of 5 from me.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Este libro me sorprendió, pues lo que arranca como un relato equis va ahondando lenta y sútilmente en la vida y la personalidad de un hombre aparentemente amargado y poco amigable pero quien -conforme iremos descubriendo al avanzar la trama- tiene una íntegridad sólida y unos valores claros y firmes poco comunes hoy en día. De naturaleza taciturna, Ove se ha convertido en un ser sumamente triste y solitario desde que enviudó, sintiéndose fuera de lugar y sin sospechar siquiera que la vida le depara aún un poco de felicidad y alegría en un pequeño grupo de casi extraños que se convertirán en su familia postiza. Es reconfortante ver cómo este hombre que se siente irrelevante y tan deprimido que su deseo más grande es morir va despertando poco a poco a la vida una vez más, cómo va descubriendo que no es un cero a la izquierda que a nadie le importa, cómo su corazón vuelve a sentir un poco de alegría y su vida cobra sentido de nuevo.Este libro es una lectura aparentemente leve pero que nos hace reflexionar sobre una serie de temas universales e importantes para todos los seres humanos, tales como la amistad, el cariño, la soledad, la solidaridad, la honestidad, la incomprensión, la indiferencia, etc. Muy recomendable. 4.5 de 5."

He lives an orderly life, inspecting his property each morning, maintaining a clean home, fixing little things before they become big problems, and keeping his distance from all the “idiots” around him. Then a family with two young daughters move in across the street, flattening Ove’s mailbox with their U-haul, and his ordered life becomes distinctly disordered.What a joy this book is! I laughed aloud so often, and I felt for Ove’s loneliness as a child, as a young man, and as a mature man. I also rejoiced at his triumphs, and marveled at his strength of character. I worried about him and cheered him on. I absolutely fell in love with Ove, and was teary-eyed at the end.Backman peoples the novel with an assortment of quirky characters: Patrick (who can’t back up with a trailer), Jimmy (the overweight boy next door who is an IT specialist), Anders (with the crazy girlfriend), Mirsad (the gay barrista), Adrian (the ragged youth who wants to fix his “soon-to-be” girlfriend’s bike), and Rune (his oldest friend, with whom Ove has been feuding for over a decade). About the only normal people are the women: Sonja (Ove’s wife), Anita (Rune’s wife and Sonja’s best friend), Lena (a journalist) and Parvaneh (Patrick’s wife, and Ove’s neighbor). Together they form a community, and despite himself, Ove joins with them.George Newbern does a wonderful job narrating the audiobook. He brings these very different characters to life, giving each a unique voice. If I didn’t have to return it to the library, I’d start listening all over again. "

The book is very cinematic and I'm eager to see the characters come to life!Losing a beloved spouse of many years is my worst nightmare so I could really relate to what Ove was going through.I loved the chapter where the author states... ""all people at root are time optimists. We always think there's enough time to do things with other people. Time to say things to them."" I really relate to this having recently lost my mother-in-law and a cousin. My cousin died suddenly and I've thought more than once that I should have called her and now of course it's too late. This book is full of life lessons like that. But I also loved the humor in it and smiled several times at Ove's antics. In short, A Man Called Ove is a very special novel and one I won't soon forget. I checked it out of the library but since I liked it so much, I may go out and buy a copy. Which for me is high praise indeed!  "

Все пак в нея няма нищо реално и практическо, защото човек като главния герой би бил приеман от околните като абсолютен аутист и колкото и да им помага, никога няма да го харесват и приемат. А аз знам това, защото дядо ми беше горе-долу като него - добър, свръх работлив, готов да помогне на всеки, даваше душата си и буквално залъка от устата си вадеше за децата и цялото семейство.

If you can get through this book without shedding tears of mirth and tears of sorrow, you are emotionally stronger than me. The book is funny, sad, uplifting and thought provoking. Somehow the author weaves a comical cat into it, too. I will never judge grumpy old men poorly again.

314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8173171-diane,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is a treasure. I was in a reading slump when I began this book, but Ove kept bringing me back. Ove is the grumpy old man that you are thankful to get away from when you meet him in a short, superficial sort of way. Especially if you are doing something wrong (or that Ove deems as wrong) and he yells at you. The secret is, underneath it all, Ove is amazing. Ove is not the only phenomenal thing about this book; I loved the writing style. When I was expecting it the least,the author would knock the wind out of me. The author would tell just a bit of the end of the story at the beginning of the book (or chapter). It was not until later that the reader would get all the pieces of the puzzle. Oh, then when those pieces all fit together, my heart would drop into my stomach and tears would immediately spring into my eyes. I cannot count how many times I laughed and cried in this book (sometimes at the same time!). I am trying not to give too much away in this review because I went into this book blind and I think that made it all the more enjoyable. The only downside was that I had a hard time reading more than a few chapters at a time. This may just be because I found the book so heart wrenching. I understand Ove and how he thinks. I am married to a mild version of Ove (although it is Ford, not Saab for my husband).All I can say is, I began this book with skepticism and then ended it with my mind blown and tears streaming down my face. I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to get to know Ove. "

I gave it to my husband to read once I finished it, and it lay neglected in his tbr pile. I would periodically ask him about it, but he would just mumble or put me off. Finally, last fall, he started it, and then lost it somewhere. I kept looking for it, but no joy. So, once I realized it was truly gone somewhere, I ordered a pristine used copy and gave it to him. He had just finished Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine and loved it, more and more as it went on, & I said read “Ove”. I knew he would identify with him in someways, he is a soft-hearted curmudgeon beneath a quiet exterior, and Ove would appeal to him, as would all of the people pulling him out of himself in the village. He started it this weekend & I basically lost him to the book once he got 1/3 of the wayin. He started trying to get info out of me about what happens to Ove, but I would not tell him. This morning he was buried behind the book cover & I said “I knew you would like Ove” and from behind the book he said in a snuffly voice, “I don’t like it”...& when I poked at him and said “You don’t like it so much you won’t come out from behind it to talk to your wife” he lowered the book & I saw his face was covered in tears. It takes a lot to get through his armor, this book reached him. Very highly recommended. "

There was nothing I didn't like about this book was light then serious at other points as the story went along, its a pity that there is not more people like Ove in this world.Ove is a grumpy old man who likes things done right doesn't like his neighbours thinks their idiots even the shop assistants talk to him in another language, until he meets the woman who he spends the rest of his life with Sonja, people don't see what she sees in him, the story then follows the undying love they share for each other.Ove is also good with his hands he builds things for Sonja which she adores because Ove built them there is so much more to Ove than people think I found the story beautifully written & well crafted in the end I was crying that's how much Ove affected me during the book, I am just lost for words Ove is my hero.I also liked how the chapters were written so you could follow the story better I think if it were just the norm it would have been harder to follow I just love Ove & Sonja's everlasting love story right throughout oh what more can I say was just so beautiful."

I must admit, I was expecting more from this book. This book contains a series of short stories that all flow into one, and they are all based on the daily occurrences of a man called Ove. The problem with this, is that it was predictable. I knew what was coming, and I suppose that ruined the story a little. I actually have known a few people with a rather similar character to Ove, and in reality, they are very difficult people to get along with. Ove was a difficult character to like at times. Yes, I did feel for him at particular stages of the book, I'm not entirely cold-hearted, but, for the most part, he was tremendously bitter. The character development was adequate, I thought, but for me to feel attached to any of the characters, there definitely needed to be more. The writing itself, was medicore. It wasn't beautiful or anything, but it was readable and simple to understand.I do think the concept of this book was well thought out, but, unfortunately for me, it was all quite predictable. Maybe you need to be in the right kind of mood for this one. "

328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7597429-harry,Rating 5 out of 5,"Book ReviewMost of my GR friends know that I review crime novels and within those reviews there are a lot of Scandi crimes.  It isn't that I don't read other genres, non-fiction, or other books.  I do.  I like to stay informed and inform my own opinion from what is opined elsewhere: whether that be prose or poetry, journalism or literature, film or television, fact or fiction, as well as the scholarly and the unscholarly.  But when it comes to reviewing fiction here on GR?  I do crime.  Particularly Scandi crime because in general these authors like to use the vehicle to inform on psychological, social and political issues.  What would the book The The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo be without Lisbeth Salander! And how powerful is that character were it not for Larsson's focus on the Swedish foster care system and sexual abuse? Where would Anne Holt’s novels be without the psychological emphasis on characterization, human sexuality and the failures of the Norwegian legal system? A while ago, a GR friend of mine wrote me and recommended a book to me.  She is aware of my penchant for Nordic crime, knew this wasn't a book I would normally review - A Man Called Ove is not a crime story - but insisted I should read this, quite passionately, I might add.  Here is where to go if you are interested in her in-depth and lovely review.It took me a while to get to reading this book.  It sat on my Kindle and I kept skipping it for crime novels, some good, some not ( did I mention I'm hopelessly behind in my reviews?) or reading political blogs. And then finally I exhausted everything else on my Kindle.  And there it was: A Man Called Ove; my friend's recommendation; stubborn and alone; the only one left on my list. I opened it on my Kindle with a healthy dose of curiosity and a certain measure of guilt for not getting to this sooner.Before I started reading, I took a quick look at the GR stats for this one. It’s not often that a book on GR gets a 4.31 star rating (out of 10,411 readers). I read a few of the reviews and quickly saw that essentially people liked the book for similar reasons: they could laugh at, they could feel sad for, they could hate, and they could love a man called Ove, a crusty, ill-tempered old man (Note: I did not use the word “curmudgeon”!) :-)And so I began reading. By the way, this book’s an easy read, you can put it down often and jump right back into it. The structure is one of short chapters that take you to the present and back in time without missing a beat. Being of similar age to Ove I was transfixed from the start by Ove’s observations on Swedish society (not so dissimilar from our own) as seen through the lens of a man entering old age. I found it delightful to read a Scandi book with obvious comical insights that you don’t often see in Scandi crime novels which tend to be more cold and dispiriting. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I think this is the reason my friend wanted me to read this book.It did not escape me that this book contains a wealth of commentary on what we have gained and subsequently lost in today’s society. Beneath the hilarity of Ove’s adventures lies a deep sadness that captures the imagination of the reader as they too feel a measure of loss. If you are a young reader, you are confronted with Ove’s world with which you are unfamiliar, a world in which values and principles are indisputable and ingrained in concrete: a world that is black and white. Clearly, for this young reader this is the comic antithesis of the world in which he or she lives in today: a world of relativity, subjectivism, and where facts are made malleable enough to support one’s view of it. If you are an older reader, as I am, you are confronted by a time that you too have been fortunate enough to witness, a time long gone. For this reader, the comic and tragic mesh together within Ove’s escapades and evoke a certain sense of sadness brilliantly captured by the author’s prose.Throughout the course of the novel what every reader eventually experiences is a metamorphosis where in the beginning one thoroughly dislikes Ove - his crustiness, his seeming rude manner, his apparent disdain for mankind - only to eventually come to feel a deep compassion and love for this man. Parvaneh, who has moved into Ove’s neighborhood and who is an Iranian woman married to an IT professional has set her sights on the thoroughly ill-tempered Ove as being a worthy cause. Like Ove’s deceased wife whom friends thought it unwise of her to marry the dogged Ove, Parvaneh sees something in Ove that is priceless. Ove becomes Parvaneh’s mission in life, as is exemplified in the following passage where she accompanies Ove to the doctor, who says:
”Ove has a heart problem…” he begins in an anodyne voice, following this up with a series of terms that no human being with less than ten years of medical training or an entirely unhealthy addiction to certain television series could ever be expected to understand.When Parvaneh gives him a look studded with a long line of question marks and exclamation marks, the doctor sighs again in that way young doctors with glasses and plastic slippers and a stick up their ass often do when confronted by people who do not even have the common decency to attend medical school before they come to the hospital.“His heart is too big,” the doctor states crassly.Parvaneh stares blankly at him for a very long time. And then she looks at Ove in the bed, in a very searching way. And then she looks at the doctor again as if she’s waiting for him to throw out his arms and start making jazzy movements with his fingers and crying out: “Only joking!”And when he doesn’t do this she starts to laugh. First it’s more like a cough, then as if she’s holding back a sneeze, and before long it’s a long, sustained, raucous bout of giggling. She holds on to the side of the bed, waves her hand in front of her face as if to fan herself into stopping, but it doesn’t help. And then at last it turns into one loud, long-drawn belly laugh that bursts out of the room and makes the nurses in the corridor stick their heads through the door and ask in wonder, “What’s going on here?”“You see what I have to put up with?” Ove hisses wearily at the doctor, rolling his eyes while Parvaneh, overwhelmed by hysterics, buries her face in one of the pillows.

Parvaneh, of course, is embracing the juxtaposition presented throughout the book. In spite of the news that Ove suffers from a serious heart condition, it does not escape her that the prognosis is also exactly what she loves about Ove: that he has a huge heart, a heart of gold. Read this book. Embrace that comedy and tragedy can indeed be intertwined in a thoroughly heartfelt way. Read A Man Called Ove and relish what this book provides: tears and peals of laughter all at once."

Jedenfalls nicht für einen Mann namens Ove. Einen Mann, der Ehrlichkeit und Prinzipientreue schätzt und für Small Talk und Bürokratie nichts übrig hat. Der seiner Frau (und seiner Automarke) immer treu geblieben ist und keinen Grund dafür sehen kann warum man das anders handhaben sollte. Der nicht versteht, warum die Menschen heute nur noch zur Arbeit gehen, mit dem Ziel bald Pause oder Feierabend zu machen, warum niemand mehr in der Lage ist, selbst ein Loch in die Wand zu bohren oder warum verdammt noch mal so ein Computer, der noch nicht einmal eine Tastatur hat, so viel Geld kosten soll.Ove ist sich sicher, nur noch von Idioten umgeben zu sein, die weiße Hemden tragen und Audi oder BMW oder Gott weiß was fahren. Die einen Handwerker anrufen, wenn eine Glühbirne gewechselt werden muss. Die weiße Handys mit Obst auf der Rückseite besitzen, zu blöd sind mit einem Anhänger rückwärts einzuparken und keine Verkehrs- oder Verbotsschilder lesen können.Kurz gesagt, Ove hat die Schnauze voll. Aber die Welt war nicht immer nur voller Idioten. Und Ove war zwar schon immer Ove aber als seine Frau noch da war, ist trotzdem alles irgendwie anders gewesen.Fredrik Backman nimmt uns mit auf eine Reise in Oves Vergangenheit und die kleinen und großen Herausforderungen seines Hier und Jetzt.Er hat ein Buch mit lebendigen Charakteren geschrieben (doch eine Gemeinsamkeit mit Beartown). Ein Buch, das den Leser zum Lachen und Weinen bringen kann. Ein Buch, das einem irgendwie wieder die Augen für das Wesentliche öffnet.Ein Buch über Freundschaft und Liebe und über das Leben und den Tod.Ich kann übrigens das hervorragende Hörbuch wirklich wärmstens empfehlen.Allerdings sollte man damit klar kommen, komische Blicke zu ernten, wenn man an der Ampel oder auf der Autobahn mal wieder einen Lachkrampf bekommt.Davon hatte ich jedenfalls einige.4,5 Sterne, die ich in diesem Fall gerne aufrunde.*******A heartwarming story about an older man that doesn’t quite understand how today’s world is working exactly. Or maybe he understands the how. But certainly not the why.I first learned about Fredrik Backman thanks to Goodreads and his wonderful novel  Beartown. This one here, of course, is his most well-known novel. But I probably wouldn’t have picked it up, if it weren’t for  Beartown. That would have been a mistake. These two books are worlds apart, in terms of content and also in terms of tone. But both are beautifully written. And both I rate amongst my favorites. A Man Called Ove is a sometimes very sad story. But mainly it’s a hilariously funny one. And it’s always very true-to-life.But in many regards life doesn’t make a whole lot of sense nowadays. At least not for a man called Ove. A man that values honesty and people being true to their principles. A man that has no use for small talk and no patience for bureaucracy. A man that has always been faithful to his wife. And to his car brand. He cannot understand why one shouldn’t be. He also does not understand why nowadays people go to work with only one thing in mind, how long it takes for them to get back home. He doesn’t understand why nowadays no one is capable of drilling a simple hole into the wall. And most of all, he does not understand why that goddamn computer costs such an absurd amount of money. And then it doesn’t even have a keyboard!Of one thing Ove is certain. He’s surrounded by idiots. Idiots that wear white shirts and drive Audis or BMWs or God knows what. People that call a craftsman if they have to change a light bulb. People that own such little white phones, with fruit on the back. People that are to dumb to reverse their car properly. Or to read traffic and prohibition signs. In short, Ove is fed up with them. Ove’s fed up with the world.But the world wasn’t always full of idiots. There was a time when things were different. When people were different. Not Ove. Ove has always been Ove. It’s the people around him that are different.Fredrik Backman takes us on a journey into Ove’s past. And also shows us the manifold challenges of Ove’s today. He again wrote a book populated with characters that feel like real people. A book that makes the reader cry, and laugh. A book that opens one’s eyes, for what is really important in life. A book about friendship, and love, and loss. A book about life, and about death.A book that often made me laugh uncontrollably. In public. Thanks, Fredrik! We had a blast. Me and the onlookers.4.5 stars, rounded up. It was almost as good as  Beartown. Almost."
