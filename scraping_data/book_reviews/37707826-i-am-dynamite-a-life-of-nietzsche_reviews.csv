Nici în viață, nici postum. În secolul al XIX-lea, boala de care a suferit nu avea un diagnostic precis. Cît despre remediu nici n-are rost să vorbim. Medicii i-au prescris medicamente, dar majoritatea erau perfect toxice: unguente pe bază de mercur, morfină, ether, picături de bromură etc. Nietzsche a încercat să-și aline suferința cu aceste otrăvuri.În toamna lui 1870, de exemplu, în timpul războiului franco-prusac cînd a lucrat ca infirmier și a căzut bolnav, Nietzsche „a fost tratat cu azotat de argint, opiu și clisme cu acid tanic, tratamentul normal la vremea aceea, al cărui efect era că distrugea intestinele pacientului pe viață” (p.79). Diferiți psihiatri contemporani au încercat să producă un diagnostic retrospectiv, ceea ce e imposibil. Sue Prideaux arată - și cu bun temei - că diagnosticul inițial (paralizie progresivă, indusă de o infecție luetică) a fost dictat, în primul rînd, de moda timpului și mai puțin de simptomele și manifestările pacientului. Medicii l-au tratat, așadar, pe Nietzsche cu maximă neglijență profesională. Într-un sens, era inevitabil. Evoluția de după 1889 a bolnavului infirmă, totuși, paralizia progresivă. Mai mult e greu de spus. Să nu uităm însă că tatăl lui Nietzsche, Carl a murit subit, pe 30 iulie 1849, cînd fiul lui încă nu împlinise 5 ani. În opinia doctorilor, cauza morții pastorului Nietzsche a fost, probabil, o „înmuiere a creierului” (pp.23-25, 335).Neglijență sau neputință profesională? Să vedem. Profesorul Otto Binswanger, directorul Clinicii din Jena (care avea, poate, expertiza necesară pentru a invalida diagnosticul inițial), nu i-a dat prea multă atenție. S-a bizuit pe medicii care l-au examinat prima dată. Deși Nietzsche a stat în ospiciul din Jena 14 luni, Binswanger n-a pus la îndoială verdictul lor, probabil greșit (sifilis terțiar). Mai mult, „În timpul cursurilor lui Binswanger, Nietzsche era folosit, alternativ cu alți pacienți, ca material didactic pentru studenți. El nu percepea acest lucru ca umilitor” (p.288).Este exact ceea ce a făcut și sora lui Nietzsche, Elisabeth Alexandra Förster-Nietzsche, viitoarea admiratoare a lui Hitler, după ce bolnavul a fost adus acasă și a locuit în edificiul din Weimar, construit anume de ea pentru a glorifica geniul lui Nietzsche, dar mai ales propria-i persoană. Își va trata fratele ca pe un exponat prețios: „Lui Elisabeth îi plăcea să-l afișeze după cină. Adesea aranja ca el să fie întrezărit printr-o perdea fumurie, ca un strigoi la o ședință de spiritism” (p.308).Friedrich Nietzsche nu mai era coerent din dimineața zilei de 3 ianuarie 1889, după criza de la Torino. Elisabeth mistifică realitatea și pretinde că, în timpul lungii sale agonii, filosoful discuta adesea cu ea și se consolau reciproc: „Cît de des mă lăuda pentru ce făceam! Cît de des mă liniștea cînd păream tristă! Recunoștința lui era înduioșătoare: De ce plîngi, Lisbeth?, mă întreba. Doar sîntem fericiți” (p.309).Cînd citești aceste elucubrații, te cuprinde scîrba..."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53165-warwick,Rating 4 out of 5,"Nietzsche is now preceded by his reputation to such a monstrous extent that it takes a bit of an effort to overcome all the received wisdom – which in my case was the only wisdom I had, having read only one of his books and virtually nothing else about him. Oh yeah, Nietzsche, wasn't he a bit right-wing? Tooled around with a terrific stare, declaiming things about the death of god? Women hated him, Nazis loved him? Something like that…?He comes across in this fascinating biography as a smart, unusual, and not unkindly figure, but one overmastered by the emotional demands of his family, by an imposed solitariness, and by the lifelong ill health which, he knew, appeared to be leading inexorably to madness.He tried to accustom himself to this possibility early; insanity ran in his family and his father had died young from a ‘softening of the brain’. From the beginning, in his writings, he was ‘exploring the idea of emancipatory insanity and the validity of the irrational’, in passages like this from Daybreak:Ah, give me madness, you heavenly powers! Madness, that I may only at last believe in myself! Give deliriums and convulsions, sudden lights and darkness, terrify me with frost and fire such as no mortal has ever felt, with deafening din and prowling figures, make me howl and whine and crawl like a beast: so that I may come to believe in myself!Well, he got what he wanted. He had a vital personal investment in many of his philosophical ideas, which had to do with turning ‘every “it was” into “I wanted it thus”’ – in other words, with not just accepting the things that happen to you, but forcing yourself to find joy and satisfaction in them. For him, this amor fati could be a big ask.Most of the key locations in his life, as he developed these ideas, were in Switzerland. He took a professorship in Basel at just 24; spent probably the happiest years of his life at Wagner's house on Lake Lucerne, where he wrote The Birth of Tragedy; and later had his most dramatic epiphanies at Sils up in the Engadine (where tourists can still visit the ‘Zarathustra rock’). ‘Here my muses live,’ he said; ‘this region is blood and kin to me and even more than that.’But misfortune did seem to follow him around, and there were very few friends who lasted long. Wagner had originally seen him as a worthy disciple, and the two had a close relationship, but it came apart in a miserable way. Wagner wrote to his doctor, asking whether some of Nietzsche's medical symptoms might not be ‘the effects of masturbation’; this letter somehow got into circulation, and Nietzsche found himself at a party in Bayreuth with everybody reading it surreptitiously and sniggering at him behind his back.With women he had no luck at all. His most affectionate relationship was with Lou Salomé, the Russian-born thinker, writer and itinerant femme fatale. The two shared many long walks and deep conversations which meant a great deal to Nietzsche, but she was always interested in other smart people as well. For a while the two of them resolved to live à trois with the philosopher Paul Rée, but this modern arrangement also ended pathetically: one day, while they were travelling together, Nietzsche woke up to find the other two gone. He carried on to some other destinations on their itinerary, but could not find them; in fact, Salomé and Rée had just stayed where they were and lain low until Nietzsche disappeared.One gets the impression of a seriously lonely man. There's a moment where the Goncourts' journal is published, and Nietzsche reads it and thinks wistfully how nice it must be to have these boozy, friendly dinners with guests like Zola and Turgenev. He would have flourished in that situation. But there he was, wandering around alone on an Alp, having ecstatic visions interspersed with bouts of crying.It is partly for these reasons that his later writings can be, as Sue Prideaux puts it, ‘vengefully misogynistic’. Nevertheless, she says:All his life he valued intelligent women, making close and enduring friendships with them. He only fell in love with clever women – starting with Cosima [Wagner]. He disliked ignorant and bigoted women.Which brings us to his sister, Elisabeth. Nietzsche kept up a friendly correspondence with her, but he did not share her values: she was an ardent nationalist and a vicious antisemite, whereas Nietzsche considered himself a ‘bad German’ but a ‘very good European’. (He gave up his German citizenship to work in Basel, and remained officially stateless for the rest of his life.)The rift between them became serious when Elisabeth married the nationalist activist Bernhard Förster. ‘I do not have his enthusiasm for “things German”,’ Nietzsche wrote to her, ‘and even less for keeping this “glorious” race pure. On the contrary, on the contrary—’ (Nietzsche liked to tell people he was Polish, after someone said his face looked like something from a Matejko painting.)The Försters went off to start a bizarre antisemitic colony in Paraguay, but after her husband, deep in debt, finally killed himself, Elisabeth found a new project in managing the affairs of her brother. Nietzsche by this stage had gone completely la-la. He was signing his letters ‘The Crucified’, and telling correspondents things like, ‘I have ordered a convocation of princes in Rome – I mean to have the young emperor shot.’If there was a certain élan to his early ideas about the liberating power of madness, there was none whatsoever to the reality: first confined to an asylum, and then long years shuffling around a room above his sister's parlour, scarcely able to remember his name or to speak coherently. Elisabeth took ownership of all his writings, copyrights and letters, and carefully controlled what would be released to researchers or the public.But even the sadness of Nietzsche's final years is overshadowed by what was done to his reputation after he died. Elisabeth, in Prideaux's telling, was determined to turn her brother's writings to her own ideological ends – which by now had a political correlative. Giving a speech at a festival held to commemorate fifty years since Wagner's death, she announced: ‘We are drunk with enthusiasm because at the head of our government stands such a wonderful, indeed phenomenal, personality like our magnificent Chancellor Adolf Hitler. Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Führer.’The Nietzsche-Archiv, which she built and managed in Weimar, was soon stuffed with fellow believers. ‘Inside the Archive, everyone, from the doorkeeper to the head, is a Nazi,’ said one depressed disciple of Nietzsche's, who later fled into exile. ‘It is enough to make one weep…. Mysterious, incomprehensible Germany.’Despite the superficial appeal of Nietzsche's terminology – the ‘blond beasts’, the ‘master race’ – it was not easy to jam his ideas into a fascist mould. As one leading Nazi ideologue commented: ‘If not for the fact that Nietzsche was not a nationalist or a socialist, and did not believe in race discrimination, he would have made a good Nazi.’I am not up on Nietzsche scholarship so I don't know how controversial or un- this story is, but certainly here Nietzsche emerges as a figure deeply sympathetic, deeply troubled, and deeply misunderstood by posterity. It's a very sad tale, so one is grateful to Prideaux's dry, often openly comic style, which guides you through his life without any unnecessary drama, letting the facts speak for themselves.‘Deutschland, Deutschland über Alles,’ he wrote scornfully, ‘I'm afraid that was the end of German philosophy.’ Unfortunately, it was just the start for ‘Nietzschean’ philosophy, and for a lot of people it's never recovered. It all makes for a completely riveting and desperately sad read."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat,No Rating,"Great fun. A very lively book, with some dramatic passages. Perhaps it is slightly awkward that Nietzsche was much less colourful than the people he interacted with, so the shining stars of this biography are the Wagners  both of Cosima Wagner's husbands married her apparently because she looked very much like her father, the composer Liszt , Lou Salome, Strindberg, and even Nietzsche's sister who on account of being the unpleasant kind of person that you would not want to be acquainted with in real life - is very interesting to read about.I am not sure if this is a great book for getting close to Nietzsche's thinking and ideas, but according to Prideaux, he said that all philosophy is autobiography, and the book pursues that as it's approach. Perhaps Nietzsche was not very forth coming in his correspondence, or interesting enough in person to merit insightful details recorded in other people's diaries, but I was surprised by the weight that Prideaux gave to Lou Salome's recollections twelve years later (if I remember correctly) of conversations with Nietzsche about his philosophy, particularly since Salome had strong opinions of her own - so is she really recalling Nietzsche's views or what resonated and was similar to her own thinking?Nietzsche himself was changing or developing his ideas, in some cases he may have been playful or provocative, and ultimately he did go spectacularly mad in Turin in 1888/9, so one can also assume that that some of his ideas are symptoms of his mental breakdown as Prideaux implies for example his condemnation of coffee drinking at about the same time as he was writing in his letters in praise of Turin coffee coffee is available in other cities and may or may not be of similar importance to both philosophers and non-philosophers .For Salome, Nietzsche was in search of a divine replacement for the Christian God, probably a revived Dionysus, the reason for this was that Nietzsche was too interested in having more sex and was therefore overly interested in Dionysian orgiastic rites. Salome was to become, eventually a promoter of Nietzsche's work, although in the early 1880s when they were friends and Nietzsche was planning that he and her and a mutual friend would live together, Salome and the friend hid from Nietzsche before catching a train to Berlin. Salome at that stage of her life was disinclined to sex on account of recently having been sexually assaulted by her tutor (she was only 21 when she met Nietzsche), later she married - her husband proposed by stabbing himself and threatening suicide - but she reserved sex only for an extra marital affair  her and Nietzsche's mutual friend Paul Ree was not involved in this as he was gay, all of which illustrated for me that Nietzsche was not the most interesting person this Nietzsche biography  Salome went on to be a muse to Rilke before joining Sigmund Freud and becoming an early psychoanalyst.I wondered if Nietzsche's significance was in thinking new provocative thoughts, or in articulating what his contemporaries felt but were not able to put into words. His belief in the death of God and search for some alternative and occasional longing for new culturally unifying myths (originally Wagnerian opera seemed to fulfil this role for him, but later in life he preferred Bizet's Carmen) seems to belong more to the latter than the former, perhaps because his generation shared similar experiences of losing faith, though in line with all philosophy being autobiography, it feels significant that Nietzsche's father died when his son was four years old, later in life both Richard Wagner  coincidentally a distant cousin  as I recall from a complex family tree at the Nietzsche museum in Naumburg and Jakob Burckhardt seem to have been father figures for Nietzsche (who Oedipally turned against Wagner).I found the take up and spread of Nietzsche's ideas the most interesting aspect  apart from the multi-coloured people who were not Nietzsche but this came about late in his life and isn't a focus of Prideaux's book, Strindberg was an early fan (via the Danish critic Georg Brandes  he was like several of Nietzsche's early supporters Jewish who interested Edward Munch in Nietzsche, Nietzsche asked Strindberg to translate his books into French, however the tenor of their correspondence led Strindberg to think that Nietzsche was already mad.Nietzsche himself is a curiously quiet presence in his own biography, extremely short-sighted with sensitive eyes, he was happy walking in mountain landscapes - he grew a bushy moustache to intimidate people and prevent them from talking to him which seems mostly to have been effective, he had a stellar academic career (he was offered a post as a Professor before he had graduated from university) which he grew rapidly sick of, he struggled with an early typewriter and eventually found music to have too overwhelmingly powerful an effect on him - as though he feared it would turn him into a Manchurian candidate.Brandes described Nietzsche as an Aristocratic Radical, a description which delighted him and encompasses his dislike of the politics of the German Second Empire, opposition to anti-Semitism, opposition to the Christian Church, and fairly elitist views. Still, a brilliant and colourful read.He seems in places the father of the contemporary and even the banal - he was a fan of practising gratitude for a while, his stumbling blocks in this were his mother and his sister who he struggled at times to be positive about. Much of his thinking seemed to me a response to Straus' Life of Jesus - which also had a huge affect on George Elliot, this was peculiarly significant as he was the son of a Priest and his mother hoped (prompted? urged? expected? ) that Nietzsche too would become a Priest, the death of God and the rejection of Christianity then was a statement about a personal longing for liberation as much as a philosophical or sociological statement, and as one might expect from a son of the manse and a person saturated in nineteenth century education he rather over states the impact on Christian values on European societies  but then in my view in terms of attitudes, law or social structure European societies are mostly pre-Christian in terms of Gospel teachings, there's not much evidence of turning the other cheek, or of the sinless throwing the first stone, though arguably after 1945 there has been some modest sharing of loaves and fishes. Nietzsche strikes me as an interesting contrasts to Simone Weil. Both had a similarly intense response to ancient Greek culture, but took opposite views to Christianity, Weil embraces faith ever more powerfully while at the same time being socially more radical than Nietzsche while he positioned himself in search of some other faith which he did not seem to find.

3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/974210-erik-graff,Rating 5 out of 5,"When asked for recommendations by those unversed in philosophy I most commonly recommend Plato and Nietzsche. Both are enduringly popular. Both are immediately accessible. Though often misinterpreted, both also describe the antipodes of Western philosophy: the metaphysical and the anti-metaphysical, the classical religious and the modern secular ideals.As the Church has misappropriated Plato for its purposes, so much of the abuse of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) stemmed from the decades of control of his estate by his racist sister Elisabeth (1846-1935) and her increasingly Nazi entourage. This has been substantially rectified for American readers by the republication of his works, unsullied by her self-serving ministrations, by such translators and biographers as W. Kaufmann and R.J. Hollingdale. Now, with S. Prideaux's current biography, such reconstructions of this man have attained a greater completeness.While Kaufmann, the one most responsible for the reintroduction of Nietzsche to the English-reading public, produced a magisterial biography of the philosopher in 1950 (rev. 1968), his emphasis was more on the evolution of Nietzsche's writing and ideas. Prideaux's particular virtue is in having provided a very readable and more fully-fleshed portrait of the man and those closest to him. She is particularly strong in providing a lucid exposition of his intellectual development in relation to his physical condition and erotic life without thereby belittling either the man or his work.Where Prideaux is weak is in placing Nietzsche within his philosophical context, neglecting, I think his dependence, via Schopenhauer and others, on Kant. But this is the objection of a philosophically-inclined reader and hers is first and foremost a biography, a very good one, which should appeal to specialists and generalists alike."

5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13298726-michael-perkins,Rating 4 out of 5,"Fabulous essay by Christopher Hitchens about Nietzsche...https://archive.vanityfair.com/articl...===============The author explains the origins of Zarathustra....Why did Nietzsche choose Zarathustra? Zarathustra, also called Zoroaster, was a Persian prophet who probably lived some time between the twelfth and sixth centuries before Christ. Zarathustra presented a key to the problem of evil that could never be answered by Judaism, Christianity or Islam, whose all-powerful gods were all-good. In Zoroastrianism the god of light is in constant conflict with the god of darkness and evil. At the end of time, the god of light will score a final victory, but until then he is not in control of events. Consequently, Zoroastrianism, unlike the three great religions of the book, escapes the paradox of an all-powerful good God who is responsible for what many people take to be unnecessary evil.Zarathustra’s ten years of solitude in the mountains between the ages of thirty and forty might stand for Nietzsche’s post-Basel decade of independent thinking, which was often conducted on high mountains. Zarathustra is forty, the same age as the writer Nietzsche is, when he comes down “to be among the people.” He carries down fire, as Prometheus had carried the fire that would transform cultures and civilizations and as the Holy Ghost had carried down tongues of fire at Pentecost. Fire bestows upon the chosen ones (the enlightened ones) the gift of “speaking in tongues,” i.e. in words that are universally comprehensible. It is a synonym for wisdom and for revelation. Zarathustra’s fire has the specific ability to scorch meaning into the meaninglessness of life following upon the death of God. His mouth alone (through Nietzsche’s) will be the first to address the nihilism, despair and devaluation of moral life that was reaching its crisis within the context of nineteenth-century materialism. At the end of his book he writes:  ""Dead are all gods: now we want the Übermensch to live---Thus spoke Zarathustra.”He sent it to his publisher describing it in his cover letter as “a fifth gospel.”=========In 1888, Kaiser Wilhelm I had died at last, at the age of ninety. Seventeen years previously, he had accepted the German crown in the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles, to Nietzsche’s great distress and fear for the imbalance of Europe. In the intervening years, the Kaiser and his Iron Chancellor Bismarck had famously forged the archconservative and repressive Second Reich on industrialization, capitalism, unscrupulous expansionism, the Protestant Church, artistic conservatism and censorship. ""All this had coagulated into one massive, congested, sclerotic, nationalist, repressive and authoritarian world power— as Nietzsche had feared would happen.""As a university student in the late 1880s and early ’90s, Harry Kessler [executor Nietzsche’s literary estate] was part of “the Raskolnikov generation”: those on whom Dostoyevsky’s novel Crime and Punishment had a profound effect. Kessler served as witness at the trial of a highborn fellow student who shot and killed his working-class girlfriend, after which the murderer failed to kill himself because his shot into his own chest was not well aimed. It was a nihilist act inspired by Dostoyevsky’s book, which made an unquantifiable impression on the first post-Christian despairing generation. A rash of such murders among students overcome by “the great disgust,” the will to nothingness, became known as “the Raskolnikov effect” after the anti-hero in Dostoyevsky’s book.Three years after leaving university, Kessler felt able to write, “There is probably no twenty-to-thirty-year-old tolerably educated man in Germany today who does not owe to Nietzsche a part of his worldview, or has not been more or less influenced by him...""1893 became an important year during which Nietzsche’s work caught on with the artistic avant-garde of both Berlin and Paris to wide effect through painting, playwriting, poetry and music. Scandinavians also set the Nietzschean fire.This would have been astonishing enough to Nietzsche, who had so often expressed his horror at the idea of having disciples, but the political tenor of the Nietzsche cult would have horrified him further still. ""The approach of the First World War gave impetus to a bellicose form of Nietzscheism that took the will to power as a moral teaching sanctioning violence and ruthlessness, the Übermensch as the greatest brute, and the blond beast as an incentive toward a racial breeding program.""Newspaper articles by Nietzsche's anti-Semitic, fascist sister, Elizabeth, encouraged these twisted interpretations, enthusiastically describing her brother as a friend of war.His sister, along with her anti-Semitic husband, gathered together out of context fragments from Nietzsche's notebooks, adding their own ideas as if they were his, into a volume titled ""Triumph of the Will"" with Nietzsche identified as the author on the cover and the title page. This book was eagerly adopted by Mussolini as a justification for his fascist nationalism and thirst for war. In Germany, the Weimar period was a gestation period of this work. Hitler and the Nazis became admirers of both the book and Elizabeth. Philosopher Oswald Spengler made things worse by incorporating Social Darwinism into the alleged beliefs of Nietzsche. The misunderstood terms Übermensch and “master morality” served Spengler's purpose.Soon after philosopher Martin Heidegger joined the Nazi Party, the notorious German professor, Alfred Bäumler, who had issued a new edition of ""The Triumph of the Will,"" oversaw the first book burning in Berlin. A film, directed by Leni Riefenstah, of the 1934 Nuremberg Rally was titled ""Triumph of the Will"" as a nod to the influence of the book. Of course, Hitler never actually read any Nietzsche, including the phony ""Triumph of the Will,"" but simply saw it as useful propaganda. On her deathbed in 1935, Elizabeth had Hitler's ""Mein Kampf"" read to her aloud. Hitler attended her funeral."

All the elements must be gently pulled in so the main themes can shine through. Prideaux accomplishes this with such great finesse. Essentially, this book has 3 main threads that she stays true to for the entire biography: *Chronology of Nietzsche's Life, filled with colourful details.*An Intellectual History of his Philosophical Development, flooded with bookish details.*Historical Context as it Relates to Nietzsche, with the goal of setting the record straight.We can see Nietzsche develop from his early 20's. True to any young man, this section of the book is the most lively and fastest to read. The early pages are packed with books he read, what he thought of them, his keen friendship with Wagner & his musical life.Next, the biography moves into his middle years, where the intellectual development slows down but his private life certainly picks up. He's essentially come into his own for what he believes in. The rest reads like a, well, not a gossipy newspaper column. He's still a great thinker, Prideaux's writing still sings, perhaps he's simply a man who fell in love? And if this biography reads as beautifully as fiction, our villain is clearly moving onto the chessboard.This final section is where I was rendered on the floor in emotional turmoil. Again, Prideaux's writing keeps the more complex periods of history clear & easy to read. Which only emphasizes the tragedy of thoughts gone wrong. These were an emotionally crippling couple of pages with exquisitely concise summaries of Nietzsche's final self published works. She includes spoilers on these few pages, if you consider lines like Descartes' ""I Think Therefore, I Am"" to be a spoiler.The final pages include: *Aphorisms as a great tribute. *Near year by year Chronology from 1844-1935*Endnotes citing the sources, little to no commentary*A pretty fun sounding Bibliography for book nerdsI'd recommend this to fans of Nietzsche & his naysayers most of all. She reduces him back the mere man he wanted to be, removing the legend that his sister painstakingly tried to build up.

Yet that is the torment of every great teacher of mankind: he knows that, given the circumstances and the accidents, he can become a disaster as well as a blessing to mankind.'"" (374-5)Ironically, Nietzsche wrote these words in a letter to his sister Elizabeth, who, as Prideaux painfully shows, abused her brother and his thought more than anyone else—associating it with Nazi ideology in a manner that echoes to this day. Hopefully, Prideaux's biography will dispel the last, lingering notions that Nietzsche was an anti-Semite and proto-Nazi (already intrepidly addressed by Walter Kaufmann before her). The biography was compelling and surprisingly sad. Poor, misunderstood, ill-fated Nietzsche! Prideaux does a brilliant job of vividly portraying his life; throughout the story (and it does read like a story) you feel as if you're right there alongside Nietzsche, thinking along with him and sharing his troubles.

13,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Nietzsche was the primary philosopher who inspired me to pursue the field. Not that he offers a (coherent) belief system or ready-to-hand tools for life, but he does provide the type of critical perspective necessary to begin questioning one’s life. His thought has so much become a part of my own that whenever I revisit his works I find aphorisms that mirror my own dispositions in ways I never realized had sunk in. I feel, as do many who have been inspired by him, an emotional connection with his thought given which he holds a dear place for me. All that is to say that I was both anxious and apprehensive to read a biography on his person.The task of writing about the life of Nietzsche is not without its perils. With a hankering after the irrational and revelry it is just as vital to capture the setting and atmosphere within which Nietzsche’s thought developed so as to impress the mood that makes up such a part of Nietzsche’s aesthetic. Prideaux does a superb job in recreating the environment that so affected and afflicted this tormented thinker. With Nietzsche’s own penchant for colorful descriptions, Prideaux works hard to maintain a similar flourish without becoming garish. Nor can one write a biography of Nietzsche without addressing the philosophical thought that consumed him. Prideaux adroitly weaves within the story of his life not only Nietzsche’s own thought, but that of the likes of Empedocles, Kant, Schopenhauer, and more in a manner that seems natural and easy to digest. However, I question Prideaux’s choice to give synopses of Nietzsche’s books, particularly those after his Untimely Meditations. Nietzsche’s works are far too broad and nuanced to neatly sum up in a couple of pages and I fear that these sections may mislead the reader into false starts and premature conclusions about his works.What I find most commendable about this biography is that Prideaux does not mythologize unsubstantiated events in Nietzsche’s life, not even those considered pivotal, nor speculate about them other than where it is further noted by contemporaries making up the primary sources consulted. For example, the time in which it is supposed that Nietzsche may have contracted syphilis is passingly commented upon with only a slight reference to Mann’s grander allusions to it in his novel Doctor Faustus. Rather, the book is well researched and is composed with descriptive care to fill in the setting. The historical facts are treated like a pre-composed libretto needing only to be pieced together and then inlayed by the greater orchestral composition that is Prideaux’s text. I imagine that some may be critical of the divagations into other notable individual’s lives, such as Wagner and Förster, but I found these to be sparse and refreshing. Nietzsche lived during an exceptional time (the Paris Commune, the Franco-Prussian War, emergence of Symbolism, etc.) and many of the individuals, both greater and lesser known, he was personally acquainted with. As such, I take these additions to be an asset to the whole in their providing important context to Nietzsche’s acquaintance and reciprocating influence. “Incipit Tragoedia. When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the Lake of Urmi, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and his solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart changed,” begins aphorism 342 of The Gay Science. The same could be said of that fateful day in Turin during the winter of 1889, Incipit Tragoedia, when he finally went under and succumbed to the madness within which he would spend just over the next ten years. His final decade of life is heartbreaking to read about and Prideaux spares no punches in defending his legacy with a detailed account of the (mis)appropriations of his thought. Some may be turned off by the pointed depiction of his sister Elisabeth’s machinations, but Nietzsche’s legacy had ruthlessly been controlled by her and to dire purposes for decades after his death. Prideaux does an excellent job documenting and debunking many false impressions that have been attributed to Nietzsche over the years without, however, denying that his thought does lend itself to such interpretation and abuse. In terms of scholarship and engagement of style, Prideaux’s portrait is masterfully executed and artfully composed to the aim of defending Nietzsche’s legacy as a philosopher of ‘perhaps.’"
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54,Rating 4 out of 5,"I had not read a full biography of Nietzsche before. I had tried to work through some of his major works in college and knew of the odd course that his writings had taken after his death, but lack any sense of a life trajectory. That always struck me as odd for a philosopher/essayist who has proven to be so influential. Sue Prideaux has written a readable and engaging biography of Nietzsche that has helped to fill these holes for me.Having said this, I do not know that I am much clearer about actually “getting” Nietzsche. The book clearly communicates the role of his thought in identifying how modernism has weakened the ability of religion and philosophy to provide meaning and value for people, provided that the levelling tendencies of modern thought are followed through consistently and honestly. That was already fairly clear to me. Prideaux’s account highlights the problem that such a philosophy presents - how does one find meaning in a world with no certainty and no principles - a philosophy of “perhaps”. That this would pose tensions for individuals trying to justify a place in the world is clear and the path that Nietzsche steered through the neighborhoods of madness is not surprising. It was a basic part of his own story line.There are a few aspects to Nietzsche’s story as told here that were striking to me.First, what an odd intellectual environment he worked in! He gets a professorship in philology without completing any degree because of two influential mentors. Then he begins to move in completely different directions away from philology and towards philosophy such that students stop signing up for his courses. He then eventually leaves the university and wanders around Central Europe going to scenic areas writing books that nobody read and whose format was more understandable as driven by his health than by any content. He did not attain much success at all in his lifetime. I have trouble getting my head around just how different this intellectual world is from anything today, especially in big time philosophy.Second, you have to love family, right? How the influence of his mother and especially his sister was associated with Nietzsche’s work is hard to comprehend, especially on substantive issues that affected how his work has been viewed since his death (antisemitism). It is hard to see how his legacy could have not been confused given the particularities of his estate and its managers.Third, the limitations of 19th century medicine are striking and one wonders what was really going on, both in terms of his inherited physical disorders and the bizarre treatments he received. The link between the social/cultural and physical aspects of insanity are striking.Fourth, he received virtually no recognition during his lifetime (when he would have been sane enough to recognize it). Add to that the shift in intellectual life at the turn of the century and it seems like a bad joke on the part of the gods at Nietzsche’s expense. Throw in WW1 and the Nazis and the story only gets stranger. The strange relationship with Wagner and his mistress is part of this and a separate strange part of the cultural story.Finally, the book makes me want to tour Switzerland and northern Italy. I had actually visited Basel and Lucerne prior to reading the book and now want to go back.This was a fun book to read, even while trying to sort through Nietzsche’s aphorisms."
15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6243880-gary-beauregard-bottomley,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’m glad I broke my rule against biographies and read this book. I needed a context and continuity for properly understanding Nietzsche, and this biography gave it to me. I generally don’t like biographies because as Nietzsche said about thought since Socrates it’s just a collection of facts, or in my words like stamp collecting, and biographies often miss the cohesion by dwelling on the facts or describing a person’s life as if they were stamps in a collection isolated from the real world. This biography provided the necessary cohesion and gives the reader enough of a taste for why Nietzsche's thoughts are relevant today.This biographer broke from a collection of facts by linking Nietzsche’s thought with his life by dissecting his writing as he was becoming through his life. Nietzsche is a poet who wrote in prose and aphorisms. Nietzsche writes his feelings with ideas such that others can open their eyes rather than remaining blind. That to me is a definition of a poet. I would even give Nietzsche the compliment of not being a philosopher, because Nietzsche can be understood and the definition of a philosopher almost certainly has ‘not being understandable by regular people’ in its definition (okay, I’m just kidding), and this biography goes a long way towards explaining what Nietzsche thought and why it’s just as important to today.Nietzsche was barely known throughout his sane period of life. Almost from the point he lost his sanity is when his fame started to blossom. Nietzsche was incredibly anti anti-Semite. The biographer gives ample evidence for that. More importantly, and this is where the biography excels, once ‘God is dead’ where do we get our meaning? Nietzsche has a project and within a series of books that sell 100 or so copies per book during his sane lifetime he resolves that question, and not to ruin it for anyone, his answer is thrown back to his readers; it is for you to find your meaning. In Nietzsche’s ‘Ecce Homo’, one of the few autobiographies worth reading, he’ll say ‘I gave them the bait, but they refused to nibble’. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone. I know I’ll continue my mission of reading more works of Nietzsche, but now I’ll understand the context and the meaning a little bit better than I would have if I had not read this biography. As Nietzsche said, ‘no one strives for happiness, except for an Englishman’; our real striving is for our meaning not the transitory feelings of happiness."

Never was such advice followed so assiduously as it was by Nietzsche who, if Sue Prideaux's book is to believed, managed to spend his entire existence without encountering a single episode of adventure or excitement. Sure, there are adventures of the mind, of familial and emotional turmoil, of intellectual conflict and dialectic, but by and large his life seems to have been one of comfort, conformity, and contemplation, be it walking in the mountains or reclining in drawing rooms of the genteel. Of course, one can hardly blame Sue Prideaux if Nietzsche led such a mundane and tedious existence, but by bringing Nietzsche down to earth and showing how even his earth-shattering philosophy was so closely connected to his personal life, loves, and rivalries, she manages to underplay her own hand, subverting the ""dynamite"" metaphor of the title to reveal a Nietzsche all too human.

First, man must become himself. Secondly, amor fati; he must accept what life brings, avoiding the blind alleys of self-hatred and ressentiment. Then finally man can overcome himself to find true fulfilment as the ubermensch, the man at peace with himself, finding joy in his earthly purpose, rejoicing in the sheer magnificence of existence and content with the finitude of his mortality. Tragically for Nietzsche, the need to overcome ourselves became so blatantly distorted into the need to overcome others that it has tended to overshadow his ability to ask the eternal questions in such a gloriously provocative way. Similarly, his devotion to examining every facet of the truth and never recommending an answer beyond 'perhaps...' has afforded infinite potential for interpretation. ""  [p376]This is a very clear and straighforward account of Nietzsche's life and writings, in chronological order. It provides reviews of his many books and key points from his developing philosophy in terms that are uncomplicated and accessible; it also emphasizes the extent to which his books incorporate biographical material and require a knowledge of the writer before the work can be understood. ""When the book was finished, he found himself astonished at how autobiographical the text was. It took him by surprise to see how his own blood dripped from the pages, but he felt cetain that only he would be able to see it. In his next book he was to pursue the idea that all philosophy (not only his own) was autobiography."" [p240]It gives a lengthy account of his dealings with Wagner, and explains very well the perverse impact on his reputation of his viciously anti-semitic sister and the Nazis, who controlled and misrepresented his unpublished writings for many years. This is essential as his reputation has been so sullied and his writing so misrepresented because of these associations that anyone approaching his work must first push their way through this barrier and only then hope to give the writing itself a fair hearing. I think for many people this is going to be an excellent introduction to Nietzsche and will hopefully encourage them to go further and read some of his books."

The life part never seemed to get close enough to him, and the thought was just too far away. That he was taken to a brothel and played piano there, that he probably didn't have syphilis, and that Wagner wrote a letter to his doctor which seemed to have led to the breakdown in their friendship are not really tidbits.

Of course, Wagner and wife Cosima are worth a few dozen books on their own, but this tale does a good job of showing their personal and artistic interactions. Throw in “Mad” King Ludwig II of Bavaria, who financed much of Wagner’s works and you have quite the cast. They both knew they were geniuses, and had no trouble reminding each other of that fact. Nietzsche had fluttering palpitations when listening to Wagner’s operas and Wagner insisted intellectuals appreciate Nietzsche’s writings. They idolized each other artistically, but things got rough at times as Wagner and wife were keenly nationalistic and anti-semitic whereas Nietzsche was the opposite. Aware of Nietzsche’s ‘bad boy of philosophers’ image, I read his major works back in my self education days and pretended like some of it soaked in, so it was somewhat a relief to see the big thinkers of his day tell him, “I like your work”, and more often - “I hate your work”, “but not sure I understand it”. So I am in good company. Nietzsche is known for his witty-sayings...aphorisms, and it was interesting to learn that was the writing style in those days, everyone tried to fill a book full of short deep, meaningful thoughts. Ironically, he published his most famous, popular and money making works just before he went totally insane, which was probably caused by the long term effects of syphilis, which 'softens the brain'. Yet another wild character of the times, his uber-nationalistic, swindling, tyrannical sister, Elizabeth, stepped in to care for him in his last 11 years while he was becoming a world famous philosopher, without realizing it. Long after Wagner and Nietzsche both had passed away, Cosima Wagner and Elisabeth both became grand-dames of sorts to the Third Reich. Wagner’s works and politics were more easily adapted to the Nazi philosophy, however Elisabeth worked hard to ensure her brother’s ideas and legacy were distorted to fit the political climate.  Major kudos to author Sue Prideaux who had to understand Nietzsche, Wagner, Schopenhauer and others well enough to explain their works to me. I’m sure there are many tomes available on Nietzsche, so this tale at about 400 pages, is the perfect size to cover the subject for an enjoyable good read and to understand “I am no man, I am dynamite!”.

The book seems primarily concerned with the data of its subject rather than his character, though there are flashes where the person of Nietzsche shines through. This is not a bad book by any means, but neither is it a great one. It has a stupendously engaging title, and a few chapters throughout that manage to live up to the expectation it sets. The rest, much as it pains me to say, are rather uninteresting."

Prideaux nostaa virkistävästi esille Nietzschen omassa ajassa varsin poikkeuksellista protofeminismiä, vaikka ei siloittelekaan tämän myöhäisimmissä kirjoituksissa esiintyviä misogyynisiä heittoja. En ole ajatellut että kukaan enää tänä päivänä kuvittelisi Nietzschen olleen antisemitisti tai fasistinen nationalisti, mutta Prideaux joka tapauksessa ruotii tätäkin asiaa erinomaisen perusteellisesti, joten tutustukaa ihmeessä tähän hienoon teokseen jos asia vielä epäilyttää. Kaiken kaikkiaan lumoava, sekä selkeä että vetävä tietokirja, jonka takana on valtava määrä taustatyötä. Lopun lukeminen oli musertavaa, vaikka suunnilleen tiesinkin mitä tuleman pitää."

Nietzsche is such a complex and misunderstood figure, a kind of bogeyman to throw around to give the appearance of heft to one’s knowledge.

Eventually I decided to take a closer look at his work. After reading The Birth of Tragedy and Zarathustra I felt that reading a bio of his life was in order.This book gives you a closer look at his life & ideas; from his pious childhood, to becoming a professor (at age 24!), to his descent into madness.📝 Sickness & ProductivityFrom an early age he struggled with terrible episodes of headaches with vomiting & extreme eye aches that lasted for days.But what could have been a crushing fate, made him more determined:“Spurred on by physical limitations and gloomy prognostications, he seized each productive moment. His appetite for work was prodigious”.Nietzsche’s struggle with illness reminded me of Beethoven. Who, when staring to lose his hearing, had a prolific creative output and worked in a frenzy to squeeze out every last ounce of music contained within him.📝 God is deadNietzsche’s statement ‘God is dead’ said plainly the obvious what his age refused to acknowledge. The Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution had killed God. Without religion and belief in the divine, there were no longer any moral authority for the laws that western civilization was built upon.Nietzsche saw his contemporaries continue to live their lives without concern for this inauthenticity.“Given the power to live without religion, man must take responsibility for his own actions. “⚖️ VERDICT:A person once commented on my Instagram that the philosophy is often more interesting than the life of the philosopher. That rings true for Nietzsche. He is portrayed as an insecure and socially awkward nerd…armed with an inflated ego! Regardless, exploring his philosophical ideas is worth your time!

37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51015811-james-earle,Rating 4 out of 5,"Like many, I remember having a very undisciplined fascination with Nietzche during my early undergraduate years that functionally manifested itself in my picking up Thus Spake Zarathustra or Beyond Good and Evil from time to time, reading for an hour or two, and then thinking of myself as a very free thinker. It was great to read this biography and dispel all the half-truths I thought I knew about him. It was a book I didn’t know I wanted to read until I started reading it. Nietzsche's name, as he predicted, came to stand for something powerful, though perhaps uniform and monolithic in the popular imagination: the atheist/nihilist prophet. Prideaux throws his life on the page to show that Nietzsche wasn’t one thing. She shows his evolution, and she, more importantly, often lets him tell the story of his evolution through long passages from both his both public and personal writing. We learn about his relationship with Wagner, Burkhardt, his sister, Lou Salome, and others. These were relationships I knew he had but had no real understanding of their nature before reading this book. The biography describes a man who suffered from persistent physical maladies and defended the individual in a rapidly changing world approaching the turn of the century. He turned his life into a parable; left mentors behind; depended on his friends, and walked four to five hours every day. Prideaux also helped me understand his humor. I remembered Neitzche’s writing as though it were a revelation, but it also had irony, and often the message was not simply, as I used to think of it, to help you put a gun to the head of all your beliefs. He was playful and supported life-affirming activities. He didn’t just tear things down, he also built a philosophy that is purposefully open-ended, and, as Prideaux explains, often ends with an ellipse. As she put it, “And so the “higher man” or “Superman” or “free spirit” or “Ubermensch or “philosopher of the future or “philosopher of perhaps” or “Argonaut of the spirit” - call him what you will- is playful. Life is no longer a table fo laws. It is a dance to the music of “what if?”. Awareness of ourselves and awareness of the world around us both depend on the conception that we ultimately do not understand either ourselves or the world.” "

Prideaux writes well, she has a great eye for the important details and for knowing what can be left out, and a flare for narrative. Her destruction of Elisabeth Nietzsche is glorious; her writing on Friedrich is obviously even-handed, since I thought this was a solid, much-needed hatchet job, but Prideaux herself seems to think she was showing the enduring appeal and importance of his ideas. The utter absurdity of much of Nietzsche's thinking comes through clearly, as does the tremendous importance of his critical work. 'How to philosophize with a hammer'?

41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/79967313-walter-arvid-marinus-schutjens,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a deeply intimate portrait of a man that really knows no historical equal, a mutation of the biological phantasmagora of competing wills who managed to live an authentic life only because it was burdened by the truth of his philosophy. That is of course not a truth as I see it, but as he manifested it, as he willed it into existence; discovering, as one should assume for a 19th century iconoclast, a myriad of obstacles (women, wagner, wars) in his way. I read this biography whilst hiking in the same valleys of the Alps where Nietzsche spent his years of alienation from all things ‘All too Human’ die ‘Wanderjahre’. There was so much in this book that made me want to revisit every written work of his that was portrayed in Prideaux’s biography as deeply entwined with his daily struggles; to read through again the prose that only finds its equal in the German language in Goethe and Luther, and which apparently were jotted down in illegible bursts of crazed inspiration over the course of only a few weeks in some half darkened room in southern climes. The mans, or anti-christs, life was as if lived in a Böcklin panorma; tempestous, grave, edifying, and above all filled to the absolute brim with a heavy Romantic symbolism.The kind of Freigeisterei (freethinking) achieved by Nietzsche whilst he lived dangerously on ‘life’s dancefloor of eternal mistakes’ is for me something exclusive to the rare intellectual circumstance of the late 19th century, a richness of ‘philosophy done with a hammer’ borne out of cultural and political crises that Sue Prideaux manages to capture so effortlessly. I was already a fan of her work having read her biography of Edvard Munch, and am now looking forward to that of the playwright Strinberg; each of her subjects coming out of the intelectual mileu of the Berlin ‘Black Kettle Group’ the nihilistic avant-garde of cosmopolitan Europe borne in the empty churches of christian faith and walking into the shadows of anti-semitic nationalism. Each were visionaries, but in his priviliged role as a philosopher Nietzsche was so in the most radical regard. His philosophy of reevaluation and what Prideaux calls somewhat kindly for the uniniated reader ‘concept-quaking’ is one that is necessary, clarifying, problem solving, and despite its ravings against the possibility of the unconditioned the deep understanding embedded in his thought of the psychologically managed contradictions of the human condition were always going to become clear to humanity; whether it be through his initial biblical prophesizing and later polemical aphorizing, or as a sudden realization when reflecting on the ravages of war perpetrated by exactly the forces that he warned and railed against all his life. Despite the work of great contemporary biographers and philosophers such as Nehemas, Kauffmann and Prideaux, due to the breadth of his influence both post-modern and post-‘humiliation of the great German Empire’, Nietzsche’s person is always first apprehended with a shadow of doubt by the modern consciousness. I remember during my studies at UCL under the Nietzschean dramatist Tom Stern that the initial lecture even contained a forewarning of the coming content, a sort of philosophical trigger-warning of his ‘most-referenced-in’ list. After reading this biography that is a fact that saddens me deeply, and it is indeed the feeling that I came away from the book with. This sadness was yes filled with the pity that Nietzsche so much reviled (for incase it was unclear I have a chronic case of slave morality) but mostly a rage towards his ignorant fascist sister who had him live the last 10 years of his maddened life in shame, parading his shell of a consciousness that was lost to the maddening forces of nature to her posse of Wagnerian reactionaries and anti-semitic colonisers. Rewriting his endearing Ecce Homo (a purposefully false and fantastical autobiography) to remove the negative references to her and bring to the forefront those aspects of his thought adopted by the murdering fanaticists and crucially anti-individualists that Nietzsche so much reviled. What you are left with, in stark contrast to the image that she allowed to be made of him, was a truly kind, mild mannered, incurably driven and absolutely incurably sickly man; one who despite his persistent failures, embarassments, and disease managed to live with dignity and in a more fiery and authentic manner than any of us could even begin to hope for in this dreary conformist phantasm of a falsely liberal life; all in all as something Nietzsche was himself fond of to be termed by the literary critic Georg Brandes an ‘aristocratic rebel’. In a strange way I almost percieve this book as an extension of Nietzsche’s own philosophy. His philosophy is one, as was famously taken up by Foucault, of digging, of archealogical problematizing and genealogical analysis. The truth is lived, it is biographical, it is a process of becoming to which Nietzsche saw no end - no end that could be dogmatically imposed or philosophized as existing in the ‘things in themselves’ in any case. In fact if any coherent self is to be lived through it must immeadiately be contradicted by an alterior self to allow the psyche the freedom of choice and perspective. It is only in this sense that I give this book 4 stars as a perfect biography cannot be written of this man, an autobiography on the other hand is a different story and for a different review. "

I was as glued to this book as if I was reading a thriller which considering Nietzsche’s life sort of was one. What I realized that the idea people have of him is very far from who he was. He was a lover of life not only on paper but in reality. He lived life truly following his notion of amor fati (love your fate) even though living was made difficult for him by damage to his eyes and frequent headaches, insomnia and other strange ailments . That he had an impish side and played piano beautifully. He loved people, was nice to women and in fact had few women friends and patrons. He wasn’t a loner so much as was made to be by his sickness that came upon him from time to time. It was this unease in his physical body whether it was his eyes or headaches or insomnia that he started spending a lot of time in his mind and in nature. Meditating on high mountains and then very beautifully delivering his thoughts to us. I was worried I won’t be able to handle his ending years but Sue Prideaux wrote about it in very matter of fact kind of way which helped not to cry and if anything I was feeling anger towards Nietzsche’s sister. What a narcissist she was. And she got to live to be 90 years old!Nevertheless her star has fallen and Nietzsche’s still shines bright and keeps inspiring people till this day."

El filósofo destructor de valores, el incomprendido, el malinterpretado, el tergiversado, el utilizado, el odiado...hasta ahora. Porque ahora Sue Prideaux nos ha descubierto al auténtico Nietzsche, uno de los personajes más importantes del siglo XIX. Apoyada en un magnífico trabajo de documentación, la autora ha compuesto su obra de manera inversa a la que estamos acostumbrados; nos habla del hombre (no de su filosofía), basando sus afirmaciones en anotaciones del propio autor o de sus allegados. Y de ahí nos expone sus trabajos como consecuencia directa de esas vivencias, de su inteligencia asombrosa y de su marcada personalidad en conjunción con el contexto histórico y social. Escrita en un tono ameno y con pequeñas pinceladas de un humor irónico, no pasa nada por alto. Comienza descubriéndonos a un niño sensible que, con un fervor religioso innegable, pronto se planteará aquello en lo que cree y lo sustituirá por sus propias ideas. Apasionado por la música y la literatura, su vida sufre un cambio de rumbo importante a raíz de la muerte de su padre. Fallecimiento que Prideaux logra asociar con las dolencias de juventud de Nietzsche en la escuela Pforta, poniendo en duda el primero de los mitos que desmonta. El de la sífilis. Pero el interés de esta lectura no está en la polémica morbosa, ni en señalar con el dedo a su hermana Elisabeth por el flaco favor que le hizo de cara a la historia (si quieres saber más, lee el libro). Lo mejor es descubrir poco a poco, casi con tempo de novela en algunos pasajes, la manera en que llegaron y crecieron sus pasiones, como la que sintió hacia Wagner, Cosima y Schopenhauer. Poder apreciar casi en primera persona la evolución de su pensamiento, la forma en que le marcaron las decepciones que la vida le reservaba y como se fue distanciando de aquellos con los que durante un tiempo compartió rumbo, es algo que muy pocos autores han logrado y menos en apenas 400 páginas (sin contar citas, bibliografía etc). Además, colateralmente, es un excelente retrato de época, de las tensiones y conflictos europeos, y del ambiente cultural en el que vivía inmerso: siempre estaba relacionado, incluso de estudiante, con personas más importantes que él a los que atraía su estimulante inteligencia y personalidad. De hecho, según nos cuenta Prideaux, era asombrosa la facilidad con la que, tras una breve exposición de ideas de otros, profundizaba en los conceptos y llegaba a conclusiones inabordables para la mayoría. En este libro conoceremos al Nietzsche apasionado, al amante de la música y la cultura griega, al patriota, al enfermo, al desilusionado, al exaltado, al enamorado y al deprimido. Al hombre. Pero inevitablemente también le acompañaremos en los descensos a sus infiernos... Hay que tener claro que la obra que nos ocupa es una biografía, no una disección filosófica. Tal vez por eso no profundiza lo suficiente en las influencias, por ejemplo, de Schopenhahuer y Kant en su pensamiento y si da mayor importancia a sus relaciones humanas. Con toda seguridad hay obras más completas y eruditas en lo que a análisis de su filosofía se refiere, pero ninguna aborda tan en profundidad el desarrollo personal e intelectual del filólogo-filósofo. Tampoco se habían descrito antes así todos sus condicionamientos físicos y sentimentales (tratados con sumo respeto y delicadeza). Aquí se pone todo en contexto (personal e histórico) y se desmontan, por tanto, muchas de las cosas que se han dicho y aceptado como ciertas en la vida del genial personaje. Es, en conclusión, un libro recomendado para tod@s aquell@s que se sientan atraíd@s por su obra, su época, o su vida. Pero, sobre todo, es un texto que deben leer sus detractores que ya no tendrán excusas para seguir viendo en él a un antisemita o un pilar del pensamiento Nazi entre otras cosas. Sue Prideaux lo pone todo en su sitio.Reseña de:elyunquedehefesto.blogspot.com/2019/0..."
48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41735508-noah-goats,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've long disliked Nietzsche because of the terrible damage his ideas wreaked on the 20th century, but I love Sue Prideaux's book about him. She paints a portrait of a highly sympathetic Nietzsche, a man who struggled against the ingrained biases of his day as well as his own constant physical suffering. She humanizes the man who wanted to leave humanity behind and who thought that ideals like altruism and democracy were just relics of the ""slave morality"" forced on Europe by Christianity.It's the constant struggle of his life that made me root for him despite myself. I knew he wasn't a bestseller, but I hadn't realized just how dismal the sales of his books always were. His books weren't feared or despised in his day, they were almost totally ignored. He loved music more than anything, but was a failure as a composer and had a tortured relationship with his musical idol, Wagner. He suffered frequent debilitating headaches that left him bed-ridden for days in addition to other maladies. Much of his life seems to have been lonely and wandering. The bit in the Friends theme song where it says, ""Your love life's D.O.A."" could have been sung about him.He also had an awful sister named Elisabeth. Prideaux wanders from the central story of Nietzsche's life to tell us about her misadventures. Elizabeth was an anti-Semite and all around terrible person who married an equally dreadful husband. The two of them built a German colony in Paraguay based on their racist ideals. The colony was a hellhole and they had to resort to fraud in order to get financial backing and colonists. The story of this colony is fascinating, and even though it may not seem absolutely necessary in a book about Nietzsche, it helps illustrate why it was disastrous for Elisabeth to have had any part in shaping her brother's legacy. I loved the bits of the book about Elisabeth.In sum: If you are interested in Nietzsche, you should read this book. Even if you aren't particularly interested in him you might like it."

Prideaux has done a good job of portraying the man and exploring his works. Her writing style makes the information on complex issues very readable.I had no idea that Nietzsche's father went mad at age 35 and that Nietzsche feared the same for himself. Nietzsche did go mad at age 44 and remained so until his death twelve years later. I was surprised by the vision he had at age twelve, making such an impression on him that he dedicated his life to God. Yet he greatly changed that view as he grew older. I had no idea about his relationship with Richard Wagner and the power music had on Nietzsche. I had no idea of his fragile health and failing eyesight, his short experience as a professor, the less than glowing reviews for his works, making references to his divinity as he slipped into madness.I recommend this well written biography to those interested in understanding more about the life and works of Nietzsche.I received a complimentary digital copy of this book from the publisher.

52,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10615847-weird,Rating 5 out of 5,"The first thing one might mention regarding Sue Prideaux’s 2018 biography of Friedrich Nietzsche is that it is a hoot. This is a kind of vernacular (perhaps especially Canadian) way of saying that it is a lot of fun to read. You would not call I AM DYNAMITE! dry. It is a book engineered so as to glide, its readability perhaps its most distinctive feature. I lack the imagination sufficient to conceive of a person capable of finding it alienating or punishing or anything of the kind. You do not require any kind of advanced degree. I am certain I would have adored the book when I was fourteen or fifteen and had just bought myself a copy of BEYOND GOOD AND EVIL, one of the first books of philosophy I ever read, my formal education typical of a person of that age even if my zeal was perhaps slightly uncustomary. Though this is a book about one of the great thinkers of the second half of the 19th century, it is written is an accessible contemporary style. Nietzsche’s texts are dealt with extensively and in good faith, but Prideaux has a sure hand when it comes to making this stuff maximally palatable. Nietzsche himself was, of course, not a fan of fatuously rareified prosody, fancy-pants disquisition, jargon-heavy philosophy, or lengthy sentences. Prideaux’s focus on clarity and lusty exposition would not likely find fault with her subject, non-starter though conjecture on that subject would surely constitute. The conventional biography more often than not does not start at the beginning of the subject’s life. It is customary to find an ideal entry point—decisive moment (apologies to Henri Cartier-Bresson) as nascent framing devise. Prideaux mounts a more than merely serviceable approach. I AM DYNAMITE! begins on November 9, 1868, your humble reviewer’s -111th birthday. Twenty-four-year-old Nietzsche, an undergraduate studying philology and linguistics in Leipzig, “saved from nonentity by peculiarly arresting eyes,” recounts the story, to his friend Erwin Rohde, of his, Nietzsche’s, recent meeting with the appreciative and fantastically loquacious Richard Wagner, the eminent composer sharing with young Friedrich a passion for, among other things, the then-widely-ignored Schopenhauer (deceased as of 1860), a used copy of whose THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION the younger man had stumbled upon shorting after his arrival in Leipzig three years earlier, apprehending in said text “sickness and health, exile and refuge, Hell and Heaven.” Nietzsche would over the ensuing years become extremely close to Wagner and his mistress-and-then-wife Cosima, herself as notorious as her not-yet (as of 1868) husband, her also happening to be the less pretty, though more capable, of Franz Liszt’s two daughters. Beginning her book with the arrival of Wagner into Nietzsche’s life is smart strategy, especially in light of the subsequent legacy of Freud and his intellectual descendants, precisely because we come to behold in Wagner a salient father figure available for a congenial Oedipal through-line insofar as concerns the life of Nietzsche. It also pays dividends when it comes to assessment of the great philosopher’s hijacked legacy. If young Friedrich was in need of a surrogate father, this was in large part because his own paterfamilias—a Lutheran pastor, conservative and royalist, his firstborn named after the reigning Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia—died from “brain softening” at the age of thirty-five following years of progressive mental and physical deterioration. Following dad’s death, the boy would stay on in Naumburg with mother, younger sister, paternal grandmother, and some batty aunts (congenital mental health problems appearing to run rampant in the bloodline). Little Friedrich’s childhood milieu would place him ideally to become future bosom buddy to the older Herr Wagner. “Round Naumburg pressed the black Thüringer Wald, the Thuringian forest: Germany’s ur-forest with its tombs of ancient heroes, dragon caves, dolmens and dark abysses that from the earliest days of German myths symbolized the irrationality and uncontrollability of the German subconscious. Wagner would appropriate it for Wotan’s mental journey toward embracing chaos, resulting in the destruction of the old order through the death of the gods and the cancelation of all the old contracts. Nietzsche would characterize it first as demonic and later as Dionysian.” The Oedipal struggle between Nietzsche and Wagner would in large part constellate around the question of which epochal genius was the true heir to Dionysus, Cosima Wagner remaining the Ariadne within the quasi-domestic triangulation irrespective of which man might figure as the alpha at any given time. A heinous business, all this, fundamentally comic. The comedy is only enhanced by the outrageous decadence of the Wagners and Tribschen, their paradise retreat. Prideaux finds much baroque madness in the mere itemization of Wagner’s bananas wardrobe. It’s terrific stuff. Of course, Wagner was something of a pet cause for King Ludwig of Bavaria, an equal at the very least when it came to absurd ostentation, hysterical folkloric nationalism, and deranged egomania. In the mid-19th century there was nothing like a unified German state. This was the era of Prussia and the German Bund, the latter bundle of independent principalities resembling no kind of unified body. Wagner believed ardently in pan-Germanism as some kind of Platonic ideal. He despised the French, reviled Jews. Wagner and his legion of adherents in large part presage the Nazis and their manifold crimes. Hitler would eventually make the pilgrimage to Bayreuth, site of what we might call Wagner’s Ring Cycle Theme Park, Mecca of the Wagner Cult (this year’s iteration of the Bayreuth Festival is set for Jul. 25 – Aug. 30). Wagner’s music would totally change Nietzsche’s life. The gateway drug was TRISTAN AND ISOLDE. Everything was categorically upended, he was rapidly hooked. Later in his truncated life he would come to prefer Bizet’s CARMEN, earthy and raw, innumerable performances of which he would ultimately attend. He would break with the Wagners, ultimately insisting, himself an almost permanently sick man, that Richard Wagner had made music ill. Wagner was nonetheless a complex figure of his time. Prideaux informs us that he fought alongside the great Russian anarchist Bakunin in the Dresden uprising of May 1848. Alas, he would eventually become a grotesque cult of personality. (Nietzsche would himself be turned off militarism by harrowing experiences serving in the Franco-Prussian War.) We have established that Nietzsche was enthralled with Dionysus well before he embarked on his major philosophical project(s). The German-speaking world of the day was rife with Hellenic Grecophilia. Early on Nietzsche would become versed in the Greeks, his indefatigable industriousness in this regard situating him to become Chair of Philology at Basel, a man of twenty-four meagre years, not yet having earned a degree. Early on he was inspired by Lord Byron, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and, in a very key sense, by the German poet Friedrich Hölderlin’s play THE DEATH OF EMPEDOCLES. Though his relatives wanted him to become a cleric like his father, Nietzsche was more interested in the philosophers of antiquity. As a young academic in Switzerland, Nietzsche would befriend the first key anti-Wagnerian in his life, Basel historian Jacob Burckhardt. “It was said he [Burckhardt] would not endure Wagner’s name being mentioned in his presence. Bony, brusque and brilliant, he was a neurotically private man who dressed anonymously and strongly disliked any form of pomp, pretension or fame. He lived in two rooms above a baker’s shop and nothing pleased him better than to be mistaken for the baker.” Nietzsche would remain in contact with Burckhardt for as long as he, Nietzsche, remained more or less sentient, and if Burckhardt was miserly with praise the praise was all the more gratifying when come it did. If young Nietzsche found in Schopenhauer and Wagner an empowering conjunction of Will & Music, he was perhaps destined to break away. Prideaux repeatedly elucidates the concept of Selbstüberwindung, or self-overcoming, and it becomes clear to the reader how Nietzsche's self-overcoming is obligated to overcome Wagner, Schopenhauer, and their dubious influence. Nietzsche's career as a philosopher begins with THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY, something of a hymn for Wagner and Ancient Greek theatre, and toward the end we have THE CASE OF WAGNER, Nietzsche’s final attempt to extricate himself critically from the surrogate father’s influence (presenting the image of Dionysus blasted to pieces). I have always been very glad that Nietzsche moved beyond the BIRTH OF TRAGEDY, but I still believe it marks a perfect beginning. It is my contention that to abide satisfactorily in this world one must first be able to wrest beauty, poetry, and inspiration from the tragic dimension of life. Already at the age of seventeen, Nietzsche, Prideaux tells us, “a pupil at the foremost German school devoted to the civilized cult of Olympic reason and clarity [Pforta] […] was exploring the idea of emancipatory insanity and the validity of the irrational.” Up until he turned thirty-six, Nietzsche was obsessed with the notion that he would go mad and die at thirty-five, the same way his father had. This was not exactly the philosopher’s idea of a bad end. He believed that the true visionary must become made or, failing that, put on a good show of madness. Years of wandering, explosions of alpine exaltation. “Madness was total freedom. It was the speaking trumpet of the divinity. If madness was not conferred, it must be assumed.” When he ultimately did go completely mad in 1889, some friends, who had taken him at his word, did wonder if he was faking. It would quickly become evident that this was not possibly the case. He spent his adult life nearly blind and constantly unwell, producing his major works in heroic spasms between prolonged convalescences (each frenzy a new birth, a new career). He stayed nowhere long. He had a special fondness for Sils Maria. He loved Genoa, Christopher Columbus’s hometown. In October of 1876, shortly after his thirty-second birthday, Nietzsche, in Genoa, beholds the sea for the first time in his life. Nietzsche saw himself as an aspiring yea-sayer. He wanted to affirm. To take on what the world presents and overcome his own personal complexes rather than the ineradicable facts at hand. I still continue to meet people who believe Nietzsche was a nihilist. How can anybody say this of the author of THE GAY SCIENCE (recently translated as THE JOYFUL SCIENCE) and his lionization of the concept of ‘amor fati.’ If THE GAY SCIENCE was indeed Nietzsche’s great affirmative text, a well as his most generous to women, Prideaux believes this is because he wrote it while in love with the famous Lou Andreas-Salomé (close also to Rilke and Freud). Nietzsche became embroiled in what was by all accounts a chaste threeway relationship with Salomé and the Jewish philosopher Paul Rée. To the influence of Rée we probably owe much of THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS, Nietzsche’s most brilliantly lucid book, following not too long as it did after the various volumes of THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA, probably his, uh, zaniest. As for Nietzsche's eventual breakdown in Turin, Prideaux, who doesn't believe it had anything to do with syphilis, details matters with extreme skill. Perhaps my favourite paragraph in the whole book: ""He was starting to lose control of his features. He wrote jubilantly telling Peter Gast about it. It was of no account! Nothing to worry about! He pulled so many silly stunts with himself! At concerts, the music affected him so much that he could not control his facial grimaces. He wept uncontrollably. He grinned. There were times when all he could do was stand in the public thoroughfare for half an hour grinning. For four whole day, between November 21 and 25, he had found himself unable to give his face a serious expression. He concluded that anyone who had achieved such a state must be ripe to become savior of the world. In two months' time, his would be the foremost name on earth. The most remarkable thing in Turin was the complete fascination he exerted over all classes and conditions of people. All faces changed when he entered a large shop or public space. He needed neither name nor rank nor money for them to place him always and unconditionally first. With every glance he was treated like a prince. There was an extremely distinguished air about the manner in which people opened doors for him. Waiters, radiant and elegant to a man, served his food as though they were serving a king. He was making a mental note of all the individuals who had discovered him in this, his undiscovered period. It was not altogether impossible that his future cook was already attending on him. Nobody took him for a German.” I have long been under the impression that Nietzsche became catatonic or nearly so almost immediately after his breakdown. This is not the case. Prideaux has done a remarkable job of opening my eyes to Nietzsche’s grim final decade, most of it under the care of that most famous nationalistic, racist, proto-Nazi villain, his sister Elizabeth. Anybody who knows anything about the life of Nietzsche almost certainly knows a little about the machinations of his sister. She would be close to both Mussolini and Hitler (she would eventually give the latter the gift of her brother’s walking stick). She was in jealous awe of the likewise anti-semitic Cosima Wagner. Nazi adjuncts Oswald Spengler and Alfred Bäumler would help her muddy her brother’s legacy. However, Prideaux also presents us with heroes like Georg Brandes and Harry Kessler. Brandes, who prized what he called Nietzsche’s “aristocratic radicalism,” helped to make Nietzsche famous in the final decade of the philosopher’s life (when Nietzsche was no longer compos mentis and could not enjoy the renown). Harry Kessler, a founding trustee of the Nietzsche archive, would ironically flee Germany and the Nazis in 1933. In a letter to mother and sister, Nietzsche has written: “I do not have this enthusiasm for ‘things German,’ and even less for keeping this ‘glorious’ race pure. On the contrary, on the contrary—"" The Übermensch on whose behalf he prosthelytizes is not an Arryan superman, but rather an “Argonaut of the spirit” who has witnessed the death of God and all the higher values of church and state. It is the determination of the Übermensch to throw out values, to express the flux of pure will itself, flung into 'perhaps,' an animal and a clown, enjoying (enjoyment the key) liberation from every sort of outmoded bondage. Readers of his texts must also remember that Nietzsche's megalomania and self-aggrandizement are in large part a matter of self-conscious clowning. Consider the crazed idiot grin."
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127839594-kaleb,Rating 5 out of 5,"Amazing book, this is probably my favorite of the year so far.My first takeaway is how insane German composers were. Cosima Wagner, Richard’s wife, was first married to Hans von Bülow and had two of Wagner’s kids while they were still married? Also, Hans might've been in love with Cosima’s dad? Bizarre.Secondly, Nietzsche really got the short end of the stick when it comes to relationships. Wagner was his hero and best friend, but he ended up embarrassing Nietzsche (spreading rumors that Nietzsche’s eye problems were from chronic masturbation) and having different political beliefs (anti-Semitism). Lou Salome, Nietzsche’s true love, ran off with his best friend. Nietzsche’s sister, Elizabeth, was a liar, an anti-Semite, and an all-around terrible person. Nietzsche did have a handful of committed friends, of course, but it seems like the most important relationships of his life collapsed.Another kinda sad fact is how bad Nietzsche’s health was. It was really, really bad, and he spent most of his adult life in pretty intense chronic pain. No one knew exactly what it was, but by the time he lost his sanity, he was almost blind, couldn’t sleep, and was on drugs constantly.I think learning about his life gives me a new perspective on his philosophy. One of his ideas is the eternal return, or the idea that we should will our lives to repeat exactly as they happened for all of eternity. It’s a pretty difficult idea to accept for anyone, but especially for someone who's had a life like Nietzsche's. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to know more about Nietzsche’s life and get an introduction to his philosophy.Quotes“One must be fleet of foot; one must dance. Life was not simple. If, one day, man would dare construct an architecture corresponding to the nature of the soul, that architect would have to take the labyrinth as the model. To give birth to a dancing star, one must first have chaos within. Inconsistency, changes of mind and urges to wander were a duty. A fixed opinion was a dead opinion, a made-up mind was a dead mind, worth less than an insect; it should be crushed underfoot and utterly destroyed.”“I will admit that the greatest objection to ‘eternal return’, my truly abysmal thought, is always my mother and sister … People are least related to their parents: it would be the most extreme sign of vulgarity to be related to your parents.”"

I am neither, and, thus, found it less than good. And, if you are looking for a deep dive on his philosophical works, don’t look here. Of the 380-ish pages, I would guess 10 are devoted to some analysis of thought. But, to be fair that’s not the intention of this work. Ultimately, this book is devastatingly sad. Nietzsche’s life was full of sickness and disease. When Nietzsche was not being gut-punched by bouts of illness, the book lustfully examines the many sexual rumors and allegations in his life. This drags the reader through dark emotional forests that leaves one feeling hollow and disturbed. Some people might be into that, but I am not. "

Richard Spencer, a leader of America’s “alt-right”, claims to have been “red-pilled by Nietzsche”, while Jordan Peterson quotes extensively from him. But let’s start with the Nazis. Growing up in Bismarck’s reich, there were three things Nietzsche hated: the big state, nationalism and antisemitism. “Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, that is the end of German philosophy,” he wrote, and “I will have all antisemites shot.”When it came to faking news, Elisabeth was a pioneer. On her brother’s death in 1900, Elisabeth didn’t think his death mask was sufficiently impressive, so she faked a second one. She did the same to his writing, rummaging about in his literary estate, cutting and pasting at will. She published an unreliable biography of him and delayed publication of his autobiography, Ecce Homo, until she had deleted uncomplimentary references to herself The Nietzsche Archive became an institution filled with extreme rightwingers, whose aggressive nationalism chimed with her own.Among them were Oswald Spengler, and Alfred Bäumler, who oversaw book burning in Berlin and prepared Nietzsche’s texts for new editions, including another The Will to Power that again gave the impression the text had been authored by Nietzsche himself. Bäumler was joined as editor in the Nietzsche Archive by Martin Heidegger. Ernst Krieck, a prominent Nazi ideologue, sarcastically remarked that apart from the fact that Nietzsche was not a socialist, not a nationalist and opposed to racial thinking, he might have been a leading National Socialist thinker.Nietzsche also has an undeserved reputation as a misogynist. Born in 1844, he attended one of the best schools in Europe while Elisabeth was sent to Fräulein Paraski’s institution to be taught how to capture a husband, run a household and speak just sufficient French to be considered elegant but not (God forbid) learned. Yet Nietzsche treated Elisabeth as an equal. He gave her reading lists, urged her to think for herself and widen her knowledge by attending public lectures.Nietzsche and Meysenbug intended to found a school for free spirits in the caves beneath Sorrento.The free spirits were to include women and nothing would be off limits in their study of culture, philosophy, aesthetics, religious scepticism and sexual freedom. The school never materialised but his friendship with Meysenbug widened Nietzsche’s feminist circle to include Meta von Salis-Marschlins, an activist for women’s suffrage, and Resa von Schirnhofer.Nietzsche is an unusual philosopher because he doesn’t tell us what to think. There’s no such thing as Nietzsche-ism. He sums it up in one of his aphorisms: “You repay a teacher badly by becoming merely a pupil.” In other words, read me but think further."

This book was illuminating on many aspects: the critical role music (and especially Wagner) played in Nietzsche's life; his absolute rejection of anti-Semitism, despite later misinterpretations of him by the Nazis; and just how sick and mentally oppressed he was. Nietzsche's family is riddled with serious illness, specifically mental illness, and it is helpful for understanding how Germany's most influential 19th century philosopher spent the last eleven years of his life with the mental capacity of a child. The book also helped clear up many ways that Nietzsche's sister, Elizabeth, cruelly maligned and used her brother's writing to enforce her own anti-Semitic agenda while he was slipping into insanity.Earlier this year I read a biography of Robert Nash (A Beautiful Mind) and was struck by the similarities between the two thinkers. Both were brilliant men who one day descended into delusions of grandeur and madness. Nash, of course, recovered; Nietzsche didn't. It is also unclear how much of Nietzsche's philosophy itself propelled his madness, or his madness his philosophy. Much of his writing is bizarre and obscure, appearing as the either the thoughts from depths of brilliance, or just the scribbles of a crazy person. There are parts of Nietzsche that are certainly profound--Nietzsche saw things no one else did. But, in pronouncing the death of God he assumed that the Ubermensch--himself being the prime example--could fill the divine shoes. And, of course, that is a burden that will drive anyone into insanity or megalomania. Nietzsche's arrogance in how he thinks about himself is staggering.I thought the biography, all in all, could have been much shorter. The first half of the book spends an incredible amount of time talking about Richard Wagner (you almost think it is a biography about him). Wagner does play a significant role in Nietzsche's life, but the author went so deep in Wagner that I began to lose interest and had to just slog through it. I also would have liked more attention given to his ideas in general and less to his travel plans across Europe. "

Must've been the Adam Driver of her times. Two interesting female characters in his life: the bewitching Lou Salome and the despicable sister Elizabeth whose anti-Semitism wasn't even in the top 5 of her worst traits. One thing you realise from the book is Hitler didn't come out of a vacuum, anti-semitism was very much in the air of 19th century Germany. “was, in short, a place as fecund physically and spiritually as Germany had been in the fine old days before the arrival of foreigners had infected the fatherland with their degeneracy, making Germany not a fatherland but a stepfatherland.”""Stepfatherland!""

Rather than focusing heavily on Nietzsche's philosophy she concentrates on his life and and friends, particularly composer Robert Wagner. She also ties Nietzsche's mental breakdown to his father's mental illness rather than syphilis. Nietzsche sister, Elizabeth, is also given an important role in the formation of his fallacious public image. It was her actions that lead to his identity as an anti-Semite and forerunner the Nazis. She also had control of his papers and copyrights after his death.Nietzsche's philosophy, when presented, plays into his life events and creates a connection between the person and the philosophy. Thus Spoke Zarathustra was mailed to the publisher the same day that Wagner's death was reported. Nietzsche saw this as the death of his ""father"" and the birth of his son. His personal experience with war seems to directly contradict the public's commonly believed definition of the Übermensch. Reality contradicts the common perception of the philosopher.Prideaux shows Nietzsche as a complex man in his thoughts but in many ways very human. Although his friends tended to be rich, he lived much more simply. Prideaux writes a balanced biography of one of the most maligned and misunderstood modern philosophers and corrects some serious wrongs that have no basis in fact. A very well done and cited biography that presents a true picture of the man. "

The Birth of Tragedy is the only of his works I've read in the past ten years and I had picture fresh in my mind of a Romantic wandering the goblin-haunted ur-Wood of the Teutons. As it turns out this represented only a very fleeting moment in Nietzsche's philosophical thinking. King Ludwig II, extravagant patron of Wagner, emerges as an extremely sympathetic character: The King was seen more and more infrequently these days. His day was wont to start with breakfast at seven in the evening in a tiny room lit by sixty candles, after which his night was usually spent gliding through his moonlit gardens in his sawn-carved sleigh to snatches of Wagner's music performed by concealed musicians.This was a very interesting book, perhaps especially for someone with an interest in but little real knowledge of its subject. The descent into madness is communicated with great effect by a series of snippets from Christmas cards of spiralling delusion and megalomania. The spectre of Nazism hangs over the book, in earlier chapters through the rift between Nietzsche and the Wagners, then eventually in the person of his sister Elizabeth, a zealous anti-Semite who after her brother's death controlled and manipulated his legacy to great effect. (She was rewarded for her efforts by not one, but three Nobel prize nominations). Prideaux is keen to quote Nietzsche's personal repudiations of anti-Semitism but I'm not sure she sufficiently demonstrates the 'real' meaning of certain of his pronouncements and in what way Nazism is in ideological conflict with them. Not to say that he advocated specific things that the Nazis did - no doubt he would have been appalled by them - but that his body of work does not a priori refute them. His feelings were sometimes wont to contradict his philosophy - for instance, he condemns pity but can't help himself from feeling it; he was deeply moved by Wagner's work, but believed this was a kind of sickness. Is his dislike of anti-Semitism another such case of private personal conflict or is it somehow rooted in the worldview articulated in his work? The problem might be that Nietzsche poses the unanswerable question: if we do away with religion and the metaphysical realm of Plato's ideals, and by honest extension its moral teaching, can there be any vestige of transcendental morality left independent of social convention? (I guess he would call Kant and the natural rights tradition a phoney smuggling in of Christianity by the backdoor). Many might say, no, but it's better to act as though there is. But this is the kind of intellectual laziness which Nietzsche won't tolerate. Anyway, clearly I enjoyed this book a great deal. It has made me want to learn even more about Nietzsche.  "

The principal weakness is perhaps that it very much concentrates on his life rather than his thought. You need to be familiar with at least some of his writings too. But there is no shortage of fascinating material on his life: the description of the Wagners at Tribschen is jaw dropping. Poor Nietzsche comes out of this rather well, though his last years of mental decay and insanity make for very grim and painful reading. I had not realised what an utter bitch his sister was: manipulative, criminally fraudulent, and an unrepentant anti-Semite and fanatical Nazi to the very end of her long life. Friedrich was none of these things, as this Life makes clear.

Even Marx was a Christian at heart, whether he admitted it or not. ""The first shall be last."" Certainly, this book succeeds at making you want to read Nietzsche. His philosophy is summarised in conjunction with descriptions of his mental state and social situation at the time of writing, revealing the truth in his conviction that philosophy is biography. Many things that an admirer of Nietzsche's philosophy may half-know about are well clarified in this biography, with sources. For example, I was completely unaware of the very personal and somewhat lurid circumstances which brought about the split between Nietzsche and Wagner, which I initially thought to be a completely intellectual split along the lines of Christianity and nationalism. Another - the popular idea that Nietzsche lost his sanity and died as a consequence of syphilis. This book makes clear that this diagnosis doesn't really hold water and may have been due to what was essentially an administrative error in the asylum and a misinterpretation of the ill Nietzsche's words. The passages describing the rise and fall of Nietzsche's entanglement with the Wagner household were a highlight for me. The ""characters"" of this pivotal part of Nietzsche's life come out vividly in Prideaux's excellent writing, not just the trinity of Nietzsche and the Wagners, but also the people on the side-lines of this intense and subtle relationship such as jealous conformist sister Elisabeth Nietzsche, who's farcical but (surprisingly) not entirely unsympathetic saga also provides a character study well worth reading.Unfortunately the last chapter was tarnished for me by pointless denouncements of the philosophers Oswald Spengler and Martin Heidegger, who were both to differing degrees associated with the Nazi party. In an otherwise well sourced book no source is given for Spengler's alleged twisting of Nietzsche's writings to a Nazi agenda, and no mention is made of his resignation from the board of the (at the time) Nazi controlled Nietzsche Archive in protest at the Nazi's crude racism and resentment, privately criticising anti-Semitism in much the same terms as Nietzsche did. It's true that Spengler was an elitist, a German nationalist, and a cultural determinist, but he never believed in the Nazi racial theories regarding Aryan ancestry and supremacy, nor is it characteristic of true-believers to have their books banned by the party they are accused of being in cahoots with. We know that Spengler's opinion of Hitler was low, and he shared the view, rightly expressed in this biography, that Hitler was an un-intellectual showman who was familiar with the Nietzschean catch-phrases, but not the content. Heidegger is a less easily extricable case but I think it is unfair to characterise him as wholly a party hack considering the depth of his writings and his later description of his own political engagement as ""stupid"".On the whole, however, this is a very readable and engaging portrait of one of the greatest minds to emerge from -and to fight against- the tangle of Western philosophical thought, and Prideaux manages the unlikely feat of making what could be a relatively dry tale compelling."

Unfortunately, the reader is giving very little indication through the text as to why Nietzsche is so revered - in these pages Nietzsche's philosophy and writings are reduced to pithy one-liners and couple-sentence minimizations. As I read it I thought, a person with no other knowledge of the man would simply roll their eyes at his influence. Useful as a supplement only."
75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/839597,Rating 5 out of 5,"Подобно на много велики хора и биографията на Фридрих Ницше крие редица спорни моменти и загадки. До 1944 г. творчеството на Фридрих Ницше е много популярно и издавано на български. Следват десетилетията на социализма, през които той е един от забранените „упадъчни” и „реакционни” автори. След 1990 г. Ницше става един от най-издаваните западни философи на 19 в. и на български е представено почти цялото му по-значимо творчество, голяма част с нови, качествени преводи, вкл. Събрани съчинения в 6 тома. Философското му наследство е тълкувано и интерпретирано от големи наши философи като проф. Исак Паси и др. Трудовете му продължават да се радват на преиздания и популярност.На този фон бе парадоксално, че на български език нямаше издадена отделна, цялостна биография на Ницше. Това е определено празнина, която може и трябва да бъде запълнена, а подобна книга би имала успех, защото животът на Ницше, както и творчеството му, е изпълнен с драматизъм, обрати, драматични възходи и падения, а след смъртта му е обект на полемики, изопачавания и дори сензационни интерпретации.Затова „Аз съм динамит“ попада тъкмо на място и се вписва добре в поредицата от забележителни биографии на творци на издателство „Ера“.Авторката на „Аз съм динамит“ е майстор на интелектуалната биография. След като издава няколко романа, писателката от англо-норвежки произход пише биографии на Едвард Мунк и Август Стриндберг – и двете успешни, оценени високо и удостоени с някои от най-престижните награди за жанра. Настоящата книга е издадена във Великобритания от престижното издателство Faber & Faber, спечелило правата на търг.Подобно умение личи и в „Аз съм динамит” (известният израз на Ницше от Ecce homo) – пространна, много добре документирана, опираща се на творбите, писмата, документите за живота на Ницше, но в същото време притежаваща достойнствата на плътна, ярка художествена проза. Книгата успява да предаде ясно, разбираемо и достъпно (една нелека задача) основните моменти, търсения трансформации на идеите на ницше в неговите творби като ги съчетава органично с увлекателно повествование за житейските му перипетии, за отношенията му с видните интелектуалци на неговото време - Вагнер и пр., с жените, с близките – особено майка му и сестра му.Тя успява също така с малко щрихи, но ярко да пресъздаде интелектуалната, куртурната, политическата атмосфера в Европа от втората половина на ХIХ в. сред която се вписва житейската и философска драма на Ницше. Авторката не заобикаля никой от острите моменти в по-късното интерпретиране на живота и творчеството на Ницше и в последната част се спира обстойно на перипетиите около литературното му наследство и ролята на сестра му за неговото изопачаване и насочване в услуга на национализма и нацизма.Казаното до тук не означава, че книгата е свръхлесно и популярно четиво – то е насочено все пак към изкушена и просветена публика, която не се интересува единствено от „скандалните” моменти в биографията на философа (дали е бил болен от сифилис, бил ли е антисемит и пр.), макар че и те са изяснени с нужната документалност и аргументираност."
76,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3437213-kelsey,Rating 4 out of 5,"I AM DYNAMITE! is an intimate look at the life and death of one of history's most well known philosophers- Friedrich Nietzsche. One of my favorite aspects of reading is the fact that I can pick up a book knowing very little about a subject and finish with a whole new perspective and wealth of information. Nietzsche was one of those figures that I knew most of the basics (i.e. ""God is dead""), but not nearly enough. He was incredibly complicated and Sue Prideaux's book gave a balanced and informative account of his life and death. The book opens with Nietzsche as a young boy and the early loss of his father. Nietzsche did not have the easiest childhood and struggled to connect with his peers. It was fascinating to see Nietzsche's transition from extremely religious with plans to serve the church to begin questioning God. He also developed relationships with a wide variety of significant cultural figures from Wagner to Lou Salome. Nietzsche meets and interacts with many different people throughout his life and they all impact his journey in different ways. He also develops some casual relationships with different women but none turn into anything permanent. I wonder how his life and legacy would have been altered if he had a wife and children to protect his beliefs and writing. Nietzsche had a lot of ideas that were not widely accepted for his time and it was sad to see how he struggled to connect with people until after his decent into madness and death. The final chapters were some of the most interesting to me. They were depressing and frightening, but Prideaux does a great job of attempting to dispel the syphilis rumors. Doctors were quick to assume that was the reason for Nietzsche's madness, so additional tests were never performed. The worst person in his life was his sister. Elisabeth did not care about protecting her brother's legacy. She only cared about money and making herself famous. Elisabeth twisted her brother's words, destroyed papers, and befriended Hitler and Mussolini. The beginning took me some time to get into as there were a lot of names and places I was unfamiliar with. Quickly, though, I found myself conducting research on every name that was mentioned and learned so much about the people in Nietzsche's world. I am especially interested in learning more about Lou Salome. I AM DYNAMITE! was an interesting and well-written biography of one of history's most controversial figures. I especially liked learning about some of the aphorisms that originated with Nietzsche like ""That which does not kill us makes us stronger"". Nietzsche's ideas were before his time and especially controversial because of his questioning of God and the church. I related to his joy of being by himself with nature and taking time to write and read quietly. This was a fascinating man and there is so much more to him that is worth reading about, particularly if you have only read the biased accounts put out by his sister and her followers. "

Prideaux is good at leaving aside ideological conjecture and pretentious theorizing in favour of a brisk, warts-and-all account of the man behind the moustache. And yet reading this I found myself longing for the verbose, overly ambitious prose of Pierre Klossowski's seminal quasi-biography of Nietzsche (that Prideaux surprisingly never references), which at least engages fully, even if unsatisfactorily, with Nietzsche's body of work (particularly the concept of Eternal Return). In Prideaux's account Nietzschean ideas are given only cursory treatment (the type of coverage you would expect to find in a Graphic Guide introduction) and there is even less engagement with Nietzsche's 'unpublished' fragments. This even as the author carefully sets aside space to condemn (rightfully so) Elisabeth Förster's rapacious and mendacious misuse of these fragments; how is the reader supposed to gauge the extent or true significance of this treachery without a glimpse into the 'abyss' of Nietzsche's late notebooks? The inclusion of a coda made up of a handful - by now completely clichéd - aphorisms, which Prideaux likens absurdly to ""Bob Dylan's lyrics"" in terms of ""relatability"", is by contrast weirdly superfluous and even embarrassing.A good if somewhat anodyne portrait of Nietzsche 'the man' but a failure as a proper introduction to Nietzsche's work."
79,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/659583-keith,Rating 5 out of 5,"This a deeply fascinating, well researched and written, biography of Friedrich Nietzsche. It is especially praiseworthy for its accessibility. It seems a deep challenge for a biographer to write the life of a philosopher but Sue Prideaux has succeeded wth a volume that tells the story of a life while also offering the reader insights into the writings. My own university encounter with Nietzsche was surely typical. A number of texts in translation were required reading, some lengthy like Beyond Good and Evil, some brief as with Thus Spoke Zarathustra and The Anti-Christ. The goal there was to read the texts as quickly as possible, in competition with other texts in other classes, in order to discuss in class. I remember skimming the introduction to one of the Nietzsche texts and absorbing some brief facts about his life. I think if I had read a biography as good as this one I would have had a more balanced and deeper understanding of the development of his thought. I say this knowing that it is possible to lazily let biography define interpretation but a biography such as this seems the idea companion in an exploration of Nietzche's life and thought.One thing I learned beyond the details of his life was that Nietsche's sister Elisabeth was one of the vilest creatures to walk around. Nietzche's end was so sad but I'm surprised his exploitative sister didn't have him stuffed and mounted in the Weimar Nietzsche Archiv. "

Still, the reader does get to know how various aspects of his life and experiences continuously shaped his philosophy, this necessitates presenting a condensed form of Nietzsche’s thoughts and ideas and the author does a very fine job of doing so. The tragic appropriation of his philosophical legacy by Fascists is also touched upon at the end and leaves the reader wanting to know more. Nietzsche’s aphorisms, a selected list appears at the very end, are a delight to read. Below is one such snippet in which he highlights his explosive role in western thought: “I know my fate, One day there will be associated with my name the recollection of something frightful – of a crisis like no other before on earth, of the profoundest collision of conscience, of a decision evoked against everything that until then had been believed in, demanded, sanctified.

That's not the case here. The time period was a rich background for an extraordinary life and mind. It helps that Nietzsche was born at the end of an age and the dawning of another, especially in German history but his thoughts are profound alone to stand till the current time. The flow and tone of Prideaux's writing is perfect for the material and is entertaining while being thorough. I had briefly wished she spent more time on his philosophy, placing him in the line of thinkers that he was responding to such as Kant or Schopenhauer but I think she intentionally made the biography about the man. And it works. You can read philosophy books for a more indepth exploration of his philosophy, this was his life. Writing: A+Accuracy and Research: A+Premise subject: A"

Also a number of entertaining anecdotes, especially involving his sister (villain #1) and Richard Wagner (villain #2) (which I won't spoil). The author makes the argument that Nietzsche's breakdown was not caused by Syphilis but by a family history of insanity. I'm not fully convinced, but it is worth a reappraisal. I listened to this on Audible and the narration was good if sometimes inconsistent in German pronunciation. I would have given this book 5 stars but I felt it ended too soon (with his sister's death in the 1930's) and did not update the fortunes of Nietzsche's reputation to the present (there was a significant reappraisal started by Walter Kauffmann and others in I think the 1950s)."

I'm afraid that I may now have turned into one of those people who discusses Nietzsche at parties.. though it all seems to be a little baffling that a man who was desperate for recognition and yet afraid of being idolised, is eventually remembered through his sister's renditions of his work, and their influence on popular opinion in Nazi Germany.

But this book clearly shows his intellectual journey, and I was amazed by how profound his ideas were. It also shows, unfortunately, how his ideas were twisted into nearly their opposite by the Nazi party who wanted intellectual justification for the policies of the Third Reich.

99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,Rating 2 out of 5,"""I am dynamite"" was not, as far as I know, said about himself BY Nietzsche. Rather, one of his first positive reviewers, JV Widmann, said ""There is dynamite here!"" in his review of ""Beyond Good and Evil.""It started out as a pretty good book, but not quite great. However, in the chapter on Nietzsche's post-madness life, Prideaux jumped the shark into what I consider mendaciousness, something I've run into on several recent reads.First, I’m not a Nietzsche Deadhead, but I’m familiar enough with enough of his works, having grazed through Walter Kaufmann’s Portable N. long ago, and thus knowing that the anti-Semitic claims were a fabrication by Elisabeth. (That’s not to say that every bit of Kaufmann’s take is correct.)I know that Nietzsche Deadheads reject the claim his madness was syphilis, and instead cite a brain tumor. Not so fast! Prideaux notes Elisabeth covered tracks on their dad’s death that leave open the possibility HE died of syphilis. If so, N. could have had it congenitally. Beyond that, she indicates serious mental illness ran in his dad’s side of the family. So, whether due to syphilis or not, likely conclusion is that he was nuts, even before his breakdown.Also, I’m not a medical doctor nor do I play one on TV, but brain tumors don’t normally produce insanity of the sort of N’s. And, a tumor that did such would surely have killed N in much less than 11 years.That said, the diagnosis of tertiary syphilis upon admission to Basel’s clinic in 1889 is compounded by N. actually having had gonorrhea twice. And, he was apparently never examined after transfer to Jena.That said, there's an issue here. Prideaux suggests a variety of reasons for his insanity, and that of his foather, without ever mentioning frontotemporal dementia and without noting a 2006 paper covered this in detail. Its symptoms would cover everything N. suffered, and his dad before him, other than the deteriorating eyesight.Her noting of Harry Kessler’s descriptions of N. are interesting. Definitely, the full background of Elisabeth and husband’s grfiting attempt to start Neuva Germania, and of course her appropriation of his work and ideas in the service of anti-Semitism was good.Third, she further convinces me that, even if one discounts his earlier work, N. is surely one of the most overrated philosophers of the 19th century, and possibly one of the most overrated in the entire Western canon. If not among “most” overrated, he’s certainly overrated. I think he horribly misinterpreted much of Hellenic philosophy, ie, pre-Socratics through Aristotle (to the degree he cared about Aristotle), and didn’t wrestle with how Hellenistic philosophy saw the Hellenic.That said, the book’s not perfect. The main failing is that I infer that Prideaux is insinuating in spots that some of his illnesses, around times of visiting his mother or sister for any length of time, were psychosomatic. But, she never follows up with what I perceive as insinuations. (This connects with her insinuation that Father N.’s “inheritale disease” could actually have been syphilis, then no follow-up.)Prideaux also claims that August Strindberg’s introduction of Edvard Munch to N’s writings led him to paint his famous The Scream. Munch’s own description of his inspiration mentions no such thing. Wiki's description DOES mention that his sister was a patient at a asylum next to the spot he was painting in the background. More here here, with Munch’s own words. That site notes that Munch’s painting has often been interpreted as reflecting N’s “god is dead,” but Munch himself said no such thing. In fact, it was part of a series of paintings called The Frieze of Life. And, contra Prideaux’s claim, Munch’s painting of N looks not at all like The Scream. Given that Prideaux has also written a bio of Munch, I won’t be reading it, and this book fell to three stars with this. And, though I only use my “bs-pablum” for 2 stars or less, I applied it here. Her Goodreads bio claims she trained as an art historian, which makes this all worse. I have NEVER heard this claim before. And, her claim Munch painted her grandfather comes off as riding on coattails.Beyond this, on the lesser side? It’s got historic errors, such as claiming Bavaria fought on Austria’s side in the Seven Weeks War, and her interpretations of life in the Bund (German Confederation, and why doesn’t she use that phrase?) are questionable at times. In addition, there’s a few linguistic errors. You “stanch” a wound, you don’t “staunch” it. Finally, for a book this level, a few more photos than it had, though the ones it did have were good.And, I added the part about frontotemporal dementia after posting the initial review. And, with that, dropped the review back to two stars."

I was interested in reading Nietzsche because of Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning. Nietzsche's “He who has a why to live can bear almost any how"" was quoted several times in the book and it painted a different picture of the man I thoroughly misunderstood, thanks to the many philosophy memes and inaccurate nihilistic impression of his philosophy, at least to the much younger, existentially conflicted, undergraduate version of me.I have attempted to read a few philosophy books but gave up as soon as I started. English is not my first language and the level of commitment needed to grasp the intricacy of the often translated versions of the most important work in philosophy terrified me. This time, I wanted to finish reading at least one his books and so the Internet recommended me this marvelous biography by Sue Prideaux to kickstart my journey to Nietzschean philosophy. As Atticus' Finch once remarked ""you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...until you climb into his skin and walk around in it,” I began to read Nietzsche by first understanding the man beneath the moustache. It ended with me crying ugly in front of my girlfriend while finishing my Macdonald's breakfast set.Prideaux excellent biography dispells the myth abot the man and reinvigorates his life with a deep sense of humanity that is often absent from casual philosophical readings by the uninitiated. Here was a man who was thrusted with somekind of parental expectation to become what he did not wish to be. Like any of us, he sought recognition and friendship from others, fell in love, and was rejected - his relationships with his mentors, Richard and Cosima Wagner, deteriorated as he began to drift apart from them philosophically, so did his friendship with Paul Ree and unrequited love for Lou Salome. He was sick for most of his life, almost blind even, and went mad at the end of his life. Perhaps it was the recognition of this ""softening of the brain"", that had claimed the life of his father and some of his relatives, that drove him to write so many books before the last bit of sanity left him in the January of 1889. Sadly enough, he was only internationally recognized when he had lost his capacity to understand the impact he had brought upon this world, and as if the amount of injustice done to his name was not enough, his work was twisted by his own sister to further her antisemitic goals.Nevertheless, despite of the sickness that had tormented him, despite of all his failed relationships with friends and family, he preached the philosophy of eternal recurrence, that as soon as our lives ended, it would begin again. The eternally recurring life will bring about not just the happiness but also all the pain and the suffering that we have had ever endured in this life, and that our only response will be amor fati, love your fate, embrace it, be free of all the anguish of life and live a life full of positivity and affirmation. I can only hope that I have at least half the strength of Friedrich Nietzsche, so that at the end of my life, I can shout wholeheartedly, full of love and acceptance of my life, 'Da capo!', again! "

I think this biography did a very good job of remedying this.I found it very interesting that Nietzsche's books found only a very limited readership during his lifetime (especially his productive years). His later works he even self-published (this being long before Kindle Direct Publishing).It is really interesting how one of the most widely read philosophers today was virtually ignored by his contemporaries. I wonder if this indicates that the time was just not ready yet for his ideas or that it matters more in what context and author is perceived than what the author wrote. I tend to believe the latter is the case here. As for Nietzsches thought, I think he makes some important contributions towards helping find metaphysical purpose in the absence of religious doctrine. However, ultimately the ideas are too fragmented and erratic to provide a solid philosophical framework.Here some quotes from the book:What does it mean to be human unchained from a central metaphysical purpose? Does a vacuum of meaning occur? If so, what is to fill that vacuum? If the life to come is abolished, ultimate meaning rests in the here and now. Given the power to live without religion, man must take responsibility for his own actions.Here the ways of men divide. If you want to achieve peace of mind and happiness, then have faith; if you want to be a disciple of truth, then search.Man cannot live without such untruths. He cannot bear life without measuring reality by purely invented fictional systems such as philosophy, astrology and religion. And so the ‘higher man’ or ‘superman’ or ‘free spirit’ or Übermensch or ‘philosopher of the future’ or ‘philosopher of perhaps’ or ‘Argonaut of the spirit’ – call him what you will – is playful. Life is no longer a table of laws. It is a dance to the music of ‘what if?’ Awareness of ourselves and awareness of the world around us both depend on the conception that we ultimately do not understand either ourselves or the world."

Suffice it to say Nietzsche would have had a lot better reputation in the democratic world if he hadn't had his philosophy hijacked by perverse German ultra-nationalists, one of whom happened to be his sister. Nietzsche was not an anti-semite (he detested them, at least after he broke with Richard and Cosima Wagner) and he didn't even have German citizenship as an adult. (He gave it up when he went to work as Basel University's youngest professor.) In this book, the subject comes of as a philosopher of the existential variety, perhaps a nihilist, and certainly an iconoclast. He wanted to shock, but by the standard of his times tearing down the old goalposts of the Platonic pantheon was harsh. But compared to what the ultra-nationists and the budding warmongers of the late 19th Century time were doing, his work seemed less dangerous than what these nuts were doing to lay the groundwork for what was to engulf Europe in the new century. His sister Elizabeth was a social climber with big dreams and lots of hatred. She outlived him by thirty-five years, plenty of time to hijack his writings (with the help of other pseudo-intellects) into a bowdlerized form that buttressed the pathology of naziism. I read Nietzsche's biography by Sue Prideaux to try to get some background to this terrible story and came away with the added gain of actually understanding a good deal more of Nietzsche's thinking--too harsh for my taste, but not inhumane.  Nietzsche had a critical mind, perhaps too critical for his good health, but the man himself was not a bad person while he still had his reasoning mind. Eccentric? Yes.  Misogynist? Yes. Although he appreciated many smart women, he had his issues. Suffice to say this fellow wasn't a ladies' man by a long stretch. Toxic racist and political hack? No, no, and no. Nietzsche had an interesting, and sad, life. This book by Sue Prideux brings a lot of answers for the general reader about this oft-misunderstood philosopher. I appreciated her good writing and clarity, something you don't always get in philosophy overviews."
103,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/100376202-fons-mari-n,Rating 5 out of 5,"De Britse Sue Prideaux schreef met 'Ik ben dynamiet' een uitstekende biografie van de negentiende-eeuwse Duitse filosoof Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900). Ze verhaalt dus het merkwaardige leven van deze ongewone man, die veel geplaagd werd door hoofdpijn en ziekten die hem het werken aan zijn oeuvre beletten. Mede hierdoor ontstond zijn aforistische stijl, die vele van zijn boeken kenmerkt. De auteur is erin geslaagd een heel leesbaar werk te schrijven, dat uiteraard ook aandacht besteedt aan de talrijke boeken die Nietzsche schreef en die in leven alles behalve succes kenden. Op deze manier raakt de lezer op een toegankelijke manier vertrouwd met de belangrijkste begrippen uit Nietzsche filosofie. De auteur besteedt uiteraard ook aandacht aan de mensen waarmee Nietzsche nauw verbonden was, zoals daar zijn Cosima en Richard Wagner, Lou Salomé en Paul Rée en vele anderen die bij mij minder bekend waren. Bijzonder is zeker de rol van Friedrichs zus Elisabeth, die hem de laatste jaren van zijn leven verzorgde (Nietzsche was in 1888 gek geworden). Zo vernemen we dat ze een grote rol speelde in de bekendmaking van haar broer-filosoof, die aan het einde van zijn leven toch internationale erkenning kreeg. Haar rol is helemaal niet onbesproken: lang 'zat' ze als een kloekhen op het Nietzsche-archief en bovendien evolueerde ze als antisemiete (wat Friedrich duidelijk niet was) tot een fan van de opkomende nazi's in de jaren twintig. Zo verwrong ze de mentale erfenis van Nietzsche en konden de nazi's aan 'cherry picking' doen in zijn oeuvre, waarbij ze enkele begrippen aan hem ontleenden die ze in hun autoritaire ideologie incorporeerden. Friedrich zal zich omgedraaid hebben in zijn graf. Het is heel goed van Sue Prideaux dat ze in het laatste hoofdstuk uitgebreid ingaat op de rol van Elisabeth en de nazi's om Nietzsche gedachtegoed in een nieuw licht te plaatsen, anders dan het oorspronkelijk bedoeld was."
104,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120652676-nick-wallace,Rating 5 out of 5,"What I took away from Prideaux’s account of Nietzsche’s tragic life is that even the most intelligent, capable and potentially successful people in history confronted the same life challenges that we all do with relationships, family, friends, finding meaning in life and mental health problems. Sometimes these challenges get the better of us but that is ok because nobody is infallible. While I could not put I Am Dynamite down, I couldn’t help feeling that Prideaux underplays the influence and significance of Nietzsches’ philosophy in favour of a focus on the details of his life and his demise. Having read all of Nietzsches published works in English and quite a few biographies, Prideaux’s is certainly a gripping account, and yet the profundity and inspirational power of his philosophy only occasionally shines through. Nietzsche’s influence on Munch was something I hadn’t registered before so there are some new insights to be gleaned from Prideaux. However, she doesn’t do justice to the impact and originality of his thinking and it is obvious at times that she is not overly familiar with some of his key works. Read Prideaux to get a broad introduction to Nietzsche’s life and the relationships which shaped Nietzsche’s thought, but there is no substitute for reading the books of one of the greatest philosophers to ever consider the perennial dilemmas of how to find meaning in existence. When you read his works for yourself you very quickly realise that Nietzsche was not a proto-Nazi and he would have abhorred Hitler for his nationalism and his anti-semitism. Like any religion or philosophy, people always twist and adapt them to their own selfish needs. As Nietzsche himself would have encouraged, don’t rely on other people to interpret his ideas for you, read them for yourself. "

الراحل. قضى طفولة عادية، وتلقى تعليما جيدا، وأدت وفاة والده المبكرة الى وجود اخته وأمه بجانبه لرعايته، فكان من المخطط له أن يشغل نفس منصب والده كقس في الكنيسة، ولكن الشك بدأ يغزو افكار الرجل منذ سن مبكرة، مما جعله يتبرأ لاحقا وبشكل كلي من الدين والمسيحية. ظهر نبوغه في تخصص الفيلولوجيا (علم المصطلحات).، مما جعله يحصل على كرسي أستاذ في جامعة بازل بدون شهادة جامعية، كان في البداية مستمتعا بما يقوم به، لكنه سرعان ما بدأ يطمح للحصول على كرسي ٱخر لتدريس الفلسفة ولكن فشل مساعيه وتدهور صحته جعله يحصل على تقاعد مبك�� من الجامعة. قضى القسط الأكبر من حياة التأليف بصحة عليلة، وببحث دائم عن مكان يحوي مناخا مناسبا لكي لا تتدهور صحته. لقد عانى من مشاكل صحية عديدة على رأسها ضعف بصره الشديد مما جعله يقرب كثيرا الكتاب من عينيه من اجل ان يقرأ، كما أن للضوء تأثيرا كبيرا على عينيه فكان دائم البحث عن اضاءة خفيفة بمستوى معيّن، حتى لا يسبب له الضوء صداع الرأس فكان غالبا ما يتجول بقبعة على رأسه وبنظارات سميكة تقيه أشعة الضوء التي تتسرب مثل الانصال الحادة الى عينيه. عاش تحت رحمة طبّ غير متطور، يفتقر الى الفحص الدقيق، مما أورثه سجلا طبيا فوضويا لم يقفو من خلاله على وصف دقيق لحالته الصحية التي تتدهور في أحيان كثيرة. هذا التدهو الصحي، دفعه لأن يكافح من اجل استغلال لحظات الراحة لكي يكتب ويقرأ ويراجع افكاره، وكأسلوب دفاعي اتبع اسلوب الكتابة بالشذرات، حتى يدون افكاره بسرعة، وحتى لا يتكبد عناء طويلا في مراجعتها. دون ان ننسى انه كثيرا ما كان يستعين بأحد اصدقائه ليقرأ له بصوت عال او يمليه فيكتب له. كانت هوايته المفضلة، هي التجول وتسلق الجبال الشاهقة مثل جبال الألب، والتجول أيضا في امكنة لها مناخات خاصّة جدا، فأي تغيير بسيط في المناخ قد يدفعه للرحيل الى مكان ٱخر في مدينة اخرى. ومن الأشياء التي كان لها تأثير كبير عليه منذ شبابه، هي الموسيقى وولعه الكبير بها، كان يعشق موسيقى فاغنر، ولم يخطر على باله ان هذا الموسيقي العبقري سيصبح صديقه وسيقضيان أوقاتا ممتعة كثيرة، قبل ان يستفيق نيتشه من نشوته الموسيقية ويشن هجومات متتالية على فاغنر الذي لم يسلم من الهجوم عليه وعلى موسيقاه حتى بعد موته. لم يتزوج، هذا كان مستحيلا في نظره، لأن المعيار الأساسي في نظره لقبول امرأة كزوجة هي أن تكون على مستوى عال من الذكاء، حتى تتمكن في محاورته، وفهمه، وتغذية افكاره وحتى يهبها سر فلسفته . حتى لو الفاتنة التي عشقها، والتي اعتبرها في فترة ما حاضنة لأفكاره وأسراره العبقرية كانت مناهضة لفكرة الزواج، حيث رفضت عرضه في مرات عديدة. فشله مع النساء وتردده الكثير على دور الدعارة جعله يحتقر المرأة ويهاجمها كثيرا في كتاباته. لم يلاق عرفانا كثيرا في حياته حول مؤلفاته وهو بعقل جيد، كان يعتقد بأنه سابق لأوانه، وبأن الناس حوله لا يستطيعون فهم افكاره العبقرية، لكن عدم التجاوب المستمر مع مؤلفاته المتتالية جعله يشعر بخيبات عميقة. رغم ذلك استمر في التأليف والنشر وأحيانا قام بتمويل طبع كتب بنفسه. كان ينتظر بشوق الرسائل والمراجعات حول افكاره الثورية، وكان يراسل اصدقاءه ومعارفه بٱخر كتبه. لكنه لم يحظ بأي شهرة في حياته، وظل نكرة ومجهولا لسنوات طويلة، حتى فقد عقله، حينذاك بدأ العالم كله يتحدث عن نيتشه وفلسفته. ولعلّ أكثر الافكار خطورة في فلسفة نيتشه هي إنكاره لوجود أي أساس، لا شيء ثابت، ولا وجود لحقيقة، ولا شيء مطلق، كل شيء نسبيّ ومتغير ومتحرك. حتى الحقيقة نفسها هي محض اسطورة؛ الحل اذن في ظل غياب المطلق هو إرادة القوة. وهذا ما جلي الدمار على كثير من اجزاء اوروبا بعد نيتشه. يمكننا القول بكل يقين، بأن هناك فلسفة قبل نيتشه وفلسفة بعده، وكل الفلسفة التي جاءت بعد رحيله كانت متأثرة به بدرجات متفاوته. كان يمجد القوّة، ونظّر للإنسان الاعلى، قتل الاله وسعى لايجاد الانسان الاعلى، مقت الضعف والرحمة وجميع الفضائل الانسانية، لقد ساهم دون شك في صعود النازية الالمانية والفاشية الايطالية.  أصابه الجنون في سن 44 من عمره، فقد عقله وانطفات شعلته، وعانى لسنوات طويلة من الجنون. في البداية تحت رعاية مصحة نفسية ثم بعد ذلك تحت رعاية والدته، كان يمشي ��طريقة ميكانيكية مثل ٱلة، كان ساهم النظرة، ويكثر الزعيق والصراخ والقفز من دون سبب، وهرب يوما ما عاريا للشارع، كان لا يتحكم في بوله وغائطه، كان في حالة يرثى لها من الهذيان المستمر. لقد كانت نهايته تراجيدية، وكأن الاله الذي ادعى انه قتله انتقم منه، كيف لشخص يمجّد القوة ان يعيش معظم حياته عليلا، ثم ينتهي به المطاف مجنونا وعاجزا وعالة على الٱخرين، لقد كان يمقت الشفقة في حياته، وانه لمن الأكيد أن هذا هو الشعور الذي انتاب كل من قرأ كتاباته وأتيحت له فرصة رؤيته وهو في حالة عجز تام. وحين أتيت على مشارف الكتاب تذكرت مقولة نيتشه نفسه وهو ينصحنا أنه حين نرى معاقا ع��ى حافة حفرة يجب ان ندفعه ليسقط في الحفرة، فهل يا ترى كان سيقبل نيتشه العاجز والمجنون نفس المصير ؟ هل كان سيستدر الشفقة ؟ ويرجو أن نبقي على حياته وهو الرجل العاجز عن نفع المجتمع ؟ أوليست فلسفته كلها مبنية على القوة والمنفعة ؟ انها سخرية عظيمة، أن تكون منظّر للجسد القوي وانت تملك جسدا منهكا، أن تطمح للفروسية والحرب وانت عاجز عن ركوب حصان. مات في عمر 56، أي أنه قضى 12 سنة وهو في حالة من الهذيان والجنون، حتى أن اخته استغلت هذا الوضع بشكل غير اخلاقي، وبدأت تستغل كتب نيتشه ومخطوطاته ورسائله وكل متعلقاته بل وتستغله هو أيضا كجسد دون عقل من اجل الدعاية والبروباغاندا، وتنظم الحفلات والزيارات، وتكتب المقالات والكتب عن أخيها. الشيء الذي جعلها تكسب مالا كثيرا يأتيها من متبرعين محبين للفيلسوف الذي انهار عقله وكذلك من الكتب التي باتت تنشر وتطبع في كل انحاء العالم.الكتاب يحتوي على تفاصيل كثيرة، وتحيط بحياة نتشه بطريقة غير مسبوقة، وجدت بعض الاسهاب أحيانا في التوصيف الدقيق لبعض الامكنة او بعض الاشخاص الثانويين في حياة نيتشه، لكنها سيرة شاملة، حاولت في النهاية انصاف نيتشه والدفاع عنه وتبرئته من النازية والفاشية، كما حاولت تصويرة على كونه شخصا وديعا يمكن أن يرق لحصان حين يشاهد صاحبه وهو يجلده. كل منا مدعو للقراءة عن حياة هذا الرجل الذي كانت فلسفته مرحلة فاصلة في تاريخ اوروبا، وكل من يدرس فلسفته بعمق يدرك مدى التأثير الفكري الذي مارسه.اقتباسات : ""بروح الموسيقى وحسب، يمكننا أن ندرك النشوة التي ينطوي عليها إفناء الذات"". ""ان الهدف بعيد جدا، وحتى لو وصله المرء فسيصل مستنزفا كل قواه في مسعاه وكفاحه المضني. عندما يصل المرء الى الحرية يكون مرهقا مثل ذبابة تزول ما ان يحل المساء"". ""دع الروح الشابة تنظر الى الحياة وتتساءل، ما الذي أحببته حقا حتى الان ؟ ما الذي حلق بروحك عاليا ؟ ما الذي روض روحك وأسعدها في الوقت نفسه ؟ رتب هذه المواضيع المبجلة أمامك فربما ستمنحك طبيعتها وتسلسلها قانونا، قانونا أساسيا لذات الحقيقية"" ""اذا كنت راغبا في تحسين مستوى الناس فأعطهم طعاما افضل بدلا من القاء الخطب، ان الانسان هو ما يأكله""""يجب ان يكون المرء سريعا ويجب ان يرقص، فالحياة ليست بسهلة. ان تجرأ المرء يوما على تشييد بناء يحاكي الروح، فسيتعين عليه ان يتخذ المتاهة نموذجا. ليلد المرء نجما راقصا، يجب عليه أولا ان يمتلك فوضى داخله. الاختلاف وتغيير الرأي والحث على التساؤل، كل هذه واجبات، فالراي الثابت هو رأي ميت، والقرار الثابت هو قرار ميت لا يساوي حشرة ولا علاج له سوى السحق بالاقدام والتدمير الكامل"""

Anders als Lou Salomes oder Rüdiger Safranskis Nietzsche-Biographie, die ihren Schwerpunkt auf dem Inhalt von Nietzsches Schriften legen, zeichnet dieses Buch ein lebendiges Bild von Nietzsches Lebenswandel. Und das ist gut. Denn gerade in der inhaltlichen Aufarbeitung und Deutung der Werke liegt die Schwäche dieser Biographie. Zwar missdeutet die Autorin selten etwas, aber trifft doch selten den wirklichen Kern eines Werks. Auch findet (zum Glück wohl) kaum eine Gesamtdeutung von Nietzsches Denken statt, mal von der Betonung Nietzsches als Philosophen des „Vielleicht“ abgesehen und einigen etwas pathetischen Schlussbemerkungen zum Ende des Buches.Über die persönlichen und alltäglichen Hintergründe, die dem Entstehen der unterschiedlichen Schriften zugrunde liegen, konnte ich viel Neues lernen. Insbesondere das Verhältnis zu Wagner und Lou Salome wird sehr eindringlich beschrieben.Kritisch äußert sich die Autorin so gut wie nie gegenüber Nietzsche, viele besonders kontroverse Aussagen werden gar nicht erwähnt. Im Ganzen verfolgt die Autorin aber eine gute Intention, indem sie an der weiterhin benötigten Lösung von Nietzsches Denken aus dem Nazi-Sumpf arbeitet, in den Nietzsches Schwester ihren Bruder in jahrelanger Arbeit gebracht hat.(Nur ein kleiner Fehler ist mir aufgefallen (ca. Seite 466), wenn sie die Figur des Verrückten mit der Laterne im Zarathustra verortet, obwohl es sich dabei um den Tollen Menschen (Nr. 125) aus der Fröhlichen Wissenschaft handelt)Dieses Werk ist philosophisch dünn, aber in der Beschreibung des Lebenswandels Nietzsches so reich und farbenfroh wie vermutlich keine andere Biographie.

107,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Another in the long line of individuals who’s philosophical framework was misused, misquoted, taken out of context for an ulterior motive, in this case, the worst human atrocity in history. As mentioned in the book, “Ernst Krieck, a prominent Nazi ideologue, sarcastically remarked that apart from “the fact that Nietzsche was not a socialist, not a nationalist and opposed to racial thinking, he could have been a leading National Socialist thinker.” Yet his writings are seen throughout the Nazi world. Before reading this book, I didn’t know much about Nietzsche save for small tidbits, certainly had no idea that it was his sister who was behind the wheel, driving the German Nationalist Bandwagon straight to Hitler’s doorstep. “I am frightened’, Nietzsche had written, ‘by the thought of what unqualified and unsuitable people may invoke my authority one day. Yet that is the torment of every great teacher of mankind: he knows that, given the circumstances and the accidents, he can become a disaster as well as a blessing to mankind.” He knew beforehand what may come of his words, not likely to the degree that they did as he wrote them decades before WW1. He admitted as much when he declared the namesake of this book, “I am dynamite!” Insinuating his words had that potential energy in them … Great read! Gotta be in the mood certainly for this one but would give it my highest recommendation. Cheers to The Philosopher of ‘Perhaps’"

Sue Prideaux has shone a light on every aspect of his life you've always wanted to know more about, from his relationship with his mother and sister to his apostasy; from his friendship with Lou Salome to the conception of his philosophy; and, finally, to his eventual insanity and early death.This book comes with a warning, though: Nietzsche lived a very isolated, very depressing life that was punctuated by lengthy periods of severe illness. Success - if it can even be called that - came late in life to him, and as such the book is at times a difficult read emotionally. It is, however, quite brilliant as a resource and a biography. "
109,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Unless you're new to Nietzsche won't tell you much you didn't know about the philosophy, but on the man it's brilliant. A lost wandering klutz without a political bone in his body and a head full of brilliant, if not always palatable, thoughts. I emerged more sympathetic to the man and the philosophy both: Nietzsche emerges as a cosmopolitan European dismayed by narrow nationalism and anti-semitism that surrounds him (the Wagner crowd, his sister Elizabeth). He's always slightly at a tangent to events and the in-crowds. The book is also hilarious on the Wagners and the high camp of King Ludwig. And Elizabeth's attempts to control Nietzsche after he had lost his reason and to distort his legacy will make you angry too (she gives his walking stick to Hitler, who hardly read Nietzsche and who Nietzsche would have despised). There will be better and more in-depth books about Nietzsche out there, but this is great storytelling. "

Se lee como si fuera una novela, alude a las personas, lugares y acontecimientos de la vida de Nietzsche con mucha precisión.

I want to point out all the inspirations, and all the nonsense too. But that wasn't the point of this book. This was a biography, and as far as I can tell it's a good one. There were times when I thought I was reading a biography of Wagner, but given N's obsession with the man, I suppose that was unavoidable. Nietzsche was a man in desperate search for meaning and purpose. He said something to the effect that all philosophy is autobiography. Now that I've read his biography, I no longer feel the need to read his philosophy. This book puts his work into context, and that context was a litany of misery. Which isn't to say that he has nothing to offer, but rather that small doses are more than enough, to be tasted and rinsed rather than swallowed. "
112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030419-fraser-kinnear,Rating 3 out of 5,"I think most philosophers would argue that their theories are timeless, universal statements, and disconnected from their own lives; more like mathematics or physics than art. Nietzsche in his own writing clearly rejects this idea, and this stormy biography makes that point all the more evident.This interconnectedness between the particulars of Nietzsche’s life and experience and his ideas seem to be a core “feature” of romantic thought in a time when they were deemed “bugs” by his contemporaries. Even down to his polemic writing style, which was widely panned as disorganized, unscientific, and unconvincing from no less than his close friend Wagner.We herald him as an original thinker, but Nietzsche really a product of his era, environment, and as Prideaux argues, his biology. As she (or perhaps N.?) puts it: “all philosophy is autobiography.” Some observations were distillations of ideas that were in the air, such as this one, written 25 years after Marx: “Men are allowed only the precise amount of culture which is compatible with the interests of gain.”Nietzsche argued in aphorisms, provoking readers with ideas rather than explaining through systemic arguments. I suppose we are to treat this like we do Plato’s Socrates – a man who from whom we can learn an approach, but if only to struggle against. As Prideaux puts it:Distrusting all system builders, Nietzsche steadfastly refuses to build a system for us. He loves to contradict himself in the realm of ideas, and to force us in to the position of the free spirit who is independent of him. To establish if one is ready for independence, one must not cling to anything, not even a sense of one’s own detachment. And there’s loads of struggles which I think time has proven Nietzsche has lost. For one, empiricism: “Science annihilates myth. As a result, we fall into a senile, unproductive love of existence.” For another, his total disregard for and rejection of mathematics is to deny an entire universe of reflection and existence.Elsewhere, his embarrassing misogyny seems to make him helplessly anachronistic. In today’s age of search, permanent storage, and a medium of sound bites, we hold each other to cripplingly high standards of consistency. Can we tolerate these lapses? The biography offers even more light, as we learn that many of these outbursts are directed to female members of Nietzsche’s life, such as the “Of the Tarantulas” section in Zarathustra, which were directed barbs of his female family member, and to the lay reader confusing digressions from the plot.Prideaux spends a lot of time on Nietzsche’s villainous sister, whose delusions of racist grandeur led her to first found a failed German colony in Paraguay and then take control of her poor brother’s life and estate as he slid into insanity. Ironically, Elisabeth Nietzsche’s ambitious strivings and Will to Power reads very much like the Übermensch prototype that Frederich Nietzsche was groping for.Prideaux disagrees, arguing “He saw the principals on which Nueva Germania was founded as contemporary expressions of the slave mentality. Fatherland-ism, super-patriotism, and antisemitism simply masked the jealous, vengeful ressentiment of the impotent.” I’m not convinced. Elsewhere, she points out that Nietzsche admired Napoleon, calling him “the last great immoralist”.Many of his ideas are very clever, and by my temperament I have enjoyed them in other flavors. Niezsche’s Eternal Recurrance resembles (and of course predates) Camus’s Myth of Sisyphus. And his theorizing over Master and Slave morality is a brilliant sociological study of the Abrahamic religions. “It poisoned the world by denying the realities of human nature, turning everything into a conflict between ‘ought’ and ‘is’”Through this book, I’ve come to accept that I’m never going to like Zarathustra, and that I really just need to read “Beyond Good and Evil”, “The Genealogy of Morality”, “The Birth of Tragedy” and “The Twilight of the Idols”.Lastly, here’s some disordered notes that I enjoyed and wanted to get down:-Check out Nietzsche’s favorite influences: Emerson, Empedocles, Friedrich Hölderlin- “Become what you are having learned what that is” – Pindar- Wagner’s antisemitism may have been envy of Meyerbeer and Mendelsson- “Almost everyting we call ‘higher culture’ is based on the spiritualization and deepening of cruelty… Cruelty is what constitutes the painful sensuality of tragedy. And what pleases us in so-called tragic pity as well as in everything sublime, up to the highest and most delicate of metaphysical trembling, derives its sweetness exclusively from the intervening component of cruelty” – Beyond good and evil- “Luke 18:14 improved. - He that humbleth himself wants to be exalted”- “Pity is decadent, it is the practice of nihilism, it negates life”- “Is man god's mistake or is god man's mistake?”- Nietzsche was “only ever interested in man as an individual, not as a herd animal”- Prideaux’s summary of Nietzsche’s two goals… First: man must become himself; Second: amor fati- “Opinions and Fish. We are possessors of our opinions as of fish — that is, in so far as we are possessors of a fish pond. We must go fishing and have luck — then we have our fish, our opinions. I speak here of live opinions, of live fish. Others are intent to possess a cabinet of fossils — and, in their head, ""convictions”- “no one talks more passionately about his rights than he who in the depths of his soul doubts whether he has any”"

We are meant to find the meaning and the answer, if there is one, for ourselves; this is the true accomplishment of the Übermensch""""Tragically for Nietzsche, the need to overcome ourselves so blatantly distorted into the need to overcome others that it has tended to overshadow his ability to ask the eternal questions in such a gloriously provocative way.

On one hand, I think it's an extraordinary biography of Nietzsche and I doubt anyone can put together a better one. If you're after a highly detailed biography of Nietzsche's life, from birth until death and don't mind having to read / listed to all the little details, then this book is definitely for you! On the other hand, as someone looking for a good background, overview and introduction to Nietzsche and his works, I am only partially pleased with the book. This is also the primary reason for the 4 stars. Because it's an incredible book about Nietzsche's life! No less, but also no more.Positives:(1) As I mentioned, it gives an extraordinary insight into his life. I feel that I could answer any trivia questions about Nietzsche after going through this book. Negatives:(1) The book is long, very long and very detailed, which I feel is too much for what most people would want to get out of it.(2) Even though the book is long, it focuses so much on little details of Nietzsche's life that it does not say much about his actual works. They are, of course, mentioned, but not to any depth that I would've liked to learn about. What I wanted to get out of this book is an understanding of his life's work and what each of his books were about, and, even though I spent so many hours listening to this book, I don't think I got that."

For the most part, this book succeeds, but it does something even more important: it will make you re-think all you think you know about Nietzsche. His philosophy, his written works, his record...frankly, they are less than the sum of their parts. His sister and the Nazis have turned him into a champion for their anti-Semitic, twisted-eugenics nightmares...and he is nothing of the sort.

Prideaux'n teksti on välillä niin lennokasta, että välillä pistää jopa epäilemään, onko kirjailija vähän värittänyt filosofin tarinaa. Katkelmat Nietzschen omista kirjeistä ja muista teksteistä kuitenkin vakuuttavat, että lennokasta on ollut lähdemateriaalikin.Tämä on kyllä suositeltavaa luettavaa kaikille, jotka haluavat kevyen johdatuksen ja tarttumapintaa Nietzscheen.

Prideaux does a great job of tracing the threads of Nietzsche's thought across his life and work, weaving them into a compelling story. The book ends with a brilliant refutation of the misconception that his ideas constitute a serious precursor to national socialism. Prideaux celebrates Nietzsche's strengths (especially his foresight and famously sharp writing style) without shrinking from the less endearing aspects of his work and life (his occasional bouts of misogyny, failure to marry and bombastic excesses). This is certainly worth reading for those who want an introduction to Nietzsche's ideas (many of his most famous aphorisms are included verbatim) or want to understand the man behind the ideas."

I do know, however, all his work and I am highly impressed by his genius! How his ideas were decades ahead of his own Zeitgeist. How he seemed to see right through all the human flaws and deceptions of the church and powerful, that want to keep the small man small. His ideas are even ahead of some people’s ideas these days! The language of the book is beautiful and poetic, which makes it enticing to listen to.I really got into Nietzsches’s story, and can’t wait to read one of his pieces. "

والفيلسوف والشاعر الألماني فريدريك هولدرلین.في عام 1861، كتب مقالا مدرسيا وعنونه «رسالة إلى صديقي، وفيها أوصيته بقراءة ما يكتب شاعري المفضل». كان فريدريك هولدرلین شاعره المفضل، شاعرا مهملا ولم يكن معروفا على نطاق واسع آنذاك، رغم أنه يعتلي الآن بانثيون الأدب الألماني. حصل نيتشه على درجة متدنية على هذا المقال، ونصحه معلمه في أن يلتزم بالشعراء الأكثر مقبولية ووضوحا وتشبثا بهويتهم الألمانية . في الحقيقة، صحيح أن هولدرلين كان ألمانيا، ولكنه كان يمقت القومية الألمانية المتعالية. تبنى نيتشه البالغ من العمر سبعة عشر عاما ذات الموقف، وأشار مقاله إلى أن هولدرلين «يضع الألمان أمام الحقائق المرة التي، لسوء الحظ، ترتكز على أسس عميقة جدا في النهاية... ينتقد هولدرلين البربرية الألمانية قاذفا إياها بالكلمات الحادة والقاطعة. ومع ذلك، فإن هذا الاشمئزاز من الواقع ينسجم مع حبه الكبير لبلده، لكن ما کرهه في الألمان هو شريحة المتخصصين السطحيين والعوام.لقد وجه معلمو نيتشه سهام الكراهية إلى هولدرلين لأنهم اعتبروه انحطاطا صحيا سيئ التأثير على نيتشه على الصعيدين العقلي والأخلاقي. فقد هولدرلين عقله في نهاية حياته وهذا ما جعله خيارا غير صحي لأن يكون موضوع مقال. جاءت لذة نيتشه في التشكيك بسلطة العقل متحدة مع اشتباه المعلمين بأن الصبي يحمل روحا تشاؤمية خطيرة تتعارض كليا مع المبادئ الإرشادية ليفورتا وهي الويسنشافت والبيلدانغ واللوثرية. من الواجب أن توفر هذه المبادئ الثلاثة المقدسة خطا دفاعا مناسبا أمام أي طالب يافع مثل نيتشه ينجذب للأرض المزعزعة للروح البائسة التي يستكشفها هولدرلين:آها، تحتقرون من يعي كل هذا، والذي - کما أنا - لا يستطيع أن يمنحكم حرية الحديث عن جدوى وجود الإنسان، والذي - کما أنا – يقبع في قبضة العدم الذي يحكم وجودنا، ولذلك ندرك بعمق أننا ولدنا عدما، وأننا نحب عدما، ونؤمن بالعدم، ونجهد أنفسنا حتى الموت من أجل العدم، وفي النهاية نمضي رويدا رويدا نحو العدم - کيف باستطاعتي تقديم المساعدة إذا ما انهارت ركبكم تحت ثقل التفكير بهذا الأمر جدا؟ لقد غرق كثيرا في لجج هذه الأفكار التي لا قعر لها، وصرخت؛ لماذا تصوبين فأس على جذوري، يا أيتها الروح عديمة الرحمة؟ - وما زلنا». كان هولدرلين في سنوات حياته الأخيرة، بين الفينة والأخرى، قادرا على إنتاج نصوص ذات بصيرة مدهشة، أو التماعة نبوئية أو عبارة مثيرة للقلق بشكل غريب. أقام في برج في توبنغن، حيث أصبح محطة جذب سياحية، فقرة في جدول جولة العصر الرومانسي الكبرى، وأفضل ما فيها رؤية برج متهالك مليء بالبوم ومسكون بالرجل الشبيه بالشاري (مانع الصواعق) التي تشتت الإلهام السماوي. کتب نيتشه، إن «قبر الجنون طويل الأمد» الذي سكنه هولدرلين وتصارع فيه عقله مع ليل الجنون الذي خيم عليه متسارعا، قبل أن يفضي في النهاية إلى أغان جنائزية كئيبة وغامضة، تتغذى على وعيه مثل أمواج تتلاطم في بحر مضطرب. تقرأ كتابات نیتشه عن هولدرلين على أنها تلميحات، وكأنه يوشك أن يقع في حب فكرا هجر عقله فعلا، إذا ما كان عاقبة هذا الهجر هو فتح مصاريع الإلهام.من المؤكد، أن هولدرلين لم يكن الموضوع المفضل في بفورتا، ولكن نیتشه لم يتخل عن اهتمامه بالشاعر على الرغم من انتقادات أساتذته واستنكارهم**نيتشة وقصة في بيت الدعارة يتردد أعضاء أخوية فرانكونيا على بيوت الدعارة في كولونيا. زار نیتشه المدينة في شباط من عام 1865 مستخدما مرشدا سياحيا ليريه الكاتدرائية والمناظر الشهيرة في المدينة. طلب من الدليل أن يأخذه لأحد المطاعم وربما ظن المرشد أن نيتشه خجول جدا ولن يطلب الذهاب إلى الأماكن التي يرغب بزيارتها فعلا، ولذلك أخذه إلى أحد بيوت الدعارة بدلا من المطعم؛ «فجأة وجدت نفسي محاطا بنصف دزينة من مخلوقات ترتدي ثيابا مبهرجة وشفافة تحدقن بي بطريقة تدل على انتظارهن إياي. للحظة، وقفت أمامهن والذهول باد علي؛ ثم ذهبت إلى البيانو كما لو كانت غریزتي تدفعني إليه، فقد كان الشيء الوحيد الذي يمتلك روحا في هذه المؤسسة بأكملها، فعزفت على مفتاح أو مفتاحين فيه. حررت الموسيقى أطرافي وللفور کنت خارجا في الخلاء».هذا كل ما نعرفه عن هذه الواقعة ولكنها ذات صدى مدو في الأدب النيتشوي وأسطورته. يعتقد البعض أنه لم يعزف على بعض الأوتار وحسب ليترك المكان عند هذا الحد، ولكنه مكث في بيت الدعارة فترة أطول من أجل ممارسة الغرض الاعتيادي حيث أصيب هناك بمرض الزهري، وبسبب هذا المرض انبثقت مشكلاته العقلية والجسدية لاحقا. هناك سبب آخر يؤكد هذا الشيء، هو قوله عام 1889 ، بعد أن فقد عقله وكان في المصحة، أنه قد «أصيب مرتين». افترض الأطباء أنه كان يتحدث عن مرض السفلس، لكنهم لو نظروا إلى سجلاته الطبية لكانوا اكتشفوا أنه قد أصيب بالسيلان مرتين، وهي حقيقة اعترف بها للأطباء حينها كان سليم العقل. ** عن كتاب إنساني مفرط في انسانيته أطلق نیتشه على كتاب إنساني مفرط في إنسانيته أثرا تذكاريا لأزمة، ولا يقصد هنا أزمة الفجوة الايدولوجية بينه وبين فاغنر فقط، بل أزمة القرف من السنوات العشر الماضية لمهنته التدريسية الأكاديمية المغبرة. متطلعا إلى الوراء، شعر بالغضب من زجه مبكرا جدا في وظيفة لم يكن مؤهلا لشغلها، فقد أكسبه العمل في الفيلولوجيا إحساسا بالفراغ والجوع الذي لا يستطيع ملئه أو إشباعه إلا بواسطة الرقية الفاغنرية المخدرة. بيد أن الحلم الموسيقي الأفيوني لم يكن وسيلة لإشباع شره الواقع، لقد مثل كتاب إنساني مفرط في إنسانيته بداية رحلته الفلسفية في البحث عن الروح الحرة، والإنسان القادر على إشباع جوعه الوجودي رغم غياب المثل الأعلى أو الإلهي، ورغم تأثره بالسمو الموسيقي.إن «إنساني مفرط في إنسانيته» هو كتاب نيتشه الأول الذي يكتب بأسلوب الشذرات المرقمة. مدفوعا للكتابة بهذه الطريقة المتقطعة المتجزئة بسبب وضعه الصحي الفظيع، حول نيتشه علته إلى تریاق، وعرف من خلال الكتابة أن الشذرة هي عامل حث ونقطة انطلاق ومحفز للمستقبل والتساؤلات العميقة. لقد وسم الكتاب بداية ظهور نیتشه بصفته مفكرا وكاتبا ذا أسلوب رفيع أصيل.أرسل النص المكتمل من الجزء الأول (وسيكون هناك جزء آخر) إلى ناشره شمتزنر في منتصف كانون الثاني من عام 1878، برفقة قائمة من التعليمات التفصيلية. ومنها، يجب أن ينشر الكتاب بالتزامن مع الذكرى المئوية لوفاة فولتير في الثلاثين من أيار، ولا يجب الإعلان عن الكتاب بأية طريقة، لأنه سينشر باسم مستعار لكي لا تعترض الزمر التي تقف مع أو ضد نیتشه طريق الكتاب متحيزين له أو رافضين. يجب أن يظهر المؤلف على غلاف الكتاب باسم «برنارد کرون»، وضمن نيتشه الكتاب سيرة ذاتية مزيفة لكرون لتطبع في المادة الدعائية.**في 2 مارس 1878، استقال رسميا من منصبه التدریسی، متعللا بصحته السيئة. أمل في أن يكون أطباؤه محقين عندما قالوا إن التدريس والكتابة مسؤولان عن صحته المعطوبة. كان يلوم أغاني فاغنر الصادحة؛ «جعلتني كتاباتي وتفكيري الذي ينطوي على مشكلات معقدة حتى الآن عليلا دوما؛ طالما كنت باحثا فعليا وكانت صحتي على ما يرام، ثم جاءت الموسيقى فيها بعد لتتلف أعصابي مع الفلسفة الميتافيزيقية والقلق حول آلاف الأشياء التي لا تعنيني بالمرة..». فكر أنه عندما يرمي عن كاهله أعباء الكتابة والتفكير، من المؤكد أنه سيستعيد صحته البدنية.في الثلاثين من حزيران، قبلت الجامعة استقالته، مانحة إياه معاشا تقاعديا قدره ثلاثين ألف مارك سويسري لمدة ست سنوات، ولأنه لم يقم بصورة مستمرة في سويسرا على مدار ثماني سنوات، فإنه لم يكن مؤهلا ليصبح مواطنا سويسرا. رحب بوضع اللامنتمي الذي عاشه من دون هوية أحوال مدنية. ومن هذا الموضع بإمكانه فهم الأخلاق العالمية وإعادة تشکیل مفهومي الخير والشر استنادا إلى تقييم جديد للحياة، متحررا من أي استعارات تقبلية للآراء الجديدة، ولربما أصبح أخيرا روحا حرةمقلدا هولدرلین رمز طفولته البطولي، حدد برجا قديما على أسوار ناومبورغ حيث كان سيعيش متقشقا ويعمل بستانیا، لكن الأمر استغرق ستة أسابيع فقط ليدرك أن البستاني يحتاج ظهرا قويا ونظرا ثاقبا، وهكذا بدأت سنوات تجوله.إن غابة تويتوبورغ الأسطورية، التي كانت مسرحا شهد هزيمة الفيالق الرومانية على يد القبائل الجرمانية، تمنح المرء الظلمة الأكثر حلكة مسببة أكبر قدر من الارتياح. شاقا طريقه بين الظلال الموحشة، ملا نيتشه اثني عشر دفترا من دفاتر ملاحظاته التي توضع في الجيب، مدونا أفكاره بطريقة أطلق عليها «اسلوب البرقية اللعين»، وهي الطريقة الوحيدة التي يمكنه من خلالها ��تابة انفجاراته الفكرية البليغة التي تندفع بين نوبات الصداع، على الرغم من أن ناشره قد كتب يخبره سلفا أن سوق الكتب قد تشبع بكتب الشذرات المختصرة وعليه تغيير أسلوبه النثري فعليا، إن كان يرغب في كسب القراء.بالرغم من النصيحة، أرسل نيتشه إلى شمتزنر «آراء وحكم متنوعة» والمتجول وظله»، مجموعتين مؤلفتين من عدة مئات من الشذرات، اللتين لحقتا «إنساني مفرط في إنسانيته»، كما أرسل كتابا مكتملا مؤلفا من 585 شذرة أسماه «الفجر» (Morgenrate)، وعنوانه الثانوي «أفكار حول الإجحاف الاخلاقي». تراوحت الأفكار التي تضمنها الكتاب من أخلاقيات التربیت على الكلب إلى أكثر التأملات النموذجية عند نیتشه حول فاغنر والإرادة الحرة والحرية الفردية والدين والدولة.سلك نيتشه في كتاب الفجر طريق المادية إلى أبعد نقطة فيه، فقد كتبه خلال احدى فترات اهتمامه بالتفكير العلمي المعاصر، إلى جانب اكتشافه الفيلسوف القرن السابع عشر اليهودي إسبينوزا. «لقد اصبحت عزلتي الآن عزلة تتسع لشخصين! إنني مندهش فعلا، ومسرور حقا! لقد عثرت على النذير المبشر!». كتب قصيدة أهداها لإسبينوزا، فقد رأى فيه مرآة تعكس إنكاره للإرادة الحرة والغايات والشر والنظام الأخلاقي اللا- أناني العالمي... لا شك في أن الاختلافات هائلة، غير أن أكثر هذه الاختلافات ناتجة عن الاختلاف في الفترة الزمنية والثقافة والحقل المعرفي الذي يشتغلان فيه». بالإضافة إلى إسبينوزا، قرأ كتاب روبرت مایر «ميكانيكا الحرارة ونظرية بوسكوفيتش عن الذرات غير المادية، وكتاب «القوة والمادة» (1855) للطبيب المادي لودفيغ بوخنر الذي طرح کتابه، الأكثر مبيعا، الإنجيل أرضاه من خلال قوله «إن أبحاث واكتشافات العصر الحديث لم تعد تسمح لنا بعد أن نشك في حقيقة أن الإنسان، بما يمتلك ويتملك، سواء عقليا أو جسديا، هو منتج طبيعي ككل الكائنات العضوية الأخرى»، بينما أكد كتاب لانغ في تأريخ المادية» **نيتشة ودوستويفسكيتعود قصة إنبهار وحديث نيتشة بدوستويفسكي ، بقصة الشابة ميتا فون سالیس مارشلینز؛ كانت ميتا السمراء الجذابة الأرستقراطية آخر فرد في عائلة مارشلینز السويسرية النبيلة الغنية، وقد تجاوز عقلها وعزمها عظمة نسبها النبيل، وهي تصغر نيتشه بعشر سنوات، واحدة من النساء الجديدات» النسويات اللواتي يدافعن عن حياة فكرية مستقلة كالويدا فون میسنبوغ. درست ميتا القانون والفلسفة في جامعة زيوريخ، وخلال العام السابق أصبحت أول امرأة سويسرية تحصل على الدكتوراه. كانت تكتب الشعر وتطالب بإفساح المجال للنساء، لكن ليس كل النساء، فانتقائيتها النسوية تليق حقا بالراديكالية الأرستقراطية. لم تكن مهتمة أبدا بسعادة القطيع، بل بتضمين نساء الطبقة النبيلة ذوات الذكاء الفطري أيا كانت أصولهن في الحقوق المدنية، فمن شأن هذا أن يجعل العالم أكثر أرستقراطية وليس أكثر ديمقراطية، مطبقة مبدأها هذا على الرجال كما النساء. في مذكراتها حول نيتشه، صنفته ضمن النخبة؛ أولئك الذين تفوق فكرهم النبيل على أصولهم المتواضعة.تحدثا عن دوستويفسكي، وتبين أن ميتا قد قرأت أعماله بناء على توصية من ناتالي هيرزين، تلك الفتاة التي اعتقد نيتشه أنها قد تكون عروسا مناسبة له لو أنها امتلكت المال. حكی نیتشه کیف أنه اكتشف دوستويفسكي بالصدفة، عند التقاطه نسخة فرنسية من رواية «رسائل من تحت الأرض» من مكتبة ما. كالصدفة التي جعلته يعرف شوبنهاور عندما كان في الحادية والعشرين من عمره، وستاندال عندما بلغ الخامسة والثلاثين، كانت صدفة تعرفه على دوستويفسکی أشبه بصاعقة رعدية. كانت کلماته «مقطوعة موسيقية، موسیقی أجنبية وليست ألمانية البتة». بنظرة عبقرية ذات بعد سیکولوجی دفع الكتاب الأول نیتشه ليبحث عن المزيد، فقرأ «منزل الأموات» النسخة الفرنسية أيضا. كان لوصف دوستويفسكي المؤثر والقاسي لسنواته الطويلة التي قضاها في السجن والمنفى في سيبيريا تأثيرا قويا على نيتشه، فصرخ قائلا: «ابن بيتك قرب فیزوف»، وهذا كان تأثير دوستويفسكي. لقد كان شيطان الحقيقة وشيطان الوضوح، وحشا کاسرا ومغامر روح، رجلا ماثلت معاناته معاناة نيتشه، فالمهانة التي عاشها دیستويفسكي خلال سنواته في السجن شابهت الذل الذي قاساه نيتشه خلال سنوات طويلة من المرض والإهمال الأدبي.أشترك دوستويفسكي في كل تلك النقاط مع نيتشه، إلى جانب المعرفة الشاملة بالأناجيل الماثلة لمعرفة نيتشه. لقد كان قادرا على استعراض المسيحية الخام الأصيلة، تلك الحالة الدينية المقدسة قبل انتزاعها من براءتها بكل الإدخالات والتفسيرات اللاحقة. كان دوستويفسكي فوضويا مقدسا فهم أن سایکولوجيا المخلص الحقيقية لا علاقة لها بالكهنة أو دين الدولة أو النظام، ولا ترتبط بنزعة الانتقام التي تتمحور حولها أخلاق العبيد، كانت محاولات تبرير المسيحية «علميا» لا علاقة لها بتائا بموضوع المسيحية. لقد انحرفت المسيحية عن مسارها بتأثير هذه الأمور، فشعر نیتشه بأنهما يتشاركان الرأي بأن المسيحية قد تلوثت بفعل إرثها الذي يسمى «الدين»، فخضعت المساومة مقابل ضرورة دوامها في هذا العالم، وهي ضرورة لا يمكن إلا أن تحول المخلص إلى مهرج تقي.بينما كان نيتشه و میتا فون سالیس مارشلينز يتنزهان مساء على طول البحيرة باتجاه صخرة زرادشت، قالت إن الدموع ملأت عيني نيتشه وهو يتحدث عن «منزل الأموات»، فأخبرها أن الرواية دفعته إلى أن يدين سلسلة كاملة من المشاعر القوية في نفسه، ليس لأنه لم يكن يتملكها، بل لأنه شعر بها تجتاحه بقوة وعمق شدید، عالما مدى خطورتها. لم تخبرنا ميتا عن ماهية هذه المشاعر، لكن من المفترض أنه كان يتحدث عن التأثير الخطير والمنهك للشفقة وعدم جدواها من الناحية العملية. كتب بعد فترة وجيزة أن الشفقة انحطاط وممارسة عدمية تجب الحياة وتدفع الناس إلى ترجيح كفة العدم، رغم أنه لا يسمى العدم ب«الماوراء» أو «الإله» أو «الحياة الحقيقية » أو «النيرفانا» أو «الخلاص». أدرك أرسطو هذا كله وأعلن أنه يعتبر الشفقة مرضا خطيرا يجب التطهر منه في النظام من حين إلى حين. كانت التراجيديا الإغريقية هي العلاج لهذا المرض.

I definitely learned more about Nietzsche's life and the context of his philosophy than I knew before. In other ways it never got into a steady flow. The writing, while mostly good, at times felt unnecessarily flowery. Most importantly, it lacked a resonant trajectory to both his life and his philosophy, which if intertwined more effectively could've brought the subject more closely down to earth. Maybe, through no fault of the author, it's just the case that Nietzsche's philosophy is more interesting than his life."

130,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57590131-anas,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sue Prideaux is best known for her Biography of Edvard Munch, the painter of “the Scream”. In this book she tackles the life of legendary German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.Freidrich Nietzsche is one of the most influential philosophers to come out of 19th century Germany. His work in philology and philosophy is to this day borrowed from, copied and studied. Another distinction that Nietzsche holds is that of his philosophy being thought of as intellectual backup for the Nazi regime’s ideology. It is thus an enormous breath of fresh air to the man himself, the reader and the world of philosophy that this biography sheds light on his life as well as his works.The least that could be said about the author is that she has done her homework when it came to writing this book. No stone has been left unturned.She has delved and pieced together fragments of his life in a way that would make any detective jealous. Every moment of his life is backed up by extensive research into his diaries, his letters and correspondence as well as his books, she illustrates how moments in his life came to be inspiration for his books, giving great resonance to Nietzsche’s idea that philosophy emanates first from the body.The book is divided into 22 chapters, each one carries you through Nietzsche’s life, his travels, his philosophy and how it came to be. Sue writes in a very smooth style, almost soft in very sharp contrast with the writings of Nietzsche. You are quickly captured by it and then it carries you throughout the book comfortably as if riding on a cloud. Her ideas are brief, clear, precise, they flow well and are very easy to follow. Any reader new to the world of philosophy or curious about Nietzsche himself will find great value in this book, whether it is aspects of his life or his thinking.The book also provides historical context to the ideas and the zeitgeist that were prevalent at the time. We get a clear picture of the settings where the people in the book evolved and why they had the ideas that they had, what fueled them and what they made of them. Providing historical insight and hindsight without transforming history into a tribunal is a greatly appreciated aspect in the book.Aside from having pretty much nothing to criticize, if maybe not enough pictures of Nietzsche, I would like to point out a key in a successful book and that is the self-effacement of the author in favor of the subject material itself. Sue Prideaux succeeded in doing that and obviously more than.A solid 5 stars.www.universalminds.co.uk"

Anyone with an interest in Nietzsche’s philosophy will appreciate this. It demystifies his philosophy and shows how linked it truly is to his biography. It’s quite sad, actually. It sets a lot of the record straight from the damage done to his legacy. I was left a bit wanting on some of his Whys, but the biographer can’t always fulfill that. I feel a deeper connection to his philosophy now, despite its lack of answers we now have some grist."
132,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is very much a portrait of Nietszche the man, rather than an analytical biography of him as a philosopher, and it is accessibly written in a slightly ironic voice, which makes it highly readable.The great works are discussed in passing but not in detail, and the main revelation here is that the famous aphoristic style was largely dictated by FN’s lifelong ill health and poor eyesight, and consequent inability to write for long periods of time (there is a whole section of these aphorisms at the end of the book – some of which should perhaps not be taken at face value, the author says).Nietzsche never married but there are some key relationships mentioned in the book. One is between FN and the Wagners, with whom he would regularly stay in their grand residence (he was, it seems, besotted with the great man’s wife as well as the great composer himself). They lived a bizarre existence, and FN would eventually fall out of with them over their fierce nationalist and anti-semitic views, which he found abhorrent and vulgar (he would, however, write a number of books about Wagner). Later, he would also form strong relationships with Lou Andreas Salome, a free-spirited Russian woman who would become a psychoanalyst and Paul Ree, the author, spending time travelling and planning a free-thinking commune with them. FN fell in love with her but this was unrequited, although Salome found his radical thoughts exciting. Generally, however, Nietzsche was extremely solitary and spent a lot of his life travelling alone, accompanied only by his huge trunk of books (the ‘Club Foot’), and his meagre belongings. His sister Elizabeth is the other key figure in the book and had tried to destroy his relation with Salome. Nicknamed ‘the Llama’, she was an extremely domineering and manipulative, as well as a proto-nazi, who once tried to set up a nationalist enclave called Nueva Germania in Paraguay [‘Llama land’ for FN] with some other fellow-Wagnerian anti-semites. This story is told with great hilarity, as they struggled up the mosquito-ridden river with her piano in tow, like something out of a Werner Herzog film. Most importantly, she became the person who would control FN’s works once he met his premature death, and manipulate his reputation.There is a full chapter on the famous mental collapse of FN in Turin, when he saw a horse being mistreated and put his arms around it, at which point he was taken away to a mental asylum and diagnosed with tertiary syphilis – though the author notes that this would usually kill a man fairly quickly and he managed a further 11 years of life, if not in good mental health. As soon as she heard about her brother’s illness, Elizabeth rushed back from Paraguay, leaving her Potemkin Community behind (her husband having committed suicide in despair), and set about taking control of her brother’s literary affairs. By 1893, interest in his work had suddenly taken off internationally and the redoubtable Elizabeth set about organising his vast array of illegible papers, letters and notes into an ‘archive’, which she took charge off in order to build his legend. She then took court action to become FN’s sole custodian, ousting his mother, and also produced a biography in 1895, when she also drew up a copyright contract to give her control of all his works, which the mother reluctantly signed over for a sum of money (FN himself died in 1900). From then until 1935, she controlled all his works, and letters, and the power to censor/edit them. After his death, Elizabeth spent her time inflating her own reputation through presenting her brother as a mystic prophet of her own [nationalist/Nazi] convictions – she never understood his revolutionary thoughts, but was still nominated for the Nobel prize for literature in 1908, bizarrely. As the biographer notes at the end of the book, 'his devotion to examining every facet of the truth and never recommending an answer beyond 'perhaps...' has afforded indefinite potential for interpretation.' I am not sure that this is a great introduction to Nietzsche's writings, but it is a fascinating account of an extraordinary life, and a great insight into a particular time in European history."
133,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76558642-johannes-vriend,Rating 4 out of 5,"This may be the best book I've read about Nietzsche so far. Prideaux has a quite rich, poetic writing style, fitting for the subject. Her knowledge of the correspondences between relatives of Nietzsche amazed me. Above that, she seemed to have a deep understanding of German history and culture. This book is a biography in the exact sense of the word: the description of a life. If you want to understand the philosophy itself, you should probably just read the original works by Nietzsche. But it most certainly does no harm to give this a go. Most of Nietzsche's stereotypes and predjudistic popular descriptions fall away when reading this. "
134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155441-chris,Rating 4 out of 5,"Structured like a tragedy, showing how Nietzsche spent most of his intellectual life actively resisting the forces of anti-Semitism, nationalism, and fascism in those around him, only to be made into a proto-Nazi hero when he was too insane to object. If he is the Othello, his sister Elizabeth is the Iago. She comes across in modern eyes as pretty purely villainous, first trying and failing to found a utopia of German racial purity in Paraguay with her racist husband, then recovering her tarnished name and reputation by taking control of her unwell brother and perverting his works and legacy. What surprised me was learning how much Nietzsche was surrounded by the seeds of Nazism a half-century before the Nazis came to power, and how he not only didn't engage but actively resisted them. I knew about his relationship with Wagner, but didn't know that he rebuffed him and split off when Wagner became consumed with ideas of nationalism and racial purity. Nietzsche actively sought cosmopolitan, anti-nationalist, and often Jewish interlocutors all his life. He's not seen as a really political philosopher, but political ideas undergirded a lot of his work. I wish a little more attention were given to his intellectual development rather than his personal life, but I recognize that's hard to balance and this does a pretty good job. The appendix of aphorisms curated under headers like ""Reality TV"" was cheapening and unnecessary, though I guess I see the intention. Overall, an engaging, clearly written biography of a very complex and curious figure."

First there is the madness in his family, the expectation that he will die or become mad before turning 45 years, the continued and increased physical sufferings, the loss of sight, and so on. Accordingly, he taunted insanity, he worked desperately and continuously, picked the aphorism as his form of expression, experienced his life as a cyclical process of deaths and renewals, wrote his books in very short periods of time and ecstatically, and so on. Then there is his passion for music and the profound relationship with Wagner. He worshiped Wagner when they met in his youth, but eventually turned against him. Most of his books can be understood vis-a-vis his relationship with Wagner. In this respect, it is interesting how the Third Reich appropriated both of them later. Because of his diseases, he was continuously on the move for a place to ease his pains. He abandoned Germany (mainly for Switzerland and Italy), traveled a lot, and was alone most of the time. He walked and hiked daily for hours. He conceived his main ideas while moving and outside - “Never trust a thought that occurs to you indoors.”When he socialized, he mingled with aristocrats – especially during his friendship with Wagner. No surprise that he was against mass culture, newspapers, democracy, and so on. There was a huge contrast between the meek, gentle, polite, delicate, and so on of the day-to-day Nietzsche and the Antichrist and the destroyer of entire metaphysical systems of the author Nietzsche. During his sane life - his books and ideas were not at all received and understood. Most of his books were published at his own expense and in extremely small numbers (in general 100 copies). His short teaching period was a disaster also. He stayed independent, believed in himself until the end, and pursued his ideas as far as he was able to do so without much interference from others. This is still a strong argument against the professional philosopher – especially one that also needs to publish as required by the job and the professional community - “Today as always, men fall into two groups: slaves and free men. Whoever does not have two-thirds of his day for himself, is a slave, whatever he may be: a statesman, a businessman, an official, or a scholar.”"

De estudante de teologia em crise, Nietzsche se torna professor de filologia na Basileia (1868). Desenvolve uma profunda amizade com Wagner e sua mulher. Escreve ""o nascimento da tragédia"" (a relação entre apolíneo e dionísio). É um fracasso de vendas. Nietzsche está sempre muito doente. Apaixona-se algumas vezes, mas não concretiza seus objetivos afetivos. Em busca de se tornar um espírito livre que busca satisfação existencial apesar da falta de transcendência, afasta-se de Wagner e abandona o magistério. Faz parceria intelectual com Rée e Lou. Esta entende que o projeto de Nietzsche é uma nova religião existencial. Lou se desentende com Elisabeth (irmã de Nietzsche). Ele se afasta de Lou e Rée. Escreve ""assim falava Zaratrusta"", texto que tinha o objetivo de ser uma obra magna. Wagner morre. Nietzsche se afasta de Elisabeth que, por sua vez, casa com um antissemita (Forster) e partem para o Paraguai a fim de inaugurar uma colônia antissemita. Nietzsche amplia o texto de Zaratustra e desenvolve o conceito de super homem. Em 1886 e 1887, Nietzsche escreve, respectivamente, ""além do bem e do mal"" e ""genealogia da moral"", textos radicalmente críticos às certezas de uma era sem Deus. O autor é sempre incomodado por suas doenças e por não receber o reconhecimento que achava que lhe era merecido. Com o tempo, depois de muitas críticas, recebe alguns elogios, e publica o ""caso Wagner"" e ""crepúsculo dos ídolos"". Depois publica ""o anticristo"" e ""ecce homo"" como parte de um projeto de uma nova religião. Nietzsche enlouquece e é internado. Elisabeth deixa a colônia (expulsa) e volta para casa. Nietzsche começa a ser lido e conhecido internacionalmente, ainda que não soubesse disso por estar em surto psicótico. Elisabeth se apropria de sua obra e usa o nome de Nietzsche para enriquecer. Nietzsche morre em meio a sofrimentos. Elisabeth aproxima a obra de Nietzsche ao nazismo. O texto de Prideaux é muito bem escrito. Nietzsche é um incontornável filósofo que, em sua rebelião contra Deus e os valores, teve uma vida de sofrimento e crises existenciais. "
137,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"The only Nietzsche book I've read so far is his Antichrist (I have the complete Zarathustra on my shelf, yet unopened), so I may have had a certain picture of the author of this angry book in my mind, supported by his popculture portrayal as a stern and nihilistic, always frowning and unapproachable man. Sue Prideaux made me think that he was anything but what I just described.The biography is centered around the relationships that defined this surprisingly normal, gentle and humane person - the one with Richard Vagner and his muse Cosima, with his mother and his sister (who is largely responsible for his loose associations with nazi ideology and antisemitism), Lou Salome and the many other men and women who either helped or hindered the often difficult births of his books or otherwise made their mark in his thinking or existence.Somewhat in parallel we see the gradual change from a not-so-interested young philologist enamored by Schopenhauer into an original philosopher, who shaped modern thinking and values, as well as the approach to examining them. It is enchanting to see the gradual formation and ripening of his thought, to see ""the magic happen"". His ever-failing health is an omnipresent drama by itself.We get the rough outlines of Nietzsche's thinking and a gentle introduction into the main points made in his works, which motivates me to finally read some of them.While obviously focusing on the persona of Nietzsche, I also enjoyed the book as a vibrant portrait of (surprisingly open and cosmopolitan) Europe in the latter half of the 19th century, since Nietzsche himself spent most of his years traveling back and forth between Germany, Switzerland, Italy and France.The book is a real page-turner (or it was for me at least) and I am strongly tempted to get Prideaux' biographies of Munch and Strindberg as well.All in all, I enjoyed my time with Nietzsche quite a lot. The only thing left unanswered - did he, in his madness, manage to see the other side?"

Τότε ήταν που γνώρισε τον μεγάλο μουσικοσυνθέτη και αναμορφωτή της όπερας, τον Ρίχαρντ Βάγκνερ και τη σύνευνή του, την Κόζιμα.Πράγματι, από το 1869 έως και το 1872, όταν ο Βάγκνερ συνέγραφε την περίφημη Τετραλογία του στην εξοχική βίλα του στο Τρίμπσεν κοντά στη Λουκέρνη της Ελβετίας, ο Νίτσε μοιράστηκε μαζί τους αξέχαστες στιγμές.

This one intrigued me, having read/ studied Nietzsche in my university years and being familiar with his philosophy but not at all with the details of his life (other than his final years and his collapse). The title is also a great choice for this one.Sue Prideaux delivers a fascinating read – the era and all its socioeconomical details come out in detail, the relationships in his life are shown in all their glory (and gore, for that matter), his thought emerges and is blended in his life. One of the successes of this book is that in showing Nietzsche’s life, it is also showing how much (or how little, in some cases) society has changed since then. For those not familiar at all with Nietzsche’s philosophy, you will get the chance to get acquainted with the birth of his original thinking and the main points of his view of the world, in a way that does not over complicate or confuse. This is a truly brilliant mind, an original thinker whose influence is much greater than he would ever imagine or even want for himself. It also provides ample clarification for his more contentious point, the Ubermensch – and how this was completely abused and misinterpreted by the Nazi regime - not without some help. He would have been appalled at this. This is wonderful read, with the right amount of nerd gossip (on Wagner, Lou Salome and the intelligentsia of the era), useful insights and an overview of one of the most important thinkers of the 19th century and beyond."

141,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8427267-janine-brouillette,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a very interesting biography on a man who I had heard of, but did not know that much about. The writer describes Nietzsche’s early upbringing, the death of his father with “softening of the brain”, his complex relationship with his mother and sister, Elizabeth, which carried on until his final breakdown, stroke, and death. His sister, who had strong Nazi beliefs, and who was a friend of Hitler’s was the curator and editor of the library of his work after his death which made it take an unintended slant immediately after his death but has since been corrected. Nietzche took inspiration from people such as Plato, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Richard Wagner. Prideaux wrote in great detail about Nietzsche almost obsession with Wagner, his music, and even his wife, Cosima. He spent much of his time with them at their villa Tribschen and was even there for the birth of their first child. He would send them his writings for review and would even compose music for them, although that was never well received. Prideaux does a good job of weaving his personal life, his philosophical thoughts, and even his periods of tormented mind. Another relationship that is featured in his life is that with Lou Salomé and Paul Ree.....and their time spent as the “unholy trinity”.....until they broke his heart. Sue Prideaux did a great job of researching and was very knowledgeable of his life, work, relationships, and philosophy, but being somewhat of a novice it seemed a little wordy and complicated in some parts."

143,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Of a life scorned and not celebrated, much has been made, without consent and with much aplomb. It's an incestuous little circle of pontificating spiders, snipping and cutting at this man's legacy, which was larger than life and certainly larger than one could see him to be when he was living. It was two world wars and an existential quarter life crisis in a world that knew it had to grow up that brought his name into the mouths of the future generation. But he suffered no pretensions; perhaps, as the author herself suggests, this gave him such universal appeal. A philosophy not lived is a dead one, like the idols that he smashed to pieces in promethean fury in the cave. He was like dynamite to the old order, the same thing which blasted holes in the European Order. But he never was involved in such worldly affairs. Having renounced his German citizenship, he was the first European, unbound and free. Perhaps he would love the European Union. Maybe he'd see them as clearly as he'd seen through the bombast of his former mentor Richard Wagner. Perhaps he would sniff them out, crush the tarantulas underfoot. Regardless, whatever he'd do, we are sure that it would be revolutionary, explosive in consequence, nonetheless."

Nietzsche's legacy has been reclaimed of late. I Am Dynamite is another work that sets the record straight on a number of popular misconceptions. From his childhood, to his madness, each episode of his life is covered in good detail. In particular, much was learned about the dynamic between Lou Salome, himself, Elizabeth. Yalom's focus on Salome in When Nietzsche Wept left me wanting to know more about this highly consequential relationship. Elizabeth is painted as the animal she is, the walking antithesis of everything Nietzsche stood for. It painfully demonstrates how the opprutunistic mediocre Elizabeth used her brother's fame for her own needs. From her foray as an antisemitic colonial in Paraguay to her taking control of Nietzsche's works fradulantly editing them, she emerges as one of the greatest villains for all time, and oddly relevant in contemporary times. Must read for any fan of Nietzsche's works."

Having read just four of his greater works once, I'm now doubly motivated to reread them again with the backdrop of Prideaux's lucid and lively biography of one of the most troubled - and potentially troubling - minds of the last 200 years.It's a really tragic tale. The creator of the Übermensch was striving for greatness, and that which made him 'merely' mensch - that which we can all relate to through his unrequited love, his longing for recognition, his misunderstanding from his family - was what kept him striving, until that taste of recognition, the height of his powers, quickly descended into megalomania, self-apotheosis, and madness. The human behind the man (human, all too human) has never been so wonderfully and - at least it feels - honestly portrayed as it has in Prideaux's work. Even with just a passing interest in philosophy, if you have an interest in everything human, this is a must read."

This book also conclusively (for me) rejects all Nazi claims to Nietzsche’s philosophy or beliefs. Let me just say that his sister, Elizabeth, was the Nazi and anti-Semite who took control of her brother’s papers and allowed his archives to be used with impunity by the Third Reich. And that’s actually why I wanted to read this—I was curious why I enjoyed Nietzsche’s aphorisms so much whenever I came across them—wasn’t this guy a Nazi? Ha! It turns out, no, he was against everything Nazism stands for and warned that his ideas could be easily twisted for bad ends. If anyone wants to suggest a book with an opposite view of Nietzsche I would be interested. I enjoyed this, despite its occasionally awkward writing. In the most important passages, the author writes clearly and cogently."
148,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15964675-krn,Rating 5 out of 5,"Prideaux is very deft at the edges. Her eye picks out seemingly superfluous detail - who was Strindberg staying with before writing Miss Julie? - and weaves it into the compelling narrative of Nietzsche's turbulent life. Having successfully written biographies of Strindberg and Munch, she comes to Nietzsche fully prepped, as it were.Is she any good at philosophical exegesis, though? I feel this isn't really an appropriate question. Lots of commentaries out there on Nietzsche's philosophy. If that's what the reader is after, then Prideaux isn't the place to start. That being said, she's good enough (and has plenty of sense to gather a solid team around her).Where she excels is the support cast. Her facility with the incessant parade of people - the endless comings and goings - of even a relative recluse like Nietzsche is quite superb. It takes a village, and Prideaux's command over the time period and archival detail brings the entire village to life."
149,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5," The book is enjoyable throughout, and the last chapter is exceptional. It pushes me to try to say briefly just what, for me, it is about Nietzsche. I was first attracted by his stylistic brilliance and creativity, but they are driven by his striving to see everything he can and face everything he sees. He refuses to settle for neat conclusions. He speaks to us not as disciples but as fellow explorers: knowing that there is always more to discover and face, he wants us to think and feel our way beyond him: “Other birds will fly farther!” Thus he blows up all the philosophical and religious systems that claim to capture the fullness of life. But along with the intensity he has a sense of humor: “The gentlest, most reasonable man may, if he wears a large mustache, sit as it were in its shade and feel safe. As the accessory of a large mustache he will give the impression of being military, irascible and sometimes violent—and will be treated accordingly.”"

Si scopre poi nel pensiero del filosofo del “forse” una dimensione di matrice induista che non sapevo gli appartenesse (eterno ritorno come accettazione, ad esempio, ma non solo).Ognuno puo' trarre le proprie valutazioni sul protagonista, sui suoi familiari, sui suoi amici più o meno importanti.Di mio procedo con grandissima curiosità e con tanto dispiacere per la vita, per tutta la vita, del filosofo.

I'd read only small bits of his philosophy. A five-star book review (NYT or The Guardian) of this biography was so adulatory I was curious. Glad I checked it out. Nietzsche is elegantly placed within his time, his family, out of time, among all the Wagner big-thinking. Nietzsche's adoring Nazi sister is the reason he is associated with Hitler. She was the Nazi in the family and had control over his papers and mistranslations for years. Anyway, he was a genius and it was so exciting be led through his enthusiasms. No way to write about Nietzsche without writing about Wagner and Prideaux is blunt about him. I am interested in her biog. of Strindberg now."

She's certainly one of the best villains in a work of fiction I've read about in a long time, and she, of course, is not fictional at all! She genuinely reads like a character from the Sopranos or something similar and I ache for a novel that explores her life as Lady Macbeth of a Paraguayan colony. There is a kind of painful gift to good biographical detail that demands a novel from itself. In general, this book is excellent and probably required reading for a Nietzsche 'fan', if only because it provides essential context to his weird Wagner thing I generally ignored, being a classical music philistine. (I like the song about bees though.)"

Sue Prideux’s prose is unpretentious and direct, much like her subject’s. Coming from a position of knowing something about Nietzsche’s philosophy but nothing about his life, this book marvellously introduces me to the man’s life while refreshing and expanding my view on his ideas. I particularly enjoyed the segues into discussions of other people - notably his sister Elisabeth and her Paraguayan anti-Semitic colony - which really filled out the narrative and offered something like b-plots to the main story. Superb. Cannot recommend this book enough. "
154,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book relies on journal entries and personal letters to tell the tale of Nietzsche’s life. The author seems to stick close to the sources. Nothing feels insincere or over represented. Nietzsche never had a conventional charm but still Prideaux makes the reader relate to the philologist and philosopher through his good humor, sickness, controversy, consciousness, wit, and surprising normalcy. The biography showcases best earlier parts of Nietzsche’s life, especially his time with Richard Wagner. One of the books undercurrents is Nietzsche’s developing foundation-destroying philosophy but this is not the source for a solid understanding of his work."
155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1013182-graychin,Rating 4 out of 5,"Whoever designed the cover of Sue Prideaux’s book deserves an award. It’s a photograph of the philosopher overlaid in transparent red with an arrowslit gap (a keyhole? a capital “I”?) in the center, revealing one myopic eye and half of that incredible moustache. The black, white, and red color scheme is arresting. It’s also subtly threatening: think of the Nazi flag. Taken all together the image suggests revelation and obscurity, a declaration revolutionary but mystifying, a man half prophet and half walrus.Prideaux’s text (which did, in fact, win some awards) is well matched to the image, and to her inspired choice of title. There’s not a single dull page in this book, in my opinion.But what to make of the man himself, of Nietzsche? Personally, I have to agree with the judgment of the Russo-German femme fatale Lou Salomé, with whom Nietzsche had an intense but disappointing flirtation in the early 1880s. Prideaux writes:“[Salomé’s] interpretation of their conversations during their three weeks in Tautenburg was that, fundamentally, they spoke of nothing but God. She concluded that Nietzsche was the more religious for being godless. It was the pain of this that drove his philosophy. His entire intellectual development derived from his loss of belief and from his emotions attending the death of God. The possibility of finding some substitution for the lost God obsessed him.”It's hard to imagine a more God-haunted man that Friedrich Nietzsche. His father was a Lutheran pastor who died when Nietzche was five. He was raised by his mother, grandmother, and two maternal aunts in an environment of self-satisfied bourgeois piety. He was a bright boy, went away to school, and eventually – almost by chance – attached himself to the person and family of the composer Richard Wagner, who became a second father to him. Somewhere along the way Nietzsche discovered the hypocrisy of everyone around him. (We all do, eventually, but it troubled him more than it does most of us.) If people didn’t really live according to the principles they espoused, could they really be said to believe in the foundation of those principles? These weren’t Christians, he decided, they were “three-quarter Christians.” Suddenly, he looked around himself and knew that God was dead.Nietzsche was honest enough to admit that “you cannot keep the ethical content of Christianity without its theology” – not, that is, with intellectual consistency. Indeed, “a revolution in belief requires a revolution in morality.” He understood that “in the absence of a god, mankind will worship anything.” He saw with dismay that mankind was already half-prostrate in adoration of the golden calf of Science, not understanding that it, too, was a mere idol without power to promise meaningful deliverance. What was needed – and what Nietzsche strived mightily to realize in himself – was a novel icon of salvation, not a crucified slave but an Ubermensch ""who, despite the death of God, does not succumb to skepticism and nihilism; his freedom from belief enhances his life.""I’m simplifying things, of course, but anyhow it was not to be, at least not for Nietzsche. Instead, as the story goes, the fire breather who despised pity collapsed in tears at the sight of a flogged horse, and he never recovered. He went mad.I am a Christian but I can’t help liking Nietzsche. He was right, and insightful, about so many things. He was also an appealingly aphoristic writer, which helps. Consider, for example: “[The state] never has any use for truth as such, but only for truth which is useful to it,” or “How to ruin a youth: instruct him to hold in high esteem only those who think like him,” or “Whoever lives for the sake of combat has an interest in the enemy staying alive,” and one of my favorites, “Never trust a thought that occurs to you indoors.”Reading Prideaux's book, you feel outraged on Nietzsche’s behalf when his ideas are misappropriated by the Nazi regime, with the encouragement of his own sister Elizabeth, whose funeral Hitler attended. Nietzsche was repulsed by anti-Semitism. “I know my fate,” he once wrote. “One day there will be associated with my name the recollection of something frightful.”But it's Nietzsche’s God-hauntedness that most endears him to me. I hope I’m not simply gratified by the ultimate failure (as I judge it) of his project, though I can’t help but see a powerful-though-contradictory witness to the necessity of faith in the via negativa of his intellectual self-immolation. There’s nothing satisfying for me in his final madness, though I wonder if, by a hard providence, it shielded him from worse blasphemy. In his later years he was like a child again to his mother, and perhaps (who knows?) to God.But is Christian faith really so impossible? Did we really pass some bourne of history in the 19th century that put it out of reach to ""thinking"" people? Is God truly dead? I am by no means the smartest guy in the room, but as a Catholic I can only say that, for most of us, faith is not some kind of mystical gift or weakness of the emotions. It’s simply a choice. It is fundamentally the act of trusting – putting your “faith” in – the person of Jesus Christ, as True God and True Man. I experience Him as very much alive in the prayer, worship, and sacraments of the Church.Maybe that’s asking too much of Nietzsche and his disciples, I don't know. But a half-turn of the will, I think, and rather than an antichrist (self-proclaimed), Nietzsche might have been a saint instead."

Well written and informative if you want to understand Nietzsche, and the last 2,000 years of western civilization. He has been misunderstood and as he feared his words were misused (by the Nazis). He wanted no disciples so I am not one; he gave no answers (he wanted us to figure it out). What he gave us is the most important framework of reality to be given. Governments, religion, science, all lie and enslave us. The individual must “become what he is.” He must realize that facts are only interpretations. Read this book. Enjoy the many aphorisms."

Prideaux treats Nietzsche with compassion yet does not take all of his philosophical and personal whims too seriously. A witty, ironic portrait of the multi-faceted thinker and his tumultuous time.

اما برای ورود به جهان نیچه، برای گام برداشتن در جهان اندیشه‌های عمیق و گاه عجیب و غریب او، مثل تمام متفکرین بایست کل میراث فکری و فلسفی او را با دقتی خواند و درباره‌اش اندیشید. و شاید گام برداشتن در جهان زیسته‌ی آن متفکر، قدمی مفید در جهت ورود به جهان فکری و میراث فلسفی‌اش باشد. و سو پریدو در کتاب «من دینامیتم! سرگذشت فردریش نیچه» این مهم را با نثری زیبا و روایتی جذاب و خواندنی به تصویر می‌کشد. پریدو به زندگی مردی می‌پردازد که بعدها به جایگاه متفکری رسید که بسیاری او را فیلسوفی دانسته‌اند که حتا اگر منکر و منتقد او نیز باشید، مجبور به عبور از او با شناخت دقیق‌اش هستید. حتا اگر چون لوک فری کتابی با عنوان ""چرا نیچه‌ای نیستم"" بنویسید، مجبورید او را جدی بگیرید. نیچه غولی است که بر آستانه عصری جدید ایستاده است. عصری که انسان معاصر در آن به موجودی متفاوت تبدیل خواهد شد. موجودی دل‌زده، بی‌معنا و سرگردان. و شاید او اولین اندیشمندی بود که این‌ها را دید و چون پرسش‌ها و مساله‌های محوری به پیش کشید. نیچه درباره موجودی اندیشید و نوشت که در سرگردانی نیهیلیستی خودش مستعد گرفتار شدن در دام‌های مختلفی است. او هشدار دهنده جهانی است بدون پشتوانه‌ی همیشگی‌اش در جهت معنادادن و وزن پیدا کردن. برای همین است که اندیشه‌ی او هنوز تازه است. چرا که شاید ما در جهانی نیچه‌ای به سر می‌بریم. نیچه هنوز برای انسان معاصر حرف برای گفتن دارد. و هنوز می‌توان مسائل فردی و جمعی خود را در او جُست و یافت. پریدو در «من دینامیتم» با لحنی خودمانی و با متنی یک‌دست و جذاب، تنها به سیر وقایع زندگی این متفکر بزرگ نمی‌پردازد. با مطالعه دقیق آثارش زندگی فکری او را هم کنار واقعیت‌های روزمره‌اش پیش می‌برد. برای همین است که این کتاب از یک زندگی‌نامه کمی فراتر می‌رود یا دست‌کم زندگی‌نامه‌ای است پُر و پیمان و مستحکم. من دینامیتم تلاش موفق نویسنده‌ای است که متفکری را میان غبار قابل توجهی از بدفهمی‌ها و تصورات کلیشه‌ای به تصویر می‌کشد و می‌کوشد چهره‌ای حقیقی و تحلیلی منصفانه از او نشان بدهد. نیچه‌ی پریدو متفکری با بدنی رنجور و درونی آشفته، مردی ناکام در روابط و ناتوان در زندگی معمولی، اما نابغه‌ای به تمام معنا و متفکری بدیع است و توان شگفت‌انگیزی دارد در پیش‌بینی آینده میراث فکری خودش و جهانی که دارد متولد می‌شود: «از تقدیرم آگاه‌ام. روزی نام من با یاد و خاطره چیزی هراس‌انگیز همراه خواهد شد- با بحرانی بی‌سابقه در زمین، با ژرف‌ترین درگیری ِ وجدان، با تصمیمی برانگیخته‌شده علیه همه‌ی چیزهایی که تا آن زمان متعلق ِ باور و طلب و تقدیس بوده‌اند. من انسان نیستم، من دینامیتم.»سعید صدقی- بهمن 1400"

While I had a general understanding of the major parts of his life, this book provides many new details and portrays him as he was, faults included. I was shocked to discover how young he was when his illness and suffering began and the severity of his attacks. With this in mind, we can see the establishment of the foundation of his philosophy as Nietzsche had much to overcome simply to perform his daily necessary duties. Nietzsche frail physical body and soft-spoken, well-mannered personality gives a necessary contrast to his philosophy that many will come to find as surprising. This book reveals Nietzsche to be just as human as the readers as the ""Philosopher of the Hammer"" struggles with grudges, love, family feuds, and finding his own sense of meaning in the world. Nietzsche was a depressed and frustrated man who was both shackled and empowered by his sufferings. While they instilled with him an almost mechanical daily schedule and furious productivity, they also lead him to an early death. As Nietzsche himself realized, much of his philosophy was autobiographical. It appears that many of his insecurities are reflected onto his writings and he struggles to live by his own code. His relationship/bromance with Wagner, his life long affinity for music and sweets, and his failed attempts for marriage are some of the details that I think helped make him appear more relatable. It can quite shocking to many that a man that wrote such provocative and strong willed concepts could be so tender and sensitive. It was especially refreshing to read that Nietzsche was disgusted with anti-semitism and those who supported it. His sister's manipulation and adaption of his work into Nazi propaganda was incredibly frustrating as is most of her relationship to Nietzsche. He would have been appalled at what would become of his work and it is disheartening to know that many continue to associate him with the Nazi party and anti-semitism without knowing of his disdain for the hatred of Jewish people and of nationalism. Nietzsche was even proud of his revoking of his German citizenship and of his citizenship. Angered with the politics of the times, he even refuted his German heritage and claimed he was a polish man by birth!The final quarter of the book is intensely exciting as it follows Nietzsche at the height of his writing prime and also his descent into madness. It was both entertaining and disheartening to read about his increasingly egoist and manic behavior. It is easy to make connections between what is he had written and his mental state at the time. While I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, it was not without its flaws. While it presents a couple of his major philosophical concepts, namely; self-overcoming, eternal reoccurrence, and master/slave morality, I felt as if it failed to provide information on how Nietzsche developed those ideas and connect them throughout his life. The author often recorded that he simply completed certain tasks without developing how and why. For example, Nietzsche growing disbelief in Christian faith is mentioned early in his teenage years and not again until it was simply stated he was atheistic. At times it felt like the writing contradicted and failed to clarify itself, was Nietzsche misogynistic or was he kind and tenderhearted to women in particular? It is not made very clear and an argument for both sides is made without any final clarification. Perhaps these details were never recorded, but I was left wanting more in between to make connections and final statements on many of his big attributes and ideas. In addition, I felt like the book should have been extended with another final chapter that expanded upon Nietzsche's legacy post Nazi-Germany. I would have loved to learn about Nietzsche's resurgence following Walter Kaufmann's translations or how Nietzsche's true works were revealed and separated from Elisabeth's appropriation. "
198,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"It was all I knew, of Friedrich Nietzsche, ( note - I do not claim it for exemplary knowledge ) I had heard a bit of gossip, mutterings , he had gone mad, he danced naked and frenzied in his room he howled like an animal, he took to signing himself the Antichrist, he was imperious and grandiose in his madness, one was invited to a singular though benign regard from a very high being accepting with munificence the pieties and grateful obeisance of worshippers. Was not the brain a little mouse trembling and fearful under his awful gaze, had he not taken an anvil to the casing the very membrane of it and rendered it naked sullen and shaky in the noonday heat? Why would I want to read a madman, I would tremble in my boots.Otherwise I just had seen pictures of him, a huge head, a forehead that loomed like a cliff over puppy dog eyes and a moustache that really walked and talked all by itself. I had never read anything by him, from those who regarded him I understood he was weighty. Of a light hearted disposition myself I feared he’d give me a headache, I'd heard of his aphorisms, I had an impression that weighting these in my head would be like squeezing great boulders with a nutcracker. I had a feeling it would put all my lights out. In short I felt myself unequal to Nietzsche and couldn't and cannot still pronounce his surname . Friedrich I can say that. Though Fred would be better for me.Yet here I was with a book called ‘ I am Dynamite’ which is the life of Nietzsche. My eyes had lit upon it for the title. Was this a story of somebody who had devastated a continent with the sheer impact of a volatile and deadly disposition? Was it a story of a bomber? Who anyway described themselves a dynamite? Surely only one who described himself that way could not go among the the quiet diners in a civilised eating establishment . With that disposition hurling himself onto the streets practically sparking with explosive intensity, would he long be at liberty?Anyway that whats the title would lead me into the pages of the life of Nietzsche.Sue Prideaux is the author, and her handling of the materials dynamite and all is very deft, she separates his works from the vine like grip of his sister Elisabeth who (quote) ‘ betrayed him by manipulating his texts and putting them to infinite misuse at the hands of the Nazis’. (End quote).She rescues the work from taint and restores him immutable and grand to the world.The chapters are like a series of slides, of consummate scholarship, of frosted or tinted photographs , moments caught in time, you feel Sue Prideaux could give you the entire history of the world in a few nice aphorisms herself. That under the flying sheets of the life of her Nietzsche is a writer of serious muscle who can easily dig deep into enormous subjects , heavy with importance, bursting with porcupine prickles and emerge from the contest, idefeasible with a few well chosen words to describe it all and make us feel it was really light workThat no mausoleum, no quiet or unquiet vault of the dead, could withstand her . She’s impervious. resolute. brave. You feel she is equal to anything can slaughter any monster and give us the thing rendered solid, polished and shining bright , in her pages. Nietzsche in the hands of Sue Prideaux, beams out at us."
199,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12834613-unsympathizer,No Rating,"How does one review a chronology of someone else's life? A person can't be entertaining full time, and there are bound to be lulls in one's life story. Such as the case and I Am Dynamite!, which is a faithful and detailed account of Nietzsche's life. The book starts not with his birth, but when he meets the famous composer Richard Wagner for the first time, who would be one of the book's key characters. Wagner was famed for his Ring cycle, and the book's ending also has a bit of Wagner tying the cycle together.After an uneventful early life, Nietzsche strikes it big by meeting Wagner and his wife Cosima. He ends up becoming friends with the family although he would later fall out with them over Wagner revealing an embarrassing secret. He also becomes good friends with Franz Overbeck, a theology professor who handled a lot of his works. Later on he becomes friends and almost lovers with Lou Salome, a femme fatale that breaks his heart after being in a sort of love triangle with another friend Paul Ree, whose aphoristic writings influence Nietzsche's own work.Throughout the book, Prideaux examines the time, setting, and state of mind he was in during each of his major works. It is very clear to read the progression and development of his works, especially because she dispels some myths around his life. One of them was the idea that he got syphilis, when in reality it was probably gonorrhea. Silly distinction, yet one that had to be made.The more major debunking Prideaux does was the use of his work by the Nazis. She shows that it was not him but his sister Elisabeth who used his work for her anti-Semitic purposes. In real life he opposed German nationalism, to the point where he renounced citizenship to any country, calling himself just a European. He also was friends with Paul Ree, who was Jewish, as well as Georg Brandes, who promoted Nietzsche's work throughout Europe. It was only after Nietzsche went mad that his sister took over his work and used it to spread falsehoods, which led to Nietzsche's reputation post-WWII to be tarnished until Walter Kaufmann rescued his true meanings in the 1960s.With all that aside, Prideaux allows us to see Nietzsche for who he truly was: a visionary that sought to challenge all the ideas of his day, someone who did not believe in objective truth and correctly predicted that the lack of belief in any religion, plus the boringness of rational science, would lead to widespread discontent and crisis all over the now-secular world. Even in the 21st century, throughout the West, we can see Nietzsche's predictions everywhere, as people desperately search for meaning and try to ""find themselves"", whatever that is supposed to mean. Looking back at his works and concepts: Apollonian/Dionysian, master-slave morality, Zarathustra and the eternal reoccurrence, amor fati, the death of God, and so on, one can find many uses of his work today. He liked to think of himself not as mere man but as someone who came to destroy all previous conceptions. Hence, he is dynamite. "
200,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50820452-dweezil-e,Rating 3 out of 5,"In de nieuwe Nietzsche-biografie is het Elisabeth Nietzsche die naar voren treedt als de belichaming van ""Der Wille zur Macht"", een sleutelbegrip in het werk van haar broer. Er staat een foto van haar in de biografie: Elisabeth als zeventienjarig meisje, een frêle kind dat verzuipt in een veel te weidse jurk. Het is haar blik die je vasthoudt. Vastberaden, onverzettelijk, ""geen spoor van twijfel"" zoals de auteur noteert. De geschiedenis heeft hard geoordeeld over Elisabeth. Veel harder dan bijvoorbeeld over Heidegger, die toch ook graag lintjes ging doorknippen in met hakenkruizen behangen ruimtes. Ze was een rabiaat antisemiet en daar is geen vergoelijking over mogelijk. Maar hoe was haar antisemitisme anders dan dat van Heidegger of dat van de Wagners? Elisabeth groeide op in een tijd en een plaats waar onderwijs voor meisjes niet veel om het lijf had. Vrouwen werden opgevoed tot ""sieraad van het huis"", ze deden het huishouden, hielden theekransjes, gaven bijbelles op de zondagsschool en deden aan liefdadigheid. Haar lotsbestemming leek lang vast te liggen: ze zou eindigen als een oude vrijster, of zoals de auteur schrijft: “Een saaie toekomst waarin ze zorgde voor haar bejaarde moeder lag in het verschiet.” Elisabeth greep elke kans om aan dit lot te ontsnappen. Ze trok naar Bazel om voor haar broer te zorgen toen die ziekelijk werd of ging in Wahnfried wonen om voor de kinderen van de Wagners te zorgen. Zusje van spijkerde keihard aan haar eigen weg, ze had daarbij niet veel manoeuvreerruimte: het was altijd als verzorger of babysitter. Of als bruid. Ze presenteerde zich aan de megalomaan Bernhard Förster en hielp hem bij zijn plannen om een nieuwe, raszuivere kolonie in Paraguay te stichten. Een project dat op veel fronten gedoemd was te mislukken, en dat zal eindigen met de zelfmoord van Förster. Na de geestelijke instorting van haar broer eigent Elisabeth zijn werk toe. De auteur schrijft dat Elisabeth de begripsbeving nooit heeft begrepen die aan de basis lag van het denken van haar broer. Het is duidelijk dat ze zijn werk censureerde en herwerkte zodat het meer in haar kraam paste. Ze misbruikte zijn werk zodat het paste in het raamwerk van de heersende moraal. Waarom deed ze dit? Begreep ze zijn werk niet of wilde ze enkel haar eigen ster doen rijzen? De auteur schrijft meermaals dat Elisabeth een slim en intelligent meisje was. Het is helaas nooit tot wasdom kunnen komen door het verstikkende kleinburgerlijke milieu waarin ze opgroeide. Elisabeth had een ijzeren wil en overlijdt op hoge leeftijd. Tijdens haar leven werd ze vier keer genomineerd voor de Nobelprijs voor Literatuur en ontvangt ze een eredoctoraat aan de Universiteit van Jena. Zij kreeg alle maatschappelijke lof die haar broer tijdens zijn leven heeft moeten ontberen."
201,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120281935-hayden-berg,Rating 4 out of 5,"I tend to agree with some version of the 'death of the author' concept in literature studies, which suggests that the author themself isn't as important as the ideas they write. I think the author is entitled to a perspective or interpretation of their work, but that interpretation doesn't need to be the 'right' one by any means. Publishing a work and sharing it with others means that they will read it and make it their own. I think Nietzsche believed something like this as well (after all he never wanted followers). That being said, I think history and biography can inform us about significant cultural or social pressures which may have influenced works and these insights can be valuable. I didn't realize the intensity of Nietzsche's illness or his madness prior to reading this. He frequently talks about illness and convalescence in his writing, but I didn't realize this came from a person who suffered from chronic illnesses all his life. I have also heard that Nietszche went mad in his later life, but the degree of his madness was never spelled out quite so clearly as it is here. I was very interested in Nietzsche's relationship with Wagner (and their mutual love for Schopenhauer) and how it really impacted his early thought. The details of their break from each other were also fascinating. I'd always assumed that Nietzsche parted ways with Wagner as the latter became more invested in antisemitic rhetoric, which Nietzsche detested. While this still seems true, I found it very funny that the break between the thinkers can be traced back to Wagner spreading rumors about Nietzsche's masturbation habits as a cause for his sickness. Generally speaking, I loved learning more about Nietzsche's life. I found that instead of a biography that held Nietzsche up as this 'great person' whose life and individual achievements ought to be recognized and praised, this book presents Nietzsche as a human being. He's sick, he's lonely, he's heartbroken, he's mad -- he's just a person! I think a good Nietzsche biography should aim to do just this -- demystify the man behind the historical figure and show us that, while his work is significant and beautiful, he's not an infallible leader who aspired to greatness and never pretended to be one. Furthermore, this should be the last nail in the 'Nietzsche was a nazi' coffin. He very clearly spent so much of his life publicly mocking antisemites and talking about their beliefs as life-denying, nihilistic, and a product of cultural decay. Anti-semitism seems to inherently un-Nietzschean.Anyway, I'm rambling a bit, but the book was well-written and well-researched. It doesn't go into too much depth about his philosophical beliefs, but when it does it seems on point with what I understand his work to be saying. It's very good and I learned a lot!"

Gelesen habe ich ihn dann tatsächlich nie und die Bücher meiner Oma sind längst Makulatur.Später habe ich Nietzsche nur noch mit Schlagworten wie ""Wille zur Macht"", ""Übermensch"" und ""Herren-Moral"" in Verbindung gebracht und in ihm einen Vordenker und Wegbereiter der nationalsozialistischen Ideologie gesehen. Einer, der in den Giftschrank der Geschichte gehört und am besten nie mehr wieder herausgeholt werden sollte.Das wäre wohl auch so geblieben, hätte ich den Buch der britisch-norwegischen Autorin Sue Prideaux nicht eine Chance gegeben, Auf gut 500 Seiten schildert Prideaux das Leben und Denken Nietzsches: Genauestens recherchiert, in einer präzisen und doch einfühlsamen Sprache. Ein Leben, das in zwei Hinsichten tragisch war. Zum einen war Nietzsche ein geplagter Mensch - sein Kindheit quälten ihn alle möglichen gesundheitlichen Beschwerden, Glück in der Liebe hatte er nie und sein beruflicher Erfolg und Ruhm als Autor hielt sich zu seinen Lebzeiten sehr in Grenzen. Seine letzten Lebensjahre waren von Krankheit und völligem geistigen Verfall gekennzeichnet. Tragisch ist auch der Mißbrauch seiner Gedanken. Wie Prideaux zeigt, ging es Nietzsche in erster Linie darum, das Denken von den Fesseln der Religion zu befreien und den Weg zu einem selbstverantwortlichen und und freiem Denken zu ebnen. Sein Nachlass wurde von seiner Schwester Elisabeth manipuliert und vor allem aus Geltungsdrang gezielt für die Zwecke der aufkommenden nationalsozialistischen Idee eingesetzt.Es gelingt der Autorin, sehr überzeugend darzulegen, wie furchtbar Unrecht man Nietzsche damit getan hat.Hochinteressant sind auch die Verbindungen Nietzsches zu berühmten Zeitgenossen, insbesondere sein erst freundliches Verhältnis zu Richard und Cosima Wagner, das später sehr abkühlen sollte. Prideaux gelingt es, ein ganzes Kapitel deutscher und europäischer Geistesgeschichte lebendig werden zu lassenFür mich war die Lektüre des Buches, als hätte sich ein Fenster geöffnet in eine Zeit, vor der ich so gut wie nichts wusste. Es wird deutlich, wie die NS-Ideologie Ideen und Gedanken aufgreifen und umformen konnte, die mehr als eine Generation zurück reichten und wie diese in pervertierter Form einverleibt wurden in das vernichtende größenwahnsinnige Weltbild der Nazis. Ich kann der Autorin nur dafür danken, dass ich die Geschichte meines eigenen Landes nun ein Gutteil besser verstehe."

Τον Φεβρουάριο 2021, ο Χάρης Βλαβιανός επιμελήθηκε την εν λόγω βιογραφία στα ελληνικά για λογαριασμό των Εκδόσεων Πατάκη.Ο Friedrich Nietzsche λοιπόν γεννιέται το 1844 από βαθιά θρησκευόμενους γονείς. Μια ιδιαίτερη ιδιοφυία στα φιλολογικά και την φιλοσοφία, από νωρίς κατέκτησε την θέση του καθηγητή φιλοσοφίας στο Πανεπιστήμιο της Βασιλείας. Διακατείχε θετικά συναισθήματα για τον μουσικοσυνθέτη Βάγκνερ και την συζυγό του Κοζίμα. Αν και το πρώτο του βιβλίο, Η Γέννηση της τραγωδίας πήρε καλές κριτικές και τον καθιέρωσε ως φιλοσοφικό πνεύμα της εποχής εντούτοις η σωματική του υγεία (έντονοι πονοκεφάλοι, αιματοπτύσεις και μ��ιωμένη όραση) δεν του επέτρεψε να ζήσει φυσιολογικά αλλά παρολαυτά δεν επηρέασε το πνεύμα του και την κριτική του σκέψη. Το 1882 γνωρίζεται με την Λου Σαλομέ, την οποία ερωτεύεται παράφορα. Εκείνη από την πλευρά της δείχνει ενδιαφέρον για τον Νίτσε αλλά απελευθερωμένη όπως είναι δεν θέλει να τον παντρευτεί και αποφασίζει να συζήσει μαζί του και με τον Πάουλ Ρέε, σχηματίζοντας ένα ερωτικό τρίγωνο.Από το βιβλίο δεν λείπουν επίσης οι αναφορές στην πίστη του Νίτσε αφού πολλές φορές ο ίδιος προβληματίστηκε με τον θεό και αυτό φαίνεται και στα φιλοσοφικά του έργα.Τα τελευταία χρόνια της ζωής του, τα έζησε απομονωμένος από τον υπόλοιπο κόσμο όμως αυτό δεν τον επηρέασε. Το 1892 τα βιβλία του Ανθρώπινο πάρα πολύ ανθρώπινο, Η Γενεαλογία της Ηθικής και Ο Ζαρατούστρας απέκτησαν μεγάλη δημοτικότητα και διαβάστηκαν με θετικές κριτικές στην Δυτική και Βόρεια Ευρώπη.Παρόλο που ο Νίτσε άρχισε να αναγνωρίζεται ως φιλόσοφος, η υγεία του σωματική και ψυχολογική παρέμεινε κλονισμένη, με αποτέλεσμα να αποσυρθεί από τον κόσμο σε τραγική κατάσταση και χαώδες μυαλό. Την φροντίδα του την ανέλαβε η αδερφή του Ελίζαμπετ, η οποία μετά τον θάνατο του αδερφού της το 1900, κράτησε αρχείο με τα συγγράμματα του τα οποία η ίδια διαστρέβλωσε για δικό της όφελος. Το 1932 όταν ο Αδόλφος Χίτλερ ανέλαβε την εξουσία της Γερμανίας, η Ελιζάμπετ ως αντισημίτρια μετατράπηκε σε έμπιστη του Χίτλερ. Χρησιμοποίησε τα συγγράμματα του Νίτσε ως ευνοικά απέναντι στους Ναζί και στον φασισμό. Δυστυχώς η Ελιζάμπετ η οποία πίστευε ότι ήταν το πιο αγαπημένο άτομο του Νίτσε δεν σεβάστηκε τον αδερφό της και η μνήμη του αμαυρώθηκε εκείνη την περίοδο με αυτόν τον τρόπο."

My two favourite quotes: ‘One needs chaos in ones soul to give birth to a dancing star’.‘The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened.But no price is too high for the privilege of owning yourself’."
205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108617840-alexa-tanne,Rating 5 out of 5,"I'm giving this five stars as it was immensely enjoyable to read. I had read Nietzsche before as an undergraduate student, but then put his work down for some years - this was the perfect way back in to his life and thought. Even though I am loosely familiar with this philosophy, I had no knowledge of his biography and, as it turns out, it makes a true page-turner. Prideaux offers a concise and clear image of the cultural and intellectual context of Nietzsche's work, stemming from the dominance of Schopenhauer's philosophy right up to the rise of Hitler and German Nationalism. This not only gives a good historical backdrop, but crucially emphasises how different and important Nietzsche's thinking was in his own time - something for which he was not recognised until his very final years. N's life is given a light-hearted and sometimes downright comical spin in this biography. For all his hard-headed seriousness and prophetic foresight, the reader will find Nietzsche to be something quite different as he acquires pink silk underpants for Wagner, among other things. Another revealing aspect of this biography for me was that Nietzsche is shown to be a very independent philosopher - indeed not really a philosopher at all in the traditional understanding. His way of thinking and writing was inspired just as much by long walks in the mountains and solitary meditations as it was by reading 'actual' philosophy, which he seems to have done less of in comparison. For anyone looking for a more intellectual, philosophy-focused introduction to Nietzsche, try Kaufmann's 'Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist', which is very different to this book. I'm not saying that Prideaux's book is inferior, just that it offers something to a broad and general audience rather than a more specialised academic one. Neverthless, I am sure that even readers with a passing interest in philosophy will manage to form a reading list out of the bibliography that 'I am Dynamite' provides.All in all, great fun to read, highly revealing, and at times very inspiring. As i'm not a biographer of Nietzsche, and have only read Kaufmann's book to compare it with, it is hard for me to say how accurate/exagerrated the accounts in the book are. Hyperbole or not, it would be very hard not to enjoy reading 'I am Dynamite'. "
206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1971718-b-rule,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is more of a personal biography than an intellectual one. Of course, with thinkers like Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, the personal often is the philosophical, so this approach is arguably not wrong. Prideaux ably wields the whip to force a march through Nietzsche's life, and things move at a rapid clip even when it might make sense to slow down. She won't let complicated ideas distract her from her goal, and Nietzsche's thought gets sketched in only enough detail to make him intelligible as the subject of the biography. I did appreciate Prideaux's no-nonsense approach in dismissing some of the mythology and received wisdom about Nietzsche: she has no patience for his sister Elizabeth and his Nazification at her hands, she destroys any residual sense that he might have countenanced anti-semitism, militarism, or nationalism in his name, and she throws cold water on the diagnosis of syphilis. What's left is a portrait that's more pathetic than tragic: her subject was luckless in love and in health, largely ignored during his lifetime, florid in his writing while meek in person, and often dependent on the kindness of his rightfully exasperated friends for whatever small luck floated his way. Even controlling for the histrionic emotional standards of his age, I can tell I'd much rather read him than meet him. Despite not diving deeply into his texts, Prideaux has given us an accurate portrait of the man, and her summary of his posthumous reception is revealing if depressing. This is a decent biography but doesn't rise to the heights of the finest of the genre. Frankly, it should have been funnier, given her subject. Nietzsche himself is often darkly hilarious, but only faint glimmers of that shine through here. Prideaux would have written a better book if she allowed herself to have a little more fun. Nietzsche often cuts a ridiculous figure (and whether he's self-aware about it is the truly fascinating question), so a few droll asides or authorial rolls of the eyes would be welcomed."
207,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/142773995-tobi-rath,Rating 5 out of 5,"Take some time to enter his world. Ms. Prideaux invites you to join her journey through his life. I think it's worth being read but be careful not to spend too little time for the lecture. The statements developped chapter by chapter need some attention. I didn't agree with everything being reported to be said by the person of Friedrich Nietzsche. But fortunately, Prideaux offers you the historical background necessary for this aim. Contemporary issues as antisemitism and nationalism took apparently much space in Nietzsche’s life as the constraints of his epoch did as their own. Prideaux focusses on his vita activa, the timespan of about some 20 years of working, even less I admit. This focus is justified by the interest in his philosophical or moral approach in addressing himself to the human cosmos. I say this because of Nietzsche's omnipresent proximity to ancient Greek thinking. There are many occasions offered in this biography to reflect on some fundamental questions of the nature of mankind, not by his origin, but by his contemporary role and responsibility to human nature. It's for that reasoning that one puts N. among philosophers and especially him to the threshold of a modern approach towards philosophy. According to Prideaux, you have to name N. the philosopher of the ""may be"", as he rejects all positivism and established religious beliefs (christian church). If my judgement seems some kind of confusing, it's all due to the course of N.'s life. Interesting are the last chapters concerning his last decade of life being severely brain sick and then those part narrating his bequest having his doubtful sister managing it. It's been primarily up to her that N. was going to be exploited by the upcoming nazi movement. I gave five stars to this well researched book because it accompanied plenty of coffees taken in my spare time while allowing some exit of daily concerns and discovering some hidden interesting facts about this great man of modern thinking. Honestly, Nietzsche's always been a deplorable man... why? discover by yourself!"

A biografia é uma aventura pelos confins reais e oníricos da Mãe Alemanha de Nietzsche, da qual ele viria se afastar cada vez mais durante a vida. Desde a moral dominante da vila de nascença até o profundo desconforto em se identificar alemão, Prideaux ilustra a jornada trilhada pelo pequeno pródigo acometido por crises de saúde, que se tornou o andarilho pobre e escritor prolixo que financiava a publicação de seus próprios livros, convencido que se tornariam celébres somente após sua morte. Infelizmente, estava certo.A autora destrincha com cuidado suas principais influências, suas músicas, peças, poetas, matérias e filósofos favoritos a ponto de eu me sentir confortável em chamar nietzsche de meu amigo porque reconheci o seu âmago solitário que clama por elevação, superação de si mesmo através do enfrentamento da morte de Deus. ""O homem é um erro de Deus, ou Deus é o erro do homem?"" Friedrich indaga, indaga, indaga com sua excessiva sutileza a berros. Eu vejo com meus dois olhinhos, uma vontade absurda de despir sua própria moral cristã (que durante a sua infãncia foi o alicerce de seu ser), indignação por seus contemporâneos endorssando em mentiras tradicionalistas e inabalável fé na difusão do pensamento afirmador da vida e do eu, livre de cadeias criadas por filósofos e padres. Fiel a sus posição anti-sistema, Nietzsche foi cuidadoso em não elaborar qualquer tipo de receita específica. Ele disse ""Torne-se quem você é, vai lá, não importa se você não sabe o que isso é..."" e foi o suficiente para abalar o mundo.Em suma, nietzsche, como o resto de nós mortais, buscava uma filosofia que não lhe fizesse querer meter uma bala na cabeça que doía dias por vez ou em seu coração partido. Encontrou na música, montanhas suíças e em longas caminhadas o trabalho de sua vida, e enlouqueceu. Se Nietzsche não coube em si mesmo, será que caberá em um de nós? - talvez... "
209,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18808584-jonny-thomson,Rating 4 out of 5,"What fascinated me most from this book, and from what I know about philosophy and Nietzsche's thoughts, was the huge disconnect between him as a man and what he wrote. The stereotype one imagines is of a heartless and ruthless 'ubermensch' who sees pity as the supreme human vice. Yet this was a man who was part of the Swiss Medical Corps, who was loyal to the point to servile to his friend Wagner, who was dutiful and loving to his mother and sister (the latter who didn't always deserve it) and one who cared immensely what others thought. I loved how the book gave a real figure of the man - tormented, yes, but also lonely and wracked by horrendous medical ailments that would make the best of us today recoil to even think of it. He was an enduring and highly cerebral man, and Prideaux does a great job of getting this all across. I came away, too, with far greater appreciation of how varied his thoughts were - almost each of his books has a different flavour (often depending on who are the VIPs in his life at the time) up until Beyond Good and Evil when he seems to have found himself. There is a tragedy about his life which is rather sad (the final chapters on his breakdown and insanity I found heartbreaking!), but he also benefited from great friends and the humanity from those who met him. The only reason I dropped a star was that I would have liked a bit more about his actual thoughts and his books. I'm aware that Prideaux isn't a philosopher, and there are large passages devoted to his thoughts, but it would be nice to get more of a feel for the actual arguments and the philosophical conversations he would have had. Also, I felt at times that the narrative drifted too tangentially into the lives of relatively minor figures who appeared only for a brief scene or two. The editing of this might have made it flow better.Overall, an incredible immersion into the life of one of the most fascinating humans to live. It's made me want to read him all the more."

Žmogus, kuris buvo labai kosmopolitinių pažiūrų ir kas yra aiškiai pastebima kiekvienoje jo knygoje, buvo paverstas nacių ideologu. Taip jau nutinka, kad po autorių mirties jų mintys ir darbai dažnai būna iškraipomi. Šiuo atveju tai itin pastebima. Nietsche's sesuo, bemokslė antisemitė Elisabeth, kuri kartu su vyru Bernhardu Försteriu Paragvajuje įkūrė tikrų ""arijų"" koloniją, norėjo kad ir jos brolis būtų pavaizduotas pagal jos viziją. Nietzsche'i dar esant gyvam Elisabeth'ės sukurtame Nietzsche's archyve rinkosi rinktinė antisemitinė publika, nors pačio Nietzsche's raštus geriausiai išplatino žydų kilmės Georgas Brandesas.Iki išprotėjimo Nietzsche buvo iš esmės nežinomas. Jo knygų iš esmės niekas nepirko. Niekam nerūpėjo jokie vertybių perkainojimai, jokie Zaratustros. Nietsche'i mirus, jo knygos buvo perleidžiamos dideliais tiražais, o jo mintys padarė didelę įtaką visam Europos intelektualiniam elitui(P. 356).Tiems, kas visiškai nesidomėjo Nietzsche's gyvenimu, ši knyga turėtų patikti. Visų svarbiausia, kad ji paneigs tam tikrus vis dar egzistuojančius mintus. Kadangi aš buvau perskaitęs ne vieną Nietzsche's knygą, ši knyga man pasirodė pernelyg supaprastinta. Joje pasigedau didesnio skirtingų šaltinių skaičiaus. Iš esmės joje daugiausiai remiamasi laiškais ir ne visada aišku, kada baigiasi laiškas, o kada prasideda autorės teorizavimas.Jeigu norite sužinoti, kas yra paslėpta Nietzsche's knygose, net nevarkite. Čia viskas pernelyg supaprastinta. Tačiau jeigu norite sužinoti, su kokiais žmonėmis bendravo Nietzche ir kaip tai atsispindi jo kūryboje(ypač ""Zaratustroje""), tada mėginkite. Apie Nietzsche'ę yra parašyta daugybė knygų ir tikrai nemanau, kad ši yra bent kažkur per vidurį.Geriausia yra pačiam pradėti skaityti autoriaus knygas ir pamatyti, kiek daug autorė neišanalizuoja ir nepasako.

(Truth be told, the awkwardness did not merely come from Nietzsche; the maestro and his plaything did not understand well how to “deal with people.”) But when Nietzsche divests himself of Wagner and obsessively plunges into his mature works, the heartbeat goes flat.There’s a reason, one easy to feel sympathy for: Nietzsche spent a great deal of his life obsessively alone, climbing hills, walking five hours a day, composing in his head. In lieu of a well written memoir he leaves us with a stack of Unabomberish notebooks, scribbles chasing around the page in a loony labyrinth.Which brings us to the other matter in this book: health-crazed, blond-beast-worshiping Nietzsche was really, in point of fact, horrifically sick almost every day of his life. At the end, Nietzsche, generally diagnosed as having the paralytic symptoms of syphilis, appears to have the physical and vocal demeanor of every schizophrenic you’ve ever encountered on a subway car. In brief, Nietzsche, supremely the theorist of “the body” avant la lettre, hater of the “sickness” of Christianity and mercy and resentment of success and strength, was supremely sick. He hid it, the opposite of those Twitter warriors who try to turn every “mental illness” into a medal of moral superiority. He was, in fact, the literal opposite of those people, so much so that in many ways he mirrored them. Nietzsche and the sick body: about this, one hopes, more later."
212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13769366-hal,Rating 3 out of 5,"Philosophy and its power, or perceived power to shape thought and action has always been somewhat a mystery to me. This biography on Nietzsche reinforced this for me.The author presents a most scholarly and well written book on this man. It certainly wasn't easy or entertaining a read but deep in interpretation and presentation of this enigmatic yet oddly powerful man. Nietzsche has been misrepresented sometimes grotesquely through the years, particularly by the Nazi's who took him as one of their standard bearers. The author convincingly dynamites this concept and lays the distortion rightly so at the feet of his meddling and mendacious sister.The book can be plodding at times as his mostly dreary existence makes for likewise reading. Yet we also gain interesting takes on his tangled relationships with primarily the Wagner's and Lou Salome. This human interaction is in stark contrast to his often solitary wandering nature.Nietzsche's philosophy is of course touched on but not in great depth as there are so many works devoted to such. This is after all a biography tuned to the twists and turns of his mostly tortured life.It gives us a fairly complete historical and cultural look into partly what moved the man and his thought, his relations, and his tragic ending.It is once again shown that like many such geniuses, if he could be termed that, little recognition is shown during active lifetime. Those final years being a shell of a man in an empty mind and body, he is then elevated to genius status by those who flocked to interpret him and run with the concepts and ideas to their own ends. "
213,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Nietzsche was not a Nazi. He would have been opposed to the philosophy; it was his sister who was a devotee of Hitler, and she twisted his writings to make him appear to be one also. As the author of this book puts it, ""she was the spider at the center of the Nietzsche archive, weaving her brother's words into her own web [and] presenting her brother as the mystic prophet of her own convictions."" Those of us who actually have read what he wrote need to keep stressing the evil that has been done to his work. This book will help: it is well written...the author is a novelist as well as a biographer.Nietzsche was handicapped by poor vision for a great part of his life and eventually went insane. This appears to have been a consequence of an infection with syphilis, which was not treatable when he was alive. As he apparently lived a largely celibate life, this is ironic.He lived in a villa with a magnificent view that abuts a forest in which a ""new landmark rises up against the trees on the horizon: the tall, smoke-blackened crematorium chimney of the Buchenwald concentration camp."" Nietzsche absolutely would not have approved, but his sister probably would have had she lived to see it.The book concludes with a list of his aphorisms, all categorized. One is particularly apt: ""Only those with very large lungs have the right to write long sentences."" His writing is largely very readable, not what one expects of a philosopher, especially a German philosopher.If you want to know something about this man, this book is the place to start."

I Am Dynamite is a fantastic read and Sue does a phenomenal job at keeping the story progressing through the difficult life of the subject. Nietzsche is remarkable! He seems equal part genius, equal parts madman. Ultimately, this book succeeded in providing what I desired from it. I now have a great understanding of Nietzsche’s life and reception to understand the context of his writings. If you have never read Nietzsche like myself, I can’t recommend this book highly enough! And if you have already started tackling his writings, I’m sure this book would provide great context for better comprehension. I leave feeling excited, sad and encouraged. Nietzsche, as it seems, never truly found a home here. I surely don’t agree with everything he said. Towards the end of his life, prior to his mental deterioration, he seems to be raving like a lunatic at the prospect of being the second messiah. But what I find in Nietzsche is the freedom to question. The desire to aspire for better. The struggle between good and bad.

It's an interesting, entertaining and amusing read, with a cast of thousands (many of whom I know well from other parts of my reading life...)But do I know all about Nietzsche now? Do I understand his 'philosophy', or anything at all about why he appeals so much to those to whom he appeals? (I think of some of the characters in Morse and Lewis's Oxford, or Alan Bennett's The History Boys, who are devoted to Nietzsche.) Are his writings profoundly anti-Christian and anti-God (as is sometimes supposed) or are they the kind of criticism of Christianity that Jesus himself might well have made? And what's this 'death of God' stuff about, anyway? Isn't that what Christians believe about the Cross?S0, no: I still don't know all about Nietzsche, and I'd be surprised if many people did. His aphoristic style is so tantalising and elusive that it looks like everyone finds confirmation of what they already believe or want to believe. Like e e cummings's lines:For whatever we lose (like a you or a me)it's always ourselves we find in the seaPoor, mad Nietzsche. Did he discover and try to share something really true and new, even if it was only a 'perhaps'...?

The prophet comes through in this biography to have been a much cuter, sweeter, and meditative vulnerable man than the badass that emerges from his writings. Having read the biography I am confident that the experience of reading the philosopher is sorely incomplete without a look at his life. And this life. He was a man who struggled to compose a single opera but was a militant lover of music and composition. A man who was sickly, weak, and shrouded in literal darkness but wrote books asking people to find ways that affirmed life (it is less ironic than it appears at first). He wrote trashy lines on the word and breath of women and took consistent steps to invite women into the public space both in University and in his own life. A man with infinite empathy for people with suffering with at times ruthless prose. Someone who denigrated Jewish morality but snapped relations with people dear to him with anti-semitic sentiments. Finally the tragedy of all - a man who firmly stood his ground against nationalism and suspected war had become even as he was alive a slow but powerful symbol of amorality, belligerence, and real politik. I wish more biographies of literary figures were written like this. Fun, gripping, and empathetic. "

I think should be.Sue Prideaux gives a brilliant and deeply emotional account of Nietzsche's life. Here you see the man who cried ""God is dead."", but you also see the man who laughed with joy, like a child, on seeing Mount Vesuvius for the first time. Here you see the visionary, but also the pain that caused him at being ignored and humiliated by the world. Here you see the the thinker who said ""You go to women? Do not forget the whip!"", but also the teacher who a lady once described as ""above all kind, natural, humorous, and very human, a person of exquisite sensitivity and tenderness."" Here you see the prophet of bold proclamations, but also the philosopher of humility.I am Dynamite got me hooked from the first page, seeing this clever boy develop into the great man the world know him as today. The journey was chaotic, punctuated by moments that made me smile ear to ear and moments that made my heart tremble with rage, and moments of well fleshed-out humanity and painful beauty. The last three chapters were particularly moving: my eyes got all watery reading them. I think they're enough reason to give Sue Prideaux all the awards in the world."

He had very short lucid and healthy interludes.I also had no idea of his relationship with Wagner and Cosima and its many phases: and admiration that became a friendship but disolved into a rivalry.Nietszche occupies an unenviable position regarding his fame: he was not one of those who is only famous post-mortem. He was still alive when he became famous, but, sadly, had already lost his sanity.I had no knowledge of the role played by Elisabeth, his controlling sister, throughout his life. A Nazi-sympathizer, she was responsible for tainting the family name, lending her ailing brother's ouvre to Hitler and, in his last days, even exhibited her brother as a circus animal.Speaking of this unfortunate link between Nietszche and Nazism, what is most ironic and sad about it is how writings and ideas from a thinker so free he took pride in contradicting himself were used to justify the reich's dogma.Lastly, it is not lost on me how Nietszche, the son of a preacher who ""killed God"", was looking for other gods for the rest of his life.

Und dann realisierte ich, dass ich in den letzten Monaten immer wieder über Nietzsche gestolpert bin. Immer wieder tauchte er in meinem Leben auf, vor allem in Buchform natürlich. So landete das Buch auf meiner Wunschliste und der Randomgenerator fand, dass ich noch nicht genug Nietzsche in meinem Leben habe. So kam ich also wieder zu Nietzsche. Oder Nietzsche zu mir.Diese Biographie ist von Prideaux sehr gut recherchiert, aktuell und akribisch. Der Schreibstil der Autorin ist zwar nicht wissenschaftlich, aber doch etwas fordernder. Deshalb empfehle ich dieses Buch vor allem Leuten, die sich wirklich auf Nietzsche und sein Leben einlassen wollen. Wer nur mal einen Überblick erhaschen möchte, wird mit einem anderen Buch wohl besser bedient sein.Wer aber einen tiefen Einblick in Nietzsche, sein Werk, die Menschen um ihn herum erhalten möchte, der bekommt hier einiges geliefert. Prideaux beschreibt nicht nur das Leben des Philosophen selbst, sondern nimmt sich auch Zeit für seine Werke und die Taten derjenigen, die Nietzsche nahestanden. So bekommt man viele Details geliefert, die zusammen ein wuchtiges Leben ausmachen.Auch wenn ich noch nicht so viel von Nietzsche selbst gelesen habe, so bin ich doch froh, mich durch dieses Werk geackert zu haben. Es war aufschlussreich, auch spannend und faszinierend. Aufschlussreich, informativ und obwohl manchmal etwas anstrengend, hat es mich immer wieder gepackt. Somit eine empfehlenswerte Biographie für alle Interessierten."
223,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is an admirable biography. Sympathetic, without being sychophantic, and clearly very well informed about the subject’s context. The focus is very much on Nietzsche’s life rather than his work (on which there is an immense secondary literature anyway). Nietzsche comes across as a brilliant but vulnerable figure. Frequently solitary and plagued through his life with debilitating and painful illness, even before his ultimate breakdown.Notwithstanding there are crucial relationships in his life each of which is dealt with at length. With the Wagners, with whom he was initially fascinated but from whom he ultimately broke, for a range of reasons including their anti-semtism. Notwithstanding their alienation he went on writing about Wagner almost until the end of his active life. With Lou Salame, who features in a notorious photograph with Nietzsche and Paul Ree, and who is depicted here as a kind of femme fatale, not above exploiting Nietzsche for her own ends. Finally there is his sister, a somewhat ridiculous figure in hindsight, but also a rather unpleasant racist, nationalist who acted as a sort of literary executor who poisoned the legacy of Nietzsche for a generation or more.Notwithstanding his vulnerability and long experience of failure and disappointment (none of his books selling more than a few hundred copies during his working life) Nietzsche comes across with a sort of grandeur through his engagement with the implications of living in a secular world. If God is dead what happens to a morally based on Judeo- Christianity? How do we learn to live anew in the modern world?"

I listened to this on the Nicolas Guy Smith narrated audiobook and loved it from start to finish.

But his professional career was hardly a success; he only gained renown after his descent into madness.Nietzsche’s career began impressively. He was appointed Chair of Classical Philology at just 24 and soon made the acquaintance of the great Richard Wagner. But the books he published fell flat, his health deteriorated, and he eventually succumbed to mental illness.Why was Nietzsche’s life so difficult? What were his books really about?And what sort of influence did he end up having on the world?You’ll learn:* how Nietzsche and Wagner bonded in beautiful Lucerne;* why Nietzsche declared the death of God; and* how his sister Elisabeth controlled his legacy into the twentieth century."

I studied Nietzsche as part of my undergrad and it had a big effect on me. I'd wondered since then whether I'd been inspired by something that was maybe actually a bit questionable or dangerous so it was good to revisit the philosophy through this book and check that out. And it's all good. His philosophy was as I remembered: 'revolutionary opposition to certainty that led him to describe himself as the philosopher of ""perhaps"" ... a practical joker ... who would rather be seen as a buffoon than a saint... the idea that truth had no single definition but might fruitfully be examined as a question of perspectives... there existed no eternal reason-spider but merely accidents on the dance floor of life, and that existence was no less meaningful for that... to find value and meaning in an uncertain universe in which neither the ideal nor the divine existed.'Fascinating to learn also about this period of history and how his work was used by terrible people."

I particularly remember laughing at the anecdote where Wagner imitated a raging bull (even bellowing like one) in order to vent his frustration at the dress maker for not living up to Wagner's perfectionist standards. Sue also gives some historical and intellectual context to the reader so you can understand the manifold influences on the dynamic evolution of Nietzsche the man rather than philosopher and why Nietzsche resonated so strongly with the culture after him. I say the man rather than the philosopher because it is light on philosophical interpretation of his work, which might bore some people but for a general reader like me I didn't feel that it detracted from this captivating biography.

228,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3104186-roz,Rating 4 out of 5,"A good biography, both scholarly (lots and lots of footnotes, a detailed bibliography and more!) but without the technical jargon or painstaking detail one expects from those kinds of books. It covers Nietzsche’s life and thought as it evolved over the years, blossoming in a remarkably short period of time before his decent into madness. Especially noteworthy is Prideaux’s treatment of Nietzsche’s sister Elisabeth, who was a mixture of hate (anti-semitism in particular) and self promotion, who shamelessly used other people to get ahead in life. She would make for an interesting book herself. Prideaux does a good job systemizing Nietzsche’s thought, and although I wish she had spent a little time on the rehabilitation job walter kaufmann did on him, I also accept it’s a little outside the scope of a book such as this. All in all, a good place to start with Nietzsche, I think, and a good primer on his life. "
229,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've often said the worst kind of biography is when you don't realize the impact of that person, but reading Sue Prideaux's Life of Nietzsche, you feel that he was instrumental in shaping history in a gigantic, monumental way similar to, say. J.Robert Oppenheimer. And similarly to Oppenheimer, Nietzsche unwittingly gave birth to evil (instead of just tragedy) with the Nazi appropriation of his books which, far from being murk on the horizon, is a threat practically falling on his work by the time he dies with the Far-Right and Anti-Semitism being ghouls that lure away his family and closest friends, namely Wagner and Nietzsche's own sister. The contrast between Wagner and Nietzsche is the greatest part of the book, that of this man (Wagner) who was deeply talented and artistic but also evil whereas Nietzsche longed for musical artistry but also had the moral virtue and intellect that Wagner did not.

This is as between the death of his father at a young age, the chronic bad health, and the ever-threatening abyss of insanity, Nietzsche might as well have been walking around with a cosmic ""kick me"" sign stuck to his back. One might say that since conventional happiness was a low-probability reality for the man, causing trouble was the next best option.Still, the high points were quite high, particularly when the man was most closely associated with Wagner. This is at least until that relationship went off the rails, when Wagner became a virtual god to the Pan-Germanic and anti-Jewish crowd that Nietzsche loathed. That these people came to esteem Nietzsche is another cosmic bad joke that the man could see coming. Inevitably, this story is also stalked by the figure of Nietzsche's sister Elizabeth, and yes, she is quite the piece of work. One almost admires the woman for her implacable will and drive, even if she espoused a bad cause.As for whether this makes me want to read more of Nietzsche's philosophy, the answer is probably not. At the end of the day his basically anti-science attitude is alien to me, though probably the start of a critique of scientism."

Dat hing sterk samen met zijn levensloop, gekenmerkt door veelvuldige ziekte en ander ongemak. Nietzsche was van mening dat 'alle filosofie is biografie'. Gelukkig, daarom, is 'Ik ben dynamiet' een verbluffend goed gedocumenteerde biografie. Zó goed dat het lijkt of je een roman leest. Wat een meerwaarde had het dat men elkaar zo vaak brieven schreef, een dagboek bijhield. Op die manier worden zijn levensloop en daarmee verstrengelde filosofische ontwikkeling is samenhang helder gemaakt. Naast een chronologische beschrijving van zijn levensloop en van de ontwikkeling in zijn denken, kent 'Ik ben dynamiet', als derde poot, een beschrijving van de culturele ontwikkeling in zijn tijd. Dat laatste biedt nog meer houvast om Nietzsches denken beter te kunnen plaatsen. Nietzsche heeft zelf nooit een filosofisch systeem gebouwd.

Unfortunately it doesn't spend as much time on Nietzsche's thinking as it does his bizarre personality, and as a result it becomes, at times, an exercise in sensationalism. But maybe Nietzsche's fearless philosophy was a direct result of his bizarre personality, so this focus is warranted. I expect Nietzsche would consider that insulting, but then how does one separate the life of the man from his thinking? If we want to do that, we read the man directly. If we want to know about the man's life, we have this fine little writeup.

248,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Very good readable biography and intro to Nietzsche's thoughts - makes clear that his concepts of Ubermensch (Superman), etc. were not consistent with Nazisim and that he abhorred his sister's anti-Semitism. In fact, he was proud to be a bad German and a good European. Unfortunately his last 11 years or so he was mentally unstable and literally ""in his own world."" His iconoclastic attack on systematization (like Plato) and religious systems but not spirituality are fascinating. And, on elf his aphorisms - Become who you are after you discover who that is - is worth much reflection."
249,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18866304-mark-mills,Rating 5 out of 5,"I initially found this a bit hard to get into. That's not because of any weaknesses in Prideaux's writing. It's just that Nietzche and the circles he moved in were so besotted with melodrama that their company becomes rather wearing. However, over time Prideaux powerfully demonstrates how important knowing Nietzche's life is to understanding his thought, and the heartbreaking tragedy of his final years and his posthumous appropriation by the Nazis.I would have loved an epilogue about how Nietzche's legacy was recovered from its distortion."

It can be a bit ad-hominem and even gossipy at times because of the degree to which the author is focused on Nietzsche's personal life (and because she attempts to ""explain"" his philosophy by means of events therein) - but perhaps that approach is excusable when it concerns the man who wrote that all philosophy ultimately is biographical."

It's just a lot. Beautifully done for a biography, and I learned new things and reinforced things I already knew. Like that Lou, Nietzsche's ""love,"" might be one of my favorite real life historic characters, and that in part because of her he became famous for writing misogynist one liners (this is my interpretation.)I wouldn't recommend this book unless you're ready to hunker down and care a lot about Nietzsche. Neither of which applied to me."

Sue Prideaux heeft zeer diep in de bronnen gegraven om een zo volledig mogelijk portret te schetsen van deze man zijn leven dat helaas veel te kort was. Vooral mooi was aandacht voor de vrouwen in zijn leven en de overduidelijke veroordeling van antisemieten van Nietzsche zijn zijde daarmee definitief afgerekend met de mythe dat deze filosoof een voorloper van het Nazisme zou zijn geweest (quod erat demonstrandum). Een aanrader!
253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4369455-riley-peek,No Rating,"A spellbinding biography of Nietzsche, whose insightful and often open-ended postulations on morality and human nature have been misconstrued over the years and affiliated with causes and people whom the philosopher himself would likely find reprehensible. Prideaux's account of Nietzsche's life is novelesque, reading like a künstlerroman, sprawling across time and thought to capture an epic portrait replete with fascinating nemeses, allies, and muses which gesture toward Nietzsche's oeuvre as something poetic."

I'll definitely be revisiting this one in the future."
256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8671235-monica,Rating 4 out of 5,"Esta es una muy entretenida biografía de Nietzche que se enfoca más en el hombre en sí y su entorno que en tratar de explicar su filosofía. Aún así, desmitifica con suficientes elementos las posteriores conexiones tóxicas con el nazismo y las extremas derechas europeas. También dedica bastante espacio a explicarnos el contexto en el cual se desarrolló la vida de su hermana Elizabeth y cómo manipuló la herencia intelectual de Friedrich para que se acomodase a su propia ideología."

But since reading this book I feel invigorated with an enthusiasm for his philosophy like never before. What an inspirational but perfectly normal man, it just saddens me greatly how he met his end. Long live Nietzsche!"

The best introduction to Nietzsche remains Walter Kauffman's. But that's less helpful to non-scholars than this one. A solid first book on Nietzsche. I've also read other accounts of the Nietzsche/Salome relationship that tell that story differently. "

With some editing this biography would be much greater "

In opposition to his own views on pity, it’s hard not to sympathize with him - a life plagued by ill-health, professional and romantic disappointments that culminates in a breakdown that allows his awful sister to nazify his writings and legacy. This makes me want to read Prideaux’s biographies of Munch and Strindberg."
