0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2268905-chris,Rating 1 out of 5,"After enthusiastically starting this book, I gradually became annoyed, and eventually angry, as it slid on a downward slope to the end. This embarrassing work is far beneath what I would have expected from a scholar such as Harris. What a surprise it was to find details on the sexual malpractices of spiritual gurus and how to find one that matches your ""tastes,"" among other awkward and simplistic information.I had been eagerly looking forward to reading Waking Up after its publication was announced in Spring 2014. Who better than Harris, the master of rationality, to offer a companion way to look at the world to sit side-by-side with my scientific outlook—one that embraces the spiritual without the religious? Who could object to experiencing another form of beauty in one's life that doesn't contradict the observed facts of the universe? Maddeningly, his book does not deliver on this promise, as other reviewers have also noted. What it does do is present a trivial prescription, not at all original, which is easily summarized: (1) ""you"" don't exist, and (2) empty ""your"" mind of all thought.Those that have read Waking Up, should see evidence of my displeasure by noting the deliberately frequent use of ""I"" and ""me"" in this review: ""I"" being the very one who read his book and subsequently wrote this text with some passion. ""I"" am most certainly not an illusion, believe me. (You, on the other hand, are free to believe what you will concerning yourself.)Of course, in this demotion of self and mind, Harris only reiterates ancient well-known aspects of Buddhist philosophy. He does so here without adding anything new. That reduces what's left of the book to its only other theme: that of the meaning and origin of human consciousness. Again, Harris adds nothing, this time to the relevant science, which is covered in great depth in several recent authoritative books by other scientists. An excellent example is the very readable Consciousness and the Brain: Deciphering How the Brain Codes Our Thoughts, by Stanislas Dehaene. Published in 2014, it's quite comprehensive, covering many of the points in Harris's book, with more depth and authority, and going far beyond.In the final analysis, what's left? Only some surprising autobiographical material about his use of psychoactive drugs—that is, it's surprising if you are a Harris fan. Such use may be more common by others who are not necessarily public intellectuals. (I acknowledge that, like Harris, Aldous Huxley used mescaline and wrote a book about it, the classic The Doors of Perception. Huxley's is leagues ahead in spiritual depth, even if the science is somewhat dated.)What am I critical of this book? Not for the link to Buddhism, I'm not a believer, never will be; not for the drug use, I'm not a prude; not even for the amateurish advice about gurus, since at least it is momentarily (ironically?) humorous. My ultimate criticism is his failure to teach us something new. He should have given us some real tools with which to make our lives meaningful in the spiritual sense without resorting to religion. The book's promise was forfeited. Concomitant with that failure, he has damaged his image as a leader in the American culture war, whether he wants to be one or not.This book strongly deserves a 1-star. I'm struggling to maintain some intellectual respect in Harris. He's possibly now nothing to me, despite his great previous work advocating rationality over groundless faith (see The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason). Unlike him, who seems to think that an empty consciousness is man's highest mental state, I still consider human thought to be the ultimate expression of the Universe examining itself, not the true source of pain and suffering that Harris claims in this deeply weird book."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28251796-dan-harris,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is not out yet, but Sam was nice enough to let me read the galley. It's fascinating. It will surprise a lot of people to learn that this often acerbic atheist in fact has a deep history of meditation practice. In this book - which is part polemic, part memoir, part pop-science - he makes the case for a ""spirituality"" (he doesn't like the word, per se, but points out that there are sadly no other options) divorced from religion. Whether or not, you agree with his views on faith, Sam makes a compelling philosophical and scientific argument for the benefits of meditation. "
2,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"A little disappointed with this one. Harris basically defines spirituality as the quest to see the ego and the self as illusions, and while that's certainly a worthy goal, it strikes me as a somewhat narrow definition for spirituality, as I personally find spirituality to also include things such as developing a sense of love and compassion towards other people.The book is subtitled ""A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion"". In practice, the guide parts consist of a few meditation instructions, some arguments from neuroscience and philosophy on why there isn't a unified self, and a brief discussion about how psychedelics can provide useful insights to the nature of consciousness. The meditation instructions aren't bad, but there's also nothing particularly novel about them, and only a few of them are provided. The neuroscience arguments seemed weak even to someone who believed in the claim that they were trying to establish, as did the philosophy for the most part. Ken Wilber's No Boundary: Eastern and Western Approaches to Personal Growth did the philosophy much better, I feel. I'm sure that there are people who find the content in this book interesting and novel, and there were a few useful nuggets of information, but for the most part it was either stuff that I had seen before or stuff that was novel but unconvincing.And then there is the ranting and endless religion-bashing. Harris seems to use every possible excuse to attack religion and superstition. While I'm an atheist who agrees that religions have plenty of silly beliefs, I didn't get this book to read endless rants about their evils. Blah blah Christianity prevents people from correctly interpreting their meditative experiences and is generally evil blah blah blah Buddhism is better and has a lot of valuable stuff but still we shouldn't forget that it too has all kinds of silly nastiness blah blah YES I GET IT COULD WE PLEASE GET BACK TO THE TOPIC. Oh, only for a few paragraphs, then you want to get back to the ranting. Sigh."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12528364-josh,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is bound to ignite another firestorm in the skeptic community around the word ""spirituality,"" but it really shouldn't. As Harris makes clear from the outset, his interests still lie squarely within the bounds of rational inquiry. One need not entertain any spooky metaphysics in order to honestly interrogate the mind and its limits. What he does argue, however, is that consciousness is an object of study unlike any other in science - because it is both the subject of investigation and the tool we're using to investigate. A healthy portion of the book is spent fending off the attacks Harris anticipates from his less experience-hungry colleagues in the scientific community: spirituality is a term too loaded down with religious baggage, mystics and contemplatives are all on some level lying about the depth of their experiences, and the entire enterprise is ripe for fraud. Harris is quite willing to grant some ground to these objections, but having spent a serious span of his life on meditation retreats, experimenting with mind-altering drugs, and exploring the possibilities of consciousness, he insists that there really is a ""there"" there. And scientists would be well served not to dismiss it out of hand.By the final pages, Harris has made a strong case with his usual verbal flair. All of us - scientists included - should be eager to openly and honestly explore consciousness because that's all that could ever really matter. And unlike so many self-help books, Waking Up suggests that the answer doesn't rest in learning more and more about the ""self"" but rather in dissolving it - and noticing that the thing that thinks our thoughts cannot be identical with the thoughts themselves. While the program put forward in the book (and likely the online courses set to begin this September) is a daunting one, it's extremely hard to argue with Harris' reasoning. Who doesn't want to be happier, less neurotic, and more at home in one's own mind? "

5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5448792-b-schrodinger,Rating 1 out of 5,"""A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion"" - sounds great. I feel spiritually stunted yet dread the involvement of religion.The book started out great, thoughts on the use of spirituality with some academic references.Sam then says that to be spiritual without religion you need to lose your sense of self. He then explores the psychology and brain physiology of self and thinks he shows that the self doesn't exist. I followed most of the science, but when the philosophy came into it I was lost.Alright, Sam, what else do you have to offer? Oh, the one true way to do this is to use a Bhuddist meditation technique cutting out the jumbo jumbo. Oh, you studied it yourself with your guru for like ever. Yeah, this is far from religion. How do you do it? Hand wavy stuff and you might want to study it yourself. Why thanks Sam. This really helps out.Oh and now you want to go on about how gurus are often shady characters. Really holding up this argument well, Sam.I couldn't deal with anymore.In summary this is a pamphlet for some Bhuddist hippy shit that Sam got into in his twenties. Note: There are a lot of reviews here that love this book. I definitely know there is a possibility that I was just too dense to get what Sam was on about. But I'm just a scientist who was hoping to develop his spirituality."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32669562-thomas-stroemquist,Rating 2 out of 5,"My first acquaintance with Sam Harris was through one of the many YouTube snippets in which logically reasoning and science advocating people debates different religious people about the existence of god (along with about a million sidetracks). Being Swedish, I found this fascinating for a while (very few Swedes would ever define themselves as 'atheists' - for quite similar reasons why most people do not define themselves as ""non-elf-believers""). I watched a bunch of these, until my fascination with the power of human self-delusion was exhausted and the fascination with Harris' and his team-mates patiences was long gone - and I will probably never have to watch another. I've also never picked up a book by any of the knowledgeables (Harris, Hitchens, Nye, Dawkins...) much for the reason that I know beforehand that I will agree on most counts and the compelling powers of logical reasoning in themselves are not enough to keep interest up for a lengthy text - or so I've always thought. Harris (and Neil deGrasse Tyson) did stand out from the rest of the debate-willing sceptics (yes I do know this is not all these guys do!) by discussing more about how peoples' different beliefs affects all of us - from immediate family all the way through globally, short-term, long-term and impact on development, economics, humanitarian, personal freedom and many other levels. Some debating 'atheists' seem quite content with discussing the plausibility of talking snakes or likewise conversing burning bushes or the possibility of building an impossibly large wooden boat and sail on it for an extended time carrying two of every species on earth. This is why I have been a bit more interested and learned a bit more about and from these two.And so, I was excited to happen upon this book. ""...a scientific and philosophical exploration of the self"" - and that far it's great. Chapter 2, ""The Mystery of Consciousness"" had some very interesting ideas and information, all expressed in Harris' usual eloquent and impeccable style and Chapter 3 ""The Riddle of the Self"" had me largely spellbound. Unfortunately, then the fun ended. ""...and a how-to guide for transcendence"", or the second half of this book contains, much to my chagrin, some of the same logical discrepancies (or at least the missing arguments) for much of the theories and ""practises"" taught that he himself has consistently accused his religious counterparts. First, the author does not offer a single piece of argument - much less evidence - before he jumps head-first into the art of meditation. Long story short: we don't know what thoughts are, how they come to be, how they work or why we have them. But we know that they spin around in our heads every waking hour. And therefore it must be right to try to turn off the flow, right? Wrong. You just jumped the first four questions and they should really be answered before the ""solution"".So now, un-persuaded that I should really meditate for some unclear reasons, lots of the remaining text got less interesting. But that's not the worst. Harris - being a meditation fan - can't really avoid fan-boy:ing the ""masters"" of this trade. Problem is that the ""masters"" do seem to be lacking. Being an ""enlightened"" and ridiculously wise and 'good' person - would it be too much to ask that you refrain from sexually abusing your protégés? Or show a basic understanding of what they are used to, or the codes and ways of the society they where brought up in? Do we really need Sam Harris acting apologist to a bunch of men (always...) that are - by undisclosed standards - above the rest of us, but that are - in the cold light of reasoning - obviously as clueless as most of us? No, that stinks in my opinion. If meditation for some yet unproven reason is what an animal brought forward by millions of years of evolution must do to keep sane - is there one piece of information that leads us to believe that a Tibetan monk or an Indian outcast is the go-to authority on the subject? Asking an old guy, talking in riddles and surprising by obviously having it together in some respects, but sounding like a charlatan in the next instant - does this remind anyone of anything? If Harris meant this to be any sort of primer, he failed miserably. Nowhere in this book did I find the reason to why I should strive to turn off my conscious thoughts (often by focusing on physical phenomena, such as how the bench of choice feels against my buttocks or worrying very much about breathing) for hours on end. Breaking negative thought cycles and breaking free from disabling pondering, I'm convinced is a good idea, from a psychological and personal experience viewpoint. Some people like fishing, I'm into equine therapy myself.Two thought-provoking and great chapters, unfortunately that leaves more than half of this book with a lot more to be wished for."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1339246-gendou,Rating 1 out of 5,"TL;DR the only benefit of meditation is investment justification.This book made me so very sad, because I like the idea of spirituality without religion. Really, this book is about Vipassana meditation and Buddhism. It's just awful, which I never would have expected from Sam Harris.Harris starts off with an accusation that ""few scientists have developed strong skills of introspection"". I've found the opposite to be true, both anecdotally in my personal life and in the biographical literature.The thesis of this book is that we go throughout life ""thinking without being aware that we're thinking"" which is the ""illusion of the self"". If by ""there is no self"" he meant the Cartesian creature is fiction, I would agree.But Harris is a believer in the ""Hard Problem"" of consciousness. He says that consciousness cannot be explained in terms of information processing. He doesn't accept that neuroscience can fully explain the emergence of consciousness by correlating mind states with brain states. ""We know nothing about how such a miracle of emergence might occur."" Well, maybe *you* know nothing about it, but other people do. Don't be fooled. This isn't philosophy. This is science denial. Worse, it's dualism. Plain and simple. Ironically, he rejects dualism in the first chapter.His emphasis on consciousness is also ironic because later on he insists, ""what does not survive scrutiny cannot be real."" Well, the idea that there's something special called consciousness beyond what neuroscience can explain about the brain doesn't survive scrutiny at all! He nonetheless demands the reader accept the subjective experience of consciousness as undeniable evidence for its existence. This is totally unscientific. Subjective experience alone is not falsifiable, subject to independent verification, etc. and so is not scientifically reliable.Harris tries to explain the illusion of the self by comparing it with the optical blind spot. This is a false analogy because the blind spot is real and can be measured. Meditation, on the other hand, produces no physiological or psychological consequences in excess of what we'd expect from undertaking a calming activity.Harris caution the reader about meditation Gurus who abuse the power they have over their disciples. He cautions against believing claims of supernatural powers, though he doesn't dismiss their possibility, either. He sounds particularly credulous to ESP which I find hilarious.I think the overarching problem with this book is that Harris doesn't fully appreciate the philosophy of science. He claims his baloney detector is fully functional, but I think his detection rate would be improved were he to study skepticism and critical thinking.For example, people who claim great benefit from mediation are biased because they've got an imperative to rationalize the large amount of time they spend meditating. This conflict of interest goes unmentioned in the book.Another telling example is when Harris describes an interaction with his young son. His son asked where gravity comes from, and after a thoughtful pause, he replied, ""we don't know where gravity comes from."" Um, yes we do, Sam! Mass! Gravity comes from mass! Duh!Obviously, he was answering the childlike question ""why does gravity behave the way that it does?"" instead of the scientific question ""how does gravity behave?"" Harris seems not to understand that ""why"" questions are invalid in science. Only ""how"" questions are answerable by science."

I'm inspired!!!!!On the bottom of page 43, Sam says, ""I make no claims in support of magic or miracles in this book"".[HE SHOULD!!!!]. 'Miracles' would manifest in the world if enough people read this book.On the same page (bottom of page 43) , Sam goes on to say, ""However, I can say that the true goal of meditation is more profound than most people realize -- and it does, in fact, encompass many of the experiences that traditional mystics claim for themselves. It is quite possible to lose one's sense of being a separate self and to experience a kind of boundless, open awareness -- to feel, in other words, at one with the cosmos."" SAM HARRIS wrote the ABOVE sentences! AMAZING!!! YES?/!!!! (For those who are familiar with Sam's other books --- its pretty cool to see SAM HARRIS writing THESE words. Sam? Cosmos? Sam-the-atheist?Don't let his other AMAZING --LIFE-ALTERATING- books fool you to think Sam does NOT have his own 'spiritual' practice....(so to speak --for lack of a better way to say this). This was the MOST personal -wonderful SAM HARRIS book to date! (he let us see into his personal soul and educated us at the same time). The Chapter on ""The Mystery of Consciousness"" was and entirely new discovery --way of understanding for me. He talked about the 'split-brain' phenomenon. The isolated right hemisphere is independently conscious from the left hemisphere. (He/she does not know what the other is thinking --or even that he/she exists).This chapter is so good--I've already re-read parts of it a few times. I'm still trying to figure it out with my OWN Right & Left brain. For Book clubs that choose NON-FICTION books ---PICK THIS BOOK. Much to chew on for discussions!!!I could go on and on ---but I will leave you with just two more things to consider:1) Read Moral Landscape --(if you've not already). Its a brilliant book that changed my thinking forever!!!!2) ""Where does gravity come from""? Sam's 3 year old daughter wanted to know. Do you? lolGREAT BOOK!!! VERY TOUCHING --(Congrats to SAM!!!!)---- 'EXCELLENT'....[This book is needed 'now' & people might be able to hear the message today].

9,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I received this book through a goodreads sweepstakes. It came in the mail a few days ago. I couldn't put it down after I opened it. All finished reading it within three days. I was baptized Catholic and attended a Catholic school through 8th grade. I was later confirmed Catholic in high school because that was my grandmother's wish for me. The woman is my life, so I do as I'm told, but I never really felt like Catholicism was for me. Way too strict and judgmental. I went to a few other churches to try those out and none of them really fit me. I decided to change from religious to spiritual. This book breaks that all down for the reader. It makes it easy to see why more and more people are choosing to be good people because they believe they should be instead of because a priest or deacon tells them to be. My only complaint is all of the references in the back. Of course I had to cross reference a lot of them for more information, such a sucker for knowledge, so that took a little while.Great book. Worth a buy or a rental. ENJOY!!!!!!!!"
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3897817-morgan-blackledge,Rating 5 out of 5,"If we colonized the moon, people who lived there could ostensibly have a perfectly decent life. But based on our evolutionary inheritance as earthlings, we would, in all likelihood, crave gravity and greenery. This is an interesting analogy to living life as an atheist. We can live quite well without religion. But because so much of our history as humans has revolved around spiritual pursuits, there may be something akin to gravity and greenery that we atheists lack and long for and even need. Personally speaking, there is simply no way for me to accept many of the core premises of the spiritual traditions. Particularly in light of evolutionary biology, neuroscience and psychology. But I still engage in contemplative practices, I still seek the renewal found in total engagement, I still love to meditate in a group, I still love yoga, I still find deep meaning and gratification in being of service to others. There is gravity and greenery in these pursuits. But precisely, what is the spiritual equivalent to gravity and greenery. What exactly is it that we atheists need and crave and more importantly, how can we get it without betraying our rigorous, critical, sceptical, monist selves. This book is Harris's stab at answering these questions. If you're interested in mindfulness or other forms of contemplative practice, and you want a clear, secular context in which to ground your experiences in, than this book may be good news. It certainly is for me.Unlike many other secular, rational presentations of mindfulness and meditation to date. Sam Harris goes for the gold by attempting to construct a secular account of ""enlightenment"". I personally can live without the whole business of enlightenment. At least as it is traditionally rendered. I actually think it's a pernicious myth. But self transcendence (for lack of a better phrase) is something I can't live a full, rich, meaningfull life without. And as far as I can tell, plain old, nuthin fancy, butt normal, no magical powers, self transcendence (again, an awful term without a better alternative) seems to be what Harris is referring to when he uses the term enlightenment, and I'm unreservedly only moderately uncomfortable with that.If you're familiar with Harris's work, you may be as surprised as I was to hear him freely use constructs such as spiritual, ego etc. His rationale was simply that there aren't good alternatives as of yet. Rather than try to create new words, he stuck with the old ones despite the problematic connotations. I nolonger believe in ghosts or souls. So needless to say the word spiritual has been awkward for me for a while. This book is helping me reclaim the word. I'm still taken aback by the fact that the point man of the New Atheist movement, is a former Hindu/Buddhist meditation doing, acid dropping Dharma bum. And he is still all the way in the game. Attempting (like many of us) to make sense of our spiritual and psychedelic experiences based on what we currently know about the brain and psychology (not an easy job).Harris refers to this task as snatching the jewel (i.e. the legitimate value of contemplative practice) from the dung heap (i.e. the cringeworthy religious beliefs/claims/practices of the contemplative, mystical and religious traditions). I knew I loved this guy, but I had no idea how much of a bro he actually is. I have to give him huge props for risking everything and coming out in this way. This is a huge move that will inevitably bring him a torrent of criticism from every angle.If for no other reason, this balls out move compelled me to give the book 5 stars. Harris does a terrific job of parsing out the spiritual use value of psychedelics with out overstating (or understating) their benefit. A subject I have been unsuccessfully wrestling with for years. I know there was immense value in my early psychedelic experiences. I also know they were limited and degenerated into vastly diminished returns by the end of my psychedelic carrier. And I also know that I will not use them again, for various great reasons. Harris takes aim and clarifies this tricky subject in a seemingly effortless paragraph or two, tosses in a hilarious bad trip story for good measure and moves on. I love this guy!It's like the baby boomers had a huge (and unsanitary) spiritual drug orgy and their love child, Sam Harris appeared from behind the bong and cleaned up the intellectual mess without (a) shoveling all of it into the trash, or (b) framing it like it was fine art. Good job bro!I have to say. I've been waiting for someone to write this book. It's not without flaws (I think invoking the ""hard problem"" of consciousness is a major one, I think the very idea that consciousness is a special i.e. magical hard problem is actually creating a bad problem), but I don't feel like dinging him at the moment. For now I'll simply enjoy the feelings I'm having after reading this awesomely interesting, sassy, and even lol funny book.S.H. Rules!"
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3000932-sara-alaee,Rating 4 out of 5,"It’s not long since I’ve first come across the word “spirituality”. I’ve mostly heard it from people who practice meditation. As a beginner I didn’t quite understand it. This book gave me some good ideas. Consciousness is at the core of the book. The hard question is this: What’s consciousness? And where does it come from? I really enjoyed Sam Harris’s reasons and responses to this fundamental question and the wisdom with which he promoted his ideas. His philosophical and scientific arguments regarding the benefits of a mindful life is quite thought-provoking. He addresses consciousness and the issue of “Self” in a clean way, shattering the mysteries of the latter while subscribing to an appropriate explanation of the former: “The feeling that we call “I” is an illusion. There is no discrete self or ego living like a Minotaur in the labyrinth of the brain. And the feeling that there is—the sense of being perched somewhere behind your eyes, looking out at a world that is separate from yourself—can be altered or entirely extinguished.” “Subjectively speaking, the only thing that actually exists is consciousness and its contents. And the only thing relevant to the question of personal identity is psychological continuity from one moment to the next.” He believes that spirituality is an altered state of consciousness that can be induced by contemplative practice or drugs (psychedelics); none of which is in any way dependent to religious beliefs or rituals.There is a bit of neuroscience in the book as Harris tries to demystify consciousness. He also discusses his personal transcendental experiences, first on a drug trip as a young man and then on a tour of Eastern contemplative practices. He then discusses the dangers of being taught about consciousness by imperfect gurus(spiritual teachers). (I’m quite fond of the last chapter. It’s really good.) Despite all the risks, however, Mr. Harris believes that experience of spiritual states can drastically improve the quality of one’s life: “It is within our capacity to recognize the nature of thoughts, to awaken from the dream of being merely ourselves and, in this way, to become better able to contribute to the well-being of others.” “We are always and everywhere in the presence of reality. Indeed, the human mind is the most complex and subtle expression of reality we have thus far encountered. This should grant profundity to the humble project of noticing what it is like to be you in the present. However numerous your faults, something in you at this moment is pristine—and only you can recognize it. Open your eyes and see.”I strongly recommend this book to all, whether one’s a believer, non-believer, questioner, rebel, upholder, abstainer, moderator, and the list goes on… It’s one of the best books written on the subject.

The Four Horsemen of the Non-Apocalypse,
 as they were known, which included Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens and Daniel Dennett. I was devouring books about ""New Atheism"" at the time and I read ""The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason"", and a year or so later, ""Letter to a Christian Nation"", both written by Sam Harris. I enjoyed both books, particularly ""The End of Faith"". Subsequently I re-read ""The End of Faith"" and also acquired and listened to the audiobook.Thinking that perhaps my thoughts about, and my attitude towards, Spirituality might benefit from a relatively short dose of ""Sam Harris"" I started listening to ""Waking Up - A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion"". I guess I should have known better. Life is full of “if onlys” and today’s “if only” is: If only I had read the Goodreads second highest review, by “Chris”, I would have almost certainly not bothered with even loading “Waking Up” into iTunes and then onto my iPhone. Chris said everything about the book and much more than I ever could. However, it is my practice to skim, but not read, a few reviews by my friends and others I follow, prior to listening to a new audiobook. None had written a review, so I ventured into the brave new world of non-religious spirituality unprepared for the dismal, boring narration of ""Waking Up - A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion"".I have written before about authors who record their own audiobooks - in my opinion, with several notable exceptions, they should leave the job to professional readers/narrators. Harris's voice is a monotonous droning, with little inflection or depth. After hearing the words ""read by the author"", I groaned to myself and then my suspicions were confirmed. I listened to the one hour and twenty-seven minutes long first chapter and called it quits."

This is NOT a traditional spiritual book for ""the millions of Americans who want spirituality without religion"" as the description states for Sam Harris has stated on numerous occasions that he DOESN'T BELIEVE in that type of spirituality. Still, this book is being marketed to spiritual people. VERY Disappointed in Sam Harris for putting profit over people and his ethics. I describe this problem in greater detail in an article in The Christian Post.

14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104090874-omar,Rating 2 out of 5,"Sam's ego gets in the way sometimes from meaningful discussion on these topics. He calls world religions intellectual ruins, yet practices a secularized form of Buddhism which has brought profound insight and mental composure to his life. He’s basically taken what’s useful and discarded what isn’t and is under the delusion that he’s separated himself from religion hence the title of the book. He’s a contemplative and a mystic—he’s a kindred spirit to all of those religious people that he thinks he’s above. He’s reluctant to use the word ‘spirituality’ to guard his reputation from being associated to intellectually ‘inferior’ people going as far as to say that he’s looking to ‘rehabilitate’ the word. He just comes off as very insecure with this dimension to his life, but if you can look past all of that you may find some very interesting scientific discussion that makes the case for why everyone should be meditating and practicing mindfulness, particularly as a tool to interrogate our sense of self.On the self, again, Sam lifts from the Buddhists and argues that the sense of having a persistent and unified self is an illusion. He says that the self is built upon processes that are 'transitory and multifarious'. He takes things a step further than the Buddhists though by citing current science while tying it to the notion of free will. He explains how consciousness precedes the self and that the totality of our inner lives being attributed to the self would be erroneous but rather are contents of consciousness. Consciousness is what essentially observes the self (the ‘I’). The illusion is that we think we're the thinkers of our thoughts and that the ego and our sense of volition are simply objects in our subjective experience and the product of brain activity to which we inherently have no real control over but have the strong perception that we do . What is certainly real to Sam is that we are having a conscious experience---everything else may be illusory---so our lives are simply an interactive movie and unconscious processes are writing the script. My main issue with all of this is that he can’t sufficiently explain what consciousness is or how it’s possible therefore to make the leap and explain how the mind works is a bit overzealous. Also, his writing at times is quite paradoxical on this matter which is quite revealing:""An ability to examine the contents of one's consciousness clearly, dispassionately, and nondiscursively, with sufficient attention to realize that no inner self exists, is a very sophisticated skill. And yet basic mindfulness can be practiced very early in life. Many people, including my wife, have successfully taught it to children as young as six. At that age--and every age thereafter--it can be a powerful tool for self-regulation and self-awareness""So becoming self-aware that you have no-self is a powerful tool for self-regulation. Makes total sense Sam. Who is the one being mindful?? His response would be an 'impartial pure awareness' and that the self behind the thoughts is an illusory and transitory entity as well. I just don't see the utility in any of this as the self is emergent, whether it's illusory or not, and serves a useful function so why all the 'hacks' to dismantle it? For therapeutic purposes? Does he reduce spirituality to a dissociative technique to dismantle stress in order to manage stress while experience a sense of oneness? Again, that's called Buddhism. Now, he does mention that the psychological continuous self is a very real component to our lives and is an autobiographical account of our experience that we live each moment as a continuation of our former selves so to those worried that you may be 'losing' something with exposure to these ideas---you won't (everything of value isn't an illusion). I can't help but feel that these ideas on the self may just be intellectual gymnastics that may have philosophical implications, but not very practical ones apart from facilitating a richer meditative experience if your belief systems align. At the end of the day, people are going to go about their lives with a strong sense of self--the ego is a part of being human whether it's illusory or not. Sam even writes: ""Nothing I say here is intended as a denial of the fact that psychological well-being requires a healthy ""sense of self""--with all the capacities that this vague phrase implies. Children need to become autonomous, confident, and self-aware in order to form health relationships. And they must acquire a host of other cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal skills in the process of becoming sane and productive adults""So don't take the no-self stuff too seriously.Bottom Line:I really don't understand the title for this book as he spends most of his time essentially promoting Buddhism. He travelled to both Nepal and India to study Buddhism and Hinduism as he explored spirituality so this book should have been titled Waking Up: A Secular Approach to Eastern Spirituality because he lifts all of his ideas and meditation practices from those religions. A lot of the science mentioned here seemed crude and wasn't convincing either. Consciousness is not understood yet to rule our free will and by extension the self. Our biology and the universe is not completely understood yet to jump to conclusions. The irony behind Sam's spiritual philosophy is that it's a very self-centered personal exploration whereas for others, including the religions he criticizes, its a selfless journey involving community building and tolerance. His disdain for religion is driven by ego and the need for intellectual superiority, but in the process he's detached himself from others and the richness in diversity. A little bit of humility on his part may change his life for the better. You don't need to piss people off on your way towards 'enlightenment'. A much better read is ""Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment"" by Robert Wright---less pretentious with better insight on secular spirituality for the modern person. Lastly, a quote from Christopher Hitchens:""“Oriental religions, with their emphasis on Nirvana and fatalism, are repackaged for Westerners as therapy...""That sums up this book and Sam's quasi-guru schtick to cash in with this repackaged form of Buddhism. 2/5"

I just kept waiting for him to really apply what he was writing about. He went on and on about how beneficial mediation is, especially dzogchen, and how important it is to be taught exactly how to do it, instead of being taught in metaphor. But then he never talked about how to actually do it. Maybe that was outside the scope of his book. I was also looking forward to the chapter on psychedelics, but was disappointed to find that much of it was lifted from a couple of his blog posts from his site that I had already read a while ago. Overall, it's still worth reading. Original review:I can't believe I have to wait 5 more months for this to come out."

In the past we had Leibniz's monads and Descarte's homunculus unsatisfactorily explaining consciousness. 'Cogito ergo sum' gave western thought the mistaken impression that there is a single self inside the brain. The author suggests another path for understanding the hard question namely gaining self awareness (of our non-existence) through meditation from which one can discover the illusion of the self which leads the individual to 'enlightenment' and the realization that the 'self' does not exist.The author puts his spiritualism without mysticism in to context by reasonably looking at how we think about thinking and gives the listener just enough names of the brain parts without overwhelming the listener, and all the time supporting his path to self understanding by learning to first deny the self.In the end the author thinks that the denial of self leads to a greater understandings about who we are and that a guru or some selective use of drugs will help the listener achieve enlightenment and lead to a more ethical person with greater appreciation for life. As for me, I think I'll continue learning about the universe by looking outside of myself and use reason, coupled with empirical data (induction) and properly constructed models and seek enlightenment that way and not get a guru or use drugs and spend too much time thinking about denying myself through meditation and self reflection.

A surgeon rushes to his side to begin the work of saving his life, but the man resists these ministrations. He first wants to know the name of the fletcher who fashioned the arrow’s shaft, the genus of the wood from which it was cut, the disposition of the man who shot it, the name of the horse upon which he rode, and a thousand other things that have no bearing upon his present suffering or his ultimate survival. The man needs to get his priorities straight. His commitment to thinking about the world results from a basic misunderstanding of his predicament. And though we may be only dimly aware of it, we, too, have a problem that will not be solved by acquiring more conceptual knowledge.""The term 'Spirituality' is more colluded with religious doctrines obliviously. And over time, many presume that both are the two sides of a same coin. Astronomers and Astrophysicists, Physicists like Sagan, Neil Tyson, Brian Cox gets some of us 'spiritually' enlightened, getting awe with the depth of understanding than previously believed possible when they start talking lyrically about their specialized fields. Some Writers like Shakespeare, Kurt Vonnegut(personal option) make many people realise that they could lead a happier life, prouder to be alive than previously believed possible. Musical artists like Beethoven, Mozart make the same using the tools and medium they knew. Now, take a religious person listening to a 'Spiritual' Guru, he would feel connected and profound relevantness of his existence with respect to that Guruji's words and view of world. Sam Harris connects the word with understanding the brain and it contents both physical and emergent, of course rational content free of dogma, which is equally important to knowing the worldly facts and phenomena.The Book deals with signifying the importance of being ""spiritual"" which the author implies removing the illusion of self. By ""illusion of self"" he meant that the illusion of inner-self, some kind of agenticity within our body having control over it which adds up concepts of soulful mind duality, and freewill stuffs. And breaking this illusion of the self, he says that our minds can have different and better 'conscious' experiences irrespective of our emotional states. It's not a matter of thinking more clearly about experience; it is the act of experiencing more clearly, including the arising of thoughts themselves and the problem is not thoughts themselves but the state of thinking without being fully aware that we are thinking. Even though he explained things in simpler terms, I felt like I was listening to the most complicated man alive. He explored the split brain phenomena, Nature of Consciousness, Contemporary meditation techniques as per the western as well as the Eastern cultural and psychological understanding, the yogis, gurus who were considered as enlightened (still many consider themselves enlightened) in context to the core objective of enabling the readers to understand about our mind a little better and more profound. He also had his exquisite intellectual ponderings on the effects and usage of 'drugs'. The term 'drugs' collectively defines a wide variety of neurotransmitters and chemical enhancers of neural activities in which substances in both category has both neurotoxic, epileptic as well as excrescence enhancing tool for consciousness. Collectively labelling them as 'drugs' disables us to have intellectual discussion on the ethical, psychological, biological, legal effects amd usage of such substances like Psilobin, DMT, Ketamine, LSD, MDMA (commonly known as Ecstasy), etc.,. It is also worth noting that some substances stereotypically labelled as 'drug' has lesser effects than widely legalised Alcoholics and tobacco.""The power of psychedelics, however, is that they often reveal, in the span of a few hours, depths of awe and understanding that can otherwise elude us for a lifetime.""He repeated the phenomena many times with various illustrations to make sure the listeners/readers could really understand and ponder out the stuffs. As Carl Sagan once said, Brain is a small place with a very enormous space and capabilities.He used fluids to define the nature and physical foundation of consciousness, as emergent phenomena.""Consciousness is the prior condition of every experience; the self or ego is an illusory appearance within it; look closely for what you are calling I, and the feeling of being a separate self will disappear; what remains, as a matter of experience, is a field of consciousness—free, undivided, and intrinsically uncontaminated by its ever-changing contents.""Even though I've already read a book of Sam Harris on Free Will, i got to know more about him than being a skeptical neuroscience spokesperson. His early life encounters with drugs, in search of his spiritual encounters inside USA. While he was in his 2nd year at Stanford, he took off 11 years to spend time in India and Nepal, trying to understand the case of which he described briefly in this book.""I have long argued that confusion about the unity of religions is an artifact of language. Religion is a term like sports: Some sports are peaceful but spectacularly dangerous (“free solo” rock climbing); some are safer but synonymous with violence (mixed martial arts); and some entail little more risk of injury than standing in the shower (bowling). To speak of sports as a generic activity makes it impossible to discuss what athletes actually do or the physical attributes required to do it. What do all sports have in common apart from breathing? Not much. The term religion is hardly more useful.The same could be said of spirituality. The esoteric doctrines found within every religious tradition are not all derived from the same insights. Nor are they equally empirical, logical, parsimonious, or wise. They don’t always point to the same underlying reality—and when they do, they don’t do it equally well.""Well for general audience, there's nothing novel about this work; Its just about trying to become happy. The Conventional sources of happiness aren't always reliable depending upon various transient conditions. It is difficult to raise a family happily, to keep yourself and the people you love healthy, to acquire wealth and find creative and fulfilling ways to enjoy it, to form deep relationships, to contribute to society in ways that are emotionally rewarding, to perfect a wide variety of skills—and to keep the machinery of happiness running day after day.See if you can stop thinking for the next sixty seconds. You can notice your breath, or listen to the birds, but do not let your attention be carried away by thought, any thought, even for an instant. Keep away from mobile or computer, and give it a try.""If your golf instructor were to insist that you shave your head, sleep no more than four hours each night, renounce sex, and subsist on a diet of raw vegetables, you would find a new golf instructor.""There is no question that novel and intense experiences—whether had in the company of a guru, on the threshold of death, or by recourse to certain drugs—can send one spinning into delusion. But they can also broaden one’s view.Before trying this book, I've checked the reviews of this work and found too many negative reception about it. Many of them indicated themselves as ardent followers of Sam Harris by his support and critical views on religion and his science popularizing façade but disappointed with Sam Harris for supporting the Meditation via 'buddhist' techniques and this illusionary concept of 'self' and many didn't feel like it's science at all because of confusing usage of consciousness. Sam did answer those things in the book itself,""Search your mind, or pay attention to the conversations you have with other people, and you will discover that there are no real boundaries between science and any other discipline that attempts to make valid claims about the world on the basis of evidence and logic. When such claims and their methods of verification admit of experiment and/or mathematical description, we tend to say that our concerns are scientific; when they relate to matters more abstract, or to the consistency of our thinking itself, we often say that we are being philosophical; when we merely want to know how people behaved in the past, we dub our interests historical or journalistic; and when a person’s commitment to evidence and logic grows dangerously thin or simply snaps under the burden of fear, wishful thinking, tribalism, or ecstasy, we recognize that he is being religious.""Overall, I feel the book is well worth reading, pondering out our brain stuffs. Though the brief summary of the book is very simple but one has to go through every word vigilantly, to avoid confusion, to avoid misconceptions. So I wouldn't recommend it for all."
19,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"So. Sam Harris felt the need to publish a book that states, without novel argument, what everyone already knew. One that doubles as a guide to being a dipshit dogmatist on the irreligious side of the binary. He also deems it necessary to inform us right off the bat of his mind-expansion under the influence of MDMA. Which, man, at least begin the book by talking about a non-stupid psychedelic if you're going to rant about this transformative event in your life that pretty much exactly parallels every secular person's experience with psychedelic trips.And if you don't know anything about mindfulness or meditation practices, information is everywhere. Sam Harris gives a half-decent overview at certain points, but you're better off getting your information from other sources. Most of which are freely available online. And I mean, shit, that Jack Kornfield guy isn't particularly invested in any religious doctrines. If you come across evidence of doctrines that don't resonate with you, just ignore them. I know the covers of Kornfield's books make him seem pukey and the Spirit Rock website is laden with images of creepily smiling middle-class, middle-aged white people, but. And the guy's a legitimate authority in the Western Buddhist tradition.I'm no friend of organized religion or woo-woo new agey shit, guys. Those of you who know me know this. But my position on organized religion does not create an obligation to take Harris at his word. In fact, basic examination of much of what Harris says (in this book and in others) reveals an extraordinary lack of basic scholarly skill and critical thought. I mean, this guy got decimated in an argument with JOE FUCKING ROGAN. Not that Joe Rogan is an idiot. But that the Fear Factor/DMT/I-got-high-and-have-Ganesha-statues guy could so easily demonstrate the faults in the thinking of one of our most visible and well-regarded public intellectuals really says something about the quality of our public intellectuals. Okay, so I dislike Sam Harris. But I'll give him some credit for writing a clear enough book about why meditating or doing something similar does not automatically render one a new age loony and about how valid and true many ideas from Buddhist thought are even in a scientific, rational context.Finally, and this concerns mostly the ""I'm going to meditate and not consider Buddhist thought at all"" crowd more than Harris himself, perhaps: I think there is potential value in entering a sacred traditional practice with something resembling the mindset of people who actually believe the practice is ""religious"" (if the meditation of Theravadin Buddhists is considered religious in the same way as prayer). If you're assured enough in your agnosticism or atheism, entering practices with the traditional context in mind can help maintain the integrity of the practice itself. Otherwise, you end up with braided asshole stoners going to yoga class to hit on chicks in yoga pants and laugh at the teacher's accent and pay no attention to the fucking yoga. There are miles between ""I'm going to ignore what yoga means and why it exists; this is just like going to the gym"" and ""I'm yoking myself to the gods and this area in my lower spine is going to cure all my ailments"" or whatever the fuck. Similarly, there are miles between ""I'm going to do this weird meditation thing and it's not real anyway so I don't have to listen to the teachers and understand its foundations"" and ""meditation will bring about a good rebirth and help me attain literal nirvana."""

Was the firebrandtype philosopher and scientist—co-founder of Project Reason and author of The End of Faith and Letter to a Christian Nation—changing teams?Nah.Perhaps a better title for this book, though, would be The Atheist’s Guide to Meditation.At its core, Waking Up is about mindfulness, and as a fellow atheist who has attended a fair share of Buddhist retreats (including a recent one on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction), I can relate to some of the conflicts Harris encounters. No matter how secular the retreat, I get nervous when I find myself in a room full of people following the direction of a group leader offering spiritual betterment.Harris takes out the touchy-feely and goes straight for the scientific foundation of a mindfulness-based approach to life. The result is a book heavy on Buddhist philosophy and refreshingly light on bullshit.What makes Waking Up different is that it’s also what Harris calls a “seeker’s memoir.” We follow his journey from a skeptical teen to an adult struggling with the feelings of “unsatisfactoriness”—which is his interpretation of the concept of dukkha, rather than the traditional definition of suffering.He had my attention early in the book, when describing the disquiet of his solitary thoughts and the relief he felt when experimenting with MDMA, LSD and DMT: “It would not be too strong to say that I felt sane for the first time in my life.”Through his seeking, Harris reveals that, for him, spirituality is not the existence of a higher being in the ethereal realm, but rather the cognizance one has of an immaterial self. “Subjectively speaking, the only thing that actually exists is consciousness and its contents. And the only thing relevant to the question of personal identity is psychological continuity from one moment to the next.”Speaking of continuity, Harris gets a little far afield the deeper we delve into the book. Beyond memoir, he explores the scientific underpinnings of consciousness and meditation, drops some knowledge about psychedelic drugs and, justifiably, rants on the silliness (and scientific dishonesty) of Proof of Heaven and other accounts of near-death experiences.While I really enjoyed many of these sections, they didn’t have the cohesion of a linear narrative. It read more like a collection of essays on a single topic—which is fine, just not what I was expecting.Harris’ informed and enlightened discussion of psychedelics resonates the most with me. Not only do I agree with his observations (and share some of his experiences), but Harris also challenges some of my long-held assumptions.For instance, Aldous Huxley’s Doors of Perception is a seminal bit of psychedelic literature, and for years I bought in fully to Huxley’s description of the brain as a “reducing valve.” Harris debunks this by drawing on modern neuroscience, causing me to think about mind-manifesting drugs in a new way.All told, Waking Up is an interesting and enjoyable read. There’s a bit of science writing, philosophy, memoir and a unique take on spirituality and meditation."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6899594-alex,Rating 2 out of 5,"Wow! Where to begin? This book is extremely cerebral. Sam is a clearly a skeptic towards many things related to spirituality, which is fine, but his extreme judgment toward various religions comes seeping through his text. That is, except for Buddhism, which he often seems to put on a pedestal. I felt disillusioned by the book, based on the cover. It should have said this was a philosopher's guide to spirituality. And how true that is! Make sure you're awake and a pot of coffee before reading! He writes in a fairly highfalutin way and certainly doesn't wait for you to catch up on where he is headed. He is very opinionated and had a haughty tone throughout.And it’s apparent his intended audience appears to be other educated philosophers or at least neuroscientists. If that wasn’t his intention, then he has certainly failed at trying to reach a broad audience. The majority of the book read more like a college textbook than a book meant for the lay reader. He got too bogged down in superfluous details about the brain and it got in the way. And many of the studies he referenced were irrelevant to his central thesis (which that itself was unclear). As a psychologist, I almost always find information on the brain interesting, but I can easily see how most people would check out with glossy eyes after the first few studies he cites. It got so intense, I couldn't help but fear he was writing a textbook on psychophysiology or neuroscience and accidentally wrote in this book instead! This seemed to intensify around the midway mark. (Later, he did begin to get back on track with spirituality, but again from a stripped down Buddhist/meditation perspective and kept his ideas to primarily this vein.) I also realized around this time that his description of spirituality, and thus the book, was really just a covert autobiography of his OWN route to spirituality; however, instead of coming clean and conceptualizing from this way, he came from a perspective of being judgmental and projecting his scientific skepticism to any other route to the Divine than what he has found. It was almost like he was saying, “Hey, I was a very judgy, skeptical, and depressed person and found my way to spirituality via Buddhist meditation, so therefore this is THE way to being spiritual, and everything else is fanciful, hyped up crap, and the only other options to explore spirituality are either Dogmatic religions or New Age woo woo.”It was just disappointing how narrow minded he was, especially for pointing the finger at others who come from (although he's right here) that same narrow-minded place. I would have thought someone who is writing about spirituality would be more inclusive and open minded to how there can be a VARIETY of ways to the divine: multiple ways to the mountain top. Waking Up is also extremely theoretical and conceptual in nature. And don’t go in hoping he will give you a number of exercises either. While he does offer a suggestion here and there, they're rare, vague, and not always practical.Toward the end he starts a discourse on mind-altering (illegal) drugs. He shares his own use of DMT and other drugs, briefly noting the realistic fears and dangers that come from such use (both from personal experience and in a general sense), but then goes on to conclude his desire for his young girls to try LSD or other psychedelics when they become teens/early adults, saying otherwise they would have “missed one of the most important rites of passage a human being can experience.” Huh?! I was appalled he would write such a thing so openly in a book! Then, later, he contradicts himself saying that there are natural ways to get every sort of synthetic high.Overall, the book left me feeling very unsettled, like a real bad taste in my mouth after a mediocre meal. At the end, I was still hung up on his viewpoints of frivolity with having his daughters take LSD, or how he'd repeatedly lump Spirituality into the Religion category. To quickly summarize his book in a few sentences: In order to be more spiritual and less religious, disregard all mainstream religions (save Buddhism which I put on a pedestal) because they are silly, trite, and filled with barely anything more than fanciful, imaginal, illogical, and mostly untrue ideas. Practice mindfulness and follow most of what Buddhism says and call it a day. Oh, and if you want to learn about semi relevant (at best) studies conducted on various parts of the brain, I’ve included this as well for your reading pleasure.But I also don’t want to only dog on the book. There were some valid points he touched on and some quotes I enjoyed. If you're a scientist or atheist who is allergic to any sense of religion, metaphysics, or modern sense of spirituality and are in the very first stages of ""waking up"" (i.e., in the “I'm not awake stage but just beginning to recognize that I might not fully be dreaming”) then you might benefit from this book."
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ever since the planes crashed into the Twin Towers, Sam Harris has been making the argument that we can no longer afford the luxury of religious belief. In his writings, he has explained his theories about not only why the unproven beliefs of dogma are so dangerous, but also how many of the benefits that religion provides can be found in secular places. In Waking Up, Harris addresses the issue of what he terms ""spiritual"" states - altered states of consciousness that can be spontaneous or induced by things like contemplative practice or drugs. Most religions point to such states as proof of their assertion that there is a world beyond this one. Harris, however, uses these pages to argue that a.) they do no such thing, and b.) they are worth cultivating anyway.There is a fair bit of neuroscience in this book as Harris delves into what we currently know about consciousness. He also discusses his personal experiences with transcendent states, first on an Ecstasy drug trip and later as a rationalist in deep study of Eastern contemplative practices. He also discusses the risks of both of those paths, including the dangerously unpredictable impact of psychedelics and the hazards of attempting to learn about consciousness from imperfect human teachers.Despite the risks, however, Harris's book is an unapologetic argument that the cultivation and experience of spiritual states can drastically improve the quality of one's life. I agree with Harris about a number of things, including that experience of such states can be potentially life changing. I also agree that there is an urgent need for people who experience such states to be given an opportunity to understand them outside the context of a particular religion or the New Age book aisle. Where I am not totally on board, however, is with his assertion that people who have never experienced such states should try to do so. Harris believes that the cultivation of such states can reduce human misery and suffering. I don't doubt that's been true for Harris and for many others. What I question is whether or not consciously exploring such states can work for everyone. As I understand it, the current research on meditation as not sufficiently answered the question of whether people who seem to be experiencing the benefits of contemplative practice do so because the contemplative practice actually changed them or because they had brain chemistry that predisposed them to self-select for contemplative practice in the first place. Harris himself acknowledges that traditional concentration practice has significant limitations, and the value offered by pointing-out practices is often lost on those who are exposed to it without previous context.The role of psychedelic drugs in Harris' own journey also raises questions for me - did that fundamentally alter his brain chemistry in such a way that he was enabled to have experiences he couldn't have had without those drugs? Ultimately, I'm not certain someone starting from scratch could induce the kind of experiences Harris describes by following his instructions. I think it's a question well worth asking, and I applaud Harris for asking it. I'm just not quite as convinced of the answer as he is."

While these states of mind are usually interpreted through the lens of one or another religious doctrine, we know that this is a mistake. Nothing that a Christian, a Muslim, and a Hindu can experience—self-transcending love, ecstasy, bliss, inner light—constitutes evidence in support of their traditional beliefs, because their beliefs are logically incompatible with one another. A deeper principle must be at work.""What Sam means by ""spirituality"" is: 'The feeling that we call “I” is an illusion. There is no discrete self or ego living like a Minotaur in the labyrinth of the brain. And the feeling that there is—the sense of being perched somewhere behind your eyes, looking out at a world that is separate from yourself—can be altered or entirely extinguished. Although such experiences of “self-transcendence” are generally thought about in religious terms, there is nothing, in principle, irrational about them. From both a scientific and a philosophical point of view, they represent a clearer understanding of the way things are. Deepening that understanding, and repeatedly cutting through the illusion of the self, is what is meant by “spirituality” in the context of this book.'This book looks much more interesting than it actually is. let's just say... I din't hold my pee once to continue reading.I might have skipped 3/5 of this book, simply for the lack of interest, but the remaining 2/5 are extremely valuable, intriguing, and make me glad ""thank God"" I didn't drop it altogether.

For every minute I spent reading, I spent another 2 minutes thinking about what I'd just read. And some of it just sailed past me, no matter how hard I tried to understand it. Harris is a clear writer, one of the clearest, so I have to assume my own cognitive limitations are at fault and not his power of explanation. Still, I can't quite grant a full 5 stars to a book that I didn't fully grasp.I got a lot of it, though. I'm an atheist who took an 8-week class in mindfulness meditation, and I meditate regularly. I studied Buddhism a bit in college and decided that of all the religions, it was my favorite, because it was more like a philosophy than a religion. I have Buddhas all over my house. But I am a scientific-minded materialist, so I could never fully embrace Eastern religions because they are just too laden with, well, religion. Like most atheists, I have an allergy to the word ""spiritual"" because it seems like an unnecessarily woo-laden term for a normal, entirely earthly emotional experience. This book was exactly right for me, then, because Harris is open to Eastern spirituality but will not sacrifice his Western rationality to the cause. He has his feet completely on the ground, he's inoculated against silliness. As someone who wanted to bolster her meditation practice, and get better at finding that self-less place of equanimity, I was really ready for Harris's approach. And it did help. The self-portrait of Ernst Mach, in particular, gave me a jarring sense of sudden understanding. (Jarring in the way that the Rubin vase illusion is jarring when you suddenly see two faces instead of a vase, or vice-versa.) I also enjoyed his writing about drugs, especially psychedelics. His paragraph about his hopes for his two daughters, in relation to drugs, was almost eerily similar to my own advice to my kids about drugs, maybe because our experiences are/were somewhat similar. Though I only tried psychedelic drugs a few times and never had a bad trip—thankfully. I knew exactly what he was talking about when he discussed what such drugs do to your consciousness, and the possibilities they bring to light. But he seems to indicate meditation practices can get one somewhere near those experiences, and mine certainly never have. (Then again, I haven't spent months in silent retreats in Tibet.)The bit about gurus was very entertaining but not so useful to me. He's worried about people who might get snared by charlatans, and that is a legitimate worry, but it seems somewhat unlikely that people who are reading a book by Sam Harris are especially credulous. Still, it's always a good reminder that one should not allow oneself to become abused in the service to any spiritual goals, and that anyone who insists you need to do harmful things in order to achieve enlightenment is someone you should avoid. I think this is a good book for someone like me, someone who is familiar with Buddhism, who is attracted to its teachings, but who is not keen on religion. It's useful for someone who knows something about neuroscience and philosophy. It's a good addition to Harris's other writings. If someone is entirely new to any of this, I'm not sure this book will sit well. The requirements for the ""right"" audience seem fairly stringent.I do recommend the audiobook. Harris narrates it himself and there's something about his inflection that helps make the meaning of his words clearer. That's not always true with writers who narrate their own books, though you'd think it would be. He gets into some difficult concepts, and hearing his voice somehow made it easier for me to understand. That being said, the paper book has diagrams and images that are also necessary to understanding. So: check 'em both out. (Thank you, public library.)"

But NO - just NO.So here we have the next big THANG for world religions and Cultural spiritism: Religionless religion - for the lazy atheists who don't want to get up Sunday Morning, but don't really want to feel left out during the Starbucks spiritual chats ---- ""I'M SPIRITUAL TOO.""the fun part is knowing that all those hardcore internet atheists (and first year humanistic atheistic philosophy/sociology students at your local college) have really lost Sam Harris from their Skeptical Free-Thinkers hate Club. Harris is NOT really an atheist - he's more of a Buddhist Guru who can't really define his god. So he assumes it's himself. (Is this much different than Hindu's and their Monkey Gods? Possibly no.)So this book is about Sam Waking UP to some kind of cosmic consciousness. Soon maybe he'll start dressing like a Hari Krishna and chanting about Cosmic enlightenment and Peace (If you buy enough of his books that is - or maybe financially he'll have no choice if you don't Buy Buy Buy?)But sam is still clueless and full of crap - but rather than Atheistic Crap: It's NEW and improved Spiritual CRAP. (1/3 less filling, and you can sleepin Sundays and never have to tithe or repent.)I haven't noticed him dealing with the hellbeings, hungry ghosts, and Demi-gods of Buddhism yet? He better not buddy up with the Dalai Lama too quickly - they got a lot of religious dogma and doctrine to work through before they chant in caves and share their hippy herbs. And Mr. Lama has some women's issues that Sam is going to have to straighten him out on."

Sam wants to assure his readership that he still belongs with them - and with Dawkins and Hitchens and Sagan - even as he takes a step further and talks about Spiritual Awakening. He wants to suggest that there is nothing irrational about spirituality the way he defines it. Problem is: He isn't the greatest explorer of spirituality. The question for me was: why should I trust you to tell me that astrology is bullshit and ghosts do not exist but love is the substrate of the universe? Which is to say, why you are qualified to tell me the boundaries of what is irrational and what is rational to accept in spirituality?Sam Harris is smart.

28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60074558-xander,Rating 3 out of 5,"It took a long time for me to read this book. I hesitated, I put it away, even though I truly admire Sam Harris - in my opinion one of the most clearest thinkers of our time. Why did I do this? Because I always associated spirituality with quacks, strange cults and vague esoteric and mystical illusions.I don't know why I finally picked up this book and started reading - but I am glad I did. It really offered me gems of insight that I could never have anticipated. And after reading Waking Up (2014), I admire Harris even more.So what is this book about? As its title indicates, Harris wants to offer a secular approach to spirituality. On the one hand, he wants to take the monopolistic claim on spirituality out of the hands of the superstitious and mythical religions; on the other hand, he wants to take a stand against the ignorance, disdain and self-complacency with regard to spirituality that many scientists show. Sam Harris is a philosopher and neuroscientist, and he uses three quarters of the book to approach spirituality from these perspectives. This means that he constructs arguments based on scientific knowledge about the mind, as well as thought experiments. The strength of the book though, lies in the one quarter in which Harris adds his own personal experiences to illustrate what he means.The message of the book, in summary, is as follows:Each of us is continually thinking about everything. Long trains of thoughts, sometimes partly unconscious, are only interrupted by rational goal setting. We want that new job, this new relationship, etc. This leads to suffering - we never 'live' in the moment of now, continuously busy with our thoughts and desires. Consequently, most of us experience feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction.According to Harris, there are some Eastern traditions, especially buddhism, which have discovered insights (hundreds or even thousands of years ago) that are now being vindicated in the neuroscience labs around the world. Meditation, of which mindfulness is the most accessible and known form, can make us aware of our continuous thinking. Once we notice this - and this takes much practice - we experience our thoughts as just that - thoughts. Through meditative practice we can learn to dissociate the contents of our consciousness - our thoughts - from consciousness itself. This leads to a happier, healthier and more satisfied life. One of the strongest experiences of our consciousness, is the concept of 'self', 'I' or the 'Ego': the subjective center that experiences everything and that guides our behaviour, thoughts and movement. According to Harris, this 'self' is an illusion - and meditation can help us get rid of this illusion, if only for a few seconds or minutes. One of the interesting ways that he demonstrates this is by giving the example of split-brain patients, who - due to a surgical intervention, cutting the corpus callosum and hence severing the two halves of the brain - seem to possess two distinct consciousnesses. This illustrates that consciousness is divisible, and hence, that the idea of 'a self' is an illusion. There is absolutely no such thing as a 'self', and the moment we start to look for it - in other words: use introspection to study our 'self' - it disappears. This disappearing of the self is what buddhist teachings call self-transcendence: the momentary feeling that the self disappears and that we experience our consciousness as it 'just is' - all the experiences and thoughts passing by. Harris' book is both an exposition of buddhist teachings in accessible language, backed up by the most modern scientific insights, as well as a plea to practice meditation (especially mindfulness). This is, in effect, what Harris calls spirituality - the experience of loss of self, if only for a couple of seconds or minutes (and only after many hours of practice) and the continuous realization that our thoughts are just thoughts, their contents do not (have to) affect us in the least. I am convinced of the truth of his position on spirituality. I would never have thought I would say this, seeing myself as an extremely rational thinker and one who demands the stamp of approval of either science or logic to believe a proposition to be true. Yet, Harris offers an answer to both: the results of neuroscience are perfectly compatible with the insights of meditation, and the plea for (the benefits of) meditation can be perfectly constructed as a rational argument.It is very worthwile to quote Harris on this point:""A middle path exists between making religion out of spiritual life and having no spiritual life at all.[...]Everything we take ourselves to be at the level of our subjectivity—our memories and emotions, our capacity for language, the very thoughts and impulses that give rise to our behavior—depends upon distinct processes that are spread out over the whole of the brain. Many of these can be independently interrupted or extinguished. The sense, therefore, that we are unified subjects— the unchanging thinkers of thoughts and experiencers of experience—is an illusion. The conventional self is a transitory appearance among transitory appearances, and it vanishes when looked for. We need not await any data from the lab to say that self-transcendence is possible. And we need not become masters of meditation to realize its benefits. It is within our capacity to recognize the nature of thoughts, to awaken from the dream of being merely ourselves and, in this way, to become better able to contribute to the well-being of others.""Throughout the book, Harris offers approaches to start meditating yourself, and tries to illuminate hard to digest subjects by offering thought experiments and analogies. This makes Waking Up not only a very interesting read (from a scientific or philosophical perspective), but also a very handy tool to start practicing yourself. In the last chapter, Harris goes a little bit too far for my taste: explaining how to judge the trustworthiness and ethical norms of teachers, proving the fallacies in near-death experiences and advocating the use of psychedelics as a way of opening your mind (i.e. experiencing that what we daily perceive as consciousness isn't all there is to experience). I should add two caveats to this last point, though: Harris clearly states that the ingestion of mind-altering substances isn't the same as meditation, and that it is definitely not suited for everyone. Yet, I admire Harris' try to wrest spirituality from religious hands and to offer us, rational and scientifically informed individuals, an approach to experience more to this universe than just the 'cold hard facts' of experiment and observation.I just know this is one of the books that truly changed my view on something important in life, and that I will consequently remember it and its message for a long time. I love this experience of 'sudden new insights', and I am thankful that Harris offered me this experience with Waking Up.------------------------------------------------One additional note: I have previous experiences with mindfulness. I once tried to start practice it, when I was in a dire personal situation. I ended up being frustrated that I couldn't seem to shake all the thoughts off that would go through my mind 24/7. I took this frustration as a sign that mindfulness simply wasn's something for me. When reading Waking Up, I realized that my frustration was exactly a sign of progress: once you start noticing your thoughts, you will immediately notice their penetrating presence throughout the whole day. If I understand Harris' view correctly, this was just the first step in practicing meditation. The next step should be to sever the connection between the contents of these thoughts (i.e. not act on them) and you being conscious of them (along with any other experience you might perceive).It is, from a personal perspective, very interesting that I feel moments of this supposedly next phase in meditation during running excercises. When I run 10-15 km, at a decent pace of 11-12 km/h, I seem to end up in this trance-like state where thoughts will just pass by - I notice them, but don't really have the energy (or will?) to act on them. This truly feels very pleasant - it is the primary reason why I run at least two times a week - and I wonder if there's any connection between 'runner's high' and self-transcendence..."

Until we can talk about spirituality in rational terms— acknowledging the validity of selftranscendence— our world will remain shattered by dogmatism. What does a spiritual experience mean? If you are a Christian sitting in church, it might mean that Jesus Christ survived his death and has taken a personal interest in the fate of your soul. If you are a Hindu praying to Shiva, you will have a very different story to tell. Altered states of consciousness are empirical facts, and human beings experience them under a wide range of conditions. To understand this, and to seek to live a spiritual life without deluding ourselves, we must view these experiences in universal and secular terms.Happiness and suffering, however extreme, are mental events. The mind depends upon the body, and the body upon the world, but everything good or bad that happens in your life must appear in consciousness to matter. This fact offers ample opportunity to make the best of bad situations— changing your perception of the world is often as good as changing the world— but it also allows a person to be miserable even when all the material and social conditions for happiness have been met. During the normal course of events, your mind will determine the quality of your life.Everything about my mind and body seems to feel the weight of the past. I am just as I amBut consciousness is different. It appears to have no form at all, because anything that would give it form must arise within the field of consciousness.In fact, we can directly experience that consciousness is never improved or harmed by what it knows.

If you find religious spirituality illusional, that doesnt mean spirituality doesnt exist. Alot of people think that with the progress of science religion dies, thus spirituality must also die. But once you realize what is spirituality and its independence of a religion or personal god, you will realize that its necessary for a better understaing of existence and science. We often think we are a one. we think our body and mind are both unified under a soul. And we think we have 1 soul. But, Sam harris amazingly rejects the idea of having a soul by presenting the (split brain experiment) in which the 2 hemispheres of the brain start behaving independently and unlikely of each other. It is like a person has 2 souls, because everything related to the human thought, brain, behavior...... gets non-unified while it is still the same body. And this really makes the idea of having a spirit/soul really doubtful. You will better ubderstand the split brain experiment as you read the book.Sam Harris thinks the spirit can mean consiousness, thus spirituality can mean contemplating at consciousness. Consciousness is not yet defined, but it can be contemplated and felt. Our joys are temporary. We get happiest only for a few days, then everything gets back to its ordinary track. Our joys are external and they depend on our friends, environment, job, money, achievements, or winning competitions of life. But can we find joy internally? can we still get happy without the need of the externall world? These are questions that spirituality seeks.Sam harris finds Buddhist meditation one of the most effective ways to understand consciousness/spirituality. Unlike most of the other religions, Buddhism is not concerned with threatening people with hell, or telling people what to do, feel, or think. This feature gives Buddhism- as a philosophy, not religion - the privilege to be the most effective and peaceful path for understanding spirituality. Sam harris also talks about the illusion of near death experience, and how NDE may occur in the brain according to neuroscience.The book is not so easy to read. talking and writing about spirituality is not an easy task. The book does not still give full answers to spirituality - which makes 3 stars suitable for this book, but it is still worth 4 stars for that it cant be better for now."
31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51526040-dimebag,Rating 5 out of 5,"The here and now…A prestigious art gallery happens to be on fire and the ravenous flames lick whatever comes in their path, and luckily you have been presented with an opportunity to rescue one important artwork from that torched building, instead, you chose to haul a chair out of that conflagrating art gallery.Unfortunately, most of us live our lives thinking—seemingly interminable rumination of the past that is an echo, an image basically, or planning for the future which hasn’t even arrived yet and there’s nothing wrong in planning for the future of course but this habit of living for the future is pernicious as it robs the present moment of its reality—and the irony is we don’t know that we’re thinking. Sooner or later, the inescapable ravages of time plunder our youth. To be truly free and be aware of the present moment is a skill and luckily, we all possess it, however, most of us are totally unaware of this mysterious key that can potentially unlock our minds to experience the total freedom our minds readily offer us—virtually at every moment.MindfulnessMindfulness meditation is a technique bequeathed to us by some of the greatest meditation practitioners the earth has ever seen. It’s a simple technique that helps us be aware of the present and experience the raw sensations the body—and the universe in general—has to offer. The goal of mindfulness is not to cure anxiety, depression, and the like—however one gets to have these mental health issues resolved by practicing this meditation technique—but to truly feel the present moment and enjoy it non-judgmentally. It doesn’t really matter if you’re in a crisis feeling dejected or sitting in a yogic posture on a mountaintop with an embracing horizon in your view, the objective is to observe the nature of the mind, to feel the moment, to seize the moment essentially, and find the inestimable equanimity within oneself. Mindfulness meditation technique truly helps alleviate suffering and helps us lead much better lives—as a matter of experience. Furthermore, mindfulness is totally a secular approach to spirituality and doesn’t come with any religious baggage or obligations, so it’s accessible to all human beings.ConsciousnessConsciousness is arguably the most important thing in the universe as everything we experience is by the virtue of consciousness and its contents, and the moment we discount consciousness there is nothing to which we can give our attention or be mindful about. For better or for worse we don’t know much about this enigmatic phenomenon—the jury is still out tho’. Sam defines it as 
“an experiential internal qualitative dimension to any physical system.”
 Furthermore, below is his elaborative definition:Consciousness is all we have, it’s what we are as a matter of experience, it’s what makes the people we love worth loving, and it’s what makes our failures to love so tragic, it’s what puts the string in every missed opportunity, it’s the substance of every joy and every sorrow, it’s the wind that blows toward wisdom or toward madness. And whatever your state of health, consciousness is the ultimate boundary between life and death, notice this bright circumstance in which everything is appearing all by itself, this is it! The real treasure of existence is already in your hand.EmotionsIt’s stunning when we sit back and observe the elusiveness and half-life of every emotion we ever experience: anger, anxiety, happiness, sadness, etc. These emotions arise out of consciousness willy-nilly and by definition we have no control over them however we do possess the knack—innate in us—to merely observe them taking birth—out of nowhere—and dying out—without a residue—and the ultimate irony is we can’t locate the genesis or sepulcher of these emotions—the whole lifecycle of these emotions is so ephemeral that it leaves us dumbfounded when we gaze at them, to say the least. So, breaking the spell of the narration we perpetually narrate to ourselves—when we’re left alone or amidst a conglomeration of people who are doing the same thing as we are every waking moment of their lives—is a skill and to realize that we broke the spell is a crowning achievement worthy of recognition, truly—however when we’re asleep this spell might seem broken as the laws of physics themselves cease to exist, allegedly. Most often than not the stories we’re telling ourselves often have protagonists struggling to get on with something or solving a riddle or debating something with someone—who’s not even present in our minds—or thinking of the past and regretting having done or said otherwise is a monumental waste of time, and to recognize this state of mind is crucial and once recognized proceeding to change the state of the mind—the mind is so easily malleable as a matter of experience; consider this: say you’re in a bad mood and the phone rings, and you’re being told by your employer that you’re getting a good raise this year or promotion even (BTW when promoted the pay grade increases by definition, so a win-win basically), and imagine how your state of mind alters—is totally possible. Once we are accustomed to observing the nature of our minds we can truly switch to happy-state-of-mind voluntarily just on a whim and can always deter ourselves from choosing miserable states of mind with a simple “no, thank you!” and not at all feel uneasy about it on the contrary feel proud about the choice we just made at no cost at all save time.SpiritualityHow often do we see the word spirituality entangled with religion? I would argue, habitually. Etymologically speaking, the word spirit comes from the Latin spiritus, which is a translation of the Greek pneuma, meaning ""breath"". Somehow religion patented this word and associated the term with ghosts, supernatural beings, etc. and as a result, it often discourages scientists and skeptics alike to pursue anything in this realm, which is quite unfortunate, but in their defense, it makes sense not to believe in anything that's contaminated by medieval superstition. However, it is totally possible to be spiritual without religion nevertheless it will be met with some skepticism by skeptics or be ignored by the same lot and sometimes met with some scorn by the pugnacious types—oh BTW I was one of them back in the day.Well-beingHuman well-being  entirely depends on events in the world and on states of the human brain. So it’s crucial we humans must take it seriously to have healthy minds free of suffering or the ability to alleviate mental suffering with relative ease—most of us can do it.ConclusionIt is totally possible that we can truly swim in this vast ocean of equanimity and enjoy every swim stroke while we’re at it. So, waking up from that dream and grabbing that key to unlock our minds and seizing every day of our lives—arguably every moment even—is the objective of this book Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion by Sam Harris.Carpe diem, folks! 😉"
32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10407443-ross-blocher,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sam Harris excels at jumping into contentious and weighty topics with sound logic, clear explanations, and a good deal of humor. He's one of those authors who, even if you disagree with, should be taken seriously. He has written other challenging treatments on religion, morality, free will, and lying.In Waking Up, Harris is promoting spirituality without religion. The book is assured to upset religious sensibilities for obvious reasons, but Harris has already walked that road before. This time he'll likely annoy many atheists and skeptics as well, for having the gall to promote spiritual practice. Harris is careful to define the term. He's talking about the contemplative, introspective tradition of looking within to examine the source of one's thoughts and the nature of the ""self"" (which turns out to be illusory). He's asking us to stop and examine the flood of thoughts that chatter incessantly within our minds and control so much of our daily experience. The word ""spirituality"" is used simply because there's no better term for the practice, and he'd rather not pretentiously coin a new one. Harris assures us, however, that no faith need apply.After setting these ground rules and introducing the problem of consciousness (Where does it come from? Who is the thinker of these thoughts?), Harris looks at various scientific attempts to describe the nature of consciousness (that 2nd chapter slowed me down considerably), and some parameters we can draw from what is known about the brain's functioning. Ultimately, consciousness defies external attempts to measure or describe, and Harris recommends observing it from within. While this internal pursuit does not match all the criteria of science, it is not antithetical to science, and is simply the only tool we have to explore these internal realms.Harris spends a good deal of time looking at the contemplative traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism, and describes many of his own teachers (as well as famous frauds as an example of what to look out for). For someone unfamiliar with these traditions (namely: me), there are a lot of new concepts and terms to encounter, and can only wonder how the young Sam Harris was able to take so many extended vacations jet-setting around the world. He also looks at psychadelic drugs and explores their effects, both good and bad. Harris is uniquely qualified to write this book, as someone who has spent numerous years in meditative study, has experimented with mind-altering drugs, and happens to be a neuroscientist.The chief revelation of the spiritual pursuit is that there is no ""I"" that is separate from our thoughts, no homunculus sitting in the control seat of the mind or calling the shots. Nor is there an immutable self that does not change over time. The temptation for many who consider these facts is to say, ""So what?"" Harris cites many potential advantages to the life examined, among them a greater ability to observe thoughts and emotions and not be ruled by them.The first chapter of the book is available to read (or hear) for free on Sam Harris's website: http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/ch..."

34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3961732-ron,Rating 2 out of 5,"Expecting a self-help handbook on meditation, I was surprised to discover that Harris has a different agenda in this book. The opening chapters are thick with reports of scientific research on the subject of consciousness. Not surprisingly, he finds that there is little known about consciousness beyond our subjective experience of it. We don’t know how or when it first appeared in human evolution, what purpose it is meant to serve, or where it is located in the brain.An avowed atheist, Harris’ preference at every turn is for rationality, and he expresses an overt distaste for anything that smacks of religious faith. His overall mission is to discredit any notion of the self, which he argues is an illusion, no more than the random flow of commentary that drifts through consciousness. No self means no soul, and no soul means no existence outside the body or in any state commonly spoken of as life after death. He even takes the time to dismiss near death experiences.Used to thinking of the voice in a book as that of the writer, and that writers have selves, I began to wonder who this selfless writer named Sam Harris is. If what I’m reading comes from a random flow of thought that has no reality, what am I supposed to make of it? What makes it rational? What prevents it from being nonsense?For me the weakest part of the book is the final section where he recounts his experiences under the influence of hallucinogens during his years as a young adult. As a shortcut to enlightenment, they sound jim dandy, but he readily admits that meditation is a slow road to enlightenment (the “waking up” of the title), which he has discovered in his own efforts over years of practice, including lengthy retreats with Buddhist masters. Sorry I bought this book."

This one I read a while ago, and now I think a review is due. Though I don't like Harris, I admit that this is a good book.Harris is a notable atheist, one of the 'four horsemen of new atheism'. Unlike this fellow comrades, he was very much interested in spirituality since his adolescence, when he experimented with spiritual drugs. This book is the outcome of his spiritual enquiry in India and various spiritual cultures. Sam Harris tries to maintain his agnostic attitude towards spirituality while experimenting with multifarious spiritual exercises. In the end, he turns out to be a proponent of spirituality. The crux of the book is the message that you don't have to be adherent of no particular religious belief system to have a spiritual experience. You can be an atheist, have scientific mindset, and be spiritual. Like the historical Buddha said, 'Belief nothing, no matter who said it, even if I said it, unless you know it to be true by yourself'. If you are a atheist or agnostic and want to explore spirituality from a secular viewpoint, this would be a good start for you. After all, irrespective of our believes, human being is a spiritual animal, we all have transcendental experiences from time to time. Spirituality shouldn't be confined within some religious institutions. "

 Most people who believe they are meditating are just thinking with their eyes closed.
 Forces of digestion and metabolism are at work within me that are utterly beyond my perception or control. Most of my internal organs may as well not exist for all I know of them directly, and yet I can be reasonably certain that I have them, arranged much as any medical textbook would suggest. The taste of the coffee, my satisfaction at its flavor, the feeling of the warm cup in my hand—while these are immediate facts with which I am acquainted, they reach back into a dark wilderness of facts that I will never come to know.... Where am I, that I have such a poor view of things? And what sort of thing am I that both my outside and my inside are so obscure? ...Am I inside my skull? Let’s say yes for the moment, because we are quickly running out of places to look for me. Where inside my skull might I be? And if I’m up there in my head, how is the rest of me me? Surprisingly humble and sincere. Some readers feel tricked - feel that Harris is smuggling in science under soft, false pretences. This isn't fair; he has done this stuff for decades, visited lamas in Tibet, put in the work. It's implausible that he would do so much insincerely; whatever his other failings, he is actually trying to bridge the two kinds of seekers.* (That said, this book design is a masterpiece of camouflage. Look at the soft colours, the sunny logo, the sans-serif purity, the unthreatening subtitle. Compare his other books!)However: consider all the things people mean by ""spirituality"":1. subjective knowledge of ultimate / immaterial reality1b. gaining supernatural abilities as a result2. one's deep moral or existential values3. personal growth4. feeling of awe-inspiring beauty5. introspection; close contact with one's own ""inner dimension""6. ""the ability to step a little back from your emotions and thoughts, observe them as they are without getting swept up in them, and then evaluating them critically""7. sense of love towards (all) others8. the quest to see the ego and the self as illusoryWith so much popular support - with so much baggage - it's not possible to throw out the word or concept; instead we have to try and reform it. This is Harris' mission - though in fact he focusses almost exclusively on (5) -> (8), the standard Buddhist therapy of not being hurt by distraction, bad luck, frustrated desires. He rejects (1) straightforwardly, in favour of psychologising the whole practice. Paraphrased: 'Instead of making you experience Reality, meditation lets you experience your mind; instead of strengthening your insubstantial soul, you're strengthening your mind.' This is a healthy kind of reconstruction in my view, but it certainly leads him to make controversial claims like ""The deepest goal of spirituality is freedom from the illusion of the self"". Metaphysically profligate readers will have no fun here. (But they knew that already.)How can a scientist (or at least a pro-science talking head) boost a practice with the aim of rejecting thought? The trick is to distinguish thinking / experiencing (which are after all the locus of all value, and of decisions and creativity) from identifying with the stream of your thoughts, from being carried away, from being endlessly distracted. ---Does this stuff work? It probably does for stress reduction - at least like taking a nap does, or a valium, or sitting still and breathing deeply for a bit. And on the other end, it is definitely not the source of supernatural brain-juice-drinking power. So the truth is somewhere between these two limits, and we drift, deciding whether to spend time on it.I'm an unpromising practitioner. For instance, this is kind of my jam. It's not the indescribability that bothers me - after all, any knowledge-how is indescribable (or rather describable only with millions of parameters). You can accept e.g. Hume or Parfit's reasoning - you can have the propositional knowledge, can know that ""there is no self beyond my bundle of experiences"". Meditation is supposed to be the know-how of nonessentialism, the skill of actually paying attention to the implications of this System-2 judgment.But being 'nonconceptual' means no language, no premises, no reason, no jokes, no connection, no comparison, using none of my strengths, leaving none of my spoor. This is a great loss to me.I don't know that I do suffer as a result of identifying with my thoughts; I don't think that dissatisfaction lurks in every sensation I ever experience or also my whole life in retrospect. But the old claim, similar to Marxist or feminist 'false consciousness', is that I am too owned to realise I'm being owned:
""beginning meditators... report after days or weeks of intensive practice that their attention is carried away by thought every few seconds. This is actually progress. It takes a certain degree of concentration to even notice how distracted you are.""
Freedom from desire sounds much like death to me, for all that Harris and others argue that it can somehow coexist with passion against the suffering of others, with striving to be a better person, with chipping in to the Great Project of discovery, compassion, optimisation. Luckily the two projects - really feeling that you are not your thoughts, not a homunculus behind your eyes having them; vs not wanting things because wanting leads to disappointment - seem to be separable.A consolation: there's a sense in which meditation, introspection and phenomenology are highly, maximally empirical - they involve very close attention and analysis of the raw data. It just happens that the raw data (the sense-data) are irreplicable, private, closed, and so not directly a matter for science. Empiricism before science, consciousness without self. And I like this. Mindfulness is billed as not just cool and true but useful - 
 No doubt many distinct mechanisms are involved - the regulation of attention and behaviour, increased body awareness, inhibition of negative emotions, reframing of experience, changes in your view of the 'self', and so forth - and each of these will have their own neurophysiological basis.""
Well, I do love self-regulation!The following argument isn't explicitly stated by Harris, but I find it helpful as an existence-proof for the usefulness of nonessentialism:1. We are happy and perform well when we're in 'flow' states.2. Flow states involve ""losing"" yourself in a task, in a concrete, unhesitating sequence of perceptions and actions.3. Therefore losing yourself can be good and helpful.Also1. We do not directly apprehend the external world; we know it through sense-data plus massive computational modelling tricks in the brain.2. We know that the brain computes the wrong thing sometimes. (Cognitive biases, optical illusions, top-down processing, hallucinations.)3. So, if such a thing is possible, it could be helpful to attend to sense-data more closely, to rule out automatic-brain errors.While I don't have a very clear philosophy of mind, I know I'm not a direct realist or substance dualist or identity essentialist, so I've no simple philosophical objections to breaking down the Self, either. Allons-y.---Even if I accept that mindfulness is a source of value, there's presumably still a tradeoff against clearer, quicker, more public sources: doing science or kindnesses or pleasures. 10 days spent in myself is 10 days not learning, not exercising, not enjoying, not helping, not meeting, in solitary. (And even on the contemplative axis it competes with Stoicism, with yoga, with writing, with psychedelics.)How much work will it be? Some contemplatives freely admit that the cost is very high: some contemplatives are not just salesmen. I met someone who claimed to be capital-e-enlightened. (He was otherwise articulate and modest.) He said it took 6 years' work, at many hours a week. I asked him if he could say how valuable it is in other terms - 'What else has been as good?' He said: a decade of intense psychotherapy, or two philosophy degrees. (One ancient text teases us by setting 'seven years' as the required period, but in true troll-Buddhist style it then slowly walks back this helpful definite statement.)---On that note: I was looking forward to writing a gotcha paradox here, but Harris (and thousands of years of arhats and yogis) pre-empted me:
...the deepest goal of spirituality is freedom from the illusion of the self -[but] to seek such freedom, as though it were a future state to be attained through effort, is to reinforce the chains of one's apparent bondage in each moment.One [solution] is to simply ignore the paradox and adopt various techniques of meditation in the hope that a breakthrough will occur. Some people appear to succeed at this, but many fail... Goal-oriented modes of practice have the virtue of being easily taught, because a person can begin them without having had any fundamental insight......The other traditional response is... to concede that all efforts are doomed, because the urge to attain self-transcedence or any other mystical experience is a symptom of the very disease we want to cure. There is nothing to do but give up the search.
I'm not actually worried by this, because I suspect the full-Buddhist anti-striving thing is unnecessary and... undesirable.---Why should an evolved creature have the power to inspect its own sense-data? If we are constantly distracting ourselves with reified thoughts, what evolutionary role did this play? At the top of this review is Harris' droll diss about people deluding themselves into thinking they are meditating - but how can we know that we, or anyone, is not deluded? (Brain scans of inhibited medial PFCs are interesting but merely suggestive.)---Most of the above isn't directly from Harris, I'm riffing off better rationalist reconstructions of this ancient one-weird-trick. (I actually don't know if this is any good, cos I don't know the area. Seems fine.)* Much of their anger is about his chapter warning of the history of abuse by gurus and yogis and so on. But like it or not this is a public service."
39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10274238-anthony,Rating 1 out of 5,"The first part of the book was about meditation techniques and mindfulness which was kind of interesting but is described in many other books. In typical Harris style this is presented as a fresh insight. From my experience the best way to begin meditating is to: - Feel love for everyone and everything around you- Consider the universe to be fixed and unchangeable - Stop identifying with your thoughts The first is not profound I think, I've never considered 'negative' thoughts to be bad. I'm very much against positive thinking for instance. The trouble is that negative thoughts get us physically ready to fight someone (involving adrenaline I'd imagine), which happens to be bad for our long term health (but good for our short term survival in violent situations) and gets in the way of clear thinking. I think this is the case even if we're thinking about how terrible ISIS is or complaining about Left wingers/Right wingers. This is just a coincidence and not proof that universal love is somehow part of some objective morality (Not that he said that). The second is related to the first. If we stop thinking we can change things, and just consider 'the world is full of suffering people and injustice' as an interesting fact. Then we will calm down and feel good and be able to focus on the small things we can change. It's very frustrating to focus on things we haven't the power to change, this gives rise to anger. I'm not saying this is a good way to think about the world, it's a terrible thing actually. One of the things I love about Christianity for instance is its passion for changing the world, Mindfulness is opposed to passion, mindfulness is death. Slavoj Žižek has created a great youtube series where he criticizes Buddhism, 'inner peace' does not necessarily go along with good deeds. The third part is just an attitude. Think of your brain as a thing which creates thoughts randomly, you choose and experience but you do not create the thoughts. This perspective makes us feel nice for some reason. I must admit, it's a good way of looking at things. All three combine to induce a brain state where we feel good and at peace with the universe, mostly because we're not preparing ourselves to fight someone I'd imagine. I'm not saying you shouldn't do it, but I don't consider it to be particularly profound (Not that I haven't been amazed in the past). Harris goes on and on about the self being an illusion, he never really explains what this means. After not defining the statement, he provides poor arguments in support.  There is no region of the brain that can be the seat of a soul.  Saying that the 'self' is an illusion because it cannot be located in a single part of the brain is like saying the operating system is an illusion because it can't be located in a single part of the hard drive. There's a thing which runs on my brain like a piece of software which feels and experiences, that thing is me, possibly not the only conscious agent within my brain and certainly not the only process. I feel therefore I am. You might think that thing is a only a small part of me, this is a language issue nothing more. Harris is no philosopher of science, for instance he states  Isaac Newton, squandered a considerable portion of his genius on the study of theology, biblical prophecy and alchemy . Personally, I think the only difference between a scientific theory and one which involves magic is whether or not it's true. Magic is by definition non existent, therefore things like biblical prophecy and alchemy can't be dismissed a priori. How can one expect people in the middle ages to know that gold can't be made chemically? We learn through trial and error, alchemy is certainly error but we only know because we tried. Perhaps we'll find that a HIV vaccine is impossible, would that make all the work quackery? Similarly a universe with God is not inconceivable, scientists today speak of evidence trumping scripture but there are conceivable universes where scripture would be more useful than observation i.e. within a computer game, one reads the manual. Obviously we know observation beats scripture now, not so obvious back then. People felt that reading ancient texts was the way to acquire knowledge. Harris loves the word empirical as well as the usual adjectives people overuse like scientific. For instance However, the empirical difference between the central teachings of Buddhism and Advaita and those of Western Monotheism is difficult to overstate. Whatever that means. Precise sounding verbiage. We have seen that the sense of self is logically and empirically distinct from many other features of the mind with which it is often conflated. As opposed to things which are empirically distinct but not logically distinct, perfectly clear. He also uses 'myself' as the object in non reflexive sentences. Fail. Sorry, that's just a pet hate of mine. The end of this book gets very weird. Harris shows himself in his youth to have been a credulous sycophant for a bunch of gurus, which is fine. One of my rules is to not criticize people for things that they freely admit to. The problem is, he doesn't even realise that he was a credulous sycophant. A woman from Switzerland became 'enlightened' in Poonja-ji's presence... seeing this woman sit beside Poonja-ji on a raised platform expounding upon how blissful it now was in her corner of the universe... Coming from such a nice, guileless person, there was little reason to doubt the profundity of her experience.Apparently Christians believe irrational things... The next guy was not his guru, but it's telling.  Consider the case of Tibetan lama Trungpa, who was  an inspired teacher  but also an occasionally violent drunk and philanderer... Trungpa asked a group of devotees to find the poets and bring them back to the party... The resulting forced entry led to chaos —wherein Merwin, who was then famous for his pacificism, fought off his attackers with a broken beer bottle, stabbing several in the fact and arms... He ordered his bodyguards to strip them... many of TRungpa's students viewed the assault on Merwin and Naone as a profound spiritual teachingmeant to subdue their egos  He finishes off with Near Death Experiences and the spiritual uses of pharmacology. Perhaps one star was a bit harsh, but I finished the book and thought to myself, 'What the hell was that?' "

For 2023, one of them is to better control/quiet my mind. I have been meditating on and off for many years. I used to use the Calm app, but I find the instructions cliched, just like some self-help books. True, they are not unhelpful, but I would not spend much time reading them. I never stuck to the meditation habit using the app.So even though I knew meditation might be what I needed, I was not convinced that restarting Calm app is a good idea. But some instructions are definitely needed for me.Then, almost by accident, on Jan 2nd, I checked Andrew Huberman's newly released podcast. It was an interview with Sam Harris. Honestly, just like many claims in the book, I did not fully understand what Sam Harris was saying. But maybe because of the way he said certain things, or maybe just his soothing voice, 10 minutes into the discussion, I was captivated by his theory and decided to try his app WakingUp.Now, about 1.5 month later, I think that meditating with WakingUp app might be one of the most important and best decision I made in 2023. Those 10 minutes of meditating and focusing on experiencing the breath, the sensation, and even thoughts and feelings, however briefly I can really focus or empty my thoughts, are a pleasure.Reading this book is just for me to get more imprint on his theories. Even though now there's a gap in my understanding, I feel someday I may solve the riddle."

Aposto que ele é um cara super gente boa fora dos livros. Tive sorte esse ano de ler autores que aparentam ser pessoas sensacionais, que eu realmente sinto vontade de ter como amigos. Pessoas que eu me espelho, pelo menos a ideia que tenho delas. Mas vamos lá...O livro que em seu título diz ser um guia espiritual, é bem pouco disso e mais um tipo de texto de discussão à cerca do que seria religiosidade e o mais importante, o que seria espiritualidade, tanto nos conceitos filosóficos quanto nos científicos disso. Demora bastante para engatar no discurso e isso me desagradou, pois parece que por várias páginas o autor fala a mesma coisa e no fim do capítulo termina com algo como ""e é sobre isso que essa obra se trata"", incomoda, mas dá pra passar. Depois de uns 20 ou 30% de leitura a coisa evolui positivamente de uma maneira fantástica, entrando em discussões sobre a consciência e, mais especificamente, na ideia do ""self"", o ""eu oculto"" que aparentemente habita dentro de cada um de nós. O autor foca quase o livro todo em mostrar que a ideia de self é errada e não existe tal coisa e isso é o que boa parte das doutrinas orientais de meditação tentam buscar. Então ele faz uma análise cética disso, enxugando para o leitor o que faz sentido cientificamente entregando assim, receitas de meditação e de ""destruição do self"". Li o livro todo e ainda a noção de um self me é muito forte, não consigo me desvencilhar totalmente dela.Esse livro também é um dos melhores guias sobre ""mindfullness"" ou ""atenção plena"", uma técnica de meditação que visa concentrar a atenção no momento presente, tentando esvaziar ao máximo sua mente. Ele mostra como há muitas evidências científicas que mostram os benefícios dessa prática, para a saúde, concentração, no sono, no tratamento de depressão, entre outras coisas. Eu fiz por algumas vezes e é bem difícil, mas notei alguns resultados bem satisfatórios e pretendo continuar praticando. Já havia lido sobre mindfullness em 2014 graças a um amigo e cheguei a conhecer bastante sobre o assunto na época, mas deixei de lado, agora me senti mais animado.Sam Harris tenta fazer uma obra que mostra que você é um agente ativo de si mesmo e que a forma como você interage e reage ao mundo pode sim ser uma escolha, embora isso exija muita prática e determinação. Um fato ocorrido em sua vida pode ser apenas ruim e gerando quase incômodo algum ou pode ser a causa de um ódio e estresse incríveis pra você, dependendo da forma como você enxerga e interage com esse fato. Isso é algo valiosíssimo de se aprender, a não se incomodar tanto ou então se incomodar na medida certa. E o melhor, tentar viver o agora, não no sentido ""carpe diem"" da coisa, mas sim, prestar atenção com o que está ocorrendo no presente, seja ruim ou bom, pois sempre estamos vivendo no passado ou no futuro, enquanto o presente de nada importa.Esse livro me mostrou coisas bem úteis, mas não foi um dos melhores que li em 2016 e o autor parece muito redundante em alguns pontos do livro, além de não se aprofundar em outros, por isso não dei cinco estrelas, embora, se pudesse, daria 4.5. Livro recomendadíssimo!"
43,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Well, it didn't surprise me to learn that Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens were buddies.Like Hitch, Sam is a fantastic writer and brilliant thinker who's no fan of religion. In this compelling book, he shares his views on spirituality and consciousness, discussing meditation as a means of achieving spirituality which is entirely independent of religious belief and ritual.Obviously, as a practicing religious person, Sam and I are not on the same page. I also struggled to understand his chapter on meditation; he lost me at several points which almost cost the book a star. And I was hoping he would discuss the connection between temporal lobe stimulation and transcendent spiritual experiences; something I heard about briefly once and would love to know more about.That being said, this was a provocative and enjoyable book which was worth reading (although it demands focus). As a psychologist, much of his information about our power to influence the way we think and the impact this has on our experiences was highly relevant to the work that I do. I especially enjoyed his chapter on religious gurus, where he brilliantly articulated the dynamic that frequently takes place between religious leaders and idealizing sycophants. Overall, my religious beliefs and practices notwithstanding, I think it's fascinating to contemplate what spirituality means and whether true spirituality can exist independent of religion. Sam's views, though different from my own, are impressively expressed and worth contemplating."

So much of what makes Sam Harris Great is his rationality and critical thinking. This book does little of that. About the first eight of the book I was like Oh My gosh he is totally onto something this book is going to be amazing. Then it just lost ist focus and seemed to lose its backing. Sam you took on something that was going to be a difficult topic from the outset but you changed your style significantly. This has upset your regular audience, then on top of that you picked something that is likely to not sit well with the true spirituals either. I think you missed the audience mark on this one and also you missed out on some serious rational backing. "

46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2422229-joe-kraus,Rating 3 out of 5,"Review of Sam Harris’s Waking UpThis book wasn’t written for me, but it is awfully interesting, and I respect it for the influence it’s had on some people I really respect. (Shout out to my brother Ed!)To begin with, I’m frustrated by the frame of Harris’s project. As his subtitle suggests – “A Guide to Spirituality without Religion” – he’s trying to justify his interest in spirituality to an audience inclined to be skeptical of it. I get the impression that his ideal audience for this part of the book is the late Christopher Hitchens, whom Harris acknowledges as a friend and influence. If you are an avowed atheist, as Harris and Hitchens are, then you no doubt look on most interrogations of the spiritual as intrinsically flawed. If you insist always on logic and reason, then there’s a lot to be suspicious about when someone starts talking about consciousness and the illusion of the self.In his first chapter or so, Harris rehearses a quick set of reasons to dismiss traditional religion entirely. As he sees it, it’s a series of “myths, superstitions, and taboos,” a set of harmfully distracting fairy tales. As he makes that case, though, he relies on a lot of assumptions among his target audience. Hitchens would no doubt nod in agreement with such a phrase, but what about the rest of us? (It doesn’t help, by the way, that Harris seems to have little understanding of the crucial and nuanced ways in which Judaism is different from the other Abrahamic traditions he speaks about. For that matter, I suspect he’s mistaken about Islam and its Sufi traditions as well as Christianity and many of its esoteric strains.)There’s no reason for me to rehearse the argument here – in brief, I’d argue that Harris conflates what I think of as a crisis of literalism, the misapprehension by contemporary “faithful” of texts that previous generations understood more poetically, with what we’d both agree is something like idolatry. But I’d argue as well that there’s no reason Harris needs to rehearse this argument here either. He frames his thoughtful discussion of spirituality and meditative practice with this quick, and in many ways condescending, overview. It’s like a devotee of Picasso and Matisse trying to explain why there might be something worth valuing in a comic book, or a classically trained dancer explaining why we should pay attention to hip-hop dance. Those metaphors fail, though, because there are thoughtful “highbrow” thinkers who find a way to value both types of art. Harris seems to feel he has to start from the sense of religion as flawed and harmful before he can try to extract elements of value from it.All that’s just the frame, though. The main thrust of Harris’s book is a thoughtful take on what spirituality is and how we might come to study it through the tools of self-reflection and meditation. Starting from his background as a neuroscientist, one who has spent much of his life trying to learn from practitioners of meditation across the world, he bolsters his description of what it means to meditate with what’s taking place inside the brain. (There remains a trace here of what I call the “error of his frame.” It’s as if he’s trying to tell the Hitchens of the world that – don’t worry, bro’ – there’s still a lot of science behind the soft sounding stuff.)As I read all this, I am intrigued by what it would be like to be a successful meditator, and I am led to think more carefully about reports from a couple good friends who say that regular meditation has improved the quality of their lives. That part of this book strikes me as meaningful, and I’m not sure anyone else could have written it – certainly no one else I’m aware of.And, if it feels like I might be quibbling with what I call the “frame,” I find myself resisting the thrust of this part on a more thoughtful level.The fact is, I’m a bad meditator. I enjoy yoga, but I have learned it’s agonizing for me to do it without a sense of how time is passing. (In fact, I have to sneak a watch in with me. So long as I know where I am in the hour, I can relax. When I lose sight of that, I feel a vague panic that time might have stopped. It’s “against the rules,” but I enjoy the experience only when I am hyper-conscious of time rather than lost within it.)And, while I acknowledge the value of others’ experience, I don’t apologize for my own resistance. Good for others – and I mean that without condescension or sarcasm – if they can find strength and calm in discovering that the self is an illusion. I find comfort in the idea that I’m called always to better my “self,” however illusory that notion may be. I respect traditions that push toward a sense of the self as quantum, but I also respect the Western philosophical tradition founded on Socrates’s challenge to “know thyself.” When I write in the essay tradition of Montaigne, I understand myself as limning my own self, my own experience, and I value the experience of encountering others attempting the same thing. In that light, I think of Kurt Vonnegut, who was famously hostile to meditation and its practices (supposedly because his first wife got “lost” in such experience as he saw it). Instead, Vonnegut insisted that there was a “Western” practice of meditation. It was, he said, called reading, and he understood it as the experience of discovering (as opposed to losing) a sense of self through its similarities and contrasts with others.I’m not dismissing what Harris is arguing here, and I don’t want to do him the disservice of casting his arguments as absolute. While he focuses here on the power of meditation, he’s also clearly spent much of his life pursuing science and other forms of intellectual inquiry. Still, I can’t help but put the end-frame on my own take on his work:I have heard a number of times, but most movingly at my nephew’s bar mitzvah, the story of a rabbi who used to insist that we carry notes in our left and right pockets. On one he’d write, “I am the center of the universe.” On the other, “I am meaningless before the divine.” The idea was to strike a balance between a sense of self as all-encompassing and a sense of it as, to steal from the traditions Harris valorizes, illusory. It was also, I like to think, an effort to strike a balance between means of inquiry. It takes doubt – a doubt that Harris admirably uses through his application of science and reason to these questions – but I believe as well that it takes faith – a kind of faith that I think Harris too readily disdains – to accept the other crucial half of our place within the world.I admire Harris for shining doubt on aspects of spirituality, for reclaiming them for the Hitchens of the world for whom they would otherwise be inaccessible. I also think he misses a big part of the picture in his seeming inability to look through the lens of faith at the same phenomena."
47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8311987-david,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book was truly frustrating to read. I read it with a friend to discuss, having read a few books and scholarly articles about mindfullness meditation prior to this, and was hoping that if anyone would be able to ‘demystify’ how meditation worked and why it has beneficial psychological and physiological impacts, it would be Sam Harris, a renowned Neurologist. I did not know how mistaken I would be.Before I go further into this book, I would like to suggest an alternative book for those looking for a better look at the mechanisms behind meditation and how it works so they can avoid this book if they haven’t already: Mindsight by Daniel Siegel (a psychiatrist by trade). You will be much better off from a standpoint of academia, understanding of what goes on in the brain, how emotions are regulated, overall brain function, as well as how multiple sciences interact to form a more cohesive picture of the brain and consciousness (as well as dysfunction) from his book. Regrettably, Sam Harris prefers to rely more on personal anecdote, arrogance, and hubris for his semi-scholarly walkabout through ‘spirituality,’ consciousness, New Atheism, Near Death Experiences, “Gurus,” how to find the ‘guru for you,’ psychedelics, Mormonism, Scientology, various ‘types of meditation which I rejects out of hand because they didn’t work for him personally so they didn’t warrant further personal anecdotes so I guess they aren’t empirically verifiable,’ Sam Harris’ twenties in Tibet... if you are wondering what a number of these topics are doing in a book about the ‘hard science’ and ‘empiricism’ of meditation, you aren’t alone, I was baffled at this. I can only assume that at this point in Harris’ career, he no longer thinks he needs an editor; Or, having seen the manuscript was only 200 pages, thought that they needed to pad this out so it would be more than an agonizingly long essay.Here is what I genuinely wanted, which I thought Harris could (and said!) he would deliver: meditation, in an empirical, hard scientific fashion. Meditation, without the magic. I wanted him to be able to explain how meditation works with the use of functional MRIs, some neurological equipment that perhaps a PhD prepared neurologist would have at their disposal. He failed, rather spectacularly, to deliver, at one point offering a comically cryptic quote on how deceptively ‘simple’ meditation is that would fit in any ‘B’ movie stereotype: “Imagine a teaching like this: If you just focus on the trees swaying outside the window without distraction, you will see your true face."" So, essentially, as a skeptic and rationalist, I still have no clear set of ‘guidelines’ to ‘know’ if I am meditating correctly. It is not truly ‘observable.’ I just have to ‘know’ that I am. That’s profoundly unhelpful to someone who grew up in a self-doubting, anxious, atheist household. I am programmed not to take anything on faith. You could, ironically, say that is how I was designed.The only redeemable chapter was the chapter on consciousness, which has been stated and cited better elsewhere, such as Dan Siegel’s book, mentioned earlier in this review.F—k you, Sam Harris. I wanted science. Also, the majority of your endnotes were less than worthless."

Maybe it was the misguided notion that came with the word “spirituality”, which I think many people hold. It is thought of as something like self-deception. Sam Harris bursts that misconception.Sam Harris, who is a neuroscientist, argues that the goal of spirituality is to get rid of the perception of “I”. The feeling of us being the thinker of thoughts. The phrase he uses to describe this feeling is we “being the passenger to the vehicle to the body”. We experience things from one side, almost like looking over our own shoulders, which makes us “define our point of view in every instant"". And this sense of awareness of self versus everything else around us is depriving us from having better experiences. Instead of being in this sphere of experience, we are always having a third person view, thinking that our head is the centre of experience. When closely examined, this sense of self can disappear and so does the idea of a permanent unchanging centre. He argues that mindfulness is not a matter of thinking more clearly, it is an act of experiencing more clearly. He advocates certain methods to accomplish that, one of them being through the practice of meditation. The first step in that direction, he says, is to realize that it is possible to have that experience with just a shift in paradigm.I liked this book because it addresses subjects like consciousness and spirituality from a very rational point of view, citing scientific examples along the way. I would recommend it."

Many passages in this book are quite ""meta"" so be prepared for some mind bending, but believe everyone can benefit from a little mind bending now and again. :) This is a short book to be savored and contemplated. While it's certainly not as life-changing as The God Delusion or The End of Faith, it give you some interesting food for thought. Harris definitely poses some realities of ""consciousness"" I have never before considered and I will likely return to time and time again. There is also an interesting section where he debunks the ""science"" behind the runaway best seller Proof of Heaven which I quite enjoyed, as well as a section on how psychedelics can afford a view of the inner conscious landscape like nothing else can. Quite enlightening. "

Waking Up starts out well enough, describing some interesting neurological research about the brain and the perception of self, but it quickly turned into a frustrating slog to me. Harris quickly zeroes in on his one grand unifying theory of spirituality: realize that there is no ""self"" (through meditation or maybe psychedelic drugs) and you shall be enlightened. Here's an example of Harris's writing which transported me back to the worst parts of grad school: ""The self that does not survive scrutiny is the subject of experience in each present moment - the feeling of being a thinker of thoughts inside one's head, the sense of being an owner or inhabitant of a physical body, which this false self seems to appropriate as a kind of vehicle. Even if you don't believe such a homunculus exists - perhaps because you believe, on the basis of science, that you are identical to your body and brain rather than a ghostly resident therein - you almost certainly feel like an internal self in almost every waking moment. And yet, however one looks for it, this self is nowhere to be found. It cannot be seen amid the particulars of experience, and it cannot be seen when experience itself is viewed as a totality. However, its absence can be found - and when it is, the feeling of being a self disappears.""Ugh. I understand that we are talking about a fairly deep subject, but I was under the impression that Harris was trying to make these ideas accessible to a wider audience. I don't think he succeeded here. A significant part of the book is devoted to Harris describing his own experiences bumming around Asia studying with one guru or another. I get that Harris would argue that he's producing his pedigree of who he's studied with so as to establish some expertise, but it comes off as insufferable name-dropping. I really tried to be open-minded as he described his experiences with months-long meditation retreats, but I couldn't help but roll my eyes picturing him and other Westerners exoticizing Eastern religions and practices while picturing how much more enlightened than they would be than their friends that went backpacking in Europe instead. One of the last chapters is a mishmash that deals with the abuses that are rampant in guru-devotee relationship as well as a discussion of psychedelic drugs and their use in promoting this goal of cessation of self (oh, sorry, I meant ""self""). These topics seem oddly disjointed and don't seem to follow very well with the organization of the book. This was the part of the book where I began to suspect I was reading a bunch of blog posts strung together. While I found the descriptions of the abuses of people at the hands of gurus and Buddhist teachers disturbing, I was not sure what Harris was trying to get at here. Were these cautionary tales? Proof that Harris could be as critical of hypocritical Eastern teachers as exploitative Western religious leaders? It wasn't clear and seemed awkwardly tacked on.By the time Harris started in on jump-starting your enlightenment with psychedelic drugs, I knew to brace myself. Harris gave a lot of anecdotes from his own experiences, which were apparently mostly good experiences for him, despite one experience that involved a rowboat, Esperanto and Nepalese soldiers (I hate it when that happens!). I was skeptical of his advice that taking these kinds of drugs would lead to break-throughs for people, considering the vast majority of people I know who have gone on drug trips have come back with less mind-blowing insights like ""wearing pants is dumb"" and ""Guys! Our bodies are made of tubes!"". On the bad trip side, I have seen more than a few people in drug-induced psychotic states succumb to frightening religious delusions based on all the scariest stuff from Christianity, which is something I believe Harris would frown upon. By the time I got to the conclusion of Waking Up, I was frustrated and annoyed to realize that Harris's grand unifying theory of selflessness was not the accessible spirituality that I had been hoping for. There was almost nothing in Waking Up that addresses, for example, how to practically embody your new spirituality in the world. How does an enlightened person act towards others in the world? This is only vaguely alluded to. If self is an illusion, what does that mean for our day to day lives? Beats me. Maybe you can read Waking Up and let me know if you figure it out, but I wouldn't recommend it. "

This often is a quick way to get people laughing or rolling with their eyes in groups of atheists and anti-theists. Unfairly so, I would say. It's important that many of us who don't believe in personal God(s), divine entities or supernatural phenomena reclaim the term ""spiritual"" and spiritual experience. To stop seeing spirituality as incompatible with a scientific outlook, especially as we progress to a world with more non-believers and people who are searching for robust and benevolent sources of meaning. Together we can create and develop, like Cognitive Science professor John Vervaeke calls it in his wonderful ""Awakening from The Meaning Crisis"" series, an ecology of spiritual practices within our growing secular communities. Communities which should, of course, also have plenty of room for Buddhists, Christians, Jews, Pantheists, Freethinkers, etc. It has the potential to bind us to each other, when science, philosophy, spiritual practice and meaning come together and enlighten us as individuals, and culturally as societies on our planet Earth.This book can be seen as part of that shared quest into the future.(Loved Sam's reading of the audiobook! Yay for the authors working on their own audiobooks.)"

I vacillated between finding what Harris wrote brilliant then not-so-amazing. I dare not say that any of it is stupid but while he did his darnedest to give himself scientific credibility by fervently denouncing religions, especially Western ones. As an agnostic, I initially appreciated his view but as the book wore on, to read about it repeatedly just made for boring parts to push through. Harris pointed out defiantly the negative aspects of Buddhism but also highlighted the ""rational"" and ""empirical"" ones.He really, really cheered for these the entire time. Then he talked about Chögyam Trungpa, who absolutely horrified me. And then I remembered why I am not a devout follower of ANYTHING. I think critically about most things and to try to salvage the good parts of something hideous is not a pill I can really swallow. Maybe I am still judgmental because I'm not so naïve as to believe that everything is either good or bad. This is far from the way we can classify people, the immensely complex beings that we are. The very beliefs that Harris is so passionate about and the people who are leaders of the institution are on such shaky grounds as to leave me extremely skeptical of their aims and teachings. Irrespective of my hang-ups with his weak arguments and faulty logic and analogies, there were gems that I picked up along the way. While I do not strive to be a yogi or guru or any kind of full-time meditator, as a general characteristic of mine, I like to contemplate and--gasp!--think about life, the world, the universe, my purpose, etc. I realize that I easily am consumed by my thoughts, which results in insomnia, and I can greatly benefit from the mental discipline of not allowing myself get lost in thinking and to just be present.Experiencing the world about us without much thinking could certainly save us all from a bit of suffering indeed."

To me, Sam Harris is still looking for answers about the universe but truly believes he has it figured out compared to others, referencing his arrogance. He still seems to heavily believe in the importance of gurus, referencing a difference between beliefs and conviction. He is too much of a relativist and subjectivist, consistently skirting around an objective moral reality, a robust question that could prove the existence of a God; if not an objective morality, what's the point of improving the self? And lastly, he uses too much Scientism, neurotically relying on science and current research to prove everything he believes, ironically this is what a religion is.The difference between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris is the difference between a Scientist and a Philosopher. Science answers the how, this is what Dr. Harris is doing and this is why he falls short because he is trying to answer a Why with a How. Dr. Peterson is answering a Why with a Why. Science answers the How and Philosophy answers the Why. If you ask me, be wary of this man. I do not believe he is immoral in the sense that he is maliciously leading people down the wrong path, I think he truly believes what he is saying. But, do not mistake someone spending a lot of time doing something for knowing what they're talking about. And do not mistake someone wanting to be rational using fluffy words for logical strings of thought, it might be incredibly irrational."
58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34442147-nuno-r,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sam Harris writes from his experience and to a place where there is certainly a void. Many people will relate to it. To grow, search for meaningful experiences, have an inner life, to do what scientists (or anyone) cannot do for us, is certainly something that many people still feel a need for. And and the same time not give up rational thinking or having to concede to a specific creed's rituals. It's not enough to listen to a specialist in fitness to be fit, we can rationally understand what the specialist says, but we still have to go through physicall training to get fit. With spirituality, with meditation it's the same thing, it is up to us, we still have to go through the process ourselves. It's not enough to understand the idea. The book is a very good contribution to something important. Everyone on the planet can benefit from spirituality. And if you think that religions have harmfull aspects, if, more than that, you are an atheist, than what is left for you, if it's religions that usually give people spiritual guidance? Well, here it is. Spirituality without religion. Sam Harris talks from a practical point of view. From the perspective of someone who has searched. This is not theology. It is a book about what someone searching for spirituality can do, what are the dificulties that person can expect, and it is an honest contribution to this area."

I still can not grasp what seems to be his main point - that the self is an illusion. Not sure if it's me being dense and so deeply immersed in my experience of my self - or if his attempt at explaining is inadequate. Clearly he is trying to communicate something - and I just cannot wrap my thoughts around it or get inside what he is saying. I experience reading the sentences as meaningless words - language unconnected to anything in my experience to which I can relate it. I am intrigued, but entirely baffled. He has a meditation app of the same name (Waking Up) which I will try to see if it helps me experience or connect to what he's trying to describe.Also, he is clearly pissed off at religion. Not just disagreeing with it as unscientific and irrational, but as a lie, a fraud, a harmful delusion, and deception. I do agree that some use religion deceive themselves and others, but I think for the majority it is a means of making sense of the world, an attempt to cope and provide a structure for living. Yes, great harm has been done in the name of religion - but good has also been created. He seems more intent on condemnation of religion than on understanding. I wonder what that is about."

What I found instead was a clear, thorough, sane, and compelling account of how and why we might engage in spiritual practice outside of any religious orthodoxy. This is not to suggest that Harris avoids all traditional wisdom, nor does he sloppily lump all religions together. To the contrary, he draws heavily on certain strains of Buddhist thought as well as Advaita Vedanta. He also offers an incisive critique of how certain specific religious doctrines can be harmful to human flourishing; however, that critique is not the main focus here. I gather that may be found in his other books. Highly recommended! "

So it probably comes down to writing for a lay audience, and then to a doctoral defense committee...

67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2436371-dennis-littrell,Rating 3 out of 5,"Essentially agreeable but not as good as “The End of Faith”I very much like the idea of spirituality without religion, especially without the church system, the guru system, the monastic system, or any other institution for maintaining the cannons of belief and tradition. I think the tenets of all religions can be maintained in sutras, bibles and other works of literature. The problem with religious institutions is they become primarily social and political organizations and inevitably stray from spirituality.So I began this book with enthusiasm and, because I had read and reviewed favorably one of Harris’ previous books, “The End of Faith: Religion, Terror and the Future of Reason” (2004), with high expectations as well. But I was a bit disappointed. Part of my disappointment stems from the fact that Harris and I disagree on some matters, and part of it comes from my belief that this book is not as well written or as well thought-out as “The End of Faith.”A good part of the book is about consciousness and the nature of the self. Harris is convinced that a tomato is not conscious. I tend to agree but I wonder if he realizes that the tomato plant itself is conscious. Again we have the problem, as with most authors on consciousness, that Harris does not actually define consciousness. He seems to think of consciousness as simply awareness and that is okay because awareness is most of what consciousness is all about. A tomato is aware of nothing (we presume) while a tomato plant can react to sunlight and being chewed upon by insects. For me “react to” is crucial here. All intelligence is directed to movement of some kind. Yet even that is not sufficient to distinguish between what is conscious and what is not. A person can be conscious, for example, and be so totally immobilized that only the barest reaction to stimuli is possible. So, as Harris says, consciousness is subjective. That being the case, we can never know for certain if something is conscious or not. A person locked in cannot prove that he is conscious although, thanks to advances in neurological instrumentation, that may change. His consciousness is private in a similar sense that the experience of going to other worlds, which many have claimed they have done, is private. Near death experiences are examples of what I call private truths. They are true to the person who experiences them but not necessarily to others. Consequently consciousness is ultimately a private experience and something we can talk about but not really understand any more than we can understand the universe beyond the Planck time or beyond the reach of our instruments. Consciousness is also an illusion. We are not conscious in the sense that we think we are. We are not fully aware of the outer world. We interact with that world through our senses, memory, ideas and body while our minds are constituted in such a way as to make us think we are aware. There is no “we” to begin with. So what is it that is conscious? My eyes take in light and process it so that the greater brain can inform the larger organism how to behave in light of what is seen and understood in concert with our instincts and experience. But there is no “we” or “I” being aware. The myth of the self is the problem here. (Harris calls it “The Riddle of the Self.”) We try to understand consciousness in the context of a continually existing self when no such self exists. The “I” the “you” the “we” are not isolated entities. All are part of a larger whole.Harris asks, how does consciousness emerge? A similar question is how does pain emerge? Pain has no existence outside of the neurological and physiological cooperation in the organism. For pain to exist it requires (1) a stimulus, say an injury to the body such as a cut, (2) a reception of that stimulus, the neurons involved in recognizing the injury, (3) a reaction from the neurological system that this is threatening or dangerous to the organism, and (4) an interpretation of all of this sent in a message to the conscious mind resulting in the experience of pain. Further this requires that the message (pain) be very disagreeable, or even intolerable to the organism.Harris writes:“…life is defined according to external criteria. Consciousness is not (and, I think, cannot be). We would never have occasion to say of something that does not eat, excrete, grow, or reproduce that it might be ‘alive.’ It might, however, be conscious.” (p. 59)And this is the crux of the matter. Consciousness is a private truth, forever by the very reality of a scientific truth, unprovable.Harris writes (p. 60): “Nothing about human behavior or language or culture demonstrates that it is mediated by consciousness, apart from the fact that we simply know that it is—a truth that someone can appreciate in himself directly and in others by analogy.”“We simply know.” Well, that is not good enough. One might say that we are separate selves existing over time. We simply know we are separate selves existing over time. No, we are not, and Harris says as much. Harris is asking us to believe an assertion that he (and of course, many, many others) make. We know the truth, thank you. Well, we don’t. That is not science and it is also poor philosophy. What should be said it that the self is an illusion we can’t help but believe.The question arises (in an endnote on page 221): why should … events in the brain be experienced at all? I presume Harris means conscious events. The answer is that experiencing such events is adaptive in a Darwinian sense. Most animals, we tend to believe, exist in the eternal now and have no sense of self in the past or the future. They are conscious of (aware of) events in the here and now and react to them usually in an appropriate adaptive manner. They run from danger and approach easy sources of food, etc. For most animals further awareness (“consciousness”) would be of little or no value, in fact, may even be detrimental to their survival just as “thinking too much” in the face of some dangers may be detrimental to our survival.In the chapter on “The Riddle of the Self” Harris recalls some experiments that he believes are relevant such as Derek Parfit’s thought experiment using teleportation (which incidentally was anticipated by the similar “Swamp Man” thought experiment by Donald Davidson in 1987, not to mention the similar thought experiment in my book, “The World Is Not as We Think It Is.” Harris’s conclusion is that this demonstrates that the self is “the continuity of memory” that we all harbor. I think that is true but I also think what this demonstrates is that identification with the self is like the candle flame: the same or nearly the same in everyone; and in fact is nothing more than an identification similar to the one we might feel for the home team (but usually much more powerful).I was not thrilled with Harris’s chapter on “Gurus, Death, Drugs, and other Puzzles.” I don’t know why he bothered. He spent entirely too much time debunking near death experiences. So many people have had them and they are so patently delusory that they have been debunked to death. (Pun intended.)Finally there is our different understanding of meditation. Harris is primarily coming from the Buddhist tradition where one observes one’s breath and believes that progress is made when one has insights. Insight meditation is a misnomer in my experience. I gain insights outside of meditation, perhaps following meditation or just in a day to day kind of way. In my experience and understanding meditation has nothing to do with insights or thoughts of any kind. It is a purely physical experience in which the key is to stop the incessant flow of thoughts. The method in yoga is to focus the mind on a single object or sound. I like to focus on my forehead or my stomach or on any of the chakras or simply on the void that one experiences with the eyes closed. The result of meditation is not insight into anything (although that could be a byproduct). Instead the result is bliss or sometimes pleasure or something utterly indescribable. Sometimes the result is nothing since it is not always possible to meditate. They say it comes by grace. And it may come at any time or not. It’s not likely to come when one is in pain or discomfort or distracted. --Dennis Littrell, author of “Yoga: Scared and Profane (Beyond Hatha Yoga)”"

I came in with high hopes, expecting content of a similar calibre to Harris' other work, especially in the Waking Up app itself. The subtitle seemed to confirm my suppositions, so I was slightly taken aback when what I got instead was a confusing mix of neuroscience, anecdotes, thought experiments, and semi-irrelevant critique of other works. Harris' prose is, as always, slick and analytical, but he fails to craft a solid idea or narrative throughout the book, instead making pitstops at various topics without any apparent reason. That sums up my biggest criticism of the book — it's a collection of interesting ideas and facts, all undoubtedly brilliantly executed, but lacking in cohesion. The more complex explanations had me lost more often than not, but it's precisely these ideas that could easily be summed up in one or two pages. It's not a popular science book, it's not a philosophy text, it's not a comprehensive meditation guide, and it's not accessible enough for the 'millions of Americans' it's marketed towards. Maybe I'll appreciate this book more if I come back to it in a few years' time, who knows. However, I can confidently say that Harris has sparked in me an interest to try psychedelics (for the spiritual insights, of course)."

72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15827877-hiram-crespo,Rating 4 out of 5,"I generally consider Sam Harris to be the right kind of intellectual for our generation, even if at times I do not agree with everything he says. The reason for this is that the subjects that he chooses to cover are relevant and important, and he takes the conversation on morality where it needs to go. He is standing on the shoulders of people like Nietzsche, Sartre, and other recent philosophers who demystified morality and sought a naturalist approach to it. Harris focuses on a scientific approach based on his neuroscience research and on his vast experience with contemplative practices, as they relate to therapeutic philosophy and to the cultivation of wellbeing.For all these reasons, Harris resonates deeply with the work of the Society of Friends of Epicurus, and in fact the chapter on meditation in my book Tending the Epicurean Garden was inspired, in part, by Harris’ assertion–in his piece Killing the Buddha–that we need a “science of contemplation”.Harris: a Secular BuddhistWaking Up is entirely committed to the Buddhist doctrine of anatta (no-self, no-soul): the theory that the self is imaginary and non-existent. Two first verses in the Dhammapada, the Gospel of Buddha, teach that all good and bad things are derived from mind. Harris says:Our minds are all we have.Your mind is the basis of everything you experience and of every contribution you make to the lives of others. Given this fact, it makes sense to train it.While reading this book, it became clear that Sam Harris is really a Buddhist, is committed to Buddhist doctrines–like the aforementioned teaching of no-self–and is teaching Buddhism. He also gives a nod to the Advaita school of Hindu philosophy, which he says is heavily influenced by Buddhism, and even elaborates on the four Noble Truths, particularly the first truth on suffering. Harris will not admit this outright: he toots the atheism horn and labels himself a secularist and an iconoclast who decries all doctrines, but in reality he is philosophically a Buddhist and a defender and teacher of Buddhist doctrine.This is not meant in any way to be an accusation or derogatory. Buddhism can be a perfectly acceptable secular philosophy, and in fact books such as Buddhism Plain and Simple present a highly gratifying and intellectually honest approach to it as a therapeutic, secular humanist philosophy. My remark on how Harris is defending Buddhist doctrine is only meant to clarify, for the reader, what the book Waking Up is about. It defines spirituality mostly in terms of gaining insight into anatta, a quintessentially Buddhist doctrine.Buddhism is–in its less religious expressions–in all likelihood the most empirical of the eastern philosophies. Harris is aware of this, and justifies his commitment to Buddhism by saying that it gives “empirical insights about the nature of consciousness”. He says:… engaging a faith-based (and probably delusional) practice, whatever its effects, isn’t the same as investigating the nature of one’s mind absent any doctrinal assumptions. Statements of this kind may seem starkly antagonistic toward Abrahamic religions, but they are nonetheless true: One can speak about Buddhism shorn of its miracles and irrational assumptions. The same cannot be said of Christianity or Islam.Despite the superstitions that many Buddhists cherish, the doctrine has a practical and logical core that does not require any unwarranted assumptions.The teachings of Buddhism and Advaita are best viewed as lab manuals and explorers’ logs detailing the results of empirical research on the nature of human consciousness.Harris defines spirituality as the “efforts people make, through meditation, psychedelics, or other means, to fully bring their minds into the present or to induce nonordinary states of consciousness”. He equates spirituality, it seems, with learning to be comfortable sitting in solitude, and therefore being able to have introspection and an inner life. He also, interestingly, incorporates shamanic techniques into it.Investigating the nature of consciousness itself–and transforming its contents through deliberate training–is the basis of spiritual life...(Read Parts II, III, IV and V of this review at my blog)"
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6663546-ho-manh,Rating 4 out of 5,"I am genuinely interested in the study of spirituality and everything that relates to self-transcendent and transformative experiences. This is one of the books that I have always been waiting for. It did not disappoint me. The central argument of the book is that transformative experiences are possible, they are made possible by cutting through our illusion of the self, by our training our mind to stand free of distracting thoughts. He argue that cutting through this illusion, we will allow ourselves to live better and more fulfilled lives and achieve something close to lasting happiness. The account he gives on the futile of the default pursuit for happiness, many of us play out in our lives, is extremely lucid. We hope to achieve lasting happiness in the midst of our ever changing life and ever changing contents in our consciousness. This hope is not fruitful and not reliable, for we will only resort to the neurotic trance of mindlessly seeking pleasures and avoiding pains. Our experiences in the world are, by nature, transitory, changing from moment to moment, our most wonderful joy might only last for a few minutes. Departing from here, Harris argues the potential of the human mind is more than this game of doing our best to seek more pleasure and have less pain, we are already free, by training ourselves to recognize the selflessness nature of consciousness or more straightforwardly, by spending less time or none at all lost in thoughts. For the illusion of the self, he tries to convince us that the self is an illusion in two levels of arguments: the first is our recent break though in scientific research relates to these issues, the second is through his logical deduction from the observation of the nature of the mind and the self. His writing is very lucid, clearly indicates his best efforts to help readers understand that counter-intuitive notion of our self. However, Harris also makes clear that it is not enough to understand these reasons, to transform our sense of self, every one must do an experiment in the laboratory which is their own mind. By training our mind to pay intensely close attention to the arising and passing of the contents of consciousness (thoughts, sensations, moods, feelings, sounds, sights,..), we come to recognize thoughts just as thoughts, and we may even see the world is not separated from ourselves. It is possible to feel at one and eat ease with the world. He presents his memoirs as a seeker of wisdom. The story is inspiring and urging us toward the truly scientific spirit: we need not to believe anything under false pretense or bad evidences and reasons to gain great insights into the human mind. I very much like his critical analysis of the nature of spiritual authority, its usefulness and its risks for the masters as well as the students. I also like his view on drugs, and various techniques he presents in this book. To be honest, I am still largely confused about the selflessness nature of consciousness, for I have never stood free of my thoughts and distracted mind. So I hope to have more spiritual practices and training to glimpse what he was talking about. Another thing is ,as a reader of his blog, I find a bit cheated for many of the stuffs in this book were taken from the blog.

He views the purpose of spiritualism as realizing that our sense of self is an illusion, and that realizing this will reduce the suffering in the world.Broadly speaking, I agree with Harris's views and predilections, and there was a lot to like about this book. Nevertheless, I found it irritating in places.The good: Harris is well-versed in both contemplative practice and neuroscience, having spent many years deeply engaged with each. His explanations are often lucid. Frequently, this book comes off as a much stronger version of Wright's ""Why Buddhism Is True"", offering good discussions of what we know about what's happening in the brain. The discussion of divisibility of consciousness was quite interesting. I also appreciated the careful distinction between gradualist and non-gradualist approaches to enlightenment. The gradualist approach involves carefully training your mind over years, while the non-gradualist approach involves the sudden realization, nearly always with the help of a teacher, that you are already free. The author is sympathetic to the non-gradualist approach, and draws a lovely analogy. Suppose you are looking at a glass window, and you want to show your friend his reflection in the window. The gradualist approach is in some sense equivalent to having them get a clearer and clearer vision of what's *outside* the window. On the other hand, the non-gradualist approach seems to be more open to people *thinking* they've woken up when they haven't. In the end, I *think* Harris is suggesting that you need lots of gradualist training first, but it's honestly a little hard ot tell.The bad: Although the book is short, a large fraction of the book, perhaps a quarter to a third, is given over to attacks on religion that feel like strawman bashing. Even though I'm largely sympathetic to Harris's views on the subject, this is simply tedious. I do not need four pages on how Eben Alexander's Near Death Experience is not actually good scientific evidence of an afterlife. Many of the attacks are merely ad hominem.The ugly: The book is mostly not prescriptive. It offers little in the way of advice, and in fact, the book is somewhat discouraging to me as a seeker; this is especially irksome in that the tone of the book is meant to be encouraging. I'm left thinking the best path to waking up is first spend years in basic gradualist mindfulness training, then hopefully get lucky enough to meet a great non-gradual teacher, perhaps in the upper echelons of Dzogchen, who will wake me up? I would've loved for Harris to go a little deeper on this.The fact that the author himself admits to only very partial enlightenment after spending basically his entire twenties engaged in the practice fulltime is also somewhat discouraging. Given that Sam Harris seems to be a rationalist, I wish he would have gone a little farther and talked more explicitly about bounded computation time and cost-benefit tradeoffs, instead of alternately painting pictures of ""Why wouldn't you want to do this?"" and ""This is almost infinitely hard."""
75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13941368-bakunin,Rating 4 out of 5,"I hope you are fully awake when you read this because the findings in this review may change your perspective on things. The author, Sam Harris, is a well known atheist and public intellectual whose interests are wide ranging. I've been following mr. Harris podcast for a few months as he is my kind of intellectual: honest, concise and someone who tries to have an open conversation with those who differ in opinion from him. When I first heard the title of the book I thought it sounded like another sales pitch from an atheist. How can one be spiritual without religion? The notion seemed simple absurd. But Harris interests lie in the potential for our subjective experiences and that entails finding out more about the nature of consciousness. Mr. Harris has long been interested in understanding the nature of consciousness and has been practicing meditation with prominent gurus in India. He tries to experience nirvana but doesn't come close until he starts practicing dzogchen meditation whose goal is to experience and maintain a state of selflessness. Thats right you read: selflessness. This is mr. Harris main point - the self is an illusion. To explain how this is possible he goes on to explore our brain. It turns out that as a result of our brains having a left and a right hemisphere its possible in theory to cut the brain in half and thereby create two different consciousnesses (provided that one part is put in some kind of body). This is but one of the arguments for the self not existing. Meditation allows us to distance us from our thoughts and to thereby be closer to reality. Mr. Harris believes that the practitioners of meditation will become happier as it is our experience of reality which decide whether or not we are happy. Put in another way; the self is window from which we view the outside world and it is this window which decides who we should be mad at or who we should love. When we distance ourselves from this perspective we no longer have to be controlled by these feelings but we can free ourselves from them. This book has changed my perspective on life and indeed I am still trying to imagine what the consequences are of having no self. Being a libertarian I see the self and the individual as an integral part of my world view; should this be seen as an existential fact and not be considered when looking at society? How would a society be governed if there there is no ""I""? For now I view the insights as a way of not judging my environment and instead experiencing reality head on. This book will linger in my thoughts for weeks to come and so I view reading this book not so much as arriving at an opinion as starting another journey. Mr Harris put it this way: ""Yes, the cosmos is vast and appears indifferent to our mortal schemes, but every present moment of consciousness is profound. In subjective terms, each of us is identical to the very principle that brings value to the universe. Experiencing this directly - not merely thinking about it - is the true beginning of spiritual life [...]Open your eyes and see"" [p. 206]"

É um livro em que Sam Harris navega o tema e a espaços mostra um caminho, mas não é um guia.Infelizmente para Harris, e para todos nós que lemos o livro, muita da ciência que ele apresenta como estabelecida, está longe de o ser. Como toda a gente apaixonada por algo, Harris optou por ignorar a evidência. Mindfulness é um exercício excelente mas está longe de ser a panaceia que ele tanto quer convencer todos nós que é. Harris esforça-se por mostrar que a comtemplação que ele propõe não tem nada de metafísica, que é tudo científico e que este é o caminho que falta ao humanismo para finalmente estar ombro a ombro com a religião. E como eu gostaria que ele tivesse razão, mas não tem. Mindfulness é o que é e nada mais do que isso.A ironia máxima deste livro é que ao esforçar-se por tornar tão evidente aquilo que não tem qualquer sustentação científica, o próprio Harris acaba por ser um dos maus gurus que o próprio descreve no livro. Alguém que de tão convencido da sua verdade, é incapaz de ver a tremenda desonestidade intelectual que comete.Dou-me como sortudo por não ter lido este livro pelo tópico, mas sim pelo autor. Se tivesse lido este livro com o objectivo de entender melhor meditação, mindfulness e a tal espiritualidade sem religião, teria sido enganado, ou ficado muito desiludido. Vale (e salva) o livro pelo que dá a conhecer de filosofia e história oriental e pela partilha de episódios da vida pessoal de Sam Harris.Como última nota, se alguém tiver interesse em meditação e mindfulness, saque a app do próprio Harris que é muito melhor do que o livro."
77,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,Rating 3 out of 5,"Sam Harris, ever the rebel, takes on the task of combining hard-nosed science with an appreciation of ""spirituality"" as a respectable domain of human experience. To be more precise, he recounts, in somewhat autobiographical manner, ways of getting HIGH and HAPPY. He argues that meditation and spiritual practice can be good from a neurological and psychological perspective. His biases are clear from the get-go: Buddhism is good (at least when stripped of its metaphysical and cosmological excesses), Abrahamic religions are bad (always). Psychedelics are good, most other drugs bad.Eastern meditative practice (when stripped of its metaphysical and cosmological assumptions), and pharmacological self-transcendence (psychedelic drug use) are seen as the most fruitful channels to thrive.The biggest philosophical argument of the book is really quite simple, and quite intriguing. He argues for the view that the ""self"" - as a self-standing subject of experience - is an illusion. He asks the reader to try it out for him- or herself. Extensive self-help book this is not, but at least Harris's powerful rhetoric and suggestive autobiographical story of discovery might ignite the spark in the mind of a nascent seeker.Unfortunately, the book doesn't quite live up to its promise. It is more sketchy and anecdotal than a fully-fledged revolutionary thesis of the mind. Its philosophical notions of the mind are pretty basic. Even worse, his use of scientific data is scanty and superficial. For example, Harris makes much of the notion of the ""bicameral mind"" - a notion in heavy disrepute these days - without tackling alternative theories. The result is that Harris seems to cherry-pick scientific experiments and theories that support his hypothesis.Waking Up is a short and pleasant book that contains some gems of ideas, and a few really interesting novelties - including the notion that drugs and buddhism should be understood as corroborative of the atheist-scientist world view - but it doesn't take them for more than a short joyride. While he is riding the right horse, he isn't committed enough to argue for it more than haphazardly. It's a good first mile, though.It feels, in the end, more like a pleasant afternoon on MDMA than a life-changing religious experience."
78,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60246484-rob-price,Rating 4 out of 5,"https://pricelesseconomics.wordpress....I really enjoy the intersection that Sam Harris navigates between rational science and spiritual discovery. I’m not religious but I value my religious upbringing and principles I was taught in my formative years. I refuse to align with the anti-religion atheist types like Hitchens and Dawkins. I actually think there is a lot of truth to be gleaned from religious teachings. That being said, I relish my investigation of non-religious spirituality and I appreciate Sam’s contribution towards this pursuit. I agree that an ethical and spiritual life is possible without religion – it certainly presents a different set of challenges though. Many will find it simpler to take direction from a centralised authority and I can see why. My free-market and anti-authoritarian inclinations probably contribute towards my desire for a decentralised spiritual journey. And maybe other people’s commitment to religion, contributes towards their trust in centralised authority figures…?In Waking Up, Sam encourages people to investigate spirituality through mindfulness meditation. I support this pursuit. The way we think directly influences our experience of the world. Positive emotions like patience and compassion are teachable, while negative emotions like anger and jealousy can easily dissolve if we realised that they are usually generated by our ego. Meditation is an amazing tool to practice self-awareness, allowing people to contend with the trance of discursive thinking, to stop reflexively grasping for the pleasant and recoiling from the unpleasant so that we can engage in the present moment. As an economist, I enjoy the challenge of reconciling this motivation to focus psychologically on the present moment vs. my inclination for long-term thinking because it produces more constructive economic outcomes. I think these are entirely reconcilable. One can definitely have long-term plans and simultaneously a mindful awareness of the present. The approach should, hopefully, allow one to differentiate what is truly important about the future from what is merely noise. Additionally, it should enhance appreciation of the uncertainty inherent in the future and reduce hubris, like trying to predict its exact outcome."

In the book, Sam Harris provides an overview for the nonreligious how to be spiritual – or more specifically, how to be more aware of one’s consciousness and peacefulness by meditation. He states, “Spirituality remains the great hole in secularism, humanism, rationalism, atheism, and all the other defensive postures that reasonable men and women strike in the presence of unreasonable faith.” Harris is a neuroscientist and has a knack for explaining how our brains work and how mental discipline can lead one to a happier life. Harris attempts to wrestle the concept of spirituality away from where it as always resided, in the minds of believers of the supernatural. He argues that spiritually is a natural state based on experience and neurology and not anything supernatural or religious. He takes down the claims of near-death experiences, especially some of the recent high-profile cases which resulted in the subjects making millions on their New York Times bestseller-list book. Also fantastic was the conclusion of the book, in which Harris takes off the gloves in his criticism of religion. He contends, ""We have failed, generation after generation, to abolish the delusions and animosities of our ignorant ancestors. The worst ideas continue to thrive and are still imparted in their purest form to children.”Also interesting was the chapter about pharmacology. Harris talks about the therapeutic benefits of certain illegal drugs such as LSD and Ecstasy. I've never heard someone talk about such drugs in a positive, neurological context. The parts of the book that lost me were where Harris talks about his mediation training under his Eastern spiritual leaders. The history of some of these gurus and their movements seemed to drag a bit and felt like unnecessary information. I listened to his in audio and it was read by Sam himself. He has a pleasant but monotonous voice. There are parts I will go back and listen to. Overall, a good read."
80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8242158-jeremy,Rating 3 out of 5,"When I started this book about a year ago, I didn't give it much of a chance: ""A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion""? Blech! I'm glad I approached it with an open mind this time around. ""Waking Up"" is not unlike an Eckhart Tolle book for the more skeptical and scientific crowd.What makes this guide to spirituality so interesting is that it's written by Sam Harris--a rather acerbic atheist and neuroscientist(though he doesn't like to labelled an atheist any more than he'd like to be labelled a ""non-astrologer""). The man who wrote ""The End of Faith"" is making a case for spirituality!His basic thesis is that transcendent or so-called ""mystic"" experiences don't require any sort of belief in a religious doctrine. Harris argues that when you set aside all of the jargon and superstition, there is still useful information about states of consciousness in many of the world's religions. With a little practice and effort, many of these self-transcending conscious states are available to regular people, regardless of their religion. Though he doesn't care for the word, Harris makes a compelling case for the necessity of the term ""spirituality"" in the secular lexicon. He also argues that self-transcending experiences are crucial to our well-being and our understanding of the human mind. I think what I was most surprised to learn is that a lifelong atheist like Harris has had such an extensive spiritual journey. He takes the experiential claims of figures like the Buddha, Meister Eckhart, Lao Tzu, and Jesus very seriously. He dabbled in psychedelics in College, has practiced meditation under some of world's foremost spiritual teachers, and claims to have read hundreds of books on spirituality. An interesting read, no matter what your beliefs, it's the kind of book that will probably piss of Atheists and Religious people alike. But even if you disagree with his provocative arguments, Harris is the model of clarity and reason. Not to mention there are a lot of helpful tips inside for anyone interested in meditation. "

I was annoyed that Harris subscribed to the hard problem of consciousness, and he even admits to not understanding Dennett's view on the topic, but his writing on consciousness is extremely interesting and well-sourced. It's also very easy to read for people who are new to the topic.The section on the philosophical untenability of our sense of self was fascinating, the thought experiments it borrows from all over philosophy and psychology were illuminating (and make for great conversation!).His chapter on meditation was great, as I meditate a bit already I found it useful to hear about the experiences of a veteran. While I would have seen some of the things he wrote about before, the majority of it was completely new to me because he has studied teachers and traditions that are rarely talked about in the west, in my experience. It was quite insightful, and gave examples of meditation practices to try.The pieces on gurus and drugs was wonderful, a rollicking ride of cautionary tales and funny stories. It's great to get the sense of Harris as a person, instead of as an anti-religious monolith. It's also quite revealing of the difficult aspects of his journey before he got his PhD and wrote his books.Overall, as a Harris fan, I found the book very moving, and I'll be trying out much of what it recommends myself. It's not an academic book, so I don't judge it as such, but it still challenges me to look at the way I live my life differently. I'll be coming back to it, for sure."
82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4104567-tony-bertauski,Rating 4 out of 5,"Originally attracted by the subtitle, I was unfamiliar with Sam Harris being the new atheist. Clearly unafraid of controversy, Harris jumps into the fray. What I didn't expect was such a lucid description of contemplative practice via meditation, in particular Buddhism. While he doesn't consider himself a Buddhist, with all the chanting and ritualism that comes along with it, he details a long and rich history of investigating the mind through such practices, spending year long retreats in Nepal from as early as 20 years old. Harris seems to have walked the walk. And that I found refreshing.His writing, I think, is superb. His intellect is aptly on display, whether you agree with his positions or not, but his use of the English language is quite impressive. I found myself caught up, at times, in the literary flow. In my opinion, it's this factor and his fearlessness to engage in public debate that makes him so eager to engage detractors. If only, though, he'd focus more on the message and less on the battles, I think more people might hear him.Perhaps my only criticism of Harris isn't anything new, as others have pointed it out. There are many places in his writing--his books, blog, social media--that he becomes judgmental. And this, I think, unnecessarily erodes his fundamental message. This is especially true when he refers to monotheistic figures as ""crackpots"" or various other names. This is the same trap other high-profile atheists seem to step in--the tongue-in-cheek, condescending eye roll. Even for non-religious people, it's tiresome and provocative. The evidence might point in the direction of absurdity, but let the reader arrive at that conclusion. I think his message would be better served if it didn't carry the undertones of snark and, at times, vitriol. "

If you are actually looking for spirituality without religion, stay clear. You will almost certainly be insulted. You likely won't keep reading, which makes Harris' only real audience people looking to reaffirm their bias.I read Michael Shermer's book How We Believe a few weeks ago. The content is very similar. Unlike this book, it is aptly titled. Atheists can be like bulls in china shops. Harris is one of these atheists. Not once did I find Shermer to be insulting in a book twice the length. This was also the case in many other books I've read on this subject. Harris is belittling and arrogant. For all his proclaimed awakening, he fails to realize his hubris is reinforcing his bias; particularly when it comes to his inherit racism. He makes the absurd claim that the East has hardly contributed to scientific discovery. Any historian knows this is blatantly false. He claims the East has neither contributed to medicine nor governmental structure. More evidence of a whitewashed history. Toward the end of the book, he rips apart a neuroscientist for not following lines of scientific reasoning. While I agreed with his argument, he stands on relatively unstable ground, as Harris doesn't do this either. Even something so simple as citing a poll he fails at. A specific example is when he references a Gallup poll on belief in evolution. I knew the percentage he wrote was wrong immediately, because I'm familiar with the poll. It was referenced in Shermer's book, as well as a more recent book by Richard Dawkins I read last month. I went to the notes in the back, in which it wasn't cited properly. I went to the Gallup website and checked the poll from when this book came out. The figure wasn't even close. Harris was just straight-up wrong. "
84,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1536210-createitlibrarian-amanda,Rating 3 out of 5,"Sam Harris argues reasons to meditate and alter your consciousness to gain spirituality. He makes arguments that you can transcend your current state of feeling a self to feeling outside of yourself. I myself haven’t experienced this through meditation. Nor have I used psychedelics. Maybe I’m missing something? But I’m really not all that concerned with it, because I believe in gratitude, meditation, and many aspects of both caring for your health. My goals for finding meaning are to enjoy the present moment with people, with nature, and with myself. That is where meditation has meaning. Showing up and being present in what I’m doing in the moment. Because I’m never going to get that moment back. I suppose ultimately that is what enlightenment means to me. I’ve read enough about Buddhism to know that what we deem as the self is constantly changing, so in Buddhist philosophy, there is no self. Nonetheless, our general personhood or sense of what kind of person we are doesn’t change too dramatically without some major life occurrences. And to be honest, the sense of who a person is is what attracts me to another person. Most definitely there is a self and yes the self changes throughout time which makes it hard to pinpoint the self indefinitely... needless to say, I can determine what a person is like as well as what goals I have for myself to be like. Meanwhile, we can be delusional about ourselves and misinterpret what another person is like. I’m sure I could discuss this for hours and maybe change my mind. But my spirituality is really just being present, enjoying other people, and enjoying nature... especially with an awareness that these experiences are fleeting."

Spirituality is something I could never divorce from religion, always thought of them as a symphony or exchange of values which is empty without its counterpart. Harris helped me understand that the dogmatic aspects of religion need not accompany us on our spiritual journey. An immensely liberating experience that is. It's an interesting read for anyone looking into the domain of spirituality but without the mysticism and fluff that surrounds it most of the times. I can see my future self coming back to it. "

He along with Dawkins and Hitchens espoused publicly very rational atheistic views which were and are very critical of religion in general and Islam in particular, a first for academia with regards to IslamBut if you're expecting that style here then you'll be disappointed. Here Sam argues that is no such thing as self or an independent consciousness, basic Buddhism right off the bat. He recounts the benefits of meditation and that a spiritual experience is open to all regardless of religious belief. Again basic Buddhism. He also describes that the charlatans exist. Buddha himself warned of these. Sam was interesting but his time has past. His voice, which I can hear in my head whilst reading is droney, and this book has that quality, it goes around in circles in fact and grows tedious. He's a bit too in love with himself for my liking, he rips apart a book on near death experiences, but when I've heard him debate actual theists such as Dr. Jordan Peterson, he deliberately stalls the flow and stifles the debate. The elimination of Ego is a basic tenet of spirituality and in that Sam has a way to go.Look to Gabor Mate, Jordan Peterson and even Steven Pinker for more succinct and enlightening philosophy or more importantly basic Buddhism books. They will help much more than this. That is Buddhism without drug assistance."

That he didn't totally convince me in this book is maybe a sign that I'm a horrible anti-spiritualist.By ""spirituality"", he generally focuses on medication and other contemplative/transcendental thought, although psychedelic drugs were discussed, as well as conventional religion. His general argument is that while religion is generally very bad (Islam being approximately the worst, and other Abrahamic religions pretty bad too), there is some value in it, mostly in the form of how to think about consciousness and contemplation. Buddhism is particularly strong here (for a religion), but he discusses forms of not-inherently-religious meditation as well.Yet again he convincingly demolishes religion, but I'm not sure what value there is in spirituality without it. It did slightly motivate me to explore meditation at some point when not driving at 130kph through Italy, however.It was interesting hearing how an early MDMA experience and early-20s extensive LSD and psilocybin experiences were instrumental in his life."

We can study consciously empirically, and doing so accrues valuable benefits to both humanity's body of science knowledge, and emotional health and wellbeing of such seekers.2) Rescues society from stupid religious dogma and poorly considered ethics. The established body of teachings of most religions are just objectively wrong, and yearning for spirituality and an ethical society is no reason to pretend, or have ""faith"", that they can somehow make sense. The bible, the Koran, and especially the Book of Mormon are all impossible to believe literally with even a small effort at logical or educated thinking -- yet billions of humans continue to believe their literal meaning, which holds back humanity. I love the current Pope's reform attempts and he many make humanity better, but almost all traditional catholic teaching is objectively irredeemable.So, Harris guides us in a positive, inspiring direction, quite lucidly and without pretension."

The book was interesting because I was a major in psychology as well as have a divinity degree.

116,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59340194-hamish,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've been aware of Harris for quite some time, but had always thought of him as a fairly basic public intellectual: someone who would appeal to the sensibilities of people starting out on their intellectual journeys and only just coming to grips with the basics such as the non-existence of God. But after I got interested in Jordan Peterson a few months ago, I saw Peterson's appearance on Harris' podcast recommended in a few places and so gave it a listen. My initial impression was that the views espoused by Harris were trite and obvious: Humanism and Rationality 101. However, he also struck me as an extraordinarily articulate and witty defender of these views.I was impressed enough by his conduct that I decided to give one of his essays a read. I chose ""On Lying"" for reasons I cannot recall. The position advocated is that people should tell the truth basically all the time. The commonly held view that in many social circumstances lying is both necessary or even desirable is incorrect. In these circumstances the apparent rectitude of lying is at best due to a local maximum, and at worst the result of duplicitous cowardliness to avoid an uncomfortable interaction. I have what you might call a fairly low social intelligence and have a history of getting into trouble which could have been avoided by lying. As a result Harris's argument struck me as aligning with my natural proclivities (and thus not being particularly useful) and also of working with an unrealistically rational model of other people. Sure, in the world of phlegmatic intellectuals a always-truthful policy might be optimal, but in the real world where people self-consciously hold irrational views, and institutions are forced to adopt irrational policies for game-theoretic reasons, you do need to do a certain amount of lying to get by in the world. But then after giving the book some more thought, I gradually came round to the view that *yes*, my natural tendency *was right* and I had allowed myself to be duped by the worse nature of my pro-lying peers. The book was thought-provoking enough to make me think I should give another SH book a read.There seems to have been a trend in the books I've been reading lately, where the first 20% of content is fascinating, and the latter 80% is altogether dispensable. Waking Up nicely complied with this pattern. The first 20% was about the value of psychedelics. I had heard Harris talk about these a bit in the Waking Up podcast, but got a lot out of hearing him flesh out his description. There are many ostensible benefits from psychedelics, both epistemically and morally. Epistemically, they provide first hand proof that radically different kinds of consciousness are possible. Exactly how one can cash out this knowledge is unclear, but this does seem like an important thing to know about the world. Morally, one is allegedly able to experience a state of unadulterated love and compassion. Being more loving and compassionate seems very likely to make one a more morally efficacious agent, and indeed a happier human being with more fulfilling relationships. Although the feeling of pure compassion does not carry over to the post-hallucinatory state, the memory of what that state felt like will persist, and can prompt one to take further measures to further develop one's empathy through meditation. A bad trip could also give you a first-hand experience of what psychosis feels like, which is itself both epistemically valuable, and helps you empathise with those afflicted with mental illness. Finally, although not directly addressed by Harris, the novelty value seems high.I find myself in agreement with Harris on nearly everything, the only differences in belief structure seem to be that Harris holds his belief with more conviction than me. Normally this means that I don't learn much from hearing him talk. The psychedelics thing is the one exception; the one extra puzzle-piece to add to my world-view that has made listening to him worthwhile. And because we think along such similar lines, I am led to wonder how it came to be that he dropped out of Stanford and spent several years taking drugs and meditating, an course of action which seems unthinkable to me. After all, *he* didn't have any Sam Harris to convince *him* that they were highly valuable for philosophically and scientifically minded people. The only explanation I can think of is that he used to have a very different temperament to how he appears now: a paradigmatic example of Spock-like rationality. But it is just the fact that this possibility was so far off my radar that makes the unlikely fact that he did happen to become an expert in spiritual experiences so valuable.After the psychedelic talk, Harris goes on to some philosophy of mind which struck me as pedestrian. He spent a lot of time stating that the ego is an illusion; you are not identical with your internal representation of yourself. That is just one of the many ingredients that go into the soup that is your mind. I think Daniel Dennet put better by comparing the ego to the fictional but functionally useful centre of gravity of a rigid body. Harris' thinking seems to orbit around the so called hard problem of consciousness. He is open to dualist theories of mind which seems to me like he doesn't have a deep appreciation for the hard sciences. This part struck me as containing a decent amount of woolly thinking and it was because of the woolly thinking that Harris identifies value in spirituality in general, rather than psychedelics, meditation, and morality in particular. I guess he's probably thought about the question more than me so perhaps reading ""Consciousness Explained"" has led to me being an irrationally zealous eliminativist. One idea Harris drew some attention to is that when you pay attention to the contents of your perception, within the theatre of your phenomenal experience you don't have a head. This struck me as an interesting way of framing things.The other main topic which was covered in Waking Up was the fraudulent side of spiritual gurus. I found this whole section rather disturbing, and because it was near the end rather negatively coloured my experience of reading the whole book. Apparently there is no shortage of gurus and/or cult leaders who have extracted both wealth and sexual favours out of their dupes as exercises in resisting their egos. The most disturbing incident was one in which a minor was forcefully undressed, some onlookers became disturbed and retreated to their hotel room, at which point their door was broken down and they were forcefully extracted (with some broken beer-bottle mediated violence) and themselves forcefully derobed. If this kind of conduct can be justified under eastern spirituality, then I'm not at all convinced that we have much to gain from importing its practices as Harris recommends.In summary, I'm not particularly impressed by Harris' speculations on the nature of mind or on spirituality, but I think he does make a good case for psychedelics and meditation (in that order: the former shows you something to work towards with the latter). And the framing of having no head was also interesting."

It is all that can be seen and that which does the seeing. No matter how far you have traveled from the place of your birth, and however much you now understand about the world, you have been exploring consciousness and its changes. Why not do so directly?""First of all, You need to consider that this book -Some of its chapters- is not an easy read for a non-native English speaker, or maybe for me at least since it's the first book I read in the neurology field. I read it because the idea of managing my ""waking"" life seems like a wise thing to do in the long run. And you cannot separate yourself from your own consciousness, therefore, knowing much about it seems a rational approach to life itself in order to experience it fully.The writer begins his book by looking back on his youthful experience in attempting to contemplate & meditate, then tries to explain several terms like the mind, self, ego, consciousness & areas of the brain and offer very good analogies making it less difficult to comprehend.then goes to explain through studies what makes mindfulness so effective after examing parts of the human brain and explains the wrong idea people get about meditation by blocking all thought process instead of observing every thought and feeling comes and goes and gives a practical way of doing it. after that, he goes back again in time reflecting his experience and thoughts in meditating with a well-known Buddhist gurus. to be totally frank, my foreign mind could not grasp or comprehend some of what he was saying, but in order to feel good about myself, I definitely blame it on my weak coffee. lastly, comes a chapter where he talks about the definition of Guru and what it meant and how can there be ""fraud"" gurus with mentioning famous ones and their bizarre behavior, that reminded me of the documentary Wild Wild Country (2018) which is a must-see if you haven't.Overall, this is a good book if you're interested in knowing more about the human consciousness and the way to meditate in an articulate way.Rating: 4\5"
118,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50214576-mari,Rating 3 out of 5,"When I explain my atheistic spirituality to people, the usual answer I get is ”just like Sam Harris”. I have now read Sam Harris and can announce that to be false. Although we’re both rational anti-bullshit atheists, our take on what spirituality has to offer to a person seems to be quite different.The main theme of this book, for what I understand, is self-transcendence and banishing the illusion of separateness and the distinctive ”I”. I think this is the most harmful teaching in all religious practices; it’s the very core that allows mistreatment and abuse. Although Sam is very responsible with his case and suggested forms of practice, this is not something I’m willing to readapt into my life after escaping it once.My spirituality is much more about worshipping and nurturing my self and my ego, my will and my distinctive personality as a god (for the record, everyone should be their own god, and the nature should be one too). I’m playtesting various religious practices and ways of thinking, throwing stuff on the wall and seeing what sticks: what makes my ”self” happy. It’s been studied that placebo works even when you know it’s placebo, and that’s the force I’m leveraging for my benefit.While it might be scientifically accurate that the separate self indeed is an illusion, I think it’s an extremely useful and important one. It should not be confused with soul, which is obviously just a tool invented for gaining control. The self is fluid and changing, but there’s still continuity that makes me the distinctive ”I” that I am. Or, at least, having that experience makes me happier, which is enough.It’s not a bad book at all, Sam writes well. Again, he’s also very responsible, which is super important in these kind of matters. However, the message is mostly unadaptable to my spiritual practice, which is disappointing. Worth a read, but one shouldn’t take this as the flagship of what atheistic spirituality is."
119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41367848-somiadorelegit,Rating 4 out of 5,"Esta es la segunda vez que leo este libro. Lo leí por vez primera allá por el verano de 2018 cuando estaba en plena efervescencia de mi glow up post crisis de los 20. En ese entonces empecé a interesarme por la filosofía oriental y apenas leí algún que otro clásico y empecé a meditar regularmente (aunque ese hábito tuvo un año y pico de parón). También empezó la típica etapa de frikeo extremo sobre psicodélicos justo al mismo tiempo, por lo que el hecho de que me topara con este libro y lo leyera no es ninguna sorpresa.Lo que si que ha sido una sorpresa es que en esta segunda lectura, tras varios años de vida con más experiencia y lecturas, no haya cambiado mucho mi opinión del libro, pues suelo con el paso del tiempo cambiar bastante mis percepciones de lecturas pasadas.Me mantengo como entonces, aunque ahora con más autoridad creo, en la opinión de que es un libro bastante guay como introdución al mundo de la espiritualidad y en concreto la meditación, especialmente para personas que como yo no quieran embadurnarse con los lodos de lo New Age más ridículo o que aún no estén preparadxs para saltar a textos religiosos. Es verdad que aún cuando Sam Harris es un referente del movimiento de lxs New Atheists, este es un libro que seguramente no convencerá a muchxs de lxs seguidores de éste, ya que aunque Harris escribe con un talante y estilo de liberal y racional, está lleno de experiencias suyas directas con gurús, prácticas esotéricas y demás que, aunque como digo partan de un autor referente entre lxs ateos, me da que no calará mucho con los intereses y opiniones a veces bastante dogmáticos (por lo que he podido ver) de ese público. Los primeros capítulos aunque interesantes y más difíciles por lo complejo de su objeto de interés (el yo, la mente, etc) no son tan buenos como los últimos, sobre meditación, gurús y drogas. Aunque muchxs justo lo critican, lo que más me ha gustado del libro son las anécdotas, tanto ajenas como personales que Harris narra sobre personajes dantescos del mundo religioso y espiritual o sobre psicodélicos.En definitiva, un libro cortito (281 páginas) que se hace relativamente ameno y está lleno de anécdotas y curiosidades interesantes para lxs interesadxs en estas cosillas."
120,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9300748-noel-burke,Rating 2 out of 5,"I read this book because I was challenged to listen to an opposing worldview from my firmly held Christian beliefs. Let me start with what I appreciated.1. Mr. Harris has a very respectful tone in the book. I never felt like he was overly bashing or venomously attacking those who held contrary beliefs. 2. I appreciated and agreed with his assessment of Near Death Experiences (NDE). To summarize, they are not reliable or trustworthy. From a Christian perspective, I am very skeptical of the popularized NDE events that provide someone with an opportunity for a bestseller book and a load of cash. I think the NDEs out there (even the ones claiming to be Christians) is not to be trusted. God's revelation (the current Canon of Scripture) is closed. He has given us everything we need to know in order to believe in Christ, live for Him, and prepare for His second coming. I was rather surprised by the book in general. I expected it to be a discussion on how religion causes people to be blind to the truth. Instead, I felt like it was Mr. Harris's attempt to write his philosophical views on reality. I was surprised at how many times he made assumptions about his thinking being correct on a subject based on nothing more than perspective, not logic. Let me point out just a few things that I was not able to accept.1. Stating, ""all there is in the world is the mind"" because ""there is nothing else"" is making quite a large assumption. Based on what? He later states that he came to this realization through extensive meditations. So, sitting quietly, thinking, being aware of your consciousness, etc. is a valid and logical way to determine that there is no God and all we have is our consciousness? I would respectfully disagree with that methodology. Would it be fair then to say that if I just think about the existence of God long enough it makes it true? I don't come to the reality of God by simply thinking about it for a long time. I come to that realization first because God revealed it to me through His Word and through the Holy Spirit, but also because it is the only logical explanation for the existence of anything. To believe that we came from nothing is illogical. That defies the law of non-contradiction and the laws of thermodynamics. 2. The author discusses the concept of split brains and the possibility of two souls. He directly links this to the Christian belief that a soul without repentance of sin and faith in Christ is damned to Hell. If each side of the brain is unaware of the other then is it possible for one side to profess faith and the other to reject it? Does one side go to heaven, while the other to Hell? Fair question. While I am not an authority on this topic, I would first point out that the fall of man into sin produced all kinds of problems. Weeds, cancer, sickness, guilt, weariness, etc. are all a result of the sin of man. We are all fallen image bearers of God. We are all shattered images and distorted from the good creation of God because of that sin. It does not surprise me that something like a split brain would occur in a distorted, sinful world. If there was a case where a man did profess faith on ""one side"" of his brain, I believe God would save the whole man. This apparent contradiction is only a paradox in my opinion. 3. The author states that killing others is wrong simply because it robs them of joy and causes pain and suffering of another. The premise being that humans should seek to avoid causing these against another. Here is the fundamental problem with someone who does not believe in God: if there is no God then who cares about anything that we do? Who cares if I harm someone else, who cares if I steal, rape, or pillage to my heart's content. Who cares if I am the victim of these terrible things? Why does it matter? If I will simply return to dust then it does not matter if I live a life full of killing others or I am the gentlest human being considering others needs before my own. It does not matter because nothing happens afterwards. This is a very bleak view of existence. It also raises questions about why someone who does not believe in the existence of God has convictions about what is right and wrong or feels guilt about their actions if there is nothing outside of this world. If you return to dust when you die then you should not feel guilty about your actions. You should be indifferent towards everyone regardless of what they do because there should be no standards by which a person lives. Life is meaningless if there is no standard to live by. 4. The author stated that he allowed for things like clairvoyance and telepathy but had not seen science back this up. I found this interesting. He had faith in (or allowed the possibility for) something that he could not see or prove empirically. Yet this same rationale is used to discount the existence for God. God simply could not exist because he is neither seen nor measured. Shouldn’t you apply the same standard across everything, and not simply what promotes your preconceived assumptions about existence? 5. This is just a personal opinion, but I disagree with his hope that his kids try drugs like LSD and ecstasy simply for the experience. I'm sorry, but that sounds like bad parenting. There are laws against that kind of thing for a reason. Have you seen how Colorado has responded to the acceptance of certain drugs? It's not a model to follow. How is it that the most intelligent people are intelligent, not based on their use of mind-altering drugs, but simply the use of their minds? I was shocked that he opening desired for his children to participate in the drug culture. I feel like that is setting them up for failure in so many ways. Again, personal opinion. I obviously disagree with the author's worldview but tried to find concepts that I could respect or agree with throughout. He certainly seems like a nice person and I am sure I could have a very pleasant conversation with him on these topics. However, I find that some of the same areas that he critiques in the Christian faith, or religion in general, are also found present in his own paradigm establishment. "
121,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/172359658-luke-lalonde,Rating 3 out of 5,"The fact that in 200+ pages he gave less than a page to “The Paradox of Acceptance” bothers me, and what he does write in this section is not satisfying. “It is important to distinguish between accepting unpleasant sensations and emotions as a strategy — while covertly hoping they will go away — and truly accepting them as transitory experiences in consciousness… The paradox is that we can become wiser and more compassionate and live more fulfilling lives by refusing to be who we have tended to be in the past. But we must also relax, accepting things as they are in the present, as we strive to change ourselves.” Writing that true acceptance means viewing discomfort solely as a transitory experience in consciousness ironically seems to deny the usefulness of discomfort as a tool for growth. Of course we all hope for discomfort to recede, and I think the message he is giving here points toward apathy; I feel similarly about his take on emotional responses and how anger, for example, unravels if you simply stop feeding into the thoughts which reignite the emotion. I get that he is just urging awareness so as to not be controlled by emotion, but I fear throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Maybe in this case it’s just semantics on the meaning of “acceptance,” which is why I wish he would’ve given more on this point.He also seems to treat some things as self-evident that leave me wanting more explanation, especially with regard to morality, which seems an odd omission in a book touting “spirituality without religion.” Given he is challenging the framework most of us use to view ourselves and the world (the self), at least a section on how he defines “the good” would be useful, rather than just criticizing religion as propagating the “damaging lie” that insists we must take something on faith in order to establish a non-relative moral basis. Maybe I just need to read The Moral Landscape and come back to this one."
122,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29406296,Rating 1 out of 5,"aka ""Spirituality for Atheists"", Sam Harris surprisingly has invested a lot of energy into a field of study that he unequivocally condemns as anti-intellectual. While some parts of the text approach being interesting or illuminating, every few pages Harris will remind the reader that religion is illogical, religious people lack reason, and he's not talking about their practices. And he's not, in all of this rambling he focuses only on the positive aspects he's gleamed from Buddhist practices (minus the Buddhism). Forget Christianity or Islam, the two largest religions, for Harris they offer nothing to the world but misery. He had the perfect opportunity to discuss the mythical experience of spirituality which transcends all artificial boundaries, but he didn't take it. From someone with a religious or spiritual background, this book will have nothing you can glean new information from. Like Chris said in his review, ""He should have given us some real tools with which to make our lives meaningful in the spiritual sense without resorting to religion."" Harris fails to do that, and he fails to offer anything substantial about the quest for fulfilling spiritual experience. His advice: take drugs and meditate. Do with that what you will. "
123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11423376-jacob-williams,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm still not a huge fan of the term ""spirituality"", but this at least helps me better understand why some nonreligious people would choose to use it. More importantly, this book is a pretty compelling sales pitch for meditation. Harris presents it not as a permanent panacea but, perhaps, as a panacea that's available to use for a few minutes at a time, which is certainly something I'd like to have available to me.An important claim underlying the book is that the self is an illusion. Interpreted in a certain way, that claim would obviously be false; I'm writing this comment, so clearly I have no trouble using the word 'I' to refer to something that exists. A better way to interpret it is that there is no persistent, clearly delineated entity that exists across time and corresponds to 'me'. I think the kinds of thought experiments and psychological data that Harris mentions provide strong reasons to believe there is no such entity. Still, even if that claim is rejected, the book's point that we know it is possible to experience certain desirable conscious states that are not part of our everyday experience, and that it's worth exploring whether certain spiritual traditions have managed to develop techniques for inducing them (even if their understanding of why those techniques work is misguided), seems reasonable."

He gets very hung up on language and word definitions, and describes religious people with mockery and lack of compassion. He goes on about how the Buddha is not omniscient for two pages. I don't believe many western readers would believe being enlightened means having limitless power knowledge and skill, yet he really labours the point. Like many atheists I feel he falls into the trap of taking everything literally, and not seeing value in metaphor, symbolic practice, or ritual.Whether you are religious or spiritual or not, there are many better books written about cultivating happiness and meditation, from a neuroscience perspective. Buddha's Brain by Rick Hanson is a great place to start. "
125,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"Despite my qualms about Harris' over-rationalism, I think he does a good job about threading the line of spirituality between religion and science. This book is a great cross-sectioning of Sam's expertise, a it pulls very heavily on his experiences working as a neuroscientist, studying meditation, and taking psychedelics (and could probably benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of his background before jumping into the more heady content).As a reader, I felt like this book could almost be broken into two and a half books, where the first part discusses the possibility of what spirituality without religion would look like, the second part inspects the nature of consciousness by bridging neuroscience with meditation, and the last snippet is just a potpourri of peripheral commentary. The second portion was very fascinating and plays well to Sam's background, and I especially liked his usage of split-brain experiments as an evidence of the divisibility of consciousness. While I think this book could be structurally improved in a number of ways, it's a great sort of grounding point for Sam's perspective for anyone who listens to his podcasts. "

The primary message that Harris is trying to communicate is the absence of “the self”. Although I do not yet grasp this concept fully, I feel as if there was a sort of spiritual shift that I went through when reading this book. I am rather careful with my words here, I would not dare to call this anything close to “awakening”, but I can sense something. A slight shift, just a small nudge, no idea to what direction. I am excited to explore this concept in my meditation practice, as well as in mindful moments every day. Give this book a chance, Sam's writing is clear & concise, and he has a good sense of humour too."

I tried to go in as open-minded as I could, and I was intrigued by the idea of a secular definition of spirituality. Also, I'm well aware of the documented benefits of meditation as a tool for retraining the brain.Where Harris lost me was when he left science behind to spend half the book wading through philosophical thought experiments, and I'll admit that's a personal bias but it's where I'll plant my flag. I've always found philosophy supremely annoying, and I deny that there's any value to ""thought experiments"" with no real-world basis that produce no real-world results. There's no truth to be found there, just truthy-sounding gibberish. I'm also reminded of Amos Tversky's comment about philosophy: that philosophers test their theories on a study group of one - themselves. That's exactly what Harris recommends to the readers, and his convictions about the nature of consciousness have all the unverifiability as any other feeling of religious rapture."

Its objectives are to validate spiritual experiences without believing in any form of higher power, to affirm that the sense of self is an illusion, and that enlightment is never achieved, but still worth striving for. Some parts are almost funny, like the young woman officially declared to have achieved enlightment, but that later has to admit that "" some thoughts are entering her mind"". In my opinion, a mind without any thought for an extended time is more dead than awake."

Really loved his discussion that mental clarity and spirituality do not require the mythology of religion (which only complicates the benefit with guilt and fantasy/make-believe) - such a rational approach.

144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2233542-mike,Rating 1 out of 5,"I read Sam Harris’ new book, “Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion,” hoping to learn more about consciousness, meditation and spirituality. My brother and his friends believe that consciousness exists outside the human body, and the brain is simply an instrument to tie into it. They also believe that meditation is the primary tool to appreciate “ultimate reality” which is a fantastic realm of human existence beyond the garden-variety one that I experience. I have resisted doing the simple exercises my brother says will prove to me that he is correct. But I’ve felt a little silly. Why do I refuse to spend a tiny amount of time with something that could forever transform me into something better? I decided to at least read Harris’ book to see if there is something there. Here’s a guy who thinks all religions are dangerous superstitious nonsense. Surely he’d be a good person to get the straight facts from. I was disappointed in my quest. In the first chapter, Harris, like my brother, claims meditation is key to “enlightenment.” Maybe my brother was right! But what is “enlightenment?” Harris says that one who reached enlightenment “would no longer succumb to the primary confusion that thoughts produce in most of us: She would no longer feel that there is an inner self who is a thinker of these thoughts.” This is the main thrust of the “spiritual” part of this book, and while Harris spends many pages trying to explain this, I never “got” it. What’s wrong with having an inner self? What’s wrong with having thoughts?Harris says the thinking inner self is an illusion which leads to all human suffering. In the book’s conclusion he says, “Although we are only beginning to understand the human mind at the level of the brain, and we know nothing about how consciousness itself comes into being, it isn’t too soon to say that the conventional self is an illusion. There is no place for a soul inside our head.” This is the same mysterious mantra my brother repeats. Normal reality is illusion, and woe on anyone who falls for it.Chapter two is on consciousness, which I found mostly interesting, but a little navel-gazing. For example, Harris proposes a thought experiment. Suppose they invent a machine that can analyze your body, and recreate it molecule for molecule, atom for atom on Mars. Would the new person be you (have your consciousness)? What if they kept the old you around a while to make sure the “beam me up, Scotty” process worked properly? Would there then be two you’s? While it’s kind of fun to think about, I really don’t think you’re going to come up with profound insights about one of the world’s greatest mysteries (consciousness) from such impossibly unrealistic thought exercises.Chapter 4 is on meditation. Here we learn that an expert meditator has greater than 10,000 hours of practice. That is 13 years of meditating two hours per day! I’m really surprised they were able to find enough subjects for the scientific studies Harris quotes. We also learn that it’s almost impossible to find a good teacher for meditation, and without such a teacher, you may learn the technique, but enlightenment (as mysterious as it is to me) will escape you no matter how hard you try. Harris pretty much says there was only one person in the entire world who was able to explain it to him, and he had to climb a mountain in Tibet to find that person. In case you’re hoping to find that same teacher, he has since died, although maybe his son can teach you as well.Chapter 5 is on “Gurus, Death, Drugs and Other Puzzles.” Here we learn that enlightenment can be as easily achieved (albeit at a little more risk) with psychedelic drugs, particularly LSD and Ecstasy. We also learn that gurus are prone to narcissism, so to be very careful around anybody who says they have all the answers (hmmm….) We also learn that Harris does not believe that near death experiences have anything to do with enlightenment.I don’t know. Despite going around the world to study and work on enlightenment, meditating for months at a time, spending months on retreats, etc., Harris still seems to be a regular garden-variety human being, although a little more antagonistic toward organized religion than most. I don’t think I’m missing much. I do think meditation is an important tool for controlling your mind that everybody should learn. If you are going to be the boss of your mind, you need to learn to meditate. Because Harris’ book might actually discourage you from learning this important skill, I’m bumping it down to one star."

I won't comment on the attacks on religion since Harris's main arguments aren't present in his book (here he makes simple statements, without any proper explanations). I found his perspective on consciousness (and hence his definition of spirituality) very unique and understandable, with some very insightful questions regarding whether we would ever discover the physical substrate of consciousness. The endingof the book was disappointing, failing to provide any practical advice or different perspectives. "
146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44014282-eric-kirkman,Rating 1 out of 5,"in the wake of recent world events in the middle east, Sam Harris has seen his notoriety increase substantially over the past year. Whether a heated discussion with Ben Affleck on Real Time with Bill Maher, internet disputes with The Young Turks, or intellectual tugs of war with Reza Aslan and Glenn Greenwald; there appears to be no middle ground on whether you love or hate Sam Harris. Those who love Sam Harris cite his intellectual courage and straight forward analysis on how the central tenants of Islam demonstrate the motive and the basis for the numerous uprisings in middle eastern countries, whether it be the rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria, or Boko Haram in eastern Nigeria. Those who hate Sam Harris label him as a xenophobic harbinger of hatred and tolerance towards the world's muslims as a whole, who see no connection between the tenants of Islam and the rise of Jihad (in full disclosure, I feel this criticism is unfounded, inaccurate, and represents a gross misunderstanding at best and an intentional deceit at worst of Mr. Harris believes).Regardless of which camp you fall into, Mr. Harris' newest book, Waking Up, steers clear (for the most part) of the hot button topics of the middle east that have recently brought him so much fame, and instead deals with how those of us in a post-modern, increasingly secular world may still incorporate ""spirituality"" without the lense of religion. Such a broad topic seems difficult to cover in a thousand page book, especially when the majority of the readers this book is geared to have never tried the meditation techniques or are as familiar with the neurological workings of the brain that are extrapulated in the book. Sam Harris attempts to cover these topics and countless others in slightly over 200 pages. Unfortunately, the novel is disjointed, hard to understand, overly verbose when it should be simple, and in truth, difficult to read.The first chapter starts out with promise. Starting out with a story of a retreat in Colorado as a teenager, which Harris uses as a foray into what spirituality is and how we can find it, the opening chapter is crisp and easy to follow. Unfortunately, future chapters jump out of order and move into tangent that make this a choppy read. Learning about meditation techniques or how the brain is divided into two separate ""selfs"" is an arduous task when done with great care. Sam Harris jumps around these topics seemingly at will, leading readers on a maze that feels more like going through the looking glass than leading the reader to the intended conclusion.The other striking flaw in this novel is the writing. When you listen to Sam Harris during an interview or in a podcast, he speaks simply, concisely, and clearly. The writing in Waking Up, however, has excessive verbiage, long winded sentences and sometimes unintelligible paragraphs. While this flaw can hurt a book that deals with less complex subject matter, it absolutely destroys a book that deals with subjects this complex.Those who are fans of Sam Harris' firestorm critique of religion will find small morsels here to chew on, but they do almost nothing to further the book, and seem to be included only to remind readers of why they are fans of Sam Harris in the first place.Overall, as a fan of Sam Harris, I found this book to be a disappointment. While the book certainly does not lack ambition, its unclear writing and roundabout structure will fail to wake up it's readers and will likely cause them to fall into a slumber. "
147,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457154-jess,Rating 1 out of 5,"Rather disappointing on a few levels. In fact, I'm so displeased with this book that I'm going to bother to write the first long review I've done in years. First, whatever definition of ""spirituality"" Harris uses was quite different from what I was hoping to learn more about - not just the ""mere"" awe before nature (numinous, sublime, etc. that he dismisses) but also a sense of connectedness to the world and other people, inner peace, acceptance, some feeling of insight into and equanimity about how the world turns etc. That, I could deal with; we lack language and common frames of reference for such discussions, so obviously my atheist spirituality is different from his. When I did not like however, was more fundamental: he spends literally the entire book touting a method for touching spirituality, i.e. insight meditation, but spends barely half a page defining what exactly spirituality can be from the atheist point of view -- which is kind of important! As far as I can tell he means something about the nature of consciousness - but then one questions why this is being discussed under the banner of spirituality at all.Which brings us to what this book is: it's not really a guide to spirituality, its just a guide to meditation - and one very specific kind of meditation to boot. The entire book is basically an ode to insight meditation, except it again suffers from the flaw of telling you what you should do, without ever investigating what exactly it entails or putting forward guesses for why it might help to achieve...whatever it is that Harris thinks it is supposed to achieve; ""spirituality"", I guess: see point 1. Despite an anecdote at the beginning mocking the western fondness for ""eastern wisdom"", Harris doesn't really give us reason to believe that he is doing otherwise (even though I trust that his conclusions were arrived at after careful and broad study). There is little balanced consideration or discussion of non-Buddhist philosophy, religious or not, and the entire book was a little uncomfortable for me as it smacked (unavoidably, though, I think) of Eastern exoticism. For an author who is so dead set against accepting things on blind faith, whose readership is every bit as skeptical as he is, it was bizarre how Harris thought it would be okay to continually make bold but unsupported semiphilosophical statements about meditation and the nature of the self, and barely hedged assertions that Buddhism is correct as far as the nature of the mind goes.I am not against meditation or Buddhist philosophy; I practice meditation (on and off) and am from ""the East""; even though I was raised without religion I grew up understanding fundamental Buddhist and Chinese philosophies, and believe like Harris that some such teachings come very close to understanding the natures of the universe and the mind. But what I dislike about this book are the single-minded obsession with presenting these things as a panacea for - well, I don't even know what exactly; its poor writing (the book could have been cut down to 40 pages and lost nothing); and the fact that it taught me very, very little in return for the time I spent reading it.Finally, a summary of everything useful that this book contains -- and these are indeed very interesting points, just not worth 250 pages of poorly explained pseudoargument:1. Reality is all percept.2. Consciousness is all there is. 3. The self is an illusion.You're welcome."

149,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly,Rating 2 out of 5,"I am generously giving this a second star, and that only because of Harris' goal of getting atheists in general (and though unstated, Gnu Atheists in specific) to think positively about meditation in specific and spirituality, properly understood, in general.Otherwise, it's not that good of a book, mainly because it suffers from the usual Sam Harris flaws.First, he once again would have us believe that, unique among religions, Buddhism's sh!t doesn't stink.Counter that?1. Buddhists kill people of other religions, in the name of religion, just like Jews, Christians, Muslims and Hindus. They're doing it right now in Sri Lanka and Burma. (Please, don't trot out the ""no true Scotsman."")2. Buddhism is not ""all empirical."" Buddhists generally believe in two metaphysical principles, reincarnation, and laws of karma to govern reincarnation. The Dalai Lama has said if it's an issue of science or those two, then science goes, they stay.3. No, by no means do all Buddhists believe that Siddhartha Gautama was just an ordinary human who achieved enlightenment. It takes willful blindness to ignore the Buddha as deity ideas, especially an eternal Buddha as deity of whom Gautama was only one incarnation, sprinkled throughout Mahayana.4. This, then, ties with Harris in general. On a number of issues, and Buddhism one of them, Harris either refuses to be honest, or else is constitutionally incapable of honesty.5. The ""traditional goal of meditation"" ignores that the traditional Buddhist goal of meditation is enlightenment, and ultimately enlightenment to the goal of achieving nirvana.On consciousness and self, we have kind of a hash.1. Harris has yet to prove that self is an illusion. (And I agree with the ideas seemingly lying behind the findings of Libet and others.)1A. To the degree that ideas about ""consciousness"" and ""self"" are intertwined, how can one be an illusion and the other not?2. He at the same time doesn't ask why the whole of what we call consciousness can't be an illusion, or a confabulation created by the evolution of human psychology, or at best, a spandrel.3. He misinterprets split brain research; difficulties in the right hemisphere making ""itself"" understood, or communication difficulties between two hemispheres do not necessarily imply two different personalities, or selves. 3A. That said, it's interesting that, in light of his take on split-brain experiments, he doesn't entertain, and apparently has little truck for, ""subselves"" ideas of the likes of Dan Dennett.4. He views consciousness versus unconsciousness as two polarities, with no allowances for various steps or stages of subconsciousness in between. For someone so devoted to Buddhism, it's ""interesting"" to see him accept a duality like this.Anyway, I hope his goal succeeds. And, I hope he becomes more honest about Buddhism, and better sorts out his thoughts on consciousness vs. self. But, I won't hold my breath. We are talking about Sam Harris.And, it's interesting that most the touts come from New Agey types, BuJews like Harris (I think) is, or someone even more muddled on science of mind issues than Harris, namely fellow Gnu Atheist Jerry Coyne."
150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15992361-james,Rating 2 out of 5,"The best non-Buddhist book on meditation I have read (even though he studied with a lot of Buddhist teachers and there is a lot of Buddhisty stuff in the book). So why only two stars? Because it was ok. And lets’ be fair, the competition in this arena is not great. The author makes some very good points, and for the general public, that is those without formal training in psychology, neuropsychology, and mediation practices the book will probably be interesting and thought provoking. But Waking Up is really a prolonged opinion piece. A book length magazine article. Ok, I maybe a bit picky, but for someone with Mr Harris’ stated interest and experience in meditation, science, and “self-transcendence” I believe that more is required, and can be legitimately expected.A lot of emphasis was placed on philosophical understandings early on in the book which was unnecessary in my view. Thinking about the thinking about thinking when what the book was essentially advocating was experience was both unhelpful and unnecessary. There was also a lot of emphasis on brain function, and no real acknowledgement that, given the state of our knowledge in the area, this is a level of analysis that offers no practical benefit; apart of course from providing the illusion of understanding. It was also disappointing that psychological knowledge was not more meaningfully incorporated into the discussion. Psychology is the sole scientific discipline that came into being in order to examine consciousness, and while some studies were cited this tradition was largely ignored. This is disappointing as advances in Relational Frame Theory in particular can provide levels of analysis of the self, and its development that seemed to confound Mr Harris, and which offer more practical benefits than what has become known in recent decades as “neuroscience” (previously physiological psychology),  I also felt that the author made some of the usual mistakes that occur in books on meditation and in reference to Buddhist mediation practices. Given his apparent experience in the area this was disappointing. He described the Theravadan (forerunner of Insight Meditation) as the oldest Buddhist tradition without reference to the modern findings based on the oldest known Buddhist scrolls, or to the fact that some scholars regard the Buddha as changing his teaching over his 40 year teaching period. He both misunderstood and put down Zen in the one sentence he really devoted to it (why do people always misunderstand Zen, and then talk about it?). His descriptions also seemed to suggest consciousness as an entity rather than as an emergent or co-occurring/contextually determined series of events. Not cool in my view. He also seemed hung up on the old ending suffering shtick as a purpose of meditation. I much prefer an emphasis on fully experiencing what is rather than trying to get rid of something.But as I said, I may be a bit picky.Where the writing really takes off and is enjoyable is when Mr Harris is putting down religions, fools, and charlatans. He is good at this, and has the gifts of humour and critical insight in this area.So, overall, two stars. "
151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44414791-jacob-elder,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have read several books on meditation, Eastern philosophy/religion, or both. They have ranged from focusing on the technical aspects, the philosophical and spiritual motives underlying practice, and there was one, maybe two, that was very steeped in the metaphysical mumbo jumbo. Of all the books that I've read on this topic, this is likely my favorite.I admit, as big of a fan of Harris as I am, I was mildly skeptical of starting it due to the title. I have labeled myself as neither spiritual nor religious-- an atheistic-leaning agnostic who meditates. It's surely a trivial distinction, but it seemed like something that matters to me. But Harris begins to win me over in his argument early on when he concedes that he does not like the word spiritual necessarily, but as there are not many words available to describe the relevant phenomena detailed in this book besides ""spiritual,"" ""mysticism,"" etc., they will be used.As someone who is a fan of science, I appreciated his delving into the psychology and neuroscience research regarding consciousness in the brain. I have been interested in and practicing meditation for awhile now, but something I have battled with is the grandiose and seemingly unsubstantiated claims made by meditating-gurus and Eastern philosophers that often must just be taken on faith. Here, Harris does not require that you take up meditation or its benefits on faith. In fact, he discourages taking up anything merely on faith (I feel he perhaps becomes too fervent in his lambasting of religion in this book). I primarily loved this book for that reason, I would say. Many philosophers and gurus will suggest there is no self, and will tell you merely to meditate to find that it is so. Harris says this too, and encourages meditating, but he also provides convincing arguments via scientific studies to validate and support this notion. Ultimately, he acknowledges however that there are missing components to this argument and that it is not fully elucidated by science whether there is or isn't consciousness in the brain and whether there is or isn't a self within the brain or mind. He clarifies that only through meditating can you observe the non-existence of the self.Another couple aspects of the book that I enjoyed were his (a) his candidness in discussing the value of psychedelic and mind-altering drugs. It is rare to find academics and intellectuals who will openly encourage the use of particular drugs, even going so far as to imply he partially hopes his children will dabble in LSD and psilocybin. (b) I found his suggestion that not all religions are equal a bold and fascinating claim to make. Specifically, that Western religions are almost certainly not of the same value to people as Eastern religions, and they may even impede or inhibit development and self-growth. Whereas for Eastern religions, even if many of the metaphysical aspects may be dubious at best, there are incredibly insightful and empirically valid truths and practices to be derived from the ideology.

Some were more philosophical. What I liked about it: It turned out to be the kind of self-help book I needed at the moment – a reminder that how we feel very much depends on our mind. Also this book, along with the “Tao of Psychology” by Jean Shinoda Bolen, helped me to understand we don’t achieve clear or content mind for life. It is actually in little moments that we should learn to savor. What I disliked: There were quite a few places where the author expressed what seemed to me an emotional negativity towards religion. I don’t think it added much value to the book and was a bit uncomfortable to read. Also I struggled with the idea of “transcending of the self” that the book claims to be the core of spirituality. I have meditated daily for a year now, sometimes with the guided meditation audios by the author of the book. And yet I still couldn’t grasps the concepts he offers. Maybe I will try to re-read the book after another year of meditation.Ideas/ Quotes:Cognition and emotion are not separate. The way we think about experience can completely determine how we feel about it.How one uses one’s attention, moment to moment, largely determines what kind of person one becomes. Our minds – and lives – are largely shaped by how we use them. We manage to avoid being happy while struggling to become happy, fulfilling one desire after the next, banishing our fears, grasping at pleasure, recoiling from pain – and thinking, interminably, how best to keep the whole works up and runningSuffering may not be inherit in life, but unsatisfactoriness is. We crave lasting happiness in the midst of change: our bodies age, cherished objects break, pleasures fade, relationships fail. Our attachment to the good things in life and our aversion to the bad amount to the denial of these realities and this inevitably leads to feelings of dissatisfaction. It is your mind, rather than circumstances themselves, that determines the quality of your life. Your mind is the basis of everything you experience and of every contribution you make to the lives of others. Given this fact, it makes sense to train it. Subjectively speaking, the only thing that actually exists is consciousness and its contents. And the only thing relevant to the question of personal identity is psychological continuity (maintenance of one’s memories, beliefs, habits and other mental traits) from one moment to the next.Our habitual identification with thought - that is, our failure to recognize thoughts as thoughts, as appearances in consciousness – is a primary source of human suffering. All parents have seen their children put their growing powers of speech to use by maintaining running monologues with themselves. These monologues continue throughout life as though they were, in fact, dialogues. The resulting conversation seem both strange and unnecessary. Why should we live in relationship to ourselves rather than merely as ourselves."

155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4073273-roy-klein,Rating 5 out of 5,"I can easily see giving this book a much lower grade had I read it in a different time in my life.I imagine Sam Harris took a risk making such a book: Spirituality for skeptics. I know that as for myself, had I read it when I was in my early days of skepticism I would have probably dismissed it entirely. If you have zero initial interest in spirituality or have no one in your life that is interested in it, I'd expect you to be baffled by how anyone gave this book more than one star. If you aren't interest in spirituality but have someone in your life that is, this book will be useful to read for two accounts: It will help you understand the language and goals of those who are interested in it, and it contains a very important chapter about how to spot dangerous and fraudulent spiritual gurus. For this chapter alone I think this is a must read book. So, what exactly is secular spirituality? From my understanding of the book, there are two cognitive illusions that their exploration and attempt to see through, allows us to have a clearer understanding of our own nature, or even the mere possibility of inquiring into our own nature. The first, and easiest to accept for a skeptic, is the illusion that we are the center of the universe. Our whole lives we experience everything from our point of view and in relation to what we do; people cease to seem to exist when we are out of touch with them; events that don't concern us might not even have happened, etc. The second, which is harder to accept and understand, and therefore most of the book is spent on discussing and exploring, is the illusion that there is a self, a tiny being sitting between the eyes inside our head, thinking thoughts, experiencing experiences, and narrating to itself everything that is happening. Sam claims that once you train yourself to clean your mind from random thoughts (via meditation), the self itself ceases to appear to exist. It is not the originator of the thoughts, but an emergent illusion from the mere fact that we're having thoughts. This claim is based mostly on subjective experience, but is also backed by some empirical experiments done on the nature of consciousness and the brain.I have not yet experienced a selfless consciousness, so it is very hard for me to accept right now that this may be true, and what impact knowing and experiencing this fact has on oneself. I do feel, however, that breaking the first illusion has immediately beneficial to my own life so far.Breaking the second illusion will not happen just by reading this book. According to Sam, it requires training. Specifically, meditation. This book is mostly a justification for why you should meditate and a discussion into what you'd gain by doing so, and why. "
156,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40345685-chadi-trad,Rating 4 out of 5,"The main point of the book is to show how spirituality can be discussed without being intellectually dishonest about the nature of the cosmos. The author advocates that spirituality is the realization that there is NO real ""self"", a subject of our experiences, owner of our faculties somewhere in our heads behind our eyes. This illusion of ""self"" and the incessant dialogue that we have with our-""selves"" are the main causes of our suffering. Being a neuroscientist, Sam Harris makes his point by presenting several experiments in neuroscience as well as philosophical arguments. He recommends ""mindfulness"" using ""vipassana"", a Buddhist technique that showed clear positive psychological benefits as well as improvements in the brain physiology.In the rest of the book, Sam discusses a variety of topics including:- how most religions are obviously wrong about the nature of the mind- the pitfalls of Abrahamic and Buddhist spiritualisms- his journey of discovering spiritualism in India and Tibet- his experience with psychedelics in his twenties, and how much these drugs can help people realize in a matter of hours what's hard to realize in a lifetime.- how out-of-body experiences and near-death experiences are all based on the chemistry of the brain and are similar to the ""trips"" that can be had with psychedelics- the abuse by some spiritual gurus of their studentsOverall, I found the book to be a good read for three reasons:1- Sam Harris attempted to show how ""spirituality"" can be discussed in a scientific and secular way. (Most religious and non-religious people have trouble accepting the concept of spirituality in this context)2- The experiments in neuroscience presented showed how the conventional notions of ""self"" and ""soul"" are very wrong and misleading.3- The account of personal experiences of Sam Harris were interesting to read.What people may dislike about the book:- Judging by the title, the book can be expected to have much more ""instructions"" on meditation. The instruction part can be summarized in less than one page while the rest is about the personal experience of the author and some science and philosophy.- Sam automatically dismisses all forms of spiritualism that are faith-based, including Abrahamic religions and New Age spiritualism. He spends little effort in his book to persuade the reader of considering at least a skeptical/agnostic view on faith-based religions.Overall, I liked the book and recommend it for any person with a secular concern and is interested in psychology, philosophy or meditation."
157,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37390662-dennis-mccort,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a very good book (pro spirituality, contra C. Hitchens, R. Dawkins, D. Dennett and other current scoffers) for those who are on the fence and might need a push to get them to look into meditation, this being Harris's most highly recommended approach to investigating the spiritual, which he often calls ""self-inquiry,"" which I think is a sound and sober synonym for ""spirituality,"" avoiding as it does all the baggage attaching to that word over the centuries. Harris never lets you forget he is a rigorous scientist and never says more than a scientist can say within the bounds of empirical observation. He affirms that observation of the subject or self (i.e., introspection) can be empirical even if not directly sharable. Harris has one basic assertion to make about spirituality throughout the book, and this is that it is indeed possible to transcend the personal ego to a deeper level of consciousness that clearly sees through the ego's illusory nature, this experience being both liberating and joyful (because liberating). He dismisses all metaphysical claims (e.g., God, the nature of the universe, the soul, etc.) deriving from this basic fact as unwarranted and misleading interpretations added on to the basic fact of ego-transcendence by religions of all stripes. Hence his well-known and, from his own point of view, justifiable, condemnation of religion and the mistaken public view of him as ""anti-spiritual."" He's pro-spiritual but anti-religion, and makes a big point about the distinction in the book, not to mention the subtitle. On the other hand, he's not necessarily anti-guru and mentions several teachers he's had from whom he's learned much. But he stresses the usual caveat about choosing wisely, as there are legions of charismatic whackos out there enjoying the good life at the expense, financial and emotional, of their gullible students. Waking Up is a good, pragmatic and well-written book that makes great common sense about the issue. But for people who need no persuasion I think it can be safely skipped. Also, for those who need the devotional, inspirational, ""poetic"" aspect, Harris has little to offer. He's a highly intelligent, possibly brilliant guy who has no charisma at all. (I've seen him in TV interviews a few times and his cardboard persona bears this out.) But, since he's aiming in the book at no more than rational persuasion, and succeeds well in this, so what, right?"
158,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I had some frustrations with this book, but at the end of the day I can't help but feel like the core of it is, in fact, just wisdom. One of the most thoughtful scientific looks at spirituality I've ever encountered, it is a somewhat masterful separating of the positives of spirituality (from a purely scientific perspective) from anything that is more than scientifically based, and for that purpose it goes on the list along with Alan Watts and the like for me as useful in developing an understanding of reality that is accurate and which furthers one's life. Harris' meticulous segmentation of his understanding from beliefs from experiences from faith-based things is quite simply incredibly useful in helping people parse through and try to understand realms and aspects of the world that inevitably become profoundly complicated and confusing.I had two complaints. One was about the audiobook which, while read by the author, was read in an uncharasterically toneless and emotionless way that actually felt like it detracted meaningfully from the experience. I'm a follower of Harris' podcast so it was a real surprise to encounter this and seemed out of character for him; I'm not sure how a book that he considers so close to his heart could have come out sounding so foreign to him as he read it, but given that it did it would have been better to recognize that fact and get a professional reader.The second was the somewhat negative feeling one takes from this book. While Harris is very precise here (more so than usual) in differentiating what he believes from what he can't speak to, the overall tone is still condemning of forms of faith in a way and to a degree that seems slightly overblown to me, and the end result is a slight feeling of negativity about life and the world at moments in the book. This in comparison to the writing of the likes of Watts which, while not always so scientific in its approach, leaves one with both a deeper understanding of the teachings and simultaneously a bit more hope for the world. This dynamic was not so strong that one should not read it though, just a bit disappointing.Leaving me, overall, very much in favor of more people reading this book as an important perspective of modern spirituality from one of the clearest thinkers and foremost minds on the topic in this age."
159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11376979-dr-lloyd-e-campbell,Rating 5 out of 5," Sam Harris is an excellent presenter of unfashionable ideas. I thoroughly enjoy him and he pisses me off. As open as he is to exploring consciousness, meditation and the brain, he seems blind to his prejudices against religions. The theologian Paul Tillich defined religion as how one lives. From Tillich's point of view we all have a religion, some more consistently based on a value system than others, some more this worldly, others more other worldly. Harris has spent a lifetime attempting to understand consciousness, relieve human suffering and honestly dealing with complex philosophical questions. I admire him greatly for this. I would go so far as to say these are at the center of his religion.  Let me throw out another definition at you, this from another German theologian, Tillich's teacher, Rudolf Bultmann. Bultmann defines your god as that which you hold as the ultimate reality, that which guides your life. Harris seems to value an honestly lived loving life above all else. He is at home with authentic gurus, genuine people who have transcended the illusion of self. In my neighborhood we would consider these people religious in a more narrow definition than the one I threw out earlier. What is his abhorrence to the word religious and why does he seem to limit the term to a belief system? I also think dogmatism is more about how one believes as it is about what one believes. I find Harris dogmatic. My wife says I'm judgmental about a last point I want to make. Here's a guy who roams the world seeking out people to relieve his own suffering and to find real happiness. He has the time and the money to make such journeys. What about the suffering of people who live in real poverty, the people who wonder where their next meal is coming from, people who have lost limbs and worse? My wife says I have no right to contrast one's suffering with another's suffering. Perhaps she is right; perhaps she isn't. Life is more than what goes on in my head or Sam Harris' head though. Note I gave this book five stars. It is well worth reading. My review might not reflect how much I admire him. I want you to know I sincerely do admire him. "

The writing is crisp and the presentation of the ideas are exhibited with clear and logical progression in thought.

Harris ma niesamowite interdyscyplinarne doświadczenie: jest jednocześnie neurobiologiem, filozofem i pisarzem (I podcasterem).Jednocześnie jest też zwolennikiem łączenia ze sobą racjonalizmu i duchowości.Ludziom (i mi przed „Waking Up”) wydawało się, że nauka i duchowość to s�� dwa nie przecinające się zbiory. Autor jednak świetnie pokazuje (a ma dobre argumenty jako specjalista od neurologii), że duchowość ma swoje źródła w świadomości, a ta ma swój dom w naszym umyśle.Autor dobitnie pokazuje jak dużą krzywdę zrobiły sobie kultury zachodnie oddając duchowość pod twardą rękę zorganizowanych religii monoteistycznych. To spowodowało jej ograniczenie i korozję.Tymczasem duchowość da się rozwijać będąc niewierzącym człowiekiem. Harris pokazuje jak i dlaczego to jest ważne. Przez medytację, metakognitywistykę (myślenie o swoim myśleniu), bycie tu i teraz a nie w przeszłości lub przyszłości można uwolnić się od cierpienia braku kontroli nas własnym stanem umysłowym.Harris, choć napisał książkę o duchowości, nie wymaga, aby cokolwiek w niej brać na wiarę. Każdy „podejrzany” wniosek czy założenie jest oparty o długą listę naukowych przypisów. Nie ma tu mowy o czakrach, new-age’owym mumbo-jumbo czy duszy wszechświata. Jest za to dużo prowokujących pytań (czy Twój klon ma Twoją świadomość? Gdzie jest granica „Ciebie”? Czy ty sprzed 10 lat jesteś Tobą?) i ugruntowanego naukowo myślenia.Przesłanie tej książki jest proste ale niezwykle trudne jednocześnie: Jeśli nauczysz się obserwować co właśnie teraz robi Twój umysł zrozumiesz, jak dużo oddziela cię od tego, co właśnie się dzieje wokół Ciebie. A wtedy zrozumiesz że nie ma myśliciela Twoich myśli. Nie ma wolnej woli, nie ma „ja” - jest tylko niekończący się potok myśli. A Ty jesteś swoimi myślami. Rozumiejąc to ograniczysz niepotrzebne cierpienie, które same sobie zadajesz.Ps. Naturalną konsekwencją tej książki jest aplikacja do medytacji „Waking Up”. Korzystam z niej i polecam"
162,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7626390,Rating 5 out of 5,"First of all, I enjoyed reading/listening to every minute of this book, especially since it was read by Sam Harris himself. Second of all, I was already familiar with Sam's position and arguments regarding consciousness and the benefits of meditation, so most of the content of the book did not come as a surprise. The most interesting sections were the ones where he related his spiritual explorations in East Asia, and the different masters he worked under.Sam tries to clarify the difference between spirituality and religion, and how the later basically hijacked the term for itself, thus causing most skeptics of religions to also reject the potential validity of spiritual experiences. The issue of course is that many of those who claim to have such experiences, also make outlandish claims about the nature of human consciousness and the cosmos, thus alienating people who prefer to approach matters based on rationality and science. The other issue is that the two largest religions in the world, Christianity and Islam, in their most mainstream forms, tend to be more ritualistic and even actively combated their more spiritual wings (Gnosticism and Sufism respectively). Thus, while they appropriated the term, they sought to void it of its deepest significance. Sam claims that the individual can live more happily if they practiced meditation, and eventually attained great ""spiritual wisdom"", that only a few have been able to achieve. He believes the experience to be ultimately similar to what can be realized with psychedelics such as LSD, which he suggests as a shortcut to those who are very skeptical about the possibility of such experiences in the first place (though risks do exist as he mentions). This part of his argument is almost impossible to prove rationally, since it is based on personal and circumstantial experience. But Sam insists that one need not attain the final destination to enjoy the journey: meditation can yield benefits, such as increased tranquility and concentration, almost from the start, provided one does practice it regularly."
163,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33428641-andre-stackhouse,Rating 4 out of 5,"At first glance, Waking Up appears to be nothing more than a curious look at Buddhist spirituality through the lens of secular reasoning and neuroscience. Sam Harris is well positioned to write about this as a neuroscience PhD, and based on his experiences on retreat studying and training under eastern spiritual leaders, often for months at a time. He quantifies and qualifies transcendental phenomena, from one end with interesting anecdotes of his own experiences and those of others, and from the other end summarizing studies and our understanding of neurology. If this was all the book had to offer, it would still be a good read.Some may find middle chapters of the book may find the themes and language a bit aloof and esoteric. Not every thought experiment and topic is equally engaging, and truly the most entertaining excerpts are his autobiographical accounts of certain teachers, or drug trips of his youth.However, the book becomes important in the brief moments where Harris argues why he believes all this is important. Today, most people still associate spirituality with religion. Even secular folks still often feel the need to bring in something spooky or pseudo-scientific to understand feelings of enlightenment, near death experiences, and other feelings of ecstasy. Consequently, those who attempt to see the world through the most rational eyes possible, often find themselves having to deny the significance, or even the existence of these feelings. Harris makes the case, and I find myself agreeing, that in order to truly be free of religion, we must cultivate secular alternatives and explanations for these feelings and human needs. This book is his contribution to that endeavor.WARNING: May make reader want to try psychedelics.The first chapter of his book was released in audio-format on his podcast ""Waking Up.""

Of course, there have been spiritual scientists before, like Carl Sagan or Albert Einstein among others, but they often tended to be mystical in their approach and delivery, which is something Harris succeeded in, if I may, demystifying… Maybe it is due to his dual formation of philosopher and scientist, renewing with the lost tradition of the likes of Descartes and Lucretius, in times where one usually always was both – of course there was less science to grasp then, so the task was easier…For Harris, it all started with MDMA… Another success of this great book, is how this prominent intellectual speaks openly about drugs and their powerful role in opening people’s minds. “The “war on drugs” has been lost and should never have been waged”.It is of crucial importance that our society understands that by being spiritual – in a non religious way – they can improve not only their own life but those of other sentient beings, including, of course, the non human animals, and also improve the condition of our environment. It is a subject Sam Harris doesn‘t go too much into details, but, if I may, I would like to add that the logical consequence of spirituality is compassion, and one of the biggest compassionate impact we can have on the world is to boycott animal products, because by doing so we spare countless lives lived in suffering, we save gallons of water and trees, etc, etc, the benefits are too long to list here but worth looking in to.I really hope this marvelous book helps people enter into a better world, for everybody’s sake."
165,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2437049-justin,Rating 2 out of 5,"Sam Harris is like your best friend's annoying older brother who just got back from his first trip abroad and is now an expert in meditation and psychedelics and wants to lecture you little kids about how to live life properly. While there were some interesting and useful nuggets here (mostly in the meditation chapter) the book felt like a meandering narrative through things Harris finds personally interesting and lacked an overall coherency. He has a maddening sense to dismiss entire schools of thought that either a) he had a bad experience with b) he hasn't studied personally himself. So, sorry Zen Buddhism! Sam hasn't practiced Zen meditation so there's likely not much value there, kids. Move along! The chapter on consciousness, the central part of the book, was really confusing to read and the pretentious, page long footnotes certainly didn't help. His anti-religion stance, while well-informed and credibly argued felt a bit too much like preaching to the choir. The relationship between science and spirituality was a potentially really interesting intersection to examine but for me it was never really flushed out and ultimately felt lacking. This is where the meat of the book should have focused on, instead of spending multiple pages picking on easy targets like the scammy ""out of body experience"" author, the author's rather mundane (for the reader) experiences with psychedelic drugs and opinions on random gurus. None of the areas he focused on, including meditation, gurus, drugs and scientific experiences had anything like a rigor or comprehensiveness that one would expect from a ""guide."" For a 200 page book, to hop around so much and never really land an effective punch is pretty damning, and it's surprising the editors didn't provide such feedback to an obviously engaging and talented writer. "
166,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1757271-jason,Rating 3 out of 5,"Unless it's just me, Sam Harris, along with Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins, seems to be better suited to speaking directly to a crowd of gatherers than writing words on a page. That's not to say that what he writes is unclear or badly handled, but simply that I feel he has more potential to make an impression when one can watch and hear him directly. I think that part of this feeling has something to do with all three of these guys being blessed with the good fortune to have attended some of the most celebrated educational institutions in the Western world. Though this is no good reason to eschew their books(which I've read quite a number of), it does open up the possibility that their written words won't strike as strong a chord as their spoken ones, because the language and structures for learning that these guys have been brought up in just isn't the norm for most human beings. Nevertheless, this isn't to suggest that any of these guys don't know what they're talking about, only that the necessary language for their subject matter will largely roll off most of their readers' heads(mine included). Harris here speaks about topics I could hardly dare to broach with some of my peers(such is modern life). In that respect, he's a saviour to me. Psychedelics, what consciousness may be, what it definitely isn't, near-death experience, meditation, the pitfalls of religious thinking. All of these subjects are of intense interest to my wondering mind, and without people like Harris I don't know if ever I might have pursued them. I advise anyone with even a vague interest in any of these to go pick his book up, but if you're looking for something less dense and which might pack more of a wallop, then I suggest you spend a few hours watching him discuss and debate all these topics on Youtube.

The first part is worth 3 or 4 stars, the second 2 or 3, and the final a solid 5. I am absolutely fascinated with the implications of findings such as the split-brain experiment, the results of which I vividly remember encountering for the first time just last year while reading Michio Kaku's ""Future of the Mind."" Michio's angle was focused on technological ways of leveraging this phenomenon while Harris is chiefly concerned with the philosophical ramifications of such findings, namely: is consciousness irreducible if it is divisible?The entirety of chapters 2 and 3—'The Mystery of Consciousness' and 'The Riddle of the Self,' respectively—are worth the price of the book in my mind. I think my subconscious just slipped in a joke about consciousness, actually. The discourses on spirituality aren't insightful or helpful save for a few zingers and well put thoughts. The drug related portion of the last chapter is another curiosity worth discussion. But, once more, all praise has to flow back to chapters 2 and 3—consciousness and the self. For anyone who hasn't heard of the split-brain experiment or read about it in much capacity I'd highly recommend checking this out. Similarly, those who are simply riveted by the idea that there are n-minds residing within your single skull and what sort of implications that may or may not have for the assumptions we all carry around in our daily lives related to the feeling of ""I"" this would be a great pleasure for you to read.If this all sounds whack, inconsequential, or somehow boring then go ahead and skip over this one.

169,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3693309-sarah,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a neuroscientific look at spiritual practices, geared toward non-spiritual people. Harris' goal is to convey the value of certain practices usually seen in a religious environment, stripped of their mythological and supernatural overtones.The book has three sections--a deconstruction of the concept of ""self,"" based heavily on well-documented and well-annotated neuroscience (and, through this deconstruction, an argument that there is no immortal soul to be 'saved,' no persistent consciousness beyond awareness of the immediate moment); a deconstruction of the cult of personality that surrounds many religions (Jesus and Mohammed are obvious examples of this, but he relies on more recent examples of cults in the 70s and 80s, and his own experiences in Buddhist retreats and monastaries); and a surprisingly emotional treatise on the benefits of self-reflection during altered states of consciousness, specifically through psychedelics. I enjoyed this book a lot. Harris is an exhaustive researcher and clear, concise writer, and broke down complicated concepts of neuroscience to the point where an interested novice (this guy!) could follow along easily. The book seems geared toward the angry atheist in the audience--the one who insists that all contemplative and spiritually-oriented self-work is a holdover from a time when we rubbed sticks together to make fire. I'm not as self-righteous as all that, but I enjoyed his keen separation between religious mysticism and the real-world benefits of some spiritual practices, such as reflection, meditation, and mindfulness."

If you follow Sam Harris on internet at all, you know that he's exceptionally skillful in making very persuasive arguments. He does an exceedingly great job at that in the book, as expected. As convincing a job Harris does at making convincing arguments, this book is not about merely persuading the reader. It's about seeding the reader's mind with an idea - an idea that there's a lot more to our minds than we think and it's worthwhile to explore this path to awaken spiritually. Unlike many in the genre, this book isn't about Harris' own spiritual experience alone. Although the book has glimpses of Harris' personal experience, he does a great job at balancing it with the experience of many other spiritual practitioners and gurus which allows the reader to draw from a rich set of experiences. The narrative is that of informing the reader in most parts of the book and persuasive in many others, which I could imagine to be displeasing for a reader opposed to Harris' views. I have to admit that ""new age"" spiritual language makes me squirm and immediately discredit the author as a reader. However to dismiss an idea without exploring it is also unscientific. . Harris' inquiry in spirituality is the most scientific and rational that I've found thus far, and deeply satisfying for any scientific mind as a result. Overall this is an excellent book which I'd recommend to anyone who's open to exploring new ideas - particularly of mindfulness and spirituality. It's a very useful and palatable guide for anyone at any stage of their spiritual journey. I couldn't recommend this book more. "
171,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8709909-natasha-holme,Rating 4 out of 5,"The parts of this book that I felt the need to copy and save:The feeling of ‘I’ arises inside consciousness. Consciousness is prior to it.Consciousness is already free of anything that remotely resembles a self—and there is nothing that you can do, as an illusory ego, to realize this.Consciousness is the prior condition of every experience; the self or ego is an illusory appearance within it; look closely for what you are calling “I,” and the feeling of being a separate self will disappear; what remains, as a matter of experience, is a field of consciousness—free, undivided, and intrinsically uncontaminated by its ever-changing contents.That which is aware of sadness is not sad. That which is aware of fear is not fearful.One of the first things one learns in practicing meditation is that nothing is intrinsically boring—indeed, boredom is simply a lack of attention.Subjectively speaking, there is only consciousness and its contents; there is no inner self who is conscious.Everything we do is for the purpose of altering consciousness.Every waking moment—and even in our dreams—we struggle to direct the flow of sensation, emotion, and cognition toward states of consciousness that we value.Consciousness is the basis of both the examined and the unexamined life. It is all that can be seen and that which does the seeing. No matter how far you have traveled from the place of your birth, and however much you now understand about the world, you have been exploring consciousness and its changes. Why not do so directly?"
172,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63497622-ioana,Rating 1 out of 5," 2014, Falling asleepsnoring soundsTowards the end of the book we find out what its purpose was: ”Spirituality remains the huge gap in secularism, rationalism, atheism and all the other defensive positions taken by rational men and women in face of irrational faith.” This seems like a difficult endeavor for any pacifier. I would assert that the proponent of this spiritual way must come with some original suggestions, a highly coherent worldview and little to no concern on the drawbacks of other religions (granted, some pages might be needed). After all, the latter would be discussed more fittingly in a history book. So, what are you, the person that claims to be able to “guide” others through the process, have to offer and why should anyone buy into it?The prebuttal -the first 70 pages- is fully drenched in truisms. The part on consciousness is marginally interesting, with Harris giving some insights on the sectioning of the corpus callosum, which seems to elicit different responses from the 2 hemispheres of the brain (split-brain). Some (very few) tips on meditation are again interesting, but tend to get lost in an amalgamation of bad writing, truisms, infantile analogies and idiotic advice.Readers that want to bask in the rays of spirituality are pushed to go to “war” with believers. Not worth it. And why would it be? Certainly TV wars and self referentiality don’t count. Jean Francois Revel (The Monk and the Philosopher) was right to say spirituality without transcendence is useless. And this is exactly the type of credo Harris puts forth."
173,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/911636-j,No Rating,"I like how Harris brings intellectual rigor to subjects like consciousness and the self that usually are presented in softer treatments. I think it sets his book apart.People a bit familiar with his books and blog posts might be impressed like I was that he spent a couple years on retreats with gurus in his own explorations. Some quotations that stood out to me:Chapter 1, 54 min 30 sec (audio book)As manuals for contemplative understanding, the Bible and the Quran are worse than useless. Whatever wisdom can be found in their pages is never best found there, and it is subverted time and again by ancient savagery and superstition.C2 4 min 44 secTo say that consciousness may only seem to exist from the inside is to admit its existence in full. For if things seem any way at all, that is consciousness. Even if I happen to be a brain in a vat at this moment – all my memories are false, and all my perceptions are of a world that does not exist – the fact that I am having an experience is indisputable, to me, at least. This is all that is required for me or any other sentient being to fully establish the reality of consciousness. Consciousness is the one thing in this universe that cannot be an illusion.C2 33min 00 secHowever, the most important implications are for our view of consciousness. It is divisible, and therefore more fundamental than any apparent self.C6 1 min 11 secMost people still believe that religion provides something essential that cannot be had any other way."
174,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27775723-jake,Rating 2 out of 5,"Well-written, interesting in some respects, but ultimately very disappointing. Harris's explanations of meditation and its benefits were concise, and the section on the illusion of the 'self' was interesting. But I can't help but notice how much of the content of the book was either unnecessary or rehashed.Essentially the entire chapter on psychedelic drugs (admittedly, this was one aspect of the book that I was really looking forward to) was his essay 'Drugs and the Meaning of Life.' It's a great essay, but he couldn't have gone into greater detail regarding his transformative psychedelic experiences instead of dedicating a relatively large section of the book to the strange and immoral activities of so-called gurus?What most annoyed me was how little Harris stuck to the title. Waking Up isn't really a guide to spirituality without religion, it's more of an overview. I kept getting further and further into the book, waiting for some semblance of a guide, but nothing of the sort ever came. If you're new to meditation, some of the thoughts could be helpful, but there are far better books out there (Mindfulness in Plain English comes to mind). Honestly, I would recommend listening to the first chapter (the audio is available for free on his website, and it is, in my opinion, the best part of the book), reading his essay 'Drugs and the Meaning of Life', and if you're a beginner interested in meditation, read Mindfulness in Plain English and/or Mindfulness by Joseph Goldstein. "
175,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Interesting justification of the doctrines of Theravada Buddhism from the perspective of modern neuroscience and psychology. Harris defines ""spirituality"" as the exploration of the contents of consciousness. Spiritual humans are able to dispassionately observe thoughts, pains, itches as they arise and disappear. These contents of consciousness are also familiar in Western thought: they are Santayana's ""essences,"" and Plato's phainomena. The distinction that Harris emphasizes, using various metaphors, is that between being in the grip of a pain, and observing, from a distance, as it were, that there is a pain in my field of awareness. It is the difference between being lost in the world of, say, a movie, and realizing that you are watching a play of images across the screen. In the Buddhist metaphor, the one who is in the grip of the phenomena is asleep, while the one who observes the phenomena as the transitory forms they are is awake.I'm not sure how well the book hits its target. The writing is fine, but feels more dutiful than inspired. It veers between relatively arcane references to the scientific literature and personal stories about LSD trips. I have personally always found the idea of a Self to be somewhat illusory, so I didn't need much convincing. Others probably have such a strong sense of a permanent Self that no amount of argument will do. For me, then, the book hammered on a point that needed no hammering, while others will likely feel unconvinced. Any book that covers this terrain will likely encounter the same difficulties, I imagine."

I feel like the title and blurb describing it make the book seems as though it's going to have a scope that's bigger than it really is. The bulk of the book's ""guide"" really relates to just one thing: meditation. The last chapter offers a few quick mentions of some other, quicker roads toward exploring spirituality but meditation is the main thrust of the book. As such, it tends to be a bit repetitive, as Harris makes his point again and again, using different examples and some background info to further explain it. That being said, Harris offers his point of view on how one can be spiritual without getting trapped in all the more fantastic elements that surround a lot of belief systems. I found this interesting, and some of the science he uses to illustrate his points is intriguing. I imagine if someone were particularly well-versed in Buddhist meditation or the science of the brain, this might not have been as intriguing a book. But, only knowing a little about each topic, it kept me listening. For the audiobook, I will say Harris's narration style can be so laid back that it's not always easy to not drift away from what he's saying.Above all that, I certainly appreciate the author's view that one could lead a reason-filled life and not eschew a sense of spirituality entirely. That this book is so short and the scope so narrow may only reflect the author's view that the viable roads of spiritual discovery are few."
177,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4983981-ben-pace,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book, or extended monograph, could be read in a roughly 5 hour sitting. Harris attempts to explain why he thinks spirituality is important, as clearly as he can. Most Eastern works about the subject, consciousness, meditation, and mindfulness, are remarkably opake and often appears meaningless except for those who are experienced meditators. Harris attempts to bridge the gap, and while it still felt a unclear, it seemed like a world away from typical Buddhist and Eastern writings, by which I mean much more understandable.I think his most powerful argument was that meditation can bring about transformative experiences, and that paying attention to your conscious experience can have very positive value on your life. It is something that I will look into further, and I imagine a lot of the book will be much more understandable after practicing meditation.The book often didn't have a strong sense of direction, and the meandering sections on neuroscience and philosophy of mind were fairly unpersuasive. However, I'm not quite sure that I'm in the demographic Harris is aiming at; his book feels as though it's trying to move people from 'I'm not sure about whether I believe in religion or dualism' to 'I do not believe in religion or dualism, but I think that I can have incredible spiritual experiences'. I'm fairly confident about my position wrt the former, and so much of it missed me. I could've received equal value from a possibly much shorter extract."

Then he (my husband) bought me ""Waking Up"" as a holiday gift. I'm glad I own it, because it's one of those books I'd like to read again. It's a testament to how well my husband knows me that the book is a perfect match for my temperament and interests. Harris offers a lifeline to those of us who crave something in our lives beyond the quotidian but who simply can't give ourselves over to a higher power. Harris is a brilliant polemicist who leads readers step by step through some very complex arguments. My head is still exploding from encountering the concept that I have no head, but I'm hoping that spending the rest of my life in meditative contemplation will allow me to come to terms with the idea. In chapters covering spirituality, consciousness, the self, meditation, and ""gurus, death, drugs, and other puzzles,"" Harris leads the reader through a fascinating and consciousness-expanding exploration of what it means to be human.Given the current schism (gulf, chasm, yawning canyon?) between the religious and the secular, I doubt that anyone who isn't already predisposed to the idea of spirituality without religion will be able to stomach this book. But for those of us who are, it proves an indispensable guide to an alternative path to transformative experience. "
179,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5031983-ron,Rating 3 out of 5,"This first chapter was pretty solid, but I think the rest can be skimmed without missing too much. Essentially, Buddhist meditation allows us to explore our sense of identity and what it means to be conscious beings. Other contemplative practices, e.g. prayer, can do the same thing, which is probably one of the things that has helped religion stay so popular all these years. Since Buddhism at its core involves no gods or commandments in the Mosaic sense, we can apply its practices without compromising our existing beliefs, whatever those may be. After the first chapter, the book loses steam. Harris spends the next hundred pages trying to convince the reader that whatever the reader thinks of as ""me"" is an illusion created by the brain to create a sense of cohesion and agency. If you keep up on your pop-neuroscience, this probably isn't that hard to accept, so I think it would make sense to move on to the practical part of the book and experience this for ourselves. Except there is no practice here. Around page 150, Harris says that to properly learn meditation you should seek out a qualified teacher. It seems a bit dishonest to call this book a Guide when the key piece of advice is to look for advice elsewhere. I would like to give Harris credit, though, for at least considering that religion isn't just a scam or mass delusion. Religion has done a lot of good for a lot of people. But it also comes with a lot of baggage, and not everybody's okay with that. "

Unfortunately (if you can call it such), Harris also doesn't appear to assume a depth of stupidity in his audience, unlike so many others who discuss spirituality. This book requires a decent minimal grasp of psychology, philosophy and some of the considerations concerning the nature of self. Without it, the book is still excellent but may lose many. No doubt, like other of his works, there will be any number of people who don't understand what he said, refuse to understand and gleefully cherry-pick quotes to make their hatred justifiable. However, if you take the time to go through, are willing to question even that most cherished of ego-consoling subjects called the ""indivisible self"" and want to broaden your understanding of reality, then reading ""Waking Up"" will not steer you wrong. There is here a great deal of Harris's personal journey, told humbly and without pretension, as a reflective guide to opening up our solitary vision of experience. Question your assumptions, practice the meditation recommended, and begin to wake up."

In short, Harris's argument is that faith is not a precondition for some spiritual practices (such as meditation), which does not place these pursuits in conflict with scientific principles. Harris also does a great job explaining meditation, the science behind it, and ways to do it; indeed, I found his explanations more understandable than those of the celebrity practitioners. Lastly, I was very pleased to see that he discussed the relationship between pharmacology (read: psychedelics) and spiritual insights. Again, his treatment of this issue was refreshingly honest and thoughtful, and not reactionary.---Second read: The second read was as good as the first - probably because I had actually forgotten most of what I had read only last year (typical of me). This time I was more interested in what Harris had to say about the nature of consciousness, but I worry that I do not have the intellectual horsepower (nor the time to slowly read and digest everything he has written) to fully understand the arguments presented about the nature of consciousness. Enjoyable nonetheless. "

Gravity is a mystery. People are stilltrying to figure it out.”This type of answer continues to divide humanity. We could have said, asbillions of people would have, “Gravity comes from God.” But this would havemerely stifled our daughter’s intelligence—and taught her to stifle it. We couldhave told her, “Gravity might be God’s way of dragging people to hell, wherethey burn in fire. And you will burn there forever if you doubt that God exists.”No Christian or Muslim can offer a compelling reason why we shouldn’t havesaid such a thing—or the moral equivalent—and yet that would have beennothing less than the emotional and intellectual abuse of a child. I have nowheard from many thousands of people who were oppressed in this way, from themoment they could speak, by the terrifying ignorance and fanaticism of theirparents.

And maybe this is the point, or maybe I'm not ready for it, but it just doesn't quite resonate with me yet.I'm down with a number of Harris's idea in general. The profundity of consciousness.. consciousness is truly the miracle of existence. There's something spiritual about life, for sure. He brought in some interesting examples about how different aspects of our consciousness / subjectivity are controlled by specific parts of the brain..I wish he dug deeper into what a modern lived experience might feel like in which I have come to recognize the selflessness of consciousness and made my goal to continue to ""wake up"".It was a bit of a slow & bumpy read for me at this point in my spiritual journey.

By no means a comprehensive treatise on the subject, ""Waking Up"" serves as an excellent entry point to those curious about the nature of consciousness, and its altered states whether induced by psychedelics or by the practiced employment of meditation techniques. The book shows a middles path, one that neither espouses incredulous claims of the religious bent of mind, nor one that completely abandons the notion of spirituality as peripheral to the methods of science, and this is where it shines brightest by boldly wading confidently through the murky waters until now infested mainly by charlatans and godmen.While ""Waking Up"" briefly touches upon the techniques of spirituality, and many of those techniques have been described in detail by Sam elsewhere, it merely serves, as the author himself admits, as a conversation starter about the nature of our consciousness without having to take anything unsubstantiated on faith.

Harris touts it as a ""guide to spirituality without religion"" but I feel that's misleading. If you're looking for deep, spiritual insights here, you won't find them. Instead, Harris provides fascinating thoughts about consciousness and its meaning. This book is less about providing profound answers, more about getting you to think about the questions.Harris maintains that there is no such thing as a soul, and that even the very concept of the ""self"" is an illusion. In the first couple chapters, he talks about how the brain functions (Harris is a neuroscientist) and affects our consciousness. In the middle of the book, he discusses meditation and his years spent studying Buddhism in the east. Finally, he discusses how drugs can alter our perception of reality and our very consciousnesses.If you ever wondered exactly what consciousness means, what it means to be YOU, this book won't solve that mystery--but it'll provide some fascinating information and get you thinking about the topic from some new angles."

I have also been struggling with religions. I was excited to read this book to further my journey toward mediation, I was disappointed with it though. Part of my disappointment is probably because I had preconceived notions of what this book would bring to me. I was hoping for a guide to spirituality and what I found was more a guide from religion.Harris shared some to his quest for spirituality without really guiding me anywhere. He also shared the experiences of others with charlatan gurus, others accounts of their near death experiences, and his experiences with hallucinogens. My question is' ""How is this supposed to guide me anywhere?""He did offer a couple of basic instructions but no path to find a practical ""how to guide"" which is what I was hoping to find.I am still on my quest toward mediation with little help from this book."

And because of that it was surprising to me that he did not put more effort into overcoming the resistance that he must have known would exist to this rather sharp departure from his usual, rational, logical arguments and proposals.It saddens me to think that I might have been more inclined to try the things he suggests if only he had done a better job of delineating the benefits to the average person.

192,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1848870-tom,Rating 4 out of 5,"Sam Harris has a background that seems ideally suited to the subtitle of this book. He has a degree in philosophy and a PhD in neuroscience and, it becomes clear as well, that his interest in meditation as a means of acquiring spiritual insights began as early as his teen years. His disenchantment with organized religion as a means of spiritual enlightenment is clear as he views that religious doctrines have always tended to become dangerous due to dogma and “…yet there is more to understanding the human condition than science and secular culture generally admit.”(p6) He sets out then, to explore spiritual phenomena, concepts and practices within the context of newer understandings of how the human mind works. He recognizes that trying to bridge the gap between science and spirituality has been made difficult by one of two mistakes: scientists generally have an impoverished view of spiritual experiences and ‘new age’ writers tend to draw connections between subjective experiences and the “…spookier theories on the frontiers of physics.”He says that most scientists and philosophers are most likely to not have developed strong skills of introspection, what Schumacher in Guide for the Perplexed called the first field of knowledge. Meditation confirms some insights about the human mind from science: “Our conventional sense of self is an illusion; positive emotions such as compassion and patience, are teachable skills; and the way we think directly influences our experience of the world.” (p8) We are not our thoughts and the work of meditation is to make clear that the self is not the stream of thinking that occupies our minds most of the time. “Being mindful is not a matter of thinking more clearly about experience; it is the act of experiencing more clearly, including the arising of thoughts themselves.” (p36) “The problem is not thoughts themselves but the state of thinking without knowing we are thinking.” (p37)There is a tightly written chapter on what is meant by consciousness. My understanding is that he takes an agnostic stand on whether the mind is reducible to the brain alone (i.e. reductionist view). “The fact that the universe is illuminated where you stand-that your thoughts and moods and sensations have a qualitative character in this moment-is a mystery, exceeded only by the mystery that there should be something rather than nothing in the first place.” (p79)I found that the chapter on meditation took careful reading. He begins that chapter saying that neuroscience and psychology acknowledge that the human mind tends to wander, engaging in “stimulus independent thought.” The more you reflect on that statement, the more obvious it becomes. We are lost in a cacophony of thoughts that flit around all day and into the night sometimes. The point of meditation is recognize that this is happening, not to judge the thoughts, but to simply acknowledge this stream of consciousness. When the brain is in this wandering mode, it is in a default mode or resting state and activity is predominately in the midline regions. This default mode network (DMN) is linked to our capacity for self-representation; when we make judgements of relevance about ourselves as opposed to making them about other people; and when we evaluate a scene from the first person (rather than third-person) point of view. This last point becomes relevant when he later describes a meditative practice known as Dzogchen. I found this section took some time to begin to understand. Emotions too are considered as objects of thought: “That which is aware of sadness is not sad. That which is aware of fear is not fearful. The moment I am lost in thought, however, I’m as confused as anyone else.” (p137)Harris also looks at the role of psychedelics in stimulating altered levels of consciousness. Having tried them himself, he argues that they need to be used with great caution, but can demonstrate that the human mind is capable of a great variety of subjective experience. He makes room for the possibility that those who are adept at meditation may also have such experiences, though that need not be the purpose of meditation, which can benefit even those who will never achieve advanced meditative states. Here he offers an sports analogy. We know that some humans are capable of running at great speeds or over long distances; perform great athletic feats and so on, but most of us can’t do those things, yet we can benefit from exercise. Similarly, we can all benefit from whatever level of meditation we can achieve.In his conclusion he returns to why he feels that organized religion has failed to advance spirituality. He considers questions such as the meaning of life or our purpose on earth to be false questions that religions have claimed to answer. “We need not answer them, for they are badly posed, but we can live our answers all the same. At a minimum, we can create the conditions for human flourishing in this life..” (p202) The benefits of organized religions such as charity, compassion, community, ritual and the contemplative life do not require accepting rigid dogma. Here I found the book fails to adequately explain how ethical values emerge from meditation. He seeks space to consider spirituality in rational terms…”A middle path exists between making religion out of spiritual life and having no spiritual life at all.” (p205). He concludes: “Spirituality begins with a reverence for the ordinary that can lead us to insights and experiences that are anything but ordinary.” (p206)I have a small shelf full of books on meditation and have attempted to include it in my daily routine. In the past that has lasted for a few months only. After reading this book, I have reintroduced it as a daily practice. I think it was the inclusion of recent neuroscience findings, some of which I was aware of and others were new, that made this book feel more ‘grounded’ to me than was true of many of the others. "
193,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/873902-ryan,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book does a good job describing the benefits of a good spiritual practice that is primarily based on Buddhist mindfulness meditation and is free of supernaturalism. If you already meditate and have no need for gods/spirits/supernatural nonsense, this book won't have a whole lot of new stuff for you. But Harris does contribute to the discussion by including some scientific confirmation of Buddhist claims. And it's nice to have Harris bring his rationalism to the topic of being ""spiritual but not religious."" The book should pique the interest of people who are considering doing more mindfulness meditation. And it's a decent intro to some meditation practices. There are better intros to Buddhist practices out there. And this book really dragged at times. Still, it's probably worth reading."
194,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21795785-colleen,Rating 1 out of 5,"I almost didn't pick up this book, as I've always found Sam Harris to be the least insightful of the ""new atheist"" crowd, but I decided to give it a chance because I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about non-religious, non-supernatural spirituality. I should have gone with my original instinct. While I could get into specific quibbles about the points he makes (such as the irrational firmness of his conclusions that consciousness in irreducible and self is non-existent), my main problems with the book are simply that it presents nothing original, and doesn't even organize old information in a more accessible or interesting way. If you are interested in consciousness, spirituality, or Buddhist meditation (as this is really the only practice he discusses) I'd recommend going elsewhere. "

That's not it at all. Harris is over the top into meditation. I dabbled with Transcendental Meditation in college but nothing like this. Harris has been on long pilgrimages to India, Nepal, Tibet, to study under the great gurus. He knows everything about the spiritual notion of self and consciousness, zen Buddhism stuff. He really delves deeply into it, in scientific neurological detail, way over my head and level of interest. Some parts are interesting and some parts are dull. Towards the end he gets into a discussion of psychedelic drugs. In the conclusion he does denigrate religion, but not necessarily from the point of view of an atheist."

Harris actually makes the two come together convincingly through a skillful argument about the nature of the self and reality. On the other hand, if you don't already care about the philosophy of subjective experience, you probably won't be impressed. It's a fact that most people actually have a spiritual side, and much of the social world still rests on religious foundations. So this is a really important book on a societal level. It's the first one I will now bring up with people who say science and spirituality can't mix, or spiritual experiences are distractions, or science is just another way of seeing the world. "

One of the rare books that make you pause reading every now and then to reflect on the profundity of what you just read. I have mixed feelings about Sam Harris - his thinking is clear as a crystal, his eloquence has a quality of poetic beauty and his thirst for ""knowledge"" is something I can deeply empathise with. But as is wont with many philosophers, he can often get stuck into his own viewpoint, making bumptious and condescending statements to support his opinion. My only quibble is that chapter five about fake teachers felt like an incongruous tangent - both in tone and content. The analysis on pharmacological catalysts that induce varying states of consciousness, was a great read in the same chapter though. The book in itself is definitely worth multiple reads. "

I kept putting the book down thinking perhaps I was not in the proper “mind space” to relate, absorb, or have epiphany moments. However, I found every time I picked the book back up, I was met with the same inability to connect. With the exception of the exhaustive split brain experimental exercises and hypotheses, I did not learn anything new. Although, I did find the split brain info interesting but learned more about it by putting the book down and googling the information.I am not 100% sure what I was looking other than “a scientific and philosophic exploration of the self, and a how-to-guide for transcendence”. This book did not deliver this to me and I am unwilling to explore any mind/mood alternating drugs described in this book in an attempt to “get it”."

Osittain tämä kuulosti jopa esoterialta, mutta kirjoittajan vahva disclamer tätä ajatusta vastaan kirjan alussa antoi kuitenkin luottoa siihen, että asiasta puhutaan. "
201,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was inspired by Sam Harris' talk to pick this book up and the discussion on consciousness. The book is a 200 paged read, but packs a lot of content to ruminate on. Trust me, several chapters the readers have to actually think of it as a thought experiment. But the read is quite slow, the language is quite high at certain places, anecdotes are mostly facilitated towards the western audience. The language of the book seems to be written from a firm Western mindset which makes sweeping statements at many chapters without considering different perspectives. Additionally the consulted references are majority Western philosophers and their ideologies on the east than delving directly into the eastern texts or how consulting historians and religious scholars from other sections of society. This seems to be a poor choice in forming the whole narrative. I do feel the whole book was crystallized from some personal ideologies and the author seemed to have sourced confirming theories to fit his narrative. So readers are cautioned that this is a perspective of 'a individual', some ideas are quite rational and supported well with experimental claims and fuels the thinking brain while others are very wishy-washy.Disclaimer! If you plan to read the book stop here. Below are some criticisms about the narrative and ideas which had spoiled book for me. ------------------x---------------------First few chapters of the book on rationalizing why religion needs to die, seems sloppy. The intent and deliberation are mostly based on author's first hand experience and subjective analysis of religious ideologies which are not at any least compelling but rather annoying. One of the jarring conclusions in the first chapter was that the author tries to draw parallels between eastern and western societies in terms of producing better societies. Since West discovered Science, western societies are better than eastern societies without considering the almost whole of eastern societies were at one point or other ruled by or under suppression for long periods, also without considering the eastern perspective. Science as a tool was used to facilitate the early 1600 century sailors and merchants for better travel and transport aided by the church which helped it to spread its gospels across the world. The eastern societies had their fare share of inventions in medicine, engineering, paper making, rockets, ink, clothing, cooking using spices (triggered whole race for trade), silk etc. The stories of eastern thinking and philosophies and its scientific and engineering skills are not well documented and much talked about due to the conquests and destruction. This has been conveniently left out the whole discussion.If the reader has managed not to throw the book away and gone well past few chapters, then some interesting scientific experiments and personal retelling of drug usage stories and the link to the conscious awareness begin to surface. Finally the reader begins to understand where the whole mess of the different subjects connects to. In the chapter 'Riddle of self' the author tries to support the claim of Sartre that 'self' is formed in the presence of another observer. The author doesn't try to distinguish between the formation of 'self' as a personal narrative as a continuum from the conscious awareness of others to the bodily self. To this, if we consider a thought experiment of a baby born in space without any adjacent humans in contact like in an incubator, then does the baby form a concept of 'self' or is it just aware of its conscious surroundings without any mental models.In the chapter 'Gurus, death, drugs and other puzzles' the author vehemently lashes out on the Indian guru who had ice cream for breakfast. It's quite interesting but it seems that the author doesn't understand the concept of food as considered by the west is not the same in the east. A person who doesn't know Western etiquette of dining will seldom think ice cream should not be had for breakfast is it not? Further he tries to shell out his frustration in not being able to find a definitive strategy to find a meditation master who is genuine and not troublesome or immoral. This is vivid from this other examples of gurus and their life choices and moral behavior. a) The author fails to understand that illiterate man is not compensated by his spirituality. The author forgets his own arguments in the riddle of self , as to how people's mental models of society are based on their interactions with others. The more you explore the more thought and information you put into your conscious awareness extending your mental arenas to compensate for the diverse spectrum of people.b) The enlightened person can choose to behave as he likes as he isn't bound by societal laws or rather shuns it completely. The outcomes of violating them does not bother them. Hence asking for such people to abide by the laws of one's society seems an invalid attempt. Another overlooked idea is the author fails to analyze if near-death experience (NDE) has some connection to hallucinations. Hallucination as a topic (without drugs) is completely missed out, which is not only important in understanding how brain interprets data when the sensory circuit is scrambled or how false signal/noise signals disrupts brain's pattern forming modules to create vivid life-like images. Instead the NDE stories of patients and the neurosurgeon Eben Alexander seems to be invalidated due to lack of proof. And a more vague comparison drawn between NDE and LSD experiences (from the author's personal encounter). Finally, does the book deserve a read, my answer would be yes. There are some thoughts and experiments which I did not encounter in other books. However, this book needs to be heavily critiqued for some major flaws and some biases."

Do not be deceived by this slim volume: This is a dense read, thick with philosophy and neuroscience. Even with my minor in philosophy and interest in neuroscience, I struggled with a lot of the concepts in this book. But the effort has brought me a new understanding of the mind that is absolutely life-changing. In my early 20s, I embraced skepticism, and my life has been nearly void of spirituality in the intervening decade. Thanks to this book, my mind has been opened to new possibilities, and I've rediscovered my personal spirituality."

There were many valuable insights that I will remember for the rest of my life and try to implement. However, I think if one is already an atheist practicing meditation--then this book will not present anything new to you, besides Sam Harris's personal experiences. I feel like the book also has an undertone of all-knowingness that Sam Harris himself condemns. He speaks on many topics with absolutism, while at the same time assuring the readers that he is the most open-minded person in the world. The best parts are towards the end and I appreciated him speaking about the implications of teaching negative aspects of religion to children and I wish the conclusion hadn't been so short."

Han forteller om sine ""spirituelle"" opplevelser (her er betydningen av spirituell ikke lik overnaturlige, men heller mer i betydningen ""selv-utforskende""). Han forklarer om meditasjon, sine opplevelser, og innsikter han har fått. Til slutt forteller han litt om hvordan LSD og andre psykedelika kan ""hjelpe til"" (og at en bør være skeptisk til innsikter en får når en ""tripper""). Veldig artig og interessant bok. Spesielt avsnittet om splittet hjerne-pasienter som ser ut til å ha to forskjellige bevisstheter (én i hver hjernehalvdel) var veldig interessant å lese om."

It was packed with so much information and topics to ponder that I will be returning to it in the future. I highly recommend it if you aren't afraid to read something from an author who thinks that religion does more harm than good in the world, but highly values spiritual experiences, which can be obtained without religion or dogma.

I'm all in on Harris (love the Waking Up meditation app and his podcast), but this book, the second time through, wasn't as meaningful to me. Seemed like his conclusions often weren't fully baked or explained. Probably 3.5 stars. ***************************2019 ReviewThis was a very thought-provoking book. I appreciate Harris's intensity and apparent sincerity: it really does seem like he's just trying to get to the truth, discarding things that don't make sense. (Shouldn't we all be doing the same?) Religion, as you could guess from the title, takes a big hit in this book, one I'm not sure it can overcome. His immense personal experience with contemplative practices was fabulous."

I am an atheist interested in the power of mindfulness and the whole world of so-called spirituality, so naturally, I am the ideal audience that Sam Harris is looking for. But it disappointed in almost every domain that I had expectations in. Using deep-sounding difficult words and wrapping them in an almost mythical aura of ""Consciousness"", this one was a huge letdown. The irony is that I've been following his mindfulness meditation course and it's been the opposite experience there - in fact, his meditation course itself was what motivated me to pick up this book. Save yourself the trouble of reading on why to meditate and instead dive into doing the practice itself and judge for yourself."

Basically I feel disappointed that there really isn't much new in the book. The upside is that it has led me back to meditation. This was a vital part of my life for many years and I've slacked off but now feel inspired. So that in itself might satisfy the author rather than anything else I have to say. I don't know if there is a definitive way to describe exactly what ""consciousness"" is but he gives it a worthy try. He does seem to value his own opinions very highly and I had a little trouble with that. If the contents are new to some readers then I think this could be quite an important book. "

That being said, Harris makes a strong case for the value of meditation and ""spiritual"" inquiry in life. It is clear throughout that the author has an axe to grind with religion. While I don't disagree this his argument, I did feel that the text would occasionally get lost on a tangent of anti-religiosity. There is a great deal in this book to expand the understanding of those interested in meditation as novices, as well as being a good refresher for those of us who have developed a practice."

I didn't know what that word meant when I started reading, and halfway through, I had to go back and look it up.It seems like he defines Spirituality is the belief that there's something more to the universe than what's explained by physics. Harris dances around this issue a bit. I think that after reading this book, I would shy away from describing myself as ""spiritual"".The thing that bothered me was that Harris wants to be a skeptic, but he also deeply, deeply wants consciousness to be special. This second belief makes him say some weird stuff.If you're interested in a primer on meditation. I'd recommend Search Inside Yourself instead."

He has a rational view of religion and a level-headed view of hallucinogenic drugs and their ability to offer a kick start into the self exploration provided by meditation. But these drugs come with considerable baggageyet their use might be warranted for those willing to take the risk.

Something the old me, the pre-60 days of silent retreat Chetan, would have gravitated towards. Sam Harris tries to explain the Buddhist path scientifically. While it is a refreshing scientific perspective that makes you want to give meditation a try. To me, this was rather uninspiring."

259,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7198893-jonathan-karmel,Rating 3 out of 5,"Another book by an atheist Jewish Buddhist (Jubu), like Dan Harris, Daniel Goleman, Jon Kabat-Zinn and Allen Ginsburg. I come from the same background as these guys, and I’m sympathetic to their way of thinking. But I find it odd and ironic that Sam Harris is essentially trying to proselytize, as if his chosen lifestyle is a good fit for everyone. This book is very similar to Why Buddhism is True, by Robert Wright; it is also preaching the gospel of “secular Buddhism.”To his credit, Sam Harris acknowledges that a number of yogis, self-styled Buddhists, and gurus are fruitcakes. For example, some yogis apparently lengthen their tongues by cutting their frenulum, because they believe that they can then use their tongue to plug up the nostrils while imbibing subtle liquors that emanate directly from the brain. Likewise, Sam Harris would be the first to debunk the claims of New Age healers and people who have claimed to have near-death experiences, although he seems to be somewhat sympathetic to those who claim to have had out-of-body experiences. Harris castigates Tibetan lama Chogyam Trungpa, who at times acted like a violent drunk and philanderer (which didn’t stop Allen Ginsberg from continuing to revere him).But the bulk of the book is to advocate for the type of meditation that comes from India and China and that is part of yoga: spending time trying to banish all thoughts from your mind and to get as close as possible to not doing or thinking anything and “just being.” Usually, people begin to learn how to do this by meditating on one single thing such as the person’s breath, or a mantra, or a feeling of compassion, but the ultimate goal (I think) is to be able to have no thoughts at all and to just experience unvarnished consciousness.The main focus of this book is the assertion that the “self” is an illusion, and a person can only experience pure consciousness by learning how to let go of the false belief in the “self.”I liked Chapter 2, “The Mystery of Consciousness.” No scientist or philosopher to date has ever been able to explain the mystery of consciousness. Harris writes that “by virtue of some physical property or process, consciousness itself springs, or staggers, into being. This idea seems to me not merely strange but perfectly mysterious. That doesn’t mean it isn’t true. When we linger over the details, however, this notion of emergence seems merely a placeholder for a miracle.” Somewhat odd language from an atheist with no faith. Harris also states “the reality of consciousness appears irreducible. Only consciousness can know itself-and directly, through first-person experience. It follows, therefore, that rigorous introspection-‘spirituality’ in the widest sense of the term-is an indispensable part of understanding the nature of the mind.”The left and right sides of your brain are connected by the corpus callosum. If the corpus callosum is removed, your left and right brains will function independently, and one will not know what the other is thinking. The person, using their left brain, can express frustration that the person is unaware of what the right brain knows or thinks; the right brain can’t communicate but can act based on knowledge that the left brain is unaware of. The right brain continues to feel emotions, but the person, communicating with their left brain, speaks as if the person had no emotions (alexithymia). If your child looked and sounded as if they were sad, your right brain would notice, and you might reach out with your left hand to give your child a hug, but, using your left brain, you would not be able to use words to explain why you were doing so, and you might state that you did not even recognize the person you were about to hug. The author believes that this demonstrates that consciousness is divisible.Consciousness is also selfless, according to Harris. Harris states that he has spent many years practicing meditation, the purpose of which is to cut through the illusion of the self. “Spirituality” consists of realizing this. When Harris states that he believes there is no self, he is saying that a person’s subjective state, the thing a person calls “I,” is at all times subject to change; it changes throughout life; there actually is no thing “inside” your body or inside your brain. Harris also points out that a person with strong feelings of empathy (theory of mind) may feel like something is happening to them when it is actually happening to someone else.Harris discusses methods that to me seemed the same as cognitive behavioral therapy or Stoicism, to point out that a person can choose to have different thoughts and beliefs and therefore have different emotions. Harris believes that through meditation a person can train himself to identify a thought as soon as a thought arises and then to detach from the thought. He believes a person’s sense of “self” is based upon a person’s being “lost in thought.” Once you learn to detach from your thoughts, which really aren’t “you,” you’re just left with pure consciousness, which is the only thing that really exists. Harris believes that the self is like an optical illusion; it appears to be there but it really isn’t.Scientific studies have shown that meditation changes a person’s brain activity (even when they’re not meditating). Through meditation, people can train their minds not to react to situations with negative emotions such as fear, anger, and sadness. Harris believes that through meditation, people can reach an enlightened state in which they become closer to experiencing pure consciousness without any attachment to a belief in their “self.” Many people hope to gradually reach this state through meditation. On the other hand, paradoxically, the only way a person can reach this state is to banish from their mind the thought that: I have a goal of wanting to become enlightened. Therefore, some gurus believe in “sudden” enlightenment, which may take place without any need to spend time meditating. A person could just suddenly come to understand what Harris is talking about and say “voila, I just became enlightened.” On the other hand, if the person is just thinking about the concept of being enlightened, that’s not the same as being enlightened, which is the capability not to have any thoughts at all.H. W. L. Pooja (“Poonjaji” or “Papaji”), a disciple of Ramana Maharshi, is a revered Indian sage. He was a believer in sudden enlightenment, and he had a profound influence on Harris. Dzogchen is a concept in Tibetan Buddhism that means self-transcendence. It is like when you suddenly see what has been in your blind spot your whole life. In the teachings of Dzogchen, it is often said that thoughts and emotions arise in consciousness the way that images appear on the surface of a mirror. We go through life seeing only the images on the mirror, but those images are nothing; the mirror itself is the actual thing. Your thoughts are fleeting; they are not “you.” Or imagine looking through a window without realizing that you could see your own reflection if you looked at the window a different way. The deep purpose of meditation is to recognize that which is common to all states of experience, both pleasant and unpleasant. The goal is to realize those qualities that are intrinsic to consciousness in every present moment, no matter what arises to be noticed. There is no “you” behind your eyes looking out at the world of objects. See On Having No Head, by Douglas Harding. If I apprehend the “nonduality of consciousness,” I will realize that there is no “me”; this is the selflessness of consciousness. I will accept the present moment as it is (to me this seemed similar to what Eckhart Tolle calls the “power of now”).Harris has spent many hours, days, and months meditating and traveling to places like India and Nepal to learn the secrets of enlightenment from gurus.Harris thinks that taking drugs can be a catalyst to reaching enlightenment. “I found psilocybin and LSD to be indispensable tools, and some of the most important hours of my life were spent under their influence.” Harris also thinks he benefited from taking MDMA (ecstasy). “These chemicals disclose layers of beauty that art is powerless to capture and for which the beauty of nature itself is a mere simulacrum. It is one thing to be awestruck by the sight of a giant redwood and amazed at the details of its history and underlying biology. It is quite another to spend an apparent eternity in egoless communion with it.”Once one recognizes the selflessness of consciousness, the practice of meditation becomes just a means of getting more familiar with it. The form of transcendence that appears to link directly to ethical behavior and human well-being is that which occurs in the midst of ordinary waking life. Until we can talk about spirituality in rational terms-acknowledging the validity of self-transcendence-our world will remain shattered by dogmatism. This book is Harris’ attempt to begin such a conversation. And by the way, we need not await any data from the lab to say that self-transcendence is possible.I thought this book was interesting, but I wish the author had just talked about his own experience rather than trying to convince the reader that others should adopt his beliefs. He might have talked about how he used to feel a sense of unsatisfactoriness all the time, but now, after years of meditation, he feels a sense of total acceptance for the way things are; he feels a constant sense of equanimity and no longer has any fear of death. Does the author feel that way? Does he feel any different from the way he did before he started meditating? Does he actually feel like he has achieved enlightenment, or is closer to that vaunted state of being? I have no idea from reading this book.Instead, the author appears to be focused on trying to convince others to adopt his beliefs, when it seems obvious to me that his lifestyle is not for everyone. Most people could not afford to travel the world learning how to meditate from gurus. They justifiably feel obligated to pay their debts and support their families. Most people get their spirituality fix from more traditional sources, such as religion, music, nature, cultural events, family, friendship, etc. I do think there are studies that show that meditation is one thing that can make a person happier, but it is just one of many, and it is not as important as having close personal relationships. Many of the Mormons, which Harris has such disdain for, seem to live happy, successful lives without any drugs at all, not even coffee. Is that really so bad? The author's attitude seems very elitist to me.The author also seems to assume that if someone becomes completely detached from their “self” and simply allows themselves to experience consciousness and live in the present moment, that the person will be “ethical.” I doubt that that is true. I think that people need to put a lot of “thought” into living a life consistent with their values. I don’t have any problem with a person who chooses to be a hermit or a monk. I just don’t see how such people are as admirable as those who ""think"" about how they can ""do"" things to make the world a better place.Anyway, I thought this book was interesting, and I guess I can’t knock a life of meditation until I’ve tried it. It does, however, seem like embarking on such a life would require a leap of “faith.”"
260,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63454203-deb-in-ut,Rating 2 out of 5,"My son in law who is an atheist recommended this book. He'd only read half of it when he mentioned it to me. I don't know if he's finished it or not. We were talking about how to get past and overcome negative emotion and difficult circumstances. He said, ""I'm not religious, but I am spiritual."" I've heard that phrase a lot lately and wondered what it means to him and others. Well, now I know. We were also talking about secular Buddhism and meditation. I hoped this book would give me a greater understanding of his beliefs.Harris seems to say that spirituality is overcoming the self through meditation. I assume he means we can use meditation to overcome those natural, negative, implosive tendencies we all have. He mentions enlightenment and peace. He seems to include spirituality's positive effects of happiness and good will toward others. To him it seems all good morals such as compassion, honesty, and charity are and should be independent of religious beliefs. In fact, he seems to think religions are ridiculous at the very least, overly restrictive, too controlling, and often dangerous. I actively belong to a religion. His descriptions, especially of my own church, don't reflect the reality I've experienced. For a little while, I was tempted to be offended and not continue to read the book because of his viewpoint toward and criticisms of my particular church. Thankfully, he doesn't focus on his negative viewpoint through the bulk of the book. He's mostly condemnatory toward the beginning and end. I don't feel he knows enough about my religion to criticize it like he does. Only someone who fully lives it can truly know its benefits and understand its real faults. He's definitely biased against religion in general. Despite his words, I kept reading because my desire to understand my son in law was greater than my negative reaction to his opinion.Also, I somewhat understand Harris's skepticism of religions. I'm not stupid or blind. I know that faith can't be empirically or scientifically proven. Harris seems to only believe things that can be measured. I get that. I accept that some people find anything based on faith wishful thinking or delusional. The thing is, in living my religion I have repeatedly tested my beliefs. I have found my life and spirit better off because of them. I have all the proof I need. Yes, I still have questions. I am open to truth wherever I encounter it. My religion doesn't dangerously close me off from provable, scientific truths like the author implies religions do. It actually does the opposite. I respectfully differ with the author's opinion. I also feel sad he feels the need to belittle religion in order to separate it from his narrow scope of spirituality. Most of the book is about meditation and its benefits. Apparently, Harris recommends that the best way to achieve his kind of spirituality is through the mindfulness that can come through meditation. I have absolutely no problem with that. I also appreciate what he says about consciousness and the scientifically provable workings of the mind. None of that conflicts with my religious beliefs. I like this thought of his: ""Just the ability to meditate-- to rest as consciousness for a few moments prior to the arising of the next thought-- can offer a profound relief from mental suffering."" I have no doubt that meditating has definite and provable benefits.I think it's fascinating that the author fully admits the imperfections of gurus and the dangers of believing those teachers to be infallible. I see the same problem with many religious leaders. Just like him, I can take the truth from my teachers without expecting them to be perfect. I don't see his as path as better than my religious path, though it is much simpler and clearly requires much less of him. ""We need not come to the end of the path to experience the benefits of walking it,"" he says. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. The main path I benefit from is religiously based. I can incorporate Harris's ideas on meditation into my life as an enhancement to the multitude of benefits I receive when I live my religion.I will take the good from this book, but I don't think I'd recommend it. I probably learned more about meditation, the brain, and consciousness from another book I recently read about psychedelics. I'm still glad I read it so I can better understand others. So what will I say to my son in law when he asks about this? I might tell him I don't agree with everything the author says, but it is interesting to read about his experiences and viewpoints. I like what he says about meditation practices."
261,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18362346-valentina-salvatierra,Rating 4 out of 5,"Personal reflection: Until now, my meditation practice has been more or less improvised, not extremely systematic. I have based it on online articles, guided meditations, and direct experience. This book opens up intriguing avenues of future inquiry and practice in this domain (including for example several Buddhist teachers whose videotaped teachings I've already bookmarked), to the point where I even kind of understand the people who take off on journeys to Nepal or India seeking masters or gurus as part of their spiritual search. For now, the vast expanses of YouTube recordings and written teachings will have to suffice, however. Impersonal(-ish) review: A wonderful combination of empirical explanations and arguments about the nature of the mind, and more applied exercises. The way that Harris argues against the illusion of a stable, unified self using scientific evidence and philosophical thought experiments was surprisingly easy to follow given the density of the subject at hand. I tend to agree with his theoretical conclusions but equally important, I appreciated that he recognizes that simply thinking about these subjects in the abstract is not enough. Rather, spirituality as an empirical and non-religious affair requires that one actually try to experience the vacuity and non-existence of a distinct ""self"" in phenomenological terms, that one apply these methods of inquiry to one's own consciousness. Crucially, he also distinguishes this illusory ""self"" which one aims to dispel through spiritual practice from other forms of self (psychological self-identity, for example), and ""consciousness"" from the various contents of consciousness which, for example, neuro-science studies.Very usefully, Harris intersperses practical, step-by-step guides on how this might be done throughout the book, including a simple mindfulness meditation focusing on the breath, how to ""lose one's head"" from a subjective point of view, and an eye-contact meditation to be done with someone else which sounds really powerful (I just need a meditation partner now!). These are methods that anyone can try at any time, and it will be good to add them to my own meditation practice. There is no mystical mumo-jumbo or appeal to intellectual or spiritual authority, but rather very grounded exercises and arguments.The book's anti-religious bent seemed a bit excessive at times but to be honest it fits pretty well with my own intuitions about religious belief, and I thoroughly enjoyed the snarky tone and intellectual precision with which Harris takes apart fallacious and misleading approaches to spirituality. Further, he recognizes that what he proposes isn't necessarily part of science; he is clear that his position is not contradicted by the evidence but neither is it conclusively proven. Harris articulates this perspective and the intellectual honesty it entails much better than I can:The aims of spirituality are not exactly those of science, but neither are they unscientific. Search your mind, or pay attention to the conversations you have with other people, and you will discover that there are no real boundaries between science and any other discipline that attempts to make valid claims about the world on the basis of evidence and logic. (loc 2696)The difference between (neuro)science and what Harris does is one of scope: this book expounds a scientific approach to something that is usually the domain of religion, faith, and evidence-free assertion: inquiry into one's own mind and conscious experience. I think at one point he calls it ""first-person science"", because indeed no one can directly access the contents of someone else's enlightened or non-enlightened experience. For such a challenging topic to discuss in empirical terms, Harris does it remarkably well."
262,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9530632-allison,Rating 3 out of 5,"“We manage to avoid being happy while struggling to become happy, fulfilling one desire after the next, banishing our fears, grasping at pleasure, recoiling from pain - and thinking, interminably, about how best to keep the whole works up and running. As a consequence, we spend our lives being far less content than we might otherwise be. We often fail to appreciate what we have until we have lost it. We crave experiences, objects, relationships, only to grow bored with them. And yet the craving persists.” (34)“Being mindful is not a matter of thinking more clearly about experience; it is the act of experiencing more clearly, including the arising of thoughts themselves. Mindfulness is a vivid awareness of whatever is appearing in one’s mind or body - thoughts, sensations, moods - without grasping at the pleasant or recoiling from the unpleasant.” (36)“Consciousness is the context in which the objects of experience appear - the sight of this book, the sound of traffic, the sensation of your back against a chair. There is nowhere else for them to appear - for their very appearance is consciousness in action. And anything that is unique to your experience of the world must appear amid the contents of consciousness.” (88)“It isn’t enough to know, in the abstract, that thoughts continually arise or that one is thinking at this moment, for such knowledge is itself mediated by thoughts that are arising unrecognized. It is the identification with these thoughts - that is, the failure to recognize them as they spontaneously appear in consciousness - that produces the feeling of ‘I.’ One must be able to pay attention closely enough to glimpse what consciousness is like between thoughts - that is, prior to the rising of the next one. Consciousness does not feel like a self. Once one realizes this, the status of thoughts themselves, as transient expressions of consciousness, can be understood.” (102-3)“What you were calling ‘I’ is itself a feeling that arises among the contents of consciousness. Consciousness is prior to it, a mere witness of it, and, therefore, free of it in principle.” (104)Consciousness is the prior condition of every experience; the self or ego is an illusory appearance within it; look closely for what you were calling ‘I,’ and the feeling of being a separate self will disappear; what remains, as a matter of experience, is a field of consciousness - free, undivided, and intrinsically uncontaminated by its ever-changing contents.” (129)“It is by ceasing to cling to the contents of consciousness - to our thoughts, moods, and desires - that we make progress.” (197)“Once one recognizes the selflessness of consciousness, the practice of meditation becomes just a means of getting more familiar with it. The goal, thereafter, is to cease to overlook what is already the case.” (199)“Consciousness is simply the light by which the contours of mind and body are known. It is that which is aware of feelings such as joy, regret, amusement, and despair. It can seem to take their shape for a time, but it is possible to recognize that it never quite does. In fact, we can directly experience that consciousness is never improved or harmed by what it knows. Making this discovery, again and again, is the basis of spiritual life.” (205)"
263,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21375438-chance,Rating 2 out of 5,"I found this book to be profoundly underwhelming. While I don’t agree with Sam Harris on a number of things, I knew this going in and was still interested in what he would have to say on the subjects touched on in this book. However, I was very let down by the contents of this book, not by the fact that I disagreed with his views, but that I really didn’t enjoy the way in which he talked about the numerous subjects he touches on. Along with what I would call poor writing, I also found the structure of the book to be of such a quality that is just annoyed me.As I said, I went into this book knowing that I had my disagreements with Harris, and I do not intend this review to be a rebuttal of his views, but rather an opinion on the way he has presented those views within this book. I found the method in which Harris talks about the subject of religion and neurological function to be akin to the dryness one would experience while reading a textbook in the desert. Occasionally he will string together a few paragraphs that are enlightening or enjoyable, but even then he rarely achieves both of these things simultaneously. This book has a lot of information about a lot of different things but the way in which these bits of information are packaged is incredibly difficult to enjoy. I leave this book with the opinion that Sam Harris is a brilliant man but an awful writer.The dryness of this book is not only due to the writing, but also the actual construction of the book itself. There are times where Harris will carry on for a number of paragraphs attempting to dish out reasons you should understand his point and then other times you are asked to refer to the pages notes in the back of the book to read information that seems infinitely more important than what you are reading in the main body of the text. I don’t mind flipping to the back of the book for more information, but when it seemed like the more useful and sometimes more entertaining material was contained in the back of the book, it made me question the entire reasoning behind the structure. Certain rare passages find the balance of being informative and direct, while others seem to be very convoluted in a way that left me unclear of what I was supposed to gather from the string of paragraphs I just read. This isn’t a good thing, especially when the entire goal of this book is open people’s minds to number of viewpoints that will doubtlessly be alien to most.I found this book to be a confused collection of dry, rational, and reasonable points. I definitely learned things from this book, but I didn’t enjoy the process very much. I thought my biggest struggle with this book would my disagreements with the author, but it actually ended up being with the way he presented his points and not the points themselves."
264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43782327-christopher-rytting,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book helped me to reflect in some personally productive ways, and it presents some fascinating scientific findings. That being said, though, it could have been half as long and said no less or twice as long and been just as much of a chore. Broadly, the issue I take with the book is that Harris loves the image of himself as a bold dismisser of dogma, but it gives him no pause to assert, in an offensively circular logic, that some opinion of his is true because he believes it.In the introduction, we're told that humans are programmed to be perpetually dissatisfied because focus on our future, as opposed to present, well-being is an attribute that lends itself well to survival, with which evolution has fortunately cruelly endowed us. I find this argument persuasive, having lived 27 years with a steady drip of yearning and thinking about the future. The way to find happiness in the moment is to focus on the moment, trying to observe pure consciousness instead of the constant barrage of somewhat random thought presented by the default mode network (our brain's version of autopilot i.e. the thoughts and feelings which come when we don't try to exert any conscious influence on the mind)Studies on the split brain phenomenon, where epileptics' brains are cut with a knife into left and right hemispheres, shed some fascinating light on the functional specialization of the two halves of the brain. (This is where the idea comes from that the right half of the brain is creative and the left half logical). Importantly, though, it also shows a bewildering of schism of consciousness where, depending on which half of the brain you ask, you'll get a different answer. e.g. if someone says what they want to do (left brain), they might say ""race car driver"", but if that same person writes out what they want to do (right brain), they might say ""draftsman."" This suggests two loci of perception, opinion, and behavior, whereas the conventional wisdom is that one brain corresponds to one consciousness. Chapter 3 is laughable given the context of Sam Harris's harping on the utter foolishness of religion (of which any given page of the book will be all too eager to inform you). I kept expecting the promised ""logical and scientific reasons"" for the absence of a self to appear. All I found, though, was tirelessly beaten assertion that if you look for a self, you can't find it, and that this implies it doesn't exist. How is this any different from me saying ""I have felt God, and billions of others have, too, so it must exist."" This subjective flavor of claim is just the kind that Harris bristles at when it is based on a feeling that he hasn't had. I should say that I have no personal problem with having ideas that are based on feelings, or even evangelizing those ideas, using feeling as the basis of argument. But coming from Sam Harris, it reeks of hypocrisy.There is a fun moment of respite in Chapter 4, Meditation, where Harris presents a visual task, upon the performance of which the reader is convinced of the optic blind spot which exists in all of our eyes. Besides that, though, Chapter 3 is the beginning to a frustrating rest of the book, where Harris takes us through his definition of what makes a bad spiritual guru versus a good one, which gurus are his favorites, and a smattering of other miscellanea. The book, in my mind, should have been an extended blog post, as it read like one for last 3/5 chapters. I recommend skimming it at a healthy clip, stopping to read most carefully whenever he talks about scientific experiments."
265,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6780536-heather,Rating 3 out of 5,"What I expected when I saw the subtitle to this book “A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion” was something along the lines of “A Guide to Connecting with the Metaphysical Without the Dogmatism and Structures of Organized Religion.” What he actually meant was “A Guide to Experiencing Some Cool Things Without Ascribing Them to Any Metaphysical Source.” If I had really realized who Sam Harris was (one of the dogmatic and hostile-to-faith New Atheists), I probably would have seen this coming, but since I didn’t immediately recognize his name, it sort of blind-sided me. His redefinition of “spirituality” to exclude any association to “spirit” seems pretty strange to me. Basically, this book was written to convince a bunch of committed materialists that there could be benefits to “spiritual” practice without admitting any metaphysical reality. I’m not a committed materialist and thus, not the target audience. So, I found the constant self-defensiveness against charges of being “too metaphysical” wearisome and annoying, and fundamentally arrogant. “We who know better can use the insights and experiences of religion and spirituality while acknowledging them all to be totally stupid and crazy. Oh, but the Buddhist ones are better than the Western ones because that’s who I studied under.”I did find the neuroscientific studies Harris cited and the philosophical discussion of the self v. consciousness fascinating. If he had stopped with stating, like a true scientist, that we have found no physical evidence of a physical locus of the self in the brain, and that our sense of self can nonetheless be profoundly affected by changes to the chemistry or physical structure of the brain, I would have respected him much more. Instead, he goes a step further and insists that we accept that, based on his and others’ experiences, there is no self and the sense of being one is all an illusion. That’s a metaphysical interpretation as much as anybody else’s, of the type he says we shouldn’t make. The whole experience was somewhat like reading a book about the proven health benefits of running and the “fact” that when you really practice running for a long time, you’ll experience the reality that there is actually no “you” doing the running. There is just pure runningness itself. Anybody who interprets this experience in any kind of metaphysical way must clearly be stupid, but still, running is worth the effort for the mental experience of “runningness” nonetheless. 🙄"

Sam Harris, neuroscientist, philosopher, and atheist skeptic, presents us with an attempt at an objective, scientific view of mindfulness, consciousness, and spirituality. He really doesn’t mince his words when it comes to his opinion of organized religion (he thinks it’s rubbish), but he feels that there is something largely missing from the secular realm within which he finds himself - spirituality. I’m a bit of a skeptic myself and I’ve always been a little weary of New Age notions of spirituality. The idea of mindfulness, on the other hand, is very appealing. The idea of being present, peaceful, less dominated by one’s thoughts and anxieties. Yes. But the spiritual part is something I often find challenging. Sam’s book was very well researched and at times very funny and engaging. His analyses of cults, drugs, gurus, and the brain were particularly interesting. However, I will admit that I remain skeptical on several points. The main one being that the self is no more than an illusion - and that one need only be enlightened as to this truth. The whole idea of enlightenment sounds a bit shady to me. But, I have to say I find Sam Harris to be a genuine and thoughtful philosopher and his book has certainly encouraged me to get back into meditation, even if only to calm my nerves and be more present, rather than to attain enlightened self-transcendence.This was really just me dipping my toes into the water of mindfulness 🧘‍♀️ And I don’t think I could’ve found a better introduction than a fellow skeptic and very logical (at least for the most part) thinker. I still have my reservations about hallucinogenic drugs, the illusion of the self, and some of Harris’s other claims, but overall, this was an interesting read and I look forward to learning more about this subject.

Harris spends the first third of the book flattening all the world's thousands of cultures into ""east"" and ""west,"" and compares and contrasts them as if they're in conflict with each other. He absurdly thinks that the ""east"" has no notion of science or ""real"" medicine or vaccines. China was doing smallpox inoculations 300 years before Louis Pasteur. Harris spends a huge chunk of the book pushing explicitly fascist talking points whether he realizes it or not. Like in The End of Faith, he believes in this false notion that the world's problems are solely because of dogmatic religion, and completely ignores more important things like socioeconomic issues or imperialism -- things that actually create these kinds of conditions. Osama bin Laden very clearly said that the reason he attacked the WTC and the Pentagon was because US bases were on Saudi soil, but whatever. It's a very ignorant and childish view of history, and while I'd still recommend the book, you'd do best breezing past this part. He also spends a lot of time making apologies to his antitheist ""skeptic"" fans and trying to convince them them that meditation isn't dumb, which was actually kind of funny. It's a really fantastic book once he gets past this and into his actual area of expertise though. The stuff I learned about the origin and nature of consciousness here is some of the most fascinating stuff I've ever read, and it's going to stick with me for the rest of my life. His talk about psychedelics made me way more sympathetic to them, which is something I'd never thought I'd say as someone who's been straight edge for my entire life. I'm very new to meditation, and I was really looking for a way to get into it without the religious stuff, and Harris has given me a great blueprint. I'm super excited for what I'm getting myself into now."

That's not a dig. He seems gentle is all. Sam Harris is a controversial character for some, especially for my lefty friends, and the purpose of this review is not to litigate Harris' takes on Muslims or The Bell Curve or Ezra Klein (I sided with Klein on that one), but to assess the book. It's about meditation and the mind and spirituality and I found it rather dry and clinical relative to some of his other works. I really wrestle with the notion that the self is an illusion. I can understand it on an abstract level, but it never feels true, no matter how much time I spend meditating. ""Spirituality"" is a nebulous term. It means vastly different things to different people. For Harris, it's about recognizing the illusion of the self. For others, it's about compassion and love. I heard one definition that spirituality is the ability to weather the inevitable suffering of life with grace and dignity. For whatever reason, that resonated with me. Although I gotta say, whenever anyone describes themselves as ""spiritual"" I run the other way. There's someone about the social substrata of spiritual seekers that seems entirely devoid of humor or wit, Harris among them. Harris has a clear, analytical mind. That doesn't make him immune to blind spots. But it does mean mean that he is never funny. I think there's a paradox, where to be spiritual you have to take yourself seriously, and taking yourself too seriously makes you insufferable. My heroes laugh at themselves. That's what I like about the Dalai Lama. He's got a sense of humor. I've read several books by Harris at this point. I particularly liked Lying and Letter To A Christian Nation. "

Having seen or heard a few recorded addresses by the man, I was not expecting a book so very open minded and sensitive. My response to this book is deeply personal, and therefore I find it difficult to write a review. I am a man a year and a half into unbelief, still grieving the loss of my faith. I was an evangelical minister, raised in the church. Pushing forty, I now find myself often feeling like a child in many ways, reconstructing a worldview and healthy practice in the ruins of my disillusionment. This book is a tremendous help in that journey. I have been seeking spiritual practice, while struggling with the very notion of that desire as someone who is truly a skeptic. Harris' approach to spirituality, as an examination of the mind and our practices of meditation and practiced perspectives, is reasonable, yet rich. I will be purchasing this book. I recommend it to spiritual seekers who are also skeptics.+I just remembered. Several times as I read this book I was reminded of having read another book this year by the name Finding God In The Waves: How I Lost My Faith And Found It Again Through Science by Mike McHargue aka Science Mike. I had high hopes for that book that it did not come close to fulfilling. This book, however, filled the role I hoped for that book. Readers interested in Science Mike's book may do better to read this one instead. It has a lot of the same material, but is better written, with a greater intellectual rigour, and contains far more extensive notes."

I wasn't sure I would like it, given the use of the word ""spirituality"" and applying that to a secular lifestyle. However, author Sam Harris was acutely aware of how the word could be misunderstood and spent some time early in the book explaining his choice to use it: ""there is no other term — apart from the even more problematic mystical or the more restrictive contemplative — with which to discuss the efforts people make, through meditation, psychadelics, or other means, to fully bring their minds into the present or to induce nonordinary states of consciousness. And no other word links this spectrum of experience to our ethical lives.""The book itself is all about meditation and how a secular skeptic could practice it -- and why. In this sense, it was enlightening (pun intended) to me, though I admit I didn't grasp all of what Harris said. I'm no neurologist (Harris is). It is well-written with crisp and useful phrasing; no word is wasted.I stumbled several times in attempting to understand Harris' assertion that ""self"" is an illusion, especially since he used the word ""consciousness"" as something separate from the ""self"" that turns out to not be there. I have always used the word ""self"" or ""I"" to refer to my consciousness, which Harris admits exists, so I have no concept of this separate ""I/self"" that Harris tries to disprove."

I am also just starting out in the practice. I had hoped that Sam would describe in detail how to meditate, how long to meditate, what forms of meditation he recommends, and, most importantly, what meditation actually does and how it, as currently understood, works. Sam did present answers to some of these questions but the answers were not particularly detailed or illuminating to novice practitioners. He read a long passage from a guy who described the effects of mediation as if one’s head is missing which apparently has to do with a goal of meditation doing away with the concept of self. I carefully read the book but did not come away with even a start to the answering of my basic questions. I am totally open to the concept that meditation works and have respected friends who swear by it. But Sam did very little to further convince me of how and why it works or to provide a road map of how to achieve more peace through meditation. And he could have tried to answer these questions within the same footprint if he jettisoned his discussions of sham gurus and other flotsam that didn’t answer the central questions. Does anyone know of good books that address these fundamental questions with no or very little eastern mysticism or religiosity? I want to learn but only want rationale answers and explanations. "

While there was some New Age babbling and promotion of the use of psychodelics, there were also some interesting points to think about. The book would be good for a book club discussion -- if you had the right book club. You couldn't talk about it with anyone who fashions themselves ""religious"" without them shutting down. I was curious about the suggestion that children with autism appear to have diminished mirror neuron activity in proportion to the severity of their symptoms. But a study of compassion meditation among ""normal"" people found there was a significant increase in subjects' empathy over the course of 8 weeks. It would be interesting to train autistics in compassion meditation and determine if there is a sustained reduction in their symptoms. The author claims meditation leading to self-transcendence enables you to become better able to ""contribute to the well-being of others."" Yet, he talks about how the guru Ramana Maharshi spent years so absorbed in his experience of transfigured consciousness that he lost the ability to speak, remained motionless for days at a time, developed sores, and had to be tended by others. That's not exactly contributing to anybody's well-being. If everyone transcended self, it sounds like there would be no one to grow the food, make the clothes, build the shelters, and manufacture the medicine necessary to treat the skin sores of the ""enlightened."" Good thing some of us haven't woken up yet. "
273,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11820811-camelia-rose-on-hiatus,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sam Harris is a scientist, an atheist, and a meditator with many years of experiences. Waking Up is a sober, no-nonsense guide to spirituality for non-believers. In Chapter one, the author explains that he chose the word ""spiritual"" because of no other more suitable words, even though the word is entangled with religious believes, immaterial souls and supernatural beings and ghosts, which he does not refer to and has no intention to discuss. Yet, he didn't give a clear, precise and all-encompassing definition of it. The major part of the book is to argue why the SELF does not exist, using findings from neuroscience. Examples of split brain patients are explained. Don't pin your hope for immaterial souls on the wrong understanding of quantum mechanics either.On psychedelics drugs and spirituality:""I view most psychedelic experiences as potentially misleading. Psychedelics do not guarantee wisdom or clear recognition of the selfless nature of consciousness. They merely guarantee the content of the consciousness will change. Such visionary experiences, consider in their totality, appear to be ethically neutral therefore it seems psychedelic ecstasies must be steered towards our personal and collective wellsprings by some other principle. As Daniel Pinchbeck pointed out in his highly entertaining book, Breaking Open The Head, the fact that both the Maya and Aztec used psychedelics while being enthusiastic practitioner of human sacrifice makes any idealistic plant-based shamanism and enlightened society seems terribly naive. ""It seems Sam Harris knows a lot about Buddhism and Buddhists in the Western world. Again, being a master of meditation does not automatically come with a guarantee of high moral ground."

It’s marketed as a “Guide to Spirituality without Religion” but what it really is a collection of Harris’ thoughts on and personal experiences with spirituality, which could be interesting if he had anything new to bring to the conversation. The book offers some interesting passages on the science of consciousness- but those only encompass a small fraction of this book and hardly delve into deep detail. The parts about spirituality are similarly surface level - regurgitating the most basic tenets of Buddhism and meditation with no value added. I imagine this book would be beneficial to someone who 1.) had literally no knowledge of meditation or spirituality and 2.) was a die hard fan of Sam Harris. This book seems to presume that you already know of Harris and think highly of him. The book jacket exemplifies this best: “No other book marries contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no author other than Sam Harris-a scientist, philosopher, and famous skeptic-could write it.” Gag!I was also extremely turned off by the almost edgelord atheist tone he has towards religion in this book. I am also an atheist but find it tactless to ridicule religion and refer to it in derogatory words like bullshit. It’s just lazy writing snd plain disrespectful.I’m curious to try out some his guided meditations per my friend’s recommendations but didn’t really need the book! "
275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2198250-nikki,Rating 1 out of 5,"Anyone reading this book with the hopes of forming a spiritual life independent of religion will be completely disappointed. This book is about meditation. Apparently Harris thinks that meditation encompasses all of spirituality. He apparently hasn't talked to many religious people about their spiritual experiences which vary tremendously. But the bigger question I had was if Harris believes that once people develop a spiritual life independent of religion that organized religion will no longer be necessary. This seems germane to the topic of his book and yet it was never addressed. Of course Harris is interested in discrediting religion. Harris' point is that through meditation we can learn that there is no ""self"", there is only consciousness. Thus (in his opinion) there can't be a soul, which means that any religion that teaches about a soul must be false. Yet Harris is honest in pointing out that he (and science) still don't know where consciousness resides, so I'm not sure his argument is all that convincing.And the double-standard which Harris displays throughout this book is astonishing. Gurus are all frauds--except the gurus that Harris has. Spiritual experiences are the result of mental illness or drug use--except the spiritual experiences Harris has. Harris is convinced that science can cure the ""problem"" of religion. In 'The Moral Landscape' he shows how science can address the issue of morality. And this book is along those same lines, trying to address the issue of spiritual experiences. Yet until he can show how science can give people MEANING he will continue to flounder."
276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/651847-jess,Rating 3 out of 5,"Alternative suggested title: An Atheist's Guide to Spirituality through Meditation. Harris explains how meditation practice can reveal that the self (the ego) is an illusion, divides you from your ego, and connects you to a sense of human-ness that is both You and Not You. To Harris, spirituality is simply becoming aware of the impermanence of your thoughts...and since perception is reality, we can all stop clinging to our ever-shifting identities and become better people.Favorite quote: ""The fact that it is possible to love one's neighbor as oneself should be a great finding for the field of psychology, but it lends absolutely no credence to the claim that Jesus was the son of God, or even that God exists. Nor does it suggest that the ""energy"" of love somehow pervades the cosmos. These are historical and metaphysical claims that personal experience cannot justify.However, a phenomenon like self-transcending love does entitle us to make claims about the human mind. And this experience is so well attested and so readily achieved by those who devote themselves to specific practices (the Buddhist technique of metta meditation), or who even take the right drug (MDMA), that there is little controversy that this exists. Facts of this kind must now be understood in a rational context.The question of whether enlightenment is a permanent state need not detain us. The crucial point is that you can glimpse something about the nature of consciousness that can liberate you from suffering in the present. Even just recognizing the impermanence of your mental states--deeply, not merely as an idea--can transform your life. Every mental state you have ever had has risen and then passed away."" "

It is not a guide at all.Harris's idea of spirituality consists of meditation and doing mind-altering drugs, things I am not interested in at all. He completely neglects the tradition, community and sense of belonging associates with religion, which keeps people in churches long after their fate has turned stale.I am an atheist, yet I long for the rituals and events provided by religion. As a child, I used to make offerings to the ghosts on Halloween and burn incese when the seasons changed. I used to go to church on Christmas, celebrate Easter and do Tarot readings. It was a hot mess, but I just loved it.Now that I am an adult, it feels wrong to partake in rituals I don't believe in. But the void in my life is still there, and I am at a loss as to what to fill it with. Being an atheist doesn't cancel my need for traditions and a feeling of belonging. I want things to feel special and significant, but I am desperate for someone to show me how.I don't want to rate this book badly just because it wasn't the guide I had been looking for, but even so it was false advertisment.

He definitely walked a tight rope throughout the book trying to objectively explain few concepts of spirituality, and also with a healthy amount of his subjective experiences with his experiments on his contents of consciousness, without making me suspend much of my disbelief. It is a tricky thing to do and he has succeeded in it. The concept of self, enlightenment, self-transcendence & illusory-self was fascinating, yet flew over my head. It is like explaining what a higher dimension is, to a creature confined to see only three dimensions. The ideas that consciousness is divisible and can be proven experimentally, just blew my mind. I used to chide all the religions because my opinion was it didn't serve any purpose to 21st century living. I, now, have a renewed or newfound respect for all the religions, especially eastern ones and now, I'm a firm believer that the ideas from these religion venturing into/experimenting on one's own mind and it's contents are more critical than ever, in this pandemic ridden, cold and devoid-of-human-embrace world.

I also carry a bit of envy for him, as I feel he is one of those people which can create playful and intelligent sentences while talking about seemingly superficial subjects. Having said that, this book was a comforting read for me, as I feel I need to be reminded occasionally that all these petty things that we quibble over as humans are not to be taken so seriously, and the way we choose to see things is crucial in shaping our reality.“Our minds are all we have. They are all we have ever had. And they are all we can offer others. This might not be obvious, especially when there are aspects of your life that seem in need of improvement—when your goals are unrealized, or you are struggling to find a career, or you have relationships that need repairing. But it’s the truth. Every experience you have ever had has been shaped by your mind. Every relationship is as good or as bad as it is because of the minds involved. If you are perpetually angry, depressed, confused, and unloving, or your attention is elsewhere, it won’t matter how successful you become or who is in your life—you won’t enjoy any of it.”"

His thoughts on spirituality seem to boil down to that there is no “you” and that you can reach enlightenment (whatever that means) by letting go of the idea of self. You can do that through the long, slow and potentially unfruitful process of meditation or by taking the short cut of various mind enhancing drugs. Sprinkled in are sections that go deep into neuroscience and others that speak of spiritual gurus and cult leaders. I’m left wondering who this book is for. People likely to be convinced based on the science of consciousness are unlikely to be impressed by tales of year long science retreats. Those seeking insight in to Eastern mysticism are likely to be overwhelmed with technical details about the inner workings of the brain. There are definitely some interesting bits in here. I’m just not convinced that they belong in the same book or that letting go of the idea of self is a good goal or if meditation would even help with that.In the end, I do think meditation has the potential to benefit a person’s life, but I’m going to skip the psychedelics and callosotomy for now."

I picked up this book thinking it was one thing; but soon found myself fascinated with what it truly is. This book is not anti-religion or a case for why eastern religious philosophy is wrong. In fact, it pulls the parts of eastern philosophy away from the faith based aspect and explained one what is correct based on scientific understanding of the human brain and mind. Harris not only delves into the spirituality of eastern philosophy and how it can be applied to freethinkers in the Western Hemisphere, but also the neuroscience of the brain and how it works for those of us who do not adhere to the religious aspect that comes long with it much of the time. This book is about achieving spiritual understanding of one’s self and understanding of personal experiences in every day life, as well as an understanding of one’s “I.” This book is everything I thought it would be and more. A perfect introduction into this kind of spirituality for freethinkers from philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris. Another example of why he is one of my favorite writers/thinkers."
282,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"Interesting takeaways:* East vs West: ""We are encouraged to believe that all religions are the same."" That is, that they are all equally wise and compassionate. Harris takes a really refreshing and bold stance. He points out that it is logically not possible for every religion to be equally accepting: for example, a polytheistic religion can accommodate a monotheistic god, but by definition, not vice versa. * Gradual vs Sudden Realization: There is no self transcendence, enlightenment, or end goal to be reached from meditation. It doesn't even need to take years of practice. Spirituality is ultimately about becoming self-aware, and realizing you can observe your emotions, thoughts, and reactions. It's the pause between stimulus and response.* Benefits of mindfulness: Reduces neuroticism, improves your health, increases your happiness, etc.Main critique is that the writing could be much more accessible and less grandiose. There is a lot of unnecessary detail about various schools of Buddhism, yogic teachers, psychedelics, and other ""woo woo"" subjects.

I agree wholeheartedly with the premise: spirituality and meaning are and should be independent of religion and institutions. But, perhaps I didn't read it carefully enough on a sped-up audiobook because I am not sure I am closer to actually attaining that ideal. As a fan of Harris, I really didn't learn anything very new either.The book seemed more about proving spirituality and meaning can be independent than being a guide. I'm glad he has started the conversation at least. But, this is more a series of essays tangentially related to spirituality going into science, religion, criticizing specific thinkers, or drugs. I'm really not sure who the intended audience of this book is. Is it for people actually seeking spirituality without religion or a lure offering another path for religious people? It is both too abstract and argumentative to accomplish either goal. Sam Harris offers many ideas about spirituality that are probably invaluable once understood and internalized, but I didn't really grasp it.

Sam has written extensively about religion and is among the four horsemen of Atheism; while I am not really opposed to 'religions' as I believe there are important things to be found in them, I thought it would be interesting to look at spirituality (for the lack of a better word) from his lens. One of the key ideas of Sam is that what we call 'I' is an illusion, and that is what is explored in it. 'Waking Up' starts with how there is no 'I' to be found in the brain; he goes on to quote a lot of scientific research and how we do not fully understand what consciousness is, but we do understand how phenomenons like Split-brain basically establishes there is no 'soul' and thus subject-object duality is redundant. He then talks about meditation while one should not expect it to have instructions for meditations or talk about various techniques; the book introduces the reader to what meditation is beyond the various benefits and its ultimate goal. For this reason, books like 10 % happier by Dan Harris are a better introduction to the world of meditation.""We are always and everywhere in the presence of reality. Indeed, the human mind is the most complex and subtle expression of reality we have thus far encountered. This should grant profundity to the humble project of noticing what it is like to be you in the present.

I looked forward to reading ""Waking Up"" and wasn't disappointed, as he skillfully dissected the philosophy behind the idea of a ""self"" and ""consciousness"" - arguing that the two are totally separate. The ""self"" - he explains - is the reactionary part of ourselves that is formed by events, feelings, ideas and thoughts. These are usually colored by our upbringing, society's attitudes, psychological responses, personal motivations, desires and drives - all creating the will to succeed, conquer or grasp at the things we think we need.He draws on his experiences with meditation and his spiritual quests over the years, which includes many gurus and experiments with drugs, research and rumination. As the Buddhists and adherents of many enlightenment movements state - focusing on the needs and the grasping of the self is the source of suffering. Through meditation and contemplation, the self can be viewed as a mess of static thoughts that hinder spiritual progress.He argues that consciousness is like an invisible ""observer"" - taking a back seat to the busy (and sometimes exhausting) self. When we achieve that elevated state of enlightenment - where we've stripped away the yearnings and anguish attached to the self - we discover true consciousness.This is a difficult subject to write about, as we are all so overly attached to our daily lives, the people around us and the events we find ourselves participating in or observing. The idea of just ""being"" and letting go of our desire for earthly things - that can only lead to suffering - is easier said than done.I get it when he talks about a spirituality without religion - as dogma is just an attempt to control us and our connection to our spirituality. He has some great meditations to try and many interesting stories to tell, but a few moments made me stop and wonder if he employs this philosophy at all times.For example: he briefly touches on Madame Blavatsky - calling her ""enormously fat"" - which begs the question, What does that have to do with her metaphysical studies and bogus claims to be a Theosophical Master? She was fat, but his description came across as scornful and deliberately mocking. Mr Harris is often accused of being arrogant and he does - at times - seem to be going against exactly what he preaches, by resorting to cruel and sometimes nasty scoffing. This - I assume - is the ""self"" rearing it's ugly head.When he talks about the student who thought that she had achieved complete consciousness without thought, I could almost hear the snigger in his voice when he explained how the guru cut her down in front of everyone - telling her that he and the rest of the students would wait until she had a thought. I could almost see the gleam in his eye when he mentioned how quickly she was reduced to a doubting Thomas.I know that this sounds like I'm picking on him and making assumptions, but sometimes - perception is reality - even though he'd scoff at that too. I think he has a brilliant mind and that this is a great book, although even he himself would say that he has a long way to go - like the rest of us. The ego shows itself in many ways. He talks about his many adventures and experiences in retreats, trips to Nepal and other places. He also shares some fascinating anecdotes on drug usage and how some drugs can be beneficial when researching enlightenment and consciousness.The one thing that stood out (for me) was that it seems to be okay for Mr Harris to totally debunk religion and therefore tell everyone else what to think or how to think, based on his own revelations. This is exactly what he's been arguing against for the longest time. Now he's telling us how to experience spirituality, like only he has the answer.My attitude has always been - whatever works for you - as long as you're not hurting anyone else. I also scoff at religious morons who come out in public - trying to dictate how the rest of us should live. You can think what you want and even discuss it openly with those who want to hear it. Everyone is allowed to have an opinion, as long as we obey the law of the land, etc. Mr Harris has to be careful not to become one of the gurus or religious dictators he loves to tear down.Having said all that - I truly do believe that Mr Harris is on the right track. He just needs to check himself and ensure that he gives others the respect he expects for himself and his ideas. Another example that shows how dismissive he can be - was where he snubbed Numerology. It made me laugh - as I'm a Numerologist and often check myself by testing my calculations and trying to see if it's just projection or wishful thinking. I agree that it's definitely not a science - but to say that ""Numerology is where the intellect goes to die"" is melodramatic at best. I enjoy Numerology and find it fascinating. I do not consider myself an idiot and feel that my intellect is firmly intact. I could easily counter with a snarky comment about posturing as an enlightened guru, but that would be beneath me! (HaHa)One thing that tickled me was when he talked about a period in his life where he tried the ""eye control"" method on those he met. This involves what a lot of psychics and control freaks like to do - which is to maintain eye contact and exert power over whoever returns the gaze. He advises that he did it for a while and had many people (male and female) falling for him; essentially bewitching people with his stare. I laughed out loud on the bus - imagining him walking around glaring at people.I also wondered what kind of person would want to do this? Someone with a complex or a nervous disposition? Maybe someone with something to prove or perhaps a deep need to make contact with others - even to overpower them? Hmmm.After all is said and done - this was a great read with wonderful insights. It was a small shame that he didn't temper the ""self"" in order to illustrate his points by allowing his consciousness to do the talking."
286,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"In this book, Sam Harris attempts to formulate a framework for spirituality in the a sense of religion, based on the practice of meditation (starting with vipassana or mindfulness) in order to transcend the self and experience pure consciousness, unencumbered by thoughts, feelings and other distractions - the “waking up” that the title suggests.In the process, Harris delves into concepts from Buddhism, philosophy and neuroscience in order to show how consciousness is separate from the self and the benefits of striving to realise this through meditation.However, the book falls flat 2/3 through and the last chapter is spent on gurus who misuse their “power” or fame for immoral ends, which I felt a little unnecessary and didn’t add to the argument he was building up.Nevertheless, the preceding chapters are a good introduction to the ideas surrounding meditation and consciousness as I haven’t read much literature in this area. I also appreciate Harris’ podcast where he does in depth interviews on these and other topics."
287,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Harris presents an intriguing discussion about the nature of consciousness, the concept of self, and the veracity and validity of scientific enquiry and religious claims regarding spirituality. This book is not a manual on how to practice meditation, but an exploration of the value of its application, particularly for those of us without any religious affiliation. So do not read it in the hopes that it will provide concrete instruction on how to attain transcendence. In fact, it is a book that has posed more questions in my mind than it has answered. I knew that meditation feels good and promotes relaxation - I was just looking for some neurological context as to why this is so. What I had not yet considered were the implications of the split- brain phenomenon, in which each hemisphere appears to hold independent consciousness. A few minutes contemplating this and other profound neurological findings presented within makes one very uncertain about what precisely constitutes one's sense of self. If I were to take one thing away from this book, it would be that the non-religious ""spiritual"" state of mind, what Harris calls the intrinsic selflessness of consciousness, is common and reproducible. I view this free consciousness as a means of immersing oneself in the moment, mitigating anxiety and silencing the constant clatter of (mostly negative) narrative thought - something worth pursuing in these frustrating times."

While I haven't had the numerous experiences Harris has, I can say that a lot of what is says is on point in terms of the benefits of meditation in general. I appreciated some of the anecdotes provided by one who has studied with great teachers. However, as many have pointed out, Harris is extremely arrogant in his presentation of other thinkers' works and entire religions. He snubs Huxley's book on the Perennial Philosophy with just two sentences and never looks back. He literally states that the only difference between cults and religions is the number of followers. While he does provide a caveat in the introduction that he is not intending to provide an overview of these religions, this isn't enough to protect him from the fallacy of making sweeping conclusions based on shallow or incomplete information. If you are interested in learning about meditation I recommend Mindfulness in Plan English by Henepola Gunaratana. If you are interested in how practices like meditation (and others) can help rewire the brain I recommend The Brain That Changes Itself by Norman Doidge. In terms of the rest, read as widely from any religion you may have interest in and try it for yourself. Don't let someone like Sam Harris explain it for you."

He’s an impressive figure in that field, but I’ve always wished he’d set his mind to building instead of destroying. This seems to be such an attempt. His ideas on meditation and consciousness resonated with me but didn’t have much depth. That might be because “we can’t define or find consciousness” just about captures the current state of human knowledge. Nonetheless, Harris’s mix of science (what do hemispheric brain studies really teach about consciousness?) and religion (he shares minimalist glimpses into Buddhist thought) were clumsy. The science was interesting but proved what? The religious mentions were sometimes flattering (Buddhism) but not supported. The book seemed like an early draft manuscript. If this is your first text on consciousness and meditation, it’s probably an ok introduction. But there are better books if you want to go deeper. Harris might agree."

The organization of the book is haphazard at best, swinging from Harris' personal anecdotes regarding Buddhist Gurus and Psychadelic drugs, to logically discounting supernatual claims about near death experiences.while I am not turned off of mindfulness or meditation by this book, I am most certainly disappointed in Sam Harris, and this has pursuaded me to avoid other books written by him.as a note: I listened to this book as read by the author via Audible."

He excels at balancing the nature of science and philosophy, tackling the spiritual argument from both sides. Waking Up provides us with tools to unlock our mind, so we may experience reality at its full potential—that is if we are prepared to bend our traditional beliefs.Throughout the book, Harris argues that we must all open our eyes and recognize that the nature of consciousness can be broken down, the self is an illusion, and transcendence is within reach. With consistent mindfulness and meditative practices, we can achieve such altered states of mind. Highly recommend this regardless of your belief system."

You don’t need to believe in God, nirvana, or spiritual energy in order to apply the practices from this book, just a willingness to dedicate some time and experimentation to understand your mind more deeply.I’m familiar with basic mindfulness meditation practices, but it was interesting to hear about meditation which is very targeted inwards to quickly arrive at a form of “ego death” (a far-too-drastic shorthand for what Harris outlined).

Then he makes the case for meditation as a pathway to get there. This is not an in-depth primer on meditation practice, but nor is a book the best format for that anyway. What this does offer is some interesting neuroscience, and some perspective on consciousness and the idea of selfhood. The personal anecdotes were fun, as well as the survey of various Eastern ideas and gurus and how to evaluate their claims. Very worthwhile reading."

It's unthinking thinking.The fact that consciousness appears to be physically divisible into constituent parts of the brain, such that the hemispheres can argue with each other, demonstrates, theoretically at least, that we could probably connect parts of different brains together. Moreover that this would generate a unified consciousness in the subject.The freedom of the realisation of no self exists intrinsically, on its own.

Of course, I will do everything in my power to see that they choose their drugs wisely, but a life lived entirely without drugs is neither foreseeable nor, I think, desirable.

If they choose to smoke marijuana, I will urge moderation. Tobacco should be shunned, and I will do everything within the bounds of decent parenting to steer them away from it. Needless to say, if I knew that either of my daughters would eventually develop a fondness for methamphetamine or heroin, I might never sleep again. But if they don’t try a psychedelic like psilocybin or LSD at least once in their adult lives, I will wonder whether they had missed one of the most important rites of passage a human being can experience.This is not to say that everyone should take psychedelics. As I will make clear below, these drugs pose certain dangers. Undoubtedly, some people cannot afford to give the anchor of sanity even the slightest tug. It has been many years since I took psychedelics myself, and my abstinence is born of a healthy respect for the risks involved.

To do this, Harris utilizes neuroscience, current conceptions of consciousness, and a multitude of Buddhist ideas to construct a framework through which to view ecstatic experiences, and reaches the following conclusion through that framework: the idea of a self is an illusion, and this is a fact that be realized directly through meditation, the use of mind altering substances, and near death experiences. While all three forms of experience are talked about in the book, meditation tends to take the main stage, as, according to Harris, it is the most affective way to realize the illusion of a self without falling into the trap of fictional metaphysical ideas. From this he goes on to construct a framework through which secular individuals can experience spirituality in their lives, but without the dogma of religion.Before I say anything else about this book I feel like I should get something off my chest: I don't really like Sam Harris that much. I agree with many of the points he raises in this book and think he's a brilliant neuroscientist, but his opinions on religion are often grossly reductionistic and almost always offensive (not to mention his fetishization of ""Eastern"" religion in many parts of the book). That being said, I feel like there is a great deal of truth to what he says in this book, both about the self being an illusion and about how it's not only possible but that it's NECESSARY to divorce spirituality from dogma if we ever want to be able to coherently talk about religious experience. I felt in a lot of ways that this book summed up what I've for years been trying to say about such experiences but could never quite articulate. Harris uses his middle ground on religious experience to further another of the book's main points, a point that he claims can be realized when such transcendence is experienced outside the lens of religion: that by recognizing ego as an illusion of the mind, we can come to realize, through intensive practice and constant reminders, if there is no self then we are not our thoughts and therefore it is possible to let ourselves not be controlled by the things we think.

The last chapter on drugs was weird and good at the same time. I've never seen an author be more positive about drugs.

So, I really wanted to love this book more, but I can't rate it higher than a 2.5/5.Chapters 1 and 3 were great. Thought-provoking, funny, lots of new ideas - all written in a way that never really left me bored. But the other 3 chapters were sorely lacking both in new ideas and supports.I finished the book with a decreased desire for introspection from when I started, which is not a good sign for a book about meditation."
316,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22249197-tomas,Rating 4 out of 5,I have not expected to read text written by Sam Harris about gurus & spiritual journeys. I have tried to read this with open mind but some parts were simply to crazy for me anyway. I would not look for a teacher from Nepal to make me a happier and more complete person. That does not mean that I will not give a meditation a go. There is a podcast and an app that I will definitely try.Sam is very skilled in argumentation and has a nice feeling for metaphors so the book reads very easily without any need to google stuff. I have read End of Faith and Free will and I think it is recommended or even a bit expected that the reader know this texts or at least knows the idea behind them in broad strokes.
317,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"I was not super impressed by this book. I like the idea of extracting certain aspects of religion for my own benefit and discarding the rest that doesn't serve me. However, I don't think the author and I have a similar framework or approach to spirituality. While he seems to be concerned with rationally proving that spiritual experiences exist, I am more concerned with the mystical, the unknown, beauty, terror, etc. Scientifically proving the existence of such phenomena in consciousness seems like not only a gross oversimplification and impossible, but also just missing the point. I disagree with the premise. "
318,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16367796-francesco-portoso,Rating 4 out of 5,"Sam Harris is one of my current favorite thinkers and I regularly recommend his content (especially the Making Sense podcast and the meditation app - Waking up). Because of that, I was already familiar with most concepts from the book. I'd define it as a helpful read to investigate what spirituality could mean for secular and rational individuals through concepts from neuroscience, mindfulness meditation and the understanding of consciousness. Backed with plenty of scientific references and interesting stories from actual meditation retreats. Also, it includes a nice summary on recent discoveries about positive impact of certain psychedelics."
319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109928218-wade-z,Rating 4 out of 5,"A good source of glimpses into Eastern Religions, as well as some increased depth for enjoyers of his Waking Up app. Criticism can be had on depth and what ""spirituality"" is.Would have been nice to expand on some of the paradoxes that he mentions. Spirituality is not entirely justified, especially in some of the senses people will be attracted to (belonging, loss, wisdom) but this can perhaps be attributed to Harris' focus on """"""reliable"""""" empirical evidence. Judge for yourself whether the evidence he proposes is convincing. Certainly some parts can lead themselves to clarifying what meditation/mindfulness is/can be.I also kind of want to do drugs now...?"
320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43616446-benjamin-fitzgerald-hernandez,Rating 4 out of 5,"I highly recommend Sam Harris’s app, Waking Up. The book is what it says it is—a guide to spirituality without religion. I enjoyed hearing Sam’s take on all of these matters, specifically non-duality, from a secular, scientific standpoint. I am familiar with the teachings of non-duality via Advaita Vedanta and continue to find Sam’s direct pointers to those core insights helpful. I once felt strong resistance to Sam due to my evangelical upbringing, but now it’s all gratitude and appreciation. "
321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/152373174-kael,Rating 2 out of 5,"⭐⭐❌🪑 Not worth chair time.While I found the book to be an engaging read, it didn't entirely align with its titular promise. Only about a 1/4 of the content delves into 
""a guide to spirituality,""
 essentially emphasizing the value meditation while touching on psychedelics. The remaining 3/4 focus on the 
""without religion,""
 a topic Sam Harris has previously explored in-depth in his other works. Consequently, if you're seeking a book that delivers what the title suggests, you might be disappointed by the disproportionate emphasis on the latter."
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15957351-alex-yard,Rating 4 out of 5,"Definitely a good resource, and even though I've been using the Waking Up meditation app for several months, there was still a lot of interesting info in here so it wasn't pure overlap with the contents of the app. The most memorable sections were the studies on split brain patients, and analysis of consciousness and the very real possibility that the other hemisphere of the brain is conscious. And, all of this is relevant to the topic of free will."
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1127480-lisa-butterworth,Rating 3 out of 5,"I love the idea of this book and i think it's deeply needed. I work with so many clients who long for some kind of spiritual practice after facing a change or loss of faith. I was really hoping for something more substantial with pragmatic suggestions for implementing a spiritual practice, But mostly this is just your standard issue western/secular Buddhism book, and not nearly as well done as Robert Wright, Alan Watts, or Tara Brach. "
324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47622372-andy-mitchell,Rating 5 out of 5,"It's refreshing to see an investigation into spirituality without all the pseudoscience typically associated it. I was intrigued by the potential psychological benefits, particularly in eastern religions, of the religious practices analysed from a scientific perspective. Some of the questions posed in the book really make me question consciousness and the perception of self as well as the relationship between the mind and the brain. I did struggle at times to get my head around some of the thought experiments Harris presents, but perhaps this is because I am relatively new to the world of spirituality viewed through a secular lens.

It’s the clearest description of how getting caught up in thinking and distraction, and then identifying with that thinking is such a profound source of unhappiness that I’ve read so far.His whole thesis of the self being an illusion was a bit far for me, but he also says this realization comes with practice, so maybe.The one major problem I had was his use of the terms East and West as if those two words represent coherent worldviews and bodies of thought when in fact they do not."
326,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"In his book Waking Up, Harris encourages us to cultivate the discipline of meditation and experience for ourselves its benefits. He’s created an app of the same name with daily 10-minute meditations and various lessons. Intellectually he’s convinced me there is something to it, but empirically my own little experiment is still running as I work through his course. The intellectual arguments in favor of meditating seem clear. I’m lost in thought a lot of the time and dismayed when I realize I have been thinking without an awareness that I’m thinking. Reading Harris’ book, I would like to snap out of those ‘dreams’ and Wake Up to the present moment. The human mind is thought to be unique in its capacity to evaluate the past and plan the future, but that might be both a benefit and a curse. We might do better by training our minds to emulate those of lesser animals who live only in the now. Although not stated in those terms, that seems to be the goal of the meditation Harris recommends. ""The reality of your life is always now. And to realize this, we will see, is liberating. In fact, I think there is nothing more important to understand if you want to be happy in this world.”There is little question that we suffer by our minds. In the novel “Crime and Punishment” the character Raskolnikov suffers psychologically for the crime of murder; the ‘punishment’ takes place entirely within his own consciousness as he is tyrannized and oppressed by his thoughts. While a murder is an extreme example, we routinely beat ourselves up over much lesser ‘offences’ many of which may not even be registered by others. On the flip side of mental anguish, the pleasures we experience are no less troubling as there is an emptiness in moving from one to the next, knowing each will be a mere fleeting and transient gratification. This idea is the core of Buddhism which aims to free ourselves of desire as the cause of suffering. “Here is its logic: If there exists a source of psychological well-being that does not depend upon merely gratifying one’s desires, then it should be present even when all the usual sources of pleasure have been removed.”. Perhaps the novel “In the First Circle”, offers just such a setting by depicting life within a Russian prison under Stalin’s regime. The prisoners, which consist of many of the country’s top scientists and engineers who somehow offended the regime – lead pitiful lives deprived of nearly every conceivable pleasure. Despite having no rights, privacy or hope for release, the men find a kind of peace, strength and contentment. Unlikely as it seems, there it is at the core of human existence, a peace that resides in the moment to moment living of their lives.  “There is now little question that how one uses one’s attention, moment to moment, largely determines what kind of person one becomes. Our minds—and lives—are largely shaped by how we use them.”Short of extreme deprivation, can we achieve inner peace and contentment another way through meditation? Again, it’s hard to say, but to Harris’ credit he warns us that choosing a spiritual teacher – a somewhat necessary step – is no easy task. Those who claim to have achieved enlightenment may be mistaken or may simply like to take advantage of their naive and pliant disciples. Harris devotes considerable space to describing the seductive appeal of cults and the ease with which self-professed gurus can attract and exploit their followers. I suspect he included this section to show that he’s not lost his head, and while it takes one to know one, that he’s most certainly not one of them. Harris believe that the “self” is an illusion. When we search for the center of our being it’s simply not there. When we introspectively examine our experience there is only a cloud of consciousness in which appear sounds, sensations, and thoughts. There is no “thinker” of thoughts that remains fixed over time, only the ever-changing contents of our consciousness.This has been a difficult idea for me to grapple with, and I’m not so sure I fully understand it or its implications. What I do surmise is that spiritual transcendence, for Harris, is about collapsing the illusion of the self, which I think implies total immersion in the present. That is, the state of believing, or perhaps recognizing, that there are longer two entities: you and the world, but only the world itself. Experiencing the world directly, without inter-mediation, and trying to persist in this state of altered consciousness as long as possible. Speaking of altered consciousness, Harris writes openly about his experiences on psychedelics and recommends these experiences to others, albeit acknowledging their risks. He likens such experiences to being strapped to a rocket ship, while meditation is akin to gently raising a sail. Overall, I found Harris’s book engaging and well argued. Just as Harris and others, such as Christopher Hitchens, have decoupled ethics from religion, this book does the same for spirituality. In an increasingly secular world, where religion has fallen from favor, where life for many is frenetic and harried, and where loneliness and malaise are epidemic, meditation presents as an important tool to improve well being."
327,no user info,No Rating,"I have to admit that this book is above me and I definitely need to give it more attention and a re-read. I found the content very interesting, but like I said it is a bit above me and I struggled to grasp all the concepts. I therefore reserve judgement / rating until I can give it more attention. "
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6076891-sergey-shishkin,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've read about the benefits of mindfulness before, as well as about the basic technique of meditation: keeping focus on breath, while acknowledging arising thoughts and bodily sensations. However I've never came across a clear explanation of the goal of mindfulness, what the state of enlightenment might look like in non-religious terms, and how meditation works to achieve it. This book for me was clear enough treatment of those topics. It's also quite philosophical and non-dogmatic."
329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4890649-bobparr,Rating 5 out of 5,"Divertente e sfacciato, il libro di Harris è un must-have per chiunque si interessi degli argomenti spirituali. Fa domande scomode e da' risposte intelligenti. Ma sono ancora nel mezzo, attendiamo la fine.***Ho scritto allo staff di Sam Harris chiedendo se ci poteva essere, in futuro, la possibilità di vedere qualche testo tradotto in italiano. Nel giro di 4 ore mi hanno risposto che ""currently , we're not exploring any translation as of the moment to any other languages"".E questo è un peccato, perchè visti gli argomenti trattati, il libro va capito bene. Quindi me lo sono tradotto un pezzo alla volta con gli strumenti online, perchè la lettura sommaria che potevo farne, vista la mia parziale conoscenza della lingua, sarebbe stata riduttiva.Ho fatto bene: il testo è (pur nella imperfezione di una mia traduzione a volte legnosa) illuminante, intelligente, saggio e stimolante. I punti di vista di Harris sono utilissimi e sfrondati delle facili credulonerie e generalizzazioni che possono occorrere quando si parla di coscienza. Finalmente poi si legge di un punto di vista utilissimo sull'uso delle droghe, di cui non avevo piu' notizia dopo Huxley - e dopo la fiction di Stati di allucinazione di Chayefsky.Un testo molto utile, che apre alle tecniche dello Dzogchen e che volentieri si rilegge."
