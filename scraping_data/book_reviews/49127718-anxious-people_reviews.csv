This is my goodreads 2020 choice as best fiction novel! It came at the second place and I adored “ Midnight Library” too. But this one still has special place in my heart! It’s still my favorite fiction reads of the year! Good news: This amazing is about to be adapted in Swedish series. And fingers crossed, I hope Netflix buys this limited series so we may enjoy them! This is one of my favorite, highly recommended fiction novels of 2020! I think my vocabulary is so limited to express how this book made me feel. Yes, it shook me so hard but it also entertained the hell of me. It was tragic, tear jerker, but it was also funny, enjoyable, witty! It was action packed, riveting, heart throbbing but it was also thought-provoking, complex, dazzling, deceptive, educational and heartfelt.I know you got confused. How a book makes laugh so hard and then makes you cry like a baby and also hooks you up from its riveting, exciting chapters and at some parts you want to stop, taking a deep breath to absorb what you read, aching for characters, feeling their pain but you’re also laughing their ridiculousness! This book captivates your heart, brain and your soul at the same time and plays with your emotional balance, juggling between different genres and you just want to clap the author and take a bow for his remarkable, original, unique work.His sarcastic, witty and dark sense of humor reminded me of Guy Ritchie’s crime/dark comedy scripts (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch) and his quirky, sarcastic, awkward characters slowly warms your heart and entertains the hell of you! As soon as I finish it, I turned back and reread the police interrogation parts of the book and I laughed over and over!!!So what this book is about? Bunch of idiot people? YESAn unsuccessful bank robbery attempt and hostage situation? YES. What a minute! If the robbery is unsuccessful, how the thief managed to take hostages? And how many hostages he has? 8 hostages!Is this book about suicide attempts on the bridge? YES!Is this about stock markets, mortgages, banking system and destroying effects of capitalism makes rich people richer and makes you poor… yes, you may fill the blanks…! YES!I guess you must be confused again but don’t! Even though the book looks like a puzzle, all the pieces find their right place and so many twists that you may not foresee confuse you more but at the end you realize you read something so spectacular make you question your morals, your judgments, beliefs, the way you look at the life and test your decency.Jack and Jim, police officers, son and father, carrying Whiskey brand names, are anxious people who are not happy about their lives, polar opposites, barely stand with each other but unfortunately they are still colleagues and they’re interrogating hostages about the whereabouts of the bank robber. Oh sorry, the guy couldn’t rob the bank because the bank didn’t have enough money and young intern just called the cops so the unsuccessful bank robber runs into an apartment viewing. 8 people seeing the house become the worst bank robber’s reluctant hostages. But I have to admit they are the WORST BATSHIT CRAZY HOSTAGES you may imagine!Jack and Jim surrounded the building with their colleagues, called the big guns from Stockholm to save the hostages from another syndrome but they hear gun shot and when they go to check the building, they see the blood stains in the living room but amateur bank robber (you’re gonna understand my reasoning why I keep tell the robber this silly name after reading this book!) is nowhere to be seen. So Jack thinks one of the hostages helped the first time robber. Or they may hide something from them.So we’re moving back and forth between interrogations, the hostages’ back stories, secrets, the reasons behind they want to see the house. And naturally my favorite hostages are sarcastic, direct, cruel, smart, entertaining, cool Zara and golden-hearted Estelle (I wish she would be my grandma and her story broke my heart into pieces)The ending of the story (or let’s say new beginnings of the characters’ stories) was surprising but also heart melting, memorable, tear jerking. And I forget to add what this book is about… IT IS ABOUT REAL LOVE…Thanks to Atria Books/Simon Schuster for sending this special ARC to me in exchange my honest review. I love this author’s works so much and this is one of the best books I’ve read on 2020.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter a"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11626803-val-shameless-handmaiden,Rating 2 out of 5,"2 - 2.5 StarsI am definitely in the minority on this and I am very aware of that...all I can say is, Backman can really write (although I already knew that). And he can really write people. Which I also knew...The problem was I just didn't actually like any of the people here. Or the plot. Now, I'm not saying I always have to like all the people in a story to like the story itself. But when I not only dislike the people, but think they are completely obnoxious? And I think the plot is ridiculous and makes bumbling idiots of everyone involved?  And, yes, I am aware the characters were supposed to be bumbling idiots. The narrator calls them idiots multiple times throughout the book. It was a theme. After all, we are all idiots at what time or another, right? *wink wink* See what Backman I did there? *nudge nudge* (All throughout the book, mind you.) I know all the quirkiness was supposed to give me all the feels and and all that. Instead, it just grated on me. Now, to be clear, I didn't outright hate this or anything. As I said, the writing was superb. I thought there were a lot of cute moments and I really liked some of the narratives Backman explored about life, human nature, the human condition in a modern world, and anxiety as a whole. My love for those things just didn't offset my general sense of annoyance at the characters and the plot enough. But, oh well. As I said, I am definitely in the minority on this one. I know most people loved this. And if you think you might too, you should absolutely give it a go. I will definitely read more Backman in the future. This was just a miss for me, that's all.EDITED: Because I am sick of repeating this in the comments, I'm adding this here...I'm not stupid, folks. I understood why the characters were acting like idiots. I understand they were purposefully behaving that way to protect the true ""robber"". I didn't ""miss it"" and thus not like the story because of it. I understood what was happening. I ""got"" was Backman was doing. I don't need it explained to me. The characters - regardless of their motivations - just annoyed me and I did not like the book. It's that simple. I thought I made this clear enough in my review, but I guess not. "
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30181442-yun,Rating 5 out of 5,"Oh my, what an absolute gem this turned out to be! It's quintessential Backman: quirky, heartwarming, and uplifting.On the surface, Anxious People is a story about a bank robbery gone wrong. The bank robber, having failed at robbing a bank, bursts upon an apartment viewing and proceeds to take a group of unfortunate strangers hostage. This group of mismatched folks, each with their secret fears and mistakes, slowly open their hearts to one another, and as a result, find their lives inexplicably changed for the better.At its heart, this is a story that speaks to the humanity in all of us. No matter our backgrounds or experiences, we each have done the best we can with what we are given. We have messy feelings that go with our messy lives. We've made mistakes and all deserve second chances to redeem ourselves. That is what Backman has captured so deftly with his tale.Reading this book feels like digging through a treasure trove, with wonderful surprises at every turn. There's even a little mystery in here, when the police tries to reconstruct what happened, and things don't seem as straightforward as they initially thought. The mystery is really a small part of the story, but even that is superbly done and managed to surprise and delight me.Backman's writing style has always been quirky and his themes somewhat sentimental, but the two elements balance each other out, so that the quirkiness cuts through the cheesiness and helps to tone it down. The theme of this story, when you think about it, is really more sentimental than all the rest, so I found the writing to be even quirkier than his other books. I really enjoyed it, but I can see how this style wouldn't be for every reader or even every moment.I appreciate that Backman tries to tackle complex and timely topics in his books, and he does so in such an uplifting way. Especially now, when we live in a world more divisive than it's ever been, this story reminds us that if we only take the time to get to know the other side, we'd realize we are more alike than we are different. In my opinion, it's an overly optimistic stance, but it's still healing to be able to escape into this imaginary, wonderful world, even if just for a few hours."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49815208-marilynw,Rating 5 out of 5,"Anxious People by Fredrik Backman hit me right in the part of me that I never want to discuss, the part that I don't even know how to discuss. He knows how we feel at our lowest moments, during our biggest and smallest times of disappointment, grief, and feelings of despair. Yet, rather than bringing me down, he lightens my heart because we aren't alone in these feelings. There is humor in how we feel and there is hope in low times. This book made me laugh and I loved it. So now, watch me call all of us idiots because Backman makes such good points about the subject. We aren't alone in our idiot-ness, though. That could be beside the point or it could be THE point . Things happen, mistakes are made, but sometimes we can do things that alter the path of those mistakes before they become so destructive that we can't pull back from the black hole we are facing. There is a very reluctant bank robber-to-be and when attempting to rob a bank, the bank robber makes the biggest mistake a bank robber can make. So the failed bank robber runs and accidently takes an apartment of people hostage. The now hostage taker is having a very bad day, worse than the bad day they were having before they tried to rob a bank. And the hostages! The hostages are the worst! What is wrong with these people! We learn more about the hostage taker and the hostages and I loved it all. The two police officers, who later try to question the former hostages, are at their wits ends. The former hostages won't answer questions, they talk in circles, they ask their own very unhelpful questions, it's obvious that they are idiots and the police officers feel like they are idiots, too. How can so much go wrong and where is the bank robber/hostage taker? How did they escape from a closed area, with only one guarded exit. Just what is going on?Publication: September 8, 2020Thank you to Atria Books and NetGalley for this ARC."

In it, he notices an apartment door open. There is a showing for the apartment, and there are prospective buyers inside. He enters the apartment to clear his thoughts but finds that these are the worst hostages ever. Meanwhile, the police in this small town are hot on the trail of the bank robber. Will they be able to discover who is the bank robber and where to find him?Anxious People is very true, hilarious, and also moving at times. In my typical reading fashion, I practiced immersion reading (listening to the audiobook while following along in the printed version). The audiobook was amazing! I really enjoyed the entire performance and all of the different character voices. Anxious People also has one of the strongest openings that I have read. It is rare that I enjoy a book so much from the first chapter; however, this book was laugh out loud funny, starting from the very first chapter. There were some portions in the last half of the book that I thought dragged a bit but because this book made me laugh so much that I had to overlook that. Overall, if you are looking for a heart-warming, hilarious story, definitely give this a read!2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta"
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32879029-emma,Rating 3 out of 5,"The thing about this book is that it is cotton candy-level, cavity-threatening, headache-inducing type sweet, and simultaneously very sad and real and filled with the most upsetting things about being alive.A real whirlwind.If you are in the right mood for this book (which I was when I started it), then it is a whimsical, amusing, life-affirming journey to becoming an optimist.But if you are not (which I suddenly shapeshifted into at some point), it is arduous to get through and kind of annoying.I personally prefer the version of myself that enjoyed this book, but unfortunately that version of myself only stuck around for a day or less and left the more powerful version of me to wade through this for the following 6 days.Still, I'd like to be an optimist. So...3.5 stars.But rounded down.

6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91520258-jack-edwards,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book wins the Goofy Award™ for a novel which is both absurdly unserious and yet deeply moving.There’s a hostage situation… except it’s not as simple as that. An assortment of characters are held captive in an apartment, representing a microcosm of society with a mix of ages / professions / orientations / dilemmas. On paper, most of them have nothing in common, but as the saga unfolds they begin to bond over the things that make them different, and the things that make them the same. They find ways to build bridges (pun intended if you've read the book) with one another in endearing, heart-warming ways.The overall impact is powerful: it's a lesson in empathy, recognising that each person is living a complex interior life which takes time to understand beyond our first impressions. I think this book would be great for getting you out of a reading slump.I will say that sometimes Backman's humour verged on the cheesy side and the storytelling became a tad silly in its farfetchedness, but you can choose to embrace it and enjoy the touching moments instead."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94609512-oyshik,Rating 5 out of 5,"Anxious People by Fredrik BackmanThought-provoking, heartbreaking but amusing. It is a perfect mix of tragic and hilarious, believable and absurd. The whimsical & humorous writing style about real subjects like suicide, depression made this story remarkable. 
God doesn't protect people from knives, sweetheart. That's why God gave us other people, so we can protect each other.
Sweet Story"
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,No Rating,"DNF at 15%. The author tries too hard to be witty and quirky with a ""deep message"", but is neither funny or appealing. He uses an abundance of similes such as comparing children to kites (you hold on tight but the wind carries them off anyway) and fog is ""like someone setting fire to ghosts"" (has he actually set fire to one to know what it looks like?). My eyes were rolling. The witnesses to a bank robbery exhibit unrealistic and weird behavior (which is supposed to be quirky?). The 3rd person POV adds to the lack of appeal. Many readers love this author and this book, so do check out other reviews. I'm obviously the wrong reader.* I received an e-galley via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review"
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4514828-susanne,Rating 5 out of 5,"*Updated 11/8/20* Buddy Listen with Kaceey! I'm so grateful that I got to share my love for this book with my book buddy and am so glad that Kaceey loved this book as much as I did. *5 Powerful Stars“Anxious People” is a thought provoking, heart-wrenching, comical novel that leaves you in wonderment. It’s Fredrik Backman at his best.  At its heart, this book deals with human connection and the impact people have on each other. It showcases Mr. Backman’s talent in an entirely new way and it is another reminder as to why he is one of my favorite authors. Fredrik Backman is an author who has an innate ability to capture the human spirit, get under his characters’ skins and relay his characters thoughts and feelings in a way that makes us feel as if we know them, as if we are friends with them and at times, as if we are them. “Anxious People” is different from Backman’s other novels, there are no quirky curmudgeons like Ove or Britt-Marie and there are no Benji’s. This story features a Bank Robber, a Hostage Situation, a Real Estate Agent and an entire cast of other extremely complicated characters. This is a character driven novel and it delves into the trials and tribulations of each individual whose lives are affected by the situation that they are in. I had no idea what I was in for when I dived in - what I will say is that each and every character will steal your heart. It’s that thing called human connection. Within just a few minutes of reading this, tears pricked my eyes and I knew from that moment on that this book was special. It is wild and crazy and unlike anything you’ve ever read. At times you will be exasperated and yet you will keep reading. One minute you will be laughing and the next you will be in tears. For me, it happened and happened often. Once again, Fredrik Backman does something special here and I’m so very grateful for it.  “Anxious People” is a must read and will most certainly be on my Goodreads Best of List for 2020. This novel reminded me that everything I do can potentially impact others and therefore, I must think before I act. It also reminded me how important human connection is and how grateful I am for the relationships I have built with all of you. Though times are difficult right now, I am thankful that we have each other. I wish you all good health, peace and safety. Namaste. A huge thank you to Ms. Ariele Friedman at Atria Books and NetGalley for the arc. Thank you also to Fredrik Backman for continuing to write such incredible words. You inspire me.Published on Goodreads on 5.9.2020."

Fredrik Backman shows it marvelously through this novel.What makes this novel unique? Is it the elegance amid the chaos? Is it the hope of a better future amid the downright macabre of the present? Is it the humor amid the tragedy? Is it the author's prowess to make us smile and cry at the same time?This book is an artistic creation, which subjugates our introspection and overwhelms our contemplations on possible comparisons and interpretations. If you are an art aficionado, you are invariably going to relish the experience of reading this book.

‘we are doing the best we can, we really are...’
this message is the heart of this story.
‘…we all have this in common, yet most of us remain strangers, we never know what we do to each other, how your life is affected by mine. when this day is over and the night takes us, allow yourself a deep breath. because we made it through another day.’
and this is the heart of us readers.this is a story that will speak to everyone who picks it up - from the anxious to the confident, from the broken to the loved, from the young to the old, and everyone in between. the fact that FB can take such heavy topics about people and life and so respectfully explore them in a light-hearted way is still truly astounding to me. and its truly a testament to FBs writing skills that he can continue to construct stories that are relevant and not only resonate with, but emotionally touch, such a wide audience. this story is nothing short of the perfection FB consistently creates. ↠ 4.5 stars"

14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16912659-dorie---cats-books,Rating 5 out of 5," ****FINALIST IN THE GOODREADS CHOICE AWARDS, EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD****This will definitely be a top 10 book for me this year!!I have now read all of Mr. Bachman’s books and have enjoyed them all. This book had me engaged from the very beginning.There are a handful of characters and they are all well developed. He is a genius when it comes to portraying people, their emotions, their habits, their “quirkiness”. This book reminded me of a Seinfeld episode. There are lots of things going on involving most of the usual cast and they don’t all get tied together until the end. I knew that there were underlying connections but I didn’t really guess all of them until they were revealed. As you know from the quite extensive blurb this is “ a poignant comedy about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined.”I took a lot of notes about things that made me laugh but to share them would ruin the surprise for you, the new reader. I have never been so amused while learning lessons about life.“Everyone inside the apartment had their own complexes, their own demons and anxieties: Roger was wounded, Anna-Lenna wanted to go home, Julia was tired, Ro was worried, Zara was in pain, and Estelle . . .well . . .no one really knew what Estelle was yet. Possibly not even Estelle”Along with the narration of the events taking place there are also pages of interviews. After the event the police are trying very hard not to personally implode as they interview the hostages who really weren’t hostages!!! Why are they being so uncooperative????This book is best gone into blind, you won’t understand how incredibly well written it is until you immerse yourself in the story.If you have read any of Mr. Bachman’s books before, BUY THIS BOOK. If you have never read any of Mr. Bachman’s books, BUY THIS BOOK. There are some serious issues dealt with along with the lighter tone of the novel including: divorce, lack of leadership, father-son relationships, betrayal by someone you love, psychological problems including thoughts of suicide. I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss."

In all seriousness, though, it is appropriate title because it is a character study and a character driven mystery. As you learn about the people along the way, you might learn a little bit about yourself.I love the way that Backman writes. He only has one book that I did not completely adore (My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry). I am excited every time I see a new book is out from him and I cannot wait to check out some of his earlier works I haven't tried yet. If you have loved his writing before, I give you my 100% guarantee that you will 100% love this one.This was another Couch Time listen with my wife. We enjoy finding books we think we might both enjoy and we take time after the kids have gone to bed to listen to them together. It is my favorite time of the day! This was an AWESOME audiobook and I LOVED the narration. Marin Ireland is a fantastic narrator - I will be looking for more books with her narration in the future.Final verdict: very, very great! Read it!"

The Written Review




“Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.”

Oh my gosh. 
Like most Backman books at this point...I'm at a complete loss regarding how to tell you that this book is, quite frankly, the best thing I've read all year.I'm just overwhelmed by the sheer goodness of this book...and if I were to try to summarize it...It would be:Failed bank robber takes on kidnapping role (unintentionally) and also kinda fails at it....but in a good way? Like a laugh-cry-laugh way.Oh gosh. Now I'm not making sense.Essentially, this book was amazing. But you really just have to read it yourself.As always Backman is able to instantly create fully-fleshed out characters from just a few sentences and he plays your emotions like a violin. I've never listened to an audiobook and had that serious of a yo-yo happening constantly - like there would be literal tears leaking out of my face followed by laughter. The way all of the characters came together and fed off of each other's energy was amazing. The way their pasts interwove with their presents was just as stunning. This truly was an amazing book and I cannot recommend it enough.

17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1246837-maggie-stiefvater,Rating 5 out of 5,"This Swedish novel is about a hapless apartment viewing, a hapless bank robbery, and a hapless hostage situation. It’s a peculiar, stylized book with a brand of comedy that made me feel like I was watching a version of Amelie where she takes her neighbors hostage by accident. It’s a very kind novel. It's a very dark novel. It's a very light novel. It's a novel, it notes, about idiots.(and now I understand why readers, after finishing All the Crooked Saints, have suggested I try a Backman novel)"
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem,Rating 1 out of 5,"I tried, I really tried folks, but I just didn't find it funny, compassionate or entertaining. So many of my friends are loving this one and I enjoyed reading their reviews on the novel but for me it was a tedious and an annoying read.  Looking back on the books I have read by this author I just realised I don't enjoy his humour. Having loved Beartown and And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer and disliking Britt-Marie Was Here,A Man Called Ove his humour is wasted on me. I thought this novel just trying to hard to be quirky and while I get the author’s attempts at mixing heartbreak and comedy for me it just didn't work and reading it was such a chore. I considered giving up at 50% but it’s a Blackman novel and I really wanted it to turn around but sadly for me this one was just too farcical. I especially hated the The Witness Interviews and found myself skimming through them.I didn’t enjoy the characters so really the book had no redeeming features for me. While I didn't like it I know I have friends who will love this one and I will be happy to pass it on. I am glad that this book is bringing joy to so many readers as it’s been a tough few months and humour is the best medicine. For readers who enjoy quirky and humorous novels you may love Anxious people."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26560207-gabby,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book has restored my faith in humanity. It’s 1am and I just finished reading this book, and I really enjoyed it. Fredrik Backman is such an incredible author, he has such a great way with words and I love that he can write such a light-hearted story about such a serious subject. Here are some notes I jotted down while reading, as well as some of my favorite quotes: tw: suicide, death of a loved one, depression, suicidal thoughts •The way this book talks about anxiety and depression just really hit me, it was all so relatable •This book feels so light-hearted but it deals with such heavy subject matter, and I just love his writing, not many authors can have this perfect balance like this •I love the relationship between the father and son who are both cops, they were so soft and adorable •All the characters are so well fleshed out•I like the way the timeline jumps back and forth and includes interview clips •The audiobook is fantastic •The ending made me tear up a bit 😭•I love the theme of this book: we are all just doing our best and nobody really knows what we are doing •”Our hearts are bars of soap that we keep losing hold of; the moment we relax, they drift off and fall in love and get broken, all in the wink of an eye. We’re not in control.” •I love the discussion in this book about parenthood and how far parents will go to keep their children safe, and I love the quote: “parents are defined by their mistakes” because I think it’s super thought provoking and interesting •”It’s so damn difficult to admit that something is... broken. That it’s an ache is our soul, invisible lead weights in our blood, an indescribable pressure in our chest. Our brains are lying to us telling us we’re going to die”"
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102159719-reading-tamishly,Rating 5 out of 5,"Well, this book is one of his best so far. One of his most popular books didn't work for me. But I had a right vibe about this one and I was so, so, so crazy about its release ever since I saw the cover reveal. And yes, this book is going to be adapted as a TV series! I mean just do it 🖤The story is about, yes, a few idiots who got in a weird situation while checking out an apartment (for that matter a not-so-functional cheap one). An idiotic bank robbery attempt with the bank robber ending up with a real estate agent, an old lady, a lesbian couple - one of them pregnant, another couple always in a fight mode, a rabbit man (don't ask me how he fits here), two more characters who works in banks. Two police officers trying to crack the identity of the bank robber. A most likely hostage situation. A most unlikely outcome. Lots of pizza love sharing. Lots of more love and support for the culprit. But anyone can be the culprit. And yes, that's the plot. I cannot believe I would ever read a book like this which I would whole heartedly cheer for the culprit. And you will know why the characters in the book do too. This is such a heartwarming and, yes, a heartbreaking read (as always with his books!). I didn't cry while reading the book. But the last page broke me. And yes, I felt the 5 🌟 tears when the book ended. The writing is full of dry humour, satirical and yes, trying at times. Now and then I felt so bored (yes, why?! How come?!). You might feel the same as well. I assure you it's been deliberately written this way. And oh, you will be so glad you didn't skip these parts. Otherwise, don't tell me I didn't warn you, you might go back to these pages to get the best out of this read. But yes, pay attention to the details. Pay attention to the irritating, annoying behaviour and dialogues of these certified idiots. You won't regret knowing them.Partly suspenseful, partly investigation room drama, partly hostage scenario, partly dramatic and partly narrations of each of these characters and partly how their biggest life issues get resolved in the end, this book is so incredibly well written. Not all stories are with answers, not all marriages are made in heaven, not all father-son relationship is that amazing, not all perfect stories are perfect. This story represented well our shortcomings, our disparities, our faults, our adult lives which aren't so perfect. The characters represent well our weaknesses and strengths, our disappointments and then what we could do to actually become who we are. I just love how character driven this story is. Multiple characters that work out really good. I say, amazingly written.Each of the character has been well represented. There's both character growth and the plot is well etched out. The ending is almost like a fairy tale. It's perfect. Trigger warnings for suicide and suicidal acts, anxiety, infidelity.Treat yourself with this book! I love both the Atria and the Penguin editions!!!🖤I was so so so anxiously waiting for this one 🧐😳😲 and yes, this book is sooooo well done!!!! I am so happy I ended up rating it a perfect 5 🌟 a day after reading it. And I am so glad I didn't write the review just after I finished reading it."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 5 out of 5,"Fredrik Backman demonstrates with style and panache his remarkable and astute understanding of what it is to be human in this profound and philosophical locked room mystery that beguiles in how it pulls at our heartstrings, with its emotionally charged heartbreak, tragedy, humour and in the joy of human connectivity. He creates a host of stellar and diverse characters, including a rabbit, anxious, with messy and chaotic lives, and their idiocy, not only their idiocy, but all of our idiocy too. This is the perfect read for our troubled times, resonating deeply at so many levels, and if you don't connect with it immediately, I urge you to stick with it, the pay off will come in spades. When everything goes wrong for a bank robber, he ends up holding a group of hostages at an apartment viewing.In this character driven narrative, with its maze like twists and turns, there are surprises as we learn of the stories of these characters, each of whom are skilfully developed. When the police storm the apartment, the bank robber has disappeared, what happened? The characters are interviewed, but all to little avail. Backman's storytelling is full of hope in how it zeroes in on the state of the human soul, outlining the incomparable value of kindness, understanding, humanity, forgiveness and compassion in a world of human idiocy. I found this novel to be reading of the highest order, so entertaining, with the ability to make you laugh and cry. It is a touching novel that cements Backman's reputation as a terrific must read author, smart, offbeat and imaginative. I have no hesitation in recommending this highly, I have no doubt I will be returning to it, time and time again in the future. Many thanks to Penguin Michael Joseph for an ARC."
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m,Rating 4 out of 5,"4+ starsI was anxious to read this book, good anxious, as in I couldn’t wait to read it. Fredrik Backman has been on my list of favorite authors since I read A Man Called Ove several years ago. I’ve have read all of his published books and I loved all of them. But when I started reading this one, I became anxious in another way. I was anxious because I thought I was going to end up not liking the book. It’s kind of a quirky story, bizarre at times. The narrator even says , “The whole thing is a complicated, unlikely story. Perhaps that’s because what we think stories are about often isn’t what they’re about at all. This for instance, might not actually be the story of a bank robbery, or an apartment viewing, or a hostage drama. Perhaps, it isn’t even a story of idiots. Perhaps this story is about a bridge.” ( From an advanced copy.)A failed bank robbery that turns into an apartment hostage situation and it felt just a bit over the top, but then, as he always does, Backman sneaks up on you and you’re laughing one minute and heartbroken the next and ultimately your heart is stolen. I’m not even going to try to relay the plot here. Fans of Backman will want to read it for themselves. I will say, though, that I definitely was not disappointed and in the end, my anxiety was unwarranted. Its moving and reflective of Backman’s astute sense of humanity. A humanity in all of its glory as these characters share their anxieties over the burdens that life doles out, and they open their hearts to each other. I was reminded of the parental love and anxiety over children that we saw in the Beartown books, of relationships between a parents and children, of relationships between husband and wives. There’s some of the same seemingly simple prose conveying something more meaningful than at first glance in this novel as in the others. The relationships that developed between strangers were perhaps the most poignant. Connections slowly unfold between characters and I felt myself slowly connecting to all of them, especially the bank robber. This felt personal and philosophical in many ways. The intimate tone reminded me of Things My Son Needs to Know about the World. I loved that Backman created these characters who made me believe at a time when I needed believing, that there just might be people who will do something even if it seems they shouldn’t, just because it’s the right thing to do. I received an advanced copy of this book from Atria Books . A special thanks to Ariele Fredman."

I have only read one other book by this author and it was Ove. I am probably the only person on this earth that didn't enjoy that book. I was like what is all the fuss about? Umm yeah ...THIS....this right here is what all the fuss is about. This author is absolutely brilliant to be able to put this story together in the manner that he did. I am going to say one thing...Kevin Bacon...Nope Kevin Bacon is not in this book, but just keep that in the back of your mind...Let me know if you get it after you read this. Why did I love this book so much? Oh my gosh, there are sooo many reasons. It was so amazingly clever that you would be reading along thinking you knew exactly what was going on...and then I would literally stop dead in my tracks and go OMG...wow...really? Yet it all made perfect sense. It is such a well thought out progression throughout the story, that it simply amazes me that someone can dig in that deep and produce that for us. Yes, yes, I am now a fangirl, I admit.Here's a little what to expect without spoiling anything for you, because you will never forgive me if I did! Expect a bank robber who attempts to rob a cashless bank.. Hmm okay bank robber, I had no idea that was a thing either, so I am right there with you. The ""worst hostages ever."" Man these hostages were entertaining. A guy wearing a rabbit costume (only the head) standing in his underwear smoking a cigarette. Yep that is an example of your hostages! SO entertaining, with a witty, snarky, dry humor...little snippets by the author- telling us not to think about cookies, aww now I want a cookie. We really got to see what made each character in the book tick. The character development was superb! The story was so unique, that piece by piece it fell into place.It constantly kept turning out one surprise after another. Super clever. ❤️Obviously....I loved it! Grab a copy as soon as you can, this is a must read! I can't thank Atria Books enough for this ARC in exchange for an honest review. This book knocked my socks off!"
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464046-porshajo,Rating 2 out of 5,"Oh this one pains me, but I'm going to be the outlier on it. I am a fan of Backman. Read a number of his books, saw him speak in person about one of them, and even got to meet him and get a photo with him. Great speaker, engaging, and nice guy, the photo was his suggestion. When I saw he was to have a new book out, again I bugged my library so long ago about....and when it arrived I was number one in the queue. I dropped my other reads and immediately started it. And along the way....I almost DNF'd it.This one is the story about a bunch of idiots. Ok, so many reviews out there I'll just say there is a bank robbery that goes wrong. There are a bunch of people, idiots, who all come together for this story bringing in topics such as suicide, loniness, grief, cancer, love, anxiety, and more. Oh yeah and a hostage situation. With bumbling police. And, it was just too much, over the top for me. The 'interviews' the police tried to conduct with the witnesses were just obnoxious. I really didn't believe that all of these people treated the police like this and just would not answer them, just unbelievable. (Not that I believe people actually fly on magical brooms and play quiddich, but just different for me.) Perhaps this wasn't the right time for me to read this one. Perhaps I'm starting to gravitate away from Backman. I wasn't supper joyed with Beartown #2.I will also say I listened to the audio and it drove me nuts. The narration made the characters sound extra obnoxious, just waaaaaay over the top. It's funny, this narrator did another book this year which I absolutely adored and loved, loved, loved the narration. Just not for this one. Perhaps if I read print it might have been slightly different, not really sure. So why did I keep reading? Well,when I thought of DNFing and saw 213 people waiting I thought, finish it, it's just you. So I did, and I'm sure it's just me, or just not the right time.....but I will check out more from Backman in the future. Give it one more try."
25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5463364-david-putnam,Rating 4 out of 5,"This author has a great talent and I will read anything he writes.I loved, loved A Man Called Ov so maybe my expectations were set a little too high on Anxious People. I did enjoy this book a great deal and would recommend it to anyone. The concept is unique, a bank robbery investigated by a father and son and their conflicts. This would’ve been five stars had the backstory of “The bank robber,” not been in second person. This structure not only stopped the forward motion of the story but for me it was like fingernails on a chalkboard. I have no problem with first person, third person and third person close, second person tossed me out of the story and held me at arm’s length.In the first part of the book the author doesn’t stay with anyone character long enough for the reader to relate to them. For me this is critically important for establishing what I need most out of a book, The Fictive Dream, a state where I become immersed in the story. During the opening pages of most books authors are tasked with endearing the reader to the character, what I’ve heard described as, “Patting the head of the dog.”The big reason this book works and is so popular is the author’s credibility, he is a wonderful talent who readers trust implicitly and are willing to give him a few pages to set up the story. The book really digs in on page 107 so hold out a little longer if tempted to put it down, you won’t regret it. Four out of five stars.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson Series"

Because we’re doing the best we can, we really are. We’re trying to be grown-up and love each other and understand how the hell you’re supposed to insert USB leads. We are looking for something to cling onto, something to fight for, something to look forward to. We’re doing all we can to teach our children how to swim”. Love Fredrik Backman? Long time fan? Me too!New to Backman? His stories ... in the most raw sense of the word....are about humanity! “How do you manage to have such a long marriage? she asked”.  “You fight for it, Estelle replied honestly”.  “Julia didn’t seem to like that quite as much”.  “That doesn’t sound very romantic”.  “Estelle grinned knowingly.  “You have to listen to each other all the time. But not ‘all’ the time. If you listen to each other ‘all’ the time, there’s a risk that you can’t forgive each other afterward”.  “And that’s the weirdest thing about being someone’s parent. Not just a bank robber parent, but any parent: that you are loved in spite of everything that you are. Even astonishingly late in life, people seem incapable of considering that their parents might not be super- smart and really funny and immortal. Perhaps there’s a biological reason for that, that up to a certain age a child loves you unconditionally and hopelessly for one single reason: you’re theirs. Which is a pretty smart move on biology’s heart, you have to give it that”. Fredrik Backman has an exceptional keen eye ...a brilliant light touch... for the way that tragic, comic, and tenderness mingle together. This book reminded me of how short life really is. During our journey we see changes, possibly the truth, hopefully love, and an openness for reconciliation. ...Touching and relatable .......Beautiful, quirky, playful, compelling, urgent, funny,and compassionate.

This is a story about a bank robbery, an apartment viewing, and a hostage drama. But even more it’s a story about idiots. But perhaps not only that.
I love each of the characters so damn much. They just stole my heart. This book is funny, sad, hopeful.... There is suicide. There is everything. I marked many pages. The book took me by surprise because I thought one thing was happening and things turned out so different and good and beautiful. This book also had me laughing on and off as well as the crying. I’ll leave a few more quotes and end it there. I look forward to reading this over and over. And I have to say, I wish I could find me a crazy, sweet group like this and be friends forever. 
""So now we all know each other! Lovely!"" Estelle declared, so delighted that she clapped her hands. And for such a slight person she could clap her hands surprisingly hard. Which isn’t a great thing to do in a room in which someone is holding a pistol, seeing as everyone thought that the sudden clap was a pistol shot and threw themselves down to the floor. The bank robber looked at the prone bodies in surprise, then, with a scratch of the head, turned to Estelle and said: ""Thanks. That was very helpful of you.""*Then Roger looked around for something heavy to attach the note to, and eventually found a round object that seemed just the right density. That was how the police came to hear someone shout from the balcony again, and when Jack looked up, a lime hit him on the forehead. From a distance, that makes one hell of a bump.

So it needs saying from the outset that it’s always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you can forget how idiotically difficult being human is.”Jack is having a really bad day. A police officer, he’s investigating a bank robbery that wasn’t a robbery, that led to a hostage situation and a missing perpetrator. The witness interviews all have a sense of “who’s on first?” to them. Well, his day might not be as bad as the bank robber’s, who might have been shot, but has gone missing and so who knows? “The bank robber undeniably had a point. Not that this is in any way defense. Bank robbers, they can have bad days at work, too. Hand on heart, which of us hasn’t wanted to pull a gun after talking to a twenty year old?”This book is much more broadly humorous than his other works. But he still deals with all the important issues - the anxiety a parent feels worrying about a child, the anxiety one sibling has when another goes off the rails, the anxiety of being an adult, even the anxiety a stranger has for another soul in agony. I love Backman’s way of looking at the world, his ability to express things so perfectly. “Suddenly, you find yourselves living alongside each other, not with each other.” I found myself highlighting all sorts of passages, big and small. Backman employs an unknown narrator to talk to the reader, which works really well. The narrator actually empathizes not just with the characters, but with us, because we all share the same emotions, desires and needs. There are lots of laughs here, but also crying. Keep the hankies handy. I loved the ending and the twists that Backman used. It’s especially poignant that Backman lost a friend to suicide and has suffered from panic attacks.My thanks to netgalley and Atria Books for an advance copy of this book.Update - reading this for book club and it’s equally impressive the second time around. And I love the way he has the narrator speak directly to the reader, like breaking through the fourth wall in plays. "
29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26175098-christine,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 starsOK, so according to the author, this book is about a botched bank robbery, an apartment open house, and a hostage situation. That’s it. And most everyone in the story is an idiot. Again, author’s words. Does this sound like a must-read to you? No? It certainly doesn’t to me either. But I read it because I have faith in said author to deliver a great story no matter how boring the premise. Did I like it? Yes, I did. I actually loved it. And I loved it enough to put it in my potential “best book of the year” category (which only has one other book in it so far). Wow, this author. Fredrik Backman sure understands the human struggle. The struggle to survive, to connect, to love, to do the right thing by others, and to just live a decent life. He could take an empty room with white-washed walls, beige carpeting, no windows, and two people and turn the scene into a Pulitzer prize-winning novel. And he does it with humor. Ridiculous humor—my kind of humor. I laughed out loud many times during this story but cried throughout the last several chapters, which served brilliantly as the epilogue. Early on I read one of his novellas. I think I gave it a two-star rating. What the hell was wrong with me then? I never reread anything, but I’m going to reread that novella and see what I think of it now. More than 2 stars worth, I’m sure. This story is chock full of fascinating characters, 12 in all, I believe. Most of them are misfits—anxious misfits, and it was so captivating to follow them through this essentially one-day story. All at the same time this book is compelling, heartfelt, inspiring, and ridiculous. I can’t write well enough to really give this novel its due. Just trust me when I say you need to read it. It will be good for your soul.Thank you Net Galley, Atria Books/Simon and Shuster, and Fredrik Backman for allowing me to read an ARC of this book. Opinions are mine alone and are not biased in any way. "

31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26424937-lori,Rating 5 out of 5,"MY FAVORITE BOOK OF 2020I didn't want this to end so I read it a second time and some parts more than that, and I'm sad that it's time to call time, but it is.This is a the story of a bank robber who, oops, tries to rob a cashless bank then panics, runs across the street and right into a realtor's apartment viewing, panicking even more and taking everyone there hostage. The opening sentence of ""Beartown"" is one of my favorite opening sentences of all time. The opening paragraph of ""Anxious People"" is great but it's the first sentence of the second paragraph that I love best (advance copy disclaimer): ""This story is about a lot of things, but mostly idiots."" ""Anxious People"" is all about idiots, and that's us -- and if you think you're not an idiot, I won't argue with you because you're an idiot. We're not idiots all the time. We're not heroes all the time. We don't do the right thing all the time. We do our best and some days can't even manage that. ""Anxious People"" is hilarious except when it's not. There's a mystery and the entire book reminds me of a slide puzzle in that you think you get what's happening but not until every last piece is in place can you see the entire picture. It has twists and surprises until the very end. The characters are terrific. The hostages include a very pregnant and thus cranky lesbian and her earnest spouse, one of those people who seems to always manage to say the wrong thing; a buttoned-up banker; a sweet and slightly enigmatic elderly lady and a bored older married couple whose idea of fun is going to Ikea. And the rabbit, ha. There's a terrific pair of cops. And pizza. I read the entire book twice but there's one part with pizza I've probably read ten times. There's also a bridge which the apartment looks out on, which has been the scene of suicide and attempted suicide. And there's a therapist, because for those who think they can't handle things but can and those who think they can but can't, those who've been affected by someone else's jump and those who think about doing it, therapy can be the bridge back to the safe mainland of a mind at rest. ""Anxious People"" is funny, moving and delightful. Frederik Backman can do it all, make a hockey game the most important one of your life not just theirs, make a hostage crisis entertaining and meaningful. He's clear-eyed, witty, understands human nature very well and has a generous heart. He's such a gifted writer we start getting to know his characters quickly through a few lines of dialogue or a single action. With its short chapters and intervals of police interviews and therapy sessions, ""Anxious People"" moves at a quick pace. There wasn't a page where I didn't laugh out loud at least once and there were times I cried. I'm sad to move on and will end by plagiarizing the end of my review of another Backman book: Frederick Backman, you amaze. Heartfelt thanks to Ariele Fredman at Atria and to Atria for the advance MS."

""We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we're more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.""
Viewing an apartment normally doesn't turn into a life or death situation, but this particular open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes everyone in the apartment hostage. As the pressure mounts, the eight strangers begin slowly opening up to one another.This book is a key example of why it's good to push yourself out of your comfort zone with your reading. Nobody is more shocked than me at how much I loved this story. I cried, I laughed and then I cried some more. The writing in this book is so powerful. I am in awe of how cleverly this was written and the way all the characters stories were interwoven was just wonderful. 
""The whole thing is a complicated, unlikely story. Perhaps that's because what we think stories are about often isn't what they're about at all.""
This quote perfectly sums up Anxious People. Although it may seem like it has a ridiculous plot, it's not about the plot at all, it's about people and life and how difficult it can be to just be alive sometimes.The characters are flawed but also extremely loveable. I found each of them so interesting and felt so invested in them all. Each character had their own load to carry and each of them were struggling in their own ways, I loved the way this book emphasised that you truly never really know what's going on in someone's life, so you should always be kind.My highest recommendation"

Its both funny and heartbreaking, but also very weird/quirky/ and downright strange!!I really enjoyed the first chapters and the build up of what was happening with the hostage situation in the apartment complex. I did struggle as the book progressed and some parts were so silly to me that I couldn't imagine how this book was going to come together to make any sense, but in the end it does. You have to be quite a talented author to weave a puzzle like this one.Favorite chapters involved the police interviewing witnesses. They really had a time getting any of the characters to give them a straight answer.  A crazy tale and there is a lot to tackle with as far as themes, but I think Backman fans will enjoy. I hope to read more from this author.Thanks to Atria for my review copy! Out on Sept 8, 2020"
34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70046142-elle,Rating 3 out of 5,"I’m beginning to suspect that Backman’s writing isn’t generally for me. Beartown is likely the exception instead of the rule here, which is a disappointment. But based off of a lot of the positive feedback it seems I��m in the minority with this opinion.I feel as though, stylistically, Anxious People tried too hard to walk the line between whimsy and emotional depth and ended up not succeeding with either. It got to the point where I would have to skim over the first paragraph of every chapter because he was so unnecessarily wordy. It just became so incredibly grating. If you haven’t read any of Fredrik Backman’s books before, here’s my impression of the beginning of a chapter: ‘The sky is blue. Though I suppose you could call it cobalt, even indigo on some days. Occasionally azure is thrown around, but nobody is quite sure why. But if we’re nitpicking, today it was probably more of a sapphire. Although, most people are not, picky I mean, and will simply refer to the sky as blue. That’s not to say anything one way or another about these people, but is does make one wonder why that is. Why do some see the world in shades of blue, but when others look upward they merely gaze into a monochromatic abyss?Anyways, Doug drowned in the periwinkle sea.’The portions that were supposed to be emotional ended up falling flat, mostly because all of the characters were intentionally obnoxious and aggravating. My god, I have never cared less what happened to a fictional group of people. Tragic backstories were doled out one after the other to try to make you empathize with them. Each irritating member of this ensemble was also in turn revealed to be ‘like super deep and introspective, actually!’ and I couldn’t help but roll my eyes at the lame one-liner set-ups.I think the author did pull off a couple of good twists, and he’s really skilled at using the reader’s assumptions against them. But in all, I don’t think this is my kind of book. Everything’s a little too idiosyncratic, and it all wraps up a little too nicely. But if you’re looking for a vague sense of hope or whatever, I think you might still enjoy Anxious People.*Thanks to Natalie for this review copy!! 💙💙💙**For more book talk & reviews, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!"

”that’s the power of literature, you know, it can act like little love letters between two people who can only explain their feelings by pointing at other people's.”

fredrik backman just speaks to my soul. i don’t know how else to put it. never in my life have i read a more relatable and more thought provoking book. it has genuinely altered my view of the world and of others. i cannot say that about many books. but this was phenomenal. 
”it’s always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is.”
this book made me question myself. it challenged my thinking. it made me empathize with those i never thought i could. it made me look so much deeper into myself. it calmed me, it broke me, it healed me, it changed me. this is a book that stays with you. it’s about so many things yet about one thing. we have so many interwoven stories. its about a bank robbery, an apartment viewing, a hostage situation. also a love story, a mental health story, a story about grief and guilt. but ultimately, it’s about what it means to be human. backman captures the essence of this; the very essence of who we are at our core. 
”we need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. that we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.”
the book was executed in a very unique way. it went nothing like how i expected it to go. i actually wasn’t sure how i was going to feel about it after the first few pages but then i realized it kept creeping into my thoughts and it honestly puzzled me. something about the whole ordeal. this is definitely a book where you have to trust the process. i found myself getting so emotional very early on, as is the case with every backman novel. and even though i wasn’t sure where exactly we were going with the story, i just felt so connected to it. each character brought something different to the story. and you can learn something from every one of them. i see myself coming back to read this book again and again. i already miss these characters. this is such a special book. you should read it too. 
“it’s such an odd thing, the way you can know someone so perfectly through what they read.”

The characters were absolutely insufferable and I was struggling to care about anything that was happening. HOWEVER, as the book went on, I really grew to love all of the characters and ended up sobbing my way through the last 10% of the book. While I did end up really liking this one in the end, it definitely did have it's issues. Not only with the rocky first half, but there were also a lot of weird insensitive jokes that definitely could have just.. not happened? and the book wouldn't have suffered without them. But overall, this book and these characters snuck themselves inside my heart and I am SO glad that I read it. If you can handle the subject matter (this book deals VERY heavily with suicide and suicidal ideation), I definitely think this is worth the read.

Beartown though, called to me and I loved it and everything else he has written since. Just how it goes sometimes.He has a very distinctive writing style, and yes he is witty, but so much more. He gas a remarkable insight into people, their doubts, motives, the things they use to cover up the things they can't face.

Anxious People's somewhat mysterious plot is centered around a fabulous cast of characters. Backman's fluid writing style with this character-driven novel about human nature has laugh-out-loud moments, frustrating moments - even darker/sadder moments. I enjoyed following the dialogue on this audiobook as I grew to appreciate every character along the way. If you enjoy reading character-focused stories, then I highly recommend this book!P.S.

""Worst hostages ever.""
A bank robbery that never becomes a bank robbery. A hostage situation that might not be a hostage situation. Yet, there is intent, a mask, and a gun involved. Eight stranger's anxieties that are all in one apartment viewing when a masked individual walks in, a suicide, a psychologist, and two cops trying to get to the bottom of it all, becomes the perfect mixture for a good novel.Surprisingly funny and sad with moments of revelation is what Anxious People delivers to this reader. I became engrossed in the life of these people. How fate has put them all together in one place to bring out all of their issues into the open. Anxiuos People has a true message. A good person can make a bad decision. Should the bad decision define us? Should we get a second chance? We have all been ""idiots"" at one point. Right?I encourage people to read this book. It is not the usual prose I'm used to but it works nonetheless.Cliffhanger: No4/5 FangsA complimentary copy was provided by Atria Books via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.MrsLeif's Two Fangs About It | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram"

I loved Beartown, Us Against You and Britt-Marie was here - all by Backman. But this novel didn’t have the same feel for me at all. I didn’t find the characters funny or endearing I found them infuriating. The way they spoke to the police officers and to each other - I just wasn’t enjoying myself at all. I know I am in the minority here. Massively. But I still love Backman, I’m not going to rate this one.

As a senior college student where I’m expected to be an adult and have everything figured out I felt deeply affected by this book. Like this book somehow understands me. It just understands the anxiety humans feel everyday trying to do their best while they don’t even know what they’re doing.I loved the main idea about the book. That we are all just humans struggling trying to figure everything out. That “parents are defined by their mistake” even though they’re always trying their best. The author tackled heavy topics in a such a lighthearted way. And sometimes we need that balance. The ending was so freakin emotional.This is my first book by this author and I loved his writing. The book was so freakin quotable. I have pages highlighted. The authors’s writing is what made this book that good in my opinion. He clearly can write about humans and humanity in a really touching way. This is a story that would touch you. One where you can see yourself in it. No matter who you are, I feel like you’d still see a side of yourself in this story. Because in the end we’re all just humans. We are not that different.

That was the case for me with Anxious People. The message of the story is something I desperately needed to hear right now. Will everyone be a weepy mess like I was when I finished the book? Probably not, but I do think it is going to hit home with quite a few people. While this was my first book I have read by this much loved author, it certainly won't be my last.The premise sounds fairly simple but yet the author created a complex tale. A bank robber holds a group of people hostage in an apartment building. After a standoff the hostages are released. Police enter the apartment but they can't find the bank robber. What happened? Well, police conduct interviews with the witnesses to get answers.The author has a bit of a quirky writing style which took me a few chapters to get used to but I did grow to love it. I think a story like this could have gotten out of hand and over the top very easily but the author did a nice job staying in bounds. It wasn't too much of a stretch of my imagination to believe in the characters and plot. There's heart to the story which was a nice balance to the humorous parts.While some readers are big on underlining quotes or marking them to read again later in books, I rarely do it. Maybe once a month or so I find a line that sticks with me and I want to revisit it later. With this book, I have six pages in which I doggy eared the page so I could go back and read the parts that strongly resonated with me. What I find amazing about this story is there's enough here in which each reader might pull something different from it. If you are asking each reader what was the message of the story the answers could vary. I found myself reflecting on my life while reading the book and when you have the opportunity to do that, it's often a meaningful reading experience which was the case here.

The entire book is written in a rambling, conversational style. Backman somehow finds a way to use about four times as many words as necessary to describe every detail of the plot. And then it gets repeated again.Apparently this book is supposed to be a comedy. It is certainly filled with many attempts at humor, but the humor isn't even groan-worthy. The same lame jokes get repeated over and over again. They aren't funny the first time, let alone the second, or third, or fourth...I realize that I have a contrarian viewpoint on this book. The chatty writing style annoyed me from the first page to the last, and the humor consistently fell flat.

""That’s the power of literature, you know. It can act like little love letters who can only explain their feelings by pointing at other people’s.

That quote is gold. This quote is basically book reviewing in a nutshell. Instead of putting my feelings into words, I'm just like.
So, what's this book about?
This is a poignant comedy about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined.Viewing an apartment normally doesn’t turn into a life-or-death situation, but this particular open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes everyone in the apartment hostage. As the pressure mounts, the eight strangers slowly begin opening up to one another and reveal long-hidden truths.As police surround the premises and television channels broadcast the hostage situation live, the tension mounts and even deeper secrets are slowly revealed. Before long, the robber must decide which is the more terrifying prospect: going out to face the police, or staying in the apartment with this group of impossible people.This book was genuinely one of the weirdest yet most endearing mix of heartbreak and comedy that I have ever read.FIrst, I have to talk about the absolute ridiculousness contained within this book. From page one, I could tell that I had to suspend my disbelief. Backman writes with a distinct voice and fills his books with humor. Although the book is mostly realistic, there are a few moments that make you tilt your head or quirk an eyebrow. You just gotta take it with a grain of salt.But somehow this book also manages to brilliantly turn on a dime to heartbreak within mere sentences. There were so many heavy themes but the most obvious ones were suicide and parenthood. Backman did an amazing job at balancing sad with happy and vice versa. I think my favorite part of this book was the forking brilliant plot twists. The were amazing for so many reasons. They packed the punch of a big end of the book plot twist but there were several scattered throughout the book. They were brilliantly revealed in one. freaking. sentence. I really can't say more without revealing anything but OMG, I gasped aloud multiple times.Overall, I giggled, gasped and teared up. This book is brilliant and I highly recommend everyone read it.If you need someone,

53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63168028-peter,Rating 5 out of 5,"TroubledIt is a unique reading experience with Fredrik Backman, and it often takes a few chapters to appreciate a special journey is underway. Sometimes the humour and dialogue feel unusual but once into the novel, his turn of phrase becomes entertaining and revealing of the characters. Anxious People, like the stalled elevator scenario, poses characters that are trapped in a confined location, and as they settle in for a long wait, individual stories of different influences and choices that led them to that moment are intriguingly revealed. A past where backgrounds are unknowingly crossed sets up a future that will be altered over the next few hours. Each person will be compelled to change their relationships and the direction they were travelling. I am always intrigued by the interpretations and perspectives different people can apply to the same situation. How perspectives can affect how we deal with incidents and how we harbour issues that shape how we deal with future events. Backman serves up compelling observations on human interactions and relationships with an edge of anticipation. A bank robber attempts to hold-up a cashless bank for exactly six thousand five hundred kronor. The strange behaviour and apparent naivety foster a mystery and deeper anxiety for the bank robber. Even when the bank robber runs into an apartment during a viewing with an estate agent, and holds eight people hostage, our empathy remains with the bank robber. The personal stories unfold with great fascination and sentiment, and we often wonder what the central theme of the novel is. 
 “The truth? It’s hardly ever as complicated as we think. We just hope it is, because then we feel smarter if we can work it out in advance. This is a story about a bridge, and idiots, and a hostage drama and an apartment viewing. But it’s also a love story. Several, in fact.” 
 When all hostages are released, the police storm the apartment, but by then it is empty. The mystery is widened when the perspective of two detectives, father and son, Jim and Jack, are introduced and periodically told through their eyes. Each with their own private circumstances and motives that influence how they react.There is a wonderful wordplay around the fact that this story is based in Sweden and the reference made to Stockholmers – a term formally used to name people from Stockholm, a derogatory term of idiots used by many Swedes outside Stockholm and very aptly a term used in association with a particular Syndrome. It is more than just a word; it is an expression more than it is a place.Fredrik Backman has his own unique style and if variety appeals to you then slotting in a Backman book every now and again is a wonderful experience. He delivers the novel in an enthralling storytelling manner where he often talks directly to the reader and weaves humour with heartbreak.I would highly recommend this book and I would like to thank Penguin Michael Joseph UK and NetGalley for providing me with a free ARC in return for an honest review."

That's a question I asked myself before starting this book and, I believe, it's the best summary of this story! This the first book I've read by this author and it was different, creative, fun, and so much more than I expected. It's a story full of emotions running wild, several twists you don't expect, and an odd but interesting mix of characters. This eclectic group of individuals, who, in the best of circumstances, would never have reached out to one another, make the best of their situation and begin initiating unlikely friendships. It's an amazing transformation to witness. There are memorable and important themes to take away from this story: strangers connecting in unexpected ways; feelings of empathy for unforeseen circumstances of others; giving and receiving kindness and hope; learning to reach out for help; taking a chance by offering second chances. It's a mixed bag that, down deep, makes sense in so many ways and feels good to read!For me, this story would feel over-the-top and the writing would sound completely ridiculous 'if' Marin Ireland wasn't the one narrating the audiobook. Her talented voicing makes it all sound so logical, normal, and I have to admit I enjoyed having a second-person voice, such as hers, guide me through this story. Let's face it, none of us lead completely stress-free lives, right? We've all been a little anxious about something or someone in our lives at one time or other. Offering kindness and reaching out could be good things to do, so don't be an idiot or let someone else be an idiot either! “Bridges exist to bring people closer together..."" ~ Fredrik Backman4.25 stars!"

No começo estava bem empolgada, rindo com o tom da narrativa irônica e me surpreendendo com a quantidade de camadas que a história poderia ter. Afinal, eu descobri a história da Zara (a melhor personagem, e a única que recebeu o mínimo de aprofundamento). A verdade é que depois o tom irônico passou a ser a voz de todos os personagens. Todos. E foi aí que parei de achar graça. Onde toda história se baseava em um tom de desrespeito. Que mesmo com a revelação (o tal do ""TUDO faz sentido no final""), eu não fui surpreendida.

Fredrik Backman never ceases to amaze me and here he amazed, by the way, he took hard painful truths, added some comic relief and create a profound, complicated, enlightening entertaining brilliant story. He has an amazing understanding of what makes us humans and a way with words to create one of the most human stories I have read. This is a story that you might think you know what it is about, but often stories are not what we think they are about. This story is about a lot of things. It might seem like an unlikely story about idiots and anxious people that at times feels a little over the top but is really a story about something different. It might be a story about a bank robbery gone wrong that ends with an apartment viewing with idiots who are anxious. Maybe the bank robber is just an idiot or maybe things are just really complicated. Maybe this is a story that explores what is under the surface of what we think we see or know about someone. Maybe this is just an entertaining story or maybe under the layers is a profound story. Backman creates a diverse group of characters with their differences and slowly reveals the differences and motivations of the characters with each chapter. He explores the kind of truths people hide, the true stories about themselves and he shows us with a little compassion and kindness people slowly start to reveal those truths. Maybe it's a story about what it's like to be human in a world full of idiots who just might be anxious people just trying to survive in a loud world. I highly recommend reading to find out for yourselves what you think this story is about. This was a Travelling Friends Group read and makes for a great group discussion. Talking about my shelves or maybe to myselfI have added this one to my diverse shelve because the characters are diverse in their differences and experiences.It is a good representation for mental health and suicide. I have added a new shelve world settings to challenge myself to read books set in different parts of the world. The story is set in Sweden.I received a copy from the publisher on NetGalley!"

“Boats that stay in the harbor are safe, sweetheart, but that’s not what boats were built for.”

I am a huge fan of Backman’s book and it is no surprise that Anxious People was one of my most anticipated books of the year and I am so happy to assure you all that it did not disappoint me. There is something magical about Backman’s book that I can’t explain. They just work so well for me and give me a huge dose of serotonin.The synopsis is weird. I don’t know how to explain the story because during the story itself, the story will tell you it is a story about a bridge, but also about a rabbit. It is a story about a bank robber but it is also a story about a bunch of strangers. What I can tell you is that it is a story about humans, more like a human study as much as Backman’s other books are. I love how Backman always focuses on a group of people rather than one character and it is no different here. Initially we seem to have different pieces of a puzzle and as we progress everything falls into place until we have a beautiful final result.I love the writing because it is a mix of humor with life experience without being preachy. It is very light while kind of discuss heavy topics so the mix is very efficient. There sometimes seem to be some spoon feeding which we could have done without as readers but it is something minor and did not affect my enjoyment or love of the story. From the first few pages I stumbled upon this quote and I knew I am gonna like the book: 

“Sometimes it hurts, it really hurts, for no other reason than the fact that our skin doesn’t feel like it’s ours. Sometimes we panic, because the bills need paying and we have to be grown-up and we don’t know how, because it’s so horribly, desperately easy to fail at being grown-up.” 

The story began by mentioning the characters jobs and not their names and it stays like that for a short amount of time, I even expected not to have names but then we get to know all the characters back stories and names and I got to like and root for all of them. The characters are really very distinctive and quirky which is something I like very much. The characters feel real and that’s why I always get emotional when we get down to business as usual from Backman’s books. The characters are all connected one way or another and that is something I think is very real. The world is a small village and this was an example of that. This is not a romance story by the way but it has very cute romantic quotes and moments and it makes my heart melt. 

“He was my echo. Everything I do is quieter now,”

Summary: I feel this is a typical Backman’s story, if you read his other stories and liked them then this will most probably work for you, if they did not then this will probably not. If you want to start somewhere with his novels then this is not a bad place to start with. It is a poignant, touching story that will take you on a scale of all different emotions!"
61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james,Rating 4 out of 5,"Anxious People is the fifth book I've read by Fredrik Backman. It is his newest release, which I found on NetGalley (thank you), and I would definitely encourage others to read it. Backman is one of those authors who was meant to be an author -- he has a deep understanding of human nature, knows how to build suspense and emotion, and includes so many surprises in the plot. He also ensures you have a book hangover for days after finishing his work!A bank robber who really never meant to be a bank robber ends up escaping and holding a group of people hostage in an apartment viewing. It's all accidental, and the anxiety we see covers a cast of about ten main characters, each who comes at the story with a very different perspective. The tale weaves in and out, revealing connections and history, all the while moving the police interviews forward. The bank robber was never found. None of the hostages are talking about what happened in the end. And the two policemen seem to be at odds over who was responsible for which piece of the investigation. Something is definitely going on below the surface.When I began reading, it wasn't an immediate love. I found it choppy and meandering without enough clarity for me to latch on to. I later realized that was intentional and necessary. I should've known better in the beginning, as I was hesitating to read it the second day. While I adored three of his past books, one wasn't a good match, so I worried this was gonna end up that same way. Trust me, hang on... while there are a few sections that you can tell were intentionally confusing (not the best tool for an author to choose, but one that can work well in limited quantities), for the most part, it's very straightforward. It's just a matter of reading between the lines and figuring out what isn't being said.Imagine you are held hostage. The gun appears fake. The bank robber's story is an emotional one. You've got your own issues to deal with. They're all neurotic in their own ways... would you let the bank robber get away with it? No harm was done, other than the fear you might be hurt. But based on the way the events unfold, there really wasn't any danger, it seemed... so... maybe you might say ""Let the bank robber go"" if things turned out the same way for you. I don't know... I'm pretty big on people being held accountable for their actions. Not only did the bank robber try to rob a bank, fail, and then escape, but the bank robber also waved a gun at 7 or 8 people in an apartment viewing down the block and basically held them hostage. So that's two bad things, which means it's really a bit of an innate thing. That said, it was all for the same reason, and potentially a good one, but still.... I ramble. Backman does that to you.My biggest concern was the way many of the other people handled the situation. All a little contrived to some degree, but still entertaining and quite real in many aspects. I considered pushing up to a 4.5, but there were too many plot items that just didn't add up enough for me. So... I still say it's a must-read but you have to let go of your own anxieties and expectations and recognize this is more about people's neuroses and reactions, not whether this could've legitimately happened. When I do that, it's an easy 5 stars because Backman captures people's true nature better than no other author I know."

This book had so many funny moments that actually made me smile but it was also kind of emotional at times. It was just the perfect read for me!The mystery of the bank robbery was interesting. I also loved how the author connected the stories of the characters in such a seamless way. And the relationship between the father and son in this was so adorable and made me tear up a bit. I ended up loving all of the characters so much! This book touches on suicide, depression, anxiety and the difficulties of just being a human being with emotions. It was just such a beautiful story and I loved it so much! It did have me a bit confused in the beginning and it took me a little while to get into, but once I did, I really enjoyed it!"
64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell,Rating 3 out of 5,"[Thank you to the publisher for sending me an Advanced Reader's Copy of this book. All opinions expressed in this review are my own. The book will be available in the U.S. on September 8, 2020.]I've been a fan of Fredrik Backman's for a while now. When I first read most famous title  A Man Called Ove, I could tell there was something special to his work. And from there I think his books have only gotten better. He connects with readers through his poignant and reflective writing style that often muses on larger themes like the meaning of life, human connection, and love through the specific and often quirky stories of his characters. That definitely can be said of this novel as well.Anxious People tells the story of a bank robbery gone wrong. It ends up turning into a hostage situation in an apartment complex across from the bank, and the story picks up as we zoom in and out of the apartment into the lives of each of the characters involved. There's our bank robber, a few couples, one or two single individuals, and the cops that are handling (or attempting to handle) the situation. As with all of Backman's books, there is more than meets the eye in each of their lives and fate has a way of bringing together strangers in unlikely ways.My biggest problem with this book was the pacing. The first 100 pages or so are quite redundant. Every time we are introduced to a new character, the exposition felt the same as the previous one. And in between these character intros are interludes that bring us back to the present day hostage situation. There are also transcriptions of dialogues between the characters and the police as they are interviewing them that read quickly but lack depth. On top of that, some of the dialogue and the way people treat each other seemed too far fetched for me (even for a Backman book, this heightened drama seemed less relatable and significant than some of his other books). Perhaps some of these issues will be edited out by the time the book hits the shelves in a month or so (though I have no idea if that will be the case).Regarding the characters, I enjoyed reading about them but felt much more like an observer than a participant. With Backman's other books, especially his duology  Beartown and  Us Against Them, you can't help but feel invested in the lives of the characters, as if you are part of this small community. Here we see things on such a limited scope, and then are told, rather than shown, everything we need to know about the characters' backstories, that the usual connection I feel to Backman's work was lacking.Of course there are some great quotes to pull from this book about life and love and treating each other with kindness. That's to be expected from Backman at this point, and he delivers. But sadly that wasn't enough to really push this book up the list for me in terms of favorite Backman novels. I'm sure avid fans will still enjoy this one—and based on other early reviews for the U.S. edition and older reviews of the original Swedish version, my opinion seems to be an outlier. So take all of that with a grain of salt, and if you are interested in the story based on the premise alone, you will likely enjoy this one. If it's your first introduction to Backman, however, might I recommend diving into his backlist first as there is so much goodness and warmth to be discovered through his stories. This one, ultimately, fell a bit flat."
65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15662887-deanna,Rating 5 out of 5,"My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpr...All the stars!!!!! I have read a few of Fredrik Backman’s previous novels and really enjoyed them. However, this one is definitely my favorite. I had the audiobook and ebook. I thought both were excellent and I enjoyed alternating between them.This was a story about many different things.  This story starts with a bad idea, an almost robbery, and an unintentional hostage situation.But I mustn’t forget…It is also a story about idiots.The day before New Year’s Eve,  a 39-year-old wannabe bank robber attempts to rob a bank. When things don’t go as planned, the “robber” hurries away and runs up the stairs of a nearby building and into the first open door they see. An apartment that just happens to be filled with people. An apartment viewing has now turned into a hostage situation. The almost robber is very apologetic and tries to reassure the unintentional hostages that this wasn’t how it was supposed to go…. “I’m very sorry about that! I’m having quite a complicated day here!”Time passes and the tension in the apartment grows. The people inside start to share things about themselves and these revelations will have readers wondering what could possibly happen next!Did I already say how much I LOVED this book?Fredrik Backman has a terrific understanding of people and the things that connect us all. A writer who makes me laugh about the everyday things in life.To really enjoy this novel, readers may have to overlook things that seem unlikely.Some parts felt like they were written specifically for me. I am an anxious person and I'm occasionally an idiot who is just trying to get their chaos under control too.“Those of us who aren’t twenty can probably agree that most twenty-year-olds are wrong so often that most of them would have just a one in four chance of answering a yes or no question correctly.” My twenty-year-old daughter didn’t find that quote as hilarious as I did…Thought-provoking and intelligent with some excellent twists. A story about connections. A story about how one life affects another in a single moment. I frequently found myself laughing out loud and also got choked up a time or two (or five). It also has many unforgettable characters.QUOTES:Parenting --- “You’re always judged by your worst moments. You can do a million things right, but if you do one single thing wrong you’re forever that parent who was checking his phone in the park when your child was hit in the head by a swing.”Being an adult --- “The terrible thing about becoming an adult is being forced to realize that absolutely nobody cares about us, we have to deal with everything ourselves now, find out how the whole world works. Work and pay bills, use dental floss and get to meetings on time, stand in line and fill out forms, come to grips with cables and put furniture together, change tires on the car and charge the phone and switch the coffee machine off and not forget to sign the kids up for swimming classes.”I’m thrilled that there are books from this author that I haven’t yet read. I honestly can’t wait to check them out too.A unique, heartwarming, and unforgettable novel!I'd like to thank the publisher for providing me with a copy of this novel. All opinions are my own."
66,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8051792-lisa-ny,Rating 1 out of 5,"I have now officially fulfilled my lifetime quota of Fredrik Backman. This book annoyed me from the first page to the last - like fingernails scratching on a chalkboard. I kept expecting it to get better as it is loved by so many GR friends and real life friends who have similar taste in books as me. I do like his message, which is always the same - finding community - but I just can't stand the way he gets there. I can't believe I read the whole thing."
67,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34183387-regina,Rating 5 out of 5,"All aboard the Backman Train! Next stop, Neuroses. As someone who's lukewarm about this beloved author, I picked up Anxious People with a bit of trepidation. I get that he writes quirky characters. Sometimes they work for me, and sometimes they don't. A few chapters into his latest, I was ready to bail. I'm so glad I stayed with it though, because my heart warmed as the story unfolded. On the surface, this is a novel about a bank robbery gone wrong that led to a hostage situation. (It's like Backman is in on the joke: ""Hey, I'm from Sweden, how clever would it be to write a book about Stockholm Syndrome?"") But as you peel back the layers, it's really an exquisite character study about people just trying to do the best they can in a difficult world. Speaking of people, there are only two of them on the U.S. cover. That seems like an odd choice, because this definitely is not a two-person romantic tale as that might imply. Do yourself a favor and look at the covers from the other editions around the world. It's fun to see how the publishers felt this release should be marketed in various territories! I guess us anxious readers in the U.S. just need something that hints at love. "

Full of substance and underlying discussions on parenthood, marriage, friendship, community, social interactions, suicide, mental health,... everything. Without making it feel heavy to read.— overall thoughts: 4.5 —⇢ trigger warnings// attempted suicide, hostage situations
“it's so hard to think of the words when all you really wanna say is, I can tell you're hurting.”
That main timeline happens because of a hostage situation during an apartment viewing and even though that in itself might not sound appealing to most, that's really all I think you should know. Is it basically stockholm syndrome? I don't know, read to find out. The themes and discussions were really the selling point of the whole book, and how it was masterfully integrated into the plot.Incredibly humorous because god forbid that there be another perspective buyer (if you read it, you know). I love that there is something here for everyone. For anxious people and those that think that they aren't.
“most people are just looking for something to cling to, something to fight for.”
It truly is incredibly well-written with absurdity that makes sense. If this was a movie, it would be a comfort movie that I would rewatch again and again. Because sometimes we don't need a strong male and female lead to go off on an adventure across an unnamed land, we just need a couple of friends to eat pizza with in an apartment looking over a bridge while watching some fireworks.I was pleasantly surprised at the details of how each respective characters were acting that went into the apartment plot, it was all entirely believable. The characters were charming not because they were perfect and saying all the right things, but because of how they reflected sets of people that you might actually find (at an actual apartment viewing for one thing but also) in your own life. In some way, you get to know the characters in a way that they just grow on you. I also love the way the characters were connected behind the scenes of the hostage taking and we kind of knew it before they did.It has a simple plot written with intricate details that made it that much more endearing and cozy. This story was really about so many different things that it's hard to breakdown properly but I felt extremely satisfied with my reading journey. There are even short chapters for those of you that enjoy those.
“What we think a story is about, isn’t what they are about at all.”
And that’s why it was exactly my kind of story.My favorite aspect of the mystery was how it didn’t leave us until the last 20% of the story for the big plot twist and instead misleads us at the beginning of almost every chapter but tying it back at the end of the same chapter. It was just absolutely brilliant. It kept the pacing going and the reading experience exciting. I finished this within 24 hours.I somewhat saw the biggest twist coming but I didn't know exactly how it would turn out. And all the other mini plot twists blew my mind. The way everything connected and came together was so well executed that it brought happy tears to my eyes for once.↣ Read this when you need someone, or perhaps when you're a little sad. Actually, read it right now because we're in a pandemic and we're all a little sad. As the story tries to tell us, we're not all that different, we're all just trying the best that we can. ↢"
70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri,Rating 5 out of 5,"Desperation can lead many to unwise decisions and dim-witted actions, and that is, in part, what this story is about, but it’s also about so much more. It’s about a bank robbery, or rather an attempted bank robbery, which fails since the bank robber fails to notice that the bank does not carry cash. It is a “cashless” bank. Fleeing, but only after being mocked by the twenty-year old bank employee, because at that point running out of the bank seemed the only option to preserve one’s dignity – if any dignity remains at this point – the bank robber who did not actually rob anything ends up fleeing into a building, running up a flight upstairs and into an open viewing for an apartment up for sale, which is occupied by seven people. Well, eight once the bank robber arrives. An older couple who spend their time renovating / flipping homes for profit, as well as something to do together in their retirement years. Two women, a couple who are expecting their baby to be born at any moment, and seem to bicker just for the sake of … bickering. A woman, whose only interest in the apartment seems to be the distant view from the balcony, a view of the bridge. Another woman, one who has lived a long life and seems lost and somewhat alone even within this group of people. Oh, yes, and a rabbit – or a man partially dressed as a rabbit, anyway, as part of a ploy to dissuade potential buyers from wanting to buy this apartment. Eventually, there will be two policemen, a father and his son, who will wander into this story, a story that may change them, as well. Inside this story that is filled with many comic moments, some of Backman’s wonderfully wry wisdom seeps in, a perception of what makes people do the things they do, as well as what sometimes breaks them. Sometimes it’s a cycle that repeats, and occasionally someone reaches out a helping hand, and that’s all that is needed to let them know that they matter, that their heartbreaks and their happiness matter. To know that someone is listening, and actually hears is a powerful weapon against the kind of pain that leads to destruction, that just leads to more pain.Backman, once again, has taken seemingly unrelated puzzle pieces of human beings and put them together a little at a time until the full picture slowly takes shape. As always, a puzzle is an ever evolving picture until the last pieces are strategically, correctly placed, and you view the finished work of art and smile, knowing Backman is a master of his craft and has never let you down.

71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29919991-catherine-alternativelytitledbooks--very-behind-again,Rating 4 out of 5,"*Many thanks to Goodreads, Atria/Simon & Schuster, & Fredrik Backman for an ARC of this book!*Clever, touching, funny, and beautifully heartbreaking!This is the story of a bank robbery gone wrong. Or...is it an apartment showing gone wrong? Either way, a mysterious would-be bank robber stumbles into a motley crew of strangers all drawn to explore an apartment with one unique attribute---a bridge is clearly and directly visible from the window. This bridge serves as both a visual cue of connection between the here and there and also holds significant meaning for several of the apartment's quirky visitors. While the 'crime' unfolds upstairs, police officer father-son-duo Jim and Jack begin an investigation into the identity of the perpetrator. What they find, however, is how twisted and tangled the web of our humanity actually is, and the hostages begin to realize that this situation is much less a crisis than an opportunity to truly connect with the people around them.Backman's gift as an author lies in his examination and exemplification of the ordinary, the true, and the ties that bind us all. His novels always manage to walk the fine line between hilarious and improbable, while also acknowledging the wistful, sadder truths of our shared humanity. While his sense of humor might not be for everyone, I can't remember the last time I've laughed so often while reading what is ostensibly a novel exploring mental health on a real and visceral level. Backman's characters never feel preachy, overwrought, or artificial--they are all flawed, quirky, and REAL. This book also read like a play in my mind, and I think it could be highly adaptable for the stage, although narration would be essential at times to capture Backman's spirit. He manages the keep the identity of the bank robber a mystery for almost the entire book, but there is so much more to unpack here, that is hardly the point. I think that decision in and of itself was a clever device meant to get the reader to stop focusing on the who, what, where, and how, and really explore what lies between the lines.Backman once again feels like the wise friend I wish I had, teaching, exploring, and noticing everything about the world. I absolutely love his style, his writing, and this book will stick with me for some time. I already miss these characters, and Anxious People delivers the sort of hopeful, beautiful, and poignant message our world really needs right now. 4.5 ⭐️"

74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars, rounded up.Fredrik Backman's newest novel, 
Anxious People
, is poignant, thought-provoking, and a little bewildering.This is a story about a bank robbery and a subsequent hostage situation. But not really. I mean, these things happen and factor in the book but in the end, this is a book about connections, how desperate we are to be seen by others, and how even those who are supposed to help us in our time of need are sometimes in need of rescue as well.
Anxious People
 tells a story—many stories, really—in a very roundabout way. It travels from past to present, focusing on many different people, and their stories are juxtaposed with interviews between the police and the hostages. I felt as if the interviews were supposed to provide comic relief, but they were almost too outrageous and annoying that they frustrated me more than amused me.There are a lot of characters and situations to keep straight, and Backman throws lots of twists and turns into the story. I'll admit I had to go back and read some incidents again to make sure I was clear on what actually happened. But there is a lot of emotion here, too, and I think when Backman writes about the emotional connections we have—with loved ones, friends, strangers—and how they enrich and affect us in ways we might never know, he's found his sweet spot.I love the way Backman tells a story. (Two of his books, 
Beartown
 and 
Us Against You
, are among my favorite books from the last decade.) Even though this one didn’t completely click for me, my love of his writing won out. There was still a lot to love about this book.I’ve seen mixed things on this—some have given it 5 stars while others have struggled—but it’s definitely worth a read.Atria Books and Ariele Stewart provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

This book touched me in a totally different way. How can a book with so much depth and insight about human lives come with so much hilarity, leaving me lighthearted yet teary eyed at the same time?!This book was truly impactful and heartwarming. I adored all the characters and the way all their lives connect with each other towards the end was so satisfying. “We plant an apple tree today, even if we know the world is going to be destroyed tomorrow.”That has to be one of the most powerful sentences I’ve read in a while.

The basis of the story is a hostage situation after a failed bank robbery. But the hostages are in an apartment viewing across the street, where our bank robber ran to when they though the police were after them- after they attempted to rob a cashless bank. The story is told after this has taken place, when the police are interviewing all of the hostages & the teller, desperately trying to find out how the bank robber disappeared. We learn of the backstories of each of our hostages, the most difficult witnesses to ever be interviewed (in a clueless/trying sort of way), because they’re so much more than this one event. TW: cheating, suicide, depression, gunsEvery character was perfectly fleshed out. I never felt like I didn’t know the characters enough, instead feeling like I’d known them for ages. I love how their stories connected & the relationships that were in this. I loved getting to know this gang and trying to figure out who the bank robber was & where they’d gone. I think the mystery was perfectly solved, and the perfect end to the story. I actually don’t have a single thing I would change about this."

The interviews were so funny, and I was wondering what the heck was wrong with these people. I’m glad it made sense at the end though. All the characters were so interesting. NO, seriously, all the characters were freaking unique. I swear I’m so used to reading so many boring, flat characters and, then once in a while, I'm blessed with this book. I just want to be as bold as these characters are when someone is holding a gun nearby. I also love how the twists kept coming. They weren’t super shocking, but they still gave me the feeling of “Oh, I did not see that coming!” Are all Backman’s books this good? If yes, this bitch is about to go on a Backman book marathon. I also really loved the ending. It was all about people understanding each other, which is such a great lesson. Great job Backman!"

The hostages are eventually released after inevitably had pizza delivered - as that happens at every hostage situation, right? The police storm in, find blood but no robber. All the hostages are interviewed by police officers Jim and Jack a father and son, who are among others, anxious people. I love Bachman’s digressions which frequently aren’t, but it’s funny and is typical of how a mind flits from subject to subject. Well, mine does anyway! There are so many acutely pertinent and acutely observed statements about people, society, Stockholm (!) and Stockholmers, age gaps and social media among others. The writing is funny, emotional, heart breaking, heart warming, and moving in equal measure. The characters are fantastic, I especially like Estelle, the oldest hostage at 87. She’s fab. I have a sneaking admiration for London the bank clerk, who though rude, did provide so real laugh out loud moments. She’s ballsy too! What can I say about the hostage rabbit? Well, that’s an unusual image if nothing else, especially as he was trouserless!!!! That enters the realms of rather bonkers!! The interviews between Jack/Jim and the hostages are also barking, nuts, crazy but there is a reason ......... and I like it! The story is full of connections though you don’t initially see how they can possible be connected as they seem so random. Overall, a highly entertaining read that via zany humour makes some astute observations and keeps you interested throughout. With thanks to NetGalley and Penguin, Michael Joseph for the ARC."

It is a challenge to all of us to celebrate life, no matter how difficult, no matter how mundane. To reach out to others even when they are prickly and strange, to meet people where they are and let them into our lives and join them where they are.

Being a cop in this book is a tough job.I think that the mystery is not meant to be taken too seriously because it’s just a disguise, a setup, or a literary device to convey the real lessons, messages, and little takeaways about life and being a human this book wants you to find and resonate with. All the characters are distinguished, realistic, relatable, and funny.There may be some who feel the book’s witticism and offbeat-ness grating on their nerves. Especially, the part during the interview between the police and the witnesses. I personally find it highly entertaining. Reading this book feels like a pat on the back in reassurance and an embrace.Overall, this author is a genius and his book the height of comedy fiction.

And btw, I cried reading thisIt’s 12 hours later (after finishing this book), and SPOILER ALERT, I’m UNWELL. Before the review itself, let me tell you something. About 4-5 years ago, I started reading “A Man Called Ove”, which is probably the most famous book from this author. I read about a hundred pages and never finished the book. Why, you may ask. It made me SAD, and not in a cute way (I like sad books but that was TRAUMATIZING. And the sadness started on page 1, like, what happened to HELLO??? HI??? HOW ARE YOU DOING???And then I read this one…And I was TRICKED. Cuz it was equally as sad, just packed in a humorous package. And I ate it up, and now I’m left empty. OOPSPLOT This book follows the events of one bizarre heist and the EVEN MORE BIZARRE aftermath, a hostage crisis. During an apartment viewing, a masked man barges in and takes all people present hostage. Through a series of weird events, the situation is resolved, but once policemen release the people and get in the apartment, the masked man is nowhere to be found. Where did he go and why is there blood on the floor?THOUGHTS I wouldn’t say this book belongs to a specific genre. It’s closest to a mystery, and trust me, PLOT TWISTS came out of nowhere, and there were so many of them. Every single page you turn you cry for help! (that’s how I like my books) We don’t really have a main character, the story follows the lives of about 10 people who are, totally “accidentally”, involved in this bizarre heist. Yeah, you guessed it, they’re all connected, but how, I’m not gonna tell you, you have to read it to find out (I’m doing you a favor, this book DESERVES TO BE READ). As I said, this book was BEYOND FUNNY (I love my gemini authors), but it was “laughing through the pain” ngl. I love how Backman cooked all these hard life topics and served them as an ice coffee that you can take on the go. So, it was very humorous, but don’t think about the meaning of the jokes, CUZ YOU WILL END UP CRYING. The writing style is so simple yet so unique and personal, unmistakably Frederik Backman. The book was indeed a bit long and the story did kind of drag, but it was still VERY WORTH IT. Also, I want to point out how this book is “job-interview-my-hobby-is-reading-this-is-my-favorite-book”material. I do say this EVERY TIME I end up liking a book, BUT PLEASE READ THIS ONE. It made me think about so many important aspects of life while also giving me the jokes, and LESSONS, and a good cry (the ending was so sad). It’s a piece of literature I’ll proudly put on my shelf (I’m so glad I have a physical copy) and force all my friends to read it! CATCH ME talking about it ALL THE TIME!STRAIGHT TO THE ALL-TIME-FAVORITES SHELF!TW: This book deals with the topics of depression and suicide. Your mental health should be your first priority, so if you’re easily triggered, don’t mind my raving and skip this one! Happy reading!💕🏩"

I was so wound up, I had to grab my pogo stick and hop! There’s nothing like a book that grabs your whole being and then shakes you silly. Okay. Trying to calm down. First, anxiety is my middle name, so how could I NOT read a book called Anxious People? Heading to the book, I was all good-anxious. But I was also bad-anxious because of my horrible run-in with Backman’s A Man Called Ove. (I fretted; would I be able to like ANYTHING by this writer?) Gawd did I hate that book. Gawd did I love this book! Ove was about a curmudgeon who sent me screaming like a pissed-off maniac. This book is about a bank robber who I wanted to sit and drink tea with. The bad anxiety flew right out the window as I dug in.This book made me hop, alrighty. It’s got such a bizarre, juicy plot that kept flipping and twisting, all inside-out. Naysayers call it over the top, I call it hilarious and genius. And the plot is intricate as hell. At no time could I figure out where the story was going—I completely LOVE it when that happens, it’s such edge-of-my-seat fun. As a bonus, there’s a wild mystery that kept me guessing (where oh where did the bank robber go?), and the solve was so damn creative. The book was intricately constructed—a masterpiece, in fact. With each new turn, I nodded in awe to the writer. I saw him at his desk, I imagined his imagination.Okay, the plot is bizarre and luscious, but so are the characters. You have a bank robber, a bunch of hostages, a real estate agent, a couple of cops, and a psychologist. All quirky, of course, and all interesting as hell (which is a feat because they are all just ordinary people). Some of them are invited to my tea party, but there’s one meanie you can keep. Well, even she ended up with some redeeming qualities. Actually, I think that’s where Backman’s genius lies: He makes you sympathize with every single character by the end. He has tremendous insight into the human condition, into what makes people tick. The story is about how all of these players interact and grow close. Relationships are rich. And Backman is really good at making his characters seem real. He takes a regular, flawed person; grabs a magnifying glass; and voila. Then he puts them all in a pot and watches as each one enhances the flavors of the others. You end up with a fantastic cast of characters.I also loved the language; it’s stylin’. And there’s a lot of humor, and there’s wisdom. I highlighted a lot. Here are some samples: “The four biggest little words one person, anyone at all, can say to another: It wasn’t your fault.”“You need psychology if you think you’re a dolphin. You need psychiatry if you’ve killed all the dolphins.”“You can always tell by the way people who love each other argue: the longer they’ve been together, the fewer words they need to start a fight.”“The bank robber blinked so many times that it looked like Morse code.”“Beads of sweat bounced from hair to hair on his bare back, like a singularly unappealing pinball game.”“You’re like a self-help book, only in reverse.”“Estelle knew no better way of saying that she cared about people than to ask if they were hungry.”One nit (and it just won’t go out of my head even though I am telling it to): Almost all of the hostages give the cops a lot of guff during their interviews, and they don’t let up. It’s sometimes witty but mostly it’s just annoying—enough already. First, who wants to listen to people argue? And second, it’s totally unrealistic to have every single hostage give lip. I’ve decided that authors find it easier to write conflict than to write harmony. Whatever the reason, I think it’s overkill here.I could return to gushing but I’ll spare you. All I will say is, if you want an absorbing, funny, poignant read, check this book out! It tickled me pink."

I bought this book the second it was published in November of 2020! I raced to the bookshop and felt a thrill when I held it in my hands! Then, naturally, I proceeded to not read it for more than a year! I knew I’d love it, because I love absolutely everything Fredrik Backman writes! The only other book of his I haven’t read yet is Brit Marie Was Here, mainly because I don’t want to not have an unread Backman book on my shelves! Luckily he’s still writing and I get to look forward to new releases, but I still didn’t want to pick the book up and finish it! Well, clearly I finally did! And I still have Brit Marie waiting for me on my shelf, so I don’t feel entirely at a loss for unread Backman books! So, Anxious People, where do I even begin! What I love about this story and his writing, besides absolutely everything, is his humor! This book deals with quite heavy and important topics, but every page is full of laughter and the silliness of our “idiot” human minds!He kept explaining what this book was about, and I loved that! It’s about: a bank robbery, a hostage drama, an apartment viewing, a bridge, but most certainly, it’s about idiots! All it takes is one really idiotic idea! What Backman does so brilliantly, is show that we’re all idiots in our own way! This books is in fact about all those things I just mentioned, but mainly, it’s about how everyone is just trying to live their life the best they can! Sometimes life makes us do really idiotic things, especially when it comes to the people we love! I couldn’t put this book down! The past few days, while reading this story, life left like a series obstacle keeping me from reading it, and that’s one of the best feelings! This book is also about caring for people you barely know. What I find even more beautiful, is how as readers we not only care for people we barely know, but for people who don’t even exist! These people were made up by one person, who we also barely know, but through a collection of words, it feels like we’ve known them all our lives! Life does make us do really idiotic things, especially when it comes to reading! (I will continue to not read Brit Marie, because I don’t want to not have an unread Backman book on my shelves! Yes, that’s absolutely idiotic!) Please please please read this book, as well as all of his other books! Thank you Fredrik Backman! Sincerely,An idiot :)"

In this book, a lot of the characters act pretty funny (after all it is announced as a story of idiots) but bare their soul.There is an incident around 10 years back where a man jumped off a bridge to take his life. There are people who saw and some who didn’t but the thinking and future of many were impacted. The link to this incident, with the characters and incidents of today is absolutely brilliant.There is this person who decides to rob a bank but chooses one which is cashless, and next runs off to a nearby building where a group of people are viewing an apartment for potential purchase. The bungling bank robber now has a set of hostages who are difficult to control. Each of those at the viewing have a story and many experiences. This is a small town and a father-son duo are the two cops who arrive at the scene. A more experienced negotiator has also been summoned from Stockholm. There are events to handle and puzzles to unravel.The strength of Backman’s stories is always in the musings which accompany the characters behaviours and here again the messages laced with humour are outstanding – our modern lifestyles, priorities, struggles, relationships, mental well-being and above all purpose. The mental well-being aspects when covered indirectly was great, but the direct ones via the therapy sessions felt pretty lame to me including some distracting and largely meaningless prattle around veganism. A lot of the good things about the book were said in the first half itself and it felt like the plot was being dragged later. The tempo does recover at the end, with some excellent summarization & commentary. My rating: 4.25 / 5.A thought-provoking read in the usual Backman style you cannot miss."
87,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18643650-mark-porton,Rating 4 out of 5,"Anxious People by Fredrik Backman was a breath of fresh air, it was funny, interesting, meaningful and wonderfully paced. I really enjoyed this book about a Bank Robber who isn’t really that good at bank robbing and ends up taking a group of strangers hostage. To say anymore would be to commit a gross act of spoilage.The humour, as all good funny stuff should be, came when unexpected and was genuinely funny, not laugh out loud funny, but amusing. Chuckle-worthy.The author makes the point we, us punters, are a bunch of ‘idiots’ making our way through this world. We are all negotiating our dramas (big and small) and mostly seem to make it to the end of the day. This is our common thread – the thing that binds us. We walk past each other in the shopping mall, sit next to each other at the traffic lights and are blissfully unaware of the similar difficulties our fellow humans are experiencing. I must say though, whenever I fly into a city, I always look at the rooves of the houses I fly over and reflect on what may be happening in each of those little boxes – good and bad. Sometimes, we need an event to throw us into the company of strangers, to learn about the lives of others. This story really makes one realise how we all seem to just keep going (mostly) no matter what is thrown at us, or when it’s thrown at us and in whatever quantity. It really is quite sobering. The author covers all of this with a wonderful splash of funny stuff.A really enjoyable read.Also – it’s Christmas Day here in Australia at this moment. I’d like to wish you all a Merry Christmas – this GR community is a wonderful thing and I feel really privileged to have become acquainted with quite a few of you. Much love to you and yours 😊4 Stars"

Me encantó todo. Desde la trama tan intrigante y compleja, hasta la simpleza, sátira y comedia de los personajes que la conforman. Se me fue como agua y pude disfrutar como se iban enlazando las distintas narrativas.Jamás creí que el robo de un banco pudiera llevarme a un recorrido emocional tan amplío y tan profundo. Y es que este libro a primera vista podrá parecer un simple libro de suspenso, pero va mucho más allá.Terminé encariñándome con cada personaje y su historia, que al abordarse a un nivel individual se saborea con cada palabra. Además de que tiene una infinidad de mensajes (y frases que amé) sobre la salud mental. Este, siendo el pilar de toda la novela.Al final me sentí triste de despedirme de los personajes, pero quedé muy satisfecho con la resolución de la trama.NECESITO QUE TODOS LEAN ESTE LIBRO."

Now I am starting a quest to read all his books. ❤️ When it started by saying “this is a book about idiots“ I thought it was going to be my life story! LolThe initial ‘rabbit’ scene had me in stitches! I was crying in the best way possible and got in a full abdominal workout – literally. LMAO.This is a story where everyone is connected, after all it’s a small world. It turns out this book is less about idiots and more about forgiveness: forgiving others and forgiving yourself. It’s about a community of people held together by a common thread. A community that will save one person in order to save themselves.This is a book that makes you wish six stars were an option! An easy read written by a true storyteller that will leave you emotionally for an ambitious to start tomorrow. "

In this unlikely group, each person has underlying frustrations — While they don’t always show it well, at the end of the day, most of them just want the same things for those they love. Anxious People is slow moving, with background on each character revealed over time. Some things I predicted, others I did not. Compassion and humanity are the main themes here. It took me a little while to get into the style of the writing, but in true Backman form, it did not disappoint. Beartown is still my favorite but I really liked Anxious People too."

The people here came across to me as self absorbed snobs who decides to get together to save this life who they thought in so many was like them. Something they thought could make their sorry life a little more bearable? Or perhaps cure them of this void or depression that they're feeling... And I just couldn't connect to these disjointed stories and their broken heroes/heroines.I really liked the previous books by this author but this one had just so much discord among the characters and that feeling of superiority that when they came together, it was not very cohesive and smooth. Hope his next book will be a hit with me."

I love Backman's books & have read all of them so I love his writing but this book didn't live up for me.  The first 100 pages are rough to get through and by the end you do love every character but it just feels disjointed at times...and confusing. Backman has an amazing way of writing seriously but with a funny undertone and he delivers here but a little to much on the funny. Overall I gave it a 3, I didn't really love it. "

If you loved his other works you'll love this, too, if not then it'll probably won't work for you as well. Backman does what he does best: writing about humanity and its struggles. The bad and ugly sides but also the hope and solidarity. The story on its own is ridiculous - but it speaks to your heart and everyone can relate to it.An incredibly real, poignant and heartwarming but also very sad story. Highly recommended!"

96,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8905971-corina,Rating 4 out of 5,"I feel Fredrik Backman is a rare kind of storyteller.And Anxious People is a special kind of story.It’s story about many things. A bank robbery. Stupid decisions. All the things humans do for love. Our empathy. Our need for connection. And our ingrained ability to come together and help others in need.As it happens, I actually read the book twice already. Book and audiobook. And I feel, only by reading it the second time did I really appreciate the complexity of it all.The author connects the lives of so many different characters in Anxious People. Delivers so many interesting backstories. The back and forth, the jumping from one character to another, it all makes sense in the end. And that, is the strangest part of all.How much sense it all makes.Days later, I’m still thinking about this book. About the way it was written. And most of all the originality of it all.And although I didn’t LOVE the novel immediately. But the more I thought about it the more I adored it. Because, the book is something truly special. Different and thoughtful in an unexpected way.Honestly, I wasn’t sure about the book when I started it. But now, after I had some time to think about it, I get it. In a very interesting way the author captured the human spirit in its rawest form. Our flaws. And the many stupid decisions we make. And how it often comes full circle.It’s a powerful book in a quirky and understated way.With a cast that is as endearing as it is relatable.In the end, Anxious People is a story that really showcases what story telling is all about. Moreover, it also confirms what kind of storyteller Fredrick Backman is. Because he is the BEST KIND there is!!!___________________________________I received a copy of this book from the publisher for free in exchange for an honest review.

Fredric Backman masterfully creates authentic characters and uses them to paint remarkable stories. In simplest terms this is the story of a bank robbery gone wrong. An apartment viewing that becomes a hostage situation. BUT it is SO more than that it is about eight strangers who become lifelong friends. It’s about humanity, human connection, and empathy. It’s a tale of bumbling idiots that made me think Life is messy and sometimes we are all bumbling idiots. The story hit me in the feels and had me laughing out loud in the middle of the night. Marin Ireland narrates the audiobook and does a stellar job. She gave each of these colorful characters the perfect voice. I seriously felt as though I was right there in this apartment with these wonderful quirky characters. A quirky story with a ton of heart.This book in emojis 🌁 🔫 🐰 🍕 🍷 📖 🗝 🎆 *** Big thank you to Atria and LibroFM for my gifted copy of this book. All opinions are my own. ***"

Mas logo que me deparei com a sinopse do romance do autor sueco, que se tornou um best seller em vários países, fiquei um pouco na dúvida sobre de que maneira o título do livro poderia se relacionar com a história.De forma bem resumida, Backman nos apresenta uma situação peculiar: um grupo de pessoas diferentes uma das outras é feito refém por um assaltante de banco estreante e bem atrapalhado. E é a partir do final dessa confusão que o autor vai nos revelando aos poucos como tudo começou e o que levou cada uma das pessoas a visitar aquele apartamento na véspera do ano novo.Assim, o que parece ser apenas uma história engraçada sobre um roubo mal-sucedido e planejado, acaba se revelando uma incursão nos conflitos internos de cada um dos personagens. São traumas, angústias, arrependimentos, vontades e crises de relacionamento que, quando misturados, podem caber dentro desse guarda-chuva que o título parece nos indicar: somos todos gente ansiosa. Todos com nossas próprias questões, que costumam ficar bem escondidas quando nos apresentamos em um contexto social - como uma visita a um apartamento, por exemplo.E toda a situação envolvendo os reféns parece estar relacionada, de alguma forma, com a história de um suicídio ocorrido em uma ponte da cidade há vários anos. A tragédia afetou, de forma única, muitos dos personagens dessa obra, inclusive os policiais - pai e filho - responsáveis por investigar o assalto ao banco. Nesse ponto, confesso que a parte dos interrogatórios me pareceu um pouco cansativa, atrapalhando o bom ritmo da história.Também vale dizer que você não vai encontrar aqui um grande desenvolvimento sobre as questões psicológicas dos personagens. É muito mais um encontro com diferentes pessoas e seus próprios conflitos. A leitura desperta reflexões, ao mesmo tempo que nos emociona, nos faz rir e questionar sobre o que está além da máscara que cada um carrega no seu dia a dia.

That’s how Fredrik Backman’s writing style always affects me and that’s what keeps bringing me back! Be prepared for all the feels with this book!I have read all of what Backman has published so far, so there was no question in my mind that I was going to read this book too. After knowing that, I think what intrigued me the most was the title of the book!! I can relate to anxious people as I’m sure many of us can, especially this year.The story is a bit crazy. It’s about a failed bank robbery that turns into an apartment hostage situation!! Sound a little over the top? It is, in the best possible way. There are many different anxious characters in this book to get to know. I usually wouldn’t like so many characters in one story, but Backman has a way of writing true-to-life characters that makes it easy for the reader to follow and relate to. By the end of the book, you will be rooting for all of them!! I love how a bunch of very different people were thrown into a bad situation and the way they coped with it was to get to know and understand each other’s anxieties, in turn becoming friends. Because it’s a story about friendships, we all see a little bit of ourselves in the characters. If you are a big fan of quotes, you will have plenty to bullet journal with this one!!One of my favorite quotes in the book was “The ones that make you laugh last a lifetime.” It’s referring to people and it really spoke to me. After all, laughter is the best medicine and if we have that in our lives, our lives are full. There are quotes of life lessons scattered throughout the book making it even more special.For Backman fans, this is a no-brainer, read it!! If you are new to Backman, be prepared to read a book like none other you have ever read before. It will be one that sticks with you for a lifetime! It has made my top 10 for 2020 list! You’ll either love it or hate it!!

The current climate doesn’t do anything for my literature reading mojo, still, I pushed myself to read this. I loved the plot and the concept of this book and how Backman brought everyone’s stories together.Yet again, Backman’s understanding of human nature shines through. Everybody has a story, everybody hurts and most people have anxieties, ranging from daily life anxieties to the more serious kind. There’s suicide, suicide attempts, grief, trauma, loneliness, relationship breakdown, and self-loathing. All these serious aspects are well balanced out by humour, be it observational or situational. As I read on, my enjoyment and appreciation of this novel grew exponentially. I don’t know what it is about Backman’s books, they just make me soft. For whatever reason, I never resent him for doing that to me. Backman’s books are always killing me softly.So, get anxious people, in the exciting kind of way, this upcoming novel is another fantastic read from Fredrik Backman. Many thanks to Atria Books, Simon and Schuster for the advanced reading copy of Anxious People. "

Shortest Summary Ever: There’s a bank robber and a hostage situation. 2 cops - a father and son trying to end the stand off. A therapist. But the hostage situation is not what the book is truly about - it’s about people. Fallible, honest and dishonest, funny and sad, loved and unloved - people, even the idiots.Thoughts: This is my first Backman novel and I’m impressed with his witticisms and dead-on characterizations. This book was the 2020 away from it all that I have been craving. A bumbled bank robbery turns into the strangest hostage situation ever - a cast of characters one could only throw together from a pot luck table. (PS this would make a cool play!) The characters are likable, laughable, terrible and altogether - valuable because they are PEOPLE. That’s what made this novel - a look at people we would despise and some who just make us laugh or cry - emotion, feeling... but not in a touchy-feely wind-beneath-my-wings way. More of a “hey I know that dude. What a jerk!” Real people. Who sometimes surprise you in real ways.You know THAT guy and you know HER but do you know WHY they are the PEOPLE they are?Enjoy the journey.All my reviews available at scrappymags.com around time of publication.Genre: contemporary fictionRecommend to: Those looking for different, quirky, a little weird.Not recommended to: Mainstream bookers or those seeking belly laughs... it’s not quite hilarious.Thank you to the author, NetGalley and Atria Books for my advanced copy in exchange for my always-honest review and for making me happy I have no home-hunting to do right now."

Words that every one of us needs to hear at some time in our life. Because we are all idiots, as this novel tells us time and time again. ""We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we're more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices too, all of our tomorrows"". "" People want to be good. Deep down. Kind. The problem of course is that it isn't possible to be kind to idiots, because they're idiots"". It's pretty ironic that I finished this book on a day when I had more than my fair share of idiots to cross my path. And I ranted and raved about how people could be so stupid. I vowed to stay away from any contact with unnecessary people and just stay in my bubble. I mean, really, what are people thinking? But....how many of those people went home talking about me?Two more quotes, because this author is also very funny. ""It's hardly surprising that people get confused and society is going to the dogs when it's full of caffeine-free coffee, gluten-free bread, and alcohol-free beer"". "" She had never had time for an affair, how on earth does anyone find the time? All that stress, Anna-Lena thought, and a whole new man to deal with"". This is the story of a bank robbery and hostage situation that goes wrong, but where a whole lot of things go right as well. Because we are all idiots.And please Lord, let me have the same kind of affair that Estelle had."

But, as the story hit about the 1/4 mark the characters began to separate into their own voices. Backman has a real talent in his ability to break through and touch on feelings/emotions every reader can relate to in some way. I don’t know how he was able to make such an intricate story move so flawlessly. There were so many moments in this that had me laughing and the next wanting to cry. This is also chocked full of amazing quotes... I have a whole ‘note’ on my iPad filled and I will be referring to them often. Another favorite of 2020."

Finalista entre las mejores novelas de ficción de Goodreads del 2020, esta quedó en segundo lugar. Conociendo mi mala relación (en general) con los premios literarios, debería haberme servido de advertencia.Me gustó sobre todo el comienzo, pues la introducción es muy buena, y te anticipa una novela cargada de aventuras. El final también lo salvo. Nada que objetar a cómo el autor finaliza su obra, pero, toda la parte central se me hizo reiterativa, y, a veces, muy simplona. No sé, ha sido como releer a Tom Sharpe (la serie de novelas de Wilt), pero con menos ingenio y mala leche. Ya sé que la novela es un canto a la esperanza, y a fe mía que el autor canta bien, pero le sobran dulce y aditivos, convirtiendo el resultado en un pastelito empachoso, que, francamente, en más de un capítulo se me indigestó. Resumiendo, que peca de “bobalicona”. Si el propósito era conmover a la par que suscitar alguna que otra sonrisa, conmigo pasó bastante de largo, y ya es pena. Tiene frases muy buenas, eso sí. Pero los personajes son estereotipos llevados hasta la extenuación (el hombre disfrazado de conejo, por ejemplo). Y los diálogos podrían haber sido menos ridículos. Para hablar de la depresión y del suicidio, que son temas muy serios y candentes, no hacía falta recurrir a tal vodevil, por mucho que F.B. lo haga intentando quitar hierro al asunto. Es un buen intento, con una muy justita resolución. Pero tiene su mérito, y no seré yo el que se lo deniegue. Quizás se trata de que su forma de escribir no me dice gran cosa. Tengo pendiente otra novela de este autor, “Un hombre llamado Ove”, que también tiene muy buenas reseñas. Me tomaré un tiempo y lo intentaré de nuevo. Y, si tampoco, es que este autor no es para mí. Y cada mochuelo a su olivo."

The holiday break made it take longer, giving me a lot longer to sit with and ponder this latest and greatest addition to Fredrik Backman novels' spectacular collection. With each new book that Backman releases, he climbs higher on my top ten favorite authors of the all-time list. Fredrick Backman is a literary genius that grasps the human condition in a way that causes his words to gut my soul. He breaks my heart and then mends it anew. I always come away from his books with a more open mind, heart, and soul. He sometimes helps cleanse challenging emotional issues I don't even realize I have been harboring and slowly sickening myself. Anxiety has been something that I have battled with a lot in the past year. This book is timely in the heightened state of anxiety that many worldwide have been battling, some of whom have never had to deal with this issue. The pandemic has made many feel further and further from human interaction and understanding than ever before. I experience the hardback and audio version of this one, with the spectacularly gifted Marin Ireland again lending her voice to speak life into Backman's characters. I don't know how best to describe a novel that needs to be read to be experienced. All I can say is that if Backman's words can touch your soul as they touch mine, you will never leave one of his novels unchanged.5 Amazing stars"

When Jim was young, children used to be punished by being sent to their rooms, but these days you have to force children to come out of them."" (PG. 29)What a story! It's like Backman and me share an anxious brain and he was comforting me throughout letting me know ""Everything will be okay. Being a parent is hard."" It was quirky, funny, sad, and so quotable! I kept giggling and making my husband listen to certain lines in the story. I'd stare at him until he put down the phone or muted the T.V. I liked the characters because they felt like real people. You think they are horrible people but once the onion was peeled you realized they had human fears and the things that happened to them throughout their lives made them into the people we are reading about now. I wish that in real life we could give each other this chance but most people just smile and move on, including me. Life is too busy to invest in anyone.""We don't take our eyes off them for days at a time, but then you read just ONE text message and it's as if all your best moments never happened.

I think I'm going to need at least a couple of weeks (or, uh, MONTHS) to really unpack everything that was in this novel.Fredrik Backman is a master at unraveling the human condition. If that wasn't already impressive enough, his prose and dark humor are so original that you really can't help but compulsively read what he's written, and the fact that all of the larger meta questions he's putting front and center are wrapped up in a classic bank-robbery-gone-wrong mystery is all the better.Often if I like books I'll just wax poetic about them for a good, long while, but I don't think anything I say can really do this one justice. It's beautiful, it's tragic, it's heartwarming, it's depressing, it's funny, and it's serious. My only content warning is that it deals with suicide, mental illness, and death, so be prepared.The bottom line: I feel lucky to have read this novel. And isn't that the highest praise you can give a book?"

I can’t remember the last time I connected with a story like I connected with this one. The story was beautiful, with unexpected strings that connect characters and plot lines in ways that blew my mind as I was reading. The story’s narration jumps around the timeline, leading you to believe that you understand the story fairly early on, but trust me, you don’t know the half of it.

I had hope for the bank robber/hostage theme but found it to be convoluted and boring. I realize that the story needed to unspool then respool so we could look at the events from different angles. The problem was I found the assortment of hostages shallow and unnecessarily argumentative.. Some of the events and characters (especially the rabbit) were beyond ridiculous. The many attempts at humor did not work for me. Every once in awhile a cliched homily was thrown in to make an attempt to give some disjointed meaning to this wretched book. I’ve always thought I’ve had a pretty decent sense of humor but maybe I need to check myself. First Sedaris and now Backman are on my crappy book list.

I honestly thought he wasn’t for me and I’m so pleased to have been proven wrong. I loved this quirky book! It was heart-wrenching, funny, outlandish at times and just so darn relatable. ⁣⁣⁣⁣This book pulled at my heartstrings. At first glance, it’s a story about a would-be bank robber and an apartment full of hostages but really it’s about so much more. It’s about being human with all the messy, ridiculous mistakes we make along the way. It’s about love and forgiveness. It’s about allowing ourselves to grieve and move on. It’s about acceptance, friendship, despair and hope. ⁣⁣⁣⁣I don’t know how Backman tackles such big themes (suicide, infidelity, mental health and more) with such wit and grace but does he ever. I had the opportunity to listen to the audio courtesy of @librofm and it was so well done.

All opinions are my own.I don't mind being the dark horse on this one. I know that Fredrick Backman is an insanely well loved author, and while I absolutely loved A Man Called Ove, I haven't liked a single other book by this author, including Anxious People. I gave this one a try because it sounded really different for him, but it didn't work for me.First of all, there are a lot of characters in this novel, and each of them have a very sad life story. There was literally nothing positive in any of their lives. You get lots of little glimpses into the backstory of each character but nothing too deep. Just enough to let you know how miserable they are. Every few chapters, there is a transcript from the police interview of a different character, trying to address a crime, yet each interview was rambling and each character avoided answering any of the questions so that what actually happened never really comes to light and no one seems worried or upset in any way by being held hostage at gun point. It just felt like reading nonsense. The writing itself is too silly, too jaunty, to full of whimsy and didn't match the depressing nature of each character's life. It felt like it was inappropriately making light of the character's struggle, like telling a joke ""too soon"" after an accident and it just isn't funny. And the third-person point of view made the whole thing unenjoyable to read, in my opinion. I don't usually write reviews this negative but a ridiculously large amount of people rave about this author that I am not worried my review will hurt this book in any way, rather I am hoping to reach a few outliers like myself who just don't see the appeal in this writer who has always come across as trying too hard in my opinion."

I realize I am one of the very few dissenters in the ranks, but the book says it all . . . 
“Worst hostages ever. You’re the worst hostages ever.”
So the whole premise here is about a failed bank robbery and how said bank robber ends up with the worst hostages ever and it all takes place after the hostage crisis has been averted and the would-be robber has become MIA and it’s all six degrees of separation and somehow also is about a super serious subject like suicide and it all gets delivered in a quirky little package full of obtuse police interviews and absurdities like giant rabbits and piles of blood that need to be accounted for and things that are supposed to make you feel all of the feelz that gets tied up with a pretty little bow of “awwwwwwww” at the end and OH. MY. GOD. IT. WAS. EXHAUSTING.I loved Ove. And I mean looooooooooooooooooooooooved. Almost unhealthily. Like there’s a 12% chance it might come to fisticuffs after I tell you to “cash me outside - how 'bout dah” if you tell me you hated it and I’m having a bad day. But after failing at yet another Backman new release that I was highly anticipating I need to admit he is just not for me. There’s nothing wrong with being a one-hit wonder.

I have a love/hate relationship with Backman. So, I’ll start about what I didn’t like about this book.This is a book where you never forget it’s a story. Backman reminds you consistently throughout the book. You’ll never get a chance to lose yourself in the plot, because most of the plot is almost hidden behind mounds of narration. And this isn’t descriptions of events, or action, or even settings or character attributes. This is heaps of character motivation, observations, and reflections. My favorite books are where the characters come alive through their actions and dialog – those books become page turners that I can’t put down. They become movies in my head. However, in the first third, this book was a chore. In fact, it never came alive for me. Backman tells you the story, tells you what the characters are thinking, and tells you the ending. For being 350 pages, little happens in this book. Dialog and action are minimal, dotted throughout the narration. So, sounds like a recipe for a one- or two-star book – right? Not so fast . . . In my opinion, you could call this book self-indulgent. I felt like Backman was working through some things and the ‘Author Thanks’ section appears to confirm that. But here’s the plot twist. It still all kind of works. We get way deep into Backman’s psyche. And it feels honest. And Backman’s smart, witty, funny, and clever observer of human nature. I think part of the reason we (or I?) enjoy novels is that it’s a rare chance to climb inside someone else’s head and see how they think. We know our real-life conversations are carefully guarded. But an honest author, revealing their thoughts, views, ideas for over 300 pages? That’s a rare glimpse into a fellow human’s mind. So, while the story never came alive, I couldn’t help but enjoy the continuously onslaught of heartfelt and witty observations, viewpoints, and perspectives. There is also the mystery of what happened to the bank robber, but that’s secondary to Backman’s insights. Some will love this book, I didn’t love it, but I did appreciate and enjoy it.A slow-burn story, filled with quirky characters, that’s more about compassion and truth, than plot and storyline."

'This is a story about about a bridge, and idiots, and a hostage drama and an apartment viewing. But it's also a love story. Several, in fact.'
Mr Backman has done it again! He's written a book that is seemingly about a ridiculous situation with a bunch of difficult people but he's made us laugh and made us cry and love those people with their anxieties and human flaws.The bulk of the novel takes part at an apartment viewing where two couples, a single woman, an elderly woman, a rabbit and a real estate agent accidently become hostages when a failed bank robber runs in looking for an escape route. Initially the hostages are difficult to like. The couples are anxious about being able to buy the apartment and niggling at each other, one of the single women is a lonely bank manager who doesn't like people, the real estate agent is nervous about not being very good at her job and the elderly woman has her own anxieties. The rabbit isn't having a good day either. They don't act like good hostages either, ignoring the bank robber despite having a gun waved at them. But somehow, in his inimitable way, Mr Backman has us caring about these people and their relationships and anxieties. He is able to drill deep below the surface of each of them to expose their humanity and show us what makes each of them so special and he's able to do it while having us laughing one minute at the quirky humor of it all and next with tears in our eyes over something poignant and touching.The police aren't having a good day either. Father and son, Jim the old hand and Jack preferring modern methods, make up most of the small police force in their small town. They're not used to bank robbers or handling hostage situations, but they can't wait for detectives to come from Stockholm. Their interviews with the hostages after they are released, interspersed through the narrative, are hilarious. There was so much to love about this novel and remember afterwords - the connection with bridge, the pizza, the closet, the fireworks and the ending which was just perfect. I hope Mr Backman goes on to write many more beautiful books like this. "

From one second, I’m laughing my head off and next, I’m thinking way too deeply about life and the lives of people around me. The interviews were so funny, and I was wondering what the heck was wrong with these people. I’m glad it made sense at the end though. All the characters were so interesting. NO, seriously, all the characters were freaking unique. I swear I’m so used to reading so many boring, flat characters and, then once in a while, I'm blessed with this book. I just want to be as bold as these characters are when someone is holding a gun nearby. I also love how the twists kept coming. They weren’t super shocking, but they still gave me the feeling of “Oh, I did not see that coming!” Are all Backman’s books this good? If yes, this bitch is about to go on a Backman book marathon. I also really loved the ending. It was all about people understanding each other, which is such a great lesson.Great job Backman!"

I know reviews are super high for this one but I honestly think I’d rather get a root canal than have to reread this one. I only finished so I could rate it.

128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2922102-blaine,Rating 5 out of 5,"A bank robbery. A hostage drama. A stairwell full of police officers on their way to storm an apartment. It was easy to get to this point, much easier than you might think. All it took was one single really bad idea.This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiots. So it needs saying from the outset that it's always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is. Especially if you have other people you're trying to be a reasonably good human being for.…This is a story about a bridge, and idiots, and a hostage drama, and an apartment viewing. But it’s also a love story. Several, in fact.The basic plot of Anxious People is pretty simple to describe, and told in the book’s first chapter. After a bank robbery gone wrong, the robber flees and takes shelter—and therefore hostages—at a nearby apartment viewing. After several hours, the robber sets the hostages free, but when the police enter the apartment, the robber has vanished. The rest of the book tells the much more complicated story of how everyone came to be in the apartment, what happened during the hostage crisis, and what happened to each of them afterwards.Anxious People is told in in a similar fashion as the brilliant movie The Usual Suspects. The police are interviewing the various witnesses immediately after their release, trying to understand what happened, with most of the story being flashbacks from the witnesses’ different perspectives. And to keep the movie references going, at times I kept thinking of the underrated Denis Leary movie The Ref, in which he takes shelter at a Christmas party with the world’s worst family and begins mediating all of their family drama. But this is a Fredrik Backman novel, not a noir thriller or a vehicle for insult comedy (well, except for Zara 😁), so the comparisons are limited.There are mysteries to be sure in Anxious People, primarily the fate of the robber, but this is a novel about people. How we are all shaped, and often damaged, by our experiences. Why people do what they do, and how events can quickly spiral out of control. How we are all more alike than we realize. How a little bit of compassion and understanding between individuals would probably make the world a much better place. The story has the classic Mr. Backman omniscient narrator, talking directly to “you,” the reader. And the novel is full of Mr. Backman’s observational wisdom.Anxious People is another great book by Fredrik Backman, with interesting, believable characters and an ultimately moving story. Highly recommended."

The first half, I found the characters (most of all of them) annoying and dumb and I thought, do I really want to finish this book? Then I listened to the last half. The last half was impactful, profound, and emotional in the best way. It made me laugh, smile, brought me to tears, and I fell in love with this book. I was going to give it a 3 since I disliked the first half so much, but my love for the last half made me round it up to a 4. If you're looking for a character driven novel that is heartbreaking yet heart warming, thought provoking, and all around a well written, well done story, pick this one up!

My mind is blown. I can’t even explain how my heart is both so empty and so full all at the same time. This could potentially be my favorite book of 2020. Anxious People is exactly what we need to be reading in times like these; it is the epitome of what we are all going through. We are all anxious people. I have no doubt that every single person will be able to see a piece of themselves within these characters and their stories. Deep down, we all have secrets, but to whom are you willing to tell them?“Some of us never manage to get the chaos under control, so our lives simply carry on, the world spinning through space at two million miles an hour while we bounce about on its surface like so many lost socks.”This book has many characters from an 87 year old lady to a young couple who is pregnant to an older retired husband and wife, a banker and a mystery man—all who are held hostage by a bank robber who isn’t your average criminal—left in the hands of a small town father and son cop duo. But, you’ll quickly learn that this story isn’t about them per say—but rather each of their struggles at maintaining stability in life. It’s about how well they can empathize with one other no matter how different their circumstances may be. This tale is told in dual timelines, back and forth between present day via interviews at the police station and details that unravel as the event is actually happening. “...It can be impossible to tell the difference between flying and falling.”Everyone grapples with life’s decisions; which path to take. Sometimes life continues to hit you, blow after blow and you can’t possibly take any more, so you end up on a bridge, ready to end it all, or perhaps watching someone on that bridge wondering if your life is as bad as theirs. Occasionally, you may even be the bridge, holding another person up. “...Sometimes it’s easier to live with your own anxieties if you know that no one else is happy either.”Fredrik Bachman books are ALWAYS 5- star reads for me and he’s an auto-buy author despite what the book is even about. He hits you in ALL of the feels. He outdid himself with “A Man Called Ove”, but somehow I enjoyed “Britt-Marie Was Here” EVEN more! But this— THIS takes the cake ! Breathtakingly beautiful!I read this with 25 other ladies and we were ALL beyond impressed! 5 ⭐️ and beyond!"

M-a dus cu gândul la o comedie ieftină, apreciată de cei care râd când le arăți degetul, și mult timp am avut ezitări, simțind că Backman a devenit comercial. Serios, puțini scriitori sunt cei pentru care aș fi ținut în casă o imagine cu un bărbat pe toaletă și o hârtie igienică.Prima parte a cărții mi-a arătat că nu m-am înșelat mult, fiind mai degrabă ,,citabilă"" decât profundă. Multe idei frumoase demne de ținut minte, dar un subiect lipsit de complexitate, care nu le permitea personajelor să evolueze. Abundența dialogurilor a contribuit la asta, pentru că personajele se tot perindau prin fața cititorului și, la final, ajungeai să le cunoști pe toate în aceeași măsură, dar pe niciunul suficient. Nimic din prima parte nu a avut forța pe care o așteptam de la cel care a scris Scandalul și Noi contra voastră.În a doua parte, însă, Backman s-a revanșat. Umor fin și inteligent, adevăruri (căci nu va exista niciodată un singur adevăr, ci fiecare îl va avea pe al lui) realiste despre viață, sinceritate, nenumărate prilejuri de introspecție, emoții variate și același mod aproape inegalabil de a conecta personajele și a le construi atât de bine, încât e imposibil să nu găsești părți din tine măcar în câteva.Zara a fost de departe preferata mea. Nici nu vreau să o descriu pentru că sigur s-ar enerva pe mine, că vorbesc despre ea pe la spate. Tare, tare mult m-am apropiat de ea! Am așezat-o în topul meu, după Benji din Björnstad. Nu e cea mai bună carte a lui Backman, dar e a lui, iar dragostea nu ar fi dragoste, dacă nu ar rămâne aceeași și ,,în ciuda a"". Incredibil cât de multe lucruri poate ascunde o mască respingătoare și câte dureri ascunse putem purta în noi! Nu sunt suficienți cei uluiți că reușim să ne ridicăm dimineața din pat și nu mergem pe stradă cu bucăți atârnânde din noi, pe care ni le-am smuls singuri, sperând că măcar atunci va vedea cineva lucrurile care ne dor atât de tare, încât nici nu putem vorbi despre ele.

To słodko-gorzka (choć bardziej gorzka) opowieść o życiu i jego odcieniach. Autor w fantastyczny sposób bawi się formą, bo choć trzyma się konwencji komediowej, to poznając historię bohaterów wcale nie jest nam do śmiechu. Nie brakuje tutaj absurdalnych sytuacji, które doskonale odzwierciedlają absurdy naszego życia. To książka do bólu prawdziwa, przejmująca i dająca do myślenia. Złożona problematyka i doskonale wykreowani bohaterowie to tylko kolejny plus. Wszystko to powinno się składać w naprawdę idealną całość, ale... no właśnie. Nie mam pojęcia dlaczego, bo zdawałoby się, że w ""Niespokojnych ludziach"" jest wszystko to, czego szukam w literaturze, a jednak coś nie zagrało.

134,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30863291-philip,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5ish starsI lost my younger brother to suicide earlier this year. It’s the worst thing I’ve experienced in my life. This book isn't about suicide specifically, but it plays a key role in the narrative, along with mental illness and other issues both moral and social. It touches on some of the awful thoughts and feelings I've had, as some characters in the book wrestle with the guilt of their actions or inactions. I mention this because, as painful as those feelings are, I never once felt pain, sadness, or much negativity at all from this book until it was over. In fact it gave me joy. As much as it addresses sensitive subject matter like depression, infidelity, greed, and loneliness, it's just as much a screwball comedy of errors. A feel-good dramedy about a botched bank robbery that turns into a botched hostage situation that turns into an inspiring story about resilience, connectivity, and unexpected friendship that subverts expectations on every page. For such emotional, hard-hitting topics, it never reaches a place that hits quite hard enough or dives as deeply as the subject matter deserves. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it doesn't take depression, anxiety or suicide seriously, and definitely not that it idealizes them, but it all ends a little too tidily and sweetly without prompting the emotional catharsis I feel was missing. For that reason I can't quite bring myself to award it five stars, despite the intelligence, grace and cleverness of Backman's delivery and Neil Smith's English translation.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"

I give this book 4.5 stars which rounds up to 5. This was my first book by Fredrik Backman and I was not disappointed. I didn’t have any expectations going in and this book ended up taking me for a ride. There were a lot of twists and turns that I did not see coming. I didn’t know that this book was a little bit of a mystery so I ended up being pleasantly surprised. The author’s insights into the human condition are so insightful. He really delves into the choices people make and what motivates them. He has a talent of saying so many poignant things in such an effortless way. I can definitely see why so many people love his books. The cast of characters were probably the best part of the book. They were idiots, but lovable idiots. I don’t have a favorite because I loved them all. They all had something about them that I found compelling. I loved how the story all came together. There are a lot of little random things that get mentioned, especially in the beginning, that you don’t quite know what to do with yet. But by the end, it all makes sense and there is that a-ha moment where everything falls into place. Overall, this book lives up to all the hype!"

The emotions that are experienced will keep building and building until you’re a quivering mess by the end.I’m a mood reader so I must be in the right mind set for one of his books. I'm pretty sure I'll be a mess by the end!Anxious People is the newest book by him. It's about a suicide on a bridge, a bank robber, and all the hostages that get pulled into that emotionally charged day.Our bank robber isn’t the most intelligent criminal. In fact, they're an idiot.When the robber tries to rob a bank one day, all of the actions after that moment have lasting consequences. Not only for the robber, but for the police officers and all the people at an open house apartment on New Year's Eve.The bank robbery goes sideways and turns into a hostage situation.This story is about idiots.And secrets.Unconditional love.Regrets and deep pain.And about finding peace with that regret and pain.Give this one a try!

137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57725883-rob,Rating 5 out of 5,"Stand alone novel by Fredrik Backman Published 2020Anxious people is exactly what it says it is, a book about anxious people.Once again Fredrik Backman brings us a story that contains some of the most, not only, anxious but obnoxious people you would ever want to meet.But for all that this is a story about the innate goodness that resides in most of us, that goodness is not always easy to see but you’ll find it if you look hard enough.A bunch of people have come together in an apartment which is up for sale. There are two married couples and the rest are singles. What they have in common is that they are all anxious and obnoxious and are strangers to each other. There is also a bank robber who is there by pure happenstance. At this moment in time they are being held hostage by the bank robber, which only making our characters even more anxious and obnoxious that usual. But, unknown to them, there is a common thread that binds these people together. That thread being a bridge. Apart from the people in the apartment there are the father and son team who arrive as the police presence.Just when you are thinking that you can’t stand another moment with these horrible, horrible people their stories start to emerge and suddenly it’s a case of what you see is not always what you get. Before long you will find yourself laughing and crying along with everyone else.What Fredrik Backman is, is a spectator of life and his gift is to put on paper what he sees in such a way that is entertaining and at the same time uplifting. No matter how bad the situation, to quote Monty Python “always look an the bright side of life”And this Fredrik Backman does with consummate ease.Can’t recommend it highly enough.5 stars "
138,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21217381-lacey,Rating 4 out of 5,"Holy fuck. That is all.Anxious People was probably the most thought-provoking humorous book I've ever read. I tried to listen surreptitiously to the audiobook while working, but at several points I couldn't stop myself from spontaneously breaking into tears or laughing out loud (and sometimes at the same time) thanks to the story, and so I probably gave myself away. Either that or I just looked like a total loon to anyone who happened to notice me crying and/or laughing on and off throughout the work day. Oh well. C'est la vie, or whatever. Sometimes it just be like that. It really do."
139,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5349403-carolyn-walsh,Rating 5 out of 5,"Fredrik Backman has done it again with this marvellous locked room mystery. He not only describes the thoughts and emotions of a diverse group of characters but skillfully conveys them to the readers, so one deeply feels their insecurities, anxieties, tragedies and peculiarities, their disappointments, loves, hopes, and regrets. He writes in a manner that gives the impression he is speaking to the individual reader. It is witty, cleverly constructed, thought-provoking, poignant, tear-jerking and wildly humorous. It begins with a desperate first- time bank robber who is having a very bad day. In the midst of a divorce, in dread of losing the custody of the children, jobless, and on the verge of eviction from their apartment, robbing a bank seemed the only solution. Later, described as the worst bank robber ever', the attempt to rob a bank fails spectacularly. The would-be robber entered a cashless bank and the police are called. Fleeing, the robber takes refuge in an apartment being shown to prospective buyers and people who just go to real estate showings out of boredom.  The mask-wearing robber is waving a gun, and ends up with eight hostages who are described as the 'worst hostages ever'. There are two married couples among the hostages. There is an older married couple who are retired, but now buy apartments to renovate and resell. A young couple consisting of a pregnant woman and her wife. Both couples are squabbling constantly. and have doubts about their relationships. A wealthy lady in her 50s attends apartment showings as a hobby to see how the working-class lives. There is a kindly woman, close to age 90, and of course, the real estate agent is now hostage as well. A man dressed only in his underwear and wearing a rabbit head mask is not out of place in this disparate group. A father and son, Jim and Jack, are the police officers assigned to the hostage case until the expert negotiator arrives from Stockholm. They seldom agree on their different approach to police work, but Jim wants his son to solve the case before help arrives from Stockholm. The expert from Stockholm is delayed which leaves the case up to Jim and Jack. The hostages are released after receiving a pizza delivery, and a gunshot is heard. On entering the apartment they find blood, but the robber/ hostage-taker is gone. Jim and Jack are concerned that he might be wounded and might die before he is apprehended, but how did he escape without being noticed?  As the policemen interview the individual hostages, they hear a lot of sarcasm and rambling comments but receive no help in finding the criminal or learning exactly what happened. They feel there is something they are not being told, or perhaps one of the hostages helped the robber escape. There are many twists and turns I never anticipated but everything falls into place by the end. The story is ultimately about love, compassion, kindness, forgiveness, redemption and being the best person one can possibly be. It is about the connectedness that inspires people to discover their best selves."
140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara,Rating 4 out of 5,"I am very happy that I chose to listen to the audio production of “Anxious People” by Fredrik Backman. Narrator Marin Ireland provided voice and ambience to the story. I might have enjoyed reading it as much as listening, but Ireland’s character voices were hilarious, along with her timing. When reading or listening to a story, I always keep the title in mind. I’m not sure why Backman chose the word “anxious” as an adjective for his people. Other adjectives come to mind after listening to the story, but I’m not going to put any ideas in anyone’s head.It’s a comedy of errors; it’s madcap fun; it’s heart-wrenching in human flaws; it’s an unwitting love story. It begins with a robbery at a cashless bank. The perpetrator is desperate. The perp needs money for rent while fighting a nasty divorce. After learning that there was no money at the bank, the perp stole away in an open apartment, disrupting an open house apartment viewing. Now the blundering bank robber becomes a hostage taker.“Worst hostages ever” is a recurring statement that the bank robber makes as the “hostages” behave less than frightened. The narrative goes back and forth from the hostage situation in the apartment, to the police station where the two deputies try to figure out what happened and where the perp escaped. At the police station, the younger deputy, who takes his job very seriously, can’t get reason out of the hostages. It is hilarious. One of the first to be interviewed is the lady bank teller who first came across the perp. Her name is London and she is one of my favorite characters (well the way Ireland voiced her is laugh-out-loud). The young police officer echo’s the perp’s feelings,(worst witnesses ever) as the officer tries to get information out of the hostages. It’s madcap. Slowly we learn what really happened when the perp had the “hostages” and how it all evolved in mayhem. The story is also about the characters in the hostage situation. In Backman fashion, he creates flawed, charming, and quirky characters; some have those crunchy exteriors that have soft hearts. Some are sweet and just want to do the right thing. Even the police, which turns out to be son and father, provide a character study in duty and familial love.I expect Backman to provide a “feel good” story, and he delivers. And Backman’s humor: he delivers as well. The dialogue banter is fantastic. I needed those 10 hours of laughter and light-heartedness.I highly recommend the audio!"
141,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda,Rating 4 out of 5,"When the bank robber realized the bank he was trying to rob was a cashless one, he felt like an idiot. He ran, trying to escape what his folly had caused and when he raced to the top of a staircase (where is he likely to escape from there?) and charged through an open door, the room was filled with people viewing the apartment with a real estate person. Suddenly they were hostages, and the bank robber was in even more trouble. As the robber/hostage taker tried to work out what to do next, the people – including an elderly couple and a pregnant lady – began talking and arguing with each other; getting to know one another.Two police officers – Jack and Jim – were in charge. Jack was the son of Jim, and while they shouldn’t have been working together (it was obvious why when reading the story) they tried. As the hostage crisis moved forward, the building surrounded by police and journalists and a negotiator on the phone – hours away and stuck in traffic, the hostages were hungry. After pizza was delivered and everyone was satisfied, the bank robber/hostage taker knew he would let the hostages go. What would be the outcome for him? Anxious People by Fredrik Backman is filled with anxious and uncertain people; of people who’ve made mistakes and people who try to amend those mistakes. There are also people who are kind and empathetic, who do their best for people whether they know them or not. I enjoyed the “actual story” which was poignant and moving - and showed us the meaning of the bridge... But, while many others have laughed out loud at this book, my sense of humour doesn’t seem to fit with Fredrik Backman books. For those who are Backman fans, go for it – you’ll love it! Recommended.With thanks to Ariele Fredman, Atria Books/Simon & Schuster via NetGalley for my digital ARC to read in exchange for an honest review."
142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35251024-nat-k,Rating 4 out of 5,"To quote a line from the book, I felt like ""...a person who's had his sense of humour amputated. Not that there's anything wrong with that.""I thought my sense of humour was still holidaying somewhere. Perhaps with my reading mojo. Thumbing their noses at me. Drinking mojitos. I was worried. I just couldn’t get into this book. My mind kept wandering away. I'd watch clouds in the sky and wonder what shapes they were making. I found the continual nitpicking of character flaws obvious and tedious. I couldn't warm to the characters or the overblown style in which they were depicted. I couldn't warm to the story. About a bank robbery gone wrong as the robber unknowingly tries to rob a cashless bank. A hostage situation ensues. The story continues. The first few chapters annoyed me. In fact, the first quarter of the book. It all seemed over the top. The heavy irony grated. Even the inter-City rivalry (Stockholm v wherever this was set) was annoying. The continual calling of people “idiots” got on my nerves. It was becoming my “wordworm” (which has happened to me with another book). It was like the word ""idiot!” jumped at me off the page, madly waving its arms to get my attention. I enjoy a good bit of sarcasm, but I was annoyed. I felt like Basil Fawlty being inconvenienced by his guests.I was even more disappointed as I adored A Man Called Ove. That book held my heart, shook it up and turned it inside out. I cried buckets. I fell completely and utterly in love with it. Which is why I couldn’t understand my lack of simpatico with this book.There’s a story about a bridge, and what happens on it. We’re told to not think about it.At this point, it was looking like 2.5⭐. If I managed to finish reading it.I persevered. I had to. This is the first Bookclub pick for the year, and our Bookclub pretty much fell by the wayside last year. So I settled in for the arvo, made a cuppa, stopped gazing at clouds, grit my teeth and kept reading. Finally at chapter 24 (yes, it did take that long), kerching! I started to enjoy it. It began to make sense. It wasn’t as annoying. I started to appreciate the heavy irony and farce, all thanks to the character of Zara. A bank manager, she was seeing a psychologist at the behest of her GP, who would no longer fill Zara’s script for sleeping pills, as it seems the issues causing the sleepless nights went deeper. In this chapter, Zara gives the therapist a good run for her money. Never mind the heavy burden and secret that was weighing her down, and her sarcastic exterior. She was only going for the sleeping pills. There’s a painting of a bridge on the therapist’s wall. The only piece of artwork. With a woman gazing out to the horizon. What is she thinking?Slowly the domino pieces started to fall. I began to get it. I connected the dots. The various character’s stories intersected and overlapped, and I realised that it was actually cleverly done. We get the background story of the “hostages” who are viewing a flat that the bank robber looks to hide in after the botched robbery. Why are they viewing the flat the day before New Year’s Eve, when the rest of the world has other, more interesting plans? Why did the bank robber only demand 6,500 kroner?Ok...now I’m at 3⭐.I’ve settled in. The overuse of irony touches a nerve here and there, but this is also the part of the book where Backman pulls out an ace, and starts the really emotional stuff that I adored in Ove. The bits that hurt you like a tiny paper cut, that shouldn’t bleed quite so much as it does.There are great lines about life, ""We lie to those we love."" and, ""...we just do our best to get through the day, because there'll be another one coming along tomorrow."" Spot on. I agree wholeheartedly. Some really deep, highly emotional stuff.And funny observations, like ""It's hardly surprising that people get confused and society is going to the dogs when it's full of caffeine-free coffee, gluten-free bread, alcohol-free beer."" had me smiling as I sipped my full strength cuppa. I started to appreciate it more and more.The flat the hostages are viewing has a direct eyeline to the bridge. The bridge that links so many of these characters lives. If only the bridge could talk, what stories it could tell.There are plenty of heavy duty themes brought to light here, all incredibly important. Suicide, substance abuse, anxiety, family relationships, co-dependency, trying to move on from the past, and doing the best you can today. Now. Making mistakes, and knowing that’s ok too. Guilt (my favourite). All wrapped up in lots of dark humour and farcical situations.”We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrow.”By the time I finished the book the next evening, I’d fallen hook, line and sinker. Yes, it's amazing. Yes, it hurts. 4⭐ emotionally wrung stars. Yes, I shed quite a few tears with this one too. It was easy to identify with the foibles and hurts of most of the characters. And if anyone is planning to read this who hasn’t already, you’ll fall in love with Estelle. Especially Estelle. You’ll see what I mean when you read it.I’d love to have given this 5⭐ as so many other readers have. It probably deserves it. But for me it took too long to get to a part where I started to feel involved with the characters. And yes, I did guess what the four words were in the letter that Zara had been carrying in her handbag, unopened, for ten years. Otherwise, amazing.Please make sure you read the “Author’s Notes” at the end of the book too. They’ll have you sobbing too. Dare I suggest that Fredrik Backman is Sweden’s Matt Haig? Yes, I think he is. We need more of both of them.

Не сме достатъчни. Бакман събира на едно място социологическа извадка от тревожни хора в апартамент по време на оглед. Ще усетим кондензираното присъствие на Ана-Лена и Рогер, съпрузи на средна възраст, които не знаят как да намерят отново пътя един към друг; еднополовата двойка Юлан и Ру, които очакват първото си дете и ги тресе страха дали ще бъдат перфектните родители; банкерката Зара със супресирана емоционалност; възрастна вдовица, пристрастена към книгите; една твърде ентусиазирана брокерка и…заек. Тези хора са в центъра на нелепа заложническа криза, случайно провокирана от отчаян обирджия. Прибавете към това и двамата полицаи баща и син, които, разбира се, са в сложни отношения, и един трагичен случай отпреди десет години и имате една страхотна социална трагикомедия с чудесен финал. Всеки писател е добър в нещо. Някои ги бива да изграждат заплетен сюжет, други са майстори на природни описания, трети използват най-красивите метафори, четвърти конструират сложни психологически образи. Най-добрите сред най-добрите вероятно могат всичко това наведнъж. А това, което Бакман умее според мен, е да говори с гласа на днешния човек и неговите проблеми. Да, прави го по леко шантав начин, със заблуждаващо лек стил, но няма спор – неговите истории увличат и приобщават, всеки може да се припознае в тях. Всеки се пита дали се справя с живота си, или по-скоро – как да разбере дали се справя, дали другите са доволни от него, дали не е разочаровал някой по пътя.Животът става все по-изискващ, все по-отдалечаващ се от онази яснота, която е имало предното поколение, за което е било достатъчно да сключиш брак без да се питаш дали някой друг от многомилиардното човечество е по-перфектен за теб; за което да изхраниш и възпиташ децата си да бъдат добри хора е по-важно от това да отгледаш бъдещи гении; да преживееш поредния ден със смирението, че не си спасил света, но не си и навредил на никого; да намираш простите радости в ежедневието, а не да искаш постоянно да ти е интересно; да приемаш недостатъците на партньора ти, защото никой не е идеален, а не да се разделиш с него, защото избора на му на кафеварка показва, че няма стил. Не е лесно да си човек в 2020 година и Бакман го знае. Героите му успяват да се скарат жестоко, да се разплачат неколкократно (и вие с тях) и да се намерят отново, приемайки, че никак не са перфектни. И че това е ок. Но най-важната и болезнена тема, която съпътства историята в тази книга от началото до края като нейна сянка, е тази за самоубийството. Тема, за която обичайно нямаме сили да говорим, особено ако познаваме някой, който е избрал да напусне доброволно света на живите. За тънката граница между непосилното отчаяние и взетото окончателно решение. За случайното присъствие на непознатия на моста, който цели два пъти ще види хора, взели това решение, но ще успее да се намеси само веднъж. За това колко внимателни трябва да сме в постъпките и думите си към непознати, за да не ги докараме до онзи мост. И че трябва да търсим помощ, ако такава мисъл ни мине през ума.Ако и вие сте човек с тревоги над средното ниво (а няма причина да не сте), прочетете тази книга. Личи си, че при написването й Бакман се е консу��тирал с психолози, а личната му мотивация е негов близък, посегнал на живота си. И ако литературата може да утешава, лекува и дори спасява, „Тревожни хора“ е хапчето, което е добре да имате в домашната си аптечка. Ей така, за всеки случаи. Хора сме."

It rarely happens but this is one of those books for me. An amazing book by one of my most favorite authors. He is a master of creating complex flawed likeable characters.This story is about a bank robbery gone bad, resulting in a hostage situation full of quirky anxious hostages. This is the story of the hostages, the bank robber and the cops who are trying to locate the bank robber who seemingly disappeared. This story is poignant at times, laugh out loud funny at other times. Snippets of the story are told via police transcripts, which are comprised of some of the funniest dialogue I have ever read. Brilliant witty banter. This story has me reevaluating all of my ""all time favorites"" as this book just elevated the bar. I couldn't have loved it more."

147,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13798293-kristie,Rating 3 out of 5,"Based on the blurb and the author I really expected to love this one, but I struggled with the writing style for a good portion of the story. It initially felt like a 'stream of consciousness' writing, which didn't work for me. I liked the inclusion of the interviews and thought that they added to the storytelling, but the content of the interviews was frustrating to read. The officers, particularly the older officer, didn't seem all that intelligent or in control of the interviews, which gave it an unrealistic feeling. I understand why these were written the way they were, but I had difficulty believing that these were even remotely realistic interviews. There was about 10-15% towards the end of the book that I really enjoyed. Unfortunately, the very end seemed to go on too long as additional connections were made and loose ends tied up. I enjoyed the overall story, but didn't love the way it was told. I really expected something more. I have read most of Backman's previous books and really enjoyed most of them, so I was surprised that my issue was with the writing style. This one ended up being just average for me. I will continue to read Backman's work and look forward to seeing what else he comes out with. I believe a new Beartown book is expected next. Thank you to NetGalley and Atria Books for providing me with a free electronic copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. "

I have loved the other three books that I've read by Backman. He excels at creating characters that seem like they could walk out of the pages. I didn't find a Benji character in this one, but this one deserves all the stars.It's a hard one to describe, it's mostly the story of how people come together to help others who are in desperate times. Police men, ordinary citizens, therapists, all flawed humans who realize that sometimes people do dumb things when they don't see another way.I loved the father/son policemen who were bumbling through their job and the hostages who just didn't seem to cooperate!I'm so glad that I've finally had the chance to read this one.

151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64621419-dennis,Rating 4 out of 5,"An absolutely hilarious novel about serious things.Well, it’s Backman, right? However, this is different. While some topics like anxiety, suicide, marriage, death, parenthood etc. are very real – and there are some in-depth observations one is used to from this author – overall this is a very unlikely story. It’s not as grounded in reality as some of his other novels. It’s pretty absurd sometimes. Often in a good way.The beginning isn’t great, I have to say. Backman occasionally was almost too cynical for my liking. And also too meta. I wasn’t sure that kind of narration was going to work for me. The third-person narrator is too present, almost becomes a character himself. While I asked myself the question, is this how Fredrik Backman sees the world? It becomes distracting. However, when all the main characters are gathered in and around the apartment, the story about a bank robbery gone wrong (and turned hostage situation at an apartment viewing) comes to the forefront. With the narrator now only being the narrator the book reached another level. The middle part was comic genius.The characters are once again special. And they are idiots. But like the author himself says, “it’s always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is.” We’ll learn throughout the course of this story what makes life so idiotically difficult for these people. They all grew on me, as soon as I managed to understand them and their journey.Turns out Backman still believes in the good in people, and maybe I’m the one being too cynical. I needed some time to reflect, to be able to accept the ending for what it was. The appropriate conclusion to an unlikely story. This would potentially make one of the best Hollywood movies in years. Especially for the holiday season. But someone decided to turn this into a TV series. Idiots.Is this book on the same level as Backman’s best? I don’t think so. But like another reviewer once said about Philip K. Dick, the Pizza Rule applies to him; i.e. just as even bad pizza is still pretty good, bad Backman is still pretty good as well. And this is not bad at all.4.25 starsThis has been a buddy read with Alla, who really really really liked this book. (Yes, three reallys).*********Pre-review musings:Fredrik Backman is a special guy. He made that block of ice - that poses as my reader's heart - melt, and almost made me cry not once, but twice. With the acknowledgments! First because of something really sad and personal and then, seconds later, from laughing. Truly special."

It was heartwarming and touching. I will be thinking about this for days, and even weeks to come.Backman managed to strike a perfect balance between the humorous and serious topics. The novel was heartwarming, charming, witty and heartbreaking. I felt a million emotions reading this. What touched me the most was that a group of individuals were brought together and ultimately found comfort in each other without even knowing they needed it. I found that so beautiful.I loved the simplicity of the novel and the flawed and complex characters. Backman really knows how to write real and genuine characters. They were so vibrant and jumped off the page. He is also great at describing the feelings of loneliness, anxiety and hope unlike any other. Those feelings felt so tangible that I had to put down the book for a bit to absorb his words, because wow someone finally put those feelings into words!This book tugged at my heartstrings. I loved every single character in this book. They may be idiots, but they’re my idiots. I am looking forward to reading more of Backman’s works!"

158,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45796209-bkwmlee,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’ve been wanting to read a Fredrik Backman book for a while now (I have pretty much all of his previous works on my TBR), but hadn’t found the time to do so until recently when I was approved for an ARC of his latest novel 
Anxious People
 (which is scheduled for publication next month). Of course, I had high expectations going into this one given the reputation of the author — well, after I finished reading, my first reaction was: Wow! Now I know why Backman is such a beloved author to so many (my second reaction was: I need to go back and read all his previous books, like asap!). This book was so unlike anything I’ve read before. On the one hand, this was a sad story where each character had at least one (in some cases more) issue they were trying to deal with -- issues “serious” enough so as to make their lives seem utterly miserable and hopeless: be it a painful memory from their past that they were trying to suppress, worries over an uncertain future after entering a new stage in life, fear of losing loved ones due to circumstances beyond one’s control, feeling helpless in the face of life’s many injustices, etc. There were also some “heavy” topics explored in the story, such as death, suicide, divorce, betrayal, emotional and psychological distress, etc. But yet, this was not a “heavy” read at all – in fact, truth be told, this was actually one of the funniest books I’ve ever read! Yes, I know it sounds odd – after all, how can a story be so sad and heartrending one minute, to the point that I’m tearing up, yet so witty and hilarious the next minute that I found myself laughing until my insides hurt? Therein lies the brilliance in the way Backman crafted the story – the topics were heavy, yet the light-hearted tone in which this was written didn’t diminish the issues in any way...in fact, it did the opposite in that it actually made me pay more attention to the circumstances that caused the characters to be in the predicaments they ended up in.  Speaking of the characters, they were another reason why I loved this book so much. All the characters were so brilliantly written – every behavior, emotion, quirk, personality flaw, etc was so spot-on! Also, each character had distinctive personalities, yet their experiences and behaviors were so relatable and resonant on a personal level that with every single character, I actually found something in common either with myself or with someone in my life (in fact, I was nodding my head so often when I came across some familiar trait / habit / circumstance with the characters that I ended up with a neck cramp after I finished reading, lol). If I had to sum up this book, I would say that, in essence, this is an ingeniously-told, character-driven story that, at its heart, explores the trials and tribulations of what it means to be human.  Another thing I loved about this book was its cleverness in terms of structure. On the surface, it sounded like a really simple story – so simple in fact that, after the first 10 pages or so, I thought for sure the story was over, as what else was there to tell? A lot, it turned out! The “simple” story turned into multiple seemingly unrelated threads, with various tidbits of information added here and there as the story progressed that seemed to alter the narrative slightly -- just when I thought I had things figured out, well, it turns out I had nothing figured out at all! The way all the variant threads came together so perfectly and flawlessly at the end, I only have FIVE WORDS* to describe my reaction: Fredrik Backman is a genius! (*inside joke for those who read the book). If this review sounds a bit vague, note that this was done on purpose, as nothing I say (or write) about this book will be able to do it justice. You need to experience this wonderful book for yourself – and sooner rather than later! Oh and if you’re like me, who usually only skims the Acknowledgements section after finishing the book, you may want to actually read this one, as it was as much fun as reading the book itself!

I expected Anxious People to be good, but was a bit afraid it couldn’t live up to Beartown. While Beartown is still my favorite, this lived up to what I hope to get out of Backman. Anxious people could be unbelievable at times, but I think maybe that was part of the point. Backman always refers to fairytales and good stories, and that’s exactly what he told. I wasn’t attached to the characters at first, and thought- “nope- not gonna cry over this one.” But, once I got invested, that theory went out the window. Complex characters, fun storyline, and so, so much more. "

There were times that I was tired of it as I found repetitive. A small dose would have made me appreciate this book a lot more.The characters are interesting, although a bit rude, and nicely developed for such small book (I have never met a group so bizarre in a bizarre situation).The author’s understanding of the human nature is impressive and I believe that the translator did a great job.There are some great tender and moving moments but I wasn’t touched like I was while reading “Beartown”, my favourite book by this author."

Every other chapter repeats and the off chapters involve annoying and frustrating characters who do nothing to push the plot along. It’s as though they’re annoying for nothing. The characters are also depressing with divorce, homelessness, infidelity, suicide, etc. I read and read hoping to eventually feel like this book would redeem itself, but instead, I just started resenting it. I’m usually pretty lenient with books, but wow. This book was so annoying that it made me angry. I want my time back. And I get that it was meant to be a comedy, but unless you like jokes based on pedantic annoyances, this book isn’t funny. (And for the record, I have GAD, and this is nothing like how many anxious people act. To act as so is a disservice to those folks working through their anxiety.)"

My favorite Swedish writer is back with a series of quirky characters and one heck of a very strange scenario. But as I have realized in reading Frederik Backman's books, it's better to tighten your seatbelt and enjoy the ride than to ask serious questions. I was more than ready to read one of my eagerly anticipated novels of the fall.  A bank robbery. A hostage drama. A stairwell full of police officers on their way to storm the apartment. It was easy to get to this point, much easier than you think. All it took was one single really bad idea. This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiotsI don't know about my fellow readers but I enjoy a story in which several flawed individuals manage to make a situation even more crazy than it originally was. No doubt Backman was amazed by what police officers Jack and Jim had to encounter during the interview of the witnesses. All I know was I couldn't stop laughing. But I don't want people to walk in thinking it's just straight up comedy. Rather there are some fairly serious topics that Backman tackles- infidelity, suicide, mental illness etc. These are handled with the most care and as the storyline progressed I became increasingly attached to Zara, Jules and Ro, Roger and Anna-Lena, Estelle and even the rabbit ( you'll see)!

I’ve never been able to finish it, and because of that I’ve unfairly written off Backman and everything else he’s written since then. Oh, I’m aware of his books. I see people reading them and loving them, but I just shrug him off every time. Until now. Anxious People had a compelling plot m, and I decided to give this guy another shot. Hot damn, I’m so glad I did! I seriously can’t remember the last time I had this much fun reading a book. Probably Then We Came to the End by Joshua Ferris. I guess I can remember. There’s probably plenty of other times, too. Man, I loved this book. Anxious People is a lot of things, and it openly admits that to you as you read through it. There is a bank robbery. There is a hostage situation. There are twists and turns. There is a lot of humor. Oh, and there are anxious people. Anxious police officers, anxious hostages, and anxious bank robbers. The book bounced around a lot, moving the story forward, revealing more details, but it also spends time unpacking all of the characters in interesting ways. It’s a pretty moving story, too. It’s not really about the robbery or hostage situation. Those things are definitely there, and there are plenty of twists along the way related to them, but the story is ultimately about the anxious people. There are so many underlineable quotes or sentences in this thing, so much that I felt like I could relate to. I don’t want to give away much, but the main themes of the book are pretty universal, and I think there is something for everyone here. It’s a lot of things at once, but this book is just a lot of fun to read. I was laughing out loud often, and I was a lot of other emotions at other times. I had a tough time stepping away from this story to do life stuff, and I highly recommend this to everyone who likes books (which includes you). If you don’t like books, I’m not sure why you’re here or on Goodreads at all. I’m now going to check out more Backman books. Here’s to second, third. And fourth chances. "

I have loved each one, having never felt let down. The characters he conjures up are unique, his creative and complex storytelling brilliant.This book was yet another joy to read. Backman’s interconnecting characters are flawed humans, quirky and unpredictable. His insight into the ups and downs of human behavior, the ins and outs of relationships flow in an absolutely perfect way. One of my favorites of the year!"

Ali to naravno nije istina, barem ne u potpunosti, jer kada bi naša prošlost bila sve što nas definiše, ne bismo bili u stanju da podnesemo sami sebe. Moramo imati priliku da sami sebe ubijedimo da smo nešto više od grešaka koje smo počinili juče. I da predstavljamo svaki naš sljedeći izbor i svako naše sutra.Knjiga koja vrca od naivne duhovitosti, šarmantnosti i duboke ironije. Ovdje je sve naopačke. Ova priča lovi čitaoca od samog njenog početka, lovi ga na radoznalost. Priča je koncipirana da se ide iz mnoštva ka jednom. Bakman pokazuje kako ljudi samo dok se drže zajedno mogu da prevaziđu mnoge terete, i da sve što se desilo ili se dešava, ili će se desiti je samo istorija i proizvod neminovne ljudske sudbine koja je neumorna, i čiji su konci međusobno povezani. Ona počinje u jednom sumračnom tonu, potom polako tone u mekoću gdje se intimnost gasi, a onda odjednom neki nagli izlivi radosnih okolnosti. Iako se čini da je Bakman nekako preračunao junake, bilo njihovom simpatijom i antipatijom, usamljenošću i sudbinksom poznanstvu, on ih ne ostavlja praznim. Svi likovi kao da su dostojni svoje pažnje s obzirom na teatralno izvođnje svojih izvještaja o događaju. Svijet kakav je Bakman predstavio u ovom dijelu je naša otužna svakodnevnica.Banka, most, nekretnina. Ove tri riječi biće dovoljne da se zamrse i odmrse konci, i ispripovijeda ni više ni manje nego jedna zanimljiva priča o idiotima."

Anxious People isn't my first Fredrik Backman book; that honour goes to the hilarious, A Man Called Ove, a book I laugh about often.So, I opened the book, and of course, I read the dedication.""This book is dedicated to the voices in my head, the most remarkable of my friends.And to my wife, who lives with us.""I laughed. Yes, my sense of humour is fully intact. I thought I'd mention it because this is supposed to be a funny book. Still, I spent significant time rolling my eyes and adding permanent frown lines to my forehead. (That's not good—anti-wrinkle cream isn't cheap.)I stopped reading at the 40% mark; my review reflects that. I don't know what happened. I was excited to start, but I am disappointed. I didn't connect or care about the characters. The writing was wordy and overbearing. The police interviews were unrealistic; I felt like I was reading a TV sitcom script. Now I understand the book is about idiots. But it would be rather idiotic to continue reading when my level of enjoyment equals zero. Beartown is on my to-read list, so I'm not giving up on Fredrik Backman. However, I'm hoping Beartown has more Ove and a little less Anxious."

(Yes, I know that novel is beloved and I'm in the minority for not liking it, but that's how it is.) Anyway, my friend knew that I hadn't cared for the Ove novel, but she insisted she thought I would like this new book, so I gave it a listen. First, I have to share that ""Anxious People"" is a great audiobook, narrated by the marvelous Marin Ireland. Her different voices for the characters were simply fantastic. It's been a few weeks since I finished it, and I'm still giggling about her performance of some of the bits in the book.There is no way to accurately describe the plot, other than to say it follows a group of characters who happen to be connected to an apartment viewing, which coincidentally is near a bank, which happened to be the place of an attempted robbery that same day. Hijinks ensue.I was a bit astonished at how cleverly the author wove together all the various plot points and characters. There was also a surprisingly thoughtful discussion of the problems with the banking and real estate systems, and their negative effects on society — none of which I was expecting but I appreciated it was there.In short, this novel was a delight, and also a pleasant distraction during an incredibly intense news cycle following the presidential election. Highly recommended if you enjoy clever comic novels that have a lot of heart."

It is the story of a would-be bank robber who attempts to rob a cashless bank and, to avoid the police, runs across the street and ends up in an apartment viewing. Thus, the robbery becomes a hostage situation with the quirkiest set of hostages imaginable. I almost did not finish the book. The initial police interviews with an irritating real-estate agent and a hostile, defensive apartment viewer were over the top. However, I decided to stick with it. I listen to books on tape when I do my chores, and when I started to realize that I was looking forward to doing the dishes, I knew that Backman had hooked me yet again. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It is a great escape written with humor and heart."

This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiots.Sadly Anna-Lena was about as good at whispering as she was thinking quietly, so it was pretty much the sort of shouted whisper that's the equivalent of a fart in an airplane that you think won't be noticed if you let it out a bit at a time.

Take one inept bank robber that crashes a real estate showing when trying to escape, add in a father-son police duo that struggles to get any useful information out of the ‘hostages’ during their interrogations, and discover how a suicide from a bridge still haunts many in this group.

We don’t have time to think or breathe, we just wake up and start digging through the heap, because there will be another one dumped on us tomorrow.A bank robber escaped, going to the nearest building, then going to the first open door in that building, there are other people in the room so the bank robber took all of them as hostages. Police surrounded the building, the bank robber had to give up because there was no other choice and there was no way to escape anymore. So all the hostages were released, the police stormed the apartment but it was empty with blood on the floor, no one knew where the bank robber was and then the story begins…This is my third read by this author but the writing here is a bit different from my previous read by him! It isn't as good as “A Man Called Ove” (which I loved the most) but it's close. I enjoyed this too, so much, it surprised me with the main twist, and when it was revealed I was laughing because the author tricked me so well! There are moments that make you think and there are moments that make you smile. It’s well-written, a real page-turner that grabbed my attention from the first chapter!

182,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39272121-marilyn-trying-to-catch-up,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have read almost all of Fredrik Blackman's prior novels and have loved them all. Anxious People was different from anything that he had previously written in my opinion. It was brilliant and yet so quirky in both the writing and the plot. This story was most definitely character driven and even though each character was uniquely different they all found a connection with one another. Blackman was able to put the most unlikely people together and have them be rewarded with the gifts of self discovery, human compassion, forgiveness, love, friendship, coming to terms with grief, loneliness and even trauma. I was so excited to read Anxious People and I was not disappointed. As I already stated, the plot was brilliant. Who thinks to base their book on a bank robbery that took place in a cashless bank, about bridges, hostages and idiots? Fredrik Blackman was able to weave an outstanding plot around all those things. The unfortunate but desperate bank robber chose the wrong bank to rob. The amount the bank robber wanted was quite specific. It was not an enormous amount of money. The amount was just enough to pay a month's rent but no matter how much or little the bank robber intended to take it was useless in a cashless bank. Faced with being caught by the police, the bank robber escaped the bank and found refuge in an apartment building across the street from the bank. The bank robber took the steps in the apartment building looking for an exit. The higher the bank robber climbed the stairs the more it became evident that there was no other way out of the building. Quite by accident, the bank robber noticed that an apartment door was open. With no apparent choice left, the bank robber entered the apartment to find that it was being viewed by potential buyers. The bank robber, still wearing a face mask and holding a gun, joined the group of perspective buyers. All of a sudden, there was a hostage situation. Could it be described as a hostage situation in the true sense of the word, though?All the characters in Anxious People were so real. I loved how they all fit together and had connections even if those connections did not come together all at once. Some of the characters were even comical like the Rabbit hostage. Some were definitely easy to relate to, and yet complex like elderly Estelle or pregnant Julia and her fiance Ro. I laughed out loud at some parts, rolled my eyes at other parts, and even cried. This was one of the best novels I have read in a long time. The human connection was what made it so real for me. The themes of suicide, metal illness and death were apparent throughout the novel and yet it wasn't at all depressing. Finding hope, having someone to talk to and working through difficult situations in life is key. I would highly recommend Anxious People by Fredrik Blackman. My rating is 4.5 stars. Anxious People will be published on September 8, 2020. I received a complimentary digital version of this book from Atria Books through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. All opinions expressed in this review are my own."

Kas dar nepamilot – tikriausiai čia ne ta, kurią rekomenduočiau ilgos meilės pradžiai. Ar visiškai visiškai objektyviai ši knyga yra verta 5*? Ne, tikriausiai ne. Bet pabandykit mane sustabdyti, kai Backmanas yra Kalėdos, minkštutėlis pledas, kakava po ilgos dienos lauke žiemą, karšto vyno puodelis, Astridos Lindgren reinkarnacija suaugusiems ir tvirčiausias apkabinimas viename? Tuo pat metu čia jis beveik veiksmo filmas – jei mėgstat Simono Peggo filmus, jei jus žavi visokie švelnūs nevykėliai, jei patinka filmai, kur iš tiesų vyksta labai mažai, bet visi tik daug kalba ir gyvenimai pasikeičia, jeigu absurdas prie širdies, o labiausiai prie širdies tiesiog Backmanas, tai pramuš ir „Nerimo žmonės“.Šita knyga šiek tiek primena kokią indie britišką komediją – absurdiškiausios situacijos, keistos lokacijos, labai daug skausmo, kuris šiaip su gyvenimu eina koja kojon, logikos dėsnius pažeidžiantis siužetas ir noras juoktis, kai širdis truputį plyšta. Vienas tų atvejų, kai atpažinsit kiekvieną veikėją – tiek iš Backmano jau skaitytų knygų, tiek iš savo pačių gyvenimų. Labai norint čia TIKRAI yra kur vartyti akis, o kai kurios vietos jau laviruoja ant ribos, kurią brėžia autoriaus kritikai – na gi čia beveik Lindgreniškas Coelho, jums rimtai fainai? Bet net kai jis sako dalykus, kurie savaime aiškūs, vis tiek moka pasakyti taip, kad pasijauti lyg grįžęs namo. Nesutikčiau su kai kuriomis apžvalgomis, kad čia – skaudžiausia Backmano knyga – tiesą sakant, man ji tikriausiai labiausiai pasakinė ir plaukianti paviršiumi. Bet vis tiek galima sužymėti visus Backmaniškus laukelius, dėl kurių autorių ir pamilome, tai po kaulelį nenarstysiu – gi ir per Kalėdas su šeima ne viskas vienodai patinka, o širdis vis tiek lieka pilna meilės."

Two policemen, father and son, work on this case. And one of them ends up helping the girl, too. Like, seriously?

Да, он добрый и пишет о доброте и любви, об альтруизме, эмпатии и о том, что никогда нельзя судить о людях по внешности или даже поведению. Его герои несимпатичны на первый взгляд, но это первое впечатление. Они несут в себе боль, которую не всегда могут выразить и высказать, и не могут спокойно жить с нею. Зара выглядит циничной и высокомерной стервой-банкиршей, но оказалось, что это внешнее впечатление. Она десять лет не могла совладать со своей болью. Да, ей нужен был психолог, но не для бессонницы и не для депрессии, а для того, чтобы простить себя, совладать с одиночеством и начать жить. Сначала пара Анна-Лена и Рогер казались алчными злыднями, которые разрушают сделки купли-продажи квартир, придираются к мелочам, сбивают цену, а потом сами покупают для перепродажи после ремонта. Но, оказалось, они любящие супруги, способные на самопожертвование ради другого. 50-летний голый мужик с неснимаемой головой кролика по определению вызывает отвращение, но и он оказывается неплохим человеком. Умница Зара не посмотрела бы на него, если бы он совершенным ничтожеством. «…быть человеком – дело вообще трудное до безумия. Особенно если рядом с тобой люди, перед которыми ты пытаешься выглядеть хорошим.» Лесбийская пара с их постоянным желанием есть, также потом оказались милейшими девчонками. Эстель, которая не прочь выпить, растрогала своей историей о муже и соседе. Отец с сыном тоже вели себя как идиоты, гугля что делать при захвате заложников. Бакман очень точно охарактеризовал профессиональные мотивы: в конце карьеры человек стремится к смыслу, в начале - к цели. Но и они совсем не идиоты, приняв единственное верное с человеческой точки зрения решение. Хотя с точки зрения закона, они конечно, идиоты. У всех героев романа, не только находившихся в квартире, были свои комплексы, демоны, страхи, приведшие к обидам, усталости, беспокойству, одиночеству, но благодаря эмпатии, которая оказалась возможна только тогда, когда бег времени остановился, и люди смогли раскрыть свои души.Мне понравилась концепция «стокгольмцев». Мы все стокгольмцы, когда мы дома – мы презираем/не всегда, но иногда раздражаемся или даже избегаем/не обращаем внимания/вежливо отделываемся, когда видим приезжих из провинции или мигрантов, если живем в крупных городах. Но когда мы сами путешествуем и оказываемся в еще больших столицах, или более развитых странах, мы осознаем, что «стокгольмцы» относятся к нам пренебрежительно или вежливо, но с плохо скрываемым равнодушием или просто высокомерно, и нас это задевает. Нам всем нужно быть терпимее.В конце немного показалась неестественной сентиментальность про Мартышку, Лягушку и Лося и их маму. Эстель поступила хорошо, оказав помощь в аренде квартиры, но вообще, с точки зрения здравого финансового смысла, сейчас люди не ведут себя ни как Зара, ни как Эстель. Большинство внезапно теряют все - как грабитель, которую бросил и выселил из квартиры муж и шефиня-любовница уволила с работы, и тот человек, который прыгнул с моста (если помните, он вложил все деньги в акции предприятия, занимавшегося недвижимостью.) Конечно, Бакман хочет убедить нас, что надо расстаться с привязанностью к мат��риальным благам и жить ради доброты. Но он сам себе противоречит, поскольку именно экономическая система, если хотите банки, пенсионная система, инфляция и спекулянты (от биржевых и по недвижимости до оптовых поставщиков продовольствия) сделали людей такими, какие они сейчас есть – равнодушными, черствыми, алчными, думающими только о себе. И проблемы ментального здоровья прямо или косвенно из-за экономической системы. Даже у успешной Зары было чувство вины перед тем самоубийцей, который отправил ей письмо перед смертью. Потому что сейчас жизнь упирается в деньги, а должна упираться в человеческое отношение друг другу – альтруизм, взаимопомощь, дружбу, любовь, доброту. Спасибо Бакману, что напоминает нам об этом."
187,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara,Rating 5 out of 5,"Fredrik Backman is the new Anne Tyler. I used to read Anne in my younger days and be amazed at how she could take a group of quirky characters and make them all real, flesh and blood people. Backman does the same thing. In less skilled hands, these people might seem absurd, but they are not, they are normal, just not cookie-cutter, and Backman makes you love them, laugh at them, and understand them. This is the story of a bank robbery, uh, no it’s the story of a man jumping off a bridge, nope, it’s the story of a hostage situation that goes berserk. In truth, it is the story of how complete strangers can affect one another, how things can not be what they seem to be, how your preconceived ideas of who and what people are can be upside-down. But that’s just my opinion. Here is what the narrator says, and his assessment is quite true:This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiots. So it needs saying from the outset that it’s always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is.I could personally relate. I feel like an idiot a lot more now that I am older than I ever did when I was young. In fact, there is hardly a day that goes by that I don’t mutter to myself, “don’t be stupid”. But, that is the state of being in charge, not having parents or anyone older to help guide you...people who were probably just as lost as you, but appeared to have the key to wisdom. You aren’t ever going to be a child again and have someone else just solve your problems, and might be that no one even cares about you enough to ask what the problems are.Because the terrible thing about becoming an adult is being forced to realize that absolutely nobody cares about us, we have to deal with everything ourselves now, find out how the whole world works.This quotation seemed to nail how we all feel at times, like everyone else has the key to the door, while we need a sledgehammer if we expect to get inside.We look around occasionally, at our place of work or at parents’ meetings or out in the street, and realize with horror that everyone else seems to know exactly what they’re doing. We’re the only ones who have to pretend. Everyone else can afford stuff and has a handle on other stuff and enough energy to deal with even more stuff. And everyone else’s children can swim.Or, this beautiful and profound description of what it is to lose your mate:“He was my echo. Everything I do is quieter now,” she said to the other women in the closet.I could fill pages with quotes from the book that made me nod my head up and down in agreement. I laughed out-loud with these characters, and felt their pains that they all carried and tried to conceal, with varying degrees of success.This (I promise the last) quotation might be the one that got to the heart of the book for me:We’re just strangers passing each other, your anxieties briefly brushing against mine as the fibers of our coats touch momentarily on a crowded sidewalk somewhere. We never really know what we do to each other, with each other, for each other.Because, in the end, we are all just people doing the best we can, making some very bad decisions that we hope won’t catch up to us or, if they do, won’t destroy our lives. We ought to pay attention to those around us, even strangers, who might just need one kind word, one moment of our time, a pat of the hand, to get through that tough day without making the biggest mistake of all...the one that cannot ever be corrected. Perhaps we all hold the solutions to one another’s problems, but fail to notice. Maybe Fredrik Backman is saying look out more than in, for when you open your eyes, you might also open your heart."

If you read his A Man Called Ove you know what I'm talking about. This book is about a hostage crisis, one bridge, a kid's drawing and yet maybe it's not. Even if you, for a split of a second, get the feeling that you've all figured it out, don't rush. As in life, things aren't always as they seem. After you finish reading this masterpiece, you'll surely look at things from a different perspective. I know that last night, when the book was closed, I was smiling. And I wrapped my arms around my son although it was the hottest night so far this year. I have to mention the Serbian translator, Nikola Perišić, who once again did a fantastic job! "

195,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17557841-lori-keeton,Rating 5 out of 5,"This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiots. So it needs saying from the outset that it's always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is. Especially if you have other people you're trying to be a reasonably good human for.If that doesn't make you want to grab Frederik Backman's newest novel right now and dig in, then read another poignant quote:Because there's such an unbelievable amount that we're all supposed to be able to cope with these days. You're supposed to have a job, and somewhere to live, and a family, and you're supposed to pay taxes and have clean underwear and remember the password to your damn Wi-Fi. Some of us never manage to get the chaos under control, so our lives simply carry on, the world spinning through space at two million miles an hour while we bounce about on its surface like so many lost socks. Our hearts are bars of soap that we keep losing hold of; the moment we relax, they drift off and fall in love and get broken, all in the wink of an eye. We're not in control. So we learn to pretend, all the time, about our jobs and our marriages and our children and everything else...we just do our best to get through the day, because there'll be another one coming along tomorrow.Sometimes it hurts, it really hurts, for no other reason than the fact that our skin doesn't feel like it's ours. Sometimes we panic, because the bills need paying and we have to be grown-up and we don't know how, because it's so horribly, desperately easy to fail at being grown-up.Anxious People is chock full of fantastic quotes and scenes, I could go on and on, but that would ruin your experience of reading this for yourselves. I am always so impressed with how Backman can realistically write flawed characters that we all probably know in our own lives. The people you will meet in this quirky tale are not very likable. I need a likable character to love and I was a bit worried that I wasn't going to be satisfied. Backman, however, has the uncanny ability to take such unlovable people - idiots in their own ways - and make you fall in love with them. Bravo to Backman for having such a skill!There is really much to love in this seemingly strange and chaotic affair. In Backman's story, he captures a reality of life for a group of disparate misfits with nothing in common on the surface and connects them with each other in ways that you'll never imagine. There is a pair of bumbling, not-too-swift policemen, a retired couple who flip houses to keep their marriage interesting, a young couple panicking at becoming parents, and a wine-loving elderly opinionated woman. There is also a snobby, wealthy banker who dislikes people and a silly realtor with no sense at all. The voices Backman gives these characters are so real to life that I nodded right along reading their conversations and thoughts. I own and have read all of Backman's novels now. I'm still amazed at how he writes what people think about and maybe don't talk about and sometimes it's painful. But he also can make you laugh in the next paragraph and that's what makes him so good. It's as if he's up in our brains writing down all of our anxieties onto his pages in the words of his characters. In this story, we get the sense of all the little moments in life and how much they mean to us as individuals and collectively. It may be a story of a bank robbery turned into a hostage situation on the surface, but like the characters, there's much, much more to it than you'll ever imagine. Pick this up and read it. You won't be disappointed!!Everyone inside the apartment had their own complexes, their own demons and anxieties.They may not have had much in common, but they all knew what it was like to make a mistake."

Pay bills. Taxes. A family to support. Remember passwords. Which way does the USB lead go when you try to plug it in? People are idiots.A failed bank robbery. A hostage drama. A really bad idea. It is not easy being human … especially when you have other people you are trying to be good for. All it takes is one really bad idea. That is how it starts.A bank robber tries to hold up a cashless bank then flees across the street to an apartment where a realtor is having a viewing. You have an enthusiastic realtor, a wealthy bank director who goes to apartment viewings to see how ordinary people live, a retired couple who buy apartments to fix up but can't fix their own marriage, a lesbian couple expecting their first child and who can't agree on anything, an elderly woman who is old enough not to be impressed by a bank robber waving a gun, and a man wearing a rabbit's head … and not much else.The police arrive and in this small town the responding officers are a father and son. While they try to decide how to resolve the situation before ""the Stockholmer's"" arrive the drama plays out on television stations live.The bank robber in this situation really isn't a bad person. Rather a person who had a really bad idea. After a while when the people tell their stories and get to know each other better the bank robber lets the hostages go. But when the police storm the apartment there is no bank robber. How did the robber manage to escape?In interviews at the police station the hostages each tell their own version of what happened. What we have is a group of dysfunctional people and a locked room mystery. If you enjoyed A Man Called Ove I think you will enjoy this. A group of disparate people thrown together. It is sad. It is funny. It is idiotic.Thank you to Goodreads and Atria Books for the opportunity to read this Advanced Reading Copy."

I wish I read this a couple of years ago (wasn’t released tho). My friend Sushma recommended this! (Thank you Sushma! ♡)I buddy read this with Jenna and Orla :)This really is a book about quirky idiots. I loved every single character and I loved how the author talked about everything ranging from mental illnesses to love and marriage. ”Do you know what, Zara? One of the most human things about anxiety is that we try to cure chaos with chaos. Someone who has got themselves into a catastrophic situation rarely retreats from it, we’re far more inclined to carry on even faster. We’ve created lives where we can watch other people crash into the wall but still hope that somehow we’re going to pass straight through it. The closer we get, the more confidently we believe that some unlikely solution is miraculously going to save us, while everyone watching us is just waiting for the crash.”Zara, Anna-Lena, Roger and of course, the robber were executed really well.I loved the style of narration. I was surprised at all the details I missed during all the loops and turns of the story.I friggin loved Estelle’s elevator backstory.I have a huge list of quotes that I loved in this book. This one’s definitely worth a reread.To say the least, this book ripped my heart out, tore it apart and put it back in. I was ugly crying by the end.Total time spent: 6h 45min."

This is one of the very early lines in Anxious People, and one of the best I have read in some time. This is a story about a lot of things - a bank robbery, a hostage drama, a bridge. It's about anxiety and vulnerability and love. But above all it is a story about hope. Some characters are instantly likeable, while the rest take time to grow on you. And there are a lot of characters. What Backman does so beautifully yet again is the characterization of each and every one of them. He makes sure that we really look at them, understand where they come from and show us how we often judge people too quickly. Being human might be idiotically difficult, but how Backman writes about humanity is absurdly close to perfect. Only a couple of twists near the end seemed a bit fantastical to me, to suit a perfect ending. Too much like a fairy tale, a little less realistic. But all said and done, I really loved the book. Not a lot of books manage to leave us with lingering feelings of hope. This one did just that."

Bunica mi-a provocat imaginația și a șters pe furiș granița dintre ficțiune și realitate. Scandalul și Noi contra voastră m-au secat de lacrimi și de energie, iar inima încă-mi tresare când mă gândesc la Benji, unul dintre cele mai complexe, imprevizibile și curajoase personaje din operele lui Backman. Iar după atât de multe emoții contradictorii, drame de familie și întâmplări care redefinesc semnificația cuvintelor „tragedie”, „prietenie” și „societate”, autorul scoate la lumină noi prejudecăți în Oameni anxioși, un roman delicios de savuros, cu un comic de situație ce l-ar fi făcut invidios până și pe maestrul Ion Luca Caragiale.Doar Fredrik Backman ar fi putut să își imagineze un astfel de scenariu: o vizionare de apartament, organizată cu o zi înainte de revelion, transformată în cea mai stranie și nonconformistă luare de ostatici la care am luat vreodată (involuntar) parte, după ce un spărgător de bănci fuge de la locul faptei. Dacă ignor cutiile goale de pizza, sângele de pe covor, sticlele goale de vin și iepurele uriaș (care mă salută stânjenit chiar și de pe copertă), văd din nou camera de interogatoriu din secția de poliție, unde un duo tată-fiu încearcă să afle cum a dispărut spărgătorul și ce s-a întâmplat cu adevărat în acel apartament „căptușit” într-un ritm record cu secrete, confesiuni și regrete.Oameni anxioși menține la cote înalte stilul inconfundabil al autorului, însă este o gură de aer proaspăt și o viziune dureros de realistă a societății, mascată sub forma unei parodii din care nu lipsesc personaje excentrice, unele chiar la limita suportabilității, situații absurde, dialoguri seci și minunat de ironice, și o atmosferă aflată în continuă schimbare, ce alternează între cea specifică unui thriller și ambianța veselă, plină de culoare și optimism, potrivită pentru o comedie, nu pentru o luare de ostatici."
201,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8338960-darla,Rating 5 out of 5,"Backman could not have chosen a better time to write a book about anxious people. They are all around us in 2020. I am fascinated by the storytelling genius that Backman once again exhibits in this multi-layered narrative. Is this about a bank robbery? A hostage situation? A police investigation? A bridge? An apartment? Mental health? Family? Loneliness? Yes. All of the above and more. A dual timeline depicting before and after the resolution of the hostage situation is interspersed with transcripts of the police interviews. Throughout, Backman uses a detached approach to poke fun of our culture while at the same time affirming the beauty of humanity. As in Ove, the subject of suicide is a prevalent theme and a page with resources for those considering that option is included in the end notes. I would also like to add God's word as a resource, specifically Psalm 34:18; ""The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.""Thank you to Atria Books and Edelweiss+ for a DRC in exchange for an honest review."

Povestea in sine este amuzanta, o serie intreaga de personaje care mai de care mai ciudati, amuzanti, reali, dsr scriitura este cea care m-a incantat cel mai tare.

This may be your best one yet.Guys, this one will make you laugh, make you cry, make you think at his profound way of connecting everyday people into something special.All of these characters are so relatable and real Backman and connects them in a unique setting. A hostage situation gone amiss with a group of people that all have their flaws, but are still loveable.I think while Backman writes for our pleasure, he also writes for us to take away something, and to become maybe just a little better as a human."

Mas também é sobre muito mais que isso. É sobre como cada um de nós carregamos nossas frustrações, traumas, medos, sonhos, amores correspondidos (ou não) e segredos. É sobre como estamos mais ligados às outras pessoas do que podemos imaginar, e como só precisamos de alguém para ouvir nossas histórias. É, também, uma história engraçada com situações improváveis, personagens marcantes e um mistério a ser resolvido.“This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiots. So it needs saying from the outset that it’s always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is.”Eu gostei muito de fazer essa leitura! Comecei despretensiosamente: sabia que ia gostar, mas não imaginava que não conseguiria largá-la. Ouvi o audiobook (com uma narração INCRÍVEL de Marin Ireland) em dois dias. É aquela história que me pegou logo do começo, com uma narrativa inteligente e um mistério intrigante, e me impressionou até o final.Tudo aqui é muito bem feito. O que mais me preocupava era a quantidade de personagens. Sou péssimo com nomes. O jeito que o autor os apresenta, porém, fez com que eu decorasse muito bem quem era quem e soubesse suas histórias com profundidade. São oito ou mais histórias de vidas, mostrando que ninguém é só o que parece na superfície.“God doesn't protect people from knives, sweetheart. That's why God gave us other people, so we can protect each other.”O ritmo do livro é simplesmente PERFEITO. Alternando passado e presente, ele conta a história de cada personagem, o momento em que foram feitos de reféns e o interrogatório da polícia. Não tem um momento em que ele ficasse chato ou perdesse a graça. Os capítulos serem curtinhos (a maioria, pelo menos) foi algo que ajudou bastante. A todo momento, eu só queria conhecer mais sobre essas pessoas e entender o que aconteceu com todas elas.Se tem uma coisa que 2020 me entregou foram boas histórias. Mal posso esperar para assistir à adaptação da Netflix de Anxious People e gritar quando o livro for publicado no Brasil. Recomendo!"
205,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43708514-cm,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved this book!! I love Backman's writing style in general, I really just connect with it. If you enjoyed his pervious books, I'm sure you will like this one as well. His books always cover one of my favorite topics, which is seeing the world through the eyes of someone else. He is so good at enabling people to see the same situation through many different lenses. He really leaves you thinking about the fact that you never truly know what is going on in somebody else's life or head. Everyone has their own struggles to deal with in life and we never truly know how we will react in a situation until we are actually in it. We all see the world through our past experiences, so different people can take different things away from the exact same situation. This book also talks alot about kindness and forgiveness. It felt very wholesome, heartwarming and deep, with some humor thrown in there as well. We all need to be just a little bit more kind, understanding and forgiving of the people we encounter in our lives. This book is definitely very character based and doesn't focus a lot on the plot. If you are looking for a fast paced book then this may not be the book for you. Otherwise, I absolutely recommend this book!"

207,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Look- this was beautiful. Like so beautifully written and I'm just so fucking in love with Backman's books also determined to read every single of his book for this year. The way this a very heartwarming plot. Like that very warm hand-knitted sweater from your love one that is very warm and every time you put it on it feels like a warm embrace from the one who made it for you. It's just so cozy, warm, and comforting yet so chaotically funny at the same time.You know, this very book makes me realized that I have a thing with plot lines with several main characters with each different stories to tell get intertwined unexpectedly like it was some kind of fate and in the end they found a family that isn't blood related. I proudly admit that I'm such a sucker for this type of plot. Fredrik Backman is the master of this story.Now onto the review. This was a lot different than A Man Called Ove in terms of writing. I actually didn't know that this was a pretty short and fast-paced read. I just assumed this would be the type of book that won't have many dialogs in it and mostly recounting stories of the past, so I just immediately took a shot in the audiobook. Well, I suppose I don't see that it matters if you decide to enjoy from which senses you want but it won't be terribly boring or a tad bit difficult to digest through the eyes. I love it! That this was a very fast-paced and actually I could definitely finished it in a day but I'm far busy to sit down and enjoy an audiobook these days. I have no complains in the writing, I already know that Backman would do a good job on it. It's not rushing or dragging, the flow was perfect for a fast paced book, it wasn't boring or there weren't unnecessary part in my hearing. Also, it's Fredrik Backman. You know how beautifully eloquent his writing is. So no complains. The plot was refreshing, like who tf would thought to write a bank robber robbing a bank gone wrong? And freaking peppered with a lot of mushy feelings on top of it with a topping of a lot of heartwarming scenes. It was something that I have never read and I enjoyed it so much. It was witty, funny, chaotic, and just fucking beautiful. You know what? I think I'm going to add this for my yearly read. Yes, I think I'm going to do that. Now the characters... flawless. Ha. I got you there, didn't I? Well I said what I said, I have no complains. This book is just perfect and that includes the characters and each of their developments. But if I have only to really describe each of them in two words? It would be beautifully colorful. I love that they have their own unique quirks and story and background. I love that they have each their own sadness and insecurities. I love that they all in one point found the same ground to stand together. There were no characters that felt blurry, or inconsistent, or unclear. They're all perfect to their each flaws. Colorful. They're all so beautifully colorful characters. Now, take this 5 stars from me cause I want to sit in the corner and curl up and silently shed my tears. No- but seriously this is a beautiful book and I really recommend this to each one of you who hasn't read this book. Oh and also, if you guys ever read a book like this with similar story or vibes or authors that write similar vibes with Backman, please do recommend it to me by commenting down below!💖 thanks a lot!"

It somehow manages to talk about complex and painful issues such as suicide, insecurity in life and our daily struggles at adulting in such a quirky and funny, yet graceful way you wouldn’t believe it.In the end… I was speechless. This book was EVERYTHING, it was deep, funny and wonderful. After I finished it, I sat wide-eyed for a while, not knowing what to even write in my review. Anxious People encompasses kindness, our fumbling humanity, community, loneliness and feeling like you’re so alone and desperate, you may not want to live anymore. It tackles heavy and painful subjects, but it does so in such a graceful manner that you want to quote it to everyone you know. It puts the pin right into the center of the matter, and with some things in this book, I truly felt that the author simply said what I wanted to say all along about things, about life – except I couldn’t find the words – and he did it for me.

People don’t want to buy a picture, they want to buy a frame.
like i’ve mentioned in my previous reviews, i don’t fuck with happy books, especially the ones which have bows neatly tight at the end of the story but what can i say, even i can change my mind about it.the story is about a bank robbery gone incredibly wrong and then turned into a hostage situation and it is as much fun to read as it sounds, if not more! this is my first Fredrik Backman book and idk if all his books are like this but his writing and character work is similar to one of my favourite authors, Emily St. John Mandel except that the latter one writes bleak (AF) stories. i loved the father-son dynamic and how important their wife and mom (respectively, duh) played in their lives. i loved the hostages, the bank robber, their relationship among each other...this was just the book i needed to read before my uni starts but at the same time im mad that i couldn’t read the book sooner! if all the author’s books are like this then i might start his other ones too but like i said i can’t read happy books all the time so maybe his other book(s) will also serve the same purpose like this one has, for me."

❝This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about Idiots❞
This is in the first line of this book 😅... and I just knew I was in for one hell of a read and I’ll tell you for nothing… it did NOT disappoint! Firstly you’re going to need patience to read this book. The book is indeed about 
“idiots”.
 But as you continue to read, your impatience and annoyance at these “dumb dumbs” turns into endearment! They are loveable idiots and in a way, haven’t we all fell into the “idiotic” category at one or more times in our lives? Trust me I’m definitely guilty of this 🫣Anxious people is definitely a character driven book and a study into how people behave in a distressing situation. We get a look into the background and life story of the 8 individuals, showing how it’s shaped them to the human beings they are today. I really enjoyed this book and I’m obsessed with the authors writing style. This is the second book of his I’ve read and he truly knows how to bring all my emotions out. I went from rolling my eyes, laughing out loud, holding back tears, shouting out loud, then doing it all over again in rotation. 🤣I can’t wait to get through this man’s entire backlist! When it comes to movie/tv series adaptions of books. I’ve always been the “the book is always better” person. But excuse me as I run to Netflix to watch the adaptation of this book just so I can get another dose of these brilliant characters ☺️4.5 ⭐️"

Não estava à espera de gostar tanto, pensava que esta ia ser uma leitura leve, sem muitas pretensões e que ia ser mais um livro. Oh, como estava enganada!Todas as personagens são pessoas normais, ao mesmo tempo que também são um bocadinho malucas (são os piores reféns e o pior ladrão de bancos de sempre, mas são também os melhores reféns e o melhor ladrão de sempre), e todas têm os seus próprios anseios e traumas.Com um humor bastante característico, Fredrik Backman apresenta-nos algumas reflexões sobre a vida, a sociedade e as relações no geral. Sublinhei muito, muuuuuito mesmo este livro, todas as reflexões foram interessantes para mim.Estamos todos muito ansiosos, todos temos os nossos problemas e a vida não pára para ninguém. Por isso, acabamos por nos identificar com uma ou outra personagem, com certas atitudes o que ajuda a gostar AINDA MAIS do livro.""Às vezes entramos em pânico porque é preciso pagar as contas e temos de ser adultos e não sabemos bem como, porque é com uma facilidade horrível e assustadora que se fracassa nisso de ser adulto.""""Gente Ansiosa"" foi uma montanha russa de sentimentos, numa página estava a gargalhar, na outra já estava de lágrimas de olhos.É um livro sensacional, que faz pensar, rir e chorar...

I think this is the reason I like reading Fredrick Backman, whenever I finish his books I want to be a better person for myself and those around me. In  Anxious People  we meet…well… some Anxious People, but they are all anxious for different reasons, because they are adults who just need extra care. We meet a bank robber who is so desperate for money they went to rob a bank, only to find out it is a cashless bank. Not knowing what to do next they run towards a building and ends up at an apartment viewing with some very quirky characters who they unintentionally take hostage. No one walks into an apartment viewing the day before New Year’s Day and expect to be held hostage. Then again, why are you having an apartment viewing New Year’s Eve… but here we are. A group of mismatched people all viewing an apartment who ends up being held hostages. With the building surrounded and no where to go the Robber weighs the choices, go outside and face the consequences or stay inside and try to manage these Anxious People.I was utterly enamoured by this book. Backman KNOWS how to write convincing characters who are filled with heart who you cannot help but root for. I felt my heart warmed the entire time I was reading this book. I think the key take away message from this book is to be kind to everyone you meet because they are fighting a battle. Backman’s ability to let us see the humanity in others, to forgive others and to love others is truly heart-warming and why I will always pick up his book.

You see, this is the sort of book you need to read with no preconceived ideas or spoilers....not because it gives the plot away, but just because it's so much better to have it all be a surprise. So, I'm going to review this book carefully.....and I'm not telling you anything about the plot.Fredrik Backman never ceases to amaze me. The first book I read by Backman was Beartown. Then I figured the second book, Us Against You, couldn't possibly be as good....but it was. Then I read A Man Called Ove. I was prepared to be disappointed...but I loved that one too. When I read the blurb about Anxious People I really expected to find the plot annoying and tedious, but I remembered my surprise at the Beartown series and Ove....so I decided to chance it.Glad I did. This book mixes deep emotions and humor....seriousness and comedy. Backman does it flawlessly. This was an emotional mind trip! And at the end, I wasn't sure if I should cry, laugh or just smile. Great book! With all the mess going on in 2020, I really needed this book. I need to listen to the audio book next...because this book deserves a second read. Another book I loved from Fredrik Backman! No more doubting him.....if he writes a book on car stereo installation I will read it with no second thoughts. I can't wait to see what he comes out with next!See? I reviewed it without giving anything away! :) Yay me!**I voluntarily read a review copy of this book from Atria Books.

This book is so so good, the writing is excellent and the author is super witty and he keeps playing mind tricks with you throughout the book, will lead you into believing something else and will flip it 180, just to call you out! And I loved every bit of it! When you're reading this book, it'll always keep you intrigued and amused, that's what it did to me.The story starts with a bank robbery gone wrong, which leads to the bank robber entering an apartment viewing and taking the viewers as hostages. Then we get small glimpses into each of our hostage's lives and some background characters as well. Reading about them felt as if, the author is creating a bouquet for you, picking each flower with careful thought, each different yet same in their essence, and eventually pairing them all up to create a magnificent bouquet ❤️ In the beginning, these characters were annoying to me, yet amusing, but as we moved along with the story, each of them made a special place in my heart and I grew to love them all with everything I have. Even the policemen.This book is funny, heartwarming, tear-jerking, amusing, intriguing, and much more. It's difficult to put it in just 1 category. It's a masterpiece!

It's funny, sad, clever, even philosophical at times. There was never a point where I wanted to put the book down, never a character I wasn't not interested in reading about. Everything was so well thought out and so well tied together it's without a doubt my favorite book of 2020... so far. But at the same time, did I expect anything else?So many funny quotes and moments where you just have to stop and think for a bit. Even with the simple concept of annoying hostages and a missing bank robber, it never failed to be enticing and interesting. Even at times where we spend 50 pages with therapists and with women in closets talking about parenthood, I never wanted it to end!It's weird because unlike a lot of reviewers, I find it a lot more difficult to talk about books that I love instead of books that I hate.

A really horrible bank robber (but not a really horrible person) flees into a nearby apartment to hide. There happens to be a showing for this apartment as it’s for sale. The bank robber takes the people their “hostage” and the story unfolds. Jim and Jack are the police officers on this case. Small town cops, not like those fancy “Stockholmers” but they are determined to get to the bottom of this situation. Fredrik Backman will go back in forth between the time period after the hostage situation and during the hostages time in the apartment together to weave his characters into your heart. They are connected to each other in many different ways - just like all of us are connected. “This is a story about a bank robber, an apartment viewing, and a hostage drama.

Folk med ångest kommer definitivt att vara en av de bästa, om inte den bästa, boken jag läst i år. Jag fattar inte hur Backman lyckas leva upp till mina skyhöga förväntningar. Det är liksom till och med bättre än mina vildaste drömmar. Jag har så mycket beröm att jag inte vet var jag ska börja. Språket är fantastiskt vackert, poetiskt utan att vara pretentiöst. Om jag hade läst med en penna i handen hade jag nog markerat typ hälften av all text. Det är också så många kloka formuleringar, om samhället, om människor, om kärlek, föräldraskap, ångest. Backman måste vara en helt fantastisk person som kommer på allt utan att det känns klyschigt. Och samtidigt som vi har allt det här med allvarlig och sorglig underton så lyckas Backman samtidigt vara hysteriskt rolig. Jag fattar inte. Mind blown. Jag har ingen aning om hur jag ska bege mig in på att beskriva handlingen så jag tänker inte göra det. Jag tror att det är bäst att gå in utan att veta för mycket. Rekommenderar varmt. "

A father and son, who work together in law enforcement, try to figure out what happened to the bank robber, who has mysteriously disappeared. Truly, though, the topic is conveyed in its title – it is about anxious people, and also about depressed people, suicidal people, and those that think they are not “good enough” or worthy of being loved. It is hard to explain this book without spoilers. It is like a big puzzle that is gradually assembled, all coming together at the end.Backman takes serious topics and examines them through the lens of an absurd situation. It is a very unusual mix of elements, but somehow, he pulls it off. The characters are quirky, each expressing one or more insecurities. Backman uses humor to illuminate human frailties. I felt empathy for these people. I chuckled a number of times at the author’s wry observations on our society.

Κάποιοι λένε πως ένα καλό μυθιστόρημα πρέπει να έχει δυνατή πλοκή, άλλοι υποστηρίζουν πως ο συγγραφέας πρέπει να δημιουργήσει ενδιαφέροντες ήρωες, άλλοι πιστεύουν πως ο τρόπος γραφής είναι το πιο σημαντικό. Ο Backman τα καταφέρνει όλα: ενδιαφέρουσα πλοκή, αξέχαστοι ήρωες κι ένας τρόπος γραφής που μιλάει κατευθείαν στην καρδιά. Το συγκεκριμένο βιβλίο είναι σαν το νερό που βράζει σε μια κατσαρόλα. Στην αρχή ζεσταίνεται, έπειτα κοχλάζει, βγάζει ατμούς και στο τέλος έχει τη σωστή θερμοκρασία κι είναι έτοιμο καυτό για να ρίξεις τα μακαρόνια. Κλείνοντας το βιβλίο ήθελα αμέσως να το διηγηθώ σε κάποιον. Είναι όμως τόσο δύσκολο να περιγράψεις τι συμβαίνει σε αυτό το βιβλίο (σε όλα του τα βιβλία) γιατί δεν μπορείς να μεταφέρεις τη μαγεία.

This book and its plot are not supposed to make sense- Backman even states at the beginning that this book is about idiots and idiotic happenings. There are several heartwarming moments throughout the book, and upon finishing it you'll most likely reflect on how to be more empathetic because everyone has a story they are not sharing. I quite enjoyed the overlap of humor and human reflection in the characters as well. Backman writes conversationally and to the audience, making it seem almost as if we the reader were another character looking into the story. The quick paced nature of the plot and twists and turns will make you want to finish in one sitting! -Hanna G."

242,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16907451-erin-clemence,Rating 5 out of 5,"“Anxious People” is the newest novel by author Fredrik Backman, of “A Man Called Ove” and “Beartown”.  A seemingly normal open house, on the day before New Year’s Eve, is anything but ordinary when a bank robber (who had failed to rob a cash-less bank across the street) ends up holding the participants hostage. The hostages include two married couples who are vying for the apartment, an eighty-year-old woman, a man in a bunny suit and a seemingly uptight bank manager. As the police descend the bank robber must decide how far the hostage situation will go, and who, if only, of the hostages will be released. “People” is character driven, emotionally charged and poignant  (like all of Backman’s other novels)  while still managing to be downright hilarious and heartbreaking all at once. There is not an unlikable character in the bunch, and as they bond over their circumstances, each and every one reveals their vulnerabilities, and shows their human side. “People” has something for everyone, and there is at least one character that each and every reader will align with.Backman shines on a light on readers’ expectations and inner prejudices, as the bank robber is revealed to be someone completely unexpected. As only Backman can do, “People” also portrays the positive and caring side of humanity, even in dire circumstances. The short chapters make this novel easy to read and it is narrated almost completely in the third person. I was invested in each of the characters’ plot lines, and appreciated Backman’s unrealistic but completely cheerful ending. I am a huge fan of Backman’s work, and have been waiting on this one for a long time. A page-turning, hilarious plot with a big, fat dose of humanity is absolutely everything I wanted, and more. "

So why do I feel like it wasn't everything I wanted it to be? I guess I assumed this book would be more serious than I thought it would be, so maybe my feelings are just on me and what I expected. The writing is great, the characters are super weird and quirky and their dialogue us to die for (seriously, they're hilarious), but I just can't shake the fact that I was missing something the entire time. At the end of the day, it's a story about a parent and the lengths they will go to for their children. It's a story about understanding each other's difficulties in life, or choices. What's right and wrong. Love (self-love, acceptance, etc). Despite all these great things, I just didn't feel like I got as much as I wanted out of it). Maybe because I'm not a parent? I've read A Man Called Ove and Beartown by Backman before, and I loved the heartfelt characters and their stories. Compared to Anxious People, this new one just kind of felt a little disjointed between each chapter, from the way past and present interspersed to the witness interviews. It just wasn't as cohesive, or as clean of a transition that I personally enjoy. We jumped from one part to another, then went back halfway in-between the last chapter to find out more things. But like I said, this book is definitely really funny, and I did enjoy my time reading it. I just felt like I wasn't as connected to the story like I usually expect from Backman, so that did upset me a little. I know many people are loving this though, and I'm glad for all the 5 star reviews it gets!Ultimately, this book is about understanding yourself and others, and it is a book to keep on your radar and read. Whether this is your first book by him or not, I do think there's lots to be enjoyed about it!"
244,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7912849-kerrin,Rating 4 out of 5,"Since I normally enjoy Fredrik Backman’s quirky writing style, I was looking forward to reading his new release Anxious People. For the first part of the story, I wanted to rename the book Obnoxious People. Other than the two police officers, I didn’t like any of the characters. I wasn’t getting the “comical nature” of the book. Then about half-way through, the somewhat unreliable narrator gave a plot twist that changed the direction of the story. Afterward, I started to enjoy this convoluted tale more.In a small Swedish town, a bank robber attempts to rob a bank (but only for enough money to pay rent), but the bank is cashless and the robber gets no money. The bank robber runs across the street and stumbles into an apartment viewing. The bank robber locks the door and holds the people at the viewing hostage. Eventually, the bank robber frees the hostages. When the police enter the apartment, the bank robber has vanished into thin air.The novel starts with the hostages being interviewed by a young police officer, whose father is also his partner. The interviews are all quite difficult, and the witnesses seem like total idiots. Gradually, we learn the backstories of the bank robber, the hostages, the police officers, and also the psychologist of one of the hostages and the bank teller. These honest stories of ordinary, anxious people are the heart of the novel. Each of them asks themselves “What is love?” and “What would you be willing to do for love?”. Once the mystery of the disappeared bank robber is solved, the novel then provides the reader with the happily ever after stories of the characters.3.5-Stars rounded up to 4-Stars."

The answer is: Stockholm! ;)There is a bank robbery followed by a hostage situation. At least that is what the cops are calling it. In reality, the attempts were both so ridiculously botched that the only actual crime is how bad the perpetrator is at committing crimes. *lol*The hostage situation takes place at an apartment where prospectors meet. And boy, is that an idiotic bunch. *loool*Yes, the set-up is a bit of a far stretch but it’s still a nice frame for this story of failed marriages, the ruthlessness of banks ruining people, custody battles, various problems in various relationships etc. And then there is the son-and-father police team. *snickers*The topics addressed in this book can be quite dark (suicide) but the author knows that that is the perfect reason why to write this book in the hilarious way that he did. The „mystery“ isn’t actually one, I figured it out about 10% into the story but I think that was done on purpose - the less time readers spend trying to figure out a mystery, the more time they can spend with the characters and their problems.Honestly, this might not appear - at first glance - to be as profound as other books by the author, but boy, does it pack a number of punches. Not one big punch, but several smaller ones that don’t hurt any less.And yet, I laughed myself silly while reading this, just as the author intended, I’m sure. While simultaneously my heart broke a time or two.Therefore, this might be one of the more underrated books by this author, but it’s still brilliant."

Η αλήθεια είναι ότι με βάση τη βαθμολογία του βιβλίου στο Goodreads, αλλά και με διάφορα σχόλια αριστερά και δεξιά, είχα αρκετά υψηλές προσδοκίες, οπότε περίμενα κάτι που πραγματικά θα με εντυπωσιάσει, όμως απλώς πέρασα καλά. Ναι, καταλαβαίνω απόλυτα αυτούς που λατρεύουν τα βιβλία του Μπάκμαν: Δημιουργεί αξιοπερίεργους χαρακτήρες, έχει ωραίο και ιδιαίτερο χιούμορ, αγγίζει με τον δικό του ξεχωριστό τρόπο διάφορα κοινωνικά ζητήματα, ενώ σε κάνει να γελάς, να δακρύζεις (αν είσαι λίγο ευαίσθητος) και να σκέφτεσαι για τη ζωή σου και τους ανθρώπους γύρω σου, ενώ στο τέλος νιώθεις μάλλον αναζωογονημένος. Ναι, μου άρεσε το βιβλίο, έστω και αν σε κάποια σημεία η πλοκή έκανε κοιλίτσα και με έχανε λίγο. Χαίρομαι πολύ που το διάβασα -ειδικά αυτή την περίοδο-, γέλασα αρκετά και ένιωσα ποικίλα συναισθήματα. Και δέθηκα αρκετά με τους χαρακτήρες, όσο κουλοί κι αν ήταν. Και δεν πειράζει που δεν θα του βάλω πέντε αστεράκια. Το μόνο σίγουρο είναι ότι θα υπάρξει μέλλον με τον συγγραφέα (και όχι μόνο με το ένα βιβλίο που έχω στα αδιάβαστα)."

E minunat scrisă, iar personajele sunt delicioase. Suntem atât de obișnuiți să putem etichete, să ne dăm cu părerea, să îi judecăm pe cei din jur, încât de cele mai multe ori, ne izolam în propria noastră lume imaginară.“Suntem doar străini care trec unul pe lângă celălat, iar anxietatea ta o atinge în treacăt pe a mea când fibrele hainelor noastre se încurcă și se descurcă preț de-o clipă în aglomerația de pe trotuar.

Seeing one shared event and how it is changing the course of eight lives at once eventually brought them all together.  A truly wonderful novel about a crime that happened, a would-be bank robber who disappears and others. It caught my attention. I became deeply concerned in the life of these people. It is written inusual prose but it works. Each of them are full of baggage like hurts, pain, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. The book is creatively constructed about friends, forgiveness, and hope in the most anxious situations.I recommend people to read this book."

A jednak strony książki leciały jak szalone (3:30 nad ranem kiedy to piszę), a ja odkryłam, że ich lubię. Nadal mnie irytują, a ich dziwne nawyki, zwyczaje i irracjonalne zachowania frustrują, ale są tak realistycznie i ludzko wykreowani, że nie da się im nie kibicować. I uśmiechać się z czułością, może odrobiną politowania.Książka napisana jest niesamowicie lekko, z fantastycznym humorem, nie popada jednak w głupotki. Wręcz przeciwnie, Backman z wyczuciem pisze o zdrowiu psychicznym, zarówno o wielkich kryzysach, jak i codziennych zmaganiach, w niektórych miejscach uderzając tam, gdzie najbardziej boli, w innych otaczając ciepłym kocykiem zrozumienia. Bo w końcu każdy z nas czasami (a może częściej niż czasami) sobie zwyczajnie nie radzi. Nie jesteśmy sami."

252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44095345-carmel-hanes,Rating 4 out of 5,"I like Backman, almost everything I've read that he's written. Some more than others, but all have been well-written and interesting. This one took me back to my initial exposure to him in A Man Called Ove, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Humorous, but also touching and apt in terms of the foibles of humanity. Anxious People gives us a bank robbery gone bad. Or good, as the case may be. The bank robber ends up with a motley assortment of uncooperative people, in a farcical rendition of how not to take hostages. Or who not to take hostage. The telling is purposefully confusing and a bit disjointed, moving back and forth in time, with teasers along the way. But it all comes together in the end, and the journey is strewn with little gems that are signature Backman, both the humorous and the apropos:""No one goes to see a psychologist to talk about all the times they weren't hit in the head by a swing as a child. Parents are defined by their mistakes.""""Not that this is in any way a defense of bank robbers, but they can have bad days at work, too. Hand on heart, which of us hasn't wanted to pull a gun after talking to a twenty-year-old?""And vintage Backman:""There are simply some things that all normal people understand that you must never under any circumstances do. You mustn't tell lies, you mustn't steal, you mustn't kill, and you mustn't throw stones at birds. we all agree on that.Except maybe swans, because swans can actually be passive-aggressive little bastards. But apart from swans, you mustn't throw stones at birds. And you mustn't tell lies. Unless...well, sometimes you have to, of course, like when your children ask: ""Why does it smell like chocolate in here?.....But you must never kill people. Well, unless they're Hitler. You're allowed to kill Hitler.""Backman can create a sense of someone and an indictment with a single sentence: ""...a woman called Zara. She's somewhere in her fifties, and beautifully dressed in that way that people who have become financially independent on the back of other people's financial dependency often are.""Backman makes me smile, and laugh out loud, and feel all warm and fuzzy inside. And that is just what I needed after some stressful weeks of life. He may shine a light on some of the ugly parts of life, but he does it in such a way that we can stand to look, and even feel good afterwards, as though it was wrapped in invisible hope all along."
253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2195363-leslie,Rating 5 out of 5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5 Stars ""They say that a person’s personality is the sum of their experiences. But that isn’t true, at least not entirely, because if our past was all that defined us, we’d never be able to put up with ourselves. We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows."" 

As with any Fredrik Backman book I've read since Beartown, I thought of Liz as I read this. It's been three years since she's been gone. I'll always treasure the memory of meeting her while meeting him. (I’m the one on the left!) For me, connecting with people about books is a special kind of magic. If you'd like to know more about that story, you can find it in my review of, ""Beartown."" I'm sorry, I haven't figured out how to post links to reviews yet.This book was beautiful. I felt it down to my core. On the surface, it's about a bank robber, hostages and police men. But like most Backman books, it's an iceberg. Those are merely the details we see going in. What's underneath is huge. It's messy and complicated, tangled and layered. It scratched and ripped at my heart until it was to the point of breaking. Then soothed and healed it. 🥰I think this is one of those books where it's best to go in blind. I will say that it took me a while to get into it but once I did, I simply couldn't put it down. Ultimately, it's a love story. More than one story. A collection of them woven into one book. And can't we all use a little extra love right now? 😘 “Your mom was right, the ones who make you laugh last a lifetime,” Estelle repeated, thinking of a British author who had written that nothing in the world is so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. Then she thought about an American author who had written that loneliness is like starvation, you don’t realize how hungry you are until you begin to eat. "
254,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126347706-zo,Rating 4 out of 5,"Fredrik Backman is my kind of author. Am I saying this after only reading two of his novels? Yes. Am I sure I’ll love anything he writes, simply because he wrote it? Also yes. Anxious People manages to be both intricately crafted and simplistically beautiful; the detailed connections between all of the characters leading to shared themes of life, love, and how hard it can be to push through another day (you know, all the important stuff). I swear Backman has to have lived multiple lives at this point with how empathetic and all-encompassing his writing is, and I doubt I’ll ever not be blown away by it.Out of all the idiots (iykyk) in the book, I’d have to say that Zara’s story was my favorite. Seeing her evolve as a person throughout the novel was such a touching experience and I admit, tears were definitely shed… she would hate that, wouldn’t she. Oh well; give me a proud, stuck up female character who’s carrying a burden of guilt from a tragic backstory and has to learn the art of vulnerability, and I will love her forever and ever!!Becoming immersed in this novel was a wonderful experience all around; from the unpredictable plot and unforgettable characters, to the plot lines converging and the satisfaction of everything falling into place by the end. Was it sometimes a little cringy? Possibly. Almost too sugary sweet? Yes. A bit unrealistic? Absolutely. Yet still, I absolutely adored it. If you haven’t read anything by Fredrik Backman before, what are you even doing?? This is your sign!!!"
255,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3660666-bethany-beautifully-bookish-bethany,Rating 1 out of 5,"Reading Vlog: https://youtu.be/L_uUIXktxSQActual rating: 1.5 starsMaybe an unpopular opinion but I wasn't a big fan of this. It was my first time trying Backman and I'd heard rave reviews about his characters in particular, so I'm wondering if Anxious People is typical of his writing. For about the first 2/3 of the book all of the characters were incredibly annoying and depicted in over the top ways that didn't feel like real people at all. Then at the end the way they are written suddenly has humanity and nuance, but it feels like an emotionally manipulative tactic to try to make the topics of the book (grief, loss, loneliness, suicidal ideation etc) hit harder. And I don't like that. There were a few moments I appreciated, talking about love in a long term marriage for instance. But there was also a lot of faux deep philosophizing, as if experiences the author (I assume) has had are universal when they aren't. And trying too hard to be clever in ways that didn't hit for me. Plus the ending wraps up far too neatly and doesn't reflect the messiness of humanity or the complexity of the world we actually live in. It feels kind of trite and trying to manipulate a sense of emotional catharsis.So if you've read other books by this author I would be interested to know if this book is reflective of his typical work. Because if it is, he just might not be my cup of tea. The audio narrator was great though. Thank you to Libro.FM for the review copy. All opinions are my own."

I just don't think my vocabulary is equipped enough to describe the depth of this book but I promised myself that I'll try to talk out about my reading experience. To begin with, it has layers and layers of stories, that I think the author himself was unsure of how to connect and bridge it into a single piece, blending the characters together into the said-apartment viewing-turned-robbery scenario. But clever as he is, you'll find yourself immersed into a sitcom-like setting where the characters blurt out of their minds and the stories collide revealing exciting new stories. Each story, fresh and offering new surprises!I know you'll think I'm just blabbering in the name of book Review but that's exactly how this book is. It's really hard to categorise it into a specific genre. There are heartwarming people, who did stupid things for the people who they loved, unusual decisions that'd change their lives forever. There's a romance somewhere which comes out as a complete sweet surprise. Well, I can go on and on about Anxious People but that will only make me an anxious person myself! Lol.Read it for yourself, I'd say. It's lighthearted, fun and really relaxing. Perhaps an escapism you'd need from the current scenario. I'd thank the publisher for my advanced proof. All opinions are certainly mine."

This has been my first Backman and I find it extremely hard to rate this novel because my expectations were not met at all but in the end, I quite liked some of the characters but still think that the plot is overly constructed. Maybe that’s just how his novels are and I should have done a bit of research beforehand, I don’t know.What I know is that I don’t like stories in which characters behave like not one single person in real life would behave. That’s the reason why I cannot rate this book with five stars. A masked and armed person storms into an apartment full of potential buyers and tells them that they are taken hostage, most of them just laugh, tell the perpetrator that the gun looks fake and just none of them is scared or takes the situation seriously. Who would behave like that?! "

This novel is all of that and more, and longtime fans and new ones will be delighted to own this book in September 2020. I won't say more about the plot because it's so much fun to go in blind and just experience it.I can't wait for everyone to read it.Journalists, bloggers, instagrammers, reading pals - you know where to find me. :)"

A bank robber is trying to steal money from a bank, he retreats to an apartment where he takes hostage 8 people. All 8 has different stories and personalities and while during the hostage you find out about each of character and the bank robber as well. The Father/son police officers try to find the bank robbers through each hostage but have trouble doing so. So were did the robber go? Did the hostages help? I loved this story. Each person in the story is different and so much fun to get to know. There is an underlying theme in the book. There is a bridge and 2 people tried to kill themselves on it. one lived the other died. The person who was there both time was the son police officer. Through the book you are shown why you should never be on that bridge. I laughed and cried and just had so much fun reading this wonderful book. I love Fredrik Backman.

I’ve heard so many good things about his writing and this story didn’t disappoint. It brought out all the feels. I will say that at first, I was a bit confused about the story and where it was going. The police interviews and the cadence drove me a bit nuts, so I warn if you pick this up, hang on and have a bit of patience because it all comes together beautifully! It’s a story about an attempted bank robbery, an accidental hostage situation, but at the core it’s about love and how our actions impact others. The story is quirky, fun, and inspirational. I did shed a few tears by the end!I listened to the audio and while Marin Ireland’s performance was good, I was a little disappointed that she didn’t have a Swedish accent.

It is one of the most beautiful books that I have ever read, and I recommend it with my entire soul. It's a comedy (while also making me cry so much I couldn't breathe) about a bank robbery that never took place and instead became a hostage situation. It's the story of the 8 people stuck in the room and the 2 police officers that are trying to save them. My favourite thing about it, is that everyone in the room is so different: There's an 80 year old woman, a really poor and really rich person, a couple that has been married for 30+ years and a newly married couple. And so you would think that they have nothing in common, and yet...It's such an honest story about life, and love and everything beautiful about this world. Please pick it up, you won't regret it ❤️"

No...I found myself a bit annoyed by the mystery and the timeline jumps for the sake of confusing the reader, but Backman has such a distinct writing style, even with my small issues, I still found myself completely absorbed in this one."

Friends have been slacking in their recommendations because this book was amazing! Not sure I'd categorize it as Humor but it did have some laugh out loud moments. Two words - Rabbit Crapper. How to describe this book? Fredrik Backman tells us that it is a story about many things but mostly, idiots. He also tells us that we are all doing the best we can and one of my key takeaways was if we all took a moment to listen to each other, there would be less idiocy.This aptly titled book explores how complicated and messy life can be and that everyone is interconnected as human beings. On the surface, this story is about an Open House that is interrupted by a criminal trying to flee the scene of a botched bank robbery, but there are hidden depths to each character that are slowly revealed to the reader. Even a few twists along the way. The message of - we are all fellow travelers in this thing called everyday life - stays with you. Perfect read for the year that was 2020. This book was a very emotional and yet, quick read with some passages hitting harder than others. When the man on the bridge tells Jack, ""Do you know what the worst thing about being a parent is? That you're always judged by your worst moment."" I felt that in my gut. Or, ""...your anxieties briefly brushed against mine as the fibers of our coats touch momentarily on a crowded sidewalk somewhere. We never really know what we do to each other..."" And, ""It just hurts so much at times, being human. Not understanding yourself, not liking the body you're stuck in."" Despite these somewhat heavy passages, the story flows and is a quick read. It has an uplifting message and will make me all the more thankful this holiday season. Best part? Backman knows how to write and his words carry an emotional punch without knocking you out. I will be reading ALL of his other books."

""Anxious People"" ou ""Gente Ansiosa"" como ficou cá conhecido em Portugal, vem-nos dar a conhecer não uma, mas várias histórias de idiotas.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣Porque é disso que isto se trata, de uma história cheia de idiotas. O livro come��a com uma má ideia que partiu de um idiota que acabou por envolver mais idiotas. Foi um detalhe que me cativou logo desde início. O próprio autor dá entender que iremos conhecer personagens com problemas reais, que vão ser considerados completos idiotas, mas que no final são idiotas com histórias para partilhar e muito para ensinar.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣A narrativa pode parecer lenta. Há capítulos que parece que a história não avança, mas assim que começámos a entender o que realmente se passa voámos pela leitura. E eis aqui que tenho de bater palmas a Fredrik Backman, a sua escrita é tão cativante, o leitor acaba preso à história de uma maneira tão profunda. Senti estar lá junto das personagens a viver esta história de idiotas.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣Terminar esta leitura sem sentir um aperto no peito é complicado. O livro todo acaba por ser pesado, falámos de temas muito duros, sendo o tema principal suicídio e no meu ponto de vista ansiedade. Personagens reais, com problemas reais. Não criar empatia pelas personagens é tarefa complicada.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣Sem sombra de dúvida alguma que recomendo a leitura de ""Gente Ansiosa"". Antes de lerem recomendo que observem os trigger warnings que são imensos, mas leiam. Vale mesmo a pena ficar a conhecer esta história de idiotas.⁣⁣⁣"
274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6450088-tania,Rating 4 out of 5,"""One single really bad idea. That's all it takes.3.5 stars. I almost gave up on this book after the first two chapters, it felt exaggerated and absurd. But seeing that I find it almost impossible to stop reading I pushed on, and I'm so glad I did. I especially enjoyed the chapters about Zara, and thought Lennart and Ro was such sweet people.Yes, sometimes this author's plotlines and characters verges on the ridiculous but he balances it perfectly with his insightful and compassionate descriptions of human behavior. He has the ability to write a sentence that makes you stop and think, I knew that but have never thought of it before... In other words to make you think about things that you've just always accepted before and never really considered before. I laughed out loud quite a few times towards the end, even though the subject matter covered in this book is mostly sad and that also takes some talent. So, if you are not immediately sold on the story, I urge you to carry on reading as it will be worth your while in the end."

Gente ansiosa, gente imperfeita, gente, acima de tudo, real. Porque todos nós, no fundo, somos um pouco idiotas. Todos nós já tomámos decisões de que nos arrependemos, todos nós já cometemos erros e fizemos disparates quando tínhamos a mais nobre das intenções e todos nós já tivemos dias maus. E Backman explora isso mesmo, com a qualidade e a humanidade na construção de personagens a que, de resto, já nos habituou."

279,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon-darth-anyan,Rating 3 out of 5," And then things went the way they did: the police surrounded the building, reporters showed up, the story made it onto the television news. The whole thing went on for several hours, until the bank robber had to give up. There was no other choice. This is one of the novels I saved for the Holiday Season of 2020, based on my positive impressions from previous Backman stories, in particular “A Man Called Ove”.Indeed, it is that sort of story, about people coming together and working on their troubles through sharing the burden. And it is set up on New Year’s Eve, in a fictional Scandinavian small town. Backman remains true to his artistic forms of expression, already established with several bestsellers. Yet, the reading experience was more ‘miss’ than ‘hit’ for me, probably due to a case of ‘too much of a good thing’ , an emotional overload driven by relentless editorial comments, which come on every single page, from every single character, at the drop of the metaphorical hat. Back when I first met Ove, that suicidal, cantankerous old man that somehow still loves life and his neighbours, Backman’s style was fresh and endearing. After four or five novels that basically re-apply the successful formula, the magic has grown stale. I still believe Backman is a talented storyteller, capable of a beautiful turn of phrase and in general treating his characters with kindness and tenderness. Our lives are bars of soap that we keep losing hold of; the moment we relax, they drift off and fall in love and get broken, all in the wink of an eye. But I am persuaded, after this novel and “Beartown”, that he has the subtlety of a sledgehammer, more concerned with driving his point across to the readers than with letting them decide for themselves what to think about the given situations. “I think it’s wonderful, I really do, that people are free to love whoever they like nowadays.”“I’d like to make it absolutely clear that I share that view.” Another aspect of the style that made me initially a Backman fanboy was the humour, his ability to find space for a chuckle, a word play or a comical misunderstanding in character interactions. It’s still present, albeit in a rather contrived, forced manner, just like those page-long editorial inserts and the repetitions of key phrases that serve as a signature move for the author. The whole novel has a theatrical vibe, with a staged setting and people assigned predetermined roles that cover the subjects the author wants debated. The plot in particular feels unnatural, forced and highly improbable, riddled with coincidences and secret links between characters. I believe this is deliberate, not necessarily a failure on the part of the storyteller: People need fairy tales as well, not just narrative. Given the nature of the plot, it is almost impossible to talk about it beyond the initial stage setup of a bank robbery gone wrong and of the following hostage situation that puts several ‘anxious’ people in close proximity to each other.Basically, Backman tries to rewrite one of Frank Capra’s movies about small town communities coming together over Christmas or New Year. For inspiration he goes to such sources as “Dog Day Afternoon” for the anti-establishment angle and “A Long Way Down” for the suicidal anxiety angle. (Personally, I very much prefer Nick Hornby’s type of humor and his more subtle delivery over Backman. So I actually started “Just Like You” right after finishing “Anxious People”)The project is in general successful, with Backman able to drive home both the economic distress of modern life and the alienation of people of high sensibility who are pushed to the brink of the abyss by the system. I finally gave the novel a three star rating, which I consider a positive, because I don’t want to let my own disappointment with the cringeworthy humour and the artificial setting distract potential readers from the true strengths of Backman’s storytelling. She was beautiful, I wasn’t. She could dance, I could barely move my feet. Back when we first met, the way we thought about our work was probably all we had in common. The fact that we save those we can. Will I read another book from the same author in the future? Right now, I don’t feel any urge to continue, even as I look at the already acquired sequel to ‘Beartown’ . But I find some hope in a flash of self-awareness and in the ability to make fun of his own idiosyncrasies in a repartee like this: “Do you know what, [Mr. Backman]? Maybe you could get a new job writing mottos for fortune cookies?” She smiles. I smile myself, and hope for a better year to come."

De câte ori, la rândul nostru, nu ne-am ascuns trăirile interioare, ca să nu părem slabi în fața celorlați? De câte ori ne-au dictat acele trăiri comportamentul? De câte ori sufeream, dar încercam să afișăm un zâmbet/o atitudine superioară? De câte ori am încercat să facem ceea ce se presupune că trebuie să facem, în loc de ceea ce ne îndeamnă sufletul? De câte ori nu ne-am sacrificat pentru binele persoanelor dragi? De câte ori i-am văzut pe apropiații noștri suferind, neștiind ce să facem să îi ajută? - câteva din întrebările pe care mi le-am pus pe parcursul acestei lecturi.🐰Îl tot văzusem pe domnul Backman de ceva timp, dar vă zic sincer că în prima fază eu am crezut că este o carte de dezvoltare personală (bineînțeles, fără să fi citit descrierea sau să mă interesez de ea). Așa că am zis pas.🤭 Până când a fost un “BUM” pe bookstagram și toată lumea a început să îi cumpere cărțile, să le citească, să vorbească de ele încât nu trecea o zi în care să nu fi văzut vreo carte de la el. Că era “Oameni anxioși”, “Un bărbat pe nume Ove” sau “Bunica mi-a zis să-ți spun că îi pare rău”, nu conta. Așa că am început să fiu și eu curioasă în legătură cu Fredrik Backman. Momentul decisiv a fost când a citit @booksstopia “Oameni anxioși” și văzându-i trăirile intense mi-am spus că trebuie și eu să citesc această carte neapărat.🐰Am luat-o fără să știu prea multe despre ea. Nu știam despre ce ar trebui să fie, în ce gen se încadrează, nimic, nimic. Și bine am făcut! Surpriza a fost cu atât mai mare când am început să citesc și în primele pagini deja eram cu zâmbetul pe buze, râdeam și eram uimită de stilul atât de fluid și de călduros al autorului.🤩🐰Backman mi se pare genul de autor pe care nu îl poți descrie neapărat. Sau nu cum se cuvine. Ca în cazul lui Laini Taylor (fantasy), you just have to try it on your own. Cu toate acestea, sincer vă zic, nu cred că ar putea afirma cineva că este un autor care nu știe cum să scrie.🐰Pentru mine Backman este un fel de Caragiale modern, if it makes sense. Nu mă pot pronunța cu privire la celelalte cărți ale lui, dar pe măsură ce citeam, așa am avut impresia. O satiră adusă societății, un “râsu-plânsu”, dar într-un mod muuult mai cald, mai glumeț și mai simpatic decât celebrul clasic.🥸🐰Un aspect care mi-a plăcut enorm au fost personajele. Toate sunt inspirate din viața de zi cu zi și vă promit că cel puțin o dată ați interacționat cu fiecare dintre ele. Foaarte bine construite, foarte ancorate în realitate și foarte...vii. Cu emoții puternice, cu trăiri, cu secretele și fricile care îi ard câte puțin în fiecare zi. Vă regăsiți, nu-i așa?🐰Chiar este un roller coaster de sentimente. Personal, nu am plâns (is it sth wrong with me?🤣), dar vă zic sincer că am fost trup și suflet cu personajele. Am început prin a le ironiza pe toate și prin a-mi da ochii peste cap, la a le îndrăgi și poate cu unele chiar rezona. Nu cred că nu ai cum să nu simți nimic când le citești poveștile și când vezi prin ce trec.🐰Backman nu este genul de autor pe care eu l-aș citi în mod normal, carte după carte, dar țin să subliniez că “Oameni anxioși” este lectura pe care toată lumea trebuie să o citească în viața aceasta. Măcar dați-i o șansă, eu chiar nu cred că o să dezamăgească pe cineva.🥰"
281,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28831526-jean,Rating 5 out of 5,"Idiot. “A stupid person.” Synonyms: fool, halfwit, nincompoop, dunce, dolt, ignoramus. Okay, you get the picture. No one in Fredrik Backman’s outstanding fiction work, Anxious People, is immune from idiotic moments. Ridiculous, inane events had me chuckling early on as a would-be bank robber screwed up and wound up in an apartment full of strangers. These individuals naturally assumed they were being robbed or taken hostage. Who wouldn’t? The perpetrator held a pistol and wore a ski mask. The “robber” appeared flustered, kept apologizing, and asked for quiet and time to think.From the onset, this caper was a major screw-up. Even the policemen in charge, a father-son team named Jim and Jack, couldn’t interview the witnesses effectively and had let the perpetrator slip though their fingers right under their noses. Idiots, right?It’s a story about a bank robbery gone wrong. Right? Wrong. It’s also a story about a bridge. And about ? Huh? I can’t tell you more. There are more surprises, one after another, which on the surface do not make sense. Comical, head-scratching additions that momentarily confused me until the pieces began to connect. This is the beauty of Backman’s writing. He doesn’t lay it all out at once. Rather, he slowly adds details layer by layer.The apartment scenes are interspersed with interviews at the police station. Those are bizarre and frustrating and amusing. Then there are Zara’s therapy sessions. Her therapist appears to struggle with issues of her own, which should surprise no one. All of this adds to the brilliance of Frederik Backman.At the same time, he peels back the masks that hide the insecurities and anxieties that each person feels. Family crises. Divorces. Professional and personal identity questions. Life and death events. At an open house, these strangers become human to one another, to their spouses, and even to themselves. Jim and Jack are not excluded from instances of personal connection aside from their work either. The events of this day and the people they meet remind them that they are not just colleagues. They are father and son.To truly love this book, I feel, one cannot expect a realistic plot or even true-to-life characters. Mr. Backman goes beyond bounds of reality. That’s not to say that this is fantasy; it is not. But he does make the pieces fit just so, and wouldn’t it be nice if that could happen for all of us?I dare say we all have our moments of idiocy, of anxiety. Backman does make a case for those who truly need help, and that is important too. What touched me so much was his ability to demonstrate the power of connection between people. Listen to one another. Be kind. Pay it forward. Enjoy this book.Thank you, Fredrik Backman, for this wonderful gift.5 stars"
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley,Rating 5 out of 5,"May 2022:I still love this. Adding to favorites shelf.January 2021:“They say that a person’s personality is the sum of their experiences. But that isn’t true, at least not entirely, because if our past was all that defined us, we’d never be able to put up with ourselves. We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.”This is my favorite of Backman's books (that I've read) by quite a large margin.I would describe Anxious People as ""whimsical"" and ""playful"" except that would discount the reckoning with human pain and yes, anxiety, that also fills these pages. The truth is that is all of those things, and more! Honestly, all my favorite stories in any medium don't confine themselves to just one genre or tone, but can be incredibly funny and moving and gross and profane and profound and silly and sentimental all in the same text, from one minute to the next. And all of it adds up to something more for me than it would have been as just a ""serious book"" about anxiety and the consequences of bad choices, and what it does to our brains just being human and living our lives.This will be my second book in a row that implores you to go in without really knowing anything beyond a very basic premise, which in this case could be described as ""hapless bank robber accidentally takes hostages"".I predicted several of the twists and reveals, but it was a pleasure to do so. The joy of this book does not depend on the ""reveals"" necessarily being surprises. In fact, for every instance in which I called a reveal, I really wanted that thing to happen, and was so, so happy when it did. I was happy for the characters and just happy in general. The pleasure in this story comes not just from the surprise of a twist well planned that will catch you off guard (there are some of those), but also in your expectations and hopes being met when you've figured it out in advance.My only reservation is that I feel like some phrases and use of individual words may have been lost in translation. That's always a downside of translation, but it was worth noting here, because I kept wondering if the English phrases being used by translator meant something different than they did in the original Swedish. The biggest example is the word  ""idiots,"" which is used many times and in a variety of different ways, almost like a motif, so it wasn't an insignificant thing to wonder if I wasn't quite getting the meaning Backman originally was going for. I'm sure there were also subtleties I missed in Backman's humorous use of ""Stockholm"" in its many variations, because I am not Swedish. Just something I was thinking while reading.I highly recommend this one, maybe even if you haven't liked Backman's other books.[4.5 stars]"

(Ich würde sogar sagen, mir hat es noch besser gefallen als ""Kleine Stadt der großen Träume"")- Die bunt zusammengewürfelte Gruppe bei der Wohnungsbesichtigung ist so schräg und liebenswert. Eine abgefahrene Balance aus echt und überzeichnet. Wie Backman die Figuren in wenigen Strichen zeichnet, zeigt für mich seine unglaubliche Beobachtungsgabe. - Wiederkehrendes Motiv ist, wie anstrengend es eigentlich ist, erwachsen zu sein. Fühlt sich dadurch ziemlich nah an und geht schnell ins Herz bzw. die eigene Erfahrung.- Genau mein Humor! Eine gute Balance aus trockenen Sprüchen und absurden Zwischenfällen. Habe immer wieder gekichert oder laut gelacht.- Der Plot ist großartig. Backman legt immer wieder falsche und richtige Fährten und schiebt entscheidende Infos erst „zu spät“ rüber, sodass man immer wieder überrascht und/oder schockiert wird.- Auch sprachlich wieder ein echter Glückgriff. Ich kann mir richtig vorstellen, wie der Autor an einzelnen Formulierungen ewig feilt, bis sie genau ins Herz treffen.- Boah, was hab ich am Ende aus Rührung geflennt. Ich werde „Eine ganze dumme Idee“ SEHR bald nochmal re-readen und wahrscheinlich sogar mal meine Ausgabe kommentieren, markieren usw.

It’s character driven and predominately about a bank robbery that goes wrong, bumbling police and the worst idiotic, yes idiotic hostages ever!What changed my mind was the way the story was put together, I think I got to a certain point in the plot, many chapters in (you'll see what I mean!) and I had a aha moment and everything clicked and I thoroughly appreciated the remainder of the story. It does have a very clever and impressive twist so hang out if you can!Totally unique, quirky and in the end a satisfying read. Themes of suicide, loneliness and depression."

This book was funny, sad, hopeless, and hopeful all at the same time. It was amazing to see the connections between these strangers who weren't quite strangers arise as the story developed. In the end, I loved all of the characters, even though when I first met some of them they seemed unlikable. Once I got to know their story, I felt so sad for them for the problems they all had because of life. And meeting each other was the best thing that could have happened to all of them.I also have to say that I love Fredrick Backman's writing style. It's humorous, uplifting, and keeps you really engaged in the book. It was hard for me to hold myself back and not read the whole thing in one day!And thank you to my buddy reading partner, both for making the read more enjoyable and for introducing me to this book that I probably wouldn't have read otherwise. 😊"

Do I even have to say anything more? For the past few months I've tried making my way through everything this author writes and he has been successful in surprising me every time. One story after the other, one deep theme at a time, his writing has slowly climbed to the top of my list. I love how he writes nothing other than the daily life of some characters and yet weaves it into an amazing story. His characters are real, every day people, his short tales and anecdotes are just some versions of our lives, his humour has a tinge of deep sadness to it and the emotional aspect has the brightest laugh filled there. It's something unlike anything I've ever read so all I have to say is, if you haven't read Backman yet, do it today.

  This is a story about a bridge, and idiots, and a hostage drama, and an apartment viewing. But it’s also a love story. Several, in fact.
But most of all, this is a love letter to what it means to be alive in the twenty-first century today. It's funny, horrifying, uplifting, depressing, hopeful, terrifying, and everything in between.It takes nine people on the eve of New Year and throws them into an apartment and with that story follows. With that joins more people, more untold stories, more missed opportunities, more regrets, more joy, more failure, more pain, and more laughter. And then it becomes an exploration of every emotion of every human being.We never asked to be born, we never signed up for all these responsibilities, trauma, and lifelong subscription of not knowing anything at all. But here we are. Living a life we don't want, doing the work that we don't like, and losing sleep over things that won't last anyway. We pass day after day with the big lump of nothingness in our throat and we pretend. We pretend we know what we are doing, we pretend it doesn't hurt, we pretend it's okay when the truth is- 
  It just hurts so much at times, being human. Not understanding yourself, not liking the body you’re stuck in. Seeing your eyes in the mirror and wondering whose they are, always with the same question: “What’s wrong with me? Why do I feel like this?”
So, we pretend some more. We visit museums, read books, watch movies and listen to songs. We knock on every door so we can make sense of ourselves. We go into the workforce of life and try to find the meaning in all the heartaches, all the numbness, and all the shattered pieces. So when Zara, one of the many characters from the book said this, it felt like looking into a mirror- 
  ""Your generation don’t want to study a subject, you just want to study yourselves.""
And the more we know ourselves, the more insecurities arrive. We are terrified of failing every second of every day. So we ask ourselves. Again and again, and again-
  ""Am I good? Do I make anyone proud? Am I useful to society? Am I good at my job? Generous and considerate? A decent shag? Does anyone want me to be their friend? Have I been a good parent? Am I a good person?""
Cause deep down we can't really live with knowing we hurt someone, we are bad, we failed. Well, at least most of us can't. And maybe that's why we are more alike than we are ready to admit. Maybe that's why we suffer."
293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108887244-anne,Rating 2 out of 5,"aka: Annoying PeopleI first saw this book on Goodreads Choice Awards 2020. After a wait, the audio book was available to me, which I ditched within the first few chapters because the flip floppy narrative structure wasn’t making sense. I assumed it must be my problem, but the premise was interesting enough to give the Kindle book a go. After another long, wait, I began one more time. This go around, I got 16 chapters in before stopping. As you surely know by now, this is a story about an almost bank robber, who made a poor selection of his target, and then flees into building only to stumble his way into holding hostages. When the story began claiming it was mostly about idiots, I should have taken that as a clue to move onto something else. (Just saying…) It didn't take long to figure out the issues I had with the audio probably had more to do with the story than the audio. The writing was confusing, although I think it intended to be funny, zany. The “whodunnit” vibe was lost quickly and a prevailing sense of annoyance took over. The characterization felt contrived of the latest social media hot topics. Many characters were downtrodden, bumbling even, and seemed to be made so as an excuse to introduce a variety of human conditions to pull sympathy out of the reader (Trying too hard). Other characters were supposed to be quirky but fell flat. (Don’t get me started on the real estate agent that kept saying, “How’s tricks?” over and over). And the similes were just odd. The air passes through the older policeman’s throat as roughly as a piece of heavy furniture being dragged across an uneven wooden floor.  During some weeks in winter in the central part of Scandinavia the sky doesn’t seem to bother even attempting to impress us, it greets us with the color of newspaper in a puddle, and dawn leaves behind it a fog as if someone has been setting fire to ghosts. Once I found myself skimming more pages than I was reading, it was time to move on. I am so surprised this book didn’t work for me, as I found A Man Called Ove delightful."

Jo stilius be galo specifinis, jis mėgsta kartotis, priminti, kad žino daugiau už skaitytoją ir kartais nemenkai tampyti šio kantrybę vis grįždamas prie to, kas neišvengiamai artėja. Jis neišranda dviračio ir pasakoja apie visiems gerai pažįstamus dalykus, kartais neišvengia klišių ir moka būti saldus, tačiau man jis – lyg grįžimas namo. Tas išsiilgtas pūkinis pledas, į kurį įsisupi, kai tau liūdna ar šalta. Tas, kuris nenuvils ir priims tave išskėstomis rankomis.Siužeto pasakoti nesinori, nes visa kūrinio magija atsiskleidžia jį atrandant. Tačiau Backmanas romane nenutolsta nuo to, ką moka geriausiai – parodyti žmonių žmogiškumą. Veikėjų čia daug, jie visi be galo skirtingi, tačiau kiekvienam skiriama pakankamai eterio, kad spėtum pažinti, o kai kuriais atvejais net gerokai suartėti ir prisirišti. Autorius daug kalba apie santykius – tiek romantinius (pačiose įvairiose jų stadijose), tiek šeimos, tiek apskritai nebeegzistuojančius, ir dar kartą įrodo, kad tam tikri dalykai yra nenuginčijamai universalūs. Noras būti suprastam, bet nenoras atsiverti, noras prisiglausti, bet nenoras pasirodyti silpnam, noras pasakyti ir padėkoti už tiek daug, bet nenoras prožektorių šviesų atsukti į save. Situacijos, į kurią patenka veikėjai, absurdas nenuginčijamas, bet tam tikra prasme dėl to pasakojimas tampa tik dar tikresnis. Nes juk įtempčiausiose situacijose dažnai priimame kvailiausius sprendimus. Nes nerimo nesuvaldysi, o jis kartais tikrai užvaldo mus. Nes kartais lengviau visas savo problemas iškloti visiškam nepažįstamam, negu artimiausiam žmogui, šalia kurio kasnakt užmiegi.Atskirai lenkiuosi prieš romano vertėją Virginiją Jurgaitytę – jau spėjau įsitikinti, kad skaitant angliškai Backmano magija kažkur šiek tiek pradingsta, todėl jei tik galit ir norit, skaitykit lietuvišką vertimą. Jis nuostabus ir gyvas, o vertėja, rodos, užmezgė tokį stebuklingą ryšį su autoriumi, kurio kai kuriems jos kolegoms reiktų pavydėti. Užvertusi paskutinį kiekvienos Backmano knygos puslapį jaučiuosi siaubingai melancholiškai – kartu be galo gera ir šilta viduj, tarsi gavus dozę laimės, bet tuo pačiu ir liūdna, nes iš naujo atrasti to jausmo nebegalėsiu. Bet visada su nekantrumu laukiu kitų autoriaus stebuklų."

Everything I do is quieter now,""“They say that a person’s personality is the sum of their experiences. But that isn’t true, at least not entirely, because if our past was all that defined us, we’d never be able to put up with ourselves. We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.”“We don't have a plan, we just do our best to get through the day, because there'll be another one coming along tomorrow.”“Some people accept that they will never be free of their anxiety, they just learn to carry it. She tried to be one of them. She told herself that was why you should always be nice to other people, even idiots, because you never know how heavy their burden is.”“Something my dad says...He says you end up marrying the one you don't understand. Then you spend the rest of your life trying.”“It's always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is.”“We are asleep until we fall in love.”Frederik Backman might just be an auto-read/purchase author for me now.______________________________Doing a 12 (+1) books recommended by friends in 12 months challenge!

296,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61187238-pani,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 definite stars!!Another special book from Fredrik Backman deserving all the stars!There are so many reasons why I loved this book and the complex, entertaining and quirky characters is the main one. Anxious People is a character driven novel and every single person contributes to the overall awesomeness of the book. The storyline was also very clever - at first it kind of seems like there is so much going on in the book and there are so many scattered characters and events but as our characters develop one by one, so does the story. Everything falls into place smoothly and once you get to the end of the book, you realize how beautifully the story has progressed to get to the end. It was superb!!There were moments in the book that I was laughing out loud and at times I was crying hard and that is a firm testimony of how clever and strong the author is with his words. Grab a copy and enjoy!Thank you to Simon & Schuster and NetGalley for providing this arc."

This book was full of surprises! So many I felt giddy with excitement. From the start I thought this would be abit lighthearted and silly but I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of my care factor for these colourful characters, I felt the bond of their predicament and loved how the story kept going in different directions none that I saw coming so I was genuinely impressed by the creativity of the author coming up with such a novelty idea for a book that gave way more than I was expecting, I also love how different all his books have been so far, I guess you never know what to expect from this author.

“It's always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you forget how idiotically difficult being human is.” 

Can this man stop making me cry already? There’s no author like Fredrik Backman and yes you should read this. He writes about real people, with real problems and it just always hits the right spot.It’s hard to explain.. he’s just that good.

306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82752791-lilli,Rating 4 out of 5,"I wasn't sure what to expect when a coworker recommended Anxious People to me, heralding it as the best book he might have ever read. That's a big label for any title and a lot of pressure for someone like me, who has been becoming choosier and choosier in regards to my reading tastes recently and more easily dissatisfied with what I'm reading than I ever have been before. Several times throughout, I wasn't sure if I DID like the book much, though I recognized the talent Fredrik Backman possesses. It's evident on each page and in each relationship just how thoughtful he is about his writing. (Don't worry guys, by the end, I more than liked the book. I really loved it.)This is the story of a bank robbery turned into a hostage drama, but it's really not about that at all. This story is about the driving forces behind each good and bad decision we make in our lives, particularly in regards to parenting, how we treat others, how we understand others, and how we forgive. It's about the intricate web of connections we have with other human beings and that they might have with one another, creating tethers unbeknownst to us. The plot of the story is interesting and pretty hilarious, but the plot isn't really the point of this story at all. It's definitely a story of relationships. It's about the relationship one has with themself, their partner, their children, their jobs, and the world around them. Each character is intricately carved by Backman to have real driving forces behind their actions and real consequences determined by the outcome. The pacing of this story never felt exactly quite right and I did have a harder time getting into it or getting excited to pick it back up when I would hit a lull. The second half of the book really picks up and redeems this fault of the first half of the book, and I always appreciate the device of an unreliable character. I wouldn't say the narrator was unreliable since it is being narrated objectively, but the bank robber most certainly wasn't who I thought they were. That part of the story made it infinitely more fun for me personally. The last 10% of the book or so had me very emotional. I was choked up through to the end.Where this story shines is in its empathy. Some characters are empathetic by nature and others are driven to empathy almost as if it is contagious from the others around them. I enjoyed what it had to say about individuals and their motivations in their separate lives, and how those motivations overlap and show how similar humans really are to one another. This book reminded me of the way group therapy feels. I always said in group that you learn so much about yourself from other people learning about themselves and that often you learn more from other people in a similarly distressing situation to your own than you do from the professional leading the group. It was heartwarming, endearing, silly, and lovely. Surprisingly, this was my first Backman, but I can't wait to listen to more of his audiobooks. This one was narrated by Marin Ireland and holy cow that woman can NARRATE an audiobook. Her narration was absolutely top-notch. She also narrates Beartown and the affable J.K. Simmons, one of my top 5 favorite actors, narrates A Man Called Ove, so I'll be adding those to my list pronto!"
307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95937457,No Rating,"DNF В началото на 2020 започнах с прочита на тази книга и тогава не ми се получи. Оставих я за някъде по-нататък и втори опит. Е, и сега резултатът е отново същия. Исках да ми хареса, но просто не става.Първо е стилът на писателя, който ми е някак накъсан и разпилян. Липсва ми онази свързаност и плавност между изреченията, която прави четенето гладко.Второто е и самата история и герои, където също ми цари някакъв хаос. Тук, пък там, пък това, пък онова. Което прави всичко някак трудно и неясно за възприемане. И накрая се достига до едно ниво, което наистина започва да действа изнервящо (както каза и Viktor Stoyanov в своето ревю преди време).Като пример мога да посоча „глава 2“, която е сравнително кратка. 
Преди десет години един мъж стоеше на мост. Историята не е за този мъж. Не е нужно да мислиш за него в този момент. Разбира се, сега не можеш да спреш да мислиш за него, това е като да ти кажат „не мисли за сладки“ – веднага започваш да мислиш за сладки. Не мисли за сладки!Достатъчно е да знаеш, че преди десет години един мъж стоеше на мост. Беше се качил на парапета, високо над водата, в самия край на живота си. Повече не мисли за това. Мисли за нещо по-приятно. Мисли за сладки.
Ъхъ, разбира се, веднага – слушам и изпълнявам. 😁И нататък се продължава горе-долу по същия начин. От глава 3.
Полицаят изглежда на не повече от двайсет години, но вероятно е по-стар. Брокерката изглежда като да е прехвърлила четиресетте, но вероятно е по-млада. Униформата на полицая е малко тясна, сакото на брокерката е малко широко. На брокерката като че ѝ се иска да се намира някъде другаде, а след последните петнайсет минути от разговора на полицая като че ли също му се иска тя да се намира някъде другаде.
Ясно е на какъв ефект разчита авторът, но пък за мен след цялото това празнословие изобщо не ми действа завладяващо, за да продължа да чета историята му и нататък. (И вече като чуя израза „словесна салата“ няма как да не се сещам и за тази книга 😂).Иначе забелязвам, че на доста хора от френд листа ми тук, книгата е харесала и са я оценили високо, лошо няма, разбира се – няма как на всички да ни харесва едно и също винаги.Ако не друго, поне корицата на книгата е някаква такава шантаво-весела, та създава настроение.Ще опитам и с някоя друга книга на автора след време, но ако стилът му и там е съвсем същия, има голяма вероятност да не ни се получи „магията“."

There are some heavy subjects in it but overall I thought this was a very uplifting book.A bank robber gets involved in a hostage situation in an apartment where a house viewing was just underway. These hostages turn out to be the ""worst hostages ever"" and that's where the story really gets going.It took me a while to get used to the writing style but once I did there was so much quality to the story. There were so many asides in this book that in the beginning it messed with the flow of the story a little bit, but most of the asides were funny and added to the story in the end, it just took a little getting used to.There were sharp and witty conversations, especially the one with the psychologist comes to mind, good stuff. ""And what do you do with your money?"" ""I buy distance from other people."" The psychologist had never heard that response before. There are interesting insights into all manner of subjects, for instance the difference between flying and falling, and again the conversations are intelligent and insightful. ""Have you ever held a three-year-old by the hand on the way home from pre-school?"" ""No."" ""You're never more important than you are then."" This is so true...This novel is also very well constructed, the different storylines come together nicely in the end, and I just loved how it all unfolded, it was endearing and even a bit emotional for me. The monkey and the frog just melted my heart. 😊I am looking forward to Backman’s other books, most notably Beartown and A Man Called Ove."

You mustn't tell lies, you mustn't steal, you mustn't kill, and you mustn't throw stones at birds. We all agree on that.Except maybe swans, because swans can actually be passive-aggressive little bastards. But apart from swans, you mustn't throw stones at birds.And so we're off and running, in a cold January Swedish town, finding ourselves caught up in the intertwining fates of parents and children, cops and robbers, doctors and patients, husbands and wives, rich folks and poor. There are lessons to be learned from each of these people, and we learn them, and then the book is over.Sorry. That description was rather ungracious. This was, for the most part, a fun book to read, and more importantly, the fun was in service to larger ideas. For me, it was an easier book to admire than to love. When I look at the books I love, they are about real, messy people people with real, messy problems. This book was about the solutions to messy problems, and the characters within, though well-drawn, ultimately existed to serve the lessons. This was done with great care, great skill, and obvious respect for the reader's time. I could not help feeling that this book went through at least 100 drafts, making it better, tighter, more clever each time. But to me, it felt more like a parable than a true story. This will doubtless bother other people less than me.Worth a look. This book has earned its popularity."

Backman weaves a tale around the couples and singles in the apartment. There are complicated issues in each of the character's lives and relationships, including the policemen, with odd connections between some of them initially, including actual and attempted suicides at a nearby bridge, and between some of them afterwards. His characters are quirky, but kindhearted. So why not more stars? Because I thought the book should have been called Annoying People. It took too long to get to the things that make Backman's books great, and the police interviews were nothing short of tedious, in my opinion. "

Backman carefully crafts a story that at first seems random, but slowly the people and events weave together into one beautiful tapestry. A desperate bank robber, that doesn't commit a robbery, accidentally escapes into an apartment that is having an open house and is full of potential buyers. The bank robber now has hostages for a bank robbery that didn't occur, and the apartment is surrounded by police and reporters. As if the bank robber isn't having a bad enough day, the hostages aren't the most cooperative people and have issues of their own to deal with. One by one the hostages start to open up to one another, and suddenly the hostages aren't strangers in a room anymore. Backman's writing is beautiful as ever, with nuggets of universal truths generously sprinkled throughout. This story didn't resonate with me as much as his previous books, but it's still a wonderful book that I highly recommend you read.Thank you to NetGalley and Atria for giving me a free copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."

""Anxious People,"" his latest novel does not disappoint either. At first I thought I wasn't going to like this one but the more I read, the more I became enchanted again with his writing. He can take a plot that seems like pure satire and through his character's interpersonal relationship's breathe pure love of humanity so that he makes a true believer out of me that his plot could happen. He writes with a philosophical style in his latest narrative. He was really able to transform me by his tender renderings of each character who treat each other in the end with so much love.I went from thinking I was not going to like this one to loving it. He writes the absurd happenings and can turn the tables of suspended belief into making me a true believer. There are not that many writer's who can turn the ludicrous plot into making it seem from being preposterous into making me willing to automatically believing that he is really writing about reality and life. ""The truth? The truth about all this? The truth is that this was a story about many different things, but most of all about idiots. Because we're doing the best we can, we really are. We're trying to be grown-up and love each other and understand how the hell you're supposed to insert USB-leads. We're looking for something to cling onto, something to fight for, something to look forward to. We're doing all we can to teach our children how to swim. We have all of this in common, yet most of us remain strangers, we never know what we do to each other, how your life is affected by mine. Perhaps we hurried past each other in a crowd today, and neither of us noticed, and the fibers of your coat brushed against mine for a single moment and then we were gone. I don't know who you are. But when you get home this evening, when this day is over and the night takes us, allow yourself a deep breath. Because we made it through this day as well. There'll be another one along tomorrow.""I am so enchanted by Fredrik Backman's writing. He has the power to make me believe that this world is a better place, especially in these difficult times.

318,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27298436-toni,Rating 5 out of 5,"Fredrik Backman’s unique talent of writing combined with his understanding of what makes people tick – pain, love, connection, and anxiety are on full display in this book: ‘Anxious People.’The enjoyment is the story told in the form of a puzzle or perhaps a light mystery and presented as “Dinner Theater” maybe. I feel as though the characters are on stage and I am watching them perform, but in the best possible way. Fredrick calls them all ‘idiots,’ but I believe he might mean they are just ‘average,’ people who just try to get by in life, doing the best they can. What turns out to be a comedy of errors: A viewing of an apartment for sale, on the day before New Year’s Eve, puts a small group of people into minor chaos but results in them learning more about themselves and their relationships than they have in the last ten years. Backman likes to make us think while he is telling us exactly what is going on. It is comparable to, “hiding in plain sight.” You are listening, or reading, but you are not quite sure you understand what he just told you. It will all make sense a few sentences or paragraphs later, not to worry.Our group is a mixed assortment: two couples, one older married a long time, one younger and expecting their first child; will both learn they really do love each other but show it in different ways. The single people all have a story behind too, of course. One is old and lonely, another is single, working and quite capable; yet another is getting divorced and has two young children, barely making ends meet. Our two policemen, father, and son carry some baggage too. Over the course of an exceedingly long day they all learn valuable lessons, meet interesting people, and realize the future can be bright. Now do not get the wrong idea, this is not some cozy rom-com. We start out with a bank-robber who runs into an apartment building smack into an open-house for an apartment for sale, with a roomful of people that become hostages. The bank-robber is wearing a ski-mask and wielding a pistol, so everyone pays attention. You should too, it is going to be a long day, but well-worth your time.Definitely one of Fredrik Backman’s BEST!Thank you Netgalley, Atria Books, and Fredrik Backman"
319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29190640-grazia,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Piantiamo un melo oggi, anche se sappiamo che domani il mondo finirà""Terminata la lettura stamane. Sorriso ebete, occhi lucidi, commossa e divertita.E col cuore più leggero: lo sguardo strampalato, surreale, ironico ma algido e tagliente di Backman mi ha giovato allo spirito.Di che parla 'sto libro? Come ripete in diversi incipit di capitoli, in modo retorico e un po' paraculo, ma fondamentalmente simpatico?Sicuramente non parla (anche se in apparenza così potrebbe sembrare) di una rapina a mano armata, di una presa di ostaggi, di banche e di ponti.La verità? La verità su tutto questo? La verità è che questa storia parla di molte cose diverse, ma soprattutto di gente stupida. Perché facciamo il massimo, anche noi. Tentiamo di cavarcela a diventare adulti e amarci e capire come accidenti si infilano i cavi USB. Cerchiamo qualcosa a cui aggrapparci, qualcosa per cui combattere e qualcosa a cui tendere. Facciamo tutto il possibile per insegnare ai nostri figli a nuotare. Abbiamo tutte queste cose in comune e comunque rimaniamo perlopiù estranei tra noi, non sappiamo mai cosa facciamo l’uno all’altro, come la tua vita influenza la mia.Forse oggi ci siamo passati accanto di sfuggita nella calca e nessuno di noi se n’è accorto, le fibre del tuo cappotto si sono intrecciate per un singolo istante con quelle del mio e poi abbiamo proseguito. Non so chi sei. Ma quando arriverai a casa stasera, quando questa giornata sarà finita e la notte ci prenderà, concediti un respiro profondo. Perché siamo sopravvissuti anche a questa. E domani ne inizierà un’altra. Davvero un gran dono riuscire a parlare di certi temi (non voglio rivelare nulla) con una grazia così lieve."
320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114718913-denise,Rating 5 out of 5,"~5⭐️~This book was full of beautiful quotes.🥹🫶🏻So it was written the error of human nature. I hate people but I love humans, if that makes sense. People are horrid, let's be honest. The arguments, the fights, the bad and the worst. But I love seeing an old couple laughing on a bench, or a kid smiling on a swing with their dad right behind ready to catch them, or a mother who's talking on a phone with her sister about the new carpet she got for her children, and how the prices were so high for so long she had to wait a while but it was worth it, more so that her husband decided to buy it because he's just selfless like that, or seeing a person read in the park, or someone else feeding the pigeons or the little ducks. In my opinion, love is human and the not so loving parts of us? Well, that's just all people. People are anxious, humans are lost. People try to find justification for any type of bad behavior. Humans are trying to find their purpose in life. You can watch people closely but you can observe and see the human mind. It's palpable how wrong we are when we say a person equals a human. It's like saying ""If a whale is a mammal, then all fish are mammals. An elephant cannot be a mammal since he doesn't live in the ocean.""This book was purely...human; and I loved every second of it🥲 And right now I'm anxious to write a proper review because no amount of words could justify the brilliance of this book."

I don’t really read books like this so it was a bit out of my comfort zone as I read 99% romance books soooo but I decided to pick it up for em.anyways, this book is all over the place but to be honest I really liked that about this book. If you were to look into my mind right now this book would be an accurate example of what it would look like: chaotic, all over the place, and confusing. i related to so many things in this book and basically highlighted 70% of this book. In the end this book is pretty confusing and messes with you head but I really enjoyed it. 5✨.again please check the triggers for this book before reading and if you need anyone to talk to my dms (drewreadss on insta) are open but here are some helpful resources as well, you’re not alone 🫶- national suicide prevention hotline: 800-273-8255- crisis text line: text “talk” to 741741 - carrd of suicide support resources: https://suicidesupport.carrd.co/- mental health resources: https://thesafeplace.carrd.co/"
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43561053-jess-thegreeneyedreader,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars - Thank you @librofm for providing me with a free audiobook copy of this book. I read 75% of this one and finished the last bit via the audiobook. This is a story ultimately about the power of connection and the impact people have on others. In true Backman fashion all of the individual stories of the various characters was well developed and I really enjoyed this one. This is, however, the first Backman book that didn’t make me cry and bring out the full range of emotions. That said, it was still very good.The primary story told in this book is about a bank robber that attempts to rob a cashless bank and ultimately ends up in the middle of a hostage situation. While trapped in an apartment, the bankrobber’s story is revealed along with the stories of the hostages, which connect and intertwine with the lives of a psychologist, a man that committed suicide many years before, and father/son police duo.It’s a heartfelt story from beginning to end, riddled with lots of sarcastic humor in the middle.I give it a 4.5 star rating and I would definitely recommend it."
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/125440012-maisha-farzana,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Anxious Poeple"" reminded me, all over again, why actually I love to read so much. Books like this is the reason I read...To feel something; to silence the voices in my head for a moment...I'm so happy right now that I could cry. Maybe I should just give in to the instinct, be the drama queen I actually am and start crying...screaming at the top of my lungs or act dead for a couple of days?? Can't decide which one I should do...Fredrik Backman is a manipulative genius. I had known ""Anxious People"" would be a 5 stars for me since the moment I laid my eyes on it. Turns out it's not a 5 stars read but also a new all time favourite for me. Adding this babe to my best books of 2022 list.Words will fail to describe how much I enjoyed this book. It was a fantastic novel. I'm gonna try to write a review, even though I'm not feeling very confident to do so.Full review to come..."
324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany,Rating 4 out of 5,"Backman's writing style is depressing and hilarious. How?This is a review about a story. A story that is about a bank robber, idiots and love, oh and a bridge. I enjoyed the quippy little chapters (still thinking about cookies) and appreciated the nuance of those that dove real deep into the darkness.A bank robber robs a cashless bank and then runs into an apartment viewing, somewhat inadvertently taking hostages. A pair of cops investigates and as per the normal Backman fair, these characters (even the prickly ones) grab hold of a piece of your heart and how they relate to each other slowly comes out.My only complaint is that this could've been a little less wordy at parts, but I enjoyed the message at the end. Rounding up to 4."

Το Άνθρωποι με αγχος εχει να κανει με τους ανθρώπους και τις σχέσεις που δημιουργούν μεταξύ τους αλλά και το αντίκτυπο που έχουν οι άνθρωποι ο ενας στον άλλο . Εγω το θεώρησα εξυπνο και διαφορετικο από ότι εχω διαβάσει μέχρι στιγμής . Υπάρχουν πολύ χαρακτήρες και οσο διάβαζα περισσότερο συγκινήθηκα , ήταν έντονο .

326,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41361775-akash-turtle,Rating 5 out of 5,"It's hard to find books that are truly different. Fitting a genre or mold is not necessarily bad but when you find an author with such a different approach it adds to the reading experienceThe structure of this story, the humor perfectly blended with poignancy and the character development that sneaks up on you makes it a wonderful experience to read. Everything about this book is wonderful...the characters, writing, story..it's just brilliant. Fredrik Backman weaves together a story that's funny, sad, poignant, heartwarming, and uplifting, all at the same time..This is a must-read if you’re looking for a book that mixes good humor with an emotional plot!"
327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146609929-sophie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. I went into this book expecting a hostage situation that gave us a little back story on each one of the characters. And I was wrong. This book is about individuals that were all somehow involved with this hostage situation. But this book is about people and their lives. I laughed, I annotated, I got choked up, I loved it. Backman’s writing style was fantastic. It requires a lot of focus though as it time hops and there are a lot of characters. I didn’t have a hard time keeping track of them though because they were all so distinct and unique. But the writing is so intricate that I felt glued to them and also re-reading at times because it was so dense. Ugh, too good."
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11215896-nina-ninjasbooks,Rating 5 out of 5,"Eg starta på denne boka tre ganger og hadde gitt opp fordi eg var litt skuffa. Den var så bisarr og ulik andre bøker fra forfatteren. Men så sa en venn til meg: Ikkje gi opp. Så tredje gangen fullførte eg boka, og er veldig glad for det. Karakterene i boka vokste og blei mennesker, ikkje berre tullinger som var irriterende og dumme. Forfatteren klarer det kunstverket å vise at når vi blir kjent med et menneske si historie, så liker vi dei. Empatien og sympatien vokser, og på slutten av boka sit du med en varm kjensle av at verda tross alt er en god plass å vere. "
329,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley,Rating 5 out of 5,"Stockholm!...Is there really anything else to say about this book?Of course there is. But a humorous and rather deep and hard-hitting book like this needs a really good hook, and everything else is journey.In this book, I admit I figured out the grand mystery in the first tenth of the book, but I didn't care. Characters, their drama, and the conflict that is the world, itself, made this story something special.Saying anything else will spoil your enjoyment. Just look at the author's name and trust him as I trusted him. You'll be fine. Promise."
