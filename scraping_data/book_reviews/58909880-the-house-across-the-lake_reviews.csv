0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48328025-megs-bookrack,Rating 5 out of 5,"**4.5-stars rounded up**Casey Fletcher is a NYC-based actress, who having grown up in the industry, is used to a lot of drama.Unfortunately for Casey, after suffering a personal tragedy, she makes a mistake many people have made before her. She turns to the bottle to numb her pain. Initially, she's still able to function somewhat, but she's spiraling fast, head-first into the NYC pavement. Luckily, the paparazzi is there to capture her descent for the whole world to see. ((read with heavy sarcasm))Casey's mother, in an ill-advised effort to help her daughter, ships her off to their Vermont lake house, because we all know being secluded in the middle of nowhere on a lake will make you quit drinking.Frankly, Casey could use a break from the city anyway, so she doesn't put up much of a fight. Her mother thinks since Casey doesn't have a car there, she won't be able to get alcohol, but the friendly neighbor who is making her grocery runs keeps her fully stocked.At the lake house, Casey struggles just as much as in the city. It is the last place she was with her husband and the root of her misery.Drinking her days away, Casey is obviously not in a good head space. She struggles to concentrate on anything, or remain focused, that is until she begins to utilize the family binoculars.Across the lake is a massive modern home recently purchased by an uber-wealthy couple, Tom and Katherine Royce. Tom, a successful businessman and Katherine, a stunning former model, give Casey plenty to focus on. After a shocking encounter on the lake brings Casey and Katherine together, the two women begin a tentative friendship. The more the women chat and get to know one another, the more clear it becomes to Casey that all is not well in the Royce household.Not long after, Katherine suddenly vanishes. Casey, having witnessed some very suspicious behaviors from the couple before, thinks violence may have been involved. She doesn't believe Katherine just up and left of her own volition.Casey becomes obsessed with revealing the truth, but at what cost?Y'all know, I have been itching to get my hands on this release and it did not disappoint. With his signature-style, Riley Sager has spun another web of intrigue so delicious even Alfred Hitchcock would be giving it two thumbs up!I loved the modern-Rear Window vibes and the setting was fantastic. Having Casey being on her own, in the house that literally haunted her just by being there, it felt so claustrophobic and unsettling. It can be tough sometimes being on your own, but Casey being alone at that house was taking it to a whole new level of isolation. Sager paced out the reveals of the before perfectly, in my opinion. It kept me so interested.I also really enjoyed, not just Casey as a main character, but all her interactions and musings involving the Royces. They certainly kept her mind occupied, at least for a little while.There were additional side characters, two men in particular, that added a lot to the story as well. They were also residing on the lake at the time that Casey was there and I felt they both added in their own way to the drama unfolding. One was a solid presence, who it felt good to have around, the other, I wasn't so sure about.The ending of this is completely over-the-top and caught me by surprise. It's definitely one of his more memorable conclusions. Trust me when I say, it's a wild ride.We started in one direction and ended in another. It was jolting and f*ing enjoyable as heck!! I really had a phenomenal time reading this. I know that not every Reader is going to love Casey as a protagonist as much as I did, but I found her relatable and even charming in her own clunky way.This was my most anticipated release of the year and I'm so happy that I was given the opportunity to get to it a little early. Thank you so much to the publisher, Dutton, for providing me with a copy to read and review."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58160628-emily-books-with-emily-fox-on-youtube,Rating 2 out of 5,"I’ve officially learned my lesson. This will be my last book by the author.Pro: The cover is pretty.Cons: Where do I even begin…This book feels like 3 different ones shoved together. Badly. It started with an overused trope. Alcoholic nosy woman spying on the neighbours. The author cannot write a convincing female character. This time she was reading into the fact that the wife leaving in the house across the lake would go swim without her wedding ring. Clearly a sign there are issues in her marriage. Did no editor tell him that plenty of people remove them to swim in a lake? Also what was up with her judging the husband for eating frozen burritos when she’s drinking bourbon all day with grilled cheese? Also even though she’s a famous actress, she’s conveniently not into social media.I hate when a big piece of information is hidden from you for most of the book. It sure wouldn’t have been the same if you knew from the start that the MC knows her husband killed 3 girls and she murdered him for it.The paranormal came out practically out of nowhere. I know the author has often played with the “is it paranormal or people” which I like but this time it wasn’t well executed. The neighbour’s wife being possessed by her dead husband was just... a completely different book.Ended with an unnecessary romance (again). I still think Boone killed his wife lol*Made it to my worst books of 2022: https://youtu.be/jOcHnWSUOEw"
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11232712-joey-r,Rating 1 out of 5,"1.5 stars— There really are no words that can adequately describe this book. The first 2/3 of the book was basically A J Finn’s “The Woman in the Window” but set at a lake house to shake things up. Much like “The Woman in the Window” and “The Girl on The Train” the woman who observes what she believes to be a crime in this book is drunk 24/7. (**Note to authors : from here on out sober witnesses only, thank you, drunks have run their course).The final 1/3 of “The House Across the Lake” is a cross between “The Exorcist” and the Meryl Streep movie “Death Becomes Her” . … This is not meant as a compliment. Needless to say I did not enjoy this book but kept reading it just to find out how the author would tie it all together for a happy ending. And amazingly enough, somehow he did. So if you are in the mood to read about a crazy, nosey murdering alcoholic helping a possessed neighbor who is in danger of being killed by her husband who is later possessed before being killed by a woman who was formerly possessed by the spirit of her ex husband who she also killed, have at it. For me, I am moving on to a better book while I recover from Covid.**Note if this review sounds like delusional ramblings, remember I have Covid and my oxygen levels might be off"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137657144-haley-pham,Rating 5 out of 5,I AM SHOCKED THAT NOT EVERYONE IS GIVING THIS 5 STARS?!?!?! HELLO?!? DID WE READ THE SAME BOOK!?!?!? READ THIS NOW
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/124132123-lisa-of-troy,Rating 1 out of 5,"Riley Sager’s The House Across the Lake is another doozy.The plotline sounds so promising, interesting. Casey Fletcher is a 35-year-old woman who is from a famous family. She is reeling from the recent death of her husband, drowning her sorrows in the warm arms of alcohol. After having a publicity nightmare, Casey��s famous mother sends Casey to their family lake house to lie low. While relaxing and drinking to the max, Casey spies her new neighbor Katherine, also a famous actress, in a swimming mishap. Casey jumps at the chance to rescue Katherine, and the two strike up a quick friendship.However, Katherine disappears. What happened to her? And who is responsible?The first 50% of the book is boring, and the last half of the book is eye-rollingly bad. At the beginning of the book, there is an information dump of Casey’s background. No subtle discoveries here. Casey also uses her binoculars to spy on her neighbors. This could have been a very promising storyline, but it wasn’t. The spying neighbor would have been better with some steam. Sager does try to write some of it as steamy but the attempt falls flat. Contributing to this miss is the narrator. Although the narrator, Bernadette Dunne, is acclaimed, she is the wrong choice for The House Across the Lake. As mentioned earlier, Casey Fletcher is 35 years old. For reference, Megan Fox is 36 years old. However, Bernadette Dunne is around 60 years old (according to my internet sleuthing). Just to be clear, Dunne is a terrific narrator, and she has credits under her belt such as Memoirs of a Geisha (which I loved). I just had an extremely difficult time matching this narrator’s voice to our main character.The storytelling is just off in this book. Recently, I was reading a book, Daemon Voices, a collection of essays about storytelling by my favorite author, Philip Pullman. In one of his essays, he set the scene as storytellers standing on corners, telling their stories. With every sentence, the author has to try to keep the people entertained, enraptured, or else the audience will get bored and go listen to another story. In this case, I feel that Sager should have worked more on his storytelling skills, because The House Across the Lake did not hold my attention.In Daemon Voices, Pullman stated that he wrote about a dozen different version of His Dark Materials. He has a commitment to quality. I would like that same commitment to quality from Riley Sager. He needs to fire his editor and get some additional beta readers. This book makes me really sad because 1) I feel a bit cheated out of my money and 2) Riley Sager is capable of so much more. He does need to get rid of the “yes” people on this team though.Overall, this book is boring and gets worse from there.2024 Reading Schedule	Jan	MiddlemarchFeb	The Grapes of WrathMar	Oliver TwistApr	Madame BovaryMay	A Clockwork OrangeJun	PossessionJul	The Folk of the Faraway Tree CollectionAug	Crime and PunishmentSep	Heart of DarknessOct	Moby-DickNov	Far From the Madding CrowdDec	A Tale of Two CitiesConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta"
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16912659-dorie---cats-books,Rating 3 out of 5,"3 ½ * rounded down to a 3I am a huge fan of Mr. Sager and I have been ruminating on this review for 2 days now. All of his previous books have been 4 and even a 5* for me. I’m sorry to say that this one was a disappointment. Casey Fletcher was a successful film and then theater star until her husband’s death about a year ago. This set off months of binge drinking which left her fired from her last production. Social media has been cruel and photos have appeared everywhere of her drinking and acting in all manner of inappropriate ways. Neither her best friend, her sister or mother have been able to help get her back on track.Her mother, a film star in her own right, has given Casey a choice. Enter rehab or spend time at their secluded lake house in Vermont. Casey chose the latter. Being alone however has only made her drink more and she finds herself bored and spending time on her porch staring out at the dark surface of Lake Green. When she finds her husband’s binoculars which he used for birding, she begins to spy on her neighbors across the lake. They are a famous couple, Katherine is a supermodel and her husband Tom is pioneering a tech company.One morning Casey sees a body floating on the lake. She takes action quickly and ends up saving Katherine from drowning. They become friends but Casey becomes more and more convinced that something is not right with their marriage.This sends Casey off in a myriad of ways, trying to discover what is really going on in the house across the lake.I HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS BOOK!!First off, so much of the first half of the book seemed like a rehash of “The Woman In The Window”, I kept waiting for the pace to pick up but that didn’t happen until 60% into the book.The characters seemed very flat to me, so unlike Riley’s other books. I didn’t really feel engaged with any of them and Casey’s actions were just downright juvenile and reckless. The amount of alcohol she is said to drink would surely leave her beyond reasoning in any competent way.There were lots of twists, but they all came at the end, one right after the other and mostly unbelievable. That’s o.k. I still had hopes for a stellar ending!!NOPE THAT DIDN’T HAPPEN!! What I read felt like a combination of folklore, fantasy , supernatural or the feeling of “WHAT THE HECK DID I JUST READ”. I’m still giving this a 3* because I enjoy Sager’s style of writing and this could have been more engaging if the twists had been more well placed throughout instead of all left until the end!So far I am the outlier for this one so give it a try, you may love it!!l I will continue to be a fan of this author and will be on the lookout for his next novel.I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through NetGalley."

  *****SPOILERS*****
About the book:Casey Fletcher, a recently widowed actress trying to escape a streak of bad press, has retreated to the peace and quiet of her family’s lake house in Vermont. Armed with a pair of binoculars and several bottles of liquor, she passes the time watching Tom and Katherine Royce, the glamorous couple who live in the house across the lake. They make for good viewing—a tech innovator, Tom is rich; and a former model, Katherine is gorgeous.One day on the lake, Casey saves Katherine from drowning, and the two strike up a budding friendship. But the more they get to know each other—and the longer Casey watches—it becomes clear that Katherine and Tom’s marriage is not as perfect and placid as it appears. When Katherine suddenly vanishes, Casey becomes consumed with finding out what happened to her. In the process, she uncovers eerie, darker truths that turn a tale of voyeurism and suspicion into a story of guilt, obsession and how looks can be very deceiving.Release Date: 06/21/2022Genre: ThrillerPages: 368Rating: ⭐Read: March 20th, 2022What I Liked:	• The cover	• The writing has gotten better What I Didn't Like:	• Across the lake is mentioned a ton	• The plot feels like something we've read/watched 1, 000 times before	• Troup of broke husband married to rich woman	• 183 mentions to the word water	• The ""twist"" ending	• The ending	• Another female leadOverall Thoughts:This is the first time I've ever received a disclaimer (**Please note: this book has some major surprises and we encourage you to keep reviews SPOILER-FREE to preserve the reading experience for everyone**) for a book before. Does it make me want to listen? No. There was a study done that when people are told NOT to do something it makes them want to. It feels weird to be told to review a book honestly but not talk about spoilers. So no one ever should write a review that talks about it? That's not me so here's my SPOILER review. If you're like me you don't expect much from Riley Sager, so when I was sent this book for review I was eager to jump right in. In typical Sager fashion, we have a woman as our main character who is alone. For me, the conversations between the characters always feel so cheap and fake. Like there is something off about it.Why is there always some kind of actor in his books? The last one was a girl who dreamed of movies and now this one is an actress. His books always remind me of when you fall asleep to one movie but wake up to another movie. He always mixes one movie with another movie. In this case, it's Rear Window. The descriptions to the window and how they travel seamlessly through each room that's Hitchcock's Rear Window aká  It Had to Be Murder for which Hitchcock based Rear Window. The author even mentions how what she is doing is like Rear Window. Riley Sager has this way of writing situations with women that on a normal day would make them feel uncomfortable, yet he acts like it's normal. Maybe because he's a man he can't get what it's like for a female. There's a part where Casey is watching the neighbors across the lake with binoculars and a man she doesn't know asks her if she's enjoying the view. Does Casey act so startled that she acts in a normal way? No, she is calm and jokes back with him. Like no no no! A woman alone in the middle of the woods would NOT just act all happy and think this stranger is cute. She would think this strange man just showed up out of nowhere at my house while I am alone and he could hurt me. That's where he always loses me. The women don't react to normal dangers.Yay..... Another HOT handyman 🥴Now you know you're in a Riley Sager book How is she seeing this much going on with the binoculars at nighttime in the dark? She can see him smiling while he is on the water. She mentions that last night was foggy. How did she see across the lake? How did she see so clearly everything that Boone was doing? So did her husband really use these binoculars to look at birds or to stalk women? I love that in this book the abuse that Katherine did to Tom (punching him in his face) is his fault because he grabbed her first. Imagine if roles were reversed... If Tom hit Katherine because she grabbed his arm. Our dear binocular-watching stalker would have been on the phone with the police. Agh. The women in these books are always so ridiculous. There is so outlandish and jump to conclusions so fast it's insane. I love how she's had like three conversations with this Katherine lady and suddenly she knows that she's been murdered by her husband because she's not returning her phone call. How did she not hear Boone open the door when he said he heard the scream? Earlier she had mentioned that she was able to hear the screen door squeak when it was open I doubt very much he was being quiet when he opened the screen door and stepped out this time since he heard a scream. Wouldn't he have checked on the neighbor to see if she was okay? I love how calm she is when Boone is in her house. She remembers him showing up in her house when all the doors were locked. She wakes up the next morning and has breakfast with him because he made her food. The other thing that's annoying is when a man tells her to do something and she obeys and then finds out that he's right. Boone tells her to eat food and she'll feel better - she does - and now she is shoveling the food down.Why does every Riley Sager book have to have some stupid man whose quote sexy show up in this girl's life and always have to save her in some way?Every drink Ellie has seems to give her superpowers. She has like 8 or 12 drinks and she's able to tow across a lake during a storm that's turned the water choppy. Being that wasted I would assume she couldn't do much other than pass out. It's mentioned before she's had 6 drinks and passed out on the porch chair all night, but here she is being a superhero. Was Riley Sager drunk when he came up with that weird plot twist of Katherine being possessed by Len's body 🤔Was easy to guess Len was the killer as the murders stopped almost exactly up to the point he died. Plus hasn't it been the boyfriend a few times in his books? If he knew he had the licenses in the tackle box why oh why would he be cool with her getting the lighter? You're going to tell me he forgot about them in there. Then she's gone long enough that she can call two hotels to find out about if he stayed there and he briefly questions her being gone so long to get a lighter.... Also how RIDICULOUS is it that she finds out he is a killer and decided at that moment that she is just going to kill him, comes up with a plan in 10 minutes, and is he is dead in a few hours. Not sure how no one on this quiet lake that had people in the house on a summer night heard anything. How Riley sager assumes people are reading his book  and how I'm reading it  when I got to the twist.I've watched a lot of interviews with killers and so I think it's odd how much Len is saying he did all of this because of his messed-up childhood. Most times killers just talk about how it's a feeling that they get I can't really recall many of them blaming their childhoods. I'm sure there are a few but he just sounds the opposite of a killer. Killers love taking the blame for their murders and he seems like he's making an excuse to dissociate from them.Nowhere in this book up this point did it even hint at a supernatural element. It's out of the blue that now there's a possession. What a dumb ending. So no one swam in the lake for 18 months that he could have possessed? At first, I thought it had to be someone that had died but he was able to possess Casey so anyone swimming could have been possessed. Riley sager treats alcoholism as though it's something you can switch on and off. She just manages to forget she hasn't had a drink in hours or days when before she was getting shaky not having it. She then purges the house of all the alcohol like it's nothing. It's never explained why Katherine was on the laptop and turned around startled when Tom caught her. Or why she wasn't allowed on the phone with Boone when she rushed off the phone when Tom caught her. Boone's wife killed herself by throwing herself down the stairs??? What? Who kills themselves in such a weird way? Seriously someone give me one person who has killed themself in this way. Not sure why Casey is suddenly now worried about where the bodies are at when before she didn't care at all before. They come up with a plan to tell the police that Katherine was just found coming out of the woods lost. What about the rope burns on her wrists? There's no evidence that she was out in the elements for days. Oh, then we find out Tom is trying to kill her for real. He shows up at Casey's house doing this  but with a wine bottle because what couldn't be a whiter thing to do. I kept laughing picturing him getting in a boat with a wine bottle to look so threatening. How did he know right at that moment that she was going to remember the drug residue on the glass that broke when she never mentioned it to him before? It doesn't make any sense for Len to talk to Tom about what Casey did because he was still in love with her. It's so stupid that he still wants to go through with killing his wife when not 2 days ago they all were suspecting him! Oh and he wants to kill Casey too because she knows the truth. Dude, everyone is going to notice she's missing after all this weird shit went down. Casey manages to kill him with the wine bottle. What a weird and desperate twist the author tried to insert here. It was so cheesy and misplaced. How did Tom get to the other side of the lake that she never noticed and no one saw him?PS - the storm turns out to be nothing than a small rain storm 🤷🏻‍♀️. This whole time it's talked about and it goes flat. Final Thoughts: The whole time I wanted it to be Katherine and Boone having an affair and trying to bump off Tom because she didn't want to share her money with him anymore. Oh, Eli was working with Len and they murdered those girls. Sad that the ending he gave was the best he had going for him.This book was odd. It feels like he's running out of ideas. I'd tell the author to take some time off and come back with a book that's not rushed.

Thanks to Netgalley and the publishers for this advanced copy of the book. All thoughts and opinions are my own.Previous review: I hope this one is about a girl who makes stupid mistakes, constantly puts herself into danger, and falls in love with the killer but doesn't know it despite all the warning signs being there."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/138801181-ali-goodwin,Rating 4 out of 5,THE ENDING WAS WILD and I never saw it coming. My first Riley Sager book and I will definitely be reading more!!
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53701594-nilufer-ozmekik,Rating 4 out of 5,"Wow! I have so many complex feelings about this book! Some parts made me scream “come on! It’s too far fetched and ridiculous!” when some out of nowhere elements hit you in the face out of nowhere! But some parts are truly entertaining, surprising which made me awe the author’s dark sense of humor! I don’t think this will be my favorite book of Riley Sager but I have to admit : it’s absolutely unusual, creative, twisty, mind spinning!At the beginning main character Casey Fletcher made me so irritated! I got it she’s grieving from a big trauma! She lost her husband but I didn’t understand the main reason of self hatred and choice to drink herself to death!  The book started slow burn. Casey kept numbing her pain with more booze, self sabotaging, spying on neighbors, getting more dislikable person at each chapter! And mostly she stuck in the same cycle till she thinks something happened to her neighbor! But when got reach the last third I felt that sudden sucker punch on my face! Yes, so many unexpected things start occurring that destroying your last remaining marbles! You keep signing “ I got voices in my head and they won���t go! The spirits in my head and they won’t go” for a tribute to the Strumbellas! The shit totally hits the fan! It is a combination of Hitchcock’s masterpiece “ Rear Window” with Woman in the window ( it’s also inspired by Hitchcock’s work), Girl on the train and Colho’s Layla!Main characters are not so much likable but at the end eventually you learn to tolerate with them! Maybe you dislike them because they are way too much privileged types; Casey Fletcher: a daughter of Broadway star mother, mostly trying too hard not to live under her stardom’s shadow, getting involved into tabloid scandal after she’s been sacked from her Broadway play for consuming too much alcohol!  Now she’s at the lake house where her husband was drowned. She recently saves the life of Katherine Royce who was also about to get drowned in the lake just like her husband. Katherine is ex supermodel, new philanthropist, married to Thomas, founder of social media company called “ Mixer”, such an intense, pretentious, absolutely another irritating character! Casey inherited her husband’s binoculars and using them to spy on her neighbors instead of scrolling through several trashy formats on Netflix which is totally understandable. When Katherine is AWOL, she thinks her husband might be involved in her disappearance. Didn’t Katherine tell her she kept paying everything for her husband’s social media app and he wouldn’t let her go without a fight. ( he can go far to kill her! ) But when Casey digs deeper she realizes there’s also a serial killer targeting young girls in town. Could Tom be also responsible from those incidents?  Overall: I was planning to give three stars after that unexpected, out of nowhere twist but last third was way too much gripping, fast pacing and entertaining for me! So I decided to round up 3.5 stars to 4 girl power, haunting lake stars! For the record: I wouldn’t be so generous if I wasn’t a big fan of the author!"
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11345366-jayme,Rating 3 out of 5,"One, two, three, one two three, drinkOne, two, three, one, two three drinkOne, two, three, one, two three, drinkThrow’em back till I lose count.(lyrics of Chandelier by Sia) I couldn’t help but think of this song as disgraced former actress, Casey Fletcher spends her days and nights, in a “bourbon haze” drinking to forget all that happened over the past year. 🥃She has retreated to her family’s lake house in Vermont, located on Lake Greene, and armed with binoculars she watches Tom and Katherine Royce, who live in the house across the lake. Floor to ceiling windows make their modern structure resemble a doll house from the back, each room clearly illuminated against the murky lake and pitch black night. Serious “The Woman In The Window” (A.J. Finn) vibes for the first 50%.Fortunately, her voyeurism pays off when she is able to rescue Katherine Royce from drowning. She appeared to be dead but sputtered back to life, and the two hit it off. Instantly.But, will she be able to save her friend, a second time, when she disappears? Fortunately, Boone, a “hot former cop” is staying in the lake house next door-so the two can team up. (How convenient) I was really struggling at this point, despite our leading lady’s witty sense of humor, and a few clever references to places from earlier books, such as the “ The Bartholomew” and being a Nightingale Girl. The story just lacked the atmosphere and complexity of past work. The book is told from the alternating timelines of BEFORE and NOW, with an eerie photograph of the lake before each NOW chapter. Look carefully and you might see a reflection in it. Centuries ago, it was a common belief that reflective surfaces could trap the souls of the dead. Alcohol, however, can trap the souls of the living, and I grew weary of Casey’s reliance on the bottle.There are a couple of twists that I didn’t see coming. The first, I never suspected and really liked. The second, I didn’t guess either, but I really disliked it.  A lot.Should have ended it with the first! I have read each of Riley Sager’s books and all have earned 4 or 5 stars from me, until now. I just wanted this one to end, and if it hadn’t been for twist #1-my rating may have even been lower. 😬A buddy read with Mary Beth-be sure to read her amazing review for another opinion! Thank You to my local Public library for the loan!"
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28082207-sujoya-theoverbookedbibliophile---lots-of-catching-up-to-do,Rating 2 out of 5,"2.5⭐After a drunken debacle causes her to lose her latest role and earns her bad press, 35-year-old actress, Casey Fletcher retreats to her family’s vacation home on Greene Lake in Vermont. A little over a year ago, Casey's husband drowned in the lake which seems to have triggered her alcohol dependence. Haunted by her memories, she spends most of her time in an alcohol-induced haze and spying on her neighbors with her late husband’s binoculars. The “house across the lake” is owned by a power couple - tech entrepreneur Tom and his wife Katherine, a famous model. After saving Katherine from drowning in the lake, Casey and Katherine become friendly. Casey witnesses ( with her binoculars, of course) what she thinks is a disagreement between the couple ( very “Rear Window”, which coincidentally was her and her late husband's favorite movie), and when Katherine disappears, Casey suspects that Tom had something to do with it. As Casey tries to find out what happened to Katherine, she seeks the help of Boone Conrad, an ex-cop who is temporarily staying in the neighborhood while doing some work on another resident’s home, who also has secrets of his own. Will Casey be able to find Katherine before it is too late?  To be honest, up to the 70% mark, the story seemed formulaic –alcoholic protagonist/unreliable narrator, Rear Window style snooping into a neighbor’s window witnessing an altercation of sorts between a couple in a presumably troubled marriage, the wife goes missing and then alcoholic nosy neighbor becomes alcoholic super sleuth et cetera et cetera. Long-drawn and overly descriptive, I found the first half of the novel more than a tad boring. But then, everything I predicted turned out to be WRONG! Usually, I love being proved wrong but in this case, I would have preferred a predictable ending. While the initial 70% was boring and unoriginal but readable, the final segment and the major twist made things worse. Given the time I had already invested in the book, I forced myself to finish it. I wasn’t particularly thrilled with the weird direction the story took but yes, I was surprised as all my theories got tossed into the lake! Though not quite original in concept, Riley Sager’s The House Across the Lake is suspenseful and twisty and I can see how it might appeal to others but unfortunately, it did not work for me!"
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514998-rachel-l,Rating 2 out of 5," 2 stars Wow, Riley Sager has really bombed with these last two releases. This is possibly one of the worst suspense novels I have read in a while. The House Across the Lake has the most interesting premise, a nosy neighbor who spies on her neighbors across the lake and thinks a husband has murdered his wife. But in reality, it was beyond boring and the twists were completely unbelievable and laughable. I found myself muttering “what the fuck” to myself while reading this book and not in a good way.Not sure if Sager has lost his touch/giving into pressure and demand for more books, but this one and Survive the Night were not it. I’m mad I wasted a libro.fm credit on this one. I think I’ll never get that reading high like I did for Home Before Dark and Last Time I Lied ever again…Side note: I thought the main character of the book was an old woman because that’s what the narrator of the audiobook sounds like.

12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10171516-jessica,Rating 3 out of 5,"oof. i think this is RSs book ive enjoyed the least… HOWEVER! i didnt hate this like it seems a good amount of other readers did. i easily finished this, but that doesnt mean there werent some bumps along the way.first of all, i will go on record and say that when i read one of RSs previous books, i complained that there wasnt a (supernatural element) when it would have perfectly fit the tone of the story. so now i feel a little hypocritical because its present in this story, but i didnt like it. it honestly comes out of left field and i think, had it been integrated a little more into the story instead of being chucked in at the end, it may have worked. i think it just needed a little more explanation and i could have been on board with it. that being said, i can understand why is was included and i like the concept. the whole “unreliable alcoholic female narrator witnesses her neighbours do something shady because she was spying on them” is sooo over done (thank goodness this wasnt titled ‘the woman across the lake’ lol). so this story definitely needs something to make it different. but its lacklustre execution is the primarily reason why i didnt like the ending. its a little all over the place and just leaves the reader scratching their heads when they close the book.like i said, it wasnt hard to me to finish this - RS is a great author. but this one didnt quite reach the high expectations i have when it comes to his books. better luck next time!↠ 3 stars"
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47207032-chelsea-humphrey,Rating 3 out of 5,"I buddy read The House Across the Lake with my sis Irina, and we ended up having identical thoughts on all the ins and outs of what makes this story so divisive. On the one hand, it's incredibly difficult to put down, even with the worn and tired set up of ""traumatized alcoholic female spying on glamorous couple across the way and thinks she sees something detrimental occur"" trope at play. On the flip side, the main plot twist is really make-or-break it for the entire story, because everything else is so recycled it felt like reading the same tale for the millionth time. In fact, even though this book promised to be one where you think you know what will happen, but don't, it did take a leap similar to 
Behind Her Eyes
 and 
Layla
, so even that didn't quite give me the gasp I was hoping to receive. Obviously this book is incredibly difficult to review without giving away spoilers, so pardon my vagueness. What you need to know going in is that there are a handful of twists, and each one comes in a different way. The format of storytelling, which relies on short ""Now"" sections, lengthy ""Then"" sections, and a final ""Later"" section that serves as an epilogue of sorts, is structured that way for a reason. Depending on how you break them up, there are multiple twists, but they can mostly be attributed to two different parts of the story, which is where most readers either love or hate it. The House Across the Lake very much feels like the blending of two books into one, which did give a slightly clunky vibe to the overall narrative and a feel that maybe too much is included, while also serving a particular type of plot twist (supernatural theme) that some readers like to know about before going in, as they don't enjoy it. Also, there is very much a dependence on the reader being denied certain information a la Agatha Christie style that ties into a twist, so if any of these things are a hard pass for you, you've been warned upfront. Personally, I don't feel like I wasted my time reading it due to the compulsive nature of the book, but I'm also glad I didn't have to spend $28 on it either. Verdict? I'd make it a library request if possible. Sager has proven he is clearly a talented author, I just think this particular book wasn't his best. *Many thanks to the publisher for my review copy."

15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 4 out of 5,"Riley Sager's latest psychological suspense thriller is infused with echoes of Rear Window, it features widowed actress, Casey Fletcher, a woman struggling to cope, taking to the demon drink to escape her pain and misery, only find her life slipping out of her control, sacked from her last production. Her torrid downward spiral is captured by the media, this is exacerbated by unsympathetic coverage on social media, this leads to her famous movie star mother pushing her to to take up residence in the family home, for the peace and quiet, at the atmospheric Lake Greene in Vermont, under the mistaken belief that alcohol will be harder to obtain there. The lakehouse does not provide the much hoped for solace, but armed with her binoculars and the inevitable drink, she finds her interest snagged by the couple in the house across the lake. They are the wealthy tech businessman, Tom Royce, and his beautiful wife, the former model Katherine.The glamorous perfect couple's facade begins to fray when Casey ends up rescuing Katherine from drowning in the lake. The two woman start to get to know each other as they edge towards becoming friends, but when Katherine disappears, given what she has observed, Casey is suspicious at this turn of events. This propels her to seek the truth as she investigates in this intriguing narrative with its twists, there are odd happenings, and the novel ends up venturing into surprisingly unexpected territory. This is a fast paced and entertaining psychological drama, there is the requisite unreliable narrator, but it does require a suspension of disbelief to get the most out of it. I recommend this to Sager fans and to others who enjoy psychological thrillers. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC."

 Mixed feelings galore!The basic plot is not original and has been done many times before. An alcohol fueled woman at her window giving her binoculars a workout, swinging them around from room to room, watching inside the half glass house across the lake.This time it is Casey, a widowed actress who is staying at her family's charming little ramshackle lake house. Her mom calls daily to check in on her and always asks if she has been drinking. She always replies, ""Of course not."" She is lying though, even the glassy eyed moose head mounted on the wall seems to taunt her, like everyone, it is judging her too.I was so excited when I began this book. I raced through the pages trying to figure out the twist, preparing to be blindsided, laughing out loud at so much of the mad as a hatter insanity!In the end, I struggled with the plot device used, the disappointing reveals and the conclusion. Maybe if I had known the direction the narrative would take, I would have enjoyed it more. supernatural angleI listened to most of the book and the narrator was just okay. The male voicing seemed a bit forced. I had the ecopy and only read maybe 15%.Even with the struggles, I absolutely did enjoy it because Sager's writing style, sarcasm, jokey jokes, and settings just thrill me every single time!P.S. Casey, please stay far, far away from Lake Greene in the future!"
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41321285-ltj,Rating 2 out of 5,"“The House Across the Lake” by Riley Sager starts out pretty interesting but as you keep reading, it starts to drag on. I felt several chapters going back and forth between “Before” and “Now” were repetitive. It took way too long for a real plot twist to actually happen as this was a slog to get through between the 20% - 70% mark of this novel.I felt that many situations involving the main protagonist’s drinking adventures, Casey, could have been truncated to make this novel tighter and a better read. A lot of these situations kept repeating themselves and honestly felt like fluff to me. This novel could have easily been about 100 pages shorter and it would have been a better reading experience. It starts out creepy, fizzles out tremendously for a huge chunk of the novel, and by the time things get creepy again, it happened a lot later than it should have.When it comes to the dialogue and conversations between characters, I also noticed that a lot of things continued to be repeated again to the point where I started to get frustrated because it’s a recurring theme. I’m all about a great story and the development of characters, but why explain a situation and then have that same situation repeated all over again in dialogue? I kept saying to just get to the point already and again, stop dragging things on.Don’t worry, I won’t ruin anything for you but towards the end when things finally got interesting, it does get boring because again, Sager keeps fleshing the obvious out to the point of no control. I wish things were edited down a bit and made sure that every word counted, not elaborate on every little thing three or four times over just to add more pages for the sake of adding more pages.When it came to the ending, I also felt it was unrealistic considering what went down with the lake and what eventually gets revealed. It’s like reading two different stories when it would have been better to simply stick to the creepiness of the lake and run with that, not trying to jam in something else that didn’t really need to be added in. It just felt very unbelievable and took me out of the reading experience entirely, which I’ve dealt with in the past with Sager in “Survive the Night” with unrealistic situations and endings that would never, ever happen in the real world.Overall, I give “The House Across the Lake” by Riley Sager a 2/5 as I did enjoy the plot twists but they came way too late. I wish more was explained about Lake Greene to really wrap things up and not have all this fluff that just made for a mostly boring reading experience. I should have learned from “Survive the Night” but make no mistake about it, I am done with reading anything Sager writes from here on out."

Casey, almost always under the influence, starts watching her and her husband with a handy pair of binoculars. Then, the former model goes missing…DUN DUN DUN!The first part of the story has been told many times, but author Riley Sager does an amazing job of keeping the tension high and the pace fast……until about halfway through when a twist occurs that is pretty implausible with little explanation. Such a disappointment. Ugh! The ending was satisfying though, and it was entertaining overall. I’ve loved every OTHER book by Sager. According to my scientific calculations, I was supposed to love this one. I didn’t. Yet, it was a vast improvement over Survive The Night (his last novel).

If meant to be serious it may have jumped the shark in the last 25%.The book opens with a storm raging and Casey demanding answers from a tied up suspect. Then the story alternates between ""now"" and what happened in the days leading up to this turn of events.Casey, a disgraced actress, is spending time at her parent’s lake house on Greene Lake, the same lake where her husband drowned a year ago. She spends her days in a bourbon haze, and out of boredom, picks up her binoculars and becomes intrigued by the glamorous and famous couple across the lake, Katherine and Tom Royce. But is she really spying? After all, isn’t social media an acceptable form of spying? (love that analogy!)One day, she sees Katherine floating motionless in the lake and saves her from drowning. They strike up a friendship, and Casey learns that Tom and Katherine’s marriage is far from perfect. When Katherine suddenly vanishes, Casey is certain Tom has killed her. Casey, along with her hunky neighbor, Boone, investigate on their own when the police fail to take her suspicions seriously.I have stated many times that I’m tired of boozy narrators but this time I wasn’t bothered, because Casey is not an unreliable narrator and I never once thought she was imagining things. There are shades of Rear Window, a favorite movie of Casey’s, so this is hardly a new theme. If you think you know where this is going, you are wrong. At 75%, the story takes a turn with a surprising revelation. Depending on your perspective, the story then either jumps the shark, or takes a brilliant turn. This is where I thought the author was having a bit of fun with a mash-up of genres, and books/movies that have been done before. The twists and turns come fast and furious, and kept me flipping the pages. And chuckling. Was it supposed to be funny? Apparently I wrong read it as a campy spoof so I found the ridiculousness humorous 🤷🏻‍♀️In the afterward, the author calls it a bonkers plot, and he is right. I can’t say I was a fan of the direction the story took but it kept me entertained and is not likely to be forgotten, so for that 3.5 stars. A new Sager book is something to look forward to every summer, and while I hope next year’s is not quite so bonkers, I’ll definitely be reading it."

Spoiler warning!

Brandon's review

Around this time of year, I always get excited because a new Riley Sager book gets released. The premise of this newest book sadly, did not sound that unique, but I’m a sucker for these types of books that take place on lake getaways. I turned my thinking cap on with bated anticipation to see what twists get thrown my way and try to solve as many as I can. Spoiler, I don’t solve them all.  Casey is a mourning alcoholic trying to cope with the death of her husband by staying at her lake house. In actuality, she is exiled to her family lake house by her mother after making a drunken scene in front of a crowd of paparazzi (Casey and her family were quite famous in showbiz). Having grown up at the lake house, she knows all of her neighbors until a new celebrity couple move into the house directly across the lake. She also gets surprised when it turns out her next-door neighbors have a dashing stranger house-sitting for them. Casey finds herself spying on the new neighbors while having a drink, frequently. Things go awry when the super model wife goes missing in strange circumstances not long after Casey saved her from drowning. She believes the husband to be complicit. Add to the fact that multiple women have disappeared from the surrounding area over the years means that something isn’t adding up.  A lot of Riley Sager’s books change between two timelines almost every chapter, but this endeavor consisted of multiple timelines while mainly following only one with rare switches in-between. It seems that Riley Sager is a bit of a cinephile since there are references to older movies and TV shows in this book, and numerous references in the last book he released. I do like the prose in most of Riley’s books since they grab my attention without letting go through the book. It is simple yet engaging. This book also featured a larger cast of characters that are developed more compared to previous books. Casey’s background though was told instead of shown a lot where she goes on this long inner monologue explaining her own backstory for many pages.  Casey is more developed than the previous main characters in Riley’s other books, but at the same time she feels just like all of the other main characters in his novels. Casey did feel more complex with different motivations and traumas that impacted her personality with her biggest flaw being an alcoholic. When I say alcoholic, I mean drinking to keep her demons at bay constantly. I felt that her alcoholism was excessive as it was always brought up with her needing a drink and getting drunk at all times of the day. Again, the supporting cast was well-developed, where I thought Katherine was more compelling of a character than even our main character. Boone though felt like a character trope more than an actual character.  There were a couple of red herrings in this book with some more obvious than others. As per usual in a Riley Sager book, there were a lot of twists. The biggest twist for me was only a twist because of the content of the author’s previous works under this pseudonym. Be forewarned, spoilers are ahead:  The fact that there was a supernatural aspect in this book took me by surprise as Riley Sager has never included a supernatural aspect before since some other books of his would fit the concept better. I know he has written about the supernatural in books published under a different name, but he never included it under this pseudonym where his twists were always lodged in reality. The whole supernatural aspect felt kind of weird to me in this context. I guessed pretty early on that good old Len actually was involved in the other disappearances. What I didn’t expect was for the local legend that Eli told to actually be true and involved Len in the end. I also kind of figured that Eli either was involved in the actual killing of Len or complicit in helping Casey, but instead he was used as a red herring. Boone and the detective friend of his were obvious red herrings, but I don’t know if I would trust him around stairs as he was caught in other lies (I don’t trust the story about his wife). I was surprised though about Tom at the very end considering what went down in the confrontation at the other house. My running theory was that Katherine was a super fan of Casey’s and had a mental disorder causing a split personality. Nope. The author went with the supernatural route.   I did enjoy the book and did like the author’s writing, but I felt this book and his previous book were some of his weaker entries. Certain things such as an aspect of the big twist and the constant drinking of the main character took me out of the story at times. Overall, I had a positive experience and recommend this book to fans of his previous books and fans of horror, thriller, and mystery genres. 

Cora's review


3.5/5 stars
People who know me know I’m a relative newbie to the mystery/thriller genre. I tend to go for nonfiction and sci-fi/fantasy reads. However, I am always willing to try recommendations from friends and coworkers. On the recommendation of Brandon, I gave The House Across the Lake by Riley Sager a try. A decent read, but there were a few quibbles of mine that prevented me from giving it a full four stars. Brandon gave a good overview of the plot in his review, so I won’t rehash that too much here. He’s read a few more of Riley Sager’s books than I have, so he has a better idea of what the author’s writing style is like, and I trust that he gave a good synopsis of the book with that knowledge in mind. Nonetheless, Sager did a decent job of deploying red herrings that kept me utterly confused for about half the book and then dumbfounded at some of the twists. The dumbfounding being bad and good. I figured out some, but there were others that took me by surprise.Speaking of surprises, I did not suspect Casey’s involvement in all of this as much as I should have. Casey was the one that killed her husband Len, who she found was a serial killer that had claimed the lives of three local women.  I did suspect every other character in the book, including Katherine herself. That aspect of not knowing who to trust and constantly hunting for clues may be the appeal for many people that enjoy this genre, and I can see why. Now, for the bad. I was a bit disappointed in the supernatural element that reared its head in the last half of the book. To me, relying on this kind of element is lazy, when the more interesting thing is trying to figure out the people involved, their motivations, and how they played their part in the mystery song-and-dance. Getting supernatural elements involved muddies things up too much for me and helps to spoil any of the appealing realism in the story. That probably is just me and my reading tastes here speaking, but I guess I prefer my mystery/thriller without any monsters or ghosts or the like. Lastly, another quibble of mine involves characterization and tropes. (Mostly looking at Boone, here.) Boone felt like a shallowly written character laden with tropes. An ex-cop, in recovery himself, also widowed, and hot (of course).  Perhaps I am being a bit unfair on Boone here, but the author playing on reader suspicions that he may have had something to do with his wife’s accidental death was the most depth I saw invested in him.  It just seemed like most of his identity and personality followed well-trod tropes, and I would have liked to see his character more fleshed out. Overall, The House Across the Lake was an okay read. Not the worst, but not the best.-CoraFind this book and other titles within our catalog."
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27304766-kay,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5⭐I took a chance with The House Across the Lake after seeing many low ratings for this book. I enjoyed Survive the Night while most friends didn't so maybe that's the case for this one as well. The House Across the Lake is a 70:30 mystery:supernatural with a nosy neighbor snooping with binoculars in one hand and a glass of bourbon in another. It's told in ""before"" and ""now"" format. It's mid-October and Casey Fletcher is recuperating at her aunt and mom's lake house. Casey is a troubled actress and a widow. Her husband drowned in this very dark water at Lake Greene in eastern Vermont. It's off-season and with nothing better to do, Casey keeps an eye out across the lake watching the Royces. She rescues the former model neighbor Katherine Royce from drowning and they form a friendship. When Katherine vanishes, Casey is determined to find her. This book feels very cozy to me and I can't really pinpoint why. Maybe it's Casey's narration or the handsome handyman ex-cop? I think if you go in knowing it's a mystery with a teeny supernatural part, you might not be disappointed. Nothing scary, nothing gory. I was surprised by the reveal.My major issue is the audiobook narrator. Bernadette Dunne is a wonderful narrator (We Have Always Lived in the Castle, The Haunting of Hill House, Memoirs of a Geisha) but she's not the right voice for a 35-year-old actress."

26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27057530-jasmine,Rating 3 out of 5,"I thought I had The House Across the Lake figured out, but alas, I did not. Casey Fletcher, a widow and notable actress, has retreated to her family’s lakeside cottage to escape some recent bad press. She spends her days drinking and using her binoculars to spy casually on her neighbours. Casey spends her time spying on Katherine and Tom Royce, her beautiful and wealthy neighbours. Their newly developed house sits directly across the lake from her cottage. When Katherine vanishes, Casey is determined to uncover the truth behind her disappearance. Casey is the typical unreliable female narrator that readers see a lot of these days. Namely the main character with a drinking problem that noses her way into everyone else’s business. Usually, this type of narrator would be irksome to me, but in this case, it wasn’t. I think it’s because the reader knows at the outset that Casey’s husband recently passed away, so she’s just processing her grief. Sure, it’s not the healthiest way, but still.I’ve read a few of Riley Sager’s books, and this one is slightly different from those. It started off as what you’d expect, but then it completely veered off course. If you’ve read any of my previous reviews, you’ll know that I don’t mind OTT - give me all the drama and theatrics. But this twist was just a bit too weird. It didn’t ruin the book for me, but it was an interesting way to go. I will continue to read whatever Riley Sager publishes. His books are compulsively readable and always keep me entertained. 3.5Thank you to Dutton for providing me with an arc via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. https://booksandwheels.com"

I’m sure this addition to Sager’s work will be divisive, due to a fun little twisty twist he threw in there, but for me-it made the book!

28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108004301-l-a,Rating 4 out of 5,"This psychological suspense thriller comes in waves of twists and surprises. Touching on Rear Window, which is referenced in the book, and Woman in the Window, the main character is an alcoholic with an incredible set of binoculars. Casey is a widow and stares out at the dark and eerie Lake Greene where her husband drowned. She was once an active theater star until the loss of her husband. Now she finds herself in tabloids capturing her out of control behavior. Casey's mom is a well known film star and is embarrassed by her daughter so she bans her to their family's secluded lake house without alcohol and away from the limelight. A lot of alcohol is delivered by a sweet little neighbor, so some of her stories may seem like the alcohol is talking and she is an unreliable source. With her new found freedom, she sits on her porch with binoculars and spies on the neighbors across the lake while she drinks. Tom, a tech guru and his wife, Katherine, a famous model live in the house. When Casey captures some sketchy movement in the house, she begins to suspect their marriage isn't right. One day as Casey is sitting on the porch she sees a body floating in the water. She jumps in her boat to rescue this person. She realizes it is Katherine and saves her. Not long after that, Katherine disappears. This is when the story picks up pace and strange occurrences happen. Not to mention a gorgeous man staying in a few cabins away introduces himself heating up the pages. I loved watching Casey make silly mistakes and all up in her neighbors' business. She takes the movie Rear Window to a whole new level. I could not wait to get this title and it did not disappoint. There was an iffy, unbelievable scene, nevertheless it was worth the change up. Thank you NetGalley and Penguin Group Dutton for this title in exchange for my honest review."

31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/151231754-dan,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book had very mixed reviews. I tend to be drawn to polarizing material, so I figured what the hell. I’ve been reading a lot of deep, emotional writing. This looked fun and more of a, dare I say, beach read…but it is not that.Starting out with a Taylor Swift quote is…a choice. Casey’s self-awareness is completely refreshing. She knows she’s a wealthy, successful, functional alcoholic—and she owns it. Casey with Boone is really funny. When they have the binoculars and are spying on Tom with the bag - “What’s he doing???” “Opening the bag.” There's good comic relief. There are surprises galore—ultimately too many to warrant this earning a 5-star rating. Riley could really do with reading some Pinborough, Zunker, or Modglin. Twists and turns, but not too many to make the reader dizzy. And not such a wild premise to begin with. But, I digress…It's not at all what I was expecting…in a good way, mostly.I realize it’s Vermont, but it's still a bit unrealistic that no one there has a firearm.The ending is quite topsy-turvy but does connect the dots. The author wrote himself into multiple narrative corners, so the conclusion feels too neat. A bit trite and horror-story cliche."
32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60964126-ceecee,Rating 4 out of 5,"4-5 starsRiley Sager is a must read author for me and in this one he transports us to Lake Greene in Eastern Vermont for a kind of ‘Rear Window’ (with references made several times) meets ‘The Woman in the Window’ experience with some added je ne sais quoi. Successful actress Casey Fletcher meets ex-supermodel Katherine Royce when she saves her from drowning. Katherine lives in The House across the Lake, a modern all glass feature which is opposite Casey’s much older family property. Now Katherine is missing and Casey is determined to find her doing whatever it takes to do so. Casey narrates Then and Now, how reliably only time will tell. Interspersed are some very evocative lake pictures. So, grab your binoculars and take a good hard look at the lake house as you too could be shocked and surprised. Wow. Again. I did so not expect what I’ve just read as Riley Sager jolts me out of my preconceptions and how. Fool me once, fool me several times! There are some excellent twists and I’m sure my jaw hits the deck with a resounding thump on more than one occasion. Yes, sure, some require the donning of the infamous disbelief suspenders as they’re so, well, unexpected! I’m surprised how much I enjoy the direction it takes so I go with the rapid flow. The characterisation is excellent. Casey is a young widow at 35, to say she’s struggling is an understatement as she takes deep dives into the bottom of a bottle or three and some of her issues are conveyed well. The other characters are fleshed out and you chop and change about where to place your trust. There’s so much tension between some characters at times the atmosphere could be cut with a knife especially as the author builds the mystery layer by layer. The setting is superb, the deep unsettling waters of the lake mirror the dark chills and fears that unfurl and with few to view the black deeds. The weather matches the approaching human storm with the impending and actual arrival of Storm Trish. Overall, this is a very different, surprising, entertaining and enjoyable read just as I thought it would be. With thanks to NetGalley and especially to Hodder and Stoughton for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar,Rating 2 out of 5,"It looks like this may be the release that has everyone saying what I’ve been saying for quite some time when it comes to Riley Sager . . . . 

The problem is he’s just not a very good writer and he literally has zero original ideas. I know, I know, the old saying is that there are no more original ideas, but this fella has made a career out of being a copycat. From regurging out retellings of The Amityville Horror and Rosemary’s Baby and jumping on the bandwagon of final girl stories, I keep picking his new releases up expecting him to finally write something of his own. But sadly that once again was not to happen. This was an obvious shout out to Rear Window, which just so happens to be my favorite film of all time (as well as a super shorty short story It Had To Be Murder). I’m telling you I loooooooove modernizations and can’t get enough. Sadly, Sager here opted to make a copy of a copy and really went in with full gusto on The Woman in the Window with a boozehound unreliable narrator who would have had to have her stomach pumped by noon on the daily. And then I remembered even  that has already been done (and better) . . . . 

This entire thing was problematic. From the main character having no personality whatsoever aside from being a drunk, to the nearly plagiaristic scenes (example below):As I bring my gaze back toward the house, sliding it past the back patio strewn with dead leaves and the bare trees on the lakeshore that they’ve fallen from, I notice something on the Royces’ dock. A person. But not just any person. Tom. He stands at the end of the dock, spine as straight as a steel beam. In his hands are a pair of binoculars, aimed at this side of the lake. And at me.To the non-existent pacing and story development where nearly nothing happened until the 70% mark and then fizzled right back out by 80% - this was a real dud. But you know I’ll read his next book because . . . .

This was coupled with 2 important questions I needed answering, so on I went……Casey is one of the people staying in one of the houses around the lake. There’s not many. And most can’t be seen by just looking across the lake. Casey was married, her husband died. She’s been comforting herself in drink. It’s become a bit of a problem. It will also become a bit of a problem for you, yes you, the reader as she’s isn’t a reliable source and she’s the main character! Casey plus her binoculars make for a great read! The chapters go through Before and Now. If you have the physical book it’s fab as each chapter is defined by a picture of the lake.I did notice a bit of a change in Riley Sagers writing in that he over explained some actions, I don’t think us readers read without our imagination so some sentences were a bit “omg gawd” moments.It didn’t distract me too much just “here we go again” .For example:-“I rush out of the bedroom..Passing emoty bedrooms on the way…beds unmade”Um, there is only her staying in that house on the lake so I reread it several times and felt it was unnecessary as to some other examples too.Again it didn’t go as far as spoiling my enjoyment.Because…….I’m loving the tension…We gradually get to know more about Casey and the intriguing actress across the lake whose married to Tom. That bit was hooking me to read more and more.But good things hardly come out of peeping at neighbors especially with binoculars.Is Casey paranoid?Is she still suffering from grief?Is it the bottles that are messing with her mind, the drunken stupors she finds herself in?Oh boy. Page 251 was a cliffhanger, the tension. I couldn’t go to bed I needed to read more.Things toward the end took a strange odd twist. Is this sci-fi, sceptical realism?Was the author drunk when he wrote this bit? Did he party with Casey!I was thrown.Unbelievable.But nontheless it kept me reading, reading with disbelief and my mouth open. WHAT.I was also momentarily confused. Some contradictions.I reached the end.I said to my husband what I had just read and he said “that’s clever really”“Hey what?”“That will make you remember this book in years to come BECAUSE it was weird and stood out to you because on the whole you enjoyed it, yes?”“Yes”And do you know what.

40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39272121-marilyn-trying-to-catch-up,Rating 3 out of 5,"3 generous stars. I was excited when I saw that Riley Sager had written another book. His previous books appealed to me and I enjoyed them. I was hoping that The House Across the Lake would have some of the same elements of suspense and some twists and turns as his previous books had had. The House Across the Lake started out good. The plot drew me in almost immediately. I easily got involved in the well plotted storyline and found myself interested in the developing characters. Somewhere about midpoint, though, things started going downhill for me. When Riley Sager introduced supernatural elements into the book it took me by surprise. The plot became almost silly. It was hard for me to listen to the audiobook from that point on. I was expecting twists and turns and moments when I had to hold my breath to see what would happen next. Instead I was met with a disappointing turn in the plot. I found myself rolling my eyes and asking myself, what was Riley Sager thinking? The beginning and ending saved The House Across the Lake from being completely disappointing. This was my least favorite of all his books, though. I listened to the audiobook that was well narrated by Bernadette Dunne. Casey Fletcher was at her family’s summer home in a remote part of Vermont. It was located on a big beautiful lake and there were only a few homes on it. Casey had recently lost her husband to a drowning accident. She had turned to alcohol to numb her feelings of loss. Casey was an actress and so was her mother. Acting and alcohol weren’t a good combination, though. After totally embarrassing herself and the cast while trying to act while being totally intoxicated, Casey’s mother felt it would be best for Casey to lie low for a while until all the negative publicity died down. Thus, Casey packed her bags and found herself on Green Lake with lots of time to continue drinking. Alcohol was the only thing that made Casey’s time at the lake bearable. After all, it was on this lake that her husband had drowned. Then one night Casey was sitting on her porch when she thought she saw a body in the lake. Casey got in her boat to see what or who it was. It ended up to be one of Casey’s new neighbors. It was the super model wife that had moved into the house across the lake from her. When Casey finally got her into her boat she was sure she was dead. What happened next surprised even Casey so much. One moment she thought her new neighbor was dead and the next moment she miraculously opened her eyes. Casey began to fear that the husband of the super model might have had a hand in the almost drowning. Then the super model neighbor disappeared. Super sleuth Casey began taking matters into her hands. She ignored all the advice to stay out of this investigation but Casey couldn’t help herself. She was determined to figure out what happened to her new neighbor. Casey could had never in her wildest dreams imagined what had happened to her neighbor. You won’t either and you might not want to know.The House Across the Lake by Riley Sager was disappointing. I enjoyed the beginning but the middle turned me off. Luckily, the ending tied together some of the loose pieces and brought closure for some of the characters. Except for the middle section of this book, I enjoyed listening to The House Across the Lake. I hope Riley Sager sticks to what has worked well for him in his past books when he contemplates writing his next book."
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara,Rating 2 out of 5,"ARC received in exchange for an honest review.Recently widowed, Casey has escaped her high profile life as an actress by spending time at her secluded lake house. With little else to do, she's taken to watching her neighbours, the retired supermodel Katherine and her tech husband Tom Royce, across the lake. And the more Casey watches, the more obvious it becomes that Katherine and Tom have far from the perfect marriage. So when Katherine mysteriously disappears one night, Casey takes it upon herself to investigate. But she might uncover more than she bargained for. I'm really not having a good time with Riley Sager these days. Although the atmosphere and build up for this were good, especially the scenes with Casey in the Royce house and the tension this creates with an obvious homage to Rear Window, it suffers a lot of the same problems that Survive the Night had for me. The characters are all deeply unlikeable, especially the female protagonists. Casey and Katherine don't really feel fleshed out or well developed, falling back onto the tired trope of the unreliable female narrator who drinks too much and has major personal issues. The story doesn't try to do anything new with this trope, and quite honestly I just found myself bored for a lot of the plot and didn't care about the characters. The only saving grace is that it was fast paced. My other major issue, which is a bit of a spoiler, is that the supernatural elements go largely unexplained. You can't introduce such a massive fantastical element into the plot without any backstory to it otherwise it just feels unfinished and used only for shock value. I don't like supernatural elements to thrillers. I find it makes the plot twists lazy, and honestly if I wanted something fantastical I'd read a fantasy. I can't suspend my disbelief without a valid reason.Disappointing, but if you liked Behind Her Eyes by Sarah Pinborough or Layla by Colleen Hoover you'll probably enjoy this. "

But it did for this one it was that bad. - alcoholism is not something that just turns off and on. Which is the way it's written in the book. - also how does a woman drunk out of her mind, have such coherent and ""smart"" thoughts. Smart is relative. But she literally goes on journeys and figures stuff out like 12 drinks in. Just a no. - too many red herrings. At some point enough is enough. I like a decent amount of red herrings but this book had literal plot lines that made no sense besides to ""trick"" the reader. - oh wow a hot handy man who we are gonna talk about how hot he is all the time... cause that's what woman do .......... (Sager can we please stop using this, can we get a hot something else next time at least. The handyman needs to be retired)- HOW SMALL IS THIS LAKE? How are we seeing all this stuff, how are we getting across in a boat so fast? Like I have fancy binoculars I could not creep into my neighbours house with them on my lake and it's small. OR RUN AROUND IT in like 10 minutes. I think this book should accurately be renamed ""The House Across The Pond"" And drumroll please...Let's not even talk about that ""twist"". I was already not having a good time with this book before that. But as soon as those words escaped this book and that twist happened. I knew there was no coming back.

I was really looking forward to it because I normally have a lot of fun with Sager's books, but it just felt lacking in one too many ways. First, I could not connect with the main character at all. She was so boring, one-dimensional, and her decisions were completely reckless and nonsensical. The plot itself didn't really start getting anywhere until about 60% of the way in, and by then, I almost didn't even care anymore. I was just hoping the end would make up for the ""slow burn"" beginning. All of the twists (while surprising) happened in the last maybe 20% and the supernatural element just did not work for me. Overall, not what I was hoping for but I don't think it's a terrible book. If you read a lot of thrillers though, you might find this one difficult to suspend disbelief enough get through."

As with all of his books, it was such a binge read, I just needed to know how it was going to end. If anyone guesses that ending they must have magical powers I swear. I did not see it coming at all and it was gasp out loud moment. I love a good thriller and The House Across the Lake is amazing. If you loved Rear Window then you will love this wild and crazy mystery. It is Rear Window on steroids - seriously. A grieving widow who uses alcohol to cope with her loss. This widow also happens to be a famous actress. Spending some time in her house on Lake Greene to hid out from the press. On the other side of the lake is another famous couple, former supermodel Katherine Royce and her husband Tom. Just as they start to get friendly, Katherine goes missing. With the help of her husbands bird watching binoculars she has been keeping an eye on her neighbours and their goings on.So of course our drunk main character decides to investigate her friends disappearance. Nothing could go wrong with that could it? Ha ha. There is a lot more to it than that but no spoilers.

50,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6970586-denise,Rating 2 out of 5,"Here I am all Debbie Downer, but this is the second Sager book in a row that has not thrilled me in the least. In fact, more than once while I was reading it, I was counting the pages until the end so I could just be done with it. 35-year-old actress, Casey, has had very public fall from fame; and her mother sends her to the family lake house to get her life together. Easier said than done though as this where Casey's husband drowned the summer before. Casey finds herself bored and drinking more than ever to hide her grief. Until she happens upon her husband's binoculars and decides to take up spying on her new neighbors across the lake, Tom and Katherine. What she sees though convinces her that Tom has killed Katherine, and she makes it her mission to prove it. Ultimately, nothing is what it seems, and everyone on the lake has hidden motives.I liked the setting, but that was pretty much it. Perhaps it is because this is the second thriller in a row where the protagonist(s) is a weak, constantly-drunk female, but I am more than over this trope. Unreliable narrators come in all manners, so to constantly make them alcoholics and/or pill-poppers is just lazy in my opinion. The plot just didn't excite me either. For much of the first half, nothing really happens at all - other than Casey's excessive drinking and binocular binge spying on her neighbors. Also, maybe it's just me but it seemed like at times, Casey had x-ray vision, not binoculars, into Katherine's house - there is no way she could have seen the things she describes in such detail. Also, I loathed the supernatural element - it was senseless and felt like a copout in every way. I was mildly interested in one of the twists, but then the ending was just so ridiculous, it negated my interest.I have always loved Sager's books, but this one is definitely my least favorite. I'm likely an outlier with my opinion, but it wasn’t for me. I will say though that my family has lake house and the thought that someone across the lake might be constantly watching with binoculars is creepy and unsettling - thanks, Sager. 🤦‍♀️ "

But if you drink too much, for too long, all those well-meaning people in your life who try to understand but can't eventually give up and drift away.…She, too, has officially grown tired of my bullshit. The only surprise, really, is that it took her this long.Following her husband’s death a year earlier, and a professional embarrassment soon afterwards, former actress Casey Fletcher is slowly drinking her life away in her family’s Vermont lake house. One day, she saves her new neighbor, former supermodel Katherine Royce, from drowning. As they become friends, Casey starts using her husband’s old binoculars to peep into the titular house across the lake owned by Katherine and her tech mogul husband Tom. After seeing that their marriage is not as happy as they present, Casey suspects Tom of foul play when Katherine disappears.On some levels, The House Across the Lake is classic Riley Sager. There are the horror movie tropes, especially and obviously to Rear Window, which Casey expressly talks about at one point. Left I discussed are the significant similarities here to  The Girl on the Train. There’s psychological suspense, too, although I found the first half of this book to be pretty slow. Casey may have good reasons for being an absolute mess, but being inside the head of an absolute mess is kinda exhausting after awhile. And then, of course, there are red herrings and the twist.Will you guess the twist at the heart of The House Across the Lake? I doubt it. Does that mean it’s a good twist? Not at all. I thought the big twist here was pretty ridiculous. And once it happened, I had a pretty good idea of where the rest of the story was going. And that’s the risk of this type of novel; if the twist doesn’t work there’s really no salvaging things. A disappointing read."
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115229580-justin-chen,Rating 4 out of 5,"4 starsIntentional or not, Riley Sager has fully converted to writing 'thriller parody' with The House Across the Lake, and I'm not mad about it. Historically, I've always held the opposite opinion regarding his novels, thinking they are try-hard at best, pretentious at worst, and grossly over-praised by the bookish community. But starting with Survive the Night, there was a noticeable stylistic and attitude shift — the novel finally admits it is just junk food for the brain and fully embraces its silly campiness.The same can be said regarding the overall tone of The House Across the Lake, which is a self-aware, flashy parade of exaggerated genre stereotypes: an hilariously alcoholic female protagonists (the word 'bourbon' pretty much shows up on every other page—is this book sponsored?), a Rear Window style, 'spying on thy rich neighbor' plot, a mysterious hunky man next door (aka the potential love interest), and a Sarah Pinborough-esque reveal (because it was such a hit in Behind Her Eyes), presented here with more gusto, but even less logic. There's no trace of originality, yet everything is presented with a seasoned author's polish and well-timed storytelling, and extremely bingeable. I went into The House Across the Lake expecting it to be a leave-your-brain-at-the-door fun time and NOT the potential best thriller of 2022, so I ended up enjoying this for the same reason others who found Riley Sager's latest disappointing: the familiar plot, the trite but endearing characters, and the nonsense reveal. Overall I appreciate how upfront it is regarding its trashiness — Riley Sager aimed for a Lifetime thriller movie, and wrote one spot on. **The Book Troop Book Club July 2022 Selection**"

This is though, had my psychological thriller meter, going back into the read. Unlikable characters are not enough to do me in, and there was plenty of suspense, a few surprises, so why didn't this appeal? For one I didn't think the plot and its being compared to Rear Window, did it much favor. It wasn't that tightly constructed. But the biggest reason was because the author didn't take me where he wanted me to go. To suspend belief enough to buy into the resolution. I simply couldn't go there.Other readers have enjoyed this more than I. Read other reviews before deciding whether this book might be for you."

But then Sager beat me with his words over and over again with twist after twist until I finally relented. Not only did I like it, but I LOVED it. Maybe I'm drinking the Sager juice here.This goes in a wild direction. Judging by the polarizing reviews, it certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea... or bourbon, in honor of our MC Casey Fletcher. I know readers are tired of drunk MCs, but I thought Sager authentically captured the effects of alcohol.

That being said, the story focuses on Casey Fletcher, a widowed actress who has received criticism in the media by her behavior following her husband's death. Casey is trying to live a reclusive life in rural Vermont at her family's house where she drinks away her grief, but after saving her supermodel neighbor Katherine from drowning, her life is forever changed. Katherine and Casey forge a friendship where subtle clues about Katherine's marriage begin to worry Casey, especially after disappearing after a fight with her husband. I have to give praise to the author for continually entertaining with his writing, because the book is actually really well written. I just feel like this book, just like Survive the Night (which I really enjoyed) have been stories already told. I can't deny that this book is fun and will entertain readers, and I will say that I appreciated the author's journey into a different kind of twist. I will still read books by the author, but I would appreciate if the author chose to change the types of protagonists that he uses in these books. "

But I really enjoyed this one. Lots of twists and turns--some predictable, some not. Casey, our protagonist, was interesting, smart and inciteful when she wasn't blackout drunk. All in all a pretty standard Sager novel.  "
61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9711335-mallory,Rating 5 out of 5,"Was this the most believable book I’ve ever read? Nope, not even close. Was it a fun ride I devoured in a day because it was fun in the way cheesy horror movies are? You better believe it. I like Riley Sager and find his work to typically be pretty entertaining. I liked the twists in this one and I have to admit I didn’t see them coming. Casey is recently widowed and treated her grief with alcohol which led her to lose her acting job and end up all over the tabloids. She’s laying low at her family’s lake house in Vermont, where her husband dies. She sees a woman drowning and saves her but can’t help but watch her and her husband across the lake when things start to go a little funny. The story goes from before to now until the two timelines converge and was really an entertaining read. Overall I give it 4.5 stars rounded up for entertainment purposes. "
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/160741281-shawnaci-schroeder,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5/5 ⭐️- Really enjoyed the pacing of this book!! If a thriller can keep me invested with the pacing, that’s one of the most important things to me! It’s also very rare that I actually become invested in the characters of the thriller I am reading, usually in only invested in the plot but I really loved the main character in this so much. Not because she was perfect, because she most certainly wasn’t that.. honestly she was a bit unbearable at times, but she just seemed so incredibly HUMAN which I loved.- I think my least favorite part of the book was the twist at the end. I feel like the last few chapters were just pulling out the most outlandish things ever and it all just seemed so unrealistic. - This is the first book I’ve read by this author and I immediately wanted to pick up another one because even though the ending wasn’t my favorite, I didn’t want to put the book down from start to finish which rarely happens for me! The writing was so so good and I really enjoyed the then/now timeline. The first few chapters weren’t a super fast start like most thrillers, but as I kept reading the pacing was so fast I found myself wanting to jump to the next page before my eyes could read the page I was on! Definitely would recommend!"

64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83189392-jonann-loves-book-talk,Rating 5 out of 5,"Riley Sager, one of the world's most popular authors writes brilliantly. I read every book he publishes. While it's true that I have a unique perspective as a Sager fan, I am also considering the book's target audience in my review of The House Across the Lake.Synopsis:Casey Fletcher is grieving the recent loss of her husband. Casey has the propensity to bury her sadness in a bottle of bourbon. To regain her life she retreats to the family lake house. Casey meets the seemingly flawless couple across the lake, but as she gets to know her newly found friends better, she has doubts. Something feels suspicious about the circumstance. Is anyone who they seem?The House Across the Lake captured my imagination. It is difficult to describe the plot without giving away any spoilers. If you are looking for a mind-bending psychological thriller Sager has it, but it is so much more. For Sager's work to be enjoyed, one must suspend all sense of reality and just let the story flow. The result will be a captivating journey. The House Across the Lake is gritty and intense. I was visually drawn into the book through the descriptive writing. I read many books that follow a basic thriller outline, but this novel presented a different context that I found fascinating. Sager moved the boundaries of realism with shocking plot twists. I fully understand that this book may not be suitable or desirable for everyone. Check the trigger warning before reading it. (5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)The House Across the Lake by the gifted Riley Sager is available by Hodder and Stoughton on July 7th.Thank you, NetGalley, and Hodder and Stoughton, for the wonderful opportunity to review The House Across the Lake. A special thank you to Riley Sager for the pleasure of reading your work. Your books always brighten my day.@HodderBooks, @HodderPublicity @NetGalley, #RileySager, #TheHouseAcrossTheLake"

66,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4332892-scottsdale-public-library,Rating 5 out of 5,"This novel follows Casey Fletcher, an actress struggling to cope after the death of her husband. After losing her job in a play, she’s staying at her family cabin on a sparsely populated lake. She meets her new neighbors, Tom and Katherine Royce. Casey makes a connection with Katherine, and, after getting a glimpse into her relationship with her husband, is worried when she suddenly vanishes. Convinced Tom is behind the disappearance, and not satisfied with the response from the authorities, she takes it upon herself to find out what happened. What Casey doesn’t realize is that she has it all wrong, and what is going on is stranger than she’d believe. A definite page turner, this book keeps you engaged and is effective at the plot twists it has. It is hard to imagine anyone seeing the plot twists and guessing where the story ends. Multiple times during reading, one will think they know where the story is going, and guessing at potential reveals, but the story will go in a different direction. This is a novel perfect for those who enjoy thrillers but are adept at seeing plot twists and reveals coming. Engaging and full of twists and turns, readers will enjoy the ride this story takes them on. - Madeline C."

68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3908840-sue,Rating 4 out of 5,"THE HOUSE ACROSS THE LAKE is the sixth psychological thriller from Riley Sager. Having loved “Final Girls”, “The Last Time” and “Survive The Night” that I have read from this author, I am anxious to start his latest novel. Now after finishing this novel, I plan to catch up and read “Lock Every Door” and “Home Before Dark”. I am very impressed with his writing and having the other novels on my Kindle to read, I must make the time to complete his works.Casey Fletcher, a grieving widowed actress, and the daughter of the world-famous theater actress Lilly Fletcher, is an alcoholic as a way to cope with her loss of her husband, Len. In order to hide out from the press, she has retreated to her family’s lake house in Vermont, on Lake Greene. Here, Casey passes the time drinking and spying with a pair of her husband’s binoculars, on her neighbors, across the Lake, Tom and Katherine Royce. Tom is rich and Katherine is a former supermodel.One day on the lake, Casey saves Katherine from drowning, and the two start up a friendship. But the more they get to know each other—and the longer Casey watches—it becomes clear that Katherine and Tom’s marriage is not as perfect as it appears. But then Katherine suddenly disappears without a trace. Casey becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to Katherine but soon uncovers some very dark truths hiding just beneath the surface.Casey is convinced that Katherine’s husband, is plotting to murder her…The format of the story is divided into sections of “Now”, “Then” and “Later”, which provides depth and understanding to the novel. The beginning of the book is very slow-paced, but stick with it as things soon change.There is a lot more going on in this story and I will not say too much as I don’t want to spoil it. Exciting gripping read with interesting characters, psychological suspense, and a shocking twisted ending; I did not see coming. Highly recommend!Many thanks to the author, Hodder and Stoughton and NetGalley for granting my wish to receive a digital copy."

It reads like a standard box-ticking exercise in domestic thriller clichés (alcoholism, unreliable narration, marriages undermined by sinister secrets, etc.)…Until it then goes completely off the rails in the third act an ends up being a celebration of all the bullshit Sager’s previous works actively critiqued. I get that Survive the Night was fun-bad for some, but with this latest *disastrous* entry in Sager’s oeuvre, even his most fervent devotees should be skeptical at this point."

The protagonist in Riley Sager's latest is an alcoholic woman spying on her neighbors. The wife goes missing, and she decides to investigate.I'm keeping this as vague as possible. There are a few fantastic twists in this book, but one of the big ones I had figured out very early on, then I was annoyed with myself for ruining the surprise. Ha.I thought the pacing was a bit slow during the first half or so, then things got kind of wacky. THE HOUSE ACROSS THE LAKE was entertaining for the most part, but it was no HOME BEFORE DARK. That one scared the crap out of me, and I loved every minute. (Borrowed from the library.)"

So 3.5* is not a bad rating at all but when I tell you I was expecting to LOVE this book. I really was expecting to love it. In reality, I was impatient to get to the end and dare I say I got a little bored at points. Like we get it she's an alcoholic 😭 I also wasn't expecting the twist to be that unhinged as I just didn't think it was that style of thriller. Maybe booktok ruined this for me because it's so highly rated over there or maybe I've read too many thrillers at this point but, yeah. Wasn't my favourite"

74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james,Rating 4 out of 5,"Another winner. Riley Sager is definitely top notch at thrillers. While I'm not always keen on the paranormal angle that appears (as in this one), the actual plot and twists make up for it here. Clever storytelling. Mesmerizing descriptions. Not my favorite but still a good character study. Two more to go and then I'm current!"
75,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5990485-mary,Rating 3 out of 5,"Oh Riley Sager, why did you have to go and do that? Anyone who knows me knows I am a huge fan of Sager and will forever read his books. More often than not, I adore them, and they take me on a wild ride like no other. Well, The House Across the Lake certainly does that, but between Casey's excessive drinking (The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window anyone?) and the ridiculous twist, I just could not get behind this one. It also probably didn't help that that audiobook was truly terrible. I don't know who chose Bernadette Dunne to be the narrator, and goodness I hope it wasn't Sager, but they need to be fired. As a narrator for another book, she would be amazing and there is NOTHING wrong with her, but for this book? absolutely not. She sounds way too old to be Casey, and because of that was just another reason this book was ruined for me.Knowing what I know now about the twist and the audiobook, I may end up trying to read The House Across the Lake as opposed to listening to it and see if that helps my feelings towards it. If you take out the most unbelievable twist I've ever seen and Casey's drinking to excess, the rest of the story was quite interesting to me. It was fun watching her spy on her wealthy neighbors and I was really into the mystery surrounding Katherine's disappearance. The amateur female sleuth is one of my favorite tropes and Casey is one that just won't quit. I am also a huge fan of the illustrations in the physical book and thought they were a nice touch. While I may not have loved this one, there are plenty of people who did, so I highly recommend READING (not listening), and finding out for yourself what all the fuss is about.I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own."

77,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14045562-amy,Rating 5 out of 5,"Riley Sager is a polarizing author, I have friends who rave over his books and others who think he’s overrated. I’ve enjoyed all of his books, some more than others but this may be my favorite yet! If you read the synopsis that may surprise you because it seems like the plot follows the same overdone script we’ve seen so many times before. But not everything is as it seems and things get flipped around so much I don’t think many could say this didn’t have a fresh take on a tired trope. Because of this unique spin I really think the less you know the more you’ll enjoy this because a huge part of the fun for me was the wild ride. I will say that despite there being a slow burn feel it read really fast for me still and the atmosphere was creepy too. All in all I thought it was a super entertaining summer thriller that I think will once again divide readers, I don’t see a lot of middle ground here, I think you’ll either love it or hate it. I loved it and can’t wait to see what everyone thinks, I’m sure it’ll be discussed quite a bit this summer."

If you've read my reviews for a while, you know I hate to write negative ones, but I really can't find much to redeem this book in my eyes. The premise really intrigued me, and I will say, the setting was well illustrated, but boy did that turn into a slog! It felt very repetitive very quickly, and then the ""twist"" came and the eye rolling began. I can't even tell you, without spoiling it, but if you're looking for clever plotting and logic, look elsewhere. I'm afraid, most of Riley Sager's books have not lived up to the hype for me, often feeling too outlandish in their resolution, with big, gaping potholes of logic flaws peppered throughout. So, I think this will probably be my last one by the author. Onward and upward, a new year of reading is just around the corner!"

Sounds familiar, but Sager manages to subvert expectations and really flip the genre on its head in a way that would spoil the fun if I shared anything more about the book. Go in knowing as little as possible and enjoy the ride!"
80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34742660-chelsea-thrillerbookbabe,Rating 3 out of 5,"Thank you so much to Dutton for Riley Sager’s newest thriller. This was a mix of Rear Window and The Woman in the Window, but on steroids. It is the classic trope of an alcoholic woman spying on her neighbors, not really sure if what she sees is real or fake. Casey is a recently widowed actress staying at her lake house to avoid publicity. When she meets her new supermodel neighbor while saving her from drowning, Casey becomes obsessed with watching them through her binoculars across the lake. She sees there is tension in Katherine’s marriage and when Katherine disappears, Casey fears the worst has happened.Thoughts: Now, by that description you are thinking you’ve read this story before. It’s the traditional and overdone trope of an unstable woman who sees something no one believes. And it was…for a while. I found myself getting a bit bored with the build up because it was everything I thought it would be. The setting was fun, the narrator was unreliable, and the supporting characters were suspicious. However, at around 70%, everything changed. Because it’s Sager, I knew I would enjoy this book no matter what. He is an amazing writer that draws in the reader and writes fast-paced and intriguing stories. This book was NOT what I thought it would be. I kept thinking I knew exactly where it was going, but I really really didn’t. There were so many twists during the last 30% of the book that I had to put everything I was doing aside and barely took a breath. It was so wild and unexpected that I didn’t know what would happen from one paragraph to the next. There was so much in those few chapters that I wish it would have been spread out more throughout the book. It was classic Sager- lots of build-up, phenomenal writing, and some great twists. I know that some people will be blown away by this book and fall in love immediately. It was good, and for fans of wild endings, I think you’ll love it. 3.5 stars for me. "

82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5877123-helen-power,Rating 3 out of 5,"Quick Review: It really pains me to give a 3-star rating to one of my favourite authors. :(Full Review: I, like most other Sager die-hard fans, have very mixed feelings about this book. The first two-thirds of the book is very familiar. The general plot has been done so many times before. An alcoholic woman sits in her window watching the couple across the lake, and when the wife goes missing, the heroine becomes convinced that the husband did her in. The plot is clearly inspired by Rear Window, and, unfortunately, a good chunk of the book did not have an original spin on this. But then there’s the twist. At first, I was amazed. It was such a clever and shocking twist that floored me. The book is told in two timelines, with the “Now” timeline giving us little snippets of what’s currently happening, and the “Before” timeline taking up most of the narrative. Once that twist happened, I was absolutely taken aback by how brilliantly Sager had misled the reader in the “Now” timeline, and I’d been convinced of very specific things that were clearly misdirections. Unfortunately, Sager did not take this twist in the direction that I was expecting. I don’t want to spoil this for readers, but if you’ve read other Sager books, you’ll know that he generally follows the typical script of thrillers. He doesn’t deviate too far from genre norms, or dip into other genres. The twist in this book requires a huge suspension of disbelief, one that he could have prepared the reader for with more thoughtful writing in the first two thirds of the book. Instead of preparing the reader to be absolutely stunned by the nature of the twist, he should have been laying the ground work for readers to find that type of twist more palatable. All this said, Sager does have a fabulous writing style, and I was sucked into the way that he describes the setting, the lake, and the faded movie star’s tragic past. But that just wasn’t enough for me.It pains me to give this book 3 stars, because Riley Sager writes like no other and, as a writer, I get serious imposter syndrome every time I read his prose. I love his use of metaphors and description, and he writes heart palpitation-inducing scenes like they’re going out of style. I absolutely love his writing, and I (usually) love his plotlines and clever twists. I feel like I would have enjoyed this book a lot more had I been forewarned that he was going to be going in a completely new direction.

83,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/844081-christina,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book took a well-trodden, Rear Window-esque plot and gave it several totally original twists -- one too many twists, in my opinion, but still a very enjoyable ride.I listened to this book on audio and at first thought the narrator sounded too elderly and cozy to be the young starlet Cassidy at the heart of the book, but eventuallyI lost myself in the good performance.This book is about how people who live in glass houses shouldn't murder their wives. Or is it about something else entirely? Anyway, at the beginning it's about the couple in the glass house. Cassidy lives on Lake Greene and one day she has a meet-cute with Katherine, the supermodel who lives across the lake. Well, I guess it's not quite a meet-cute when you save someone from drowning in a lake. Cassidy realizes that the woman she has saved is the world famous supermodel with the reclusive husband who has moved into the fully transparent house across the lake. Predictably, soon Cassidy can't quite help herself from snooping on Katherine and her husband Tom with binoculars. At the beginning I was cynical and thought this would be a derivative Rear Window knock off, and lord knows I've read enough of those in the last few years. But no! This book is much more creative and thrill-packed than those others. Though the plot starts off predictably -- of course, in spying, Cassidy witnesses a weird and scary fight and soon after that, Katherine disappears -- it soon has several unexpected twists, almost all (but one) of which I enjoyed. But perhaps more interestingly, in unraveling what happened to the missing model, we go on a wacky and wild journey into Cassidy's own life, which features a history of alcoholism, a dead husband and a life as a troubled starlet, though the shocking events were not necessarily in that order. And we soon learn that though Katherine's husband is the prime suspect, almost everyone in the book -- including Cassidy -- has secrets of their own. I loved the first 70 percent of the book, which was fascinating and compelling and total five-star territory. And I loved the twists and turns UNTIL we suddenly veered into the supernatural. This twist for me took things a little too far into ridiculousness without quite explaining enough why the supernatural event had happened. Nevertheless, Sager is a fantastic, fun and compelling writer and he soon had me fully invested and along for the ride. I enjoyed the book's ultimate conclusion. I think this would have been a five-star book for me without the supernatural twist, because the characters (especially Cassidy) and the rest of the plot without the supernatural aspect was so compelling. The supernatural part was a bit of a letdown, but the book was still a very fun four-star romp, securing Riley Sager as an auto-read author for me. I like a creative and daring writer who takes weird and wild chances, and Riley Sager sure doesn't mind jumping into crazy, thrilling ideas feet first. I look forward to seeing what this twisted mind comes up with next"

I actually enjoyed the beginning seemed to have a promising story coming. It just was mundane at best. Now I see why there are so many low ratings. I would just stick to the other Riley Sager books if you're new to them, skip this one so it doesn't put you off from reading the good ones."
85,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7275200-audrey,Rating 5 out of 5,"I am going to own my Riley Sager super fan status out of the gate and don’t even have the words for how excited I was to get an ARC of THE HOUSE ACROSS THE LAKE.I’ve read all of Riley Sager’s books (some of them twice) and will say that he 100% shocked me and got me with this book. Well, well, played.I’m a fan of going into thrillers blind so will keep my plot overview vague. This is all the Rear Window vibes on a lake. Our main characters, Casey Fletcher, is a famous and recently widowed actress who had an infamous public breakdown caught by the paparazzi that have been her devoted followers…waiting for her to take a misstep. In order to escape the bad press Casey retreats to her family’s home - a secluded house in Vermont - and now spends her days downing drinks and picking up a pair of binoculars. Casey quickly becomes fascinated with the new couple - Tom and Katherine - who moved into (you guessed it) the house across the lake. Casey believes something is not right in their marriage and she becomes obsessed with finding out more.I love how Riley Sager dances in familiar trope territory in his books - final girls, summer camp horror movies, haunted houses - and how he twists and plays with the reader’s expectations. I find that I often think I know what I’m getting…think I know what may happen next…or have expectations based on the tropes, but Sager finds new and inventive ways to play on these tropes and to keep me guessing, to surprise me and more than anything to keep me reading way late into the night.I have read his books in order and FINAL GIRLS has stayed in the top spot for years. While others have come close (and I do love all of his books), I will say THE HOUSE ACROSS THE LAKE is the first book that threatened to unseat it and keeps a top spot in good company as my fave Riley Sager novel.If you are not already reading Riley Sager this is a great of a place as any to start. His books are all standalone but I loved the Easter eggs he planted here for his readers. And unrelated to the story, I secretly hope Casey was named as a nod to JB Fletcher. Huge thanks to Riley Sager, Dutton and NetGalley for the ARC. This made my whole year!"

87,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7373580-jen,Rating 2 out of 5,"You know, I really thought nothing was going to be worse than ""there are movies in my head"" from Sager's last (Survive the Night) but boy oh boy did he manage to top it. Not a fan of the (absolutely ridiculous) twist but more than that, I'm just plain angry at books that lie to the reader for a good portion to create a twist. 2 stars instead of one because this could have been a serviceable thriller if it had gone another direction with the ending. I told myself I wasn't going to read another Sager. I did it anyway. There is no one to blame but myself.Edit/update: Read further at your own risk as the comparison I'm about to make would constitute a spoiler for The House Across the Lake if you've read the other book.Okay, so I haven't actually read Layla by Colleen Hoover (and never will), but I just watched a litcrit of it and... hmmmm. Of all the authors to be taking plot inspiration from, we're picking CoHo?"
88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2345422-kristen-kraysbookclub,Rating 2 out of 5,Sooooo…this book is the spawn of The Woman in the Window and the movie Fallen (w/ Denzel Washington- read the premise and then roll your eyes and the blatant meshing of these two plot lines). And this main character lady couldn’t be any more defined as an alcoholic. The entire story is a nonstop recap of her daily drinking which barely lent itself to any part of the plot. I’m surprised Sager didn’t have her just reside in a bourbon barrel with a straw adhered to her mouth. This book was ridiculous.

The story was gripping and the twists unimaginable, but they were only unimaginable because I didn’t know the book would have certain genre aspects that I can’t say because I guess it’s kind of spoilery? 🤣It kind of felt like cheating.Having said that, I enjoyed the characters' voices and the writing style. It felt immediate and stressful. I'd like to read more from this author. "

91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10269122-gina-adams,Rating 1 out of 5,"Thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for an early copy of one of my most anticipated books of 2022!Ummmmmm............ there's times in life where we swing and we miss Riley tried to put a new spin on an old trope with this one and it was so painful...The trope is very played out already: a woman with trauma drinks too much and spies on her neighbors. It's a tired concept. Exhausted, even. We know how these stories go. She drinks because she can't cope with her trauma, she has pushed everyone away and is painfully lonely, she meets her female neighbor and gets overly attached after one night because of lack of human contact, then she spies on her neighbors just to feel something and is shocked to witness something alarming while spying. Did I just describe The House Across the Lake or The Woman in the Window? Or an entirely different third book? I mean, there's literally that new Kristen Bell show on Netflix with the title that parodies all these books that are the same: The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window lol and that sums it up better than I can. They're literally all the same and ARE they demeaning to women? Mostly written by men, about us drunky stupid overly nosy little women who are gaslit into complicity by men, with their addictions cited as the reason their eyes *had* to have deceived them? Maybe that's a conversation for another day, but keep it in mind.Plenty of people use substances (and abuse them) as a means of dealing with trauma. Plenty of women. So it's not that, not wholly. But it's becoming an archetype that I see as potentially harmful, especially coupled with the whole ""I was really drunk, so maybe I *didn't* witness a murder after all!"" concept. But, anywho, Riley tries to subvert expectations by introducing a twist. This twist was DEFINITELY stupid, and verging on just painful. I kept thinking, just because you're an author, doesn't really give you the room to write ANYTHING you want. Lmaooo I mean you obviously can, but it doesn't make it make sense or flow with your narrative just because you want to say it. The twist was such a forced ""I bet you won't see THIS coming"" and it was so out of left field that it was actually at the tennis court two blocks over.And of course the twist twists back at the last second, in a sort of Friday the 13th ish vibe, and even that was anticlimactic.I'm just sooooo unimpressed with this book that I was so excited to love, and I'm mad because I broke my reading slump for THIS?????????? This is serving more Are You Afraid of the Dark on Nickelodeon than anything that's actually meant to be thrilling... and that's actually an insult to the old classic. Idk man, read it if you feel like it, because I know Riley Sager's releases are kind of traditional to all of us at this point, but if he continues on this decline (last year's Survive the Night was my 2nd least favorite from him after this one) I'm gonna have to find a new thriller bestie to latch onto "
92,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61626866-summer,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ever since Riley Sagar’s debut novel The Final Girls, I’ve read every single one of his books upon the year of its release. So as usual, when his newest work arrived, I dropped my insanely long tbr stack and immediately started reading.The House Across The Lake centers around Casey Fletcher who is an actress and the daughter of the world-famous theater actress Lilly Fletcher. Casey has recently become an alcoholic as a way to deal with the sudden loss of her husband Len. To escape the prying eyes of the tabloids, she has retreated to her family’s lake house in Vermont. With little to do in Vermont Casey passes the time with bourbon and spying on her neighbors, Tom and Katherine Royce. Katherine who is a former supermodel suddenly disappears without a trace. Casey becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to Katherine but soon uncovers some very dark truths lurking just beneath the surface. The beginning of the book is very very slow-paced, and if I'm being completely honest I was even getting bored. But trust me you want to hang in there and keep reading. The beginning has full-on Hitchcock’s Rear Window vibes(the movie is even mentioned in the book). We are introduced to Casey and her history as well as an introduction to the neighbors. Without giving anything away, I will say that 50% of the way in the book starts to get very very interesting. As a jaded thriller reader who can easily predict the twist or reveal, I was actually blindsided when the twist was revealed, and in true Sagar fashion, we are hit with multiple blindsiding twists. Not that I disliked it but I ended up enjoying this one much more than last year's release, Survive The Night. This is such an unforgettable story that will stay with me long after finishing it. There is no doubt that The House Across The Lake will be loved by Sagar’s fans and will be one of the biggest thrillers of the year among readers. The House Across The Lake will be available on June 21! A massive thanks to Dutton Books and Netgalley for the arc in exchange for an honest review! "
93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75009563-rachel-hanes,Rating 3 out of 5,"(2.5 stars) So this was different… Oddly enough, I started off really enjoying this book- I have a thing for drunk, unreliable characters. And our main character, Casey Fletcher sure fit the bill for that! But then this book took the weirdest, most bizarre twist at about 80% in, and it just lost me. Like why?! 😫The House Across The Lake takes place at Casey Fletcher’s lake house in Vermont. There we meet Casey’s neighbors, either through conversation or by spying on them through binoculars 🤫. All this while sipping on plentiful amounts of scotch or bourbon 🥃, all through the comfort of the front porch rocking chair (it really doesn’t get any better than that now does it?)Then the beautiful model from across the lake goes missing, and here is when things really start to get crazy for Casey at the lake… All I can say without giving away any spoilers is that this story had the potential to be really good. The bizarre twists near the end just ruined it for me. Some people may like it, some already have liked it. It just did not work for me. My recommendation going forward is to pour yourself a nice strong drink like Casey Fletcher, because trust me, you’re sure going to need it after this one. 🍷"
94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28438082-provin-martin,Rating 5 out of 5,"Kasey Fletcher grew up on the lake. She and her cousin Marnie spent many summers swimming and staying up late at night telling ghost stories. But Kasey grew up and as she did the lake became more occupied. Wealthy people were moving in and things were getting weird. Casey and her husband decide to move to the lake and see if the lake life was for them. But then one morning Casey’s husband’s boat is found floating alone on the lake and he is nowhere to be found. Once his body is recovered and his services have been held, Casey has her own mental breakdown. Her mother forces her to return to the lake (where her husband died) and expects Casey to have a full recovery from all her problems, including her new drinking hobby. But that’s not gonna happen. Especially after she makes drinking buddies with the new rich people across the lake: one a tech millionaire, and his beautiful former model wife. This book has an amazing amount of jaw dropping twist and eye popping secrets. You’ll never know what’s going to happen on the next page. A perfect summer read!"

What I will say is that I did feel like there were some pacing issues. It felt like there wasn't much happening in the first 70% or so of the book. That was my first issue, though it probably would have a 4 star rating if that was my only minor qualm. What dropped my rating on this one was actually the ending. It got a little wild there, in a way that was unexpected, and I'm not sure how I felt about it. There was some suspension of disbelief that I needed. That's all I'll say so as not to spoil anything! Overall, Riley Sager is one of my all time favorite authors and has been since right when his first book came out, and I've rated every other book of his 5 stars. While this one wasn't my favorite I will still eagerly read anything he writes, and I already can't wait to see what he comes up with next! "

I’m fucking tired of reading books that are full of every single stereotype that society has created & believed about me, a woman. I’m fucking tired of reading books by male authors who continuously write female protagonists who are “stupid”, “unstable”, “unbelievable”, “clueless”, “need protection from a male in order to survive”, “alcoholic or addicts for no reason whatsoever”…..the list goes fucking on.I’m sorry for the language but books like this one make me feel SO embarrassed. I’m so tired of seeing women, even fictional ones, being written about in such an insulting & humiliating way. I’m over it. Male authors need to either do better, or stick to what they fucking know, which is men. Like most of our society. Women will never truly be understood, especially with shit like this.How dare you try to include ONE sentence about how “hard” it is to be a woman. How unsafe we feel. How we constantly have to look over our shoulders. Wow, that one sentence really made me believe in your compassion & empathy. How dare you make your female protagonist an unstable, alcoholic. Wow, where’s the originality there pal? There is none. & PLEASE tell me how the book would have been different if you took away her alcoholism? IT HAD NO POINT. There was no added benefit to doing that to her. Except…to discredit her. Like women are constantly being discredited every single day for simply existing. You don’t get it. Women are constantly being written in books this way so the author can seem they like they are trying to be “relatable” - like they sympathize with us for being ~women~ when in reality, they just have no fucking idea. Nor will they ever. Especially if they continue to only see us in THIS way. Sager, I’m tagging you in this post. Because this isn’t the first time you’ve written your girls this way but man, do I hope it’s the fucking last. Male readers, I ask you: do you enjoy these books because to you, these characters seem normal to the idea of women you have inside your own mind?Women, aren’t you fucking angry, too? Cause I sure am.1/5 ⭐️ "

She isn't sure, but will stop at nothing to find out.Riley Sager always knows how to suck me into a story and this proved no exception, despite my somewhat lukewarm reaction to the outline. I've read synopsis similar to this one numerous times before, yet this author took the reader on a path I could not have predicted, with plentiful reveals that varied in shock factor but were all unguessable, and a final destination to the narrative that mirrored all that came before in the organised chaos involved in it."

I could picture it all, the beautiful lake and the stunning setting. I know a lot of other reviews complained it was similar to another book, but I love the original Rear Window and many of the remake movies for it. So I've loved the remake books as well. But this one had amazing twists that made it all its own. And I loved the twists. They were such a new and interesting spin that it made the story feel new and refreshing, like a new thriller I didn't already know. The ending was a shock and played out well. I loved it all. "
99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8542123-meags,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 StarsI haven’t read many Riley Sager books yet, but I’ve enjoyed what I have read immensely. His thrillers are well-paced and addictive—the kind of stories you lose time over, whipping through each page, eager to see what will happen next. Initially, I worried The House Across the Lake would feel too reminiscent of The Woman in the Window, sharing more than one commonality in terms of plot and character that definitely gave it the same vibe when the story first began.However, my worries were unwarranted and this story quickly branched into a world all of its own, keeping me gripped to the page and frantically attempting to predict what would happen next. As many reviews have stated, this one took a road less travelled within the contemporary suspense genre, taking a different kind of turn in the second half that was both unexpected and surprising. Some readers haven’t (and won’t) like some of the turns this story takes, plot wise even genre wise, but if you go in with an open mind, you shouldn’t be too blindsided.Having said that, being blindsided by the twists and turns in this one—for which there were several, as is only right in a Riley Sager mystery—made up for most of the fun I had reading. It played out like a vivid movie in my head: fun, moreish and enjoyable as all get-out.For sheer entertainment value, I place The House Across the Lake in my top slot, as far as 2022 thrillers are concerned (so far)."

Thrilling, addictive, perplexing and full of twists, The House Across the Lake is another champion piece from Riley Sager.The House Across the Lake follows Casey Fletcher, a widow suffering from a career and personal life crisis. When Casey decides to retreat from her stressful life at her family’s tranquil lake house, she gets more than she bargained for. In between her endless glasses of bourbon, Casey is distracted by a disturbance at a house across the lake. When Casey spies some unusual behaviour from a couple in the house across the lake, she wonders if what she is seeing is truth or is her mind playing tricks on her?I’ve now read five out of six books written by the master of psychological suspense Riley Sager. As a super fan of Riley Sager, thanks to novels such as Lock Every Door and Survive the Night, I was eager to experience this The House Across the Lake as soon as it released. I made sure I grabbed a copy of The House Across the Lake as soon as it hit bookstores! Overall, I have to say this was a good read, but it didn’t quite match my love for Lock Every Door.There was something familiar about The House Across the Lake as soon as I opened the book and was introduced to the main character. Casey Fletcher is a woman consumed by grief and the loss of her career. Drowning sorrows in alcohol and other people’s lives, Casey takes solace in involving herself in the events happening across the lake. However, this lands Casey in hot water when she spies something sinister happening right on her doorstep. The resulting series of events are perplexing, shady, mysterious and questionable. Casey’s life does read much like the typical unreliable narrator we have come to know through popular books such as The Woman in Window and The Girl on Train. I enjoyed Sager’s spin on this trope, but I think I came to the conclusion that The House on the Lake was not my favourite book in the Riley Sager collection. However, I did enjoy the latter half of the book that picks up after a slow burn start, it definitely compelled me to turn the pages quickly.The House Across the Lake is a problematic thriller that will take you down some dark routes thanks to the flawed main protagonist. Those who love a good domestic suspense tale will be sure to enjoy this one."
101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7154927-oceana-gottareademall,Rating 2 out of 5,"This did not turn out how well for me.This follows Casey who is an alcoholic widow. She and her mom are both well known actors, so the alcoholic binges have made for some bad press. Casey’s mom sends her to the lake house -where Casey’s husband died- to keep her out of the press and hopefully find closure. Casey meets the couple in the house across the lake and starts spying on them with binoculars. She sees things that are suspicious and the story goes from there. I liked the premise well enough but right away I found Casey to be super unlikable. When a character is unlikable to me, I don’t care what happens to them. Like I was prepared for Casey to be dead at the end and I wasn’t phased by that. I liked that there were reveals throughout the story rather than all at the end, but the final “reveal” was soooo dumb to me. Like really? That’s what it is? Not into it. Not for this kind of story. I prefer plausible explanations, not *spoiler* 🙄It was clean and there were a few f-words, but they didn’t stand out. It was the story I didn’t like in the end. I���m still going to read Riley Sager because I loved Lock Every Door and Home Before Dark. Those books have plausible explanations! That’s what I want in a thriller/mystery. Wouldn’t recommend. "
102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44279580-tracy,Rating 3 out of 5,"Riley Sager's 'The House Across the Lake' is my least favorite novel by Sager to date. That being said, it was fun and intriguing for much of the book. Unfortunately, it was too far-fetched and out there for my taste. It is definitely creative and I found all the characters interesting - and with great back stories. I am glad I listened even though it was initially hard for me to get used to Bernadette Dunne's narration. After a short time I came to appreciate her voice - especially for alcoholic main character, Casey Fletcher. It reminded me of Carrie Fisher's tone-of-voice when she was about the same age as Casey, and their similar battles with the bottle. In the end I thought she was the perfect choice as the solo voice."

104,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17371689-kimberly,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars.THE HOUSE ACROSS THE LAKE, by Riley Sager, started out a bit slow (and got quite redundant with several parts) in the beginning, but began to come together much faster after the halfway point.
""What is marriage but a series of mutual deceptions?""
Casey Fletcher, former actress, lost her husband to drowning at their summer/vacation home 14 months prior. After this, her casual alcohol intake has become full-fledged alcoholism. In an attempt to keep her out of the public eye, Casey's mom (a MORE famous actress) sends her to the vacation home until she can get herself back together.Sure, because being at the place where your husband died is just the perfect solution here.I have to admit that I didn't care for it very much in the beginning. Not Casey, herself, but the way she was portrayed. Unreliable female narrator, and repetitious scenes too numerous to count: take a drink, sit on porch, get more to drink, sit on porch, another drink..... I got the idea after the first 20 mentions.The other characters were well fleshed out enough--although one just felt like he was thrown in there for a ""love interest"", which was as dull as they come.It wasn't ALL bad, however. After a little more than halfway, things took a turn for the ""better"", in my opinion. I wasn't able to predict things at this point, which made it all the more interesting.
""Memories, though, are a different matter. They're filled with ghosts.""
The last 2/3 flew by, and I really enjoyed the execution of it. The idea interested me, and it was something I never saw coming in this manner. If the author had this approach from the beginning, as opposed to the MC simply drinking and spying, I would have rated this book more highly."

But unfortunately, not in a good way. I picked this book up, as the author was someone I have heard a lot about and never really read a book from. The cover is beautiful too, which always is the way I decide my next read - it was really nicely done and to my liking :)About the book itself... To start with, I did not see this book labelled as fantasy or sci-fi or occult/folk-come-to-life, but it was, which I found strange. For the first 20%-30% in I was indeed interested in this book and loved the secluded lake location, the cosy atmosphere, and the plot progress. Then, the plot twistens... where do I begin? I found it did not make sense in order to accommodate all the twists and turns, the start of the book did not fit it. It just did not make enough sense for me to believe it or buy the explanations. And then the repetitiveness.. oh my goodness, please! I got it the first time it was said. It did not feel like the author respected the reader enough to allow them to figure anything out by themselves, which I also do not enjoy.The characters I found not only unlikeable but also unbelievable and unrealistic.And the ending... I would not call it twist after twist, I would call it convoluted. Just.. nope. All in all, this was not the book I thought it might be and could be. in all honestly, a lonely-lake-creepy-neighbour suspense thriller without anything paranormal and without all the craziness would be much much better!

Z początku wszystko w „Domu po drugiej stronie jeziora” zapowiada opowieść w duchu klasyki Hitchcocka – porównanie do „Okna na podwórze” narzuca się tutaj samo. Przed oczami mamy też migawki z „Kobiety w oknie” A.J. Finna czy „Dziewczyny z pociągu” Pauli Hawkins. Przewijają się motywy podglądactwa, wojerystycznej obsesji, przesiadywania z lornetką i zaglądania prosto w cudze życie. Wszystko to podkręcone przez alkohol, przez uzależnienie, które mąci zmysły, mąci umysł, sprawia, że obrazy mogą być prawdziwe, a wcale nie muszą. Wszystko to już było, wszystko to dobrze znamy… Ale czy na pewno? Sager usypia naszą czujność podrzucając pod oczy to, co znajome, co wygodne, co rozpoznawalne. Do czasu.Przyznam, że ja te twisty, tę zabawę i grę motywami uwielbiam, przepadam za nawiązaniami, za sagerowymi zaczepkami. Wiem również, że przy lekturze jego książek trzeba zachować czujność, nie pozwolić na zmyłki i odwracanie wzroku. „Dom po drugiej stronie jeziora” to znakomity przykład opowieści, która nie jest tym, czym obiecuje być. Jest czymś bardziej, czymś więcej, czymś, co wymusza na czytelniku uwagę i szczegółową rewizję własnych oczekiwań. To zresztą nic nowego w przypadku twórczości Sagera, ale to również sprawia, że nie każdemu z Sagerem będzie do twarzy. Na co trzeba się przygotować? Na POZORY!"

Actress Casey Fletcher is staying alone at the oldest house on the lake, built by her great-great-grandfather. Casey's mother sent her there after an embarrassing public drunkenness episode onstage. Not sure why this was a good place to retreat since Casey's husband drowned in the lake a year ago. Casey has taken his death really hard so she drinks, drinks, drinks, then drinks more. As Casey sits on the porch drinking, she spots a woman drowning. She boats out and saves former model Katherine Royce. Katherine and her husband Tom live in the mansion directly across the lake.

Then Katherine disappears.I have eagerly awaited every one of Riley Sager's books since The Final Girls about 5 years ago. I was into the story for maybe 100 pages and then it slowed down a little. So here come a couple of big twists. One, I didn't expect. One, I did not care for at all. I don't read the genre it seemed to become. Now, I love a book with twists and here they are so I can give credit and that's the only reason I rounded up instead of down. Was this book as good as previous ones by this author? Not for me. Was the book worth reading? Yes. I think it's a solid 3.5 even if I didn't like part of it."

Anyway, he can enjoy my own ""cancelled"" jail alongside fellow inmates Peter Swanson & Lucy Foley. He may get out on parole but he will have to write a hit."

An absolute stonking read.Casey a disgraced actor who has lost her husband to a drowning accident retreats to the family summer house by the lake to escape the press and appease her mother. Fired from her Broadway job for being drunk, its the only place she can escape to, despite it being the same lake that her husband lost his life in less than a year ago.That tragedy has Casey reaching for the bottle to take away the pain, the bottle that eventually cost her career and is her only friend in the isolation of the house on the lake.One day while out on the porch drinking bourbon she spots a body floating on the lake and rushes out in her boat. She pulls the body from the lake but the woman appears dead. Eventually the woman springs back to life and Casey finds out that she is a famous supermodel and herself and her husband have bought the huge mansion on the other side of the lake, the one with the big glass windows, one of only five houses on it in total.When Casey finds a pair of old ""birding"" binoculars that belonged to her husband, she decides to look out through them and scan the lake as she gets them into focus. She stops on the supermodels house and notices she can see into every room at the front of the house when it is dusk as it is all glass.The more she watches the more she is convinced that something isnt right in the marriage and that maybe the husband isnt all that he seems and may be trying to kill his wife!Thats sort off the gist of it. I just loved loved loved this one. More than a nod to Hitchcock, this one will have you feeling uneasy, laughing at the fun of it and finally rubbing your backside more than once as the carpet is pulled from beneath your feet on more than one occasion.There is just something about Sagers writing that appeals to me. There always seems to be a nod to past, be it slasher movies of here Hitchcock(although it does all go completely mental in the final quarter, in a good way). Some might find this a slow burner or be annoyed by the slightly unreliable narrator but I loved her character and she is a drunk pretty much throughout the whole book.I cant recommend this one enough. If you like mysteries, murder mysteries, horror, supernatural or thriller then there is something here for you. If you like all, like me, there is everything to like and love about this book.5 stars without a doubt.Thanks to the publisher for the ARC through Netgalley."

Casey is using her deceased husbands binoculars for voyeurism on the house across from her across the lake. Made mostly of glass, this house draws Caseys interest and attention. One day she spy's what looks like a body in the water. She rushes out in a panic and drags a lady out of the lake. This lady turns out to be ex-supermodel Katherine. After saving Katherine's life, the pair strike up an unexpected friendship, but Casey is concerned about comments Katherine makes about her husband and things she witnesses when voyeurising their house from across the lake. Many things don't add up for Casey and she contacts the police with assistance from her hot neighbour Boon. This story had such a twist I didn't see coming.

Long Review: The first 70% of this book is the unlikeable and absolutely flat main character drinking bourbon and watching her neighbors house with binoculars. It put me to sleep.All of the characters have the personalities of wet mops and we are supposed to care about their fate? That's a big, fat, bored-out-of-my-mind, no. Something needed to happen during the first 70% of the book. Something other than the main character getting drunk and snooping. Something like character and plot development. When the twists finally came, it was a case of cramming way too many tropes for the sake of shock value. The shock just didn't work for this reader. They were laughable, completely unbelievable, and downright hokey. I want the hours of my life back."

While heavily inebriated, Casey manages to save her neighbor, supermodel Katherine Royce from drowning. She becomes obsessed with watching the couple across the lake through binoculars and becomes convinced that Katherine's husband is trying to kill her. Casey realizes she is acting like the Jimmy Stewart character in the classic movie Rear Window watching their every move and fearing for Katherine. Casey is compelled to share her fears with another neighbor (an ex-cop) as well as the local police detective. And what about the three young women who remain missing from the area? Could Tom be a serial killer?In the hopes of remaining in spoiler-free land, I can only say that The House Across the Lake is more than what it appears to be. Although it is the lowest rated book from an author I truly adore, Riley Sager managed to blow my mind with several, ""What the heck did I just read?"" moments. This book has Sager's inventive twists and surprises but for reasons I won't reveal, it is quite different. I felt the book was ultimately entertaining, but for me, it didn't have the high level of appeal that his book Lock Every Door and his others had. I have to give the author lots of credit for stretching his creativity but I'm ready again for the type of book that made me an early fan.Rated 3.75 mixed-feelings stars.Review posted on MicheleReader.com."
129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55056784-jasona,Rating 2 out of 5,"What happened to Riley Sager? He went from being one of my favorite authors that consistently wrote good, if not great books, to being laughably bad. This one isn't as awful as Survive the Night, but it's still pretty bad. He's following the same career trajectory as M. Night Shyamalan; start with some good stories with surprise twists, then keep making the twists bigger and bigger to keep the audience on their toes, up until the twists become so outrageous that they become laughable. One good constant is that I don't have any issues with Sager's writing style. There's something about it that let's me easily slide into the story whether it's good or bad. I've never had issues getting immersed into his story telling. It can get repetitive at times, but not to the point that it takes me out of the book.That's about the only good I have to say about this one. The first half of the book sucks. To the point that I almost quit reading a couple of times, but I heard some people say it gets better in the second half, so stuck it out. It does get better (would have been hard to get worse), but not enough to save it. It reads more like a satire of the genre than something serious. If you've seen the Woman Across the House From the Girl in the Window with Kristen Bell on Netflix, the first half of the book and the main character are crazily close to that (the book Kristen Bell's character reads is called the Woman Across the Lake). The character isn't overly sympathetic and the story just drags and drags and drags. No twists or surprises (or much of anything else) happen until past the halfway point. When they do, they end up feeling a bit like a cheat because they're pretty far out there (to the point that we've changed genres) and the unreliable narrator is basically lying for good sections of the story. I like an unreliable narrator to a point (drunk, drugged, or otherwise mentally impaired are okay with me, but just lying is right up there with the ""it was all a dream"" in my book).I don't want to get spoilery, but I wasn't a fan of the big twist. If this were a new author or the blurb gave more info on what was going to happen, I might have liked it more. Being a Riley Sager book, I'm expecting a mystery with twists, not what we ended up getting. The whole thing kind of felt like a cop out. I understand why it happened and why Sager needed to do it (the quarterback option doesn't work if you don't establish the run and he's been faking the run a lot), but it really didn't work for me. This is another book that needed some editing to make it better. It could have been a three or four star book if a lot of the fluff and filler were cut out of it. There's no reason it took 200 pages to get to the meat of the story. You could cut fifty pages without breaking a sweat and 100 pages wouldn't be a whole lot tougher to do. I'm not ready to give up on Sager yet, but I'm pretty close. I usually stick to three strikes and you're out (what's with all the sports metaphors in this review?) and we're sitting at two strikes. The next book is going to need to be pretty good to get me back on the Sager train."

Riley Sager’s story that will stump even the most seasoned thriller reader. The equivalent of the campfire ghost story and the perfect companion for your next trip to the lake. The House Across the Lake is an eerie tale set on a remote lake in Vermont. Casey Fletcher, a recently widowed actress has retreated to her lake house for a desperately needed break from her life in NYC. Armed with a pair of binoculars and MANY bottles of liquor, she spends her day watching Tom and Katherine, the glamorous couple across the lake. One day, Casey saves Katherine from drowning, and the two strike up a friendship. The more they get to know each other Casey feels Katherine and Tom’s marriage is not as perfect as it appears. When Katherine suddenly vanishes, Casey becomes consumed with finding out what happened to her…A bit repetitive at times but overall enthralling and addicting. To me, it was everything I wanted in a eerie thriller. Have you read it? What do you think? There is no way you saw that twist coming, right?!"

When she notices the wife is missing, she’s convinced the husband is responsible.This was a BANGER. The ONLY reason it isn't a perfect 5 star for me is because the first 60%ish is a little ""long.” Some are saying it was ""slow"" leading up to the huge twist; I DISAGREE- I enjoyed the backstory in the ""before"" chapters, although it could have been a teeny bit shorter.No other complaints. Was I a bit confused at times? Yes. Was some of the plot twistery wild, & unbelievable? Yes, BUT I LOVED IT ALL. I should've kept a tally of how many times I audibly gasped! This is one that I’ll be thinking about for a LONG time. It was pure genius, in that after the big twists are revealed, SO many of the seemingly smaller details from previous chapters made so much sense.If you like fantastically outrageous thrillers..

141,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81557299-beary-into-books,Rating 4 out of 5,"Rating: 4Publication Date: 7/21/22This was a pretty solid mystery/thriller. It held my interest the whole way through and kept me questioning what was going on and wondering who I could really trust. The main character has a drinking problem which makes the reader question whether or not they are a reliable narrator. The author did a good job with pacing and not giving away the ending but having the clues there if you're really paying attention. Some things I was able to figure out and others I wasn’t but after thinking back I can see that the clues were there. The writing was easy to follow and even though the characters didn’t have much to them I enjoyed them. My problem with this book was how the synopsis makes it sound like every other thriller. I enjoyed this one because I haven’t read “The Girl on the Train” or “The Woman in the Window”. Both of those books have a similar premise in that the narrator is unreliable due to their drinking and they all witness something but aren’t exactly sure what they witnessed. That's the same exact idea for this one but this one might surprise you in some ways. I think if I would have read the other two I might not have enjoyed this one because it would have felt like the same story with a new setting. However, if you did enjoy those two then you will enjoy this one even more! Overall, I would definitely recommend this one and I really wish I could say more about it. But due to spoilers I want you to solve the mystery on your own! Try not to read reviews because you definitely don’t want to learn the twist. There is also one book that can be compared to this one that will give the twist away and I’d hate for you to learn that. Thank you so much @penguinusa for the #gifted copy on #netgalley in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own. "

I will always read Riley Sager because there are things to love, and some of them are great, but this wasn't it.We have a character with a mediocre passion for anything in life. It is hard to care for her. She isn't fully realized. She likes to drink until blackout or pass out. Her greatest moment in the book is her reveal at the weirdest point in the book. I was a bit sad that this wasn't more of a guess though, it seemed pretty evident with her coping and complete withdrawal. The rest of the characters are more like shadowy figures in my mind. None of them were brought to life very well. Then we get to the psych thriller twist. Can I just say WTF? Why? I can even get down with this type of unveil. I can get into weird stuff. My issue is with EVERYTHING else about it. There is the worst lackluster description of why and then everyone is just cool with this and goes with it. No. Just no. This was such a cheap and lazy way to expose your readers to this. IT made me mad just to read it. If you want your readers to accept this, make it believable. But I guess why do that when you didn’t spend much time on overall character development. This book could have been great but was probably rushed to meet publication deadlines and all of us as readers had to suffer with this unfinished concept.2 Stars."

With the work week, heck month so far, that I've been dealing with I needed some mystery thriller fun to spice things up. In this, you will meet Casey. She is an actress who unfortunately tries to numb all her pain with alcohol. This eventually gets her mom's attention and she's sent to family lake house in Vermont. For some odd reason, her mom thought isolation would help her not drink but the exact opposite happened.In some way, it was a nice thought because Casey really did need to leave the city for a while. Vermont was probably the worst decision because being there unleashes some memories she would rather forget. Mostly because the last time she was at this house was before her husband died. We don't know why those memories make her want to drink all day every day, but we will eventually find everything out.Throughout the book, we get lots of secrets, hints of a new romance, and some murderers to figure out. Each chapter completely sucked me in, and I had no idea who was behind it all. So, it's safe to say that I was shocked when we reached the final reveals because hot damn - I wasn't expecting them!

I was hooked the entire time I was reading this book… So much so that I was coming up with MULTIPLE theories about what happened to Katherine and how she disappeared and I was a bit off the mark but still did a pretty good job. The underlying theme of this story is Casey’s struggle with alcoholism and how she copes with her failed acting career… HOWEVER, it’s Len’s fault as you’ll see if you read it. Casey was SMART and trusted her instincts even when no one believed her in the beginning and she had a very sharp eye but didn’t always make the best choices. Loved her. TOM AND LEN YOU SUCK GOODBYE.

I love a good thriller, and he writes fantastic characters. Even in this book, I instantly liked the MC, as well as the side characters. Where this really fell short for me was the explanation at the end. It felt like what happens when you don't know how to end a story reasonably, so you start going with absurd explanations that only kind of explain the previous events.I don't think it had to be this way either. I had so many theories about what might be happening, but when it got down to it in the book, all I kept asking myself was, ""this isn't really the explanation he went with, right?"" It felt much goofier than I expected from him.I'm going to try out another one of his books, and I truly hope the next one is different.My Blog | My Books | My Twitter | My Instagram"

The narrative effectively jumps between now and then and I quite liked the main protagonist.The widowed actress Casey is an unreliable narrator having spiralled into drink after her husband's death is finding solitude in the family lake house in Vermont.She becomes friendly with the glamorous neighbours after saving former model Katherine from drowning. From there she builds a bond with her and Tom.Though she soon becomes convinced that everything isn't right with there marriage.For the most part I found this to be a really solid page turner. It was just the unexpected additional element that really took away much of the suspense.Good for about 75% of the book, which ultimately reflects my rating."

To get her to shape up, her mom sends her to their family's lake house to clear her head and sober up. Casey, unfortunately, doesn't see this as the get clean opportunity she needs. She keeps drinking and ends up not only befriending a former model, Katherine, who lives across the lake, but also becomes a bit of a voyeur as she plays Peeping Tom, spying into their home. One night she thinks she sees something unusual and the next day, Katherine is gone. She supposedly went home to NYC, according to her husband, Tom, but things aren't adding up. It definitely gives off Rear Window vibes. I'll be honest, I was done with the drunk unreliable narrator about 3 years ago, yet somehow it worked here.There were a couple twists in this book, one impossible to predict, and although I didn't love that one for reasons I can't share with spoiling the story, the journey was amazing. Riley Sager is a master, and is the only author who I've read all of their books. I will sit here patiently (not really) awaiting his next book."
158,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21987508-a-reader-obsessed,Rating 4 out of 5,"4 StarsI’m slowly digging my new foray into the mystery genre, and this one didn’t disappoint!Though I was a bit apprehensive because I didn't do too well with The Girl on the Train, this definitely promises similar undertones. The inherent problem of the MC being a drunk is that despite one’s convictions, they have no leg to stand on as everything they interpret is through a cloud of alcoholic fumes and credibility is out the door. Not only do the doubts come from their near and dear, but they themselves question what they see and experience.However, Casey surprisingly didn’t annoy me as much as I thought she would. That doesn’t mean she wasn’t often inebriated, but she’s valid in her suspicions. This was a slow build as Sagar meticulously sets the pieces in place, laying down the questions and planting dubious goings-on, making you agree with all that Casey perceives. Though one wonders if a crime has actually been committed, at 63% the axis is tilted and from then on, things progress quickly and crazily!This could’ve devolved so easily into disbelief and frustration, and for some readers that will be the case. Granted, there were times I started to side eye it because of Casey’s mindset which only added fuel to the fire, amping the anxiety and paranoia. Thankfully though, this had a twisty reveal on several fronts, and I didn’t see it coming (not that I’m purporting at all to having a knack for solving such ahead of time).My first Riley Sagar and certainly not my last!!"

It seemed never ending with her drinking, which makes her a very unreliable narrator.Casey is an actress spending some time at her lake house. She's spiraling after her husbands death and needs time away from acting. She's out on her boat and sees someone floating. Luckily she's able to rescue this woman, Katherine, from drowning. But then Katherine goes missing some days later. Casey grabs her heavy duty binoculars (seriously, this lake must not be that big to where she can see their faces so clearly, or do I just not have a good enough pair?) to watch the house across the lake because she thinks Katherine's husband, Tom, has to be involved. I gotta say I didn't see the big twist coming, so that's always exciting. Overall, not wowed, but didn't hate it to where I won't read his next book.Narration ~ Bernadette Dunne did an alright job narrating for 11 hours and 3 minutes, easy to follow at 2x, but I probably would have preferred to read this one. I'm not sure how old Casey was supposed to be, but I don't think the voice matched the character. Was it supposed to be all the drinking catching up with her giving her a raspy voice? Also, I didn't like that there wasn't an announcement of a new chapter, was it that way in the book too?More reviews here ➡ Heather Adores Books"

And, fine, I didn’t exactly hate this book. But I sure didn’t like it, especially the ending. I love paranormal books, but this didn’t need to have that in this story, imo. It ruined a lot of it for me.Overall, I found this story to be boring. I’ve finished Riley’s books practically screaming because of how many twists and turns they have. But, this? Had one plot twist I didn’t see coming that I did enjoy. This ending though, my goodness, what the heck was that?Listen, I will still recommend Riley’s books to people. I genuinely think he’s had some bangers that are worth reading. I think he’s talented and can come up with some wild plot twists. I will continue reading his books in the future. However, as for these last two novels, I have no idea what’s happened. I can only hope he comes out with other stuff that makes up for whatever mess he’s created out of Survive the Night and The House Across the Lake.Riley Sager, I’m not giving up on you.

So I chose this one. I didn’t know what it exactly was about. But I think it helped with the slump. So, in the beginning of the book, I’m sad to say that you don’t really get any actions for the first 200 pages, but then the weirdness comes in. And you’re like wait wtf?

There really isn't anything that couldn't happen.The House Across The Lake is clever at messing with your perception and is a pacy, addictive read during which I wasn't even bothered by the drunken main protagonist- a trope that normally irritates me.This is a murder mystery and a twisty psychological thriller that goes down strangely compelling paths and remains unexpected to the last.Thoroughly entertaining and fun to read with great writing and a haunting plot."

166,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29994928-rivetingreads,Rating 3 out of 5,"I have a dedicated vlog on my channel with all of my thoughts reading this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKnRV...Casey Fletcher is a recently widowed actress who struggles with alcohol abuse and has had extremely negative press attention because of this. She returns to her family’s peaceful lake home in Vermont and to keep herself occupied, begins to watch the glamorous couple living across the lake. One day, she witnesses something disturbing in the house across the lake and it becomes clear that the couple’s marriage is far from perfect. The wife suddenly disappears and Casey becomes determined to find out what happened and save her. This novel starts out one way for about sixty percent of the book and then a sudden reveal turns the whole story upside down! I felt like the first half of the book was much more slow burn than Sager’s usual writing which unfortunately made me less invested in the story. Once the twist is revealed, it was so shocking and surprising to be in a thriller but I’m not sure if I like the twist very much. I would have never predicted it but it seemed to not match the usual tone of Sager’s novels and seemed way too improbable. I don’t have a problem with suspending disbelief for plot twists but this one just felt so unrealistic to me in the context of this book. If you are someone who is irritated reading about an alcoholic who is an unreliable narrator, I wouldn’t recommend picking this one up because I think you would get frustrated. If this doesn’t bother you, I still think you should give this one a try! I really loved the location and imagery which Sager always excels at. I feel like I would have liked this a lot better if a lot of the first half of the novel was cut down. I also wanted to get to know the side characters more in this one instead of focussing so much on Casey the whole novel. Unfortunately, this is my least favorite of his books and the only book of his so far that I am rating under 4 stars. I'm giving this one a 3-3.5 star rating. Thank you so much NetGalley and Penguin Group Dutton for a copy of this arc in exchange for an honest review! P.S. Riley Sager, I need another Gothic novel from you!! Those are my favs of yours and I can’t wait to read your next book!"

I have the BIGGEST urge to read this author’s whole back list because of how great this book was.In my opinion this author has a similar writing style to another one of my favorite authors, Taylor Jenkins Reid. So if you like ANY TJR book you NEED to read this book ASAP! This book follows a woman named Casey who’s husband recently died. Because she is going through so much grief and is a (raging) alcoholic she decides to go stay at her lake house for a while. While she’s there she picks up a hobby of stalking her neighbors the live right across the lake from her (hence the book title). The more she watches the more suspicious she gets. One day when her neighbor goes missing Casey starts to get do her own deep dive into her neighbor’s husband.I flew through this book. It felt like I couldn’t turn the pages quick enough. I was FLOORED the whole time. My jaw was on the ground since CHAPTER ONE. There were so many plot twists and so many suspicious people that I literally trusted NO ONE! Not even the main character! I loved that this book had multiple timelines. The pacing was fantastic, the characters were so unlovable yet loveable (while some of them were just straight up VILE), and the suspense was GOD TIER. LET’S TALK ABOUT HOW GOOD THE FORESHADOWING WAS THOUGH- You literally couldn’t skip a sentence because there was so much foreshadowing. It made me over analyze nearly ever sentence! I was so paranoid throughout this whole book. I had every light on and closed all of my windows. Honestly, I got quite petrified during a few parts of the book!I absolutely loved Boone. He was so precious. KATHERINE IS MY GIRL. MY RIDE OR DIE. MY SOULMATE. UGH I LOVE HER SO MUCH. And I loved Casey too.  It was also wrapped up so well. The last chapter felt so wholesome. And I loved the paranormal aspects!I would recommend going into this book pretty blindly so that you enjoy the plot twists and finding out these character’s dark secrets. I HIGHLY recommend this book, even to people that don’t typically reach for mysteries or thrillers. HUGE TRIGGER WARNING⚠️ : alcoholism"

That book was such a huge disappointment that I was screaming at the main character for being so stupid. But I'm such a sucker for books by Sager that I had to read this one after reading the synopsis. Then the cover was released and I dropped dead. My corpse rose so I could read this one. And surprise surprise this was phenomenal. Welcome back to the horror club!! Sager goes back to his chilling horror roots. I wasn't expecting that at all and I'm glad he came back to the darkside. We do have the best cookies though. You will be amazed at how this ends and I didn’t see most of it coming. He shocked me and I love it! Not a lot gets passed me with these kinds of books because I look at every single detail. I completely missed the mark here and I'm overjoyed that I did. The ending made me think of a Sarah Pinborough ending. It was bizarre, downright weird, and made this weirdo fall in love. There is a lot of backstory here to follow and some people will find it excessive or not be able to follow along. It was the perfect lead way for what was to come. It all mattered and fit in. I'm confused as to why people are saying that none of it mattered because all of it did. It explained a lot of why things went the way that they did. It wasn't useless filler, it was helpful information. And why is there always a beefy handyman in these books!? I mean, I'm not complaining. Just stating the facts. The House Across the Street was a great book. I was sucked into this book the moment I started it. There was never a dull moment and the characters were all loons. Loved it! "

Casey, a minor actress, is hiding out at her summer cottage after a highly publicized scandal. Her husband died a year ago and she’s been drunk ever since. Casey spends her day spying on her neighbors across the lake. A very rich super model - Katherine - lives there, along with her broke husband Tom. Casey pulls the half drowned Katherine out of the lake. She’s sure something’s not right and the feeling intensifies when Katherine disappears.We’ve got all the usual ingredients. Unreliable narrator, an earlier disaster, a current situation that could be the misinterpretation of an inebriated mind. Then when you’re half asleep with boredom from all you’ve already read in some other book, we get a genre shift from thriller/who-whodunnit to the paranormal. I won’t say anymore, but it annoyed the hell out of me. I don’t like that kind of mindfuckery so far into a book. That I already hated it just made my brain melt, and not in a good way. This is the second book in a row by this author that has been way below reasonable expectations. I’m done. Not just with this book, but with the author."

Sadly, like the other books, I didn’t enjoy it and I’m wondering if this was maybe my last attempt to read a book by Sager.

Keep your eyes focused on the house across the lake.Plot/Pacing: ★★★★★Characters: ★★★Mystery(s)/Reveal(s): ★★★★★Enjoyment: ★★★★Casey Fletcher is at her family's lake house for the summer for a forced recuperation from the press. A character actress who has spent the past year burning down her life with alcohol and bad decisions, she's drinking her way through her own personal lockdown in rural Vermont. It's an interesting place for Casey to attempt to find her center, as it's the location of her husband's death by drowning. Grieving, drinking, and trying her best not to think about her past, Casey doesn't have much to do while sitting in the house by herself. So she watches the residents around the lake. In particular, there's a house across from hers with an entire side of glass windows facing the lake—and therefore facing her. At night, the lit-up box is like a real-life dollhouse complete with the movements of its two real-life inhabitants: tech mogul Tom Royce and his former model wife, Katherine. Casey witnesses some very odd things in the Royce house when no one is looking. And then Katherine disappears. With unsteady hands and yet a drive for the truth, Casey's decided she can't let this lie—what's happened to Katherine? And why is her husband, Tom, acting like nothing is wrong? Casey isn't prepared for the lid to blow off of Pandora's Box. But it's coming for her anyway. Be careful what you spy on... You might not like what you see. I think it's no secret that I am a huge fan of Riley Sager. Compulsively readable, engagingly paced, and ultimately fantastic fun, his stories are ones that I look forward to reading each year. His characters are the right level of flawed yet relatable. His plots veer from the mundane to the fantastical. And his settings drip with atmospheric tension. The House on the Lake delivered, again, another Sager hit. Without veering into spoiler territory, I really can't address the plot beyond what is mentioned above. I'd go into this story as blind as you can—it makes the ending more fun!I will say, the ending completely surprised me. I don't know if I read this on the right day or what, but that ending completely side-swiped me in left field as I confidently thought I had it all figured out. The surprise was a good one, for me, and I loved that the author caught me off my guard. The only thing that dragged this story down for me was the first half's pacing coupled with the heavy dose of Casey's alcoholism. Representation of her struggles was—to my limited knowledge—well done and accurate, but because the setting was so limited AND not much was happening beyond establishing the scene repeatedly, it made the alcohol references feel like they were repeating all over the place. I wish we'd had more going on in the early sections of the story to dilute that element of the plot. Overall, a fantastic read. Ready for the next one, Riley!Blog | Instagram | Libro.fm Audiobooks"

To say it bordered on the preposterous might be a little strong, since this is fiction after all, but toward the last third of the book the author really goes way out there. That twist is what turned me off to the rest of the book and I ended up severely disappointed despite having read and generally enjoyed all of this author’s previous stories.

Wow, I wish I could say more but to do so could ruin this reading experience for others. The book description says all you need to know and I highly suggest going in BLIND with this one without reading too many reviews!!!! I loved the main character, Casey Fletcher, with her snarky, brutally honest self! Her inner thoughts were funny and her self-awareness made her so likeable to me. Do yourself a favor and READ this book! Publication date is set for June 21st and it's going to be a hit!Thank you Edelweiss and Dutton books for my ARC in exchange for an honest review, I highly recommend!!"

182,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103886709-nicole-paddington-s-mom-x1f43e,Rating 2 out of 5,"Casey Fletcher is a widowed actress whose very public and drunken downfall lands her at her parents isolated lake house in Vermont. Binoculars, bourbon and neighbors with big glass windows leads to your typical thriller. Casey saves her neighbor, Katherine from drowning and they quickly strikes up a friendship. When Katherine disappears she becomes obsessed with seeking the truth of her whereabouts. This went from excellent, kept you guessing, page flipping exciting to… WTF????? And you won’t figure out the WTF until about page 200. You’ll never guess what’s going on because it’s so out of left field you might reread to make sure you saw it correctly the first time. I love Riley sager but this one had me shaking my head. 2 ⭐️ ⭐️ do not recommend. "
183,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75801211-max,Rating 1 out of 5,"I spoiled myself reading other reviews about how this book had the ""worst plot twist of all time"", but I'd have to agree. While I can't rant about it without going into spoiler territory, it is completely out of left field (not in a good way) with absolutely zero setup. It was even more frustrating than the dreams/hallucinations in Survive the Night . 90% of this book can be taken right out of Netflix's parody, and the other 10% will make absolutely zero sense. Worst Sager yet. "

It was definitely creepy but not what I signed up for.Instead of being atmospheric and psychological, it was repetitive and outrageous with a sprinkle of supernatural on top. Yep, that's right. If I'd known I wouldn't have even bothered.And FFS, I am so tired of the ""drunk girl can't be believed or trusted"" trope. That only worked on The Woman in the Window, which this is a slight ripoff of, except that book was better. It wasn't even necessary in this. We never really questioned if she saw what she said she did so booze was just thrown in constantly and haphazardly. As a former drunk, I get so sick of hearing about it. This was worse than the wine moms in melancholy suburbia books.This was a huge disappointment. I loved his last book but I haven't checked out the others yet. I still will but this was a dud."

It took on a more supernatural element and I did enjoy it but it was so crazy while reading it and it wasn’t something i was expecting at all. I liked it but I think there are other books by him that i think i will like more. I feel like there are a lot of people who have done this mystery narrative before where someone witnesses a murder or disappearance or something of that sort from watching across the street, lake, building…etc, so this was definitely a story that put a real twist on that. Did not expect the out come at all. I am happy i read it and i really didn’t hate it, but i didn’t love it. I want to read more by him and i wouldn’t tell anyone to not read it, but i wouldn’t prioritize it. "
191,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy,Rating 4 out of 5,"4 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https://bibliosanctum.com/2022/06/27/...The House Across the Lake is my third book by Riley Sager, and I liked it a lot! However, I’m not sure everyone will have a positive experience, mostly because there’s a HUGE twist at the end of this that I suspect will be quite contentious…The beginning, though, is a rather typical setup for a Rear Window kind of thriller. Casey Fletcher is our protagonist, recently widowed and trying to drink away her sorrows. An actress by trade, she has been fired from all her projects due to her increasingly worsening alcoholism, and after some prodding from her mother, Casey reluctantly agrees to take a break by spending some time away at the Vermont lake house that her family owns—the same place her husband drowned a year and a half before.Being here means that Casey can stay out of trouble for the most part, but she’s still trying to drink away the bad memories and spends her time looking through her binoculars at her glamorous neighbors, Tom and Katherine Royce, who live in the glass house across the lake. One day, Casey sees Katherine struggling in the water, and manages to avert another tragedy by swiftly coming to the rescue. The two of them strike up a quick friendship, making Casey feel a little guilty for spying on the Royces, but the more she spends time with the couple, the more she notices something off about the way Tom and Katherine behave around each other. Continuing to watch them though her binoculars, Casey realizes something is seriously wrong with Katherine’s marriage, and when her friend suddenly disappears, our protagonist becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to her.I’m just going to cut to the chase here. Whatever you might think is going to happen from the short synopsis I provided above, I guarantee it will be wrong. That’s because for most of the novel, Sager leads you to believe The House Across the Lake is going to be another one of your ordinary run-of-the-mill thriller mysteries with a perfectly mundane albeit exciting explanation that you would expect, if not perfectly predict. In reality though, it’s all just a ruse to make you feel all the more astonished and knocked for a loop when everything—and I mean everything—is turned on its head once he drops the big twist.And it’s big. Genre-changing big. Without spoiling even the tiniest of details, I’ll just say that there is a supernatural element to this, and that is why I think reactions to the ending will be mixed depending on the type of reader you are. Even speaking as someone who enjoys fantasy and speculative fiction, I felt the twist was a bit too much, too sudden, and too in-your-face, so if you’re more into earthly non-supernatural thrillers, I can see how the bombshell might frustrate or even anger you.For my part though, I enjoyed it. Up until that point, I was admittedly getting drawn into the lull, and while I wouldn’t say I was bored, I have to say I was expecting a little more from the author. The twist changed all that. As awkward as the actual transition was, my interest in the story and how it would end immediately shot straight up to the stratosphere. For a bit of context, I happen to love any kind of sci-fi or fantasy, even if it’s just a dash of it in my fiction. When it’s in my thrillers, mysteries, or horror, I love it even more. Think Sarah Pinborough’s Behind Her Eyes. That kind of stuff really does it for me.So, consider this a warning or an endorsement, depending on the kind of reader you are. If you typically enjoy Riley Sager though, The House Across the Lake is definitely worth checking out for his suspenseful prose and characters. The audiobook was also fantastically narrated by Bernadette Dunne, who is amazing. Though I had imagined a less mature and sophisticated voice for Casey, I really can’t complain when it’s one of my favorite narrators doing the reading. Highly recommend if you are into audiobooks to consider the audio edition."

This one was just an ok for me, It did pickup after 65% of the way through the book and things got a little more interesting, but I just didn't care for the main character - Casey.Casey has followed in your mother's show biz footsteps, she is an actress and was doing really well for herself. Her husband recently drowned out at Casey's family lake house from an accidental drowning. One year on, Casey is still struggling with Lens death, her drinking is out of control, she was fired from her play on broadway because she turned up to a matinée session drunk out of her mind.The tabloids have wasted no time, filling the headlines yet again with Casey's spiralling drunken behaviour. Her mother is embarrassed, the unwanted attention its bought on her she ships Casey off to the family Lakehouse to get herself together away from the very public eye in NYC.Casey continues her drinking at the Lakehouse, it's the same lake that her husband died on. She befriends a couple across the lake who are staying there for a few weeks. She ends up rescuing the wife from drowning in the lake and they become fast friends.... Casey uncovers there is trouble in the relationship.... meh.Things start to take off 70% in there are a few twists to the story which I wont spoil, the last one was a bit obvious, it just fell a little short for me. But I will still read any book Riley releases.Final Girls is still my favourite from him.... I give this one 3 stars"

Also: she’s drunk. From drinks. Lots of them. Mostly bourbon. But sometimes wine. Because drunk ladies like to drink all the drinks and get paranoid and abuse their access to high-powered binoculars.”This trope is tired, so tired, like three-or was it four? I’m too drunk to count-day-drinks-of-bourbon tired. Please. Fucking. Stop. It. Already. With. The. Drunk. White. Ladies. But… I still weirdly sort of liked it in parts because some super bananas shit happens that makes it a bit different than all of the other drunk white lady books, but that bananas shit was so bananas that I lost it again, and I hated this book, but still kind of enjoyed (hate) reading it because I wanted to see what nonsense would happen next, thus I am left conflicted but mostly irritated, and decidedly, unfortunately, not drunk.

194,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14321329-christina-pilkington,Rating 2 out of 5,"What a huge disappointment! I can't decide which I disliked more- Survive the Night or The House Across the Lake. As much as I hate to say it, I think I have to go with this one being worse. At least in Survive the Night I wasn't bored. The story started out fine. Casey Fletcher, an actress and recent widow, retreats to her family's lake house to grieve and also escape the press who have been chronicling her alcoholism. A new family moves in across the lake, and Casey makes friends with the couple, all the while spying on them with her binoculars. The set up could have been interesting, but the characters were so lackluster. They felt very surface-level. The story also felt too much like A Woman in the Window and many other stories I have read before. The plot does become more original in the second half, but there was a twist that really made me mad because it relies on withholding information from the reader that just doesn't make any sense from from a first person POV. I don't mind out-there twists, but they need to have a sense of believability. The plot just kept getting more and more wacky. It reminded me a lot of the ending of Survive the Night- not in the way it ended, but in how it kept getting more and more ridiculous. Not sure if I will pick up Sager's next book. I know that it won't be right away, though. "
195,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/144985499-lancali-lancali,Rating 3 out of 5,"*spoiler free review*Riley Sager is undoubtedly a talented writer and he proves this with his past novels. This book might’ve just not been for me? It felt very similar in writing style to some other murder mysteries I’ve read but it’s clear that this would’ve been a far more predictable read if there weren’t just a few details hidden up until the end of the novel. There was suspense and direct, well-thought-out dialogue, but the story itself dragged and wasn’t compelling or satisfying by the end. It’s a decent summer read, but I didn’t feel attached to any character enough to feel something by the ending. Would recommend to fans of The Girl on the Train or the Silent Patient. "

Aż boli mnie serce, bo poprzednie książki (szczególnie ,,Zamknij wszystkie drzwi"") zrobiły na mnie fenomenalne wrażenie, a tutaj pod koniec opadły mi ręce.

This story is about a famous actress who is staying at her families cabin after a scandal breaks out over her excessive drinking. While staying at this cabin she starts slowly spying on her neighbors across the lake. One day she hears a scream and notices that the wife has gone missing.

206,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31535900-jonathon-von,Rating 3 out of 5,"2.5 It's weird to read a book that seems to hold the basic philosophy, you can never underestimate the audience's intelligence enough. To say that this book is stupid is like saying a flamethrower is dangerous. It's weaponized stupidity. If you can think of a twist no sane person would think of and somehow misdirect the audience away from something which no one would guess, it must be the right idea. I don't necessarily want to spoil it because God help me, it held my attention and I had to keep going. After the mind-boggling Survive The Night, I had a masochistic hunger for another so-bad-it's-good thriller. And for a good while, that's what I got. A drunk TV actress in a lake home has been watching her wealthy neighbors have arguments and act generally weird. We know she drinks a lot because it is mentioned possibly on every single page. She's a lonely, blackout drunk horny weirdo with a nice pair of binoculars and a pair of ridiculously hot neighbors engaging in suspicious activities. What did you expect? Also, her husband died suspiciously the year before, the hunky guy who she's constantly drooling over's wife died mysteriously, and some teen girls have gone missing. People keep dying around the lake but it's still the most beautiful thing on earth. But none of that matters because she DRINKS and she thinks her supermodel neighbor is her best friend all of the sudden and something is definitely wrong. And did I mention she's seen Rear Window a bunch of times? This book overexplains every moment like it's trying to tell the story to a precocious ten-year-old and failing. It's a book written at a sixth-grade level for horny drunks who've got a passing familiarity with Alfred Hitchcock. I thought the book had gone bonkers when it turned out what she thought was happening was also the plot of the play she had just spent six months doing (like, maybe that should have sounded familiar?). But, oh no, I had totally underestimated Sager's commitment to the preposterous.Before the third act twist, which I will not reveal but is ""totally normal and cool"", I was 100% confident I had figured out the ending about fifty pages in, and the book was being obscenely coy by throwing out obvious details like minor revelations. And I wasn't far off in a way, but the way the book spins its wheels as if the most incredibly apparent thing is a mystery makes the main character look like an absolute maniac. There is also a weird pattern of situations requiring the assumption that someone knows a drunk lady is watching them through binoculars at an exact moment. What if she had to pee or something? Also, the hunky suspicious dude asks her if ""arent you lonely out here by yourself?"" about two minutes into meeting her which is an incredible creep move.There are so many dumb things it definitely has a b-movie weirdness like the hallmark channel made a horror movie brought to you by cough syrup. And, honestly, I got some of the so-bad-it's-good I showed up for. But when the big twist drops and the book goes, ""Surprise! I'm actually batshit insane!"", I started to feel like maybe I was the mark and not the smug ironic consumer."

208,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93439609-el,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is atrociously bad. It’s bad in so many different ways that it’s like it hit the Bad Writing Bingo, and I’m genuinely impressed that something so aggressively mediocre and offensively dumb got so much buzz. Whatever preservation instinct in the back of my mind had me avoiding Riley Sager despite goodreads shoving all his books at me on every occasion was right, and I was a fool for ignoring it. Bad Writing Bingo checklist, mild spoilers ahead.✓ Horrible pacing. This book takes 300 pages to get anywhere and then it just doesn’t end, an avalanche of over-the-top reveals one after another. There are endless stretches of dull nothingsoup (an unforgivable sin for a thriller) while the main character allegedly grieves and descents descending into alcoholism, even though the writing fails at conveying any kind of emotion so it’s like reading a summary of a summary. Then a bunch of things happen at once and keep happening, and happening, and happening, and it should be fun but the lack of emotional connection with any of the characters + the complete absence of any feeling of high stakes in the plot makes it feel more like getting whacked in the head by a bat that won’t stop. ✓ Relatedly: foreshadowing fail. Some of the characters’ actions make no sense in light of future plot developments, but I guess setting them up properly would have minimized the shock value. Yawn.✓ Flat characterisation. We are told the main character is sad and grieving and possibly traumatize; the writing shows none of that. There are a lot of interchangeable characters with stock plot roles and minimal personalities, and a potential love interest introduced early on which I completely forgot about by the time he shows up again because everyone is a non-entity. I didn’t care about anyone, couldn’t even muster up the energy to hate them. They are all uniformly bland and terrible and a waste of my time.✓ Relatedly: bonus Male-Author-Writing-Women moments, such as this sparkling moment where the (female) main character thinks:“Ah, the old minimize-a-woman’s-concern-by-making-her-think-she’s-obsessed-and-slightly-hysterical bit. I expected something more original from Tom.”So thought no woman ever. This reads like a man trying to describe what he thinks a woman’s annoyance at being talked down to by a man ought to feel like, but it’s so clumsy it just made me eyeroll instead.✓ Supernatural elements that are meant to feel creepy but are just laughable. Everyone is awful quick in believing in the supernatural despite the near-complete lack of set-up or foreshadowing, and the way it unfolds could have been tasty but it just feels like a campfire horror story at a teenage summer camp. ✓ Fragmented prose that destroys any kind of suspense. It’s all super short paragraphs that are half a sentence long and are probably supposed to convey tension but were so overused that it felt like reading someone’s shopping list and ended up having the opposite result. The writing felt very stilted and I found it very hard to connect to the plot because it all read like a checklist. The book opens with the main character lying to the police about the man tied up in her basement, and I completely forgot about that for the first third of the book because the writing was so dull it was like being anaesthetized. tl,dr: this was not only bad but offensively so. Props to Sager’s marketing team for hustling to promote this nonsense!"

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐇𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐀𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐋𝐚𝐤𝐞 was that perfect mix of whodunnit/what the heck is going on mystery and spookiness that had me furiously turning pages. I love a mystery with a bit of ghostly spook in it so this book was easy for me to suspend my disbelief and simply sink to. ⁣⁣So without giving too much away - what do we have here? Disgraced former actress Casey Fletcher, our unreliable bourbon drinking MC, has been relegated to her family’s lake house after a rough year. There she spends her days and nights, in a drunken stupor, spying on her neighbors through binoculars. Her spying pays off when she spots Katherine Royce drowning and saves her life, making them instant BFFs. Shortly thereafter, Katherine goes missing and no one seems to take her disappearance seriously. Except Casey of course. ⁣⁣Told in alternating Before & Now timelines we team up with Casey and the sexy, former cop from next door to find Katherine as secrets unfold from the past year in Casey’s life. Obviously, all is not what it seems and there is danger afoot! ⁣⁣I was all in for the twists and extraordinary elements! And the ending - so satisfying! I loved it! If you enjoy your mystery/thrillers with twists, a splash of the paranormal and characters that fill you with nothing but doubt and mistrust - don’t miss this one. Pure page turning entertainment!⁣"
211,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6158946-gyuri,No Rating,"Update 1/28/22:At this point, this book truly is a joke. I started watching the Netflix show mentioned below and the main character reads a book titled 'The Woman ACROSS THE LAKE', that is basically Sager's novel: ""When high-powered attorney Grace St. James escapes to her dream house by the lake, her dream becomes a nightmare after she witnesses a gruesome murder"". I wonder, will Sager accuse them of stealing?Update 12/12/21:This plot is so overused by now that even Netflix decided to make a parody movie about it (The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window), so the publication of this novel is doubly hilarious.10/22/21:This story has been written ten millions times already (e.g. The Woman in the Window, The Girl on the Train). Of course, this is not shocking, because we are talking about Sager after all, who steals and rehashes plots of well-known books all the time (e.g. Lock Every Door - Rosemary's Baby; Home Before Dark - every haunted house novel you have ever read). Being inspired is one thing, but reusing plots of other novels is simply sad. And the fact that he has the audacity to then bash the superb Grady Hendrix and accuse him of stealing? I don't care Sager has apologized: he's nothing but an incredibly amateurish and insecure ""writer"" with middling talent and absolutely no ideas of his own."

All I have to say is I got so many chills and my eyes even got watery from how spooky this book was. There was never a moment of boredom. It constantly had me on my toes, wanting answers to everything. The amount of plot twists in this book was insane. There was even a plot twist that happened at the end of the book, which completely caught me off guard. The way that everything played out was so satisfying. I loved how we got answers to everything, and it all made sense. Little details from early on in the book got explained, and it was nice to see how everything lined up. There was this constant feeling of suspense and uneasiness, which I loved because it’s exactly the feeling a thriller should give you. Overall, this book was very interesting, entertaining, and fun with a bunch of suspicious characters. The ending gave me chills and had me saying “wow” over and over again.

I know her thoughts left out things to keep the reader knowing one of the twists but i got to it and felt like it was so significant that she would have been thinking of it often and it should have altered other thoughts she had. I did love Katherine’s call back quote though! The very very end of how the neighbors plot wrapped up made me so angry, I can’t really say why without spoiling it but really just wasn’t for me😞"

I knew to expect a story that would go totally off the rails towards the ending. That meant I was pretty entertained throughout its entirety as I read about Casey drowning herself in alcohol and being a nosy neighbor.The writing here was very easy to get into and the fast pace made it for a quick read! I was intrigued by the overall mystery and conflict surrounding the house across the lake and its people, but I will say that I figured out parts of what was happening so so so damn fast. The only reason the supernatural twist here was a surprise was because Sager introduced it pretty much out of nowhere as a way to tie several plot points together. Hence why this book is a mess. The tone shift was so incredibly abrupt that I actually laughed out loud when that reveal took place.With that said, I had so much fun with this. It was so dramatic and unhinged and some of the resolutions were so damn convenient that I kept focused right until the end. I did wish the ending had been less of a happy one for Casey, though, but I wasn't mad about it."

While it's true that I have a unique perspective as a Sager fan, I am also considering the book's target audience in my review of The House Across the Lake.Synopsis:Casey Fletcher is grieving the recent loss of her husband. Casey has the propensity to bury her sadness in a bottle of bourbon. To regain her life she retreats to the family lake house. Casey meets the seemingly flawless couple across the lake, but as she gets to know her newly found friends better, she has doubts. Something feels suspicious about the circumstance. Is anyone who they seem?The House Across the Lake captured my imagination. It is difficult to describe the plot without giving away any spoilers. If you are looking for a mind-bending psychological thriller Sager has it, but it is so much more. For Sager's work to be enjoyed, one must suspend all sense of reality and just let the story flow. The result will be a captivating journey. The House Across the Lake is gritty and intense. I was visually drawn into the book through the descriptive writing. I read many books that follow a basic thriller outline, but this novel presented a different context that I found fascinating. Sager moved the boundaries of realism with shocking plot twists. I fully understand that this book may not be suitable or desirable for everyone. Check the trigger warning before reading it. (5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)The House Across the Lake by the gifted Riley Sager is available by Hodder and Stoughton on July 7th.Thank you, NetGalley, and Hodder and Stoughton, for the wonderful opportunity to review The House Across the Lake.

DID YOU SAY REAR WINDOW INSPIRED?
Buckle up, buttercup! This is one wild ride! It just isn't summer without a new spine-tingler from Riley Sager, but never fear; The House Across the Lake brings the thrills and chills in spades!In the fourteen months since her husband's death, actress Casey Fletcher has fallen apart in spectacular fashion. After her drunken escapades end up on the front pages of every tabloid, Casey is banished to her family's secluded lake house in Vermont. Boredom and drunkenness do not generally mix, leading Casey to develop a less-than-healthy habit of watching her neighbors through high-powered binoculars. Her favorite subjects? Tom and Katherine Royce, a tech guru and his former supermodel wife. After Katherine nearly drowns in the lake, and Casey saves her life, the two women develop an unlikely friendship. As they get to know one another better, cracks appear in the Royce's storybook romance. Casey begins to suspect that the shiny facade of the glass castle Katherine and Tom share is hiding something dark. Something dangerous. As the late night spying sessions go on, her misgivings grow even stronger. Then Katherine disappears. Casey just knows Tom has done something to her friend, but she can't tell anyone HOW she knows. What Casey doesn't realize is that there is always more than one side to the story, and secrets never stay submerged for long.I loved this book so hard! I had immense empathy for Casey, having my own experience with self destruction, and I just wanted to hug her. Her loneliness was stark and striking. All of the characters were suspect: I didn't trust any of them, but I definitely wanted to know more about them. I was so tense reading this, my fingernails are bitten to stubs! And there are twists and turns so sharp, I'm amazed I don't have whiplash. Sager has a wicked way with words, and The House Across the Lake is dripping with menace and suspense. Just make sure you lock every door, (see what I did there?) close all the curtains, and turn off all the lights before you turn the first page. You never know who might be watching.Thank you to Netgalley and Dutton Books for the chance to review this advance copy. The House Across the Lake is available 6/21/2022."
225,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/130304973-katherine-earhart,Rating 5 out of 5,"Here we go. Where to begin... Forgive me in advance... I'm not a perfect reviewer and have a little bit to say.Riley Sager is an auto-buy for me. I won't lie, when I started to notice the lower rated reviews on ""The House Across the Lake"", I started to get nervous.. Even though last years book, ""Survive the Night"", was not a big hit, I still enjoyed that one as well.I personally think that Riley's past two books, Survive the Night and House Across the Lake are similar. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time during both books, which I absolutely LOVED. I also think all the twists played out perfectly. I did feel like I was able to guess the approaching twists correctly a little more during Survive the Night. But I could not guess at all during The House Across the Lake so that is what made it so exciting for me. I know I'm in the minority here but I absolutely loved it. I actually was purposely prolonging reading it so I could enjoy every moment of it. I am hungover from sadness that it is over.When I think about ""Lock Every Door"" and ""Home Before Dark"", I think those two books are similar. I absolutely LOVED them both and there was always something constantly going on where as Survive the night and House across the Lake were a little bit slower, but the twists were big which made it worth reading from beginning to end.I'm not giving up on Riley. I think he did very well with House Across the Lake. I feel like from here on out, he is going to be a surprise for me and I think that is what I love about him. Am I going to get fast paced suspense action or am I going to get the slower, edge of my seat suspense but the twists hit me right in the gut? I know a lot of reviews mention, this is like ""the woman in the window"", once again a ""drunk main character"". Sure, I can see where people felt that way but honestly the drinking did not distract me at all from wanting to figure this book out. I fully respect and admire all of the reviews I have read on this book. It makes it for fun for me to see how everyone is feeling about it.Until next time."

I devoured this book in one sitting and could not read it fast enough.The House Across the Lake takes place on a beautiful lake in Vermont. Casey, is a famous actress but has had some horrible things happen to her so she has turned to the bottle. Her mother gave her an ultimatum, go to the lakehouse and detox or go to rehab. Casey decides to go to the lakehouse where her drinking gets worse. The lakehouse is where her husband drowned a year ago. While in her drinking stupor and being bored she spies on the house across the lake, the golden couple. Although, the more she spies the more she realizes this couple is anything from perfect. The wife goes missing and Casey knows she needs to get her act together and help find her.Y'all when I say this book had me shocked I mean it. I was so shocked I had to stop reading and think about what I read before continuing. I don't want to give away anything, but if you're wanting a wild plot twist then you need to read this. I really loved how this book was set up. I like how the plot slowly unfolds, but at the same time keeps you on the edge of your seat. Casey was a handful of a main character, but I felt what she was going through and thought she was a really developed character. The way Sager shows grief and alcoholism was very spot on and I appreciate how realistic he wrote it.I could imagine myself on this lake, but after reading this book you won't find me near any lake. While this didn't top my favorite Sager book, it came a close second. I loved where Sager took this storyline and thought it was very original."

I wanted to be proven wrong, but sadly, it seems that just isn't the author for me.The first 67% of the book was engaging, and I liked it well enough to think it would end up being a four-star read. I overlooked some little things, such as the tired trope of the drunk/mentally unstable woman no one believes. I even overlooked the underlying hostility that is present in the creation of just about every female character by this author; he seems to be communicating that women are ""less than""; helpless and inferior. Again, I was having a good time with the book, so I put those issues in the back of my mind because I was enjoying unraveling this mystery. When the first twist came, my guess was wrong; when I figured it out, I thought, ""Oh man, maybe this will end up being a five star read!""And then I got to 67% mark where I did a literal double-take to make sure I read what I thought I read. I tossed my Kindle aside in disgust and went to bed. When I picked it up the next morning, things were headed straight to ""woo-woo-ville"" with no logical explanation save for a brief story about a legend associated with the lake. By the time the final twist appeared almost at the book's end, it was beyond salvageable.I like being surprised by thrillers. I adore clever red herrings. I do not, however, like being duped by cheap plot devices."

If there is a Most Boring Book category for 2022, this is the winner.Those binoculars must be magical, they can read facial expressions and eye movements across a lake at night. What’s more amazing is that she has consumed enough booze to sink a battleship, I can’t imagine she could even hold and focus binoculars in her drunken state. C’mon!! How many times do I have to read she heard a scream across the lake?She returns to New York via car service at 8:00 in the morning - a five hour trip. When exactly had she ordered the car service - before or after the infamous scream?

It was either beyond genius or absolutely ridiculous... I JUST DON'T KNOW!This is a slow burn but totally bingeable. I finished this book in just two sittings. Regardless of being kind of over the whole ""drunk widow who spies on her neighbors"" trope, I was invested. I HAD to know what happened in The House Across The Lake.

I was really looking forward to this book as it had great reviews/ratings; but I’m sorry to say that this book was a disappointment. I truly enjoyed the first 60% of the book but when we got to the one plot twist, this book totally lost me. Since I don’t want to give any spoilers, if you read the book you know the part I am talking about. The twist was completely unbelievable and came from left field. To be honestly, if I wasn’t fulling invested in the book from the first half, I would have DNF right there and then. The narrator of the audiobook was fantastic but overall, if this is going to be the theme of Sager’s future books, I won’t likely be reading them.I rated this as 3.5 stars but rounding down on Goodreads."

I was completely shocked by the twist in this one and could not put it down until I got to the final page. Add in the element of an unreliable narrator who drinks excessively and I was hooked to find if she was really telling the whole truth.This one gave such atmospheric lake house vibes that I could basically picture myself on my family's lake house lawn watching everything unfold. It was quick, twisty and entertaining and I'm reminded again why I love his books so much. Definitely recommend picking this one up and going in as blind as possible for a fun and thrilling read this summer, publishes Tuesday, June 21st!"

244,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/752176-vanessa,Rating 3 out of 5,"Another summer and another Riley Sager thriller. It's a soothing tradition, even though nothing quite matches the glorious chaotic insanity of his first book, Final Girls. This one is good although it has a slowish beginning. Not Sager's best but also not his worst. It was fun and entertaining and occasionally preposterous and that is all I'm looking for here. Despite the familiar settings--a newly reopened summer camp with a tragic backstory, horror in a creepy Rosemary's Babyish high-rise (which gets a blink and you'll miss it shoutout here), this boozy, vaguely Rear Windowish tale--I still continue to find his books suspenseful and surprising (Except last year's book, Survive the Night, you can probably skip that one and instead read The Final Girl Support Group by Grady Hendrix, because it's super excellent.)The rest of Sager’s not-so-secret recipe: a young woman with a traumatic past, a handsome friendly dude who may or may not be up to no good, a twisty plot, and murder. Fade in: Casey Fletcher is moderately successful actress who is in hiding at her family's Vermont lake house after a personal tragedy (see? Check!) and very public meltdown has sent her into a downward spiral of sadness and bourbon.And I like drinking. A lot. I like the way I feel after three or four or five drinks. Limp and floating. A jellyfish drifting in a calm sea. Even though I know it won't last--that at some point in the future I might be dry-mouthed and headachy and heaving it all back up--that temporary weightlessness was worth it. But when Casey saves her supermodel neighbor from drowning, it starts a whole thing. Casey catches a vibe something is amiss and thinks the husband is up to no good, especially when the neighbor goes missing shortly after. Good thing Casey's been keeping a friendly eye on them with her binoculars and is on the case. Everyone will totally believe her when she explains that she thinks someone has been murdered because she's been spying on her famous neighbors for days now while consuming snootfuls on her back deck.And obviously no spoilers, but Sager does do something new in this one (I don’t know that i necessarily loved the new thing, but we’ll see if it becomes a new ingredient, I guess.)Sager is pretty much an old faithful and at this point it's just a given I'll select him as my Book of the Month pick next summer too."

Sager has one of the most imaginative brains out there and knows how to set the stage perfectly without giving away any twists. I was absolutely sure I knew what was going to happen and ended up being 100 percent wrong. I also enjoy books with a supernatural element, which this story had. A great creepy read before Halloween. Absolutely recommend."

I started the book immediately after getting an ARC and binged it in a day. I so wanted to love this and continue Sager's winning streak, but alas! What a letdown. I know a lot of people said that the trope of an alcoholic recluse who spies on her neighours is overused but I didn't mind at all! I was interested to see how the author would put a fresh spin on things. Even though Casey was quite a cliche character and at times I felt like she really needed to get a life, I thought her POV as an alcoholic was realistic and so on point. Goodness knows how I used to drink so that I could forget as well.I was afraid that this would turn out to be a typical domestic thriller. Then came a brilliant twist slightly more than halfway through that I didn't see coming at all and loved! Ah, there's the Riley Sager that I know.Unfortunately, as the saying goes: Be careful what you wish for. Turns out there's nothing typical about this book, because suddenly there's a twist so outlandish and stupid and awful that it ruined the entire book for me. I also felt like the author tried to squeeze too much into the ending so as to be even more twisty but it didn't have the desired effect for me.Now I'm wishing this was a typical domestic thriller and I would have still enjoyed it much more. Seriously, I'm so bummed by this wack of a book. Not that it will stop me from continuing to read Riley Sager 😂Thank you to Dutton Books and Netgalley for an ARC."

It's certainly going to be an adventure. Sage is a master of twists, so I can never be too certain what to expect with his books, but I know one thing for sure: This one will be the talk of the summer. The summary of this book draws from a familiar trope, self-referencing Rear Window: a woman stuck at her family lake house spends her time spying on the neighbors, only to suspect the golden couple across the lake maybe isn't so perfect after all, especially when the wife, Katherine, suddenly goes missing. That is where the familiar tropes end though. If I can say one thing about this book, it's go in with an open mind and get ready for the unexpected! I binge read this on a rainy day, falling in love with the setting (autumn on a Vermont lake), the hodgepodge of characters who lived there, and the wild twist on a common thriller trope. I'm not going to spoil anything or even give you any hints, but I'll say that even my knack for guessing endings didn't prepare me for what this book had in store. The House Across the Lake left me unsure how to feel about anyone and also completely freaked out about the idea of going into water this summer. I also want to note that while the spying-on-neighbors isn't my favorite thriller trope (nor is a character made unreliable by substance abuse), I have to hand it to Sager for keeping me engaged the whole time and taking the time to address the issue of addiction in the storyline. Also if my neighbors had a fancy glass house, I'd be looking too!"

The House Across the Lake, the book that is on everyone's radar. The book that people literally salivate while thinking about (trust me, I was one of those) . I, was one of the lucky few who was granted an approval from the thriller gods at Netgalley. I typically read my ARC's in the order in which they are published, but come on, its Riley Sager, I had to bump this one up to top priority. So much so that I put down the book I was currently reading to get this one started and I do not regret one thing! The House Across the Lake, is going to be the easiest ""pre-order"" decision you ever make. As per always, this is nothing short of a five star read. I mean, come on, Its Riley Sager, he is the King of the thriller world (move over Stephen King) . I loved every bit of this book from start to finish, so much so that I was getting up at 5am to squeeze in a few more chapters before work, skipped lunch to read, and then served my husband frozen dinners to maximize my reading time. (well worth it! sorry babe!) Anyway, this book is filled with characters you love, and love to hate. I emotionally attached myself to Casey and began to root for her. This was a wild ride that had so many unexpected twists. The ending is one that left my jaw on the ground. This is a book hangover that will last a lot longer than an alcohol induced one. Do yourself a favor, buy the book. You wont regret it. Five stars, duh ."
249,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38484147-samantha-bookstasamm,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars rounded up I really struggled with my rating for this book. Riley Sager is hit or miss for me, and The House Across the Lake was somewhere in the middle. I ended up with 3.5/5 stars for this one. The beginning of the book is a slow burn. There wasn’t much action going on besides Casey saving Katherine from drowning. This incident causes Casey to grab some binoculars and spy on Katherine and her husband, Tom’s house across the lake. The biggest problem with the beginning for me was that I’m over the alcoholic woman spying on neighbors thinks she sees something bad happen, but because she was drinking doesn’t know if it’s real trope! It’s just overdone. Once the book picks up pace, there were so many great curves thrown in, and honestly I didn’t see any of them coming! With only a handful of characters that could be suspects I think I blamed everyone at least once and hoped it wasn’t certain characters more than others. Sager did a great job with shocking me throughout the last third of the book! I listened along to the audiobook while reading this one, and I do think that affected my rating. The choice of narrator for this book was wrong. Her voice sounded too old for Casey and the audiobook just didn’t work for me. I really think my rating would be higher if I had just read the eARC alone. Thank you NetGalley, Penguin Group Dutton, and PRH Audio got advanced copies in exchange for my honest review."

It kept me mostly engaged because I DEFINITELY didn’t see any of the stuff coming (I try not to guess during thrillers unless it’s insanely obvious) - not what I expected but also that’s not a good thing maybe? LOLSo Casey has a lake house and spies on her neighbors across the lake, this alone is just insane. This exposition the first 50% of the book could have been cut SO MUCH - there was too much description of how Casey gaslights herself about what she sees while spying due to alcoholism. I get why she thinks that, but she doesn’t need to tell ME that a million times. Overall the book was so…. Absurd. A wild ride that made me feel like I’m the one with the hangover, not CaseyI don’t want to say much, so without going into too much detail BUT STOP READING KF YOU WANT TO GO INTO THIS COMPLETELY BLIND. STOP RIGHT NOW. Ok you guys what the hell was up with the supernatural element of this book 😭 literally so out of left field. And the character of Boone felt like a last minute addition who was given almost no thought. It just didn’t make any sense!??!? But it’s still a 3 star rather than a 2 because it kept me intrigued and I wanted to see what the heck was actually happening these people!! But it was just a bonkers story"

252,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6915263-nev,Rating 1 out of 5,"No. Rear Window is one of my favorite movies of all time. So I’m primed to enjoy a story about a nosy person spying on their neighbors and thinking that they’ve seen a crime be committed. But this was just trash. For the first half it was just feeling like a very underwhelming version of that story, but it was okay enough. Then where the story goes was just so bonkers and not enjoyable. I’m annoyed because it’s not alluded to at all in the synopsis of the book. The ending is ridiculous and over the top and had me rolling my eyes so aggressively I thought they were going to pop out of their sockets. "
253,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6857324-lauren-stoolfire,Rating 2 out of 5,"The House Across the Lake is easily my least favorite book from Riley Sager so far which is disappointing because I've really enjoyed most of his other releases. I'd say this was fine except a little too familiar - very much The Woman in the Window, The Girl on the Train, with some Rear Window (at least it acknowledges the Rear Window similarity) - up until the last 100 pages or so. That's when it really started to lose me. Then we got the reveal and that paranormal element which really came out of left field. Usually I appreciate paranormal stories but here in this case it just didn't work for me. Overall, this is just disappointing for starting off as well as it did."

Maybe it's because I had super low expectations from reading all the bad reviews, but I thought this was a fun, fast-paced read! The twists are what made it super fun. The twists were a part of the typical Riley Sager formula where you get a twist of a twist. I know people don't like that, but it's his thing and I don't mind it. Also, I think a lot of people didn't like the way things went towards the end of the book, but I thought it was what made the book fun! I really recommend keeping an open mind while reading it. It's also the perfect read if you're in a reading slump and looking for a fun book!"

265,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29279709-karen,Rating 5 out of 5,"THE HOUSE ACROSS THE LAKEBY: RILEY SAGERI have owned many of this talented author's Riley Sager's thriller novels and this one so far is my favorite called, The House Across the Lake. A young woman is living a solitary life that she prefers in her family's cabin. She is prone to drinking alcohol and watching the couple that live across the lake from her with her binoculars when she thinks that she witnesses an assault. It turns out that this beautiful woman and her husband cross the lake with their boat and motor up to her dock with an expensive bottle of alcohol which the husband brags about the price. The two women make an instant connection but this nice woman is a little unsteady on her feet. The woman who did the spying is concerned since she likes her new friend, but the reason for her new friend stumbling is attributed to the alcohol consumed. Then she disappears and it is thought by the consensus of the few neighbors that the husband did away with his wife. The tension ratchets up the more that you read and this is one adrenaline rush of a thrill ride with a compelling ending that is impossible to guess. It's a memorable mystery-thriller that touches on the paranormal. I usually don't read novels involving the paranormal so it was a combination of excellent storytelling with superb character development that I endorse this one with a must read recommendation. I loved it and it has made me a fan. Wow this was excellent and a great discovery."
266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95002573-kelly,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a beach read for me, so I read it on and off over the course of a few days. It was very easy to jump back into it each time and it was hard to put it down. I almost wish I would have read this when I could have given it more attention so I could have a stronger opinion about it. Personally, I enjoyed this book and was entertained and satisfied with how it played out. I can understand some reviewers' complaints and dislikes, but Riley Sager's writing always holds my attention and keeps me turning the pages. I have the Barnes & Noble special edition and I think the added chapter should have been included in all the versions and maybe even worked in throughout the book, rather than put at the end. I think it really helped add to an element of the story that I think a lot of readers struggled with enjoying.Spoilers ahead:  More specifically, I think the supernatural elements should have been more prominent from the start. It isn't really just a ""thriller"" and I think that probably throws the story off for some readers. The extra chapter could have been worked into the story in a way to show what was happening to Katherine and create a greater sense of creepiness.  Sager is one of my favorite authors and I always look forward to his books."
267,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2195363-leslie,Rating 3 out of 5,"My toxic trait is announcing (often publicly) that I will not read any future books by an author and then being a hypocrite and reading (often all) future books by said author. Sometimes I do stick to my resolution. But so many times I get sucked in by the blurb of the new one. Before I know it, I’m halfway through the book and (often) yelling at myself. I’m going to have to accept that although I haven’t truly liked any of this author’s books except one, I’m just going to keep reading them. I don’t hate them. They are extremely readable and I get sucked in immediately. Then I end them feeling somewhat unsatisfied. 🤷🏻‍♀️This one had the ever tiring trope of the nosy, single, alcoholic woman with too much time on her hands. I imagine this could be me without the alcohol. As I’m prone to peeking out my window to see what the neighbors are doing. They are never as interesting as ones in books. Which is good because…murder and stuff. I don’t suppose I could pitch a book about a nosy, single woman filled with increasing rage about her neighbor always parking right in front of her house instead of their own area. 😂"

Secrets were revealed, including Len's dark connection with the missing girls.I went to this book blindly, so I was surprised when it became supernatural with the lake. I thought this would be like Sager's Lock Every Door. And it is really disturbing and uncomfortable—Casey is watching her neighbor Katherine and her husband at their house, even if it led her to save Kat."

The setting, unreliable characters, the tension build-up, short chapters and supernatural angles make it unputdownable for me. He knows how to keep his readers guessing.I have to admit that I resented this book in the beginning as the story seemed too familiar, but the author put an unpredictable twist to it that I kept turning pages. I am glad that I didn't read the synopsis first. A woman dealing with alcoholism and snooping up on neighbours using binoculars? I'd have second thoughts about liking it and would end up comparing it to ""The Woman In the Window"", which I loved.If you love reading thrillers, I'd highly recommend it. My rating: 4/5 "

I gotta say that listening audiobook is definitely the way to go with Riley Sager books, at least for me. I’ve watched Rear Window (and loved it) and I’m not bored of the new takes people have on the same concept yet, so this was a great read! Even before the mystery started, I was enjoying my time because the characters are interesting and have depth. I wasn’t expecting the twist towards the end but definitely should’ve, especially with the mention of the lake looking like a mirror at the beginning. I also liked that it took a bit of a paranormal take on the snoopy-neighbor-witnesses-something-sketch-but-no-one-believes-them trope. Definitely recommend giving this a try! And just for my personal record, I enjoyed this ending much more than Lock Every Door."

281,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32799998-erin,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 StarsThis book is incredibly polarizing, most reviews I saw for this book were negative. I assumed that I would hate this book as well...but yall.....I liked this book.First the negatives: 1.This book was hard to get into. The first 100 pages felt like they took me forever to read. 2. This book was too long. There is no reason that this book should be 350 pages. You can tell this story in 250 pages. 3. Ending seemed rushed. I understand why it was written this way but the pace but sped up too much. Now the reasons why I liked this book: The biggest reason is the same reason most people seem to hate it. The twist. First it doesn't come out of nowhere. The characters discussed this particular thing several times in the book. This location has a lore around it. Maybe I wasn't bothered by this twist because I've seen this in several movies....on Lifetime but not just on Lifetime. One of my favorite (redacted) movies is one starring Harrison Ford, I won't reveal the name because that will instantly spoil the twist. That movie like this book is also not well liked but it's a great (redacted) movie in my opinion. All of this to say, I wasn't surprised when this book changed genres because I knew that it would....I didn't know exactly how or who it would be( I thought it was going to be 1 of 3 other characters *wink* *wink*) but I knew that it was going to happen. I also suspected that our main character was hiding from more than she revealed and I never trusted a certain character that got what they deserved despite other twists. Honestly I only read this book because everyone was saying that it's Riley Sager's worst book and that he's really fallen off skill wise. This is my second Sager book, I read The Final Girl when it came out and I liked that one too but I never picked up another one because people were hyping this man to the moon and well yall know how I feel about hyped books and authors. The House Across the Lake is a fun ride. I was able to read this and just turn off my brain and enjoy. This book might just be made especially for me. I love an over the top, bonkers thriller. Was it completely realistic? No. But reality sucks and I read plenty of Nonfiction so when I read Thrillers I don't always need reality. I'm not going to recommend this book to anyone because I don't think Riley Sager needs me to hype him up. But if you enjoy over the type fun thrillers/ (redacted ) stories then don't be scared off by the bad reviews."
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4692637-fleurette,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book really surprised me. Not only was I heavily invested in the story, I was also rather comfortable with the things I usually don't like about my books.Usually I don't like when the story jumps between past and present, but this time I had absolutely no problem with that. Mostly because the chapters with the events “Now” are very short and the main plot continues in the past until the two timelines connect. This format really worked for me.Casey, with her obvious alcohol problem, could be considered another unbelievable narrator that has been abundant in thriller books lately. Again, I usually don't like it, but this time it didn't bother me. Maybe because there weren't many hints in the story that everything that happens can only be a figment of her imagination. Also, she herself did not doubt what she saw and her assessment of the situation.In the end, Casey turned out to be a very strong woman. I didn't expect some of the decisions she made. I also liked the ending and the explanation of some elements of the story. Some things I foresaw, some I did not. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience. The paranormal theme surprised me a lot. It was certainly not what I expected. In fact, I was and still am a bit disappointed that it even shows up. I would prefer the author to choose some other way to twist the plot and end the story.This is my second book by this author, I read Survive the Night. I liked this book much more. I read it really fast, much faster than I expected. And I was really invested in this story. I don't know why, but the whole story reminds me a bit of Such a Quiet Place by Megan Miranda. But I liked The House Across the Lake more."

Missed connecting flights, screaming babies on the plane, lost luggage and by the time you finally get to your destination you’re almost too exhausted to enjoy yourself? That was this book for me. A little over half of the book was painfully slow going for me. Not only does it focus on a cliché I’m tired of seeing (female MC with substance abuse questions what she sees) but it hammered us over the head with it. It was very repetitive, which makes sense when you look at the word count below…# of mentions:Drunk 38, Drink 104 Sip 45 Buzzed 10Wine 64 Bourbon 67 Vodka 10 Whisky 7Alcohol 16 Booze 7 Liquor 15Binoculars 105Glass 136 Bottle 65So much alcohol talk. What number of bourbon she’s on. Gulping bourbon. Downing wine. Thinking about drinks. Thoughts floating through her bourbon soaked brain. I feel like if it had been scaled back it wouldn’t have been as frustrating to read.The book finally does pick up and I was highly entertained by the last half of it, and I didn’t predict the outcome which is always fun. Like that travel day from hell, it was worth it for me to finally arrive at the vacation destination but I wouldn’t be in a rush to repeat it. I’d still recommend this one to thriller lovers, but be ready for the slow journey. 3/5⭐️"

I see what he was trying to do with this one, and I think some people will enjoy. I would recommend this for fans of Kiersten Modglin. The characters and the plot don't hold as much weight, but the twist will get you. So if that is what you are looking for, GOT FOR IT.Personally though, I actually despise this book. There is an element to the twist, which if I had known it going in I might have enjoyed it more, but which I feel is too spoilery to mention at all. Despite this awful twist, there were so many plot holes that I just could not look past. This felt like it was written on a whim. I understand that publishers push authors such as Riley Sager to release a book every year, this might have been an instance where he felt like he had to put something out, and unfortunately it shows.

This book had The Woman In The Window vibe all over it. It started subtlety with Casey drinking herself away at the lakehouse. Neighbours were introduced to the story to keep us guessing. Everything went on as expected and then Bang!!! Riley Sager gave us a bonkers twist and things went all haywire.This book was entertaining, I couldn't put it down.

If you were to take shots you would be blastered after the first 10 pages.The only saviour were the plot twists that caught me off guard, they were quite good and unexpected. "

Woah. This book was a little wild and far fetched but I could not put it down and therefore it got a solid 5 stars from me.

The ending especially and just all of the details had me flipping pages! I love thrillers like this that mix with paranormal. Honestly highly recommend and get your popcorn!

While the main character was unreliable, I felt she was more likable and tough than the main character in Women in the Window. I didn’t see the twist coming at all! "

304,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50780228-sarah-a-f,Rating 1 out of 5,"what the actual fuck--So I read this for Kayla's Literally Dead book club and I'm sad to say that this book and I are mortal enemies. A little dramatic perhaps, BUT I literally couldn't stand this. Casey is a recent widow who is living at her lake house because she's suffering from alcoholism and her family doesn't want to deal with her -- by the way, who sends a depressed addict to stay in an isolated house alone?? Casey thinks she sees ~things~ and is trying to solve a possible murder. Does this sound like half of the thrillers out today? Yup! 90% of the book entails Casey talking about bourbon and I was bored out of my mind. The twist is, uh, original. No one would ever guess it. Because it is barely alluded to the entire book. I need my twists to be shocking, but also something I could look back on and say, ""oh, that makes total sense!"" This made no sense. If you enjoyed this? Power to you. Could not be me. This was my first Riley Sager book and, shockingly, I will be trying another."

306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5539517-jillian-reynolds-jillian-loves-books,Rating 3 out of 5,"Thoughts upon finally reading......?I don't really have a lot to say about this one. It's my least favorite Sager book, but it's still enjoyable. It still has that page-turning quality I've come to expect from Sager's books. And while I'm not a fan of voyeurism as a theme in thrillers, Riley Sager is at the top of my auto-buy list, so I gave it a try, and it was shockingly pretty well-executed. That all being said, the pacing was a lot slower than his other books--it focuses so heavily on the main character's relationships and mental state, which are also recurring themes in his books, but slightly less enjoying in this one. I will say the BEST thing about Riley Sager books is that they're all different. We usually get an unreliable MC, and that's the only common thread. They all deal with wild scenarios and thriller tropes that are completely unrelated to each other. Every book is a wild ride on its own, and nothing ever feels stale--every single Sager book brings something unique, or a unique take on a popular trope, to the thriller genre.If you liked The Woman in the Window, The Woman on the Train, or Behind Her Eyes, you'll probably enjoy this. It was weird, it was creepy, and it delivered in the end, even if it wasn't my ALL-TIME fave. I'd still eagerly recommend this to fans of Sager's other books.Do I think this man is a genius? Would I read  a LITERAL DICTIONARY published under his name? Is this already one of my most anticipated books of 2022? In summation: Riley Sager could hit me with his car to find the plot for a new book and I would tell him, ""Thank you for your kindness, sir."""

308,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3956348-jennifer,Rating 4 out of 5,"The House Across the Lake is a thriller. It is my fifth book by this author.The narrator is Casey (1st person POV). The story has both the NOW and BEFORE timelines. Although we mostly get BEFORE.Casey is an actress who is going through a very difficult time. She is drinking a lot. She is banished to her family's lake house in Vermont where she meets Tom and Katherine.The beginning was okay. It took me a while to really become invested in the story. But the book was interesting enough that I wanted to see what happened. The drinking was excessive. And honestly I did not enjoy that aspect of the book.There were definitely things that I did like. There is a voyeurism aspect to the story. And I absolutely loved everything to do with this part of the book!The title is so good. And honestly the lake freaked me out. It was so dark and creepy!There are so few characters. Yet somehow the author managed to surprise me multiple times. There was a lot happening towards the end of this book. And I loved it! I love chapters that end with fun reveals. I love being shocked. I love saying ""what just happened!?!"" And I definitely said that a lot in this book. Overall this was a fun thriller that is a great summer read!Thank you Dutton and netgalley for allowing me to read this book."
309,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12326103-lori,Rating 4 out of 5,"Oh Mr Sager…. You’ve done it again with this suspenseful read 👍Well written with atmospheric mystery. First half of the book was a bit slow for me but Sager, as usual eventually BLOWS YOUR MIND with twists that you don’t see coming. Highy recommend another winner from Sager 🌟🌟🌟🌟Casey Fletcher, a recently widowed actress trying to escape a streak of bad press, has retreated to the peace and quiet of her family’s lake house in Vermont. Armed with a pair of binoculars and several bottles of bourbon, she passes the time watching Tom and Katherine Royce, the glamorous couple living in the house across the lake. They make for good viewing—a tech innovator, Tom is powerful; and a former model, Katherine is gorgeous.One day on the lake, Casey saves Katherine from drowning, and the two strike up a budding friendship. But the more they get to know each other—and the longer Casey watches—it becomes clear that Katherine and Tom’s marriage isn’t as perfect as it appears. When Katherine suddenly vanishes, Casey immediately suspects Tom of foul play. What she doesn’t realize is that there’s more to the story than meets the eye—and that shocking secrets can lurk beneath the most placid of surfaces. "

I’m still trying to come to terms with what actually happened in this book! 😳 This won’t be my last Sager read. For that TWIST that I NEVER saw coming I’m giving this 5 stars alone. This book was the perfect mix of creepy and clever. I can see how some might not like the twist (I’m trying to make sure I don’t spoil it) and the story could have been a great read without the twist - but I did personally love it!! Casey Fletcher is a recently widowed actress with a drinking problem and a habit of watching her neighbors a little too closely. She saves her super model neighbor from drowning and the events that transpire afterwards will make you question everything and everyone! There was a lot packed into this book and I nearly read the whole thing in one day because I couldn’t wait to see what happened next. This book was unpredictable in the best of ways. I highly recommend! "

Podchodząc do lektury książki, nie miałam zbyt dużych oczekiwań. Powodem było to, że pozycja miała bardzo, ale to bardzo mieszane opinie.  Jednakże uważam, że jedyną wadą, jaką znalazłam w tej powieści jest to, że czytało się ją wolno. Wiem, iż niektórym może przeszkadzać, jak duży w tej książce jest nacisk na alkoholizm głównej bohaterki i występują rozdziały, które dosłownie w połowie zajęte są mieszaniem wódkę z burbonem.Jednak ostatecznie to dzieje się w tej książce jest genialne! Na 200 któreś tam stronie mamy wątek paranormalny, który bardzo mi się spodobał, a ja jestem człowiekiem, który czyta kryminały thrillery, zna się na tym, ale jeżeli mam czytać grozę typu Stephen King, to po czterech czterech stronach mam schizę na pół roku. Tutaj ten wątek paranormalny w ogóle mnie nie przestraszył ale był dreszczyk emocji. Więc polecam polecam jeszcze raz polecam!"
312,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3915406-jen,Rating 5 out of 5,"I received this from the Publisher in exchange for an honest review. I think this is one of Riley‘s favorite books that I’ve ever read. I love that he continues to add nods to old movie genres in his books. I think people that love the old movies that are featured, such as Rear Window in this one, will really enjoy being able to revisit a movie that they loved inside of a book.This book was finished in three sittings and would’ve been finished in two, but I actually had to get up an adult and do some things. However, without giving anything away I will say that I was kept completely entertained, turning the pages, and completely surprised by the turn of events. You should go into this one blind and just not expect anything because the unexpected will happen."
313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14670631-crystal,Rating 5 out of 5,"I freaking love this book! In fact, it's my favorite Sager book since The Last Time I Lied (which is saying a lot because I love all his books). So the premise sounds a lot like The Woman in the Window, which had me worried because it's an overused and tired trope at this point. While this story was indeed an homage to Rear Window, it definitely wasn't a blatant copy of every other book that had done it in recent history. In addition to Rear Window, there are plenty of other horror movie references (much like Sager's other books). And the Evil Dead reference still has me losing my mind! The ending to this one is wild. I love it! I love everything about it! And this is, hands down, my favorite read of 2022."

Wonderfully written one thing after another but than it all tying together in the end love that.If you are hesitant to read this go into it blind don’t read the reviews just take that chance either you’ll devour this bookor you won’t.🤷🏼‍♀️

If you sink under, you'll never come back up again. You'll be trapped forever.""Casey, after losing her husband and publicly loosing herself to alcoholism, for some reason goes back to the lake house where it all began to drink herself into stupor in peace, becomes obsessed with the hot couple across the lake, oh and also has a hot, recently widowed ex-cop as another bonus right next door. (Did I mention that everybody's hot. Because the author definitely wanted to make sure that we knew that everybody is hot.) And of course things happen, Casey is the only one to realize it, and tries to get everybody out of the mess she sort-of accidentally created.Definitely the weakest Riley Sager book I've ever read. And I never connect, enjoy, or even like his Main Characters, but Casey was an entirely different mess altogether. Her whole attitude of ""I know I'm a mess so it's not an issue"" look on life just made me irritated. The only people I liked interacting with were Katherine and Detective Wilma. I just wish more of his characters had that type of personality. And don't get me started on that plot twist. It was so far out of left field it actually cost it a star. It just made me angry and seemed like a weak reveal to make everything make sense. You're better off reading Survive the Night, or The Last Time I Lied if you really want to experience Sager's best work."

To be honest, R.S is well known for his over the top, twist after twist novels but the supernatural element just didn’t work for me. There were so many discrepancies and pot holes in the plot, it was hard to ignore. The main character was astonishing. She would drink and drink and drink all day long and yet just in split second would be totally lucid and sober to the point where she would do things that would be impossible for a drunk person to do. Her vision would be perfect, her senses would be completely alert, her body would be completely in control. It simply didn’t sound plausible. The ending was… hmm… kind of OK. Typical R.S ending. Tied everything together in a perfect bow. However the ending didn’t work for me as well. Kind of cheesy and kind of too perfect. I hope you will enjoy it more than me. 🍷Happy Thanksgiving 🍁🦃 to my US friends."

What she observes brings up more questions than answers.Casey is the prime example of an unreliable narrator. Her days of drinking bourbon after bourbon make you question if anything she sees can be taken at any value. She has a complicated past, and as we learn more about her neighbors on the lake, so do the others on Lake Greene. Riley Sager gets you with twist after twist in this novel.
