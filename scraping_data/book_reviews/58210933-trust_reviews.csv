0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42130592-chai,Rating 5 out of 5,"Every now and then, when I am lucky, I will come across a novel that will completely blast my readerly expectations from their mooring. These are the novels that disrupt business as usual, that slip from their reviewers’ grasp and revel in making it difficult to talk about them because they refuse to be metabolized into a digestible précis or be reducible to an easy categorization. I am drawn to all the ways these novels do this: refuse to satisfy conventional narrative expectations, defy our sense of what fiction and narrative can and should be, and in doing so reveal the potent and important work of language that cracks open locked doors and brings us face to face with the world that both unites and divides us—and with ourselves.Hernan Diaz’s smart, moving and formally daring novel, Trust, is such a novel.In the widest view, Trust offers a searing look at the gravitational pull of money and its ability to “bend and align reality itself”; in the smallest view, it disorients and disrupts formal genre distinctions to unsettle and resettle the long-standing myths that surround American financial power and excavate the unnamed and faceless histories that are buried beneath their constraining weight.The structure of Trust might be a good place to begin a cursory investigation of what makes this novel so extraordinary. On its face, Trust tells the story of a wealthy financier and his rise to outrageous monetary heights during the Great Depression of 1929. What follows might have been, in any other novel, a straightforward narrative, like a hammer to a nail: the archetypical tale of the American Dream that highlights the individualism and determination of the “self-made” American man. Diaz, however, fractures that story instead, spilling it across multiple genres: a novel, a memoir draft, a memoir, and finally, a diary. By the time we think we know what the story is about, the frame has already shifted, and the story has become something else. And then something else again. And then something else again. With each turn of the frame, a new angle of glare is revealed. In other words, the frames are not decorative—they are borne out of necessity. They rise out of a deeper silence, and make possible sounds that could not otherwise be articulated. The frames speak against erasure. I am mesmerized by the fierce intelligence with which Diaz addresses multiple facets of this erasure. How its echo, shadow, and silent force permeates the novel’s structure, tone, and theme. Early on, the novel establishes a “truth,” which is to say a story, only to then gradually begin to dismantle it, unwinding it in long threads of half-truths and half-lies across the page, all tangled but legible. In a slow surge, which later becomes a flood, we begin to have an acute sense that there is much more being said than what we are given access to, that there are words behind the words we are reading. Something crucial is being withheld; we are not entirely sure what. This might be frustrating for some readers, but the anticipation of discovery is far more compelling: we must go in to find out.Therein lies, I think, the genuinely subversive quality of this novel (and half the joy of reading it): in its determined attention to the gaps, the silences, the evasions, and how it posits these gaps and silences and evasions—this edge of unfinished business—as a challenge to the reader to find out the truth, and most crucially, to avoid complicity in the erasures effected by the story.  Most narratives about money-making and the American dream of the self-sufficient white man are curiously silent about the origins of that money, and what set of conditions make it possible for the white man to remain self-sufficient. This inherent resistance to the topic is borne out of a perverse sense of self-preservation, saving these narratives from having to grapple with (or even acknowledge) any part of the question, either explicit or implied, of whose stolen labor is made serviceable, and what social relations are being concealed, for the realization of that story. It reassures the people and institutions complicit in this erasure, in other words, that they will never have to wake up to their record and face their responsibilities.  It is out of that void that Diaz’s novel leaps, cutting through the bright false stories around it, and asking it plain: whose voice is being heard just by virtue of being loud, and whose voice is stiffened into silence in the violent aftermath? Whose story is being foregrounded, and whose material presence is only dimly perceived or otherwise obscured from view altogether? Whose authoritative gaze is controlling these narratives—what do they reinforce, and what do they consistently fail to see? More important: how does our perception—our too-often easy uncritical acceptance—of what is truth and what is fiction shape our knowledge of ourselves and of the world at large? These are the open questions that the novel asks us to sit inside and bear witness to. Trust is not necessarily invested in providing all the answers; by the end of the novel, we don’t so much land somewhere as just keep falling. What Trust offers us instead is a plurality of narratives that chart the complexity of our lives and seek to represent the true face of our history. It’s an invitation to reject—or at the very least be skeptical of—the authority of all-encompassing narratives, and to always look for the stories trapped underneath, or otherwise shoved to the ill-lit margins. Trust is an exercise, ultimately, in excavating truth, wherever it’s hidden. To do the opposite of what the title tempts us to do, which is to say—to never trust."

The novel consists of four parts - a novel-within-a-novel, sketches of an autobiography, a memoir, and a journal. Each successive entry peels back a layer of the story to ultimately reveal the truth behind the original novel. It sounds great as a premise, but the book as written doesn't quite match the compelling setup. The first problem is that the faux novel is just plain silly, with bursts of melodrama and written in a deliberately stylized manner, like a bad Edith Wharton pastiche. Andrew Bevel, the fictional character who is the subject of all this, is never sympathetic, even behind a façade, so we aren't surprised by later revelations. Showing that a wealthy financier isn't all he's cracked up to be is hardly revelatory. This would have been far more interesting if the first sections presented compelling characters and a myth that readers could get behind, only to strip it away later. Instead, we get a cartoonish setup, uninspiring characters, and an ending we all knew was coming."

I also loved the idea of reading multiple rashomon-like reveals and revelations, and I read along in the beginning with great anticipation, and tried to retain my interest long enough to get to the next passage or sentence or anything at all that might remind me of how much I loved Díaz's debut...But there were longer and longer interludes between the sparkly places.In the end I was dragged down by the dull-sludge sections, and unable to make more excuses for this novel and its disappointments. The novel's conceit relies on the first section, Bonds, being a novel that I can imagine people wanting to read in 1938. I couldn't imagine it. It feels fusty and restrained and underdone. It has no sustained emotional depth. It reads more like a long encyclopedia entry about the Rasks. I didn't believe it was interesting or important or revealing enough to be a novel that the 'real' Benjamin Rask, Andrew Bevel, would bother to care about.But the section that disappointed me most was the last section, where we get scraps of Mildred Bevel's diary. I'd held onto the hope that in this last part the novel would finally break out of the intellectual straightjacket Díaz had forced his writing to conform to. I fully expected the novel would finally lift itself out of the mundane slog, and into something revelatory, and beautiful--but instead it just flopped around, like a fish drowning in air, and died."

We triumph, but it is not really we who fail—we are ruined by forces beyond our control.""I’ll admit that I had put this book aside when I first received it a month ago. The subject matter- financial markets, Wall Street tycoon, the crash of 1929- wasn’t pulling me in. But eventually, my curiosity got the better of me and I finally cracked it open three days ago and I have been immersed in it ever since. This is a book that takes time and patience. I did put it down a few times – not because I lost interest but because I needed to take a pause and absorb what I was reading. In general, I enjoy meta fiction when it is done right and Hernan Diaz takes meta fiction to a different level altogether with “Trust”.It is hard to summarise this book without giving too much away. The plot revolves around a successful financier (and his wife) who not only survived the crash of 1929 but thrived and added to their wealth through well-timed investment decisions. He attributes his success to his strong intuitive capabilities, intense research and his acute understanding of the financial world. Needless to say, reaping profits in an era wherein the economy collapsed and investors and businesses lost substantial amounts of money, does invite questions and conjecture directed toward his investment practices, even inspiring fiction based on the life and times of said person with distorted facts and whole a lot of speculation. Now how does one protect his image and manage public perception? Who is he trying to convince? – Those in his close circle? Business associates? Family members? Himself? “Trust” is a complex, layered novel divided into four parts- four distinct narrative styles in four distinct voices. This novel is composed of four intricately woven novels/segments - each presenting a different perspective on the events center to the plot - a work of fiction inspired by the main character and his wife, an incomplete draft of an autobiography written by the egotistical protagonist, a memoir written by the young woman hired by the main character as his biographer and the final segment is a part of the diary of the financier’s late wife. As the narrative progresses, and the line between fact and fiction gets blurred, which version of the events and the people involved rings true? Whose version can you trust? With its unique structure, elegant writing, interesting characters (even the immensely unlikable protagonist) and the 1920s setting, Hernan Diaz’s Trust is a sharp, compelling and creative work of fiction. The first part of the novel does not quite give the reader an idea of the complexity and the intrigue of the plot that lies ahead. The final two parts of the novel were my favorite and the most absorbing part(s) of the book. I will definitely be looking out for more from this author. “Every life is organized around a small number of events that either propel us or bring us to a grinding halt. We spend the years between these episodes benefiting or suffering from their consequences until the arrival of the next forceful moment.”"
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59050228-meike,Rating 2 out of 5,"Joint Winner of the Pulitzer Prize 2023 with the equally simplistic Demon Copperhead Longlisted for the Booker Prize 2022Listen, God knows I was all here for a four-part experimental novel about American finance and wealth, the cover showing 30 Rock under a snow globe/glass dome of a stock ticker with fog promised intelligent fun about money as a global narrative that materializes all around us. Unfortunately, the complex topic of American wealth, its roots and repercussions, was then dealt with on a rather superficial level, and, even worse, the whole construct rests on a novel-within-a-novel that reads as if Edith Wharton now writes Wikipedia entries. Let's quickly sum this book up: The first part is a presented as a bestseller from the 1930's, telling the story of eccentric Wall Street tycoon Benjamin Rask who, between the turn of the century and 1930, has amassed insane wealth. He marries a brilliant woman named Helen, who starts to suffer from mental illness, which then leads to sinister The Magic Mountain references as well as musings about the history of psychology and neurology. This part emulates the style of Henry James and Edith Wharton, but the pastiche is (intentionally?) so clumsily done that I would have bailed right there if I didn't know there were completely different parts to come.The second part is the manuscript of the autobiography of Andrew Bevel, who turns out to be the real-life Benjamin Rask. It'a also unpleasant to read, as it mainly serves to establish the differences between the fictionalized Bevel in part one and the differently fictionalized Bevel as he wanted to be perceived by the world. Here, we get lots of references to the insufferable Ayn Rand and her ramblings about ethical egotism à la ""my wealth proves how much I have done for the nation"". With John Oliver, I ask: How is this still a thing? Bevel frames his wife in the constraints of her time and, surprise, is also a blatant misogynist. Then, in part three, women finally get a voice, as it is told by Ida Partenza, the ghostwriter of the manuscript in part two (are you still following, class? :-)). Here, we learn how she was tasked to craft the autobiography of Bevel, and what Bevel wanted to achieve with it. Also, the Rand-like character of Bevel is contrasted with Ida's dad, an Italian anarchist, and her lover, a dedicated opportunist masquerading as a leftist-type of guy. Stuff is said about Karl Marx, and as as someone who studied PoliSci in Karl's hometown, my arm now hurts because of all the facepalming I had to do due to the simplistic ideas about Marxism uttered in this text. In the last part, Bevel's wife, Mildred (who became Helen as a fictionalized version in part one) gets a say, and we finally learn who she, the person at the heart of the novel, really was - from her point of view, not according to male-dominated fictions. The much discussed plot twist is not really a twist though, because you see it coming from a mile away. Maybe two stars really is too harsh a verdict, because there were passages I enjoyed reading (especially in part three), but the overall narrative idea is way more appealing than the execution. I was missing deeper insights on the belief systems tackled here - unrestrained capitalism, Marxism, Italian anarchism - or the sociopolitical context, or at least the finance system as such. The characters themselves are rendered as ciphers, which is not a problem per se, but then they really have to stand for something complex.At the end of the day, money is a social construct and a medium: We ascribe value to it in a complex system of social agreements - which is the connection between money and language. This is also the connex between the myth of the American dream and the cult of wealth. But the novel does not really explore these topics, it remains superficial and safe by criticizing Wall Street in an undercomplex manner and turning far-left ideologies into quirky sideshows, and then adds some feminist critique about the role of women when it comes to writing the lives of so-called ""great men"" (a topic widely researched by the first scientist to focus on what we now call toxic masculinity, Klaus Theweleit). What a missed opportunity."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill,Rating 5 out of 5,"This brilliant metafiction book is about a lot of things, but among the most prominent is the bending and aligning of reality according to one’s mistakes so it ceases to be a mistake. What are the fictions that compose our identity? Or do our lives eventually become the written and verbal fictions that others craft?Since I am an early reader, I had the joy of discovering the alchemy created by Hernan Diaz without any advance knowledge or perceptions. In this review, I’m going to try hard to ensure that others are equally spellbound by some of the more intriguing shifts.At the start, the author pays evident homage to Edith Wharton in his presentation of the legendary financier Benjamin Rask. In unadorned but elegant prose, we learn the story of Rask’s ascension to the economic stratosphere (of course, it didn’t hurt that he was born into family money) and the influence of his wife, Helen, who hails from a family of old money that is now in a precarious state. So convincing is that portrayal that I actually Googled this couple, and when the results proved lacking, I refreshed and googled again.For nearly 100 pages, we are immersed in their compelling story but I have to admit I thought, “Okay, good writing that’s rather evocative. But what’s the big deal?”The “big deal” is revealed through the next three sections – revealed in a novel-within-a-novel, an unfinished manuscript, a memoir, and finally a diary – as other narrators take the stage. As layer upon layer is added, we view the first 100 pages with whole new eyes. Who the narrators are – and what is revealed – is for the reader to discover.Certain themes and motifs begin to repeat. One surrounds the allure of money: is it merely a fiction – a dirty stack of bills that we use as a measure to value all other commodities? Does that then make finance capital a fiction of a fiction? Or is it the god of commodities and the foundation of making all things possible?For those (to coin Thomas Wolfe) “masters of the universe”, how do we separate the ever-present myths from the realities? Where do the women who stand with them fit in? Why force women into stereotypes , putting them in their place for the purpose of providing a better story of themselves for history? And finally, are we all complicit in the stories we create if the price is high enough? The more I consider this novel, the more blown away I am with it. It is an exhilarating read that goes to the very core of distinguishing fact from fiction. I owe a debt of gratitude to Riverhead Books, an imprint of Penguin Random House, for providing me with the privilege of being an advance reader in exchange for an honest review. I’ve no doubt this book will make my Top Ten this year."

There is nothing new to be found here about gender or wealth. We need a book like this in 2022? It's just the author sort of patting himself on the back for reaching the most basic level of conclusions about these topics. ""People with money get to control the narrative!"" ""Women are treated like props for men!"" ""Behind every great man is a woman!""...So? Trite, flat characters...a whole section that is entirely skippable. Just skip the whole book."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher,Rating 1 out of 5,"Joint winner of the Pulitzer PrizeWhich doesn’t suggest American fiction is in a very healthy state. Trust by Hernan Diaz has an interesting, and in some respects brave, structure, albeit one that many readers have commented seems to have been borrowed from Susan Choi's Trust Exercise, which is perhaps a clever metafictional approach given metafictional clumsiness is at the heart of the novel, as is the theme of men taking credit for women's achievements.The second best way to read this book might to be to do without foreknowledge of this structure, but the high level of publicity and authorial interviews makes that difficult, and so I will cover it in my review. Although the best way might be not to read it at all - of a book published at the same time, The Unauthorised Biography of Ezra Maas does something similar but is much more accomplished.The novel is split into four parts, three of them novellas and the last a brief coda:Bonds by Harold Vanner My Life by Andrew BevelA Memoir Remembered by Ida Partenza Futures by Mildred BevelBonds is the loosely fictionalised biography (fictional even within the novel's world) of a 1920-30s Wall Street tycoon Benjamin Rask and his wife Helen, published (in the novel's world) in the early 1930s. It is written in the style of an Edith Wharton, although Vanner (and perhaps also Diaz?) is a poor imitator of her prose, and the novella is (deliberately?) badly written.Rask is based on the real-life (in the novel's world - I will stop adding that for fear of this review becoming as tedious as Vanner's prose) Andrew Bevel, whose late wife was called Mildred. And who I kept wanting to call Mildred Revel as my Proustian recollection of those delicious chocolates - except the coffee one - was the only good thing from the book.And My Life is Bevel's own autobiographical account, designed to counter Vanner's scurrilous portrayal, both of Andrew Bevel's part in the late 1920s Wall Street crash but also Vanner's version of Mildred, who Vanner has dying after severe mental health problems, but who Vanner portrays as a simple, but kindly soul. Or rather My Life is a partly completed account, with lots of 'add some anecdotes here' type comments left in the manuscript for example:His unique, discreetly creative approach. Free Banking Era. Opportunities in currency fluctuation, etc. 2–3 examples.Again this isn't a great read as the tone is deliberately rather pompous and (disappointingly) in both sections, the details of the operation of the stock market during the fascinating memoir are as sketchy as parts of Bevel's incomplete work. Hence my 'brave' comment earlier - for the reader, a pastiche of a badly written book is still a badly written book. Although both Bonds and My Life are quick reads, ideally skimmed, as there is seldom a word which isn't wasted.The third part is the novel's “highlight” although that is damning with faint praise. Ida Partenza proves to be Bevel's typist (as he would have seen her) or ghost-writer (in reality), responsible for My Life. In A Memoir Remembered she is recounting, decades later, how she became involved with Bevel and with his autobiography. Parts of this story were compelling, although a side story involving her jealous boyfriend, a journalist, seemed more designed to set up part four of the book, rather than add anything, and that of her Italian anarchist father felt like it belonged to another book.The reminisces on the past in A Memoir Remembered are interspersed with Partenza's account of contemporary visit to the Bevel's former home, now turned into a museum. There she finds a diary written by Mildred Bevel.And the novel's brief final section is that diary, written from the Swiss sanitorium where Mildred (and Helen, albeit from a different cause) ended her days. And this section contains a revelation that had been heavy-handedly signposted throughout - again this seems to be deliberately. Ultimately, very disappointing, at times deliberately so. 1 star - rounded down for its apperance on an otherwise strong Booker list.Thanks to the publisher via Netgalley for the ARC."

Everything about this cunning story makes a mockery of its title. The only certainty here is Diaz’s brilliance and the value of his rewarding book.Though framed as a novel, “Trust” is actually an intricately constructed quartet of stories — what Wall Street traders would call a 4-for-1 stock split.The first part is a novella titled “Bonds,” presented as the work by a now forgotten writer in the 1930s named Harold Vanner. A pastiche of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s and Edith Wharton’s fiction, the story luxuriates in the tragic fate of America’s wealthiest man, Benjamin Rask. The opening line immediately signals the narrator’s mingled awe and reproof: “Because he had enjoyed almost every advantage since birth, one of the few privileges denied to Benjamin Rask was that of a heroic rise.”Diaz, writing as Vanner, spins the legend of an icy, isolated young man who quickly masters the levers of finance to transform his “respectable inheritance” into an unimaginably large estate. “His colleagues thought him. . . .To read the rest of this review, go to The Washington Post:https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/..."

If you can find someone in finance who reads they are likely to read non-fiction books with possible some genre fiction – and similarly few literary fiction books even cover finance. Of those that do many seem to misunderstand it (for example confusing the direction of interest rate change impacts) – and even my book of 2022 Natasha Brown’s “Assembly” uses banking as a canvas on which to focus a social mobility/meritocracy lens on the topic of colonialism and its lasting impacts (eg we do not know what job the unnamed narrator does for her bank – just her seniority).So I welcome this book’s explicit aim to address that divide and to provide a literary exploration of capital, investment and banking and via one dictionary definition of the title. The author has further stated his aim as examining and deconstructing one of the foundational myths/classic American narratives of American society (the role of free market capitalism and the investment markets and particularly the self-made wealthy entrepreneur) in the same way that his first novel “In The Distance” did with the Western.At the same time the author wanted to examine the other definition of Trust and in particular the idea of the trust that it is implicit in fiction and reading “Reading is always an act of trust. Whenever we read anything, from a novel to the label on a prescription bottle, trust is involved. That trust is based on tacit contracts whose clauses I wanted to encourage the reader to reconsider. As you read Trust and move forward from one section to the next, it becomes clear that the book is asking you to question the assumptions with which you walk into a text.”Because this is a book written in four very different parts – each with a different writer, a different narrative voice, a different style and a different purpose. The Washington Post and leading Goodreads reviewer Ron Charles in his review says this quartet of very different stories is “what Wall Street Traders would call a 4-for-1 stock split” – thus illustrating perfectly my contended literature/finance divide, given that split into four identical parts is almost the exact opposite to what Diaz does. Interesting though I think some form of more identical split would have worked much better here (see later).The book starts with around a 100 page pastiche of (or possibly tribute to) Edith Wharton and her fiction which not only documented the Gilded Age of America but which was towards the end of the literary realism movement – a novel called “Bonds” by Harold Vanner which tells the story of a Wall Street banker/trader/tycoon Benjamin Rask – his taking advantage of the 1920s bull market and then his more controversial role in the 1929 Crash; alongside the story of his art patron/philanthropist wife Helen and her mental instability and treatment for that in Europe.The second section is around a 100 page pastiche (and in this case definitely not a tribute to) the self-aggrandising (if unfinished) business autobiography of a Wall Street banker/trader/tycoon Andrew Revel – his role in growing the nation’s prosperity by helping the 1920s bull market and then his saddened realisation that speculation had driven the market too high leading him to evade the 1929 Crash; alongside the story of his art patron/philanthropist late-wife Mildred and her emotional and mental stability ahead of her treatment for cancer in Europe.The third section (and easily the strongest of the book) is written by Ida Partenza – the daughter of an Italian anarchist effectively in America as a political refugee – she is hired by Revel to write the second part of the novel as a counterbalance to the sensationalist impact of the first (which he and everyone else regards as his lightly fictionalised biography). While researching the book (to the limited permitted by Revel who wishes to tightly control the narrative) Ida finds that neither Vanner or Revel’s portrayal of Mildred seems to meet the complexity of her character but is unable to discover the true Mildred. Parts of this section are narrated closer to our present day as the now elderly Ida visits a museum made of the Revel home (where she wrote her book) and explores the archives.The fourth and shortest part of the book (albeit still much stronger than the first two) is Ida’s final discovery – a very fragmentary diary written by Mildred before her death, while being treated in Europe, which contains a revelation as to the real story of Revel (and his roles in both the bull market and crash) which to be honest has been pretty easy to guess from the beginning. As I have implied this is a book of two halves – the first two sections for me were very weak although mercifully easy to skip through at a quick pace, as my brother’s review says “there is barely a word that is not wasted”. In the first section in particular I started writing down passages and turns of phrase that annoyed me before deciding to go for the pastiche rather than tribute option. What I was less clear on was the author’s decision to lead with the entirety of the two sections rather than having the four sections interleaved through the novel. I believe the aim was to draw the reader into each story and to the world it posits before revealing another layer of the story – but neither for me was sufficiently well written to draw me in so spoiling the effect. Further there are by now myriad mainstream media and Goodreads reviews which make the set up of the first two parts (as revealed in the third) clear which also negated any impact of revelation – and in some ways that is anyway to the book’s benefits as I think many modern readers taking the first section (at least) on face value may well have bailed. I am sure there is a point for this – as the book itself says “the worst literature, my father would say, is always written with the best intentions”.The obviousness of the “reveal” in the fourth section I can live with better – as the book seems to strongly signpost this by discussing (on two separate but importantly linked occasions) someone recounting a detective style novel and someone else (older or wiser) having to effectively pretend that the reveal of the murderer is a surprise.There is though a lot to like in the novel in terms of its concept – both at a macro and more micro level.On the overall level I liked (while not thinking it entirely worked) the ideas of linking the sustained and collective illusion (or perhaps collective decision to place collective faith in a narrative) that lies behind not just fictional stories themselves, but non-fictional accounts, behind national (and national identity) stories, behind political movements and also behind financial markets. On the micro level I enjoyed for example: the exploration of the marginalisation of (and even worse co-opting or blatant stealing of) female voices and ideas; the idea that a blend of human psychology with mathematical analysis is key to investment success (and it reminded me of the intersection of art-empathy-gut call & data-science-hard facts at the heart of commercial insurance underwriting); the fragmentary ideas in the fourth section about the transition from literary realism to literary modernism (and its equivalent in music).My thanks to Panmacmillan for an ARC via NetGalley"
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38055348-lea,Rating 3 out of 5,"”One’s reality is another’s delusion.”In the complexities of human perception, one's reality often serves as the elusive counterpart to another's delusion. We all grapple with the fine balance between subjectivity and the quest for objective truth, assuming one believes in its existence.”Trust” is an interesting experimental novel that endeavors to navigate the labyrinthine corridors of perception, trying to echo the works of literary greats in the process. Diaz boldly embarks on an ambitious quest to weave a postmodern tapestry within the traditional fabric of the American novel, and sometimes disappointingly falls flat in the process.  Rooted in the opulence and fervor of 1920s New York, his narrative is evidently inspired by Wharton and Fitzgerald, immersing itself in the quintessential American dream—an ethos of egoistical capitalism and individualism espoused by the enigmatic and highly controversial Ayn Rand. Rand is often hated for openly verbalizing the core beliefs that drive the modern world. Within this milieu, status and purpose are found in the Gatsbyan pursuit of wealth, a narrative where money, in its irrational accumulation, makes the very fabric of reality.If you are enough entrenched in self-serving maxims, you too can live the American dream and be the ideal of a “self-made” man. The central figures of the novel, Andrew and Helen Bevel, a New York financier and his wife, stand as the embodiment of this ethos possessing wealth surpassing the GDP of entire nations. Money, in Diaz's narrative, transcends its material constraints, evolving into a numinous force that purchases not only worldly goods but the respect and heroic stature coveted by society. It purchases a new version of reality, a promise of a new version of self. In a philosophical reverie, Diaz contemplates the metaphysical underpinnings of money and its entanglement with the power structures of finance, connecting its ontology to considerations about inequality and other real-life issues. Money often deemed the most intimate and private of subjects, becomes the focal point of introspection. “Money. What is money?” he would mutter to himself. “Commodities in a purely fantastic form.”What is the thing that makes money rule all and what makes it create such mythical creatures as Musk, Bezos, Gates, or anyone who accumulates wealth above all measure? The possession of substantial wealth transcends mere affluence; it constitutes a multidimensional state that extends beyond material opulence. In the modern world, rich people become saints of capitalism on whose altar many will bow their knees in restless pursuit of the obsession of more. An insatiable hunger lurks beneath the veneer of ambition. We crave more—more recognition, more possessions, more moments of fleeting ecstasy. It's the ceaseless pursuit of the 'I,' the insistent tug of a selfhood hungry for validation in a marketplace teeming with competing egos.The novel's thematic core delves into the symbiotic relationship between money and fiction, unveiling the role of wealth and power in ”bending and aligning reality itself” to one’s will. In the labyrinth of egoistic capitalism, the appetite for more is not merely a preference; it's a manifesto, a declaration of existence in a world that measures worth in quantifiable increments. We navigate this societal bazaar with a shopping cart of desires, each acquisition a testament to our standing in the grand bazaar of self-importance.Yet, in this relentless pursuit, we may find ourselves ensnared in the paradox of plenty—amidst abundance, a gnawing emptiness persists. The 'more' we accumulate becomes a fleeting mirage, dissipating just as we approach its shimmering allure.”Trust” delves into the trap of the human spirit that money represents—a modern-day holy grail, a philosopher's stone, that fails to deliver to promise of ecstasy and transfiguration. The narrative prods readers to ponder the transformative power of immense fortune and its potential to shape any future one wants, or thinks they want. The illusion of wealth becomes shattered in rich man's dystopian future as a poignant reflection on the isolation it begets—a lonely existence where the blanket of one's public image serves as the sole comfort, rendering the individual a mere projection of society's idea of success and freedom, without the person's grasp of the true essence of those values. ”So if money is fiction, finance capital is the fiction of a fiction. That's what all those criminals trade in: fictions... Money is at the core of it all. An illusion we've all agreed to support. Unanimously.”The tragic narrative arc of Andrew Bevel, reminiscent of Gatsby's ill-fated pursuit, unfolds as a pursuit of his own ghostly image. Wealth begets the power to construct false narratives that offer a semblance of freedom from the judgments of others. Yet, like Gatsby, the wealth fails to liberate him from the shackles of self-deception and a reluctance to confront the fundamental truths of his existence. Yes, as Bevel and Gatsby, one can have all the worldly power and wealth, and still be overwhelmed and riddled with shame, desperately clinging to other people's perception of themselves to the point of addiction. The more accolades amassed, the more self-hate seems to gather in the shadowy recesses of the psyche, a paradoxical companion to the glitz and glamour.They, adorned in the regalia of influence, find themselves desperately clutching to the perceptions of others as if they were a lifeline. It's an addiction, an insidious yearning for external validation to stave off the encroaching tide of self-doubt. The more eyes applaud, the more hollow the applause seems to ring. In the pursuit of worldly triumphs, the corridors of power become a labyrinth of self-deception.As the narrative unfolds in a Rashomonian structure, Diaz probes the essential question: Whose narrative should we Trust? In the metafictional legacy of Borges and Calvino, the novel fragments into four different parts with distinct narratives and voices that are in communication with each other. Each part interrogates the reliability of the other, creating a literary kaleidoscope that challenges the reader's perception. The narrators of almost all parts either are or could be considered unreliable with unpure motives. There is also a shift in literary style, the first part being a self-proclaimed hommage to Warthon, Henry James and Fitzgerald, but in reality, landing more closely to the style of Taylor Jenkins Raid than the literary titans.The second part is meant to be informative and dry, written by Ida, Bevel's ghostwriter, a fabricated reality of what our protagonist wanted to be the truth about him and his wife’s life, inspired by the autobiographical style of great men of American history that Bevel wholeheartedly wants to be remembered as.In the third part, a memoir by Ida, Bevel’s ghostwriter, more truth is presumingly revealed, and in Ida’s memoir, the writing style becomes more modern, philosophical and reflective. Marx is mentioned as Diaz’s influence and this section gives a commentary on capitalism and its leftist critique in the voice of Ida's anarchist father. Here the other fundamental idea of a novel is revealed - the greatness of women hidden in history written by men. The bending of a woman’s character to fit into the myth the man in her life needed for himself. Complicated search for the truth of women’s lives and their own voices in men male-dominated world. But Ida has many motives for being unreliable, emotionally involved, and appalled by male narratives that dominate the world. Her writing is inspired by detective fiction she adored in youth, by Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers: “These women showed me I did not have to conform to the stereotypical notions of the feminine world.… They showed me that there was no reward in being reliable or obedient: The reader’s expectations and demands were there to be intentionally confounded and subverted.”The grand finale of the book is a disjointed narrative of dying Mildred Bevel's morphine-addled diary, which serves as the crescendo of revelation—her nonlinear perspective where past, present, and future coalesce in a feverish dreamscape.Influenced by feminist literary giants such as Woolf, Rhys and Lessing, this section unveils the untold stories of women relegated to the shadows of history—a secret creative force behind the lives of men. “Short selling is folding back time. The past making itself present in the future.”In the tradition of Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper this section plays in the idea of women locked behind doors which is the generative power of men’s lives. The genius women whose voices were marginalized, silenced, made appear mad like a woman in the attic through history - voices of women we may only hear distorted - through the stories of their successful husbands or in no way at all. The genius of women who rule from the shadows, often unclaimed and unrecognized by the collective, still contains the intellectual fuel for men. Helen’s voice brings the unnamed and untold stories buried beneath American financial power.Here achievement and money are not essential - being is.In the metanarrative of the novel, the same question is posed again and again, whose narrative do we Trust? From what I gathered, all the readers seem to consider the last part of the novel it great reveal - a reveal of the truth so concealed in previous voices. But I can’t help but wonder why. Because the last two sections are written by women? Because they are written in a more appealing, literary, postmodern style? Because the last part was written by a dying woman? We often forget that women also have their own mythologies of their identities - sometimes containing inflation of their own. They can also be threatened by the power of men and create their own grandiose narrative of themselves. Marriages are complex and our perceptions of ourselves as partners are full of fallacies. Reader's reactions seem to attest that we can be inclined to put the subjectivity of women at the altar of truth, equalizing it with objective reality. The marginalization of certain narratives in history doesn't inherently imbue them with an infallible veracity. The authoritative gaze of men has long shaped history, yet what contemporary forces dictate our narrative preferences, tethering us to one story over another? Is our embrace of fiction marked by an unsettling ease, a tendency to accept without due scrutiny? The fallacy in our convictions, whether about heroes, victims, or the truth we hold, demands a painful awareness—a call for unwavering critical examination.We seem to be in our own inner conflict of wanting to believe the powerful but also, especially in recent eras, being inclined to take a side of those marginalized, traumatized, the underdogs, those who are sick and suffer even when our logic tells us they hold important, but only one piece of the puzzle of reality, equally locked in their own subjective experience.It is important to bring the validity of the plurality of narratives that chart the complexity of truth, in history much as in the present day. While reading this book you can also observe how easily it is to discard the narrative of the person you don’t like, the person who has what you don’t have, the authoritarian person of wealth and power. We often too easily trash the objectives of people and groups we have something against as our hidden jealousy conceals our own drive to power - forgetting that we are discarding sometimes the vital fragments of reality - the truth we don’t like or the truth we don’t want to be the truth because the different narrative is more appealing to us. It is more enticing to consider that all of Andrew's wealth is a product of Helen’s wit, not his own, isn’t it? But as always, objective truth itself glides through our fingers.In the end, we all like narratives that serve us psychological purposes even if that is one of those altruistic ones, being on the side of the disadvantaged and somewhat, oppressed. In this kaleidoscopic exploration of narratives, Diaz prompts readers to ponder the acceptance of fiction and the ease with which certain narratives supersede others.The plurality of perspectives emerges as a vital force, unveiling the intricate complexity of truth and challenging our propensity to discard narratives that diverge from our preconceived notions.However, despite the brilliance of Diaz's conceptual framework, a lingering sense of unrealized potential permeates the novel for me. The author, like a literary chameleon, mimics diverse writing voices, replicating styles with varying degrees of success. The novel, no matter the interesting metaphysical ideas, at times feels like a literary exercise, a mosaic of styles awaiting the unearthing of Diaz's distinct narrative voice. He has yet to find his own reality and his own voice. But considering the Pulitzer prize is already on his shelf at this stage of his writing, he does not need to sweat.""Trust"" stands as a testament to his literary prowess, an interesting exploration of narratives that transcend temporal boundaries, inviting readers into a realm where reality dances with the elusive delusions of powerful and rich, and disenfranchised."

La biografia di Andrew Bevel scritta da Harold Vanner.Se non che il soggetto raccontato considera inattendibile quel racconto, non degno di fiducia (= trust):Da non credere. Gli eventi immaginari in quell’opera di finzione ora, nel mondo reale, hanno una presenza più forte dei fatti autentici della mia vita.Il romanzo è ambientato principalmente negli anni Venti e Trenta del Novecento.E allora si mette a scrivere in prima persona. Solo che essendo di professione uomo d’affari – un grande affarista – non completa l’opera, scrive dei brani e li collega con una serie di appunti, un catalogo-indice di quello che andrebbe scritto. Ma lui non scriverà.Così ingaggia Ida Partenza per scrivere la versione A: A come autobiografia. Ida Partenza fungerà da segretaria dattilografa stenografa e ghost writer:Ecco come procederemo. Io le racconterò la mia storia, così come mi verrà. Lei la trascriverà e, se necessario, rielaborerà le frasi per far sì che il tutto abbia un senso. Eliminerà le ridondanze e le contraddizioni. Metterà in ordine gli eventi (sa bene come si tenda a saltare avanti e indietro nella conversazione). Si assicurerà che niente suoni troppo stridente o oscuro al lettore medio. Forse ogni tanto aggiungerà un’infiorettatura. Sa, tutte quelle piccole modifiche. Solo perché si legga bene. Io le fornirò la storia, naturalmente, ma lascerò a lei tutti i dettagli e la limatura.Se non che, Diaz in vece che proporci la versione A, ci racconta tutto quello che le sta intorno: come Ida conosce il ricchissimo finanziere Andrew Bevel, come supera la selezione per il posto di segretaria, le sessioni di lavoro, la sua vita privata a Brooklyn, le sue ricerche. E ci regala pagine molto belle - quello che ho trovato un ritratto davvero emozionante – dedicate al padre, tipografo di fede anarchica, che negli Stati Uniti arriva fuggendo dall’Italia, più che emigrare.Qui e là, in corsivo, Ida, quasi mezzo secolo dopo – e nel frattempo passata da ghost writer ad affermata scrittrice - racconta come è finalmente riuscita a leggere ed esaminare le carte private e personali lasciate da Mildred, la moglie di Bevel, conservate in quella che fu la loro casa, ora diventata un museo.Il libro si conclude – e non potrebbe essere altrimenti – con estratti dai diari di Mildred, che riscrivono la storia, peraltro rimasta inedita. Memorie nel ricordo.Gradevolissimo gioco metanarrativo che ruota intorno al concetto di trust/fiducia, che però è anche trust/fondo fiduciario.

Stocks, shares and all that garbage are just claims to a future value. So if money is fiction, finance capital is the fiction of a fiction. That's what all those criminals trade in: fictions... Money is at the core of it all. An illusion we've all agreed to support. Unanimously.

This is such a smart book, and smart in all kinds of ways. The central trope draws parallels between capitalism, especially financial instruments, and fiction - and those images and ideas proliferate throughout the book. Along the way we have a central story that gets undermined, inverted and investigated through connected texts; we have assertions about the representation of gender in writing and the worn-out conventions that imprison women within certain comfortable roles; and we get a host of literary references and allusions from Henry James and Edith Wharton, to Woolf and Barrett Browning, to Plath ('a bell in a bell jar won't ring') and even Rebecca Solnit's Men Explain Things to Me. Diaz is especially concerned with American-based capitalism with the Wall Street setting and the accusation of wealth built upon slavery but the points transfer all too easily beyond the US. It's worth noting, too, the skill with which he captures the tones of the various texts that comprise the book: the nineteenth-century pastiche of the inset novel, the fragmented autobiography of a man determined to impose his own view on reality, the voice of a young female Italian-American from a lower class and anarchist family; the diary that finally gives a voice to the contested wife at the heart of the story who holds a secret - albeit, a ventriloquized voice, as they all are, written by a man. For all the dizzying layers, this is a fast read with a page-turner appeal that lies alongside its more pressing ideas. Huge fun while also being serious in a core politicised way.Many thanks to Picador for an ARC via NetGalley"

15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23385697-glenn-russell,No Rating,"Andy Krieger became a famous foreign exchange trader on the heels of the 1987 crash known as Black Monday. From his office in New York, Andy maneuvered a trade relating to the value of the New Zealand dollar (Kiwi) where he made $300 million dollars. When was the last time you made $300 million dollars in one day? If you did, chances are you are a foreign exchange (Forex) trader. You can look up the richest current day Forex traders. Leading the pack is George Soros with a new worth of $8.6 billion. For the average working stiff grinding it out in an office or behind a counter, in a factory or on a construction site, such astronomical sums of money exist in a different universe. Hernan Diaz's absorbing novel examines the world of kingpin financiers back in the 1920s and 1930s. Ah, the power and magic of money.Trust contains a four part structure: a novel, an autobiography, a memoir and a diary. Since readers are best discovering the twists and surprises while turning the pages, I'll avoid dropping any spoilers by zeroing in on several choice specifics: BONDS, A NOVEL Hernan Diaz acknowledges Henry James as a prime influence. Bonds, Diaz's fictional novel within his novel, is authored by one Harold Vanner. It might be a stretch but I couldn't help thinking of another author with a similar name: Hugh Vereker, the novelist in James' Figure in the Carpet, where sage Vereker divulges his big secret to a young literary critic: his central authorial purpose undergirds all of his writing, like a complex figure in a Persian carpet. I kept wondering if, by having Bonds as his first part, Hernan Diaz was, in turn, indirectly pointing to his authorial purpose in writing Trust. Hint: Think in terms of fiction influencing history along with history influencing fiction.“Because he had enjoyed almost every advantage since birth” - Harold Vanner's novel about Benjamin Rask opens with these words. We come to learn how Rask used advantages of inherited wealth and his special gifts for mathematics and finance to become on of the wealthiest individuals in the world. Indeed, applying discipline and creativity, Rask can been seen as a variation on Hermann Hesse's Magister Ludi - but instead of the Glass Bead Game, Rask's sophisticated game revolves around reading stock market ticker tape. And he doesn't even have to travel to Wall Street; rather, Rask can maneuver stock transactions from the privacy of his townhouse on West 17th Street. The plot thickens when Rask marries Helen Brevoort, a young lady who possesses special gifts of her own. However, Helen also has serious health problems. The bulk of Vanner's later chapters provides the gruesome, grisly details. Thus we have the tale of Benjamin Rask, financial genius, husband, philanthropist, cornerstone of a great, booming American economy. But, but, but...reading between the lines, we can detect what the novel does not address: things like the institution of slavery, the decimation of Native Americans, the brutalization and exploitation of waves of immigrant populations, the pollution and destruction of huge swaths of land and water. Perhaps this unspoken dimension speaks to Hernan Diaz asking readers to question the framework and underlying assumptions of all historical accounts whatever their form: novels, biography, historical treatises, history textbooks.MY LIFE In the second section of Trust, we read about the life of a real financier – Andrew Bevel (real, that is, in the context of Hernan Diaz's novel). There is a particular reason Bevel wants to recap his odyssey as one of the leading men of his age, a reason relating to Harold Vanner's novel. Again, so as to avoid spoilers, I'll focus on a few specific passages, as per - “During this time I saw not only the destiny of our great nation fulfilled but also of my own.”Much of Bevel's autobiography amounts to a paean to American capitalism. Bevel goes to great lengths to proclaim an individual's success and the good of the country are one and the same. Sounds like someone is living in the bubble of his own mythology. To note one of the many, many instances where individual profit and the common good are contrary: the Sackler family and the pharmaceutical industry made a fortune by getting millions of Americans hooked on OxyContin.“Woman represented only 1.5 per cent of the dilettantish speculators at the beginning of the decade (1920s). At the end they neared 40 per cent. Could there have been a clearer indicator of the disaster to come?”Bevel's misogyny is almost laughable. When in doubt, place the blame on women. Bevel is writing this in the early 1940s, where the world of serious business has always been the exclusive domain of men. Of course, white men.“I have a scientific approach to business. Every investment requires profound knowledge of a myriad of specific details.” Sure, Bevel, you're very scientific but, as we find out in later sections of the novel, Bevel is also a narrow-minded, self-serving scumbag and, even worse, a criminal. Guy should have been put behind bars. “All of us aspire to great wealth.”Do we all, Bevel? The ultimate in arrogance: assuming everyone on the planet values what he values, Bevel carries on as if the financier combined with the Protestant work ethic is the final stage of human evolution. Pathetic.A MEMOIR, REMEMBEREDThe two preceding sections are interesting but with this third section where writer Ida Partenza reflects back on the dramatic turning point in her younger life, Trust picks up steam and becomes a page-turner.""Fiction harmless? Look at religion. Fiction harmless? Look at the oppressed masses content with their lot because they have embraced the lies imposed on them. History itself is just a fiction - a fiction with an army. And reality? Reality is a fiction with an unlimited budget. That's what it is. And how is reality funded? With yet another fiction: money. Money is at the core of it all. An illusion we've all agreed to support. Unanimously.""So speaks Ida to her father in their rundown Brooklyn apartment. One could read Trust as an amplification of Ida's words here. So much so I'll conclude with a recommendation: Pick up this Hernan Diaz novel and read with an eye to the final two sections. We shouldn't be surprised it takes a pair of very perceptive, sensitive, intelligent women to sort things out.Hernan Diaz, born 1970"

17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,Rating 4 out of 5,"I love narratives about narratives, stories within stories, and TRUST is an excellent example of the genre that is also one of the most straightforward. I know some readers dislike a feeling of manipulation or bait and switch when they find one narrative to contradict the other, but while those things happen in this book, the book also isn't interested in pulling the rug. It is quite clear about what each section is, and it illuminates as you go.I do want to provide one important note: it was a good thing I saw the accolades for this before I started because at first I wasn't sure what the big deal was and it's very possible I would have put it down. The first part does feel rather like Wharton, a story of a prestigious and tragic wealthy family in New York. The second part had me once again going back to confirm that everyone loved this book, because I was immediately wrinkling my nose at the tedious, self-involved memoir of a man in finance, who bore a strong resemblance to the man in the first story. But I powered through and I wanted to let you know that you will be rewarded for doing so. The second part is supposed to be that grating and it will be worth getting through it. I admit that I do not read many books by cis men these days (my excuse is hilariously the same excuse of the many cis men who read almost entirely cis men--that I let my interests guide my reading) and when I do I have noticed more books with female protagonists as they begin to reckon with patriarchy, though sometimes it is just acknowledging rather than reckoning. This frustrates me more than it pleases me. Plenty of women write about women like this, it is unclear what these men are contributing or what they're trying to say. I would much rather see men grapple with their role in patriarchy directly, but I rarely do. And then this book came along. It is a book about capitalism, the financial system, and wealth, but it is also a story about how men become the heroes of these stories. This book is very smart in how it engages with patriarchy and misogyny, showing us not just the wealthy exploiting the work and care of women. It also uses the voices of men and, ultimately, women as well. The echo of a man telling a woman's story put up against the work women do to tell men's stories bounce back and forth off each other like two mirrors held parallel. I was so satisfied by the end, this is exactly the kind of interesting writing that I have been wanting but mostly not getting from men writing literary fiction. Not a puzzle box, really (after all, the table of contents tells you the four parts and their authors) but still giving you the pleasures of new context making the story deeper and richer as you go.There were some elements of the final section that were too clear for my liking, I would have liked them weaved in in a way that fit the rest of the prose and style. Felt a bit clunky for how expertly done the rest is. But that is also me being a devoted reader of puzzle box stories looking for subtlety and surprise. By the final section you already suspect what you will read, so it is not really a surprise after all."

I sometimes wonder, whatever possessed the committee to pick them. A lot of times, the book is long (like this one), and/or over written and drawn out or not very well thought through. Or written in a way that doesn’t appeal to the average reader. And typically, the Pulitzer Prize is given for its contribution to culture and humanity – not necessarily literary merits. So, when this book, this winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 2023, was provided as a donation to my Little Free Library Shed, I was a bit skeptical about whether or not I would enjoy it. Thus, when I opened the book to begin my reading of it, I found myself pleasantly surprised when I had to force myself to put it down, so I could get some sleep that first night.What happened?This book’s author’s writing happened. It is an unusually-told story about interesting people. And it is a book spun from 4 narratives – a novel wrought from the tale of one man, his attempt to write his own story, his secretary’s memoir and a journal left by his deceased wife. It is also a story, very much about wealth, family, and power set in 1930s New York. And there is something to be said about a story about money. The value we place on it. That money can buy what we need and maybe what we want and eventually what we may dream about. But, at the same time, it makes us question, what really is money?The author shared…“The book is to an enormous extent about this man who's trying to control a narrative. And this is something that I found about wealth in general and wealth in America in particular. Great fortunes have the ability to distort and warp the reality around themselves. Furthermore, they have the power to align, to bend reality according to their own designs. I think, in fact, the greatest luxury good today out there is not, you know, mansions or yachts. It is reality itself.”And the telling of this story, was done in such a way, that intrigued me as a reader. With…Lyrical prose. Complex but fascinating characters. Expert plotting. But mostly, it was exquisite in its storytelling. So, to say the least, I was happy to find that this Pulitzer Prize book was a worthy reading experience. For me. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Interestingly enough, like most Pulitzer Prize winning books, there are mixed reviews. I am not surprised. 4.5 stars rounded up."

So I was mildly relieved that this did not bog down TOO often or heavily into financial minutiae that would prove to be inscrutable - and from what I could glean from other's expert opinions, Diaz gets his bona fides on that score wrong more often than right anyway. But what I wasn't expecting is that the book would prove to be so ... dull anyway. Honestly, I have no idea what the author wanted to say with this - over 400 pages that pretty much boils down to 'Behind every successful (and/or unscrupulous) man lies a woman'. Yawn. The 'Rashomon' structure is neither executed well, nor particularly revelatory of any major surprises - it goes pretty much where you expect it to - and necessitated that long sections of the book were written in substandard prose to carry out the conceit. I cared not a whit for ANY of the characters, and the subsidiary ones who disappeared all too soon were far more interesting than any of the major players. I'd have loved to hear more of 'tieless man in suit'. I can't say I'm disappointed as I didn't have many expectations for this, but so far the Booker judges have been extraordinarily derelict this year."

Now longlisted for Booker Prize 2022This wants to be the Citizen Kane of books and it was pretty close to achieving it. Thematically, it was a success in seeding the doubt in that old story about how a gifted man got to build his empire. Unfortunately, its structure ( 4 parts written in different genres) remains more of a marketing tool to promote its ambitions. I think the start ( the novel ""Bonds"") remains the strongest part. Hernan Diaz writes about the upper class like a modern Henry James, but his narrative is more alert and brutal. The subsequent parts want to answer how much of that fiction was real and look at the schemes that people with power have to build and impose their versions of events.By the time we get to find out the truth, I don't think that it matters as strongly as Hernan Diaz thinks. The power of fiction is stronger than the truth here. In Hernan Diaz words :""Reality is a fiction with an unlimited budget."" Maybe Trust was too ambitious, maybe it does exactly what is supposed to do. The hype is real. For now, for me, Trust is the best book published this year."

27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6700518-lorna,Rating 5 out of 5,"Trust was the latest historical fiction novel by Hernan Diaz following his debut novel, In the Distance, a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2017. Trust was longlisted for The Booker Prize 2022. In this book, Hernan Diaz focuses on wealthy New Yorkers in much the same way as done by Edith Wharton and F. Scott Fitzgerald. An interesting aspect, the reasons becoming clearer as the book progresses, is that the book contains four distinct sections, the first being a novel written by fictitious author Harold Vanner and entitled Bonds. This novella within the book narrates the story of wealth in New York at the time of the Great Depression. As one becomes immersed in the lives of Benjamin and Helen Rask, a wealthy bonds trader and tycoon on Wall Street and his beautiful wife very involved with her philanthropic endeavors in the arts and music and the library. But a scandal arises as Benjamin Rask is accused of manipulating the market in such a way that the Rasks emerged from the crash of 1929 largely unscathed. And questions abound, how did he know? what kinds of manipulations were employed? was there a formula? did he cause the stock market to crash by selling short?But we are just beginning as we embrace the second part of Trust, a memoir by Andrew Bevel, the man depicted in the fictional Bonds as Benjamin Rask. This memoir, much of it just notes as to thoughts and ideas gives us another glimpse into the notorious bonds trader Andrew Bevel and his beautiful wife, Mildred. Bevel is determined to set the record straight after the libelous book Bonds was published. As much more information is fed into the mix, one begins to question previous beliefs as we formulate new questions and new areas of inquiry. And the plot thickens.But at the heart of this novel, is the third part, a memoir by Ida Partenza, the immigrant daughter of an Italian anarchist, a printer and typesetter, putting his skills to good use in America. She tells the story as a woman in her seventies of her life and eventual employment as a young woman as private secretary to Andrew Bevel. This narrative is riveting as we see the view from the top floors in Manhattan through her eyes. But the final section is the narrative by Mildred Bevel, Futures, and that puts this chaos all in order.

The idea of not getting the 'full story' or context, especially in the light of history and certain roles that are or are not given credit, is one of the major themes of the novel.I'm wary to say too much about the plot of this book in fear of 'spoiling' the reading experience. Essentially the story moves from fiction to memoir to journals of various 'characters' as we begin to uncover 'truth' and how its relayed by various writers of history, from novelists to titans of industries.If that's confusing, stick with it. It's actually quite a readable, accessible novel. Diaz's writing is clear and concise. I found myself consistently interested in each section as it shifted perspective and tone. He writes well enough to differentiate the four sections of this novel, through genre and narrative voices that are distinct from one another.However, I felt the end of the novel left me underwhelmed. I felt like this is a book about the journey, not the destination, and once you've taken that journey once, there doesn't seem to be a lot left to meditate on. It also thematically felt familiar. The idea that there are often truths kept in the dark, especially to benefit men throughout history, doesn't seem quite surprising in 2022. "

Il paradosso è che la fiducia è indispensabile anche in narrazioni palesemente inaffidabili. Eppure questa è la Letteratura, credere alle bugie delle persone, entrare nel loro mondo, affidarti al loro Canto. Quello che ottieni dalle loro scuse traballanti, dai loro autoinganni, dalle loro giustificazioni e dalla loro autocommiserazione è la capacità di comprenderli, di avvicinarti e di allenare i sentimenti. Come un muscolo, anche l’empatia si esercita. Trust è un brillante esempio di metaletteratura, che tra le molte cose, parla proprio delle finzioni che la nostra mente escogita per allineare la Realtà ai nostri sbagli, e farli sembrare meno degli errori e più delle decisioni sagge. Le prime cento pagine ci trasportano in una storia dorata di ricchezza e potere, la storia della fortuna di un magnate americano, il discendente di una famiglia di industriali prima e finanzieri dopo, che sposerà una donna talentuosa e solitaria, misteriosamente morta da giovane a causa di una malattia i cui dettagli non saranno mai rivelati, in nome del riserbo familiare. Questo mistery, accompagnato da una prosa sontuosa – molto classica, editwhartiana, che indugia sui dettagli più splendenti del denaro – cede ben presto il passo a un altro tipo narrazione che spiazza il lettore, sopreso da un cambio di tono del tutto inaspettato. La particolarità del libro è proprio la sua struttura che si organizza su quattro punti di vista diversi con quattro stili e registri diversi: prima un romanzo, poi un’autobiografia incompiuta, un’inchiesta e infine un diario. Una scatola cinese in cui il livello narrativo successivo contesta il contenuto del livello precedente, mettendone in dubbio non solo le affermazioni ma anche deridendone il tono. In altre parole, il Mito americano con le sue ancelle (Talento e Merito, Fortuna, Rispettabilità, Intraprendenza) viene rovesciato non soltanto da un punto di vista morale ma persino stilistico. I narratori di miti universali sono inaffidabili, ciascuna versione della storia è enigmatica e l’unica fiducia accordata è nel fatto che nessuno possiede una presa solida sulla realtà. Un romanzo sublime e ingegnoso, su modello di Trilogia di New York di Paul Auster. "

So maybe I'm just grumpy and my 3 stars for this novel would have been 4 had I not had to read it on my Kindle but instead immediately absorbed it into my brain.I probably wouldn't have been interested in reading this novel about a Wall Street Tycoon, despite it having won a Pulitizer, if not for Emily St John Mandel's phenomenal novel The Glass HotelEconomics in fiction just doesn't grab me, nor do insanely rich people. However, I absolutely loved The Glass Hotel which revolved around high end people and a Ponzi scheme. So, Trust. I would not have been interested in some crazy-rich couple from the 1920s -- too Great Gatsby-ish for me - if it hadn't been for that other novel.It's written in four parts by four different characters. I was enthralled with the first two sections and thought this would be a 5 star novel for me. I really enjoy the way Hernan Diaz writes and the stock trading talk was actually interesting.Unfortunately, the magic wore off by Part 3, which was the longest section. I probably would have liked it more had it not been alternately written in the ""present"" and the ""past"". Making matters worse is that the past was written in frickin' italics. Yeh, I know. I bitch about this a lot. But do authors, or perhaps it's the decision of publishers, not care about their readers? My middle aged eyes can't handle more than a sentence in italics. This used to be a basic rule in writing, not to overly use them, because italics are hard on the eyes. Perhaps they assume everyone is listening to audio these days and so it doesn't matter? I don't know but it drives me insane when I have to skip entire chapters. Note to authors and/or publishers:Your readers are not stupid. We can figure out when something is happening in a different timeline. You can always just put the year at the beginning of chapters if you're uncertain of our ability to deduce these things.This is probably a book that's more enjoyable to listen to than read, if you're into audio.I wish I could give it more than three stars, but I didn't enjoy Parts 3 and 4. Aside from the chapters in italics, each section is basically the same story told from different POVs. It got tedious. Oh wow! I just realized I've ""thought"" this review onto Goodreads!

I say it because it's the thought that crossed my mind while reading, and actually earlier than the half way point. Diaz takes a chance when breaking his novel into four sections, and deliberately beginning with a first part that reads like a dry, aging semi-biography. All with reasoning understood later. It's about a Gatsby-esque man who soared to magnificent heights by bending Wall Street to his will. As a young man, he has no interests or direction until he stumbles into investing, and then to a marriage that seems almost due to convenience. There is no dialogue to be had in this part, but there is interest mainly because of the wife, and a closing as tense as it is inexplicable.I'll say this for the second, third and fourth parts: They are like stepping stones. If they are not exactly a straight path, they are ever-broadening with their meaning. With the third, dialogue is finally introduced that most readers, including me, would say is necessary for a novel to be interesting. I'll add that this is where I was finally hooked.Is it worthy of the Pulitzer it won, or co-won? I don't have a good handle on the Pulitzer. The book is a segment of American life, and is an eye-opener to our built-in prejudices. I've yet to read Demon Copperhead, but maybe I'll compare the two after I do."

40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93114967-barbara-k,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this book!!! When it was first published it grabbed my attention because of the cover art (that’s never happened to you?) which got me to read the publisher’s summary. That drew me in further because, having spent most of my life working in support roles in the finance industry, I was curious about Diaz’ message. Now that the book has won a (shared) Pulitzer, I figured the time had come to move it to the top of the list.And now I ask myself, Why did I wait a year? IMO, it’s nothing short of brilliant. The book is comprised of four distinct segments, each of which is focused on the same topic, but from a different perspective. The first piece is a novella, Bonds, the fictionalized story of a blue-blood financier who multiplied his inherited wealth many times over during the 1920’s, pulling out of the markets just prior to the October 1929 crash. The story of his wife, a genius in her own way, receives equal attention. Diaz’ tone for this section is reminiscent of Henry James, cooly and acutely descriptive of this monied world and the people in it, while certain events call to mind Scott Fitzgerald.The next section is an incomplete autobiography written by a financier. Different name and details of his life, but we quickly come to understand that this is a rebuttal to the less flattering aspects of Bonds. This story is told in the petulant voice of a man, who, contrary to the obvious, insists that he is self-made and that, despite his short selling, is guiltless when it comes to the crash. The fault lies with all those working class stiffs who bought on margin (including, god forbid, women!) and, of course, the government.After finishing the book I read some reviews, and in them the third section seems to get short shrift. The narrator of this part is a woman, now an author, who in her youth was hired by the financier as a secretary. In reality she was expected to ghost write his autobiography in the most flattering way possible. For me, her insertion into the financier’s world was a key element of the book overall, given her working class background, with an anarchist immigrant father. Some reviewers describe her as naive, but I can’t accept that description. She easily sees through the financier despite the culture clash, although his now deceased wife remains more of an enigma. She works for him in part because of his compelling aura, but also because she needs the money.Revealing too much of the final section would get into spoiler territory; suffice it to say that it presents yet another view, possibly the most accurate, of the financier’s, and his wife’s, life and times. It could be that part of my enthusiasm for this book is because I feel connected to it personally, on several levels. But I think I’d admire it regardless, for the brilliant writing and the clever structure. Much has been made of the fact that the underlying message is that truth is evasive and subjective. Well yeah, that’s a given. And there are plenty of authors, whether in lit fic or in genre literature, that demonstrate that. But the quality of their writing doesn’t reach this level. I guess I need to go back and read In the Distance, Diaz’ earlier book that was a Pulitzer finalist."
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1903072-peter-boyle,Rating 4 out of 5,"This clever, challenging story is told in four different ways. It begins with Bonds, a novel by Harold Vanner, which describes the life of Benjamin Rask, a reclusive man who makes his fortune on Wall Street in the 1920s. Rask marries an intelligent girl named Helen whose mental health eventually begins to unravel, ending up in a Swiss institute in her attempts to get better. The next section consists of an unfinished memoir by a financier named Andrew Bevel, whose life shares many parallels with the aforementioned Rask. The third part of Trust is what ties the whole novel together. It's told by Ida Partenza, a journalist who is hired by Bevel. Greatly irritated by Vanner's book, which he believes is a fictionalization and exaggeration of his own life, he charges Ida with writing the real story of his fortune, and marriage to Mildred, in order to set the record straight. The final section of Trust is Mildred's diary from her time in hospital, found by Ida many years later, which contains some shocking secrets.I was a big fan of Hernan Diaz's first novel so I was always going to read his next work. With Trust he demonstrates his versatility and the breadth of his imagination - it's a completely different kind of story to his debut, both in terms of subject matter and the way in which it is told. The latter is what really wowed me - each part of the novel has its own unique, authentic voice. Bevel's attempt at a memoir is so drab and unimaginative, echoing his cold, robotic personality. Mildred's journal is fragmented and jumbled, but there are flashes of her sharp intelligence. Vanner's tale of two idiosyncratic people who realise they are perfect for one another really drew me in. I must admit there were parts of Ida's recollection I didn't find that interesting, particularly regarding her father's politics and boyfriend trouble, but her working relationship with Bevel was quite fascinating. All in all, I was hugely impressed by this intricate, innovative story which explores the ways in which different versions of the truth can be expressed, and how it's only by examining all of them together that we can establish the full picture."

I admire Trust but I don't love it. Interesting for me, I realised this after reading Garner's Treacle Walker, a book I love because it does strive to gesture at that breathing, luminous, elusive quality I look for in literature. Trust is all gleaming, glittering surfaces and reflections almost ironically resisting the idea of that aesthetic more. Sure it gestures at it in one of the central character's preoccupation with music culture, but interestingly and on reflection, Trust doesn't reach for that quality itself with its writing. Downgrading to a 3.-----------------------Diaz's Trust is structured as 4 interconnected and nested narratives that provide different accounts of the life of a New York tycoon, his wife and their antecedents as he / they work and manipulate the 1920s markets to build their fortune through to the great crash. This gives us a novel within a novel structure. The first, ""Bonds"", attributed to Harold Vanner is ostensibly a novelisitic account of the characters Benjamin Rath (wealthy financier / Wallstreet tycoon) and his wife (Helen Rath, nee Breevort). The book centres on both Benjamin's and Helen's separate lives before they marry, their rather eccentric marriage, Benjamin's business practices and acumen, and finally Helen's descent into mental illness and treatment at a sanitorium / health spa in the Swiss Alps. The prose and structure is a knowing, glinting pastiche of Wharton's and Scott-Fitzgerald's works, especially Gatsby (there are references to Great Gatsby throughout the novel). The Second, ""My Life"" , is a memoir by financier Andrew Bevel. The aggrieved Bevel is seeking to set the record straight (or if necessary bend reality to his version of events) as he believes his name and role in USA history and markets has been besmirched by the fictionalised account of his life (Bonds written by Vanner we discover is based on the lives of Andrew and his wife Mildred). He apparently is also endeavouring to reclaim the memory of his wife Mildred (Helen in Bonds), who did not suffer from mental illness; we learn as Trust progresses through the four works that she died from cancer. The third, ""A Memoir, Remembered"" by Ida Partenza, is where Trust really came into its own for me. Up to this section, I was intrigued and fascinated by the whole Gatsbyesque thing. I could see hints coming through of meta concerns about the nature of artifice, art, truth and deception. I was also being made complicit and involved in these conceits as I endeavoured to work out my interpretation of the relationship between the two sections and follow the thread of references and allusions Diaz peppers throughout. It's my participation in constructing this shared artifice and the readerly trust in 'Diaz' that fascinated and still intrigues me. Was it the kind of novel I thought it was? Was Diaz deceiving me with these various allusions and pastiches? What's the relationship between art and finance that he wants me to play with and explore here. And already for me the question at the heart of the narrative was who is Helen / Mildred. Her dislocating, unsettling figure and presence was the most interesting aspect of Trust. In this third section, we get the persepective of Ida Partenza, an Italian Immigrant, living with her father in Brooklyn. Ida applies for a secretarial role with Andrew Bevel but the role turns out to be a ghostwriter for the memoir we've just read in section 2. As she works with Andrew on the memoir draft she seeks to unravel the various layers of intrigue and deception seeking to get at the mystery of who Mildred was and her role in Andrew's life and independently with her strong interest in and support for the arts, especially music (but it turns out far more than just in the sense of distanced dilettante benefactor of the arts). The narrative and writing through the Partenza section becomes layered with so many deceptions that deepen the themes of artifice in both art, finance, interpersonal relationships (marriages, author-reader, father-daughter). Diaz here is exploring ideas of the complexity and necessity of deception; the lies and 'understandings' we share to keep things working, including markets, loves and perhaps even more significantly how our self-understanding also requires those deceptions that are at the very core of our identities. I found Partenza to be an incredibly interesting character and narrative device through which Diaz anchors and connects the four sections.The final section is shorter than the previous four and is as far as we can tell the journal account of Mildred Bevel, written during her final days in palative care at the Swiss hospice / spa. This section is also very well done and deepens the intrigue. Passages here are moving and beautifully written. There are revelations here that ask you to rethink much of what's come before. It asks you to consider who has been deceiving whom, the trust required to make deception work. It brings to the fore important considerations about gender that have been central though in the earlier sections. The reveals aren't especially surprising and are mostly prefigured by the time you get very far into section three. But it's the artifice of the reveals that perhaps keeps you guessing and questioning even after the final page is turned. What's the providence and artifice of the journal itself? Why assume it has any more authenticity than the previous accounts? Are we still being played with and deceived? And even if we are, do we care, after all isn't that part of the trust that makes literature hum with authenticity: we overlook the contrivances and deceptions, or perhaps even more interesting, we admire them and trust them as they do their work on us. Is the Mildred we get here the 'real Mildred' or the Mildred Partenza prefers and wants to assert? I guess Diaz is posing, what do you reader, want to make of Mildred?Some readers may also find it all to be all smoke and mirrors kitsch and pastiche of Gatsby type novels and concerns. Diaz though more than winks back at this right from the pages of Mildred's journal (as discovered, stolen and perhaps even rewritten by Ida Partenza):""Kitsch. Can't think of Engl. trans. for this word. A copy that's so proud of how close it comes to the original that it believes there's more worth in this closeness than in originality itself.'It looks just like . . . !' Imposture of feeling over actual emotion; sentimentality over sentiment. Kitsch can also be in the eye: 'The sunset looks like a painting!'. Because artifice is now the ultimate standard, the original (sunset) has to b turned into a fake (painting), so that the latter may provide the measure of the former's beauty. Kitsch is always a form of inverted Platonism, prizing imitation over archetype. And in every case, it's related to an inflation of aesthetic value, as seen in the worst kind of kitsch: 'classy' kitsch. Solemn, ornamental, grand. Ostentatiously, arrogantly annonucing its divorced from authenticity'.But does this reflection on artifice, kitsch, deception contribute anything more than a shallow formalism? In some ways this is a question that Diaz preempts and the relationships he explores between worlds of finance and art/music sets up a consideration of such values in quite complex even nuanced ways. But for me on reconsideration I'm not convinced Trust itself conveys that sense of 'something more' including in how its characters are depicted and developed. Trust is a fine and fascinating novel. There's definitely an ostentatious arrogance in its writing as it plays with its meta-structures and themes. Ostentatious not in the sense of overly ornamental but more in its shimmering clean surfaces and lines. For me the distinctive styles and voices for each book mirror that book's themes and contribute to the overall ideas of deception and trust. The very architecture of the novel plays with ideas of deception, artifice and the deep rooted connections between art and finance.There's a lot more going on in Trust than I have covered here.

I just felt this “trust,” or alignment with the author. The author who rose above the four narratives of this book, the four stories by men and women that are the sum of the parts that give us the whole. Fact and fiction overlap, and through these stories, the poignant truths have a way of appearing and resting in repose.It opens with a novel within the novel—a story called BONDS, by Harrold Vanner, written in 1937, in third person, about an early 20th century financier, one of those masters of the universe, Benjamin Rask, and his wife, Helen. Benjamin is wildly successful and Helen was a quiet woman who spent her time with cultural patronage, such as writers and musicians/composers. Andrew Bevel’s incomplete autobiography comes next, in MY LIFE (the second narrative). The third narrative is Ida Partenza’s memoir, and reveals how she is hired by Bevel to write his story. She’s a future published writer, daughter of an anarchist Italian immigrant, hired to help shape and write Bevel’s story.Bevel is widowed now, and wishes to set straight the story of his success, as well as his wife's quiet and “feminine” support and cultural benefaction. The way he expects Ida to capture it is almost mythical. In fact, these captains of industry and finance are practically mythological creatures themselves. After all—how does one man manage to control, move, and manipulate the market for “the common good” of all people? “Short selling is folding back time. The past making itself present in the future.”I won’t give spoilers, so I will circumvent trails that set upon the plot and path. But it was one of the most unusual designs/architecture of a story I have ever read. The underwhelming denouement is only a disappointment for a minute, because Diaz’ writing, themes, and emotional truth is what captivated me all along.The Bonds story evokes an Edith Wharton style and tone, matching the era that Benjamin Rask rose to power, the calm precision of sentences, the ambiguity we associate with artistic prose. As Ida describes, the writing “existed in a vague space between the intellectual and the emotional…Lucidity…is the best hiding space for deeper meaning---much like a transparent thing stacked between others.” Like much in this book, the reader will get the sense that the mysteries are hiding in plain sight. Or, as Andrew tells Ida:“If I’m ever wrong, I must make use of all my means and resources to bend and align reality according to my mistake so that it ceases to be a mistake.”Ida believed that Vanner’s presentation of Helen was largely illusory, and that Andrew Bevel’s version of Mildred was as equally deceptive, perhaps even sinister in its veil. Men taking charge of depicting their wives. Ida often hit Bevel’s nerve by suggesting clarity during his dictation to her. She also supposed that within the pages of both men’s narratives, the truth quivered. She just needed to probe, poke, prod, peer through the embellishments and reductions until the truth manifested itself.Diaz writes with such luster, refinement, and temperate ambiguity (when fitting) that I was riveted to the story. “…I’ve come to think one is truly married only when one is more committed to one’s vows than the person they refer to.” The magic of his writing blew me away, the ongoing paradoxes, his head above at all times, a dignity of prose that’s both natural and poised.“Can you believe it? The imaginary events in that piece of fiction now have a stronger presence in the real world than the actual facts of my life.”This one will surely make my top books of the year."

45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4617856-trudie,Rating 4 out of 5," 4.5  I was hesitant to start this new novel by Hernan Diaz even though I loved his previous book In the Distance. It seems to be the reception to this work is decidedly marmite and I was concerned I was going to be disappointed.No need to fear! This was like Diaz invited Edith ( Wharton ) and Micheal (Lewis) over for tea and they discussed a novel that was about Money and Class, Finance and Myth-making. Edith agreed to pen the book ""Bonds"" and Lewis did a little of his collateralized debt obligation explanation. Virginia ( Woolf ) couldn't make the meeting but sent in some diary entries. I get why that mix might be anathema to some, but it mostly worked for me. I really like this author for his quizzical, critical eye, and his willingness to play with the reader's expectations. But mostly I love him for taking a sledgehammer to 'American mythologies'. As the author himself says  I love working with clichés and precipitated historical narratives, hardened over time. They call for geological exploration.  - and I certainly enjoy what he unearths.Did Diaz entirely make this work? Maybe not ( I need a reread to be convinced ) but nevertheless, this is my pick of the 2022 Booker longlist (so far). Seemingly a controversial position!"

47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75729982-metempsicoso,Rating 5 out of 5,"Dispiegato nella sua interezza, appare come questa costruzione equilibrata e sospesa, un connubio ammirabile di ciò che oramai è classico americano e delle tematiche forti su cui si interrogano le nuove penne della contemporaneità.Muta negli abiti, assume quattro forme diverse, eppure continua a richiamarsi, citandosi, in questo gioco di specchi deformanti che è pura metafiction: un trip dinnanzi a un baratro dove la letteratura è schiacciata da inusuali regole gravitazionali che la rendono ancora più malleabile e travisabile, un invito a gettarcisi dentro per smarrirsi.È così variegato, così ""aperto"", da renderne difficile parlarne. Potessi tornare indietro, non ne leggerei alcuna recensione ed eviterei persino la quarta di copertina e gli strilli: alla sua molteplicità si dovrebbe arrivare disarmati (anche se temo che molte lettrici e molti lettori ne uscirebbero, almeno per la prima metà, con le ossa rotte). Di buono ha che, essendo così composito, disprezzarlo tutto, dall'inizio alla fine, per un'amante della letteratura americana è quasi impossibile.La prima “forma” è un romanzo statunitense dei primi del Novecento. Riecheggia Warthon e scivola in Gatsby. Io che trovo lo stile della prima impossibile da replicare, ho un po' faticato a farmelo stare simpatico. Non mi ha aiutato l'aver letto la trama, svelandomi il suo essere un romanzo biografico molto romanzato di protagonisti, ancora non entrati sul palcoscenico, che sapevo non ne sarebbero stati entusiasti.La discesa nella follia della dolce protagonista, troppo talentuosa e sfortunata, mi ha richiamato alla mente le storie di molte scrittrici sfortunate (prima fra tutte, Sylvia Plath, cui si fa riferimento poi anche in altre piccole citazioni) e, proprio per questo, anche il mio primo imprinting letterario.Funziona meglio sul finale, quando lo scrittore - quello finto, inventato da Diaz - ha modo di concentrarsi su di lei, riempiendosi di una tenerezza nei suoi riguardi che era rimasta assente, nonostante l'ammirazione, con il ricco magnate che spadroneggiava nella prima metà. Eppure, e qui c'è il genio della costruzione letteraria di questo romanzo, le recriminazioni formali devono essere sospese: è Diaz che non è stato in grado di dare il giusto spessore a questa prima porzione, o il suo era un effetto ricercato e voluto, per accentuare la distanza di chi legge con l'uomo calunniato, dando al lettore un'operetta senza grandi guizzi, di modo da rendere ancora più palese l'ostilità del ritratto?C'è poi uno stacco e l'inizio, quasi violento, di un nuovo aspetto: l'autobiografia di quel magnante, scaturita dall'indignazione per quel romanzetto sentimentale dato alle stampe. Ci si accorge dopo, quando le prime pagine ad uno stato più avanzato di elaborazione lasciano spazio ad altre piene di note, che è un'opera incompiuta. È una scelta stilistica potente: dell'arcigno Andrew Bevel non emergono solo le sue posizioni sulla ricchezza e il potere che lui vuole trasmettere, ma in controluce, nella perentorietà delle sue indicazioni, anche la sua detestabile personalità. Strafottente ed egolatra, egli è ben più odioso rispetto al personaggio fittizio a lui ispirato nella prima parte di Trust.Fino a questo punto, personalmente avevo portato avanti la lettura con una certa curiosità solo per l'idea su cui si basava.Poi, ha inizio il memoir di Ida Partenza. Scrittrice avanti con gli anni, con un paio di successi alle spalle, d'improvviso è richiamata all'ordine dalla Letteratura: quella sua prima opera lasciata incompiuta, dopo anni, deve essere conclusa. Lei, la ghostwriter a cui Bevel aveva affidato la propria autobiografia affinché ritraesse con delicato tratto femminile la fragile moglie Mildred, sente il bisogno irrefrenabile di scoprire chi era davvero questa donna che Bevel le aveva più volte dato l'impressione di voler nascondere all'opinione pubblica.E in un'operazione che, nella finzione del romanzo contenitore, ha un approccio estremamente letterario, a la Annie Ernaux, nel comporre il proprio memoir, Ida racconta di come questa sua autobiografia è nata, mentre fruga tra le poche carte rimaste di Mildred, ripercorrendo in contrapposizione anche come ha ottenuto quel suo primo impiego letterario e quella che è stata la sua formazione, il suo ambiente formativo e il rapporto non sempre semplice con il padre, immigrato italiano anarchico. Infine, il romanzo si chiude con una ricreazione letteraria di quelli che io qui, su questo profilo, chiamo diari ""in prossimità della fine"". Le frasi brevi, lampanti, a tratti confuse poiché non sufficientemente elaborate, i continui ""spegnimenti"": lo stile di Diaz muta completamente, con una verosimiglianza spaventosa, in una delle porzioni che io ho apprezzato di più. Di nuovo, è impossibile non pensare a molte intellettuali che si sono ritrovate a raccogliere le proprie memorie in condizioni simili: Sontag, Lorde, Taylor, persino la nostra Pia Pera. Qui, in base a come si decide di leggere questo romanzo nella sua completezza e complessità, molte domande trovano risposta e altre, infinite altre, si aprono, destinate a restare insolute per sempre. Per come questo libro è pensato e strutturato, infatti, è quasi doveroso perdersi in riflessioni infinite. È di certo un romanzo incentrato sul potere, su come pochi, esercitando forze e pressioni su una materia intangibile ed evanescente come sono titoli, quotazioni e indici di Borsa, possano tenere in scacco interi paesi, cambiando l'esistenza di molti con una leggerezza quasi inconcepibile. È un trattato, se vogliamo, sul senso di onnipotenza che il denaro dona, sulla perdizione in cui scaraventa l'ambizione, sul distaccamento dal reale che procura averlo e sulla sua distribuzione casuale e, il più delle volte, ingiusta. Affronta di petto, poi, il tema delle prospettive e delle infinite interpretazioni che un singolo evento può subire in base alla posizione da cui lo si osserva e da chi può prendere parola. Da chi se ne appropria, in particolare, della parola, esercitando la leva di cui sopra. La realtà, come più volte Diaz ricorda, si può costringere dove è necessario, se si hanno i soldi per farlo.Spicca poi per il vigoroso sottotesto femminista. Ida e Mildred sono entrambe costrette dalla società e da figure patriarcali tossiche e soffocanti ad uniformarsi, a stringersi. Eppure, ad entrambe, talento e tenacia permettono di trovare un modo per liberarsi comunque dal giogo. Pur riconoscendo che a tratti ciò è proposto in modo fin troppo didascalico, è piacevole trovare un autore maschio etero cis capace di guardare oltre il proprio naso (e Diaz aveva già manifestato una certa ""sensibilità"" anche ne Il falco).Infine, e poi davvero mi taccio, trovo che Trust risalti per questa sua riflessione sotterranea sul tema del come si racconta l'identità nella letteratura, attingendo a piene mani a idee e riflessioni proprie dell'autofiction che negli ultimi anni hanno cominciato ad emergere in molti memoir e autobiografie letterarie. Non è un caso che qui si raccolgano un romanzo biografico, un'autobiografia dettata ad una ghostwriter con intenti di base propagandistici, un memoir letterario e un diario.Denso di citazioni e rimandi, è pura letteratura, in uno dei suoi aspetti più affilati e contemporanei che mi è capitato di leggere da un po'. Mi chiedo, a margine, se la pandemia - con il suo darci più tempo mentre ci costringeva a realizzare che questo poteva essere molto fugace - ha contributo a portare nuova linfa tra gli scrittori americani. Ritengo sia un solidissimo 4 stelle, considerata la debolezza iniziale. [Apro una parentesi. Tra i difetti, c'è il modo in cui Diaz riporta il contesto storico. È evidente che si è molto documentato a riguardo, ma spesso ciò è messo su carta con pipponi infiniti che sembrano veri e propri saggi/manuali di storia ricopiati all'interno del romanzo. Siccome questo elemento è presente in tutte e tre le prime parti (ironia della sorte, sarebbe stato giustificabile, se lo si rintracciasse solo in quelle di Ida, come difetto della scrittrice ... Aspetto estremamente affascinante, ancora una volta, di questo testo), è palese che questa è una carenza di Diaz autore, che per me ha un po' sospeso l'effetto che le quattro diverse forme e le diverse penne dovevano creare.]Ma siccome rivela, poi, così tanto su cui sarebbe bellissimo perdere ore a riflettere e credo sia destinato ad essere ricordato negli anni e sul finire davvero non volevo posarlo, credo sarà una delle mie pochissime 5 stelle.[Fresco di Pulitzer, Diaz se lo merita proprio]"
48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115890-constantine,Rating 3 out of 5,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐ Genre: Historical FictionLonglisted for the Booker Prize 2022, Trust feels like an ambitious project that didn’t reach its full potential. The book is structured into parts where each part/story has a different tone. It felt more like a story inside a story. Finance and wealth are the main themes in all the stories. I connected with the first part more than the subsequent ones. I think Benjamin Rask was a fascinating character which made that part more intriguing. Somewhere in the second story, I lost focus and was reading without much enthusiasm. I didn’t find the other parts interesting enough to grasp my attention, but I kept pushing to see if something interesting will happen. I feel this is one of those books that will depend on your personal taste in the way the stories are told. To me, my biggest gripe was that I picked up a novel but instead I got short stories. Yes, even if they are related to each other, they still count as multiple stories in my book."
49,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2922102-blaine,Rating 3 out of 5,"Most of us prefer to believe we are the active subjects of our victories but only the passive objects of our defeats. We triumph, but it is not really we who fail—we are ruined by forces beyond our control.…So if money is fiction, finance capital is the fiction of a fiction. That’s what all those criminals trade in: fictions.Trust opens with a novel-within-the novel called Bonds, which tells the story of Benjamin Rask’s his rise to the top of Wall Street before and after the 1929 crash and the story of his marriage to the enigmatic Helen Rask. It’s interesting enough, if a bit overwrought, but its presentation of a titan of industry who’s a shitty husband was hardly groundbreaking. The book then shifts to an incomplete memoir-within-the-novel called My Life, which tells of Andrew Bevel’s marriage to Mildred Bevel and his rise to the top of Wall Street before and after the 1929 crash—a strangely similar story to the fictional Rask’s. This section is just deliberately annoying, as Andrew paints himself as an Ayn Rand fever dream, single-handedly saving the American economy through his profiteering. Trust’s third section, A Memoir was written by Ida Partenza, Mr. Bevel’s private secretary. This section begins to resolve the origins and differences of the earlier novel and memoir. It was probably my favorite section, the only one with any nuance, and Ida was the only likable character in the whole book. Finally, the book concludes with a diary-within-the-novel, Futures, that was written by Mildred Bevel. It presents a third version of the Bevels’ marriage and Andrew Bevel’s rise to the top of Wall Street before and after the 1929 crash. Perhaps we’re supposed to believe that Mildred’s version is the “true” version of events. But after three other versions, there’s no particular reason to believe it, especially since it’s just as self-serving as Andrew Bevel’s memoir.I suppose there are some larger messages to be drawn from the interlocking tales, but the only ones I could see were painfully obvious and hardly worthy of such a complicated story. We never really know the truth about the lives of the rich, powerful, and/or famous? Rich men exaggerate their successes, minimize their failures, and marginalize the importance of the people who helped them, even and maybe especially their wives? Trust won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, but I have to admit, I was underwhelmed."

I was drawn into each reflection of a character's shadowy past, to only see how it reflected on their contemporary choices. It all deftly illustrates why Diaz's writing is so highly sought after.

Using four textual forms (novella, manuscript outline, memoir, and diary), Diaz explores the lives of three protagonists, all of whom must come to terms with the inherent truth of this lyric.And in doing so, Diaz goes all-in stylistically. The novella is atmospheric, mannered, and self-consciously fictional. The manuscript is dry as a bone and soporific. The terminal diary is precise, personal, and abbreviated. (I suspect that neither of these latter two would be very tolerable on audiobook.). But the memoir, the third and most accessible and interesting section, ties them all together and makes the less stimulating portions worth the effort. It is Diaz’s best work.The novel as a whole deals with several major themes: Money, Power, Gender, Class, Politics. And it does so both directly and obliquely. It becomes clear where the author’s sensibilities lie, but he is able to incorporate various moral messages without first mounting a soapbox. The quiet promotion of feminism, charitable giving, cultural diversity, truth in advertising, public library access, and support for the Arts made the book more enjoyable for me.As things progress, descriptions of the stock market madness of The Roaring Twenties evoke today’s global trading frenzy, itself facilitated by easy access to risky assets by an often gullible public. Margin calls, hedges on inflation, manipulation of share price (hello, Gamestop!) - even short-selling one’s own major holdings - are all featured here. Ditto gender “politics” and the imbalance that persists. By including Ida’s immigrant, anarchist father and ambitious, untalented boyfriend in her story, Diaz casually reveals that she is viewed as less-than by all men, not just those who are wealthy, American-born, and personally unrelated.And the layers continue. Ostensibly the tale of a pedigreed titan of finance and his struggle to protect a mythic image in perpetuity, this is really all about where true greatness lies, whether or not it is recognized and appreciated by the world at large. I found it intellectually compelling, well-researched, entertaining, and thought-provoking. There are friends whose opinions I respect who did not have similar experiences. For me, though, this proved to be an excellent return on investment.4.5 stars*Lin-Manuel Miranda"
54,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32318315-hugh,Rating 4 out of 5,"Longlisted for the Booker Prize 2022Another book from this year's impressive Booker longlist, this one was something of a slow burner. It effectively tells elements of the same story from four conflicting perspectives, and at its centre is a trader, Andrew Bevel, who made money by predicting and helping to trigger the 1929 crash, and his wife Mildred, whose diaries form the final section, which reveals that both Bevel's spectacular success and his role in the crash were mostly down to her mathematical genius. . The first and dullest part is a novel, in which the Bevels are fictionalised. After Mildred's early death, Bevel buys up all remaining copies of the novel and pulps them, and hires a young woman Ida Partenza to help him write his own account. The third and longest part gives Ida her own voice, and explores her background as the daughter of an Italian anarchist extremist, for whom Bevel personifies everything that is wrong with American society.The whole thing is rather clever, and unusually my assessment of it was improved by the final part, but it is perhaps a little too long."

I did manage to get it on audio as well. The first section is narrated by Edoardo Ballerini and that made it even more of a hit for me. This is a story of NYC and a fictional financier, his life, his wife and the 1920's in NYC finance. It is told in 4 parts, each a different point of view concerning the same group of characters and events. This style of telling a story shows the reader how each teller of the story has their own way of interpreting the events. (It is an intriguing trop of storytelling that I have enjoyed in the past in both The Alexandria Quartet and An Instance of the Fingerpost.)This book drew me immediately in. The first section was so engaging that I did not want to stop listening and kept on far beyond my bedtime. I'm sorry to report it was mostly downhill from there. It was a good story. There were a few twists and turns, but most I saw coming and the ending while enlightening was not what I had hoped. I felt sure from the first section that this would be a new 5 star for me. While it did not quite hit that mark, I did finish it in 4 days and enjoyed most of it. I would recommend it, especially if you love a good historical fiction about 1920's NYC and the workings of money and stocks. The audio is by four different narrators, Edoardo Ballerini, Jonathan Davis, Mazhon Marno, and Orlagh Cassidy. Each voice fit their character well and over all the audio was excellent. I did find having the book helped me in going back and forth in the story to see exactly how the author was piecing and fitting the various view points. Four solid stars."

It is astonishing, amazing, hypnotizing, mesmerizing and much more. It is like watching an object slowly being inserted between two mirrors that are facing each other. It is like watching while the past, moving through the future somehow becomes the present. It is four books in one and at the same time one book in four parts.I'm quite sure everyone who reads it will have a different impression of it, but then, isn't that what makes us all individuals?"
57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72907701-dax,Rating 3 out of 5,"This one seems to be getting rave reviews from the pros, but a bit more mixed from those of us among the amateur ranks. Diaz's first novel was A+, so I was excited to see what his sophomore effort would look like.Thematically, 'Trust' is impressive. Diaz looks into the distinction, or lack thereof, between history and fiction. How narrative can be used as a device to bend fact. Not a new concept by any means, but Diaz tackles it well. Money, the ultimate fiction, as the omnipotent commodity. The last part of the novel touches on the role of women throughout history, and history's tendency to marginalize and overshadow their roles. All of those themes make for interesting study. The problem here lies with Part II, which is framed as an incomplete manuscript of a memoir by the central character. It is superfluous. The far more interesting Part III illustrates the same points that the author is trying to make in Part II. To make matters worse, Diaz intentionally writes with a stiff prose to match Bevel's character traits. He does it too well. Eliminating this section would have improved the reading experience without missing the important takeaways the writer was trying to create. This is a significantly different approach from Diaz's first novel, both stylistically and thematically. It shows a wide talent with immense promise of future work. We should all keep an eye on Diaz, even if this one wasn't quite our cup of tea. I thought it good though and give this a comfortable three stars."

Vordergründig geht es um den Aufstieg des Mannes und um die Krankheit und den Tod seiner Frau. Die Wendungen darf man aus Spoiler-Gründen nicht erzählen. Eigentlich handelt der Roman aber von der Unterscheidung zwischen Wirklichkeit und Fiktion. Es gibt Fiktionen in der Fiktion. Es gibt Lügen in der erzählten ""Wirklichkeit"". Es gibt Nebenhandlungen, in denen es nicht anders aussieht. ""...er war ein feuriger Erzähler, der selten zögerte, die Wahrheit der Dramaturgie zu opfern. Manchmal gab es je nach Publikum unterschiedliche Versionen einer Geschichte."" sagt die Erzählerin des dritten Teils über ihren Vater. Auf ""Treue"" übertragen, könnte man auch sagen: Manchmal gibt es je nach Erzähler unterschiedliche Versionen einer Geschichte.Das Alles klingt kompliziert. Doch der Roman liest sich nicht verkopft.

59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56831772-celia-x1fa90,Rating 5 out of 5,"Tengo que advertiros que esta reseña va a ser un poco diferente a los mamotreto bíblicos que suelo publicar. En primer lugar, va a ser más corta. Y en segundo lugar, voy a decir lo mínimo posible del argumento de esta novela. Porque creo que el encanto de la misma consiste en darle una oportunidad sabiendo lo menos posible, dejar que poco a poco te sorprenda la maestría con la que Hernán Díaz mueve todos los hilos de estáis historia, con una economía de medios tan inteligente como hábil. Respecto a la trama, por introducir un poco en ella más, ddecir que todo gira entorno al matrimonio Rask. El marido, Benjamin, es un magnate que en los felices años 20 americanos logra hacer una inmensa fortuna, usando la coyuntura económica del momento para su propio beneficio. Incluso cuando ésta sea adversa para el resto de los mortales. Por su parte, su esposa Helen es una mujer muy peculiar e inteligente, hija de una familia de excéntricos aristócratas. Los dos conforman una pareja popular y exitosa, pero sus personalidades y su forma de ser están fuertemente marcadas por la soledad y la angustia existencial. Dos aspectos que poco a poco se irán haciendo palpables a medida que los excesos de la época revelar el lado oculto de los Rask. Si es que existieron en la realidad….Y es que nos encontramos ante un ejercicio absolutamente magistral de meta-historia y narrativa. La novela se articula en cuatro partes, cada una de ellas narrada por una persona desde un punto de vista concreto. Cada una de estas partes es diferente a las otras, pero todas se complementan. Hay algo de detectivesco en la forma en que día va relacionando cada uno de forma pausada, como poco a poco va enlazándolas. Las cuatro partes están escritas de una forma diferente, tanto en tono y prosa como en el uso del narrador y la forma en que este habla con su público. Y eso da más realismo a todo lo que estamos leyendo, convirtiendo diferentes visiones y experiencias en un todo que tiene algo caleidoscópico, demostrando hasta que punto un mismo detalle o trama cambian según quien lo cuente y sus intuiciones. Puede que al principio lo parezca, pero “Fortuna” no es una novela fácil. Parte de un tema que puede resultar farragoso y aburrido, el lector tiene que estar muy pendiente de los detalles, de los juegos de palabras y de los dobles sentidos de sus frases para poder seguir la historia, y nunca está seguro de que es exactamente lo que está teniendo entre manos y a donde le va a llevar el autor. Hay fragmentos que son difíciles de leer por lo enrevesados que son, y hubo páginas que tuve que leer las dos veces para captar todo lo que cuenta. Pero aún así es una maravilla como juega el autor con las palabras y las perspectivas. Cómo convierte a sus personajes en piezas, que sean usadas contra su voluntad para sus propios propósitos, demostrando eso de que un novelista puede llegar a ser dios entre las páginas de su trabajo. Además, el que los capítulo sean tan cortos hace que la lectura, dentro de lo que cabe resulte bastante ágil y amena. Porque Díaz nos propone un juego de espejos, en el cual nos muestra nunca sus cartas de una vez, es a medida que se van sucediendo las páginas que va guiando lentamente al lector por un laberinto de ópticas morales, personales y de tiempo y espacio que van despejándose capa a capa.Con un pulso que a veces recuerda a Edith Wharton por la época y las descripciones sociales, otras, a una novela de detectives, otra zona crónica social y otras partes llenas de una personalidad rabiosamente propia y particular; Hernán Díaz nos cuenta una historia increíblemente aséptica en todos los sentidos. La trama es lo más sencilla que puedas concebir, donde los personajes realmente importantes pueden contarse con los dedos de la mano y te sobran; con excepción de algunas escenas en Europa, apenas nos movemos de la Nueva York del siglo XX, siendo la mansión de los Brevel el punto neurálgico del que parte todo y entorno al cual todo pivota. Prácticamente todo el conjunto descansa en los personajes y en su psicología, y en como Díaz los va desplegando ante el lector y logra que los temas anodinos que maneja se convierta en algo relevante y en una trama consistente, por lo bien esbozados que están los retratos de sus protagonistas y la forma en que logra presentarlos con total nitidez ante el lector, mostrándonos los motivos de su forma de ser y actuar y como llegaron a ello, cimentados en sus pasados, situaciones familiares y sociales y su forma de ser . El ritmo es pausado pero no lento, es el justo y apropiado para ir trabajando los vericuetos de la obra de forma minuciosa pero sin caer en la lentitud, logrando mantener el equilibrio entre desarrollar los caracteres e imprimir vidilla a la lectura.El mayor pero que puedo ponerle a la obra es lo pesado y farragoso que en muchos momentos se me ha hecho toda la parte dedicada a las finanzas y la creación del imperio económico entorno al cual gira casi todo, y las diferentes informaciones y maniobras monetarias que se describen a lo largo de la novela. Hubo no pocos momentos en que me perdí y me aburrí un poco leyendo tanto sobre el tema. Pero la verdad es que también creo que esa parte el autor la ha manejado bastante bien en varios momentos. Lo ha hecho bastante fácil para el lector, sobre todo para el que como servidora no tenga ni idea de estas cuestiones. Y a la vez ayuda a que muchas de estas consideraciones nos muestren detalles sobre las personalidades de sus protagonistas y a tu madre a contextualizar mejor sus existencias, por no hablar que uno de los temas centrales de la novela es el capitalismo y el devenir económico de los Estados Unidos de América, la manera en que la sociedad mentalidad de ese país se ha cimentado en la economía y la posesión de los medios financieros y la evolución social de esta nación a lo largo del siglo XX. Eso son los temas de “Fortuna” un fresco sobre el devenir de un país cimentado en unos personajes únicos, víctimas de sus propias circunstancias y de unas personalidades arabescas y acomplejadas y que cobran fuerza con fiereza y cercanía en la forma en que se demuestran cuando les toca hablar y como cada uno son partes esenciales de un vibrante y humano puzzle que no terminara de completarse hasta que se llegue a la última página del libro. Sin lugar, a dudas, de mis mejores lecturas del 2023. Deseando seguir leyendo este autor, que tan para bien me ha sorprendido."

an impressive, often mesmerizing feat of narration and storytelling, hernan diaz's trust (following his pulitzer finalist debut, in the distance) is a tale of wealth, power, veracity, influence, privilege, and legacy. the polyphonic story of a prominent financier, his wife, and the conflicting portrayals of their lives and fortunes, trust offers four distinct perspectives, each with its own version of verisimilitude. diaz's remarkably assured second novel reckons with reality, those who get to write it, those silenced/banished/marginalized to its fringes, and the ways in which affluence distorts, disrupts, and even discards the voices and vantages of those without the clout to amend or alter the official record, let alone tell their own story themselves. hierarchy, individual gain vs. collective good, profit, plunder, and popularity, trust, though set so many decades ago, resounds with relevance in our hyper-connected, ever accelerating age of money worship and proliferating public persona. trust is an exceptional novel, one which functions on so many different levels while never ever forsaking for even an instant the compelling power of prose and the irresistibility of scintillating storytelling. diaz does it all and more; trust is telling the truth."

In many ways I liked the ambition of this novel, but the execution felt oddly lifeless, despite my not being someone who needs high emotional investment in my prose. The same fabulously wealthy financier is at the heart of four sections - the first a purported novel in which his life is fictionalized, the second a draft 'memoir,' the third the personal account of a young woman hired as his ghostwriter, and the fourth a diary maintained by his wife. Interesting to explore the relationship between finance and fiction, lots to think about there. And I mildly enjoyed the first and third parts, which are the longer sections. Maybe the author simulates what he imagines would be the voices of the writers of each section too well - most of these imagined writers aren't, well, good writers...2.5."

It makes a wonderful point embedded structurally in the text: Those whom get to write history, have the ear of the public, affluence, etc.—are predictable. Possessing the derivative nature of the privileged often deadens the actual brilliant persona and persons in history. A kind of erasure reserved for those of excellence that do not happen to be white rich men, typically. I think it does this pretty cleverly and the method keeps the pace going even when the craft there is very blasé. There are plenty of blank pages and formatting that clips you along. This is needed because the first entire half of the book is fairly trite. You need the the rush of flying through pages. Then, when the intertextuality examines said issues in the first half itself, it unlocks the Point, which does, I think, make it worth consuming. It’s ballsy, as I said, because I almost bailed on this thing multiple times for better reads because it’s essentially purposefully… bad. And at the start of the book. How many writers would try that?Ultimately, it kind of means I have to place it at three stars because of how I rate books (3 stars meets the expectations set by the text, 4 stars exceeds expectations, 5 stars more than that) -despite- being fairly novel when it comes to the conclusion, because the mark that it aims to hit—the expectations set by the novel—requires a slog and faith that isn’t completely apparent from the onset. Only for it to then just exactly make its point at the end. There’s no room to exceed my expectations. And it asks more of the reader to do so. If another reader really got on with the prose work and/or was particularly enamoured with a particular character voice, which, the last chapter I was happy to read partly because it -was- the only engagingly crafted voice, then I think it could easily be a higher rated book… for that reader. For me, the prose work is pretty consistently out-of-the-way and not much more. Bog standard contemporary voice, basically. Unusual structure would usually give it a boost, but again, it’s a point it barely pulls off. So yeah, it does the thing. With some daring. Which isn’t nothing. Is it worth reading? It really depends if you have the kind of stamina and faith in the writer to actually get to the end. And that you resonate with what the author attempts to communicate. I think it will be a difficult book to recommend to most people."

Not long after, his wife falls ill and dies in a Swiss sanatorium despite his best efforts to save her.The book comprises of one novel-within-a-novel, one corrective autobiography (or notes for it), one memoir of the man’s private secretary many years later, and one scribbled diary from the dying wife. Via these many turns around the same story, Diaz attempts to tell the history of money, the building block and religion of America but also at times its foremost taboo. As I say, there are some problems. A lingering coldness that is perhaps appropriate to the story but a problem for a reader faced with 400 pages of banking related drama (it was interesting reading this while markets wobbled and banks failed again last week). A misjudged tone to the first section, which reads like an antiquated American costume drama but would probably make more sense as a scandalous Capote-style account of the twenties. And although Diaz writes about finance with a measure of confidence, it didn’t really sound to me how finance people write about finance (perhaps this is better for everyone). But there are also some rewards. Ida Partenza, the Brooklyn born secretary, is a welcome lively addition at the midway point, and her father, an Italian anarchist with plenty to say about money and capital, is a great character, a really welcome addition.Diaz has said that classics of capitalism such as The Great Gatsby are not really about money so much as they’re about the eccentricities of the rich, and a catalogue of what money can buy. His aim was to write about money itself, and the making of it, divorced from what it can buy. Money is a cold and abstract idol, of course, and a book like this needs to work hard not to be cold and abstract itself. Trust only partially succeeds, but gets plenty of bonus marks for intellectual curiosity and my favourite father figure so far this year.3.5 stars"

La prima invece è quasi tremenda, le critiche scomodano nomi pesanti tipo Henry James (ma questo perché lo stesso romanzo, nella terza versione lo fa, però al romanzo sarebbe concesso, alla critica...), facendomi sospettare che non abbiano mai letto Henry James in vita loro, o forse non se lo ricordano.

Per dare un’idea, ecco come descrive il primo incontro tra i due:“Un’ombra esitò, proprio accanto a lei, sulla soglia che conduceva a un salottino. Helen notò che il suo profilo nero sul pavimento esprimeva la stessa esitazione – il rammarico di essere stata sorpresa, la mancanza del coraggio di andarsene, la riluttanza a farsi avanti.

Trust falls into my reading sweet spot. It’s clever, structurally inventive storytelling, that challenges its reader through form and content. It’s a book that is about a lot of things, big ideas that are woven together by connection between capitalism and fiction. I do love a good Ponzi scheme story, and Diaz dabbled close enough to that in this exploration into the financial world. Over a week later, I’m still thinking about the things Diaz has to say about truth and perception, fiction and finance. "

76,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11296522-fatma,Rating 4 out of 5,"A modern classic in the making, Trust is one of the most fascinating novels I've read all year. Trust is a novel that is, at its most basic level, about capital. This is very much front and center in its first section, ""Bonds,"" where one of our two main leads is the hugely successful and nigh indomitable Wall Street financier, Benjamin Rask. Here the novel plants the seeds of the ideas it's going to explore in its next three sections, namely the kind of mutability that is inherent to capital and the way it operates. That's where you get passages like these,""He became fascinated by the contortions of money--how it could be made to bend back upon itself to be force-fed its own body . . . It was the complexity of it, yes, but also the fact that he viewed capital as an antiseptically living thing. It moves, eats, grows, breeds, falls ill, and may die."" ""His reticence increased with his reach. The further and deeper his investment extended into society, the more he withdrew into himself. It seemed that the virtually endless mediations that constitute a fortune--equities and bonds tied to corporations tied to land equipment and laboring multitudes, housed, fed, and clothed through the labor of yet other multitudes around the world, paid in different currencies with a value, also the object of trade and speculation, tied to the fate of different national economies tied, ultimately, to corporations tied tied to equities and bonds--had rendered immediate relationships irrelevant to him.""So the novel is interested in looking at the many permutations of capital: how one thing is transmuted into another, all these different ""mediations"" that can and do make capital seem so abstract for those at the top pulling its strings. It's not a stretch, then, to go from exploring the permutations of capital to exploring the permutations of narrative. That is to say, more than just being about capital, Trust is also a (very meta) novel about narrative--and those two things are, in fact, inextricable. The structure of the novel--four sections, all told from different points of view--very clearly brings this thematic focus to bear. And Trust is such a cleverly structured story: its narrative asks some patience of you, but by its end rewards you tenfold for that patience. What started out as a somewhat slow-moving and dispassionate novel for me ended up being an absolutely fascinating and, in many ways, enthralling read precisely because it started out in that very deliberately slow, measured way from the outset. I love when literary fiction novels keep me on my toes, and Trust did that and then some. It went in directions I never expected it to go, and more than just being surprising, those little twists and turns made the novel so much more thematically rich and complex in the end.Much in the same way that capital is always subject to these ""mediations""--equities, bonds, land, etc.--Trust also gives us narratives about this famous financier character that are mediated by different authors and genres: a novel, a memoir, a journal. And the more you try to put your finger on what kind of person this man is, the harder it becomes to define him; accounts of his character are always shifting, transmuting across the book's many narratives and genres. Language, of course, plays a critical role in how these narratives work--in fact, what I loved so much about Diaz's exploration of narrative is how carefully he pays attention to language in his writing, specifically the parallels between the personal and the financial. The novel is called ""Trust"" and its first section is called ""Bonds""--the double meanings there fit right into what the novel is trying to do re: capital + narrative. But Trust takes this even further; it's also interested in asking questions about the relationship between the self and wealth: in what ways is the former caught up in the latter? And as much as the novel highlights how wealth is institutional--supported and perpetuated by all the institutions that work in one's favour because one happens to fall on the side of privilege--Trust is also interested in interrogating what it means on an individual level to accrue these almost unfathomable amounts of wealth. What kind of person would you have to be to be able to do that? Where does the drive to make so much money come from, and, ultimately, where does it lead?""Every single one of our acts is ruled by the laws of economy. When we first wake up in the morning we trade rest for profit. When we go to bed at night we give up potentially profitable hours to renew our strength. And throughout our day we engage in countless transactions. Each time we find a way to minimize our effort and increase our gain we are making a business deal, even if it is with ourselves. These negotiations are so ingrained in our routine that they are barely noticeable. But the truth is our existence revolves around profit.""Finally, I want to mention the writing, which is just pitch-perfect. (I highlighted so many passages, not just because they were interesting, but also because they were just beautifully written.) Trust is one of those rare novels that's so deftly and precisely written that not a single word feels out of place. You really feel like you're in such capable hands here because the writing is so measured, controlled in a way that makes it feel elegant rather than stiff. If the novel's structure--its different narrative genres--works well, it's because the narrative voice in each of its sections is distinctive, attuned not just to the genre in question (memoir, journal, etc.), but to the narrator who is giving us access to that narrative.""Her speculations reflected one another, like parallel mirrors--and, endlessly, each image inside the vertiginous tunnel looked at the next wondering whether it was the original or a reproduction. This, she told herself, was the beginning of madness. The mind becoming the flesh for its own teeth.""My review of Trust has, so far, been less about my opinion of the novel and more about its thematic layers. To me, though, those two things are equivalent: that is to say, I loved this book precisely because it was so thematically rich. Like Noor Naga's If an Egyptian Cannot Speak English, it's a novel that I found remarkably thought-provoking, propulsive by virtue of the strength of its compelling commentary and structure. As with Naga's novel, I started Trust feeling a bit lukewarm about it--but then it won me over, and the fact that it did just made me love it that much more in the end.Thanks so much to Picador for providing me with an e-ARC of this via NetGalley!"

80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo,Rating 3 out of 5,"Author Simon Winchester once suggested that the structure or framework for a book is more important than the words used in the narrative itself. Trust by much-celebrated author, Hernan Diaz, provides an interesting conceptual structure but, at least for me, without the well-developed characters or consistently distinguished prose needed to sustain it.My view of this popular novel by Diaz is quite against the grain of public sentiment, including the esteemed Pulitzer Prize committee. I fully understand why so many readers have found the book enthralling, for Trust does offer the reader certain enticements, including its 4 part format, a literary architecture designed to hold the reader's interest, much like a good mystery tale.Initially, my interest was established by way of a novel detailing the life of Benjamin Rask, a powerful Wall Street magnate on the order of a Rockefeller, Ford or Carnegie, with Ben, son of Solomon Rask, entertaining a vision well-beyond following in his father's shadow, instead breaking away from the family's established pattern of success in tobacco. The sentence structure & phrasings, were often oblique, including ""the repulsion between 2 magnets"", occasionally like bad translations, though this was primarily in the first section of the novel. In time, Benjamin Rask marries a woman named Helen & it is said that while they were intellectually compatible, they ""mediated each other's silences"", seldom speaking to one another.We then have commentary from the man who inspired the fictional work, Andrew Bevel, who is quite naturally an oppositional counterpart to his fictional self, as is his wife Mildred. Later, we have a 3rd view of Mr. Bevel, via a woman named Ida Partenza, daughter of an Italian immigrant father who is an anarchist with socialist or communist leanings & who publishes his own manifests. Ida has been enlisted by Bevel to fabricate the ""true story"" of Andrew Bevel & his wife Mildred, who Andrew proceeds to diminish in importance as Ida transcribes their relationship.Ida, represents an engaging woman who loves her dissident father, attempting to shield him from harm in an age that denigrated Italians as ""garlic eaters"" and put to death Sacco & Vanzetti, most likely innocent, hard-working Italian immigrants with more than a trace of garlic on their clothes. This is a time when many in America wanted to restrict immigration to a trickle, allowing only a few blond Northern Europeans to pass through Ellis Island.Lastly, in the 4th segment, we have the long-concealed sentiments of Andrew Bevel's late wife Mildred, discovered by Ida quite by accident within a notebook Mildred had penned while dealing with a lingering, eventually fatal illness. Both Andrew & Mildred were quite hermetically sheltered while young & never seemed able to socialize or to develop close friendships, not even with each other. Nonetheless, what we have at novel's end, beginning with Ida's intervention in part 3, is a complete dismantling of her husband Andrew, who is reduced to serving only as a ventriloquist's dummy for his wife Mildred, whose equations somehow caused the 1929 stock market crash, thus inviting the Great Depression but perhaps only because Andrew misapplied the equation. Andrew Bevel is quoted as saying that his family had ""always married personal gain to the public good"", though I recall little or no evidence of this balance. He also stated that ""our prosperity is proof of our virtue"" and that ""business is a form of patriotism"". I found these statements revealing & am sure that some of the so-called ""robber-barons"" made similar utterances.However, some fierce capitalist icons later gave away their fortune, as when Andrew Carnegie established a system of free libraries, without which someone like Ray Bradbury, by his own admission, might never have become a writer. Meanwhile, Henry Ford, an anti-Semite & an isolationist, participated in America's WWI effort against the Axis Powers but also engaged in efforts to end that war, promoting policies in quest of future world peace. The Rockefellers endowed universities & benevolent groups aplenty. What I found to be the primary flaw of Trust was the lack of dimension to the characters, perhaps excluding Ida & her anarchist father, the latter being someone I found a pleasant foil to Andrew & Mildred, initially profiled as Ben & Helen Rask. Both seemed, if not cardboard caricatures, very inelastic characters, substantially reducing my interest. After all, this was the ""Gilded Age"", a time when Edith (Jones) Wharton gave us memorable characters in The Age of Innocence & other novels. In this I will borrow a phrase from another 3* G/R reviewer who stated that Trust is ""what Ms. Wharton might have delivered if she were writing for Wikipedia."" In spite of my misgivings, I enjoyed aspects of the novel by Hernan Diaz. One could certainly do much worse than a 3* novel. *Within my review are the images of: author, Hernan Diaz; a Fifth Avenue, New York mansion during the ""Gilded Age""; the profile of a ""different Andrew"", surnamed Carnegie."

Good thing I got all those recs done in August.--Benjamin and Helen Rask are emblems of the “boom” years of the Roaring Twenties. Somehow, the stock market titan and his eccentric wife reaped untold profits year after year, predicting trends with magical prescience. He was the only one who survived, and even thrived, through the great Crash of ’29. All of this made this power couple intriguing, loved, and reviled. But of the major accounts of their lives, which one tells the truth? Who were they, really? Were they immortal or human?How Diaz unfolds this spellbinding, fascinating tale is pure genius. Each of the four parts portrays the fictional duo a different way: first, in a novel by a known author; then, in an unfinished, self-serving autobiography; then in a retrospective from the novelist who helped write that autobiography; then, through pages from the madness-inspired journal of the wife herself. That’s a dive with quite the degree of difficulty. I’m no expert, but I guess it requires imagining your characters, putting them through the fire…then stepping back and looking at them all over again from a brand-new perspective. Maybe one that doesn’t see them so favorably. So, just when you think you have a clear idea of why things worked out the way they did, the next section turns it on its head. Each of those sections felt authentic, real, and gripping. I balked a little at “Bonds,” the first section, when I saw absolutely zero dialogue, but I pushed through and got the fascination I wanted. Then I went to Bevel’s work and got even more beautifully confused: the author sought to refute everything in “Bonds.” You’d think that’s baffling, but I craved the answers. The novel ignites with Ida’s memoir. I loved the contrast between worlds: the anarchist father and the indignant tycoon, all with the backdrop of the Depression. I didn’t live that era, but I got it: if offered rent and food money during the darkest times to write a sordid, questionable biography at the subject’s behest, would you? Thus, those themes of the times emerge. Diaz forces us to think about our hero worship, to question why we’re enthralled with the money makers of the world. I don’t always understand the financial terms, but I did here, and I was interested to know if Rask was really the self-made billionaire as we’d been made to believe. Hmmm…The plot? Well, I almost declared that there was no plot. The story gets told twice, and it gets jolted with energy once Ida comes through. Then, Helen’s journal: Wow! Sure, it rambles, but stick with it. Believe me. The ending was unexpected and satisfying: it’s the explanation for which I was wishing, and even when I got it, I was pleasantly surprised. So, there is a plot, a storyline hiding in the haze. And it’s GOOD.Diaz’s reverence and respect for the female characters was appreciated and natural. Some novels just deify, but this starts from the core and skillfully communicates the women’s feelings and thoughts. Ida and Helen are detailed, textured, and simply wonderfully drawn. They both make the novel what it is: sharp, intelligent, and special. There’s a great connection there, though they never actually meet. That’s history at its finest, for my money. Hard to believe the Rasks aren’t real, but their story makes for a very strong representation of a controversial decade. One of the best historical fiction books of the last several years. Yep, it’s deserving of that Pulitzer. "

La novela de Hernán Díaz, sin embargo, merece toda la atención cosechada. “Fortuna” ofrece una original estructura de relato dentro del relato, con una urdimbre de voces que puede descolocar al principio pero termina por cobrar significado una vez que te adentras en la lectura (a mí esto me ocurrió especialmente a partir de la segunda parte). La originalidad del formato actualiza una novela de misterio con un trasfondo que nunca hubiera pensado que me interesara lo más mínimo: el mundo financiero del Wall Street de principios de siglo. La figura de Andrew Bevel y su misteriosa mujer Mildred ofrece una radiografía de la sociedad de la época pero se deja claro que nada es lo que parece. La presencia de Ida, la joven periodista de Brooklyn convertida en escritora, articula la parte más adictiva de la novela y deja claro, con su relación con su novio y su padre de ideas anarquistas, en apariencia en las antípodas de Bewel, cómo todos compartimos más de lo que creemos. Muy recomendable, muy bien escrito (adecuado a las voces de cada ocasión) y tan sorprendente como fácil de leer."

Forse lo avete capito a questo punto.Sono così rompiscatole che devo dare 3 stelle a questo libro attualmente osannato ed amato da chiunque, perchè, nonostante avessi grosse aspettative e nonostante mi sia impegnata ardentemente per farmelo piacere da matti, non ci sono riuscita. ""Trust"" è un romanzo ambizioso che si costruisce sulla fallibiltà della verità, quella ""trust"" del titolo che è insieme fiducia e anche fondazione finanziaria, in un gioco di parole speculare che incarna i parallelismi del romanzo: la fragile vacuità della ricchezza che si genera e autogenera cannibalisticamente, e l'altrettanto fragile apparenza delle cose viste dal di fuori, l'inconoscibile vita nascosta del privilegio. Esistono varianti che possono far oscillare i mercati azionari e che sembrano impossibili da prevedere, così come in questo romanzo, la variante impazzita, incalcolabile e misteriosa, è Mildred, la moglie morta del ricchissimo tycoon Andrew Bevel, attorno a cui si svolge l'intero romanzo. Peccato che, dopo una prima parte densissima e promettente (un vero plauso alla narrativa di inizio novecento con echi di Warthon e James), Hernan Diaz sembri aver perso la voglia di andare a fondo nella sua storia, e pur portando avanti l'esperimento di commistione di generi letterari con grande bravura, non riesce mai ad arrivare davvero al cuore pulsante della materia. Ho trovato molto deludente soprattutto l'ultima parte in cui dovremmo arrivare finalmente a conoscere Mildred attraverso le sue stesse parole, e che risulta forse come il passaggio più raffazonato e meno interessante dell'intero romanzo, con rivelazioni che non sono tali visto che erano già intuibili fin dalla prima sezione.Chiusa l'ultima pagina (però la frase finale è bellissima, no?) si ha la sensazione di essere rimasti un po' a bocca asciutta, rimane la voglia di voler sapere meglio e di più. Peccato."
87,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"An intriguing puzzle box of a novel containing several 'documents' about the life of an early 20th century American financier. It is for the reader to guess what is true and what not.I read this a couple of months ago but postponed rating it to better understand how I felt. There were some reasons I was unsure:- Amazing debuts not only set the bar high for the second novel they also make readers long to indulge in more of the same. At least, that is a little bit what happened to me. And Trust is very different the incredible In the Distance (which I found much better).- Other readers here on Goodreads pointed out, with good arguments, some flaws in the novel that I had not noticed but have to agree with. - The final revelations felt a little bit like open doors.Still, I was definitely having a good time while reading the novel. I enjoyed the good writing and was engaged until the end. I was willing to go along with Diaz' experiment (which apparently is not as innovative as I thought, see Trust Exercise by Susan Choi). I found the subject matter of financial crashes interesting and original - I guess many literary writers shy away from it. Solid 4 stars, I don't think it will make the shortlist. But: this is a writer you can trust will do something innovative and interesting, he writes very well and I will read whatever he publishes next."

I can understand the Booker nomination completely.In Trust we are given 4 separate parts of the same story. Essentially it's a story within a story within a story within a story but that makes it sound complicated and it's not.The first part is a novel about a man who is a Wall St tycoon and his wife. The second part is an unfinished biography about the same man who is incensed about the lies told by the first novelist. The third part is the story of the woman who wrote/transcribed the biography. The fourth part is the truth behind it allThankfully you don't need to know anything but the basics of stocks and shares. What I got in this book was pure magic. I've seen some less than complimentary reviews. I have to say I disagree with them totally. I thought this continued the beautiful, lyrical writing we got from In the Distance. Both books describe an America that is long gone, both books (whilst not of great length) are epic in quality. Highly recommended. I hope it wins the Booker. It certainly deserves to.Thanks to Netgalley for the ARC."

90,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54028986-dan,Rating 5 out of 5,"Hernan Diaz’ Trust is a multilayered historical novel of New York society and American capitalism in the two decades before the Great Depression, during which ""New York swelled with the loud optimism of those who believe they have outpaced the future."" Diaz asks us whom do we trust to unpack the mystery of Mildred Bevel’s life, a wealthy woman with an old New York society pedigree and married to Andrew Bevel, an asocial New York financier with an equally distinguished pedigree? Hernan Diaz’s Mildred is obviously intended to remind us of Henry James and Edith Wharton’s women, brought up largely “on the Continent,” schooled in music and literature, and well versed in pleasant conversation. In Trust, Hernan Diaz looks through four different lenses, each with a different and distinct voice, to investigate the fictional Andrew and Mildred Bevel: “Bonds,” a novel by Harold Vanner, provides an account of the upbringing, marriage, and death of Helen Brevoort Rask, a fictional stand-in for the fictional Mildred Howland Bevel; “My Life,” the fictional memoir of the fictional Andrew Bevel, written by the fictional Ida Partenza; “A Memoir, Remembered,” the fictional Ida Partenza’s own memoir of her youth and employment by Andrew Bevel; and “Futures,” the fictional fragmentary late life diary of the fictional Mildred Bevel, discovered by Partenza and smuggled out of the Bevel library following his death. Using four different perspectives with four different voices examining a fictional couple is a clever device, but where Hernan Diaz really slips the bounds of conventional fiction is in “My Life,” Bevel’s memoir. Remember that ""My Life,"" Bevel's memoir, is in fact written by Ida Partenza: I would no longer try to capture Bevel's voice. Instead I would create the voice he wishes he had"".. Diaz here challenges the reader to bear with him in reading Andrew Bevel’s braggadocio about his mathematical prowess and unique skill in understanding and predicting market movements. Bevel’s description of the sainted Mildred borders on the comic, evoking the “little woman” of wealthy domesticity: ""Mildred was my muse. Because of her, an already successful career soared to new heights."" “My Life” is, I suppose, intentionally simultaneously boring and maddening, doing little or nothing to evoke sympathy for Andrew Bevel but doing much to reveal him through his self-mythologizing. “A Memoir, Remembered” yields a much fuller portrait of Andrew than his own “My Life.” The heart of Trust lies not with Andrew but with Mildred and Ida, the two women who truly dominate the narrative. Mildred emerges in “Futures” as a far more accomplished and nuanced and accomplished character than portrayed by Andrew in “My Life” or by Harold Vanner in “Bonds.” Ida Partenza, Bevel’s amanuensis, also emerges as a fascinating character in her own right, and as a determined miner into Mildred’s true personality and accomplishments. A particular delight of Trust is the capitalist egotism and self-justification mouthed by Andrew, matched by the American Marxist cant voiced by Ida’s anarchist immigrant father. Here's the hateful Andrew: ""Whatever the past may have handed to us, it is up to each o bus to chisel our present out of the shapeless block of the future. My ancestors offer abundant proof of this. We Bevels have lived through numerous crises, panics and recessions: 1807, 1837, 1873, 1884, 1893, 1907, 1920, 1929. Not only have we survived them, but we have emerged stronger, always keeping our nation's best interest at heart."" Bevel again: ""A nation's prosperity is based on nothing but a multitude of egoisms aligning until they resemble what is known as the common good."" And here's Ida's father: ""Money is a fantastic commodity. You can't eat or wear money, but it represents all the food and clothes in the world. This is why it's a fiction. And this is what turns it into the measure with which we value all other commodities. What does this mean? It means that money becomes the universal commodity. But remember: money is a fiction. . . "" I can’t speak to the accuracy of the capitalist voice, but the Marxist cant is spot-on for this particular slice of Americana in the first half of the nineteenth century. For me, Trust stands as an entertaining, stylish and clever historical novel. Hernan Diaz dares to take chances with his two novels, and I find that those chances richly reward me as a reader. 4.5 stars"
91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17817646-ann,Rating 4 out of 5,"This novel exemplifies literature as art. The novel consists of four “books” by different authors all about the same stock market magnate and his wife during the 1920’s (and all, of course, written by Hernan Diaz). The first is a novel of the life of the main characters, the second is a self-serving autobiography written by the main male character, the third is a memoir written by the biographer of the family and the fourth (most wonderful for me) is the diary of the wife. Each of these “books” presents a different perspective on the family and its actions – but this is so much more creatively done that a novel that just has different characters’ points of view. Each of these “books” is its own, unique work, with its own, unique voice – and more importantly, its own, unique telling of the same story. Of course the facts are different, depending on which author is narrating - - so the novel raises the questions of “what is truth?” and “can you change truth (and memory) to fit your desires?”. The main male character is despicable, self-serving and arrogant (I’m trying to use acceptable words!) – but so incredibly well drawn. The main female character is highly intelligent, a victim(?), a schemer(?), a feminist (in her own world) – to say the least, she is complicated, interesting and wonderful. The writing is incredible in all respects. There are a lot of references related to financial and stock market matters and manipulations, and I know this has put some readers off. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and am in awe of Mr. Diaz’s writing and creative abilities."

In the end, I found it OK but not excellent. The idea is fascinating; telling more or less the same story through various means (a novel, an autobiography, the version of a biographer, and a diary). It makes you wonder what exactly is the true story? If there is a true story of course 😉. There is a revaluation in the end providing the reader with a believable truth though. I also liked the themes of money & capitalism, truth, misogyny, and women’s place in history. This book is smart and interesting but not all parts worked for me. I’m afraid the second part just bored me.Thank you Pan MacMillan and Netgalley UK for the ARC."

94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2964817-marc-kozak,Rating 4 out of 5,"I enjoyed this quite a bit but I suspect my estimation of it will fade over time, and I'm not at all surprised to see a vast constellation of star rankings among my GR friends. I think your enjoyment of this will come down to two main factors:1) Your willingness to stick through fairly long narratives that are intentionally bad and/or boring. Trust as a novel is made up of four different sections told in four wildly different styles, and each successive section sheds more light on the previous sections. The fun of it all is picking out things in the later sections that shed new light on what you read earlier, as each little mystery is unraveled pretty neatly by the end. It's pretty entertaining if you stick with it. The third section is where things really begin to snap in focus. However, the third section starts around page 194. And the first section is pretty long and kinda dry, and might have you wondering what the point of any of this is. So I can see why someone might attempt to throw the book into outer space well before getting to the good stuff.2) Your expectations of emotional and thematic impact. Since the structure of this thing doesn't really allow for traditional character development per se, you probably aren't going to latch on to anyone here (minus maybe the lead of the third section, who might be the only person who gets enough dedicated story time to feel like a real person). I will say I was pretty emotionally affected by the overall fate of one character by the end, so it's not like there's nothing. But you have to adjust your expectations accordingly. Or at least be willing to hold out to the end for such impact to even form. Again, you might not want to wait that long.And thematically: there are some interesting ideas here about the origins of American wealth, and the nature of capital itself (a dad character basically sums up the theme in a page-long rant in the third section), but it doesn't really go into the depth I would've liked. And there's not too much else going on here that we haven't seen before, outside of the narrative structure itself. So if you're already frustrated by that, you're bound to not have a good time all around.I feel like I'm giving a lot of warnings here and really setting up a potential reader to be more wary than excited about this. But give it a shot! I did like it! I mean, it was Booker longlisted! Diaz is clearly a talent, and he does a very good job creating a stylistic pastiche for each section. But again, if you're not down to see this experiment through to the end, you're going to be left disappointed. I wasn't! But you might be! Life is all about taking risks, people! You'll just have to put your trust in Trust hahahahahaha ok good day to you."
95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book is divided into four parts. The first part is a novel by a writer who knew a prominent financier and his wife. He based his book their life together. The second part is a ghostwritten autobiography by the financier, who has taken issue with the novelist’s portrayal and wants to set the record straight. The third is a memoir by the ghostwriter, documenting her life and the process of writing the financier’s memoir. The fourth is a journal kept by the wife of the financier toward the end of her life, which provides clarity on the motivations for all these happenings.There are quite a few interesting historical aspects of this book. It covers the rampant speculation leading up to the crash of the stock market in 1929. The ghostwriter’s father is a member of an anarchist group, which is at odds with her work for a financier and causes family conflicts. It will take a bit of patience to fully enjoy this book. I found the first two sections, the novel and “autobiography,” extremely dull. I almost gave up on it. Then we get to the third section, and I started to get interested. If the book had only consisted of the last two sections, with perhaps excerpts of the first two, I would have enjoyed it much more. As it is, I can only say I enjoyed half. "
96,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2352900-elaine,Rating 3 out of 5,"Very mixed feeling about Trust. The use of 4 separate ""pieces"" to comprise the whole of the novel (a novel within a novel, and three different ""memoirs"" written in very different styles) and to slowly reveal a secret was clever, and to give Diaz credit, it all really does come together at the end. The 4th piece, the shortest, and the most gracefully written, packs a big emotional punch and redeems some of the heaviness of what comes before.  Where I struggled with the book was that the first couple of parts really do drag on. While the belabored writing in these sections is intentionally ""bad"", it doesn't make vaguely written but very extensive discourses on the workings of the financial markets or the leaden prose of the first section any easier to read. Even the 3rd section, when the gears start clicking, has an awful lot of exposition. No need to be fancy about it, I just found this book more boring than it needed to be. I enjoyed the hat tips to Wharton, as I've been on a big re-reading kick lately, but the pastiche of her writing had none of her economy of style."

How about when structure and plot are so interwoven as to become integral to one another? That is what I discovered in the novel Trust. The story of a man and woman and their marriage, unique only in the immense wealth that the man controls. A story told in four parts; the man, the woman and the marriage viewed from different perspectives, each getting us closer to the truth. I wasn’t surprised by the ending. I am not sure I was supposed to be surprised. It is easy to focus Mildred Bevel/Helen Rask as the heart of this story, but I felt the character Ida Partenza played just as an important role. The brilliance of Mildred and Ida’s achievements, the roles that men played in their lives and how each managed those men was for me the story. The novel begins slowly and can seem dry at times, but I thought this was the beauty of the story being slowly revealed and the structure of the novel enabling that. This novel was perfect for me and for what I enjoy."

102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2518644-chadwick,Rating 3 out of 5,"It's funny sometimes how readers can see -- or want -- a different story inside a novel than the one the author decided to tell us.In ""Trust"" Hernan Diaz weaves an intricate narrative web to tell the story of a billionaire financier and his philanthropic wife. On its face, it's a story about the world of high finance as well as Andrew and Mildred Bevel's marriage: intimacy, trust, self-awareness, and deception. But I think it's really a meditation about storytelling itself. What is truth, who gets to tell (and control) a story, and what is the perception and posterity of that story? The structure of his novel -- which includes a fake novel, a fake memoir, and a fake diary -- is a bold and clever way to pick away at these issues of truth and perception. Diaz certainly doesn't lack ambition. But that very structure, although inventive, is a cumbersome edifice that ultimately limits how Diaz can tell his story.The story I really wanted to read was one that Diaz buries in the middle as Part 3: the story of Ida (an employee of Andrew Bevel) and her father (an anarchist Italian immigrant printer). Far be it from me to critique Diaz's storytelling decisions, but I can't help but wonder how this novel might have played out as an expanded version of Ida's story. Through Ida's storytelling -- past and present -- Diaz could have told the same story about the Bevels and still gotten at the same issues of truth and perception; secrets and lies; money and power.And that gets at another issue I had with ""Trust."" It's a novel that's often strangely lifeless and dispassionate. That's all the more surprising because Diaz's first novel, ""In the Distance,"" had verve to spare and explodes with life. I fell in love with that novel. But here, it's almost as if Diaz can't get out of his own way. He's tied his own hands together with the novel's structure. I get what he's trying to do with the intentionally stodgy prose of the first two parts (the fake novel and fake autobiography), but unfortunately it all feels . . . well . . . stodgy. ""Trust"" only fully comes to life when we meet Ida. Put another way, it's not just Ida's storytelling that is the best part of the book, it's the actual story of Ida and her father. I wanted more. Ida's segment ended too soon, and too abruptly at that.I also found the ending a disappointment. The big ""reveal"" wasn't a surprise at all. Not only that, the reveal had a forced tidiness and was clumsy in the telling. There's much to admire in ""Trust."" It's good, smart fiction. I wavered between 3 and 4 stars here, and considered rounding up based on how much I loved his first novel, but in the end, 3 stars felt right. Diaz is a prodigiously talented and creative writer, and I will definitely look forward to his next book."

A challenging, thought-provoking puzzle of a book, stories nested within stories like a nesting doll, set in the Gilded Age of the 1920s and 1930s, it presents a compelling look at the beginnings of capital as the engine for finance in America.Hernan Diaz has an additional agenda though. He dissects the question of who is telling a story, which story is the dominant one, and who or what has been altered or erased in differing versions? Therefore, the reader needs to pay close attention to the various parts of the novel and how they are related.I read this for a reading group and was concerned that it would be found unreadable or unlikeable by many of the members.

Mind a négy egyazon témát járja körül: a gusztustalanul gazdag Andrew Bevel és felesége, Mildred kapcsolatát, és mindegyik tulajdonképpen arra a kérdésre van kihegyezve, hogy ki is volt valójában az asszony. A téma tehát azonos, de ettől eltekintve a szövegek különbözőbbek nem is lehetnének: más a stílus, más az elbeszélő, és persze válaszaik is tökéletesen elütnek egymástól. Az a fajta szöveg tehát, aminek milyenségét nem is annyira a részek minőségének átlaga határozza meg, hanem a részek közötti párbeszéd.Különben meg - ahogy én olvastam - az egész a bizalomról szól. Bizalomról abban az értelemben, hogy melyik elbeszélő értelmezését fogadjuk el. Triviálisnak tűnik ebből a szempontból az időrendiségre bízni magunkat: az első rész állít valamit, a második ezt a valamit cáfolja, a harmadik a cáfolat cáfolata, a negyedik pedig... hm, a negyedikre még visszatérek az utolsó bekezdésben. Akárhogy is, ebben az olvasói stratégiában elfogadjuk, hogy az igazságot az író egyre jobban kibontja, ergo a végén közelebb leszünk hozzá, mint az elején. Ugyanakkor lehetséges, hogy esztétikai szempontok alapján döntünk. No most az első rész remek - egyfajta klasszikus, Henry James-i finom prózai textus. A harmadik rész viszont még nála is jobb: erőteljes, okos, jól adagoltan drámai, és kiválóan építi fel az olvasó és elbeszélő közötti kapcsolat személyességét. Különösen a második résszel összevetve feltűnő a minőségi szakadék, ami konkrétan egy elvetélt vázlat, pongyolán szerkesztett előtanulmány valamihez, ami végleges állapotában is gyaníthatóan egy ellenszenves alak önmentegetőzésének tűnne. Tegyük hozzá: ez a rész azért ilyen, mert Diaz azt akarta, hogy ilyen legyen. Beáldozta a szövegminőséget azért, hogy elhiggyük, egy ellenszenves pénzügyi guru írta (íratta), aki azt se tudja, az irodalmat eszik-e vagy isszák. Ezzel pedig Diaz szellemesen megkerülte a problémát, miszerint: hogyan írjunk elfogadható szöveget, ha választott elbeszélőnk egyértelműen alkalmatlan elfogadható szövegek tolmácsolására. Akárhogy is, ez a második rész annyival rosszabbul van megírva a harmadiknál, hogy már csak azért is szívesebben hiszünk az utóbbinak, mert jobb olvasni. Holott ugyanúgy hazudhat, mint ahogy az addigi elbeszélők is a saját képükre formálták a valóságot. A tanulság: sose bízz az elbeszélőkben.Ravasz regény, szerettem is, mert szeretni szoktam a ravasz regényeket. Ugyanakkor valamiképp úgy érzem, a szerző kihagyott egy ziccert az utolsó elbeszélővel. Itt ugyanis maga Mildred tudósít minket utolsó heteiről-hónapjairól. Mint szöveg, ez egy működő rész, átjön a fájdalom, a szenvedés, amivel gyürkőzni kell, hogy egyáltalán egy értelmes mondatot le tudjunk írni. Ugyanakkor nem tesz mást, mint megerősíti a harmadik során kialakult elképzeléseinket - következésképpen Diaz mégiscsak taszigál vele minket valamiféle olvasat felé. Szerintem a mesterjátszma az lett volna, ha az utolsó szakaszban is azt teszi, amit az addigiakban: arra kényszerít, hogy revideáljunk mindent, amit addig tudni véltünk. Így csak simán jó regény lett, nem letaglózó. * Igazság szerint a négy rész közül csak kettő nevezhető regénynek. A maradék egyike inkább csak egy regény vázlata, a negyedik pedig egy hektikus, végletekig tördelt naplóbejegyzés-halom."

110,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16054419-katerina,Rating 3 out of 5,"3,5Книга состоит из четырёх частей, призванных очищать предыдущие, как луковку, от приукрашивания и фальши.1 часть. (Выдуманный) роман 1938 года под названием Bonds (игра слов с названием всей книги) — о великом финансисте Бенджамине Раске и его немощной, похожей на Му-му жене Хелен. Читал и обсуждал весь Нью-Йорк. Жалели жену, восхищались гением финансиста. 2 часть. Неопубликованные и недоредактированные мемуары финансиста Эндрю Бевела, послужившего прототипом чувака из первой части. 3 часть. Мемуары Иды Патренцы, гострайтера, нанятой Бевелом писать его мемуары. 4 часть. Дневник Милдред, жены Бевела. (Я слушала аудиоверсию на Сторителе, там четыре хороших рассказчика, рекомендую.)Задумка романа очень хороша. Все части работают только в связке и написаны так, чтобы стилистически отличаться друг от друга, но главной проблемой для меня оказалось вот что. Выдуманный роман в первой части — выглядит не просто как выдуманный, а вымученный, занудный. Это роман писателя категории С, а не Эдит Уортон. И финансист, и несчастная Му-му, ой, простите, Хелен — до того неинтересные герои, что трудно представить, что крутому финансисту Эндрю Бевелу пришлось писать опровергающие (и такие же занудные) мемуары и судиться за клевету. Сознательно ли Диаз написал такую поделку или просто не смог стилизовать лучше — я не знаю. Если бы первая часть была лучше, а вторая была бы написана гострайтером Алека Болдуина или Мишель Обамы, все было бы гораздо увлекательнее. А так получается, что все разоблачения третьей (понравившейся мне больше всего) части и финала — уже не очень-то и разоблачения. Мужики с Уолл-стрит — неприятные люди, и не такие харизматичные, как Бобби Аксельрод. Вот так сюрприз.Другой вопрос — это зачем вообще искать в романах правду. Вероятно, это некая типичная американская фиксация на стопроцентной прозрачности. Вспомните, сколько конфликтов в попсовой литературе и кино построено на том, что один из героев приврал другому о том, что он делал прошлым летом. Лично я всегда доверяю автору как рассказчику и создателю его собственного художественного мира, пусть и «на основе реальных событий». Врешь — ну и слава богу, лишь бы хорошо получалось. Каждый мир каждой хорошей книги для меня неопровержим, достоверен и целостен. Как я верю во вселенную Майлза Форкосигана или Старков с Таргариенами, так верю и реалистам. Напишет мне Филип Рот альтернативную историю в «Заговоре против Америки», а я и сижу, уши развесила.Я вообще склонна думать, что романы, где реальность изображена без прикрас и выдумки, скучны и бессмысленны. (Зачем тогда читать, если можно выйти на улицу и своими глазами посмотреть?) Для реальности у нас есть нон-фикшен, а для романов всё-таки нужны голливудские актеры в роли простых людей. Именно поэтому в мини-сериале по мотивам романа главную роль сыграет Кейт Уинслет."
111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6997828-bonnie-g,Rating 3 out of 5,"If Virginia Woolf had been tasked with deconstructing the work of Edith Wharton and Theodore Dreiser I suspect she would have written this book pretty much as Hernan Diaz did. Possibly it would have been slightly different since Diaz lives in the now world where the constant appetite for information makes it impossible to have heroes, but it would have been close.As a matter of craft this book is dazzling. In a nutshell Diaz wrote a novella which, if given to people without a cover or title page most would guess to be the work of Wharton. It is really enjoyable -- not a major work but a pleasant and well constructed one. The novella ends after roughly 100 pages and we begin to see what went on behind the curtain. First we see the turgid and badly crafted outline of an autobiography of the waspy wealthy man who ostensibly inspired the main male character in the novella, then we get the story of the plucky immigrant woman hired to to ghostwrite the book, and finally the journal of the odd and brilliant woman who came from an old family (by American standards) but whose family needed to find a well of cash, who ostensibly inspired the main female character in the novella. So we get the thing and the deconstruction of the thing and we do learn the truth of what really happened in a way that brings the whole thing together. It is impressive. Diaz is a superb writer. The problem is that the deconstruction left me not caring a lot about the story. I was stuck in the engineering and when you get stuck in the engineering, and you focus hard and come to understand the way a thing is constructed, there is no more magic. I like a little magic. Maybe the construction is a metaphor for the concept of heroes -- once we look behind to curtain the magic is gone and we are stuck with mere mortals who are not terribly enchanting. But that was pretty well covered in the Wizard of Oz and now I want my illusions back."

The novel consists of four parts, with each part representing a distinct text by a different author: a novel, a rough draft of an autobiography, a memoir, and a private journal. The texts overlap such that they are in conversation and competition with each other.While I was impressed with the concept, I found much of the book a bit boring, especially the first and second parts. Part 3 picked things up, and without giving anything away, there are some nice touches in Part 4 as well. But overall, this book didn't have as much to say about capitalism and outsized wealth as I had hoped. Not a waste of time, but somewhat of a disappointment."

117,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I won't even try to write a real review of ""Trust."" Many thoughtful people have already done so on GR and elsewhere. Instead, I will jot down some thoughts. Make of them as you will.First, I almost DNF-ed several times before I was half done. I just didn't see what the point was. Nothing of ""Trust"" that I had read so far could begin to explain to me why so many readers, including my estimable GR friends, were so enthusiastic about the book. And then, somewhere a bit past the halfway point the book clicked. And a DNF suddenly became a 4-star novel.Second, I really enjoyed how Diaz created a puzzle where the reader simply doesn't know who to trust. Indeed, that the reader doesn't even recognize as a puzzle until a passage or phrase sets something off. With newfound interest I turned the pages and detected clues, hints about something that went by me before. But were they really clues or, well, lies? Or mere misdirection? Which story is true? Which parts of the story? And when a gender-based overlay is added (are women in the book devalued or is this simply part of the puzzle?), well, it gets murkier and murkier. The characters lie to one another, maybe to themselves. Or are they mostly lying to us?Third, I loved how this epistemological uncertainty bled into my perception of the world at large. Yes, ""Trust"" is fiction, a historic novel set largely between the 1870s and the Great Depression. But the topics, financial strategies, procedures, self-serving assertions -- all resonate today. Business transactions, buying on margin, collateralized debt obligations, quantitative analysis (today's Quants), they're all going on now. Have been for a long time, often to disastrous effect, as in 2008. And the attitudes about wealth, the deception, the BS delivered with a straight face. The business world is built on ""Trust,"" isn't it? On the shared perception that paper will have value, that obligations will be fulfilled. Fourth -- Business as the frame of fiction. Investing, Businessmen, secret deals, the men who have come to be known as Masters of the Universe. (And destroyers of economies.) Yes, other novels have been written ""about"" Business, but the only one I've read and liked was ""JR,"" by William Gaddis, and that was back when I was writing my doctoral dissertation on ""Gravity's Rainbow."" ""JR"" was nothing at all like ""Trust."" There's nothing like ""Trust"" that comes to mind.So yes, ""Trust"" is a puzzle. A truly enjoyable puzzle, particularly once I got past the halfway point and came to see that the stilted writing (yes, I know: Edith Wharton) was deliberately so and for a reason. The book plays with our emotions, our understanding of the world, of history. By the time I finished the book I could talk about the fun of reading it. Really. Trust me.One last thing: Did anyone else find themselves thinking of ""Citizen Kane"" as they read? I was half-expecting a Rosebud moment. Maybe it was just me."

Secondo Diaz nessun autore americano lo fa, non Fitzgerald con Gatsby (da lui citato), non i successivi (boh, su due piedi non viene in mente nessuno, anzi si, London con Radiosa Aurora, personaggio che Andrew mi ricorda abbastanza). Si narrano, da diversi punti di vista, le vite di Andrew e della di lui moglie. Il romanzo è suddiviso in quattro parti,  La prima parte in modo volutamente asettico, la seconda sotto forma di memoir scritto da Andrew, la terza come racconto in prima persona della segretaria e poi scrittrice che ha aiutato Andrew a scrivere il memoir, la quarta il diario della moglie  e la terza è quella sicuramente più interessante come tessitura, scrittura e sviluppo. Mentre l'epifania della quarta, ampiamente prevedibile, è ben costruita (se qualche esperto musicale mi spiega la chiave di lettura delle note gliene sono grato) .

I thoroughly enjoyed the 3rd and 4th books the most. I think this had a lot to say about women and the role that women (daughters and wives especially) play in the lives of powerful men, the leaders of business and industry. I can see the adjacency for Obama.Author Hernan Diaz had a lot to say about perception. Rich people want to appear just a certain way. They have specifics around how others perceive their legacies. Trust goes into the ways that people harm individuals on both macro and micro levels to shape their narratives. It's also about intimacy, jealousy, inferiority complexes and the ways that people shrink themselves or make themselves appear larger in the company of others. What that does to how people live their lives. How art, writing, and philanthropy is used to control and gain favor. I love a period piece drama and I pictured the setting of the HBO series the Gilded Age while reading various parts of this book. 3.5 rounded up!"

The first is a novel by Harold Vanner, The next two are memoirs and the final part is a diary. All these sections are linked, which means that Trust is a post modern novel.The Vanner novel is about a the child of a wall street tycoon, who inherits his fathers’ tobacco company and has a knack for making money, thus becoming richer, mainly through a trust fund. He eventually marries a European based American woman, who uses the money for philanthropist means. She will die (it’s not a spoiler)The next section is a memoir by A wall street tycoon called Andrew Bevel. Every detail of his life mirrors the Vanner book. At this stage the reader realises this but, at least in my case, not too sure how both sections connect.The third section is a criticism of the Bevel memoir, also in the form of a memoir by Italian immigrant Ida Partenza. She is hired to ghost write bevel’s memoir as we discover that the Vanner book is a fictional account of Bevel’s life. Albeit an incorrect one. Bevel trusts Ida to write something faithful but her research proves otherwise. Also being the daughter of an anarchist/Marxist father and working for a rich man puts their relationship into doubt. Still Ida carries on wondering who portrayed Bevel’s wife accurately.The final part brings this to light,Trust is primarily a historical novel: it details the rise and fall of Wall Street in great detail. It also is about the affect of the Italian risorgimento on Italian political beliefs. Which does makes sense as one is about the glorification of money, while the other goes into the absurdity of it. Through the use of multiple sources the book is about the unreliability of a narrator and how history change be changed on paper.Using different narrative voices Trust is an impressive feat as it emphasises on how different stories shape our lives . While a lot of post modern novels are praised for their technique, Trust is both style and substance combined beautifully."

I understand that the partial autobiography was not supposed to make for great reading, but I was very happy that it was the shortest of the four sections.

My stern lecturer, Dr S.J., told me that metafiction had died in the 90s and writing it now felt a little outdated. I trusted her, mostly because she was a formidable presence in her frowsty, overcrowded office. And yet, here we are. Trust is one of the few books from the Booker Longlist last year I didn't get to because the library reservations on it were stacked through the roof. And because it was at a nearby city library and not my own hometown. A novel inside a novel, multiple narratives, slowly peeling back the layers of the truth. I wondered why Diaz had called it simply Trust, it felt like a title that didn't truly capture what the book was about. Or rather, I thought there were bigger and more complex things going on and choosing a relatively simple word was underwhelming. The more I think about it, the more I realise that calling it ""trust"" is quite clever, particularly because we are reading a metafiction book. There is mistrust between characters but the greatest mistrust is by the reader themselves as they read. What narratives do we trust? How do we trust in a narrative inside a narrative? Diaz's prose is a little stilted at times, it's certainly inspired by (as one character even identifies about one of the narratives in the book that we read as readers too) Henry James, Wharton, et al. I suppose that was the point. It's uneven across its four parts. When I began I foresaw a 4-star read but over the 400 pages or so I lost my original spark of excitement. The structure is one of the most interesting things about the book. I'm glad I read it, but also not surprised it didn't make the shortlist. That said, it should have made the shortlist in light of how bad the other books were. Last year's list really did offer me a handful of duds. Hoping this year is more exciting. "

Und ein Mann profitiert davon besonders. Selbst beim großen Börsencrash 1929 fährt er saftige Gewinne ein. Welche Art Mensch ist er? Und wie ist dieser erstaunliche Erfolg bloß möglich?„Treue“ ist ein Roman von Hernan Diaz.Meine Meinung:Der Roman gliedert sich in vier Teile, die als Werke unterschiedlicher Urheber ausgegeben werden: der Roman „Verpflichtungen“, eine Autobiografie, ein Memoir und ein Tagebuch, erzählt aus verschiedenen Perspektiven. Ein interessanter und gut durchdachter Aufbau.Die Geschichte fokussiert sich auf die 1920er- und 1930er-Jahre, umspannt aber auch weitere Jahrzehnte. Ihr Schwerpunkt liegt in New York.Sprachlich variiert der Roman sehr stark. Das passt einerseits hervorragend zu den verschiedenen, teils unzuverlässigen Erzählstimmen, ihren jeweiligen Hintergründen und Intentionen. Andererseits sorgt dies dafür, dass mich manche Teile mehr, manche weniger angesprochen haben. Vor allem der zweite Teil ist in stilistischer Hinsicht kein Vergnügen. Festzustellen ist aber, dass es der Autor trefflich versteht, mit Sprache umzugehen. Immer wieder tauchen kluge Sätze und Gedanken auf, die man sich merken möchte.Für mich gibt es im gesamten Roman keine klassischen Sympathieträger. Dennoch haben wir es mit reizvollen Charakteren zu tun, die bewusst ein wenig ambivalent und diffus bleiben. Inhaltlich dreht sich die Geschichte - zumindest vordergründig - um Reichtum, Macht, Moral und Deutungshoheit. Der Handel an der Börse und die Finanzwelt nehmen breiten Raum ein. Davon sollte man sich jedoch nicht abschrecken lassen, denn es gelingt Diaz sehr gut, diese Themen verständlich zu machen. Darüber hinaus steckt aber noch viel mehr darin, wobei ich an dieser Stelle nicht zu viel vorwegnehmen möchte. Ich kann allerdings verraten, dass Täuschung und Wahrheit weitere zentrale Motive sind. Alles in allem ist die Geschichte facettenreich und vielschichtig angelegt.Auf den mehr als 400 Seiten gibt es durchaus kleinere Längen. Durch die unterschiedlichen Perspektiven kommt aber dennoch keine Langeweile auf. Zum einen kann der Roman immer wieder überraschen. Zum anderen entsteht ein spannendes Verwirrspiel, was den Lesesog noch verstärkt. Sobald man glaubt, man habe verstanden, wie sich alles zugetragen hat, lässt ein neues Mosaiksteinchen das zuvor Gelesene in neuem Licht erscheinen. Erst am Ende ergibt sich ein vollständiges Bild. Dann wird die Gesellschaftskritik in Gänze ersichtlich, die dazu führt, dass der Roman noch länger nachhallt.Nur ein kleines Manko: Der deutsche Titel kommt bei Weitem nicht an die Mehrdeutigkeit des englischsprachigen Originals („Trust“) heran und passt nach meinem Empfinden nur mäßig gut zum Inhalt. Mein Fazit:Mit „Treue“ ist Hernan Diaz ein in mehrfacher Sicht ungewöhnlicher und kreativer Roman gelungen. Eine besondere Geschichte mit vielen Ebenen, die zwar ein wenig Ausdauer erfordert, die sich aber lohnt. Eine empfehlenswerte Lektüre und ein Lesehighlight des Jahres 2022."
132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,Rating 3 out of 5,"“History itself is just a fiction—a fiction with an army. And reality? Reality is a fiction with an unlimited budget.”My synopsis for Bookmarks magazine: “Set in the 1920s and 1930s, this expansive novel is about the early days of New York City high finance. It is told through four interlocking narratives. The first is Bonds, a novel by Harold Vanner, whose main character is clearly based on tycoon Andrew Bevel. Bevel, outraged at his portrayal as well as the allegation that his late wife, Mildred, was a madwoman, responds by writing a memoir—the book’s second part. Part 3 is an account by Ida Partenza, Bevel’s secretary, who helps him plot revenge on Vanner. In the final section, Mildred finally gets her say. Her journal caps off a sumptuous, kaleidoscopic look at American capitalism.”Ghostwriter Ida’s section was much my favourite, for her voice as well as for how it leads you to go back to the previous part – some of it still in shorthand (“Father. Describe early memories of him. … MATH in great detail. Precocious talent. Anecdotes.”) and reassess its picture of Bevel. His short selling in advance of the Great Depression made him a fortune, but he defends himself: “My actions safeguarded American industry and business.” Mildred’s journal entries, clearly written through a fog of pain as she was dying from cancer, then force another rethink about the role she played in her husband’s decision making. With her genius-level memory, philanthropy and love of literature and music, she’s a much more interesting character than Bevel – that being the point, of course, that he steals the limelight. This is clever, clever stuff. However, as admirable as the pastiche sections might be (though they’re not as convincing as the first section of To Paradise), they’re ever so dull to read. Still, I’m predicting this will make the Booker Prize shortlist tomorrow.Originally published on my blog, Bookish Beck."

Will elaborate more once I’ve gathered my thoughts.Hats off to Hernan Diaz for a book that felt structurally unlike anything I've ever read. This is the story of a marriage between a famous financier and his wife, who move through the upper echelons of New York City society in the 1920's and 30's. But this book is separated into four parts, each one of them tells you a slightly different story and paints these characters in different lights. This fictional famous financier became even more famous for shorting the stock market in the 1920's causing the (very real) great depression. And as his wealth grows in stark contrast to the poverty taking over the city in the 1920's and 30's, he attains this mysterious sort of status within the media and gossip circles of the day. The rest of what happens within this marriage is subject to the narrator you're reading from, so it's very much up to the reader to decide what is true and what is fabricated. Such an interesting concept and definitely intriguing enough to keep me flying through this book. I found the writing a little pretentious and there were a few slow parts during one of the sections that I didn't care much for, so not perfect for me. But the end was fairly satisfying and I'm mostly just very impressed by the creativity of concept with this one. If you are interested in the financial decisions that caused the great depression, the New York City society life, or the 1920's/1930's generally I think this historical fiction would work even better for you than it did for me.

I couldn’t figure out WHY this collected so many stellar reviews much less garnered a tie for the coveted Pulitzer Prize.Which was exactly the point, because the author (without giving away any spoilers) purposefully writes an excruciatingly dull biography of a financial tycoon and his mentally ill wife during the backdrop of the 1929 stock market crash. Why? I can’t say, but after finishing that section, which I’m glad I gave this a second whirl, the author takes you into a deep dive of intrigue, unreliable narration, and the slanted truth from vastly different perspectives and ulterior motives. Genius in its conception, yet moderate in its execution because I nearly gave up on it the first go-round. If not for the reviews - for example if this an ARC rather than one I had bought - I never would have kept reading, and it would have been inadvertently tossed into the black hole of my DNF pile.Still, the end was highly unexpected and fully brings the story full circle with imaginative elements and deft aplomb.

To the extent this may be an homage to early 19th century American authors like Wharton, I can see that the writing does reflect that, but I found it lost a lot of the essential humanity of the writing of those authors. This may be a reflection of the main character being somewhat stoic, but I’m not sure. This is definitely an ambitious and masterfully written novel, but it often left me bored in places. Good reflection on relationships (husband/wife, father/daughter), generational wealth, and financial systems. "

Brincando com o leitor e com a narrativa, é assim que o escritor compõe uma obra que se desdobra em outras mais, sendo tão cativante como o mundo de Gatsby, tão estranha quanto Olga Tokarczuk em Sobre os Ossos dos Mortos, e cercada de mistérios como Berta Isla de Javier Marías.Com enfoque no poder, no dinheiro e nas ambições que estão a volta do mercado financeiro, a ascensão de um magnata e sua esposa são o foco de eventos que perpassam o século meio a manipulações, mentiras e ao poder do dinheiro em manipular a realidade, ocasionando diversas realidades para um só fato. Apresentando a história principal como uma onda, ao longo do seu trajeto ela vai sendo desconstruída, quebrada, remontada, até virar algo novo que pode ser tanto uma nova verdade ou uma nova mentira, assim como pode ser reflexo de vida ou de morte, em um espiral caótico de eventos que ora nos imerge, ora emerge.Falar mais que isso certamente estragaria a experiência de quem deseja ler a obra, portanto, se existe uma boa representação de literatura contemporânea, não convencional, inteligente e que prende o leitor (embora eu entenda que nem todos devem gostar), Hernan Diaz deve ser um dos seus operadores.

The first section pretends to be a roman à clef written in the 1930s; some reviewers have compared its style to Edith Wharton's, but don't believe it. Its prose is absolutely dead, lifeless; usually I loathe it when reviewers drag out the ""telling rather than showing"" cliché, but here it applies. It is all telling, all plot and description. There is one word of dialogue. One. Actually there is one letter of dialogue: ""I.""""I.""When his pause became long enough to be final, she turned to him curious about the rest of his sentence. His inability to finish it had hardened his features.The second section, an unfinished, ghostwritten memoir, is even more wooden. Finally, at p. 195, we arrive at a third section which is written in a more standard literary fashion, with not just plot but dialogue, but by this time who cared? Not I.I found Diaz's writing about Wall Street finance bizarre and over the top. Clearly he's disgusted by it, and by his central protagonist, a financier, but he also tries to spin it into something mystical and borderline wondrous. The first three sections portray the financier as a complete genius; in the final section we find out that it's his disrespected wife who was the true financial genius, teaching her husband all he knew and instructing him what stock positions to take - but who can take her seriously either? As a young woman she would entertain at dinner parties by reciting memorized sentences from two different books in different languages, alternating between the books, ""then do the same thing starting at the end.""Unreliable narrators have been done to death but the critics fell all over themselves praising this particular metafictional, postmodern one.

- Il mio lavoro consiste nell'avere ragione. Sempre. Se mi sbaglio, devo usare tutti i miei mezzi e le mie risorse per piegare e allineare la realtà al mio errore, in modo che cessi di essere tale.

Durante la lettura di questo romanzo più volte mi sono chiesto perché mi coinvolgesse così tanto. Quantunque piano piano si capisca che c'è un mistero da svelare, sicuramente non è un thriller dai colpi di scena elettrizzanti. Inoltre il tema della finanza risulta facilmente respingente, e poi perché a un certo punto un immigrato italiano anarchico si prende la scena? Cosa mi sta raccontando questo libro, cosa vuole da me?Il principale motivo che mi sono dato è che questo romanzo è scritto elegantemente bene, aiutato probabilmente da una felice traduzione. C'è una attraente scorrevolezza e un modo affascinante di entrare nel profondo dei personaggi, nei loro sentimenti e motivazioni, attraverso una asciutta ma calda empatia. È interessante anche l'intreccio legato strettamente al quadro storico: le numerose crisi finanziarie a cavallo tra '800 e '900 (soprattutto il grande crollo di Wall Street del '29); oppure i trattamenti clinici dei disturbi mentali, che vedevano contrapporsi la ""terapia della parola"" ai primi elettroshock.Ma forse qualcos'altro è più importante. Il fascino irresistibile della ricchezza e l'esercizio del potere, ancor più se non manifesti. E allora perfino un anarchico di ferro potrebbe accettare dei compromessi? E chi ha davvero il potere?"

É certo, também, que a estrutura do romance é curiosa, permitindo “brincar” com as várias versões da mesma história. E é aqui, acho eu, que reside toda a suposta novidade que traz toda a crítica extasiada, como se nunca tivesse sido feito. De resto, nada mais banal. A história, enquanto tal, é pobre e a escrita não é nada de especial. Até a caracterização da época deixa muito a desejar, ao ser analisada apenas pelo lado do capital.Não fosse a história ser passada num dos períodos históricos que me são queridos e nem às três estrelas chegaria, coadjuvado pelo facto de ter uma tradução tão fraca como pedante (com termos como “Rebuço”, “Estratego”, “Chance”, “muitos títulos” - many ways, “Proventos” - income, e a cereja no topo do bolo, “Passamento” para Passing away, entre outros que nem me dei ao trabalho de registar).

It's organized into 4 parts: a roman à clef about a wealthy Manhattanite financier and his wife; an autobiography of the same financier; a retrospective memoir from a woman who helped the financier write his autobiography; a rediscovered journal from the financier's wife. Although Diaz attempts to spin a surprising tale of wealth, marriage, and power, the insights he tries to capture—the corrosive effects of money, how enough of it wipes away what is real and true—fall flat. It's a shame: a well-written book whose author is trying to say something—not always a given in today's literary landscape!—that nonetheless feels too careful. Diaz is absolutely right that money hides and blurs and tricks. Yet his narrative pads cautiously and loses this effect. The 4-part structure means that no reveal is given too early or too late. The story is straightforward, too simple to entertain and too undemanding to push the reader into reflection. Money and its effects are not clean but monstrously messy. This meticulous story undermines its own thesis, buying miserly control at the price of shocking excess. A book where you never once doubt or wonder what the author is trying to do and how he's making his attempt."

Then it became strange as the relationship between the two main characters—Benjamin and Helen Rask—took an odd turn (no spoilers).

It’s impossible to not start spoiling things at this point so I’ll stop here on any explanation of the overarching storyline of various narratives. It’s well done, albeit muddled and choppy (on purpose).Book 3 offers a new storyline and clearly illuminates Book 2.

173,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51338605-fede-la-lettrice,Rating 4 out of 5,"Quattro parti, quattro differenti scritti. Il primo è un tipico romanzo con il classico stile da romanzo storico, scorrevole, pulito e preciso, una gran bella scrittura che delizia il lettore. La storia si fa interessante e coinvolgente e la protagonista, Helen, è un personaggio incredibile, talentuosa, acuta, spinta da un forte desiderio di affrancarsi dalla tutela stretta dei genitori prima, e dal controllo del marito dopo. La donna cade intrappolata in un turbine mentale, che tanto mi ha ricordato Zelda Fitzgerald, e che sarà la sua condanna.La seconda parte è composta dalle note di un famoso finanziere che si appresta a scrivere la sua autobiografia per cui il testo risulta come un taccuino con brevi ricordi, accenni di fatti, scritti telegrafici e annotazioni veloci che rendono estremamente realistico il passaggio. La terza parte comprende le memorie, avvincenti e incalzanti come un giallo, di una scrittrice settantenne che ripercorre eventi avvenuti circa cinquanta anni prima quando era una giovanissima e povera aspirante scrittrice e fu assunta per redigere la biografia di un re della finanza. Lo stile qui è intimista e empatico e, ovviamente, in prima persona.L'ultima parte è riempita dal diario di Mildred/Helen (mica ve lo spiego chi è/sono😉) con il conseguente stile realista, diretto, personale e sbrigativo di questo genere letterario.Ogni 'libro' uno stile insomma, e non appena il lettore si abitua e si appassiona a ciò che sta leggendo, non appena si addentra nella trama e nelle dinamiche che la soppalcano, di colpo tutto si interrompe e inizia una nuova narrazione che confuta tutto quel che in precedenza era stato detto rimanendo spiazzato e confuso (molto piacevolmente secondo me).Questa prospettiva multipla crea un'audace sinfonia che è un po' arte postmoderna, un po' romanzo classico, un po' (tanto) metanarrativa e anche storia immaginifica, il tutto complicato dalla struttura a 'scatole cinesi' o 'a matrioska' che dir si voglia. A che scopo ci si domanda? Il libro, originale e interessante, vuole testimoniare con il contenuto ma soprattutto con la forma quanto una unica verità sia di fatto inesistente e impossibile da ottenere, da raggiungere perché sempre dipendente dal punto di vista che la raccolta; quanto fondamentali siano i sottotesti, le sfumature, i non-detti, i sentito-dire; quanto importante sia l'orecchio che ascolta o l'occhio che legge.Nella terza scrittura, un personaggio fondamentale afferma di non mentire mai, di essere sempre nel giusto, e se per caso la realtà dei fatti lo smentisce, beh, non è certo lui a mentire e a quel punto sarà sufficiente cambiare i fatti adeguandoli alla sua giustezza. Mi pare ciò dica tutto sulla percezione della verità. Diaz pone il lettore in una piazza quadrata, da ogni lato giunge, attraverso un diverso punto di vista, una parte di verità, di storia, ovviamente soggettiva, il lettore ascolta ogni versione, assembla i pezzi, cerca le risposte e scopre che in mano restano solo domande, che i nodi, lungi dal venire al pettine, si sono strettamente ingarbugliati, ma che il viaggio è stato adrenalinico, stimolante, avvincente e conclude che l'idea di Diaz è davvero potente.L'autore fa un lavoro molto interessante e intelligente sulle parole, sulla loro forma e sul modo di comunicarle, scrive un racconto, di un racconto, di un racconto evidenziando struttura, forma e stile; si spinge anche a coinvolgere il contenuto, come nella prima parte in cui Helen si ammala di schizofrenia, o per lo meno di ciò che ai primi del '900 definivano tale, e, a parte il resoconto orrorifico delle cure prestatele, Diaz fa in modo che la malattia mentale si manifesti proprio attraverso le parole: fluviali, confuse, plurilingue, mosse da un forte desiderio di spiegare un dolore dell'anima talmente profondo e terrificante che necessiterà, senza scampo, di essere detto, comunicato, sviscerato, spiegato ma inutilmente perché quelle parole, preziose e piene e intime, nessuno è in grado di capirle o vuole veramente ascoltarle, parole febbrili che dovrebbero costruire una descrizione dell'intangibile, parole fallimentari e presto sostituite da una forma violentissima di eczema (le parole del corpo) e dalla fuga reale e mentale di Helen (l'assenza di parole). Ogni parte del libro ha tematiche in comune, oltre alla verità e alle parole: il ruolo forte e fondamentale della donna, il futuro visto come un presente in avvenire, frutto di desideri e aspettative, e i soldi co(di)struttori di destini ""Perché il denaro è questo: tutto. O almeno può diventarlo. È la merce universale con cui misuriamo tutte le merci. E se il denaro è il dio tra le merci, questo, - aggiunsi mentre con il palmo rivolto verso l'alto disegnavo un arco che abbracciava l'ufficio e suggeriva l'edificio che lo conteneva - è la sua cattedrale""."

175,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27950748-jonathan-pool,Rating 3 out of 5,"The structure of the book was excellent. I thought at first that it was going to follow the Paul Auster’s  4321 idea of alternative lives. But it’s not that. Two characters enthralled me: Ida Partenza, is a young woman with a superbly independent spirit and a winning approach on how to conduct yourself at an interview.The second character I warmed to is the author, Harold Vanner. A man of mystery who ends the book as mysteriously as he started.Ironically the two other main characters (with Ida); Mildred, and especially Andrew Bevell, sit infuriatingly just beyond fingers reach. Mildred’s story concludes the book and we find depth for the first time, but Andrew Bevell is a pale imitation of Jay Gatsby or Charles Foster Kane, as all three share a period in time in America in the 1920s when business and the stock market boom and bust (in 1929) defined a generation. For today’s reader the machinations of the global financial markets are not by any means unfamiliar territory. Recent cryptocurrency fluctuations, and stock market gyrations in Covid lockdown, and during the USA initiated “sub prime” crash are fresh in the memory.For those people for whom stock markets are a shadowy and not very interesting element of democracies, this book may well have little allure; this will not be helped by the rather dry, and sometimes deliberately technical, style that Diaz chooses to explain financial markets.Given the chance factor of some of my reading over the last five years, the eventual reveals lacked originality for me. It’s a story that’s an unlikely combination of Michael Lewis’s  Flash Boys  and  The Wife  by Meg Wolitzer.The structure of the book, in four parts, will undoubtedly be the main talking point. I thought Diaz was very brave (or foolhardy) to create a whole section (in part two, comprising sixty-five pages), that was largely unreadable for the most part. Just when you have got your reader’s attention and engagement, it’s a questionable choice to throw in a whole chunk of prose that is deliberately poor. Diaz is also brave to offset two characters in a marriage, in which both are shy, reticent, and awkward. The absence of marital fireworks, of any sort, is unusual, so this element of the story sustained my interest.In summary I enjoyed reading this book but it is someway off my year’s top ten. Selected for the Booker Prize 2022 long list I suspect that this is as far as it will go. "
176,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5091119-ann-helen,Rating 5 out of 5,"I didn't have high hopes going in to this. In my review of Oh William, I said that I'm not a fan of books set in big American cities that focus on relationships and domestic life. Nor do I have an interest in economics and finance, despite the fact that I'm employed at a university that educates people within those fields of study (I have nothing to do with the educational side of my workplace, though). Since Trust is about a finance genius and his wife, who lived together in New York, it didn't bode well. And yet, I gave it five stars, and have (tentatively at least) put it at the top of my Booker longlist ranking, ahead of The Colony and Small Things Like These. There are two reasons for that: 1) This was such a fun book to read. I couldn't put it down. I wanted every new perspective, I wanted to see which aspects of their lives changed and stayed the same with each point of view, I wanted to know what the focus would shift to as the narrative progressed. I love books that feel like a puzzle that I have to figure out. Not as in mystery novels, though, more in the unreliable narrator/different perspectives way. In this novel you get one story from four different points of view, some closer than others to the events of the book. This gives the reader layer upon layer to uncover, and I think a second reading would be completely different from the first, without detracting from the enjoyment of it. 2) The psychology of the main characters. Diaz made me care about their lives and who they were and what happened to them. How have they gotten to where they are? Why do they act the way they act? How did Vanner's semi-fictitious novel influence Andrew? Did Mildred and Andrew have a good marriage? Why can't Ida forget about their story, even after fifty years? Who was Mildred, really? This doesn't mean that I liked them, though, I think that for most of the novel I didn't. They are not perfect angels or horrible villains, and how the reader views them changes with the changing points of view and with gaining more information. But they are fascinating. It's been a long time since I've read a novel this compelling, one that I think would be just as captivating on a re-read, albeit in a different way. Trust is definitely the biggest surprise from this year's Booker longlist so far. I'm hoping for even more surprises of this kind. "
177,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1976637-jeff-koeppen,Rating 5 out of 5,"Trust was one of my most anticipated books of this year as I loved Diaz's In The Distance. I'm glad I avoided all reviews and discussion of this book prior to reading it as its odd (to me) structure was a surprise and I had no knowledge of the plot or characters going in. I pounced on the Audible version as I had a road trip scheduled and was looking forward to getting lost in a great novel as the miles ticked by. It WAS great! Audible used four different narrators, one for each section of the book, matching the respective points of view of the particular section. The voice and tone of the narrators were great matches for the characters they represented. I can't recall ever reading a book structured as Trust was. Basically four different perspectives of the same events - primarily the boom in wealth and stock market, and subsequent 1929 crash of the market - centered around a successful financier, Andrew Bevel and his wife, Mildred. The first section is a novel within the novel, called Bonds, which happens to be about a successful 20th century financier named Benjamin Rask and his wife, Helen. The second section is Andrew Bevel's autobiography. The third section is the memoir of a woman named Ida Partenza who Bevel hires to help him flesh out and embellish his autobiography. The fourth section is written by Mildred Bevel. In each subsequent section you learn more about the Bevels personally and what made Andrew so successful on Wall Street. I felt that the novel got better as it went on as I had no idea where it was going for the first half or so. The third and fourth sections really ramped up my interest as a number of revelations were made about the Bevels. By the end I was bowled over, especially looking back at what I had just heard and how Diaz set it all up. You don't need to be interested in Wall Street to enjoy this novel, although knowledge of stocks, bonds, futures, etc. makes some of jargon understandable. It's really a novel about perceptions. Just like in In The Distance, the writing is excellent and just flows, and the story-telling is fantastic. Five stars."
178,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/994755-kathryn-bashaar,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book tells the life story of fictional financier Andrew Bevel from four different perspectives. The first section is a novel based on the lives of Bevel and his wife Mildred, fictionalizing them as Benjamin and Helen Rask. The Rasks are both portrayed as intellectually and socially rather unusual. In this version, Rask is a financial manipulator, and the cause of both the 1929 stock market crash and his own wife's death. The second section is Bevel's unfinished and self-serving autobiography.In the third section, the young woman Bevel hired to write his autobiography, Ida Partenza, tells her story. We see her first as a naïve young woman, desperate for a job, and later as a mature writer who goes back and tries to learn the truth about Andrew and Mildred Bevel. The fourth section consists of Mildred's journals, hidden for decades and finally uncovered by Ida. I don't want to say much more, because I want to allow future readers the delight of uncovering the truth bit by bit. The book appears on many ""best books of 2022"" lists for good reason. One testament to Diaz's skill is that the first two sections are so poorly written. He's such a good writer that he can mimic bad writing and still make it interesting. Like my reviews?

179,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3695758-suzanne,Rating 4 out of 5,"Thanks to my friend Kerry for recommending this book to me. Although I’d already been aware of it, I hadn’t developed any interest prior to her suggestion and I don’t know if I would have read this without her urging, but I was glad I did. There are lots of books that tell a story from multiple viewpoints, but I don't know that it's ever been done quite like this before. I enjoyed the unique structure of this as much as the story: an interesting take on, among other things, how easily money and power can manipulate truth. Although the book is set mostly in the 1920s and 1930s, that’s certainly a lesson for today as well. "

Told through different narratives that peel away from each other like onion skins, Diaz has a lot of fun here with the form, while also posing moral questions about the stock market, wealth and personal responsibility. A highly intelligent and pleasurable treat of a novel that is one of my early favourites for the next year."

Anche il personaggio di Mildred assume nel finale una crescente rilevanza non solo nel ruolo di artefice misconosciuta delle fortune economiche e sociali del marito, ma soprattutto, ciò che più ci interessa, nell’economia del romanzo dove finalmente l’ispirazione sembra prevalere o quanto meno equivalere rispetto alla necessità di incastrare debitamente il puzzle biografico. In quest’ambito ho trovato geniale e affascinante la scelta di interpretare una materia di per sè sterile, come l’andamento del mercato finanziario, come se fosse una partitura musicale il cui susseguirsi delle note insegue uno schema concettuale al contempo armonioso e predeterminato e in quanto tale prevedibile. Questa intuizione assume un significato ulteriore in quanto partorita dalla mente di Mildred in un mix irripetibile fra una genialità innata e favorita da un’educazione sui generis e d’altra parte l’effetto stupefacente della morfina.Al netto di tutte queste componenti, filtrate da uno stile deliberatamente disarmonico, l’insieme del romanzo si traduce in un’analisi della manipolazione da parte del potere allo scopo di «piegare e allineare la realtà»<(i> fino a sancire l’inaffidabilità dell’io narrante, indotto a barare per fini utilitaristici o inconsciamente psicologici, onde far corrispondere lo sguardo esterno e la percezione pubblica con la propria personale visione del mondo e delle sue infinite e contraddittorie sfaccettature."

Il secondo è la bozza di una biografia di un finanziere ""reale"" e di sua moglie.Il terzo (quello più importante) è una storia su due piani temporali riguardo ragazza che ha scritto la suddetta biografia; la parte nel passato narra del modo in cui è stata scritta, quella nel presente indaga su quella stessa biografia. Il quarto è un diario.Senza queste premesse, secondo me, è difficile capire (almeno fino alla terza parte) e apprezzare il libro.Devo dire che le uniche due parti che ho apprezzato sono la prima parte e la terza. Pur non capendo nulla di finanza la lettura non mi è risultata ostica e sono stata spinta a continuare per la curiosità che i personaggi mi hanno provocato.La nota dolente è che mi ha irritata molto il non capire lo scopo e la struttura del libro, se non quando sono arrivata abbondantemente dentro la terza parte.IIn sostanza non me lo sono goduta.La seconda e la quarta parte le ho trovate un po' ""inutili"" (anzi, la quarta per alcune cose è fondamentale, ma comunque aggiunge poco e nulla a ciò che abbiamo appreso nella terza parte) scritte a spizzichi e bocconi, e non è un tipo di stile che mi piace.Insomma per me Trust è stato una grande delusione ma il motivo principale risiede nel mio gusto personale: non amo lo stile così frammentato nè le trame così sperimentali e slegate.Credo però che agli amanti del genere possa piacere molto!"

In vier Teilen kreist der Autor immer wieder um neue Inkarnationen der gleichen Figuren, die er von anderen Blickwinkeln aus betrachtet, neu darstellt, in andere Beziehungen zueinander setzt. Im ersten Teil wird das Thema dieser literarischen Metafiktion vorgestellt: Wir begegnen im New York der 1920er Jahre Benjamin Rask, einem unglaublich erfolgreichen Börsenmakler und Geldvermehrer, der die junge Helen (zwar aus gutem, aber verarmten Hause) ehelicht. Beide raufen sich zusammen, richten sich in ihrer Ehe ein, bis sich auf einen Schlag das Drama bahnbricht.In den folgenden drei Teilen remixt der Autor nun dieses anfängliche Thema. Wir betrachten es aus einer anderen Erzählperspektive, dringen gefühlt immer mehr zum Kern vor und versuchen herauszufinden, wo die Grenze zwischen Fiktion und Realität verläuft (in einem – natürlich fiktionalen – Roman wohlgemerkt). Hernan Diaz spielt mit diesen beiden Polen, setzt sie in Beziehung und lädt den Leser ein, sich auf dieses metafiktionale Spiel einzulassen. Wer Spaß an Filmen wie „Inception“ hat, der wird auch an Diaz Denksportaufgabe Freude haben, die nie eine definitive Lösung haben kann.Der Argon Verlag sich für das Hörbuch vier Sprecher für die vier Teile des Romans gesucht, um auch im Hörbuch die verschiedenen Erzählstimmen überzeugend darstellen zu können. Damit lässt sich das Maximum aus dem Text herausholen und ich habe nicht bereut, zum Hörbuch und überhaupt zu diesem Titel gegriffen zu haben. Es empfiehlt sich, mit möglichst wenig Vorkenntnissen einen Kopfsprung in diesen Roman zu machen. So kann er am besten seine Stärken ausspielen und seine Magie entfalten."

I just knew this book was about money somehow.I have to offer minimal information. It's really best to come to this one and let the story unfold. The book is divided into four sections. Each section has a different POV on the same life. It is all an observation on wealth, money, perception, and pride.I kept hearing Annie Lennox and Aretha Franklin singing, ""Sisters are doing it for themselves ..."" as I got to the end. When Diaz can take me on a journey like this one, I am just amazed at the agility of his mind and his ability to sketch a life that is nuanced and complex by offering such differing view points.

203,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43614568-lyudmila-spasova,Rating 4 out of 5,"Удивително композиран роман, в която като обелки от лук сваляме пласт след пласт от сърцевината, в чийто център един финансист-мултимириардер, акула от Уолстрийт, който никак не прилича на Вълкът от Уолстрийт, и обвитата му в загадки съпруга, играят своя танц на живот и смърт, променят човешки съдби, но не могат да станат господари на своята, колкото и гласове и съвести да бъдат купувани. Историите често са измамни, версии на версии на версиите. Богатите създават, изкривяват, “нагласят, адаптират” реалности, в този смисъл те са творци на Историята, но не могат да променят живота. Парите могат да бъдат прехвърляни от едно измерение в друго, но не могат да създават живот. Парите са всичко, могъщ символ, мощен инструмент, но в същото време са нищо. Противоречива книга, която те провокира да търсиш още и още зад недоизказаната фасада. В първия момент краят ме разочарова, но сега виждам, че не можеше да е различен, не можеше да разкрие повече, защото така както аз виждам книгата, тя умишлено мултиплицира различни версии, а не ги потвърждава. Може би трябва да се доверим на някоя от тях, защото нямаме друг изход в този лабиринт. Затова смятам, че става дума именно за “доверие” (Trust) в смисъл на чия версия за действителността ще повярваме и аз лично така бих превела романа. Авторът ни предлага 4 различни версии за събитията, засягащи мултимилиардера Бенджамин Раск и съпругата му Хелън, респективно Андрю и Милдред Бевъл. Романът е разделен на 4 части, като първата е роман в романа, със заглавие “Връзки” от Харолд Ванър. Изящно написан роман, малко в стил Хенри Джеймс, с интересни, допълващи се герои, за които богатството е нещо второстепенно, свръхинтелигентни, преждевременно развити интроверти, за които спокойствието и личното пространство са централни. Отношенията между двамата съпрузи са изпълнени с уважение и зачитане свободата и интересите на другия. Трогателна, а впоследствие разтърсваща история за талантлива, баснословно богата двойка. Много ми хареса, въпреки мелодраматичната нотка, примесена с ужас и удивление. Втората част е озаглавена “Моят живот” от Андрю Бевъл, и както можете да се досетите представлява мемоарите на същото лице, което в първата част познаваме като Бенджамин Раск. Не издавам нищо, защото така или иначе бързо ще го осъзнаете и разберете. Тази недовършена, фрагментарна “автобиография” включва бегло нахвърляни бележки и други малко по-пълно развити части. Съмнението дали става дума за същите лица идва от доста различната версия на събитията, като най-голямата разлика е в характера и съдбата на съпругата му Милдред. ”Мемоарите” са суховати и напомпани с приповдигнат патриотизъм и клишета, което обаче стои правдоподобно, от “устата” на свръхбогат финансист и “филантроп”. Дали е благодетел или мошеник е въпрос пред читателя, защото има и много други податки за личността на Бевъл. Може би той е най-обикновен измамник и мръсник, може би пък е математически гений и брилянтен финансист и виртуоз на финансовите борси, който играе срещу пазара и така се обогатява неимоверно. Но за чия сметка и как точно? Третата част е в съвсем различен стил, защото съдържа спомените на Айда Партенза, писател и журналист с италиански корени. Баща и е работник-анархист с радикални в��згледи, който възпитава у нея едновременно възмущение и негодувание към света на свръхбогатите, но в същото време, може би без той да го желае, също така интерес и някакво благоговение към затворения им свят, където тя получава достъп. Айда е всъщност писателят-призрак, истинският автор на “автобиографията” на Андрю Бевъл. След многобройни срещи с финансиста, множество изчетени томове с мемоари на влиятелни американци, тя успява да му изгради консистентен “глас”, който той да одобри и приеме за свой, до степен да се слее със създадената от Айда версия за него и дори да и разкаже като свои измислени от нея “спомени”. Основната цел на Бевъл с тази “автобиография” е да изтрие гласа на Харолд Ванър и романа му “Връзки”, който е в конфликт с версията на Бевъл за действителността. В последната част можем най-сетне да чуем гласа на Милдред Бевъл чрез нейния дневник, който обаче е силно фрагментарен и на места разкъсан, така че е трудно да бъде дешифриран. Проблем представляват и силно нечетливият и почерк, а също навикът и често да използва акроними и съкращения. Резултатът е заплетен пъзъл, главоблъсканица, от която някои догадки се потвърждават и изясняват, но много повече навярно се заплитат поне за мен. През цялото време, докато четях, се питах коя е Милдред/Хелън, исках да видя, да разгадая тази жена, да я усетя, така както се опитва да го направи и Айда Партенза като преравя архиви и спомените си от разговорите с Бевъл. И все пак Милдред ми убягва над слоевете разкази за нея с взаимно противоречащи си варианти. На кого ще повярваме, на един мултимилиардер, който може да направи така все едно определен човек и написаното от него никога не са съществували, който може да изфабрикува нова реалност, да модифицира и фалшифицира? А можем ли да се доверим на Ванър и неговия роман? Но кой е той преди всичко? Щом никой и никога вече не го споменава, можем ли да докажем, че е съществувал? И какви са мотивите му да напише роман за истински лица, съдържащ толкова различна интерпретация на събитията? И най-важното за мен, коя е Милдред? Искала ли е някога да каже истината за себе си или всъщност е пожелала да се скрие? Може би пък целта и е била да отмъсти на съпруга си, да го поуплаши, да го разтърси или да изяви свободно себе си, нещо толкова трудно с изключително мощен финансово мъж до себе си. Романът поставя голям брой въпроси: за автентичността и многобройните интерпретации на едни и същи събития в зависимост от гледната точка и материалните и други интереси на участващите в него, за това на кого ще повярваме, на кого ще се доверим. Разбира се, изследва и природата на богатството и как то може да бъде ползвано, за тънката линия между благотворителност и разруха, за гениалността и морала или липсата на такъв. И накрая, според мен “Богатство” е роман за една голяма човешка трагедия, скрита зад изящни мебели, прекрасна музика и уникални мебели. Можеш ли да останеш себе си, да останеш човечен в златна клетка?И когато романът на Ванър е изчезнал, “автобиографията” на Бевъл е недовършена и неиздадена и само един-единствен човек знае, че тя е съществувала, когато дневникът на Милдред е така нечетлив и разкъсан, какво остава от действителността? Може би Айда Партенза, единствената, която знае нещо, но не всичко, ще напише роман, може би тя е написала “Богатство”? А може би нищо няма да остане, нито следа. Толкова много догадки и метафикция сигурно ще си кажете. Според някои Ернан Диас не се справил. Аз пък мисля, че се е справил с такава трудна тема и с толкова експериментална форма. Защото богатството съществува ли реално или както казва Гордън Геко от знаменития и пророчески филм “Уолстрийт”: “Парите не съществуват, те само преминават от едно измерение в друго.”. Какво предизвиква Голямата депресия, дали индивидуалните действия на наколко ултра богати индивиди или множество неизчислими фактори?По време на изпитите и интервютата в “Бевъл Инвестмънс” за първи път научих нещо, което имах възможност да потвърдя много пъти приз живота си: колкото по-близо си до източника на власт, толкова по-тихо става. Авторитетът и парите се ограждат с тишина и мащабите на влияние на човек могат да се мерят по гъстотата на мълчанието, с което той се обгръща”."
204,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16429676-l-ann,Rating 3 out of 5,"Not bad! I'm impressed by Mr. Diaz's ability to tell a story in such an unconventional way, yet maintain the ability to make it feel sophisticated, smart, acessible, and, most importantly, interesting. The book is divided into four sections. The first, Bonds by Harold Vanner, is a novel (within a novel 🙃) about a financier named Benjamin Rask and his wife, Helen. This was my favorite section of the book. I was immediately drawn to Benjamin and Helen, finding their personalities and relationship fascinating. Even though the ending was somewhat sad, I still thought it was beautifully written and a great way to start the story.The second part is an unfinished autobiography by Andrew Bevel intitled My Life. We quickly learn that Andrew Bevel is the real ""Benjamin Rask,"" and his account of his life contradicts quite a bit with what was presented in Bonds.The third part A memoir, Remebered is written by Ida Partenza, a woman who worked for Andrew shortly after the publication of Bonds and is tasked with helping him write his autobiography. Though her memoir wasn't as engrossing as the novel, it was still the most interesting of all the sections mainly due to the ideas of Ida's father, who is an anarchist. I like that he presents a counterpoint to Andrew's ideals on capitalism and finance. It's in this section that we are finally given a glimpse of who Andrew is through someone else's POV and his strange behavior regarding Mildred's characterization for future generations. The last section, Futures, is a collection of diary entries by Mildred Bevel. It is from these entries that we finally get a full understanding of who Andrew and Mildred really were, what type of relationship they had, and the secret behind their ability to amass their vast fortune. I felt like the ""great reveal"" was a bit underwhelming, but the journey to get to that point was worth it. I'm gonna rate this 3.5 stars, rounded down, but I have a feeling that this is one of those books that gets better the longer you sit on it, so my rating may go up in the future."

La novela es la construcción de la historia de la historia de la historia (e incluso la cuarta historia final a modo de coda).Son cuatro partes: La novela sobre Benjamin Rask y su esposa (la parte que más me ha gustado), el relato resumido, esquemático, taxonómico de Andrew Bevel (considero que es una parte del libro que podría haberse explotado más, el lector –tengo la sensación que pasa un poco de puntillas--), la historia de la escritora de la biografía de Bevel, Ida Partenza y por último el diario íntimo de Mildred Bevel, donde se nos presenta la verdad de Andrew. Dos personajes literario y sus contrapartidas (o contrarrelatos) metaliterarios: Andrew Bevel a Benjamin Rask; Mildred Bevel a Helen Rask.Un juego de espejos, un mapa sin territorio, una ruta hacia el interior de la novela.

En mi opinión, lo consigue y lo hace con mucha habilidad, jugando un poco con el lector para que no dé por cierto nada de lo que lea. Sin embargo, no consiguió emocionarme o maravillarme, me ha resultado un ejercicio intelectual acertado pero que me dejó algo fría. Por eso no le cae la quinta estrella. Quizá revise mi opinión si dentro de un año sigo pensando en esta obra."

When we first wake up in the morning we trade rest for profit. When we go to bed at night we give up potentially profitable hours to renew our strength. And throughout our day we engage in countless transactions. Each time we find a way to minimize our effort and increase our gain we are making a business deal, even if it is with ourselves. These negotiations are so ingrained in our routine that they are barely noticeable. But the truth is our existence revolves around profit""Trust (now longlisted for the 2022 Booker Prize) is split into 4 distinct but interconnected books: Bonds (written by Harold Vanner), which is loosely based on a Wall Street tycoon, Benjamin Rask, and his wife Helen Rask, both of which remained the wealthiest person in America even after the Wall Street Crash of 1929; My Life (written by Andrew Bevel) is Andrew Bevel's unfinished memoir, whereby he is a successful investor in New York and we learned that Benjamin Rask (the character from Bonds, the first book) is written based on Andrew Bevel; A Memoir, Remembered (written by Ida Partenza) is Ida Partenza's memoir, whom we learned that she is apparently the typist who is responsible for writing My Life (the second book) and her curiosity led her to investigate what really happened to Andrew's intelligent wife, Mildred Bevel, who purportedly suffered from mental illness; Futures (written by Mildred Bevel from the Swiss sanitorium) is Mildred's diary, which is discovered by Ida and we understand more on the dynamics and relationship between Andrew and Mildred and what really made Andrew successful even during the financial crisis in Wall Street. At the outset, Trust revolves around themes such as power, money, wealth, economy, and finance. There are brilliant discussions on dichotomies between notions such as Marxism, capitalism, industrialism, the relationship between finance capital and social injustice, and the blurred lines between the realms of fiction and finance. However, to me, the brilliance of this novel lies not in these themes, but in the structure and form of the same. With the use of 4 interconnected narratives, and perhaps the tool of ""story within a story"", Diaz managed to create a mysterious atmosphere surrounding the truth behind Mildred's death, the cause of Andrew's wealth, and the veracity of what was written by Harold Vanner in Bonds (the first book). This is what makes Trust a page-turner. Diaz's ability as a writer shines when he is able to accord 4 distinct voices by using 4 different writing styles to flesh out his characters in this book. In fact, through Trust, Diaz questions the reality that was presented to us when this world is dominated by the wealthy and the powerful who have the ability ""to bend and align reality"". Can we then really trust the reality, which is merely a public facade? As rightly put by Diaz, ""Reality is a fiction with an unlimited budget"". Trust is a 5/5 star read, it is experimental, unique in form, and an interesting puzzle ready to be solved by its readers!"
211,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60988553-susantalksbooks,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a book by an important and well regarded author. Hernan Diaz has won or been long or short-listed for most major literary awards, including for this book (the Booker Award). So the book is a must-read for literary fiction readers. But it is a mind-bender. Is it about the stock market? Is it about women's rights (or misogyny)? Is it historical fiction? Is there a hidden story/agenda? Yes to all. Unfortunately, reviews on GR are very mixed for this novel and you won't know if you are in the 'like' or 'dislike' camp until you get to at least 50-60% through the book. Just reading 10/20/30% won't cut it because it changes perspectives, time frame and message so dramatically your take won't be accurate.Divided into 4 parts, in part 1, ""Bonds,"" you will *think* you are reading a historical novel about Wall Street in the early 20th century and the couple at the center of it all, Benjamin and Helen Rask. But then we go into part 2, ""My Life"" and will try to understand if this is Benjamin's writing or someone else's? And what about the odd notes like it is a work in progress. I actually wondered if I had a kindle edition with mistakes! Then, finally, we get to Ida Partenza's memoir and one thread of the core of the story comes out. I loved Ida's story - she is smart, resourceful, dedicated, daring.  I truly want a whole book based on Ida. Ida shows us the inherent misogyny of the era (has it really changed much?), even with her loving father. We are introduced to a slightly different version of the realities we read about in parts 1 and 2. It is captivating. And finally, the big crescendo: Mildred Bevel's story, ""Futures,"" to complete the novel. This was a fast section with a reveal that may or may not surprise the reader. Suffice to say, Mildred is brilliant. A savant, really.My take is that this is a book about misogyny, and the 2 women - Ida and Mildred - are the absolute stars of the show. I want entire books written about them. Don't give up until at least 55%! 4-stars (-1 because it was a little rough getting to that 55%)."
212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137844555-dragons-4ever,Rating 3 out of 5,"Trust is a novel divided into four parts, each narrating a story that lacks clarity on the surface, much like a blurry mirror; one in which the truth is found in the cracks.  Bonds a novel by Harold Vanner ""Since the early day of their courtship, they had admired each other's intelligence and, above that, their mutual ability to understand the silences and empty spaces on which both of them thrived."" Bonds was a novel inside of this novel, a story based on much truth. During the economic collapse, Benjamin Rask thrived due to his wealth and well-timed investments. At a time such as this, accusatory rumors are thrown his way, demanding to know if he predicted this collapse or helped contribute to its cause. Helen is a woman whose brilliance is superior to many. At a young age, she dreamed of being independent and escaping the madness of her father. There is an assurance in both perspectives, and a thread of doubt is woven into both perspectives.      ""He wove intricate conjectures around her, threaded with contrived casual links that quickly expanded into vast nets of suppositions, which he would unspin and weave again in different patterns.""     In this marriage, she found someone who understood her words, her dreams, and her silences. She tried hard to fulfil her duty as a loving wife, but her love for him could never be of a romantic nature. As Helen suffers because of her mental illness, the clarity of her mind blurs as dreams and words tie knots in her head. The story transitions to only having one perspective: Benjamin Rasks. This was an intentional and important choice. The reader sees Helen's madness through Benjamin's perspective. There is a layered experience when reading: seeing Benjamin's clear conscience and ""good intentions,"" but digging deeper into the nuances of Helen's reactions and actions and seeing what really lies within. ""Most of us prefer to believe we are the active subjects of our victories but only the passive objects of our defeats.""   Sometimes certain things aren't meant to be fixed or cured. Sometimes mental illness is something that cannot be cured. It certainly can't when someone takes over your life and you're a fragment of yourself living in their shadow. Helen's right to make decisions is stripped from her, as is her right to have a choice. The person responsible for this is Benjamin, a man who drove her to her limit in his attempt to ""fix her."" ""Helen turned to him. Her face was a desolate ruin. A thing broken and abandoned, exhausted of being. Her eyes did not look at Benjamin but seemed to be only so that he could peer into the rubble within. He leaned over, kissed her scorched forehead, and told her she had been so brave and done so well. He hoped he was smiling."" My Life by Andrew Bevel  Andrew Bevel is the true Benjamin Rask, the man about whom Bonds was written about. In Bonds, there is both truth and lies, fiction and secrets. Andrew Bevel's story mirrors that of Benjamin Rask. Andrew Bevel loves Mildred, but it was hard to really see him love Mildred for who she was, but more for what she had to offer. This story is one that maintains a distance between the narrator and reader; it always felt as if I was a viewer and not there with the characters. This was not necessarily a bad thing because I was able to observe the story critically the whole time and not get heavily influenced by one character's perspective.         It's interesting to see how he loved his wife but found it hard to accept that her ideas and brilliance were beginning to eclipse his own. A Memoir, Remembered by Ida Partenza ""And perhaps, more importantly, these women showed me I did not have to conform to the stereotypical notions of the feminine world. Their stories were not just about romance and domestic bliss. There was violence in their books—a violence they controlled. These writers showed me, through their example, that I could write something dangerous. They showed me that there was no reward in being reliable or obedient: the reader's expectations and demands were there to be intentionally confounded and subverted.""    Ida Partenza was an interesting protagonist who encountered Andrew Bevel. What first appeared to be a new opportunity becomes a burden. By writing this memoir, Andrew wanted to uphold his reputation and the image he had crafted for his wife. He didn't want others to know that Mildred ended up helping him reach success and that her brilliance was behind several of his achievements. He didn't want others to see her as a woman turned raving man, insane, and unhinged. Ida searches to know the true Mildred, not the story that Andrew forces her to write—one crafted to hide the truth from the public. ""Later, over the years, both at work and both in my personal life, I have had countless men repeat my ideas back to me as if they were theirs—as if I would not remember having come up with those thoughts in the first place.""          Ida has many secrets. Her father is in danger of being deported. She writes a memoir for a man she once respected only to feel indifferent. As mentioned in the book, it shows how money can bend and warp perspective and morals. Ida wants to portray the true Mildred, not the one she wrote to be demure, kind, and flawless. Futures by Mildred Bevel  The last section of the story truly showcases Hernan Diaz's versatile writing style.  Contrary to his detailed and flowing writing style, Mildred's diary was written in staggering steps. Unfinished sentences, fragments, and words Seeing it from her perspective is interesting because there is a duality. Mildred feels desensitized to the passage of time, yet there is a fear, a shock, and a will to hold on to something within her. Honestly, such a beautiful section I would have loved to know what she was like before she met Andrew, because throughout the story we mostly saw her through the perspectives of others, and maybe the reader will never know the truth of how Mildred was before. ☑️PLOT☑️CHARACTERS"
213,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4167011-bert-hirsch,Rating 4 out of 5,"An enjoyable novel about the fictional financier Andrew Bevel who flourished in the early 1900s through the Great Depression. His story is told in 3 parts by himself, a novelist and his secretary. It focuses on his own rise in both anticipating and manipulating the financial markets to his own great benefit. A lonely character who may be best described as being on the spectrum of social awkwardness Bevel marries a young bright woman who is promoted by her striving mother and damaged by her father's mental illness.Diaz has well researched New York City society at the turn of the 20th century and anticipating his critics writes:""the book is entirely derivative...the undeniable influence of Henry James, Constance Fenimore Woolson, Amanda Gibbons and Edith Wharton...a mere succes de scandale that had gained notoriety only for being an obvious roman a clef.""In addition to channeling these earlier New York novelists, Diaz clearly researched the lives of early financial titans , whether it be Carnegie, Morgan, or others and details nicely the moves of the market and the high society of Manhattan in those years.A favorite character is the secretary he hires to assist in ghost writing a book about his deceased wife, Mildred. Ida Partenza is the daughter of a committed Italian American anarchist who regularly commemorates Bakunin's birthday, the fall of the Bastille, May Day and each August 23 when Sacco and Vanzetti were executed. The contrasting class struggle Ida represents offers interesting plot twists and humor.This is a well structured, well written novel that best captures these aspects of American History. Interestingly I found Hernan Diaz's prior novel, In The Distance, a more engaging inventive tale; it too touches on another aspect of American history- the Gold Rush and taming the West in the 1800s.I expect that Diaz has one or two more books coming that will further portray the American experience as it plays out in the United States."
214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58891395-deborah,Rating 4 out of 5,"I found the author’s debut novel, In the Distance, so dazzling that this sophomore effort was a bit of a letdown, but still worthy. It’s a book in four parts—a novella (within the novel), an incomplete autobiography, a memoir, and a journal—each in a different voice and each successively peeling back layers to reveal the essential truth at the heart of the story. We are looking at America’s wealthiest man, who started out a child of privilege but took his inheritance and turned it into a fabulous hoard beyond the dreams of avarice, hands always firmly on the levers of capitalism—or were they? In any event, the novella in part one is a thinly disguised story of the man and his wife, written in the 30s, after he successfully rode the great market crash of 1929 into even further riches. In the second part of the book, the incomplete autobiography, we hear the voice of the great man himself, and the tone is defensive and bombastic, insisting that his manipulation of the mighty strings of capitalism was for the common good and such like hooey, and includes some very sentimental observations about his wife that really almost obscure her as a person. (And incidentally, he includes an account of how he mercilessly crushed the novelist who wrote the novella in part 1 for having the temerity to write about him and his wife.) Part 3 is a memoir written decades after the fact by the poor young woman who was the great man’s amanuensis while he was writing his autobiography. The final slim section is a journal written by the great man’s wife—aha! Finally, we have the truth at the heart of it all. I found the construct intriguing, but while each of the four parts informed the others, they were essentially disparate. To me, it lacked the forward momentum of a cohesive story. It was a bit too “puzzle box” for my taste."
215,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11161028-kim,Rating 3 out of 5,"The book is a novel in four parts and 'told' by four different characters: The first part of the book comprises a 'novel' called 'Bonds' by Harold Banner about the rise to fame of a New York financier, Benjamin Rask - his history, career, marriage and widowhood, including his actions during the great Wall Street collapse of 1929, which led to him becoming a very wealthy man;The second part of the book, called 'My Life' by Andrew Bevel - this is an autobiography of a New York financier, which fairly closely parallels the novel in the first part but is incomplete, some parts being bullet points or notes;The third part, a memoir penned by Ida Partenza, brings some clarity. Ida tells of her employment in her twenties in 1938 as secretary to Andrew Bevel, when she is working directly with the financier to assist him in writing his biography, and also tells of her research into Andrew Bevel's wife when she has just turned 70 and the former Bevel mansion has been turned into a museum, complete with a full collection of the couple's letters and documents;The final part features a diary written by Andrew Bevel's wife, which Ida discovers hidden amongst the papers at the museum - this casts a different perspective on all that has gone before but sadly ends quite suddenly.Overall, I thought this was a good read rather than a great one. The characters didn't really come to life for me and, although the developments in the financial markets in the late 19th and early 20th century were well-described and of some interest, it's not really a subject area that appeals to me. Still rated it 3* - 7/10."

Както вече сте разбрали, в “Богатство” Ернан Диас използва четири различни похвата, за да разкаже една история – първо като художествена литература, която променя и доукрасява реалността за драматичен ефект, сетне като лична изповед, в която субективното надделява изцяло в напрегнато дирене на правилни спомени, последвани от драматично-хумористичен билдунгс разказ за жена, която изгражда себе си и характера си пред очите на читателя, и накрая разкъсан в кратки бележки дневник, който на свой ред разкъсва изцяло първите две части и ги прави на пух и прах. Има определен чар в този тип разказване – пълен отказ от линейност, изследване на идеите от различни посоки и през разказвачи, на които изобщо не може да се вярва, търсене на твърда земя там, където сякаш има само въздушни кули: психологията на самоподхранващото се свръхбогатсво, на игрите на власт, зад които се крият милиони подчинени им съдби. Макар да не съм почитател на такъв тип модернистични похвати, мога да оценя това, което е написал Диас, както и да призная, че ме изненада интересното и крайно неочаквано феминистично звучене на книгата му.

The first part is an excerpt from a 1938 novel by Harold Vanner who is telling a fictionalized account of a legendary Wall Street tycoon and his reclusive wife. The second part is an unfinished autobiography from Andrew Bevel, the thinly disguised subject of said novel. The third is an autobiographical essay written by Ida Partenza, the financier’s ghost writer. And the final section is taken from the diaries of Mildred Bevel, the financier’s wife. Each section reveals new information and calls to question the inaccuracies of the preceding sections. Basically, it is an elegant puzzle that repeatedly causes the reader to decide what information to trust (note the double entendre of the title).I absolutely adored this book! I admit, the subject matter of this book – financial markets, stock market crashes, Wall Street – made me pause. I was not entirely certain that this would be a book for me. But I kept seeing it getting rave reviews from readers with similar taste to my own and I decided to give it a shot. Then it was announced as a Booker Prize longlist contender, and I reread it.

I'm not sure I ever before thought about this question in such direct terms, but that's the underlying premise of this remarkable novel by Hernan Diaz, which won the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Literature (shared with ""Demon Copperhead,"" by Barbara Kingsolver) and longlisted for the 2023 Booker Prize.Set in the 1920s and 1930s in New York City, this is the story of (fictional) tycoon Andrew Bevel, a man who accomplished the most amazing financial feat: He beat the market just before October 1929, turning his stocks and bonds into cash weeks before the crash that led to the Great Depression. He spent his entire adult life beating the market, figuring out nuances and tricks to always come out on top—nuances and tricks that no one else could copy. But he is a cold, uncaring man who avoids society, has no real friends, and who is only made more human when he marries Mildred. This is not only a novel about Andrew Bevel's life and work, but also it's a novel about money—the ways it serves, benefits, and corrupts. The book, which is described as a literary puzzle, is written in four distinct parts:1. ""Bonds,"" a novel by Harold Vanner that not only ruthlessly tells the story of Bevel and his wife (using different names), alleging that Bevel's wife went insane and he had a role in her death, but also reveals the secrets of how Bevel accumulated his money.2. ""My Life,"" the rough first draft of an unfinished and unpublished memoir by Andrew Bevel that sets the record straight after Vanner's hateful, hurtful, and fabricated novel.3. In ""A Memoir, Remembered,"" Ida Partenza, Bevel's private secretary who was the ghost writer for his memoir, writes her own memoir of that experience 50 years later.4. ""Futures,"" by Mildred Bevel, Andrew's wife, who finally gets to tell her side of the story after being maligned by Vanner and sugar-coated as a quiet aesthete by her husband. In this diary that she kept in the last weeks of her life she makes a big confession…one that would horrify her husband if it were ever made public.Which one of these is the truth? Which one should the reader trust? All four pieces and parts have one thing in common: They focus on the meaning of family, the untold power and pain of extraordinary wealth, the moral devastation of greed, and the ultimate price of unfettered ambition. This masterfully written book is highly imaginative and creative with a multilayered plot that I found riveting. But it's so much more than that as it expounds ever so stealthily on all the things money can do—from benefiting those who need it most to corrupting one's very soul. And when it comes to telling our stories and reading about others, who is telling the truth? Is the truth the persona revealed to the public? Or is the truth the story only you can tell about yourself? Who would you trust to tell your story?"
241,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106214741-avi-baranes,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about this book. There are parts that are truly fantastic and make it clear why it won the Pulitzer. Then there are stretches that are incredibly dry - largely during the first part of the book (""Bonds""). I think there are two groups of people who would enjoy this: those interested in political economy (as this is a key part of the book) and storytellers/authors (for the incredible storytelling and structure of the book).The novel is told as four stories, with a bit of a ""Rashomon"" effect going on. The first is a fictional novel about a financier and his wife who built an empire and maintained it through the Depression. The financier is portrayed as a loner and his wife has a mental breakdown, causing her to be sent to an asylum where she receives controversial treatment (approved by her husband) and passes away. This part of the book is horrendously dry and was a slog to get through.The second part of the book is the autobiography of the person the fictional financier was based on. While it is incomplete (we learn why in the third act), it is clear that the financier took great offense to the novel and the way he and his wife were portrayed. He sees himself as a great man, parroting the prosperity doctrine, rugged individualism, and the Randian views on individual selfishness leading to common good. We also learn about the true and deep admiration and love he felt for his late wife, which was not the case in ""Bonds"".The third story is the memoir of the ghostwriter of the autobiography. She tells her story of growing up in near-poverty with a radical father (who, despite his failings, does love her more than anything) and a boyfriend who takes advantage of her good nature. She discussed meeting with the financier and taking notes on his life to write the autobiography. It's a phenomenal section of the book, as we learn that a) the financier didn't really know his wife, making up stories about her to put in his autobiography and b) is really more interested in clearing his name from accusations that he caused the depression. It's a fantastic contrast to the autobiography that really demonstrates the importance of knowing who is telling the story and for what purpose. The final story is the journals of the financier's late wife, and they, too, are engrossing. We learn, truly, what her influence was on the financier and how much of his success was really because of her brilliance - brilliance that was kept hidden away due to her being a woman. Like all good Rashomon stories, the final act reframes everything in a new light and provides all the answers we were missing - including answers to questions we didn't know we had.Last thought: Diaz's ability to write four short stories about the same people, but find a unique voice for each story was excellent. It did feel like four distinct stories told by four separate people. As I said, anyone interested in political economy (both in the explicit discussions of the nature of money/finance and the implicit critique of society through class and gender lenses) or the intricacies of storytelling (who gets to tell it, how is it told, etc.) should read this book. Though do be prepared for dryness in long stretches."

I'm attempting to deconstruct the story in my head in some logical fashion. I think what I've learned about listening to audiobooks for stories like this, meaning expansive, covering several different storylines, etc., versus reading the words on a page, they tend to be less concrete in my mind than if I'd had the book in front of me, and could flip back and forth at will between the pages.The story is told in four distinct phases, the first is Bonds, and is about a man named Benjamin Rask, who's an incredibly talented financier in the stock market (think Midas touch). But - don't let this section fool you, and b/c I prefer to write spoiler free opinions of a book, that's all I'll say about THAT section. The second part, My Life, concerns a character Andrew Bevel, whose life seems to parallel Rask's as a financier. (As I was listening to the book, I thought, wait, is this guy a relative of Rask? No. Eventually, as you go along you figure out what Diaz has pulled on you.) Bevel is attempting to write his autobiography to get the record of his life straight to those interested in his business. He's unsuccessful, which leads to the third section, A Memoir, Remembered, and the eventual hiring of Ida Partenza. Before you get to the hiring part, you'll get to spend time with Ida who's a character I really enjoyed. She's twenty-three, has a loving, but strained relationship with her anarchist father, who's overbearing, and watching this relationship evolve was one of the best parts of the book. Because of what happens with them financially, she will eventually go through an interview process with Bevel that's odd - done to hide her employer's identity, given who he is.The last part was my favorite. It's about Bevel's wife, Mildred, in her voice. Before we hear from her as a character, I'd already guessed what her role was in this marriage. I mentally patted myself on the back for that - haha. A pretty unique read for me - I went into it without reading what it was about, but trusting it would be good because, hello, Pulitzer. Recommend for those who enjoy uniquely constructed novels with sections that don't seem to tie together, but do. Somehow."

I found great pleasure in watching how the book unfolds, and I believe too much information about it may spoil the experience of a reader. I highly recommend not reading too much about Trust beforehand - just start reading if you think it would appeal to you. Here are some details to give you a fairly broad overview. The novel is written in four major sections, as evident in the Table of Contents.Bonds: Harold VannerThe first section is a novel about Benjamin Rask, the son of Solomon, a wealthy tobacco trader who sells that business to become a general Wall Street securities trader. The story starts in the late 1800’s and continues into the early twentieth century.My Life: Andrew Bevel This section is written as a memoir of a financier, completed around 1938. He has been highly successful and wants to share his story with the reader.A Memoir Remembered: Ira PartenzaThis is the longest part of Trust, and follows the life of a woman who works for a wealthy financier during the Great Depression. She becomes a successful writer, and is remembering her early work.Futures: Mildred BevelThe final section and one best read fresh without much knowledge.For me, Trust was the best book I’ve read in some time. By GR’s ratings, some readers were not as taken by it as I was. I hope you’ll enjoy it as much as I did - trust me by not reading too much beforehand."

The narrator changes a few times, and at first, I was perturbed at what seemed to be an entirely new start; then, the last two narrators completely captivated me, and I couldn’t imagine the story being done any differently. This is a smart novel about capitalism, wealth, the stock market, misogyny, and family dynamics in the early 20th century. A few of the many passages that caught my attention:“God is the most uninteresting answer to the most interesting questions.”“For I’ve come to think one is truly married only when one is more committed to one’s vows than the person they refer to.”“Most of us prefer to believe we are the active subjects of our victories but only the passive objects of our defeats. We triumph, but it is not really we who fail - we are ruined by forces beyond our control.”"

The concept was very intriguing, it was the same story told in four different ways, each revealing more than the last. And while each style was different, I’m not sure they were all actually good, or at least there were some (notably the second) that didn’t add much to the story. The third and fourth parts were fantastic, but the first was just okay, and the second was not great at all. I’ll say 3.5 rounded down. "

I knew I was in trouble with Hernan Diaz's new Pulitzer winner Trust literally around page 5 or 10, when the narrator mentioned that the reason our book's protagonist (Gilded Age tycoon Benjamin Rask) enjoys investing because it allows him to have fun and accomplish his goals without having to worry about how his actions affect the ""little people"" he can't stand being around. That sent up a big signal flare that this was going to be an RPB novel, by which of course I mean a ""RICH PEOPLE BAD!!!"" novel, which I have to admit right away I can't stand. I mean, don't get me wrong, I agree that rich people are bad; but that's an insight any random five-year-old child can give me, and not something I would expect from a book that's just won the US's most prestigious literary award (or, well, in this case co-won it with Barbara Kingsolver's Demon Copperhead, which I'll be reading next). Unfortunately, though, that's the level of discourse we have in our country anymore, where the radical wings of both political parties have completely taken over our national culture by now, and so we literally now hear such cartoonish things in public as one side declaring, ""Slavery is bad!,"" mostly because the other side is so reactionary, they immediately respond with, ""No it's not! Slavery is good! Fuck you, snowflake! SLAVERY NOW, CUCK!!!""I acknowledge (even if I don't like it) that such troglodytes and mouth-breathers have completely hijacked the tattered remnants of what used to be called ""intellectual discourse"" in this country; but that's why I turn to literary fiction in these times, because that's supposed to be one of the few places left in the US where we can actually have nuanced, complex, sophisticated conversations about the issues affecting society in any given year. But man, if they're now giving out Pulitzers to ""RICH PEOPLE BAD!!!"" novels, we're all fucked, and surely a violent and protracted Civil War II (""This Time It's Personal"") is just around the corner. To be as fair as I can, at least Diaz attempts a clever structure to his RPB story, which I suspect is the main reason it won the Pulitzer; it's only the first quarter of the book that's written in the style of an Edith Wharton novel, supposedly published during the Great Depression, while part two is a section of an autobiography by the supposed real person behind this supposed fictional novel (the fictional-to-us but real-to-this-universe Andrew Bevel), talking about what a great guy he is and how the novel totally gets things wrong, while part three is a memoir by the woman hired to write that autobiography, revealing that Bevel's actually much more of a monster than either book makes it seem, while the concluding part four is an excerpt from the private journals of Bevel's wife, revealing that no, seriously, Bevel's a serious monster, I'm not kidding, because did I mention that RICH PEOPLE BAD???!!!!!1!That's clever, I admit, which is why I stuck in there with this book for as long as I did; but ultimately none of these four sections do anything but continue to make the RPB case over and over, with less and less subtlety with each passing page, until by the end we're watching Bevel cooking and eating puppies in front of their child owners while giving an evil cackle and asking for his special ketchup made out of human tears and blood (or at least presumably -- I didn't actually make it that far). That's simply not for me, and in an ideal world it wouldn't be for you either; but in a world that condemns billionaires in one breath and then in the very next breath makes Succession literally the most watched television show in the country, I'm not holding out hope that things will change anytime soon.

Sólo en ello. Me explico. La novela genera buenas sensaciones y es una buena novela, mejor que muchas de las que se van a publicar, pero -aquí viene el temible pero- se queda a mi entender en un mero deseo, no da en el busilis (perdonad la pedantería). Además, de lo que podríamos calificar como muy positivo como es el hecho de que juega mucho con el estilo finisecular de las grandes novelas, aquí se entrevé cierto presentismo. Quiero decir. La novela juega con reproducir a las grandes novelas, pero eso, en su caso, no la convierte en verosímil, porque ya se hizo y se hizo mejor. Hoy, retrotraerte a los últimos años del siglo XIX y principios del XX y olvidarse de la visión actual de ese pasado es muy difícil, y Hernán Díaz no lo consigue. Se percibe nítidamente su juego. Miramos al pasado con ojos posmodernos. Ciudadano Kane ya se rodó y nos la creímos, pero para contarnos algo (sin ser lo mismo) y que se convierta en unas crónicas fidedignas hay que, o haber nacido en esa época o ser muy ágil con la palabra. Igualmente, el hecho de componer el libro alrededor de una misma historia, contada desde diferentes ángulos y por varios personajes, la adelgaza de cierto músculo. Cuando empiezas a conocer los tejemanejes de los personajes, se trunca bruscamente. Se escribe punto y final y cambiamos de tercio de nuevo. Le falta chicha. Tiene tejido, piel, que ya es mucho más de lo que podemos decir de algunas obras que se publican en la actualidad, pero se queda ahí, en la dermis. Añado también, ciertas decisiones que se producen a lo largo de las tramas que son verdaderamente inverosímiles y otras, que se cierran de manera violenta sin explicación. La historia gira en torno a las vidas de un magnate de las finanzas y su mujer. Él quiere recontar su vida porque no le gusta lo que se dicen de ellos. Para ello solicita a una secretaria inexperta que tome notas y hagiografíe, más o menos, sus vidas. A mí ya me chirría esto. Que el hombre más potente de América y, posiblemente, del mundo, solicite los servicios no del mejor escritor del momento, sino de una aprendiza es algo cuestionable. Hernán, para mí, aquí te columpias. Poco más. A pesar de estas palabras, partía de unas expectativas altas -he leído hiperbólicas comparaciones con El gran Gatsby-, y, es verdad que la novela está bien, pero no da para más. Leedla y juzgad."
257,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23045553-david-peterson,Rating 5 out of 5,"Hernan Diaz ”Trust” handlar om förra seklets rikaste – kanske mest framgångsrika – man. Fyra olika berättelser, varav en självbiografi och en ”roman” i romanen, belyser huvudpersonen, som går under två olika namn, “romanens” Benjamin Rask och “verklighetens” Andrew Bevel. Det är den bästa bok jag läst i år. I del ett, den Gatsby-inspirerade “romanen” Bonds, målas Rask upp som ett udda geni, en Wall Streets Batman som förlorar sina rika föräldrarna ung för att sedan överträffa alla förväntningar, trots att Rask kommer från en ryktbar handelsfamilj. Jag fångas direkt av Rasks förmåga att se mönster och trender innan den övriga marknaden hunnit reagera. Han ser kriserna och möjligheterna de för med sig när alla andra tror på evig avkastning. I bakgrunden rör sig frun Helen, som anordnar konserter och stöttar konstnärer. Även Helen beskrivs som ett ungt geni men i jämförelse med Rasks bedrifter blir hennes filantropi och kulturinsatser löjligt små. Ändå blir man nyfiken på vilken roll hon egentligen spelar – särskilt då Rask skakas så djupt när hon går dåtidens klassiska kvinnoöde till mötes.Självbiografin, romanens andra del, blir Andrew Bevels verktyg för att lägga verkligheten på plats. Han är förbannad över bilden som målats upp i “romanen” och anlitar en ung italiensk sekreterare som spökskrivare. Bevels historia skiljer sig inte särskilt mycket från den som berättas i “romanen” Bonds, men han är noga med att spela ned Helen Rasks/Mildred Bevels geni. Hon var intelligent men ägnade sig främst åt hushållet och andra kvinnliga bestyr, säger han. Plötsligt handlar boken inte längre om den framgångsrika affärsmannen – frågan blir i stället: Vem var Mildred?Bitarna börjar falla på plats i bokens tredje del, där den italienska spökskrivaren Ida Partenza själv för pennan. Den briljanta mannen ifrågasätts allt mer. När Andrew kritiserar Idas text för att vara för mjäkig tar hon sig till stadsbiblioteket i New York och läser andra framgångsrika mäns självbiografier: bilmogulen Henry Fords, stålmagnat Andrew Carnegies, presidenten Calvin Coolidge och grundlagsfadern Benjamin Franklins. Hon förstår att Andrew vill framstå som de erkänt historiska männen. Bevel vill att det ska visas att hans handlingar påverkat världen.Kanske sammanfattas Rask/Bevels fundamentala inställning till sig själv bäst av författaren till “romanen” Harold Vanner: “Most of us prefer to believe we are the active subjects of our victories but only the passive objects of our defeats”.När berättelsens riktning tydliggörs blir jag irriterad över att läsaren skrivs på näsan, och över att slutet inte får ligga kvar i undertexten. The writings on the wall. Men när jag funderar mer tror jag att min ilska grundare sig i att bilden av den framgångsrika mannen så tydligt och effektivt ifrågasätts, muren rasar och den geniförklarade Andrew Bevel/Benjamin Rask visar sig inte vara annat än en osäker charlatan. Det finns något där, i den reaktion. Kanske handlar det om makten av att kunna spegla sig i det man känner igen."

I am almost finished with the second part and I am so bored I just can’t go on. Part one was dull and lifeless. I felt zero connection to any character. It reads like an encyclopedia. I’ve read other reviews that call it bloodless, devoid of warmth, life, and feeling. Then in part 2 we are subjected to a master of the universe humble bragging. The only grace of this section is that he doesn’t describe everything. His notes of what to expand on felt like a gift each time- I was spared the boring details. If reading a good book is like biting into a delicious perfectly made sandwich with thoughtfully stacked flavors and textures bursting in your mouth, reading this is like chewing on cardboard. I get that the structure is clever, but it doesn't stop it from being tedious.175 pages in and this is as emotionally anemic as a science textbook. Several reviews claim it gets better. And I will plod through the rest and complete this review. But I feel like I am reading this for an assignment. And since there is no due date, I will come back to it after girding my loins. OK, so I finished. I admit I skimmed much of it. My feelings can be best summed up in any of the one star reviews, but here were the highlights:On the unrevelatory reveal in part 4: ""People with money get to control the narrative!"" ""Women are treated like props for men!"" ""Behind every great man is a woman!""On how highly praised this book was: ""It struck me as the 'Springtime for Hitler' of books - one written deliberately badly but which has proved to be an odd success with critics""On part 4: ""I fully expected the novel would finally lift itself out of the mundane slog, and into something revelatory, and beautiful--but instead it just flopped around, like a fish drowning in air, and died.""I am so annoyed by how flat and tedious this was that I can't even be bothered to come up with my own words to explain my dismay that I didn't just chuck this in a bin rather than coming back and finishing it. Dreadfully boring. Instead of one star I award Trust 5 eye roll emojis. Beautiful cover though-LOL."

La grande genialata di questo romanzo è raccontare la storia di questo magnate americano che vive e si arricchisce nella prima metà del Novecento attraverso 4 differenti espedienti o tipi di narrazione. L'idea è sicuramente interessante, il problema è che, per essere interessata a leggere la storia di quest'uomo (e di sua moglie) per quattro volte, me ne sarebbe dovuto fregare qualcosa; il mio problema infatti nasce proprio qui: se tutto il romanzo ruota attorno alla figura ""enigmatica"" (ma doveee) di questo magnate, c'era bisogno necessariamente di creare un personaggio originale, o quantomeno intrigante; invece, calma piatta o almeno, nulla che non si sia già visto o sentito: vanesio, manipolatore, incapace di mantenere un rapporto umano che non sia disfunzionale o dominato dalle logiche di potere e così via. Non commento nemmeno la figura della moglie e le straordinarie rivelazioni a cui assistiamo nel corso delle varie fasi del romanzo perché hanno la stessa tensione narrativa del famoso segreto di Pulcinella. Un appunto anche allo stile di scrittura: l'ho trovato molto ""classico"", sarà stata sicuramente una scelta consapevole dell'autore dettata da esigenze narrative, ma non mi ha smosso assolutamente nulla. Ora, in conclusione a queste conclusioni sparse, mi sento di dire che un'idea interessante (ma di certo non nuova o rivoluzionaria) non può fare un grande romanzo, per me qui manca tutto il resto; ora, per mia fortuna (o sfortuna chissà) non sono una critica letteraria, quindi posso liberamente esprimere la mia opinione in base a quello che mi piace e mi emoziona ed è per questo che anche se probabilmente è un giudizio un po' severo, per me questo romanzo completamente asettico e che cerca di essere intelligente più di quello che è vale 1 stella."

Separated into four parts, the book is at once a novel, an autobiography, a memoir, and a journal. American financier Andrew Bevel has been lauded and despised as tycoon who made a fortune off the stock market crash of 1929. His life with his wife Mildred has been shrouded by mystery and myth over the last century. This book is four neatly interlocking attempts to tell their story. The first section is a novel ostensibly about the Bevels with the names changed. The following sections start to sift through what is truth and what is myth.I love a book with an interesting structure or concept. Books like “Cloud Atlas” or “Cloud Cuckoo Land” or “A Visit from the Goon Squad” with their interconnected stories. Different genres in one book always appeal to me as a kind of literary puzzle. This book provides the same satisfaction. The book is less plot and character driven, but the structure works well and I still found the book very readable. The telling of the lives of Andrew and Mildred evoke themes of trust (obv.), truth, the making of myth, and whose story it is to tell. While reading this book, I was in awe of the writing. Each section is so distinct with each narrator possessing a unique voice. It’s astonishing this all came from the same writer. I don’t want to say too much about the novel since the slow reveal of details makes this book fun and engaging. I love that this was centered around the early 20th century, now the source of myth in itself. This book evokes larger-than-life characters Citizen Kane and Jay Gatsby and The Magnificent Ambersons threaded with real life tycoons J.P. Morgan, Rockefeller, Carnegie. In then end the book questions history and legend in the myth making of American industry. Whose story do you trust?"

This semi-autobiographical debut had me scouring for westerns while anxiously awaiting the release announcement for his next novel, Trust. Far from a modern western, Diaz’s pen has drawn up a new uncharted gem-filled course in fictional storytelling. 𝘛𝘳𝘶𝘴𝘵 is structured in four parts: novel, manuscript, memoir and diary. Individual parts sound like easy bake oven recipe but I am in awe on how aspects are interlinked to create a memorable layered dish.Admittedly, the starting novel 𝘉𝘰𝘯𝘥𝘴 was a tedious chore. I kept replaying the adventure-charged character development from the debut and asking myself—why in the world did Diaz give us a third-person narrative of miserable elitist to follow as they take advantage of financial markets. But pages into the personal manuscript followed into the memoir, it clicks! Similar to 𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘋𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘭 𝘏𝘰𝘶𝘴𝘦 by John Darnielle, Diaz blurs the narrative perception of reality in all the best ways!For a book set in the Edith Wharton’s gilded age, I found Mildred to be the missing dynamic female voice who is not driven solely by the purpose of marriage. Elements of capital markets are discussed in approachable terms without it seemingly like a stock trading floor jargon. There are also nuggets of literature references for the book lover. The prose is strange but purposeful. Diaz’s construct of wealth left me questioning my preference for history or fiction.A huge thank you to Riverhead Books for my first printed arc copy of my most anticipated release!"

I just couldn’t pick up the writing style - maybe my dyslexia kicking in - either way it took a lot of concentration and really took the joy out of it for me, particularly at the beginning. Suddenly chapter 3 turned things around for me and encouraged me to keep reading and so this is where it all started to get interesting…The structure of this book confused me - was I meant to be confused? Idk but it was split into 4 parts which were somehow all connected by one or two characters but yet they read so differently. Ida’s section of the story was definitely my favourite! I appreciated the various styles of writing despite the confusing structure; it kept it interesting and along with the short chapters it felt much more readable. I didn’t like many of the characters at the beginning but I did begin to feel for the characters Helen and Mildred; I felt connected with their need for solitude and love of literature, unfortunately I didn’t feel much connection to any of the other characters. That is until Ida came along, finding herself in the midst of the task of turning Mildred Bevel’s ghost into a tangible human being. Ida showed intelligence and courage whilst also sharing the delights of literature and arts with Helen and Mildred. From the beginning I felt there was a sadness about the book. There were little joyous moments, but dominated more by solemn situations. I am left torn as to my thoughts on this book…I wouldn’t say I enjoyed it but it did leave an impact which I can appreciate. I’m not exactly sure what the point of it all was and feel like much of the financial aspect was lost on me. "

I generally find Wall Street talk boring, but my eye kept coming back to this book, and I am so glad that I gave it a chance. Hernan Diaz crafted the perfect classic American novel. This book could stand next to The Great Gatsby and not feel out of place in language or character development. This is the example to give people when they want to recreate a classic. Don't take the same story and rework it, write in the same feel as a classic. The intricate web of mystery Diaz crafted was genius. How well do we know someone? How well can anyone know a celebrity or tycoon? How would someone like Jeff Bezos describe himself and how close would his description come to reality? This is what Diaz works toward in his narrative against narrative against narrative against narrative. Will we ever know the full truth about a person, even if we read their own words? Along with the labyrinth of narrative, Diaz also weaves in the history of Wall Street in the 1920's, culminating in the crash of '29. Normally, I would want to skip that history but this book was intriguing from start to finish. I had to know all the details, and how one person could move a market to its greatest highs and its lowest lows.This is a book that you will not want to miss. History fans, and especially classic fans will want to snatch this book up. "

This three part novel was a good story and I admire the ambition behind it but it was too confusing for me to get the most out of it. The first part tells the story of a fictional financier, Benjamin Rask and his wife Helen. Both are intelligent and reclusive. Benjamin is blamed for the stock market crash that led to the Great Depression and Helen is mentally ill. Only later do we find out that this fictional account is a thin veil for the true story of Andrew Bevel and his wife Mildred. Since we are not told this, part two seems to be an attempt by a similar financier to write his autobiography. This account had so many gaps that I thought Diaz was writing notes to himself. For example he writes, “More examples of his business acumen” and “show his pioneering spirit”. Only in the final third where Ida Partenza is hired to write a biography of Andrew Bevel does it become clear that Benjamin Rask is Andrew Bevel and Mildred Bevel is Helen Rask. Bevel has Partenza bend the truth to make Andrew appear more competent than he is and reduce Mildred in intelligence and accomplishments by comparison. It’s an interesting plot device but it was unsatisfying to me in that for 2/3 of the book I did not understand what I was reading.I look forward to meeting this author at Booktopia 2022."

So one learns plenty about the nature of capitalists as they portray themselves. This book could have been the literary dream of one of the students of the great sociologist C. Wright Mills. And yet you never forget that you are in the middle of a created world, fiction. The second subject, as I read it, is illusion. Or rather, the stories we tell ourselves to justify our lives. If, by the end, I did not know what the novel amounted to, I still retained a towering respect for Diaz's play with form, with his intimate knowledge of capitalism, and with intricate ease in creating full characters with multiple dimensions. No doubt we are in the hands of a master.I don't think we have yet seen Diaz's full flowering. Watch out! Its coming."

Lots of meta aspects concerning the relationship between author and reader, how the reader interprets and carries forward meaning, how the stories we tell are wielded as both sword and shield. Reminded me of Cloud Cuckoo Atlas in the exploration of those themes and asking big questions about how and why we tell stories, and who gets to tell them. Also majorly interesting for how it uses myriad types of fiction/written instruments to show a modern audience how America's economy from the 1920s/black Thursday led to and still has so many echoes in our current time of great wealth disparity (for instance, Bevel buying and burying Bonds in every possible way is a clear antecedent to billionaires buying local newspapers or controlling forms of media). Extra extra points for the juicy characters of Helen/Mildred and Ida (Ida Prentice = ""I'd apprentice"") and all the ways they embody ideas about ideology, women's choices, women's health, the arts, commerce, and morality, as each takes turns acting the author and the subject. For those readers complaining Andrew Bevel isn't interesting enough to sustain the book - he's not the book's ultimate subject. He's basically Mr. Burns. Mildred is the subject and a fascinating one at that. Was it a lady who ultimately kind of did the bad, bad thing?? Eat your heart out, Edith Wharton!!"
272,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow! Now I get why everyone was calling this the best book of 2022. It starts off pretty tame as a historical fiction book about a financier (imagine Elon Musk but in the 1920s). The first hundred pages or so do have some financial jargon, so having some financial math knowledge definitely helped there. But that novel was only the first part of the book. From there, Trust included three other sections (notes from an unfinished autobiography, a different memoir, and diary entries). Each one of these stories slowly unravels what is initially perceived to be as ""the truth"". The title of Trust had a bit of a double meaning in that it refers to both a trust in the business sense and the action of trust between two people. The story shows how what we perceive to be the truth is often inverted and dominated by money (which still seems relevant today). The book itself follows a unique format, where the truth isn't fully revealed until the ending pages. The book also had a lot of unique symbolism comparing the rise and fall of markets with palindromes, musical notes, interpersonal relationships, and storytelling. This was only the second book I've read (after Cloud Atlas) where I found myself turning back to prior chapters and re-reading sections before I even got to the end of the book!"

I listened to the audio to the end then went back and listened to the first section (about the fictional Rasks in the book Bonds) again. I recommend doing this. It really crystallizes the story. I really loved how Diaz parallels Andrew Bevel’s artificially inflated sense of self importance with the financial markets he claims to control. And how this warped sense of reality spills over into his relationship with his wife1/2 a star off for Bevel’s autobiographical section which felt a bit too tortured and affected. I understand what Diaz was trying to do but a little too much of the effort shown through. One of my favorite pieces of insightful storytelling:“Here was Bevel telling me my story to my face. Later over the years both at work and in my personal life, I’ve had countless men repeat my ideas back to me as if they were theirs, as if I would not remember coming up with those thoughts in the first place. It is possible that their vanity had eclipsed their memory so that thanks to this selective amnesia they could lay claim to their epiphany with a clean conscience. And even back then, in my youth, I was acquainted with this parasitic form of gaslighting.”"

So when you read your textbooks, ask yourself who is telling the story - and what they have to gain by your believing it"". Oh, this is so true for this book! Trust isn't necessarily breaking new ground with its themes of power, money, and gender, but these are addressed with an interesting narrative structure. There are four sections to this book, each adding a layer and illumination to the previous section and Diaz inhabits each of these voices so well. The book starts with a 1938 novel about a legendary Wall Street tycoon, Benjamin Rask. Rask is a thinly disguised character based on a legendary Wall Street tycoon who shows up in the next section attempting to set the record straight with his own memoir. Additional sections by his ghost writer and wife add to the story. I thought the idea was well executed and the writing was spot on. 4.5 stars."

Así funciona esta novela de Hernán Díaz: primero construye un estilo elegante y algo repipi a la manera de Edith Wharton y después va socavando la historia recién narrada a través de una serie de textos, cada cual con su estilo singular, que añaden lecturas contradictorias. Veo en las reseñas a gente decepcionada porque el final se haga previsible demasiado pronto, pero no creo que la gracia de este libro consista en desvelar ningún misterio insospechado, sino justamente en ver cómo funciona esta superposición de relatos, cuán volátil es la credibilidad de los discursos y la fluidez con la que estos circulan (sí, como el dinero, que está también en el centro de la trama). Tengo pendiente la anterior novela de Díaz, que no dejaré en espera mucho tiempo más, pero sobre todo aguardaré impaciente las restantes que vaya publicando."

Third part finally entertained me. And fourth part made the obvious final move. This is an entirely overrated novel, simply because, like with Trust Exercise, people overindulge authors who make bold structural choices. But, regardless of Diaz's structure, the thematic terrain is SO BLAND. Sorry, but how is anyone shocked that a man in finance may or may not be an ass and that capitalism sucks and that capitalism serves as the groundwork of the American mythos and thats stories cannot be trusted and that fiction and history can become interwoven and difficult to disambiguate and that women are erased from history (even when they actually do all the work their husbands supposedly do). PLEASE stop letting trite material be treated like the best novel of the year or, God forbid, a future classic, as I've seen some people say."

I really appreciated the formats the author used to convey the message that perception is everything and in a way, we create our own realities. The story is about the rise of a man who dominates Wall Street at the turn of the century and serves as a deep dive into his relationship with intriguing wife and his desire to tell his story the way he wants it told. We follow a generational account of how the man became successful, what that meant to those around him and ultimately who he really was through different biographical narratives and hearsay. I loved how strategic the author was in sharing just the right amount of information at the right time and how each account undermines the former. I was a bit bored with all of the financial aspects, but the story that was being told was a good one. 4 stars."

Though, in ""Trust"" I miss something - you may call it drive, or energy, or stuff that makes me emotional. The author's technique of using different POV is far from being new. The ending is predictable, still wonderfully written. Actually, it's the last part that demonstrates H.Diaz's skill and diversity. I like that the author doesn't follow the latest trends dictating a strong social, gender or race agenda. The novel sticks to a bit old-fashioned style, not crossing the borders of what one can expect of a novel written in that period.I 'm sure that the book deserves being long-listed for Booker and definitely is worth reading."

An article recently talks about how the bestsellers of this year are 11% shorter in length compared to the last. This is a staggering decline. Trust is a proof of this trend. The book could have been much better if it had escaped the latest fad.The story, as clear from the blurb, is fiendishly clever in its conception. It fails to fulfill the potential because of the hurtful brevity. The author could have done with an extra character or two and more surprises involving the lead couple. That said, this is a good read for the ambitious storyline and the author's stylistic experiments. "

The manner in which it was set up was it's only redemption because it made it manageable enough to actually finish the book, but sheesh it was boring. I actually enjoy math, but the first part (and several other sections of the book) was so filled up with financial terms and stock market ups and downs, it made my brain just shut down. I enjoy historical fiction but apparently not historical fiction that has to do with economics. There is a slight twist toward the end that makes you lift your eyebrows, but other than that it is just an unexciting book."

It’s a timely look at this county’s history with the financial markets. Really interesting.

The first two parts never settle into scene, but parts three and four, both from female perspectives, do and build to rebuke the first half of the book.

294,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33603612-chrissie,Rating 2 out of 5,"Sporting a distant and aloof midcentury tone, Diaz has penned a book with no narrative of its own, but rather simply containing four separate books and overlapping stories and characters. The basis of all four pieces lies in the foundation of Andrew and Mildred Bevel, renowned for their wealth in 1920s New York. Amid rumors of hidden secrets and financial maneuvers, their prominence wanes as the era of excess concludes. Trust, with a purposely double-meaning word circling around both money-related and truth-bound, opens with a 1938 novel named Bonds by Harold Vanner which tells the story of Benjamin and Helen Rask. Covering their rise to the upper echelon of New York society and wealth, Bonds follows from Benjamin's and Helen's childhoods, through their marriage, and their incredible investments that puts them on top following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. It's presented as a slightly stodgy and surprisingly bland presentation of a biography. Trust then proceeds with the second book, this time an unfinished memoir by Andrew Bevel titled My Life telling the story of his childhood and marriage to Mildred. Mapping out a strikingly similar tale from the fictional Bonds, Diaz has included marginalia and comments for items and sections to be worked out or added later. This one includes an almost over-the-top bombastic arrogance that tries really hard (on Diaz's part, not Bevel's) to ride the line between comically so or just tiresome.The next section is the longest, and is yet another memoir, aptly named, A Memoir by Ida Partenza, whom we discover to have been Andrew Bevel's private secretary assisting him in writing his own memoir, My Life. While this was the most fleshed out of the three, and the most seemingly interested in revealing the truth, it's hard to know (or care) if there is any more truth in this version of events than in the others. Ida's backstory and days working with Andrew Bevel were incredibly overstuffed, spilling over with an almost silly cardboard cutout of a father as a pseudo-anarchist version of Belle's tinkerer dad in Disney's Beauty and the Beast.And, bringing up the rear, Trust finishes up with another memoir-esque book — a diary, written by Mildred Bevel. Mildred has helpfully named this diary, Futures, which I found suspicious in the first place as far as whether it was any more or less truthful than the alternative account given by her husband, Andrew, in his own memoir, My Life. Getting going with this one was fairly easy, and I found that I didn't mind the first book, Bonds, per se. There was a humorous tone to it, intentional or not, I'm unsure. Now, there have been a lot of comparisons that Trust reminds readers of an Edith Wharton, and, aside from the level of society described, I don't see that. Instead, I was repeatedly, which I think was intentional during the second section (My Life), reminded of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead. Apart from that, there is, I believe, supposed to be a reveal or twist in the last section, Futures. If that's true, this was just a long journey to an inevitable conclusion that I saw coming from the moment a single word was dropped in the first section, Bonds. And if that is the case, I cannot even begin to understand the hype this one got — much less the accolades.The ways in which both Rask and Bevel acquired their wealth was believable enough, and was at least skimmed over so that it wasn't the focus of those sections. However, the oversimplification of the 1929 Crash was too distorted and fractured for me to find believable and chipped away my suspension of disbelief.This book (and major reviews) had me anticipating a surprising twist, a curveball that never arrived. It simply followed a well-worn track that was evident from the outset. While I don't believe every book must have a clear ""point"" or ""purpose,"" I'm left wondering about Diaz's intent behind writing it. If his aim was to convey what he managed to tease from his slender plot nestled within layers of stories-within-stories, I'm left uncertain about his message beyond the evident.Audiobook, as narrated by Edoardo Ballerini, Jonathan Davis, Mozhan Marnò, and Orlagh Cassidy: All four contributing performers did a great job. Honestly, I don't know if I would've finished this if had been much longer or if it hadn't been in audiobook format. The narrators were very good, which made it that much easier to listen while I did other things."

Идея си нямам какво съм очаквала, но комбинацията Пулицър и действие в Ню-Йорк в началото на миналия век ме привлече като магнит. Четох дълго книгата - в рамките почти на месец с много паузи. Първа част прочетох неусетно. Историята на Бенджамин и Хелън Раск ме увлече и исках да разбера повече за обърканите им и странни, бих казала студени и дистанцирано семейни отношения. ��лед това не знам какво стана, но повече от две седмици не посегнах към книгата. Други бяха привлекли вниманието ми и не ми се връщаше сякаш към нея. Докато в един момент не реших да опитам да я слушам в аудио формат и някак отново ми потръгна. Отне ми време да се усетя къде е основната врътка, защото не бях чела никакви ревюта и да си призная това беше доста хитро, защото така сама открих интересната композиция на романа, който реално представя една и съща история от 4 гледни точки. Определено много интригуващо. Супер добре прочетена история в аудио формат, мисля, че точно той ме накара да довърша книгата.Основният ми проблем с “Богатство” е, че не усетих героите до степен да ги мразя или да им съчувствам, като цяло ми бяха безразлични.

But of the four sections - written in different styles and perspectives - starting with the first which is the epitome of the ""unreliable narrator"" - only 2 were interesting and the other two sections were a challenge to read. The opening section is an Edith Wharton pastiche about the life of a NY financier in the early part of the twentieth century. I liked that section (though others differed) - but then the book goes off into another -challenging to read - second section - an unfinishished memoir of the financier from the first book. The third book is that book being written from the point of view of the financier's ghost writer and secretary. This for me was the best section - and just as we move towards the big reveal. There is the 4th section - notes from a journal writer by the financier's wife with a ""big reveal"" but which to read is a big bore. I think of Faulkners Sound & Fury - where the story is told through different perspective and finally revealed by the end to a great payoff. I feel the payoff in Trust was not there for me - too much style - not enough substance. By the end I didn't care and just wanted to finish the book to discuss at my book club!"

From the cover art, I had always thought this was a sci-fi novel, but in fact it’s historical fiction about an early 20th century stock trader and his wife. I was hooked from page one. Then, there was a bit of a lull halfway through when the story abruptly changed narrators, but it picked back up and again I was absorbed. One thing I appreciated about the writing was that it was so specific and detailed to particular times, places, and technical processes (like stock trading) without being dull. It felt authentic and immersive. I also really appreciated the themes around history as storytelling, and how the teller of the story has such an impact on the history that is remembered - the history of slavery and capital, of anarchism in America, of a woman’s life and character. A well-deserved Pulitzer in my opinion. And, the ending is wonderful, heartbreaking and satisfying in the injustice revealed. ""The orchestra played Puccini and the sort of music that you always know what's going to come next, that you can listen to ahead, as it were.""So nicely put. This defines the classical form. Music that one almost doesn't need to listen to, because its development is all implied by the form. Just as Rhys says in her passage,""you always know what's going to come next."" This music creates an unavoidable future for itself. It has no free will. There's only fulfillment. It’s fatal music."

And overall this lived up to the hype! The structure of the book was unlike anything I've read before. Part of the reading experience is piecing together how the different sections fit together. Because of this, the less you know going into the book, the better, in my opinion. SPOILERS: I really appreciate how Diaz disrupted our expectations of who is at the soul of this book. Helen/Mildred, like her contemporaries, were silenced in their time. Diaz reconstructs a plausible way that these women could have fashioned a life and some modicum of agency. Diaz also troubles the trope of the delicate, sickly wealthy woman. All of the characters across these sections are so vividly outlined. Ida's father and his hypocrisy and pride stand out. The sympathetic and even pitying portrait of Rask. But the men, although they take up much of the official narrative and pontificate loudly, are really mere side characters to the women of this book. I also always love a book that details process--be that the process of Rask making money off money or Ida drafting her manuscripts. A very rich book--rich in so many senses of the word."

301,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"More than a week after finishing it, I am still not sure how I feel about this book. I love weird structures in novels, and at the same time I found this one quite confusing. The book begins with a novel-in-a-novel, chronicling the life of a highly successful financier in 1920s and 1930s NYC, and the eventual grueling mental demise of his beloved wife. When that novel ends, we get notes for a biography of a highly successful financier of the same period, who is incensed by the novel's use of him as a roman a clef character. Part 3 is the account of a woman who was hired by the Part 2 financier to turn his notes into a book, which involves ... well ... a good deal of tact, detective work, and inventiveness on her part. And Part 4 truly is a spoiler for the entire story of this man's fictionalized and real experience.Diaz is funny, biting, perceptive, and clever, and the book held my interest all the way through the four parts. What I think is missing is something at the beginning to give the reader a place to stand, so that the unfolding story feels more like a pageant and less like three rounds of having the rug yanked out from under you. I wouldn't say this is as good as most Booker Prize winners I've read, and at the same time it's good enough to be a candidate for a prize of that magnitude."

Nulla da dire sulla prosa di Hernan Diaz, che ha modo di brillare però solo nella terza e quarta parte del libro che - pur derivative - si fanno leggere volentieri. La prima sezione del libro è invece di una voluta, imbarazzante retorica, mentre la seconda di una deliberata incompletezza: e il problema di libri così, libri alla Cloud Atlas, che giocano con le potenzialità della scrittura e stratificano racconti su racconti, è che il lettore è anche disposto ad apprezzare lo sperimentalismo solo se il romanzo resta interessante da leggere. La terza parte, senza dubbio la più interessante, presenta quello che è a mio parere il punto di forza del libro, ovvero l'analisi del complicato rapporto fra la protagonista e il padre, unici personaggi vagamente tridimensionali del romanzo.La quarta parte è molto, molto ispirata alle famose lettere che Zelda Sayre scrisse al marito Francis Scott Fitzgerald da sanatori e manicomi... che tutto il romanzo sia una sorta di omaggio al loro rapporto, spesso oggi riletto in chiave femminista in modo da far passare Scott come un fantoccio inetto e Zelda come la vera mente dietro ai suoi successi?

307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7001005-carmen-daza-m-rquez,Rating 5 out of 5,"Empecé a leer esta novela tres días antes de que se proclamara ganadora del premio Pulitzer de 2023, galardón para el que ya había quedado finalista la anterior novela del autor (nada mal para un autor argentino afincado en Nueva York y que escribe en inglés). De modo que no fue el premio, sino la recomendación de parte de una persona en cuyo criterio lector confío plenamente, lo que me llevó a esta obra. Y su lectura ha sido una verdadera revelación.El autor declara que su motivación a la hora de escribir esta obra fue el adentrarse en los mecanismos financieros que han llevado a algunas familias a amasar enormes fortunas a lo largo de la historia. Y se centra concretamente en una familia norteamericana porque estas fortunas por lo general están basadas en el algodón y el tabaco, productos ligados de manera inseparable con el esclavismo. Siguiendo la famosa frase de Balzac, «El secreto de las grandes fortunas es un crimen olvidado ejecutado con limpieza». Y para cuando el protagonista de esta novela empieza a multiplicar su fortuna jugando en la bolsa durante las primeras décadas del siglo XX, los posibles crímenes de sus ancestros están ya más que olvidados.Sin embargo, que todo esto no lleve a nadie a engaño: no hay denuncia ni crítica social alguna en estas páginas, si el estudio de los mecanismos que mueven a las fortunas es el punto de partida y tal vez también el núcleo central de la obra, su trama y su desarrollo se mueven por terrenos muy diferentes, porque la novela es una auténtica muñeca rusa donde cada nivel que se abre va a llevar dentro de sí un nuevo nivel que abrir y explorar. Entrar a explicar esto de manera detallada supondría hacer un destripe a fondo de la forma y el contenido de la novela, arruinando así el placer lector de quien se va a encontrar con estos hallazgos por primera vez. De modo que me limitaré a señalar que el libro en sí, en lo que respecta a su estilo narrativo, es un viaje desde la novela decimonónica hasta la postmodernidad, ofreciendo por medio de una novela corta, una autobiografía, una crónica y un diario las diferentes facetas de un relato que el lector tendrá que recomponer. O no, porque la herencia de Borges es indiscutible en la visión que tiene Hernán Díaz sobre la relación entre realidad y ficción, tanto en la vida como en la literatura. La realidad y la ficción, el espejo y el reflejo, se van mezclando y se van haciendo uno, hasta que finalmente va a resultar difícil saber cuál es la verdad, si es que dicha verdad ha existido en realidad alguna vez.Esta novela es un ejercicio formal y conceptual impresionante, que se deja leer como un bestseller pero que contiene unas profundidades vertiginosas para quien quiera asomarse a ellas. Hernán Díaz no escribe un libro para contar una historia, sino que cuenta una historia para explorar las posibilidades narrativas que puede desarrollar a partir de ella, exponiendo en las páginas de su libro una visión de la economía, de la realidad y de las relaciones humanas que a su vez se plasma en un relato ameno, apasionante y accesible a cualquier lector."

309,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14040955-ignacio,Rating 4 out of 5,"Fortuna no es exactamente un conjunto de cuatro historias, y ni siquiera cuatro versiones de una misma historia. Los cuatro textos que la componen hablan unos con otros, se interpelan, se contradicen y se iluminan, y no siempre lo hacen de manera consciente. Las conexiones quedan en manos del lector, y la novela, la verdadera novela -si la entendemos como una experiencia de lectura, antes que cualquier otra cosa- está precisamente ahí. El universo autocontenido de Fortuna es como un ingenioso simulador de intertextualidad. También es otras cosas; entre ellas, un comentario (ayudado por esta operación intertextual) sobre la dificultad de las mujeres para ser narradoras de sus propias historias; entre ellas, también, una prueba del talento de Hernán Díaz, que en Fortuna construye cuatro voces narrativas únicas, incluida una nouvelle completa en un estilo que evoca al de Edith Wharton. Aunque es una lectura que, en lo personal, disfruté mucho, no puedo dejar de notar algunos de sus problemas. Por ejemplo, la decisión de Bevel de contratar a una secretaria ignota (cuyos talentos literarios resultaron prácticamente una casualidad) para escribir su autobiografía, lo que parece responder a la necesidad de compaginar el rol de Ida como ghostwriter con su precaria situación social y su futuro éxito como novelista. Lo que es todavía más cuestionable, porque afecta a la totalidad del edifico de Fortuna es la propia decisión de Bevel de corregir la novela que de forma escasamente velada se había escrito sobre él. ¿Por qué lo hace? En el texto de Ida, se nos da a entender que es por defender la memoria de su esposa y desmentir el rumor de que murió a causa de un tratamiento brutal para una enfermedad mental. Al final, nos enteramos de que, en realidad, lo que quería era ocultar otra cosa: que parte de su éxito como inversor se debía, precisamente, a la ayuda de su esposa. Pero ahí es donde está el problema: la novela a la que Bevel se proponía corregir, justamente, lo ensalzaba como el inversor intuitivo, de poderes casi sobrenaturales, que había quizás causado por sí mismo el crack del año 29. Y esta es la versión de su propia vida que Bevel sostiene en su biografía. En cuanto al rol de su esposa, sacando el detalle de su muerte, la relega a un lugar subalterno que no difiere en gran cosa del que había ocupado de acuerdo a la novela de Vanner. ¿Acaso este es un Bevel que, como muchos criminales, busca de alguna manera ser atrapado? Sería una lectura interesante, hasta posible, pero quizás demasiado benévola."
310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38040584-derek,Rating 4 out of 5,"Intelligent, historically informed, and well-written, Trust interweaves a number of interesting themes into the multivocal narrative, including American economic history, gender, mental health, and historical or biographical uncertainty. I liked the book and saw enough talent from the author that I expect to see him produce a truly great novel in the near future. However, I wasn’t personality convinced that the book’s four overlapping and sometimes competing stories were necessary. On the one hand, I think a single unreliable narrative perspective would have been more radically unstable than those four storylines taken as a whole. And on the other hand, many freshman history primary source readers include ten or more different perspectives on a single historical event and therefore show much greater complexity about interpreting the past than these four accounts do. (Aside: I never thought I’d say this but the book isn’t postmodern enough for my taste). I guess I also felt like the author had too many themes and might have concentrated on one to get a richer exploration of that single theme. For instance, the book examines competing ideas about a key event in US and global history, the Great Depression, but then delivers relatively few economic and financial details on the subject."

Lui uomo dell’alta finanza americana che prendendo posizioni finanziarie rischiose ha accumulato ricchezza e patrimoni durante la crisi del 1929. Lei donna brillante dotata di spiccata sensibilità e intelligenza, amante dell’arte in tutte le sue forme. Questi sono due ritratti sommari. In realtà nel romanzo, la storia ci è raccontata in quattro forme diverse, tutte provenienti da narratori inaffidabili. Harold Vanner nella prima prospettiva, Bevel stesso nella seconda; nella terza, Ida Partenza, segretaria assunta da Andrew Bevel per scrivere finalmente un’autobiografia aderente alla realtà e infine i diari di Mildred. Queste sono prospettive mobili di una non – realtà, perché di fatto non ci si può fidare di nessuno, nonostante la forma diaristica che chiude il romanzo ci offre un briciolo di aderenza maggiore ma è solo una visione delle cose. La finanza è raccontata come un mondo che non contempla errori e anche se commessi, permette di piegare la realtà fino ad allinearla e far scomparire l’errore. La storia nella terza parte s’infittisce fino a creare un vortice di caos, che fa mancare l’aria, la narrazione si fa claustrofobica e la solitudine irrompe. Andrew e Mildred erano due persone sole e nelle loro solitudini erano in grado di accettarsi, accorgendosi di essere incompatibili con il resto del mondo e decidendo di condividere una parte del viaggio. Trust è un non – luogo, è il potenziale. È affidarsi al mistero. Sorgente e osservatore sono in continuo movimento, il risultato è dispersivo, non per forza con accezione negativa.Leggendo pensavo che spesso i ricordi sono sommersi dalla stratificazione dei gesti contenuti nella memoria, questo moltiplica le versioni dei fatti che si accumulano nelle curve cerebrali fino a confondersi e alterare la realtà. È un libro che vale la sperimentazione e la forma in cui è scritto, è letteratura."
312,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4406720-baz,Rating 2 out of 5,"Note: The 2 reflects my subjective experience with Trust, and my personal enjoyment. That is all.•Trust is a clever, sophisticated novel that explores the way people’s stories are enfolded in other people’s stories. And distorted by them. How much truth is there in the narrative of one person about another? It’s also a novel about fiction, the American dream, American idealism, and sexism.It has an interesting structure. It’s made up of four parts, with each taking on a different character’s point of view. All are linked to Diaz’s main characters, the super rich and reclusive Andrew Bevel, and his wife Mildred Bevel. The first part is a novel with two characters that are clearly based on Andrew and Mildred. The second part is the manuscript of an autobiography by Andrew Bevel. The third part is a memoir by Andrew’s secretary, and the fourth part is made up of diary entries. Two parts by men, two parts by women.The unfortunate thing is that the novel comes together in its two final parts. It asks the reader to wait, and be patient, to experience and enjoy the gradual unfolding of layers. That’s not a bad thing necessarily. I love to read classics, and a lot of classics begin by “setting the scene”, so to speak, for the first fifty or seventy pages. I’m fine with that because when they’re good I can feel how important the context is, and how juicy it’s all going to get. But Diaz, in Trust, asked me to hold on for half the length of the book, around 200 pages that read like a report, pure exposition.It was all intentional. Diaz is smart and talented. Trust is very controlled and carefully composed. But it wasn’t for me. 200 pages. It did pay off for many readers, but I’m sure it also tired a lot of readers out. Despite the fact that it only got better as it went on, from the third part onwards, I couldn’t forgive it for the first two sections. It asked too much of this reader. But Diaz took risks, and that’s what happens.He won the Pulitzer so he’s done well."

Part One is ‘Bonds’ a successful novel by Harold Vanner in 1938 which purports to tell the story of Benjamin and Helen Rask in the 1920s. He was a legendary Wall Street tycoon; she was the daughter of eccentric aristocrats. Together, they have risen to the very top of a world of seemingly endless wealth—all as a decade of excess and speculation draws to an end. But at what cost have they acquired their immense fortune?‘Generosity is the mother of ingratitude.’In Part Two, we have the beginning of an autobiography entitled ‘My Life’ by Andrew Bevel:‘… lately I have come to believe that I owe it to the public to share some of the decisive moments of my story’.After the 1929 stock market crash made Bevel even wealthier, he found that some people blamed him for causing it. Bevel has his own version of the truth (which has absolutely nothing to do with Vanner’s novel) and eventually engages Ida Partenza to write about his life and especially his late wife, Mildred. Ida finds this difficult: Bevel has a sanitised version of ‘truth’ and severely limits Ida’s access to any information that might challenge this. Perceptions must be controlled, trust, it seems, is in short supply.Time passes by and Bevel passes away. Ida discovers a different version of truth from Mildred Bevel’s diary. And the various pieces fall into place.‘Chaos is a vortex that spins faster with each thing it swallows.’Brilliant metafiction. I loved it.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"

Hernan Diaz' second book.This novel is primarily about Andrew Bevel who shorted the market right before the Great Depression and came out a winner. Trust contains four distinct books in which different characters provide conflicting accounts of the financier and his wife.First we read in Book 1, Bonds, which is a fictional account of Andrew and his wife Mildred. In Bonds, the characters are named Benjamin and Helen Rask.In Book 2, we meet Bevel who is writing his own autobiography with the help of Ida Partenza. We do not meet Ida yet; that happens in Book 3.In Book 3, Ida does very well to get the job ghostwriting Andrew's autobiography. Andrew has 2 goals: 1) dispel the negative impression of him that Bonds has created2) paint a different picture of Mildred, his wife, than that portrayed in BondsBook 4 describes Ida's efforts to find Mildred's journals. She does and they describe Mildred as a much different person than the one described by Andrew.I found this book cumbersome to read, yet filled with lots of food for thought. The book is 406 pages long. It was only half way through that I finally got what the book is about: a person's story can frequently NOT be TRUSTED.Here is the one quote, spoken by Andrew Bevel in Book 3 that absolutely blew me away:""If I’m ever wrong, I must make use of all my means and resources to bend and align reality according to my mistake so that it ceases to be a mistake.”4 stars "
317,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5198410-matthew,Rating 4 out of 5,"A novel told in four parts, ""Trust"" is centered on the 1929 stock market crash and certain events leading up to it. It's kind of a puzzle of a story, as the reader pieces together the different narrative sections and we figure out what is likely true and what is actually fiction. It's also a story of women behind the famous and powerful men who leave their names on philanthropic causes to boost their shady legacies. Lots of questions to ponder (would benefit from re-reading), yet still a very satisfying read, especially if you like the multiple-point-of-view technique, which is not always my favorite but Diaz plays the cards carefully and maintains suspense to the very end."

""Bonds,"" the opening novel within the novel, is strong enough on its own, but as Diaz introduces the consecutive texts (an incomplete, [ghost-written] autobiography, a memoir, and a diary) reality is continuously bent and aligned. Each section is distinctly written and has its own strengths. Every sentence in ""Bonds"" feels cleverly devised, each word selected with intention. I had the most fun with the second section, ""My Life,"" a supposed autobiography laced with notes such as this one from a chapter on the subject's school years: ""MATH in great detail. Precocious talent. Anecdotes."" The third section, ""A Memoir, Remembered,"" is perhaps the most critical as it spins the mysteries and contradictions of the first two sections into a driving narrative. The final section, ""Futures,"" presents excerpts from a diary written by Mildred Bevel, the enigmatic figure at the center of these competing perspectives. Diaz, I think, is less interested in the ""Which story is true?"" question and more interested in how we select and form ""truth"" to suit our needs. Reality bent and aligned over and over again. Laced throughout is commentary on social and economic theory, Smith, Marx, Polanyi, etc. Neat! If that's the kind of thing you're into. Great fun. Good read. Five stars."

The first part is a fictional story by Harold Vanner. It’s about an over the top very rich couple, the Rasks, who succeed in the financial world, though have major personal issues. The second part is a short, matter of fact, unfinished autobiography by Andrew Bevel whose life shares many parallels with the Rasks. Part three is told by journalist / typist, Ida Partenza, who is employed by Bevel to improve his autobiography. Bevel wants to provide a more factual, smoothly written account of his life than he believes was portrayed by the writer, Harold Vanner. Ida believes Bevel’s account of his life isn’t the true story. Ida in particular disagrees with Bevel’s account of his wife, Mildred.

320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11289869-polly-roth,Rating 2 out of 5,"Trust is unlike anything I've read before. It is novel told in four parts: first as a novel, then as an autobiography, then as a memoir, and then as a diary. The story follows a fictitious stock trader Andrew Bevel and his wife Mildred through the 1920's and the Great Depression. It definitely gives ""finance is the root of all evil"" vibes, which like, whoops lol.I won't lie, I was pretty confused until the 3rd part started laying everything out more clearly. I think a lot of confusion stems from the synopsis only summarizing the first part, the novel about Benjamin Rask. In the 2nd part, Diaz switches to Andrew Bevel's autobiography, and it isn't until part 3 that I understood who he is in relation to part 1. I also think the 4 narrative styles are too different to work cohesively in one book. It's jarring to go from prose to sentence fragments back to prose to lyrical musings. Also, the whole ending is pretty anti-climatic. You wait 300 pages and 4 different books to find out who this couple actually was and the answer is just that Mildred was a super genius. I wish there had been more of a reveal. Overall, I think Trust tries too hard. It's not that clever and it's not enjoyable to read."

It's a construct somewhat reminiscent of Cloud Cuckoo Land, but instead of characters across time united by the same text, it's characters from the same time divided by their perspectives on the text. The human interest aspect -- how history is written by historians and not by the people who actually make history -- I appreciated intellectually but not viscerally for the most part. I wanted the book to be mostly the last section, the memoir of the ghost writer who ultimately sees things with clear eyes. I guess the point is you never know when you're seeing through clear eyes.Apologies to my GoodReaders for so many 3 star reviews lately; ""it's not them it's me.""🙄"

It's set in New York City around the time of the great depression and tells the story of a wealthy businessman and his wife. There are many side stories but the focus is a character study of a cold calculating tycoon and his wife, a brilliant but sickly philanthropist. The couple is presented to the reader at first through the eyes of a novelist who tells their story; then a writer who is subsequently hired by the tycoon to write a ""true"" account. This biography is intended as a PR tool to correct the impression created by gossip at the time and fortified by the novelist's story that the tycoon single-handedly created the great depression. Finally the story is told through the wife's diaries as read by the writer who was hired to write the white-washed version. I am haunted by the story. "

It's essentially four books in one, each telling the story of a New York financier from a different perspective. Diaz asks for a lot of patience from his reader as the first book, a novel within the novel, doesn't really set out anything clear about the plot or the main characters. Each of the subsequent books—an autobiography, a memoir, and a series of journal entries— unravels pieces of the plot. Diaz does an exceptional job of giving each book a distinct voice and tone.This is a story about the great men of history, American exceptionalism and the soullessness inherent in amassing enormous wealth. Most interestingly for me, Diaz explores the thin line between myth and reality and the power of money in creating the realities the rich wish to forge."

Not to make light of the novel's intelligence, but I kept thinking of Costanza: ""Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie if you believe it."" And also the famous quote ""History is written by the victors."" How do we decided who to trust to tell us stories we believe? (This could get into a while thing about confirmation bias and the current news media, but this isn't that story.)Diaz is an amazingly agile writer, and he's got some real twists and turns up his sleeve as he slowly reveals more and more about the story HE wants to tell, wants us to read.

Four chapters, the titles of which appear to have no context to the one before it - and the finale does tie them together, but as elusively as their juxtaposition. That said, such a substantial and mentally teasing novel; novel within a novel, moral conundrums or reality manipulation. Summaries abound here so I won’t go into detail. There are four points of view, and all concern wealth- the acquisition of money, the Crash of 1929, the stock market and its manipulation. “Trust” - the creation of money, in lieu of real items exchanged; a trust, money held as wealth; trust, our believability, honesty, our truth… The legacy of trust- how could it be grossly distorted when immense wealth chooses to alter its reality?
