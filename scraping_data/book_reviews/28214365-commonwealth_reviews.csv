I know this book has fantastic reviews and I respect that, but this is just not for me. I was waiting for something to happen to pique my interest and it just didn't by the halfway point. The main problem for me is that I am a mother of young children which makes me overly sensitive toward these innocent kids. I had a hard time with all of the child neglect and poor parenting decisions in this book. I had a VERY hard time stomaching the Benadryl/gin/gun incident with the six children - little Albie being only 5 or 6 years old!?!? And the parents showing up at the children's motel room at 2pm the next day saying they ""slept in""??? Or Teresa getting excited to have summers ""off"" from her children? Then Teresa sending them on a plane to their fathers house for a couple months without luggage??? Teresa was trying to ""punish"" her ex by making him buy everything the kids needed, but it's the kids who would suffer without their personal belongings and everyday comfort objects. These poor children are shipped back and forth between parents and states and then left to their own devices most of the time. Often, I found it hard to keep track of the children - which child belonged to which parents. I didn't connect with any characters. I liked Franny (a little), although I found the lead up to her affair extremely awkward and uneventful. Overall, I found this book to be slow and depressing. I know I'm in the minority, so please read other reviews before deciding on this book!"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow....I have spent hours thinking about this book. The characters are deep in my mind. There will be NO SPOILERS in my review!!! NONE!!!!If you need a 'little' information to know weather you want to risk reading an Ann Patchett book, which I clearly do not understand.....lol,the blurb gives enough details about this story. I'm only going to spit out random thoughts.... ( a discussion group would be enriching....one I'd love to be part of) I wasn't 100% crazy about every scene - every minute of this novel....yet overall I have to give this book a high top rating of 5 stars.These characters won't fade away easily. Believe me... You'll know all of them pretty darn well by the time you finish this book - and you won't need to take a single note. You'll just easily remember names and details ... ( HUGE CREDIT to ANN PATCHETT) I 'definitely' have 2 - ok- 3 ....shit....4 favorite scenes....But I think EVERYONE would be 'crazy-in-their-head'.....not to think the opening chapter is one of the most brilliant - stand out - memorable scenes to come along in a contemporary family-saga novel in YEARS!!!!! Readers will 'want' to talk about the opening scene. It's just normal!!! 1964 becomes very visual inside the Keating's house. My next favorite scene -- equally as brilliant as the first chapter ...( just different)....was a turn-on. ( alluring with tension to down-right hot). I'm not proud! Go, Ann Patchett! I never knew a waitress taking off her shoes could be so enticing. My next favorite scene scared the shit out of me - and then .... I said... ""Whew"".... Ok, we survived""?/!/?......Kids...breakfast ...candy bars... a walk to the lake?.....A personal share about my life: I have 4 first cousins. Add my older sister and I. The six of us spent our summer's together growing up. Some of us are married with children - some of us have been divorce - and re-married-- with blended families... There have been affairs - births - deaths All have traveled - some live in Israel -others now in the Midwest ..some still here in California. -- BUT our growing years were in Oakland/Berkeley and Piedmont. We are Rabbi's, lawyers, teachers, Doctors, Bart employees, mothers, fathers, grandparents, and some of us retired. It was easy to relate to this story for me - especially when the kids were smaller - exploring off on their own without parental supervision. That's how it was when I was growing up too. No adults knew of the trouble we got into. We just showed up in time for dinner.A FUNNY SCENE: feeding the children like they were the Von Trapp family. I was dying laughing!! ( you must read the scene yourself) Enough of this non-review-review! I liked this book!!! I wanted to change a couple of scenes - ( but that's part of what makes this book good, too) Point is... I was involved! I was fully invested and committed --living along side this family. Thank You to Harper Press and Ann Patchett "
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes,Rating 4 out of 5,"When Bert Cousins saw Beverly Keating it was love at first sight. Never mind that they met at the christening party for her second child. Never mind that Bert had a wife and several progeny of his own. He wanted this incredibly beautiful woman. This was the start of his life. It was also the end of two marriages, beginning a ripple that would continue spreading its impact over the next half century. Jump all those fifty years, more or less. Beverly’s ex, Fix Keating, the one she had left for Bert, is battling cancer. His daughter, Franny, the baby being christened in chapter one, is there to help out. Jump back to Bert and Beverly moving to Virginia in the 1960s, her two kids in tow and his four arriving for the summer. Jump to Franny working at a Chicago bar after dropping out of law school, and meeting a literary icon. The large jumps mean that we get only small fragments of entire lifetimes. It may be the writer’s impulse, as it is for many visual artists, to pare a story down to essentials, significant moments that define the substance of the tale being told. This happened then, and the rest followed from that. The notion being, I expect, that you don’t really need all that in-between material to see the path. If we see cause (pebble in the pond) we don’t need to see every single ripple, or the spaces between them, to understand that the ripples we do see arrived as a result of the initial stone.Ann Patchett - from The GuardianCommonwealth, another strong addition to Ann Patchett’s body of work, should be sold with springs in the binding for the considerable chronological leaps Patchett takes in giving us a portrait of people and families that emerge from the marital mixer. Given how many folks these days lived, live, or will live in blended families, Patchett among them us, there should be plenty of resonance for large portions of the reading public. The Keating kids move with their mother from California to Virginia when Beverly remarries. This echoes the author’s history, as she had made a similar move as a kid when her mother remarried, leaving LA for Tennessee. Her stepfather’s four kids stayed in California, as Bert’s kids do in the novel. The commonwealth of kids in both Patchett’s actual life and in her novel comes in at a half dozen, so she knows of what she writes. Her father, like Fix Keating had career in the LAPD. Patchett made good use of her work as a waitress to inform her description of Franny working at a bar in Chicago. There is plenty more of Ann Pachett’s life sewn into her story.There are two major events in the book from which much of the repercussion spreads. Beverly leaving her husband to marry someone else and move a continent away, and a tragic death that take place when the six kids are all together in the east. In The Getaway Car, a memoir-ish piece she wrote about writing (included in her non-fic collection This is the Story of a Happy Marriage), Patchett notes
...I’ve always been grateful (and somewhat amazed) that I read The Magic Mountain in my high school English class. That novel’s basic plot—a group of strangers are thrown together by circumstance and form a society in confinement—became the story line for just about everything I’ve ever written.
That would certainly fit here as the six step-sibs form their own community of sorts, one in which they may not have absolute power, but one in which they exercise as much group autonomy as possible. The circumstance in which they find themselves and the relationships that are formed there will affect the rest of their lives. Maybe the point is that we are all in it together, for better or worse, for ups and downs, for dislocation and for stasis, for jumps and for landings. Maybe it is just Patchett telling the story of her family. You could take it either way, or both ways. Neither interpretation would require a leap. There is a lot here on parenting. Much of it reflecting the attitudes of different eras. It is not so strange, for example, that a 1960s lawyer would leave most of the parenting to his homemaker wife, or wives, as the case may be. That reflected the pre-Lib ethos that ruled at the time. But Bert is definitely presented as an absentee parent. His ex, coping as a single mother with four kids, is stretched to the limit, 
The speed at which their mother ran from work to school to the grocery store to home had doubled. She was always arriving, always leaving, never there.
but there is definitely a question as to how attentive a mother she would have been under any circumstances. Patchett plays the cheaper-by-the-half-dozen set up for a bit of light humor.
Their mother made everyone line up in the kitchen according to age and come to the stove with their plate instead of putting the food on the table in dishes as she did every other night of the year. In the summers they wandered out of the civilized world and into the early orphanage scenes of Oliver Twist.
And there is one particular bit involving the youngest of the crew, six-year-old Albie, and some inappropriate music, that is howlingly funny. But there are events in the half-dozen’s time together that are as serious as a heart attack. And those secrets threaten to come to light when Franny’s literary fling absorbs the family tale from her and reproduces it as an original novel, titled Commonwealth. And then, worse, a movie.The big time shifts in Commonwealth were both jarring and refreshing. Definitely makes the reader heat up those gray cells and get them sparking. I did wish, however that there had been more material about several of the characters. And some more indication of why they were the way they were. Why, for example, was Bev so open to moving on from her first marriage? The structure holds with only a few supporting pillars, but I wanted more rebar, closer together. I was reminded of Jennifer Haigh’s novel, Baker Towers, which was pretty good. But the author later wrote News From Heaven, a story collection that fleshed out the Baker Towers stories some more. I have no idea if Patchett has more material in store for these characters, but it would not be a bad idea if she did. Patchett’s writing here is closer to home than in some of her well-known novels. Her birthplace, Los Angeles, instead of Bel Canto’s unspecified Somewhere, South America, Virginia (standing in for Tennessee when she grew up and where she still lives) instead of the remote Amazon of State of Wonder. The characters and situations, clearly drawn from Patchett’s life, resonate with a palpable reality, even though no one of them holds the stage long enough. Connections are made between events and their consequences, supported by a swath of vignette and sharp observation. You are unlikely to relate to all the commonwealth members or their outer circle, but there are bound to be some characters who trip your connection switches, and others whose circumstances, and maybe ways of being you will recognize. A society of people will not rise, fall, or sustain, as a result of reading Commonwealth, but it would definitely be in their collective self-interest to do so. It is a fascinating look at how change can affect our lives, and how we might find some sustenance by facing the world with the help and support of those with whom we have been thrown together.Publication - 9/13/2016Review Posted and first posted - 6/10/2016=============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author’s personal, Twitter and FB pagesPatchett seems to have stopped adding tweets to her Twitter page in 2011, but the feed from the bookstore in which she is a partner, Parnassus Books, is alive and wellThe only other Ann Patchett book I have reviewed is State of Wonder.

3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1151637-roxane,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved this book. Gorgeously written, as is always the case with Ann Patchett. There is an ambitious narrative structure that, at times, gets away from the writer, but still, this is so so good."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.88, who do I appreciate?I’ve been putting off writing this review because I’ve been hoping that as time goes on, I’ll sit up and chirp instead of sit down and burp. But, alas, I am not chirping. The song is more or less forgotten, so I can’t in good conscience give this a wowsy 4 stars. It’s more like a 3.88, who do I appreciate, which I will round up to 4 because, well, ultimately I do appreciate Ann Patchett. I’m messed up when it comes to this writer. I insanely loved State of Wonder (declaring it an all-time favorite) but absolutely hated Bel Canto. I read a couple of other books by her that I liked, but nothing came anywhere close to State of Wonder. Then along came Commonwealth, and expectations were high. Of course I want everything she writes to do the same thing that State of Wonder did to me, but it’s a setup for failure when you want to re-create something that was perfect, like trying to find a pet that’s as perfect as the one you lost. This book just did not set fire to my soul. I wasn’t uttering a meh, mind you, but I wasn’t doing a jig either. It’s a good story, just not particularly memorable.But hot diggety--only two items on my Complaint Board! The small complaint first: Too many players! It’s not a crime if I have to draw a family tree, but laziness made me try to keep all the characters straight without having to find paper and pen and start sketching. There are two sets of parents with 6 kids among them—2 from one family and 4 from another. See? Already it’s hard. They become step-sibs who spend long summers together. Remembering which kids belongs to which mom and dad was tough at times. The bigger complaint: There's this weird distance that Patchett maintains, this formality. Maybe it’s just her tone, I don’t know. If I ever met her I'm pretty sure I’d say “how do you do” instead of “hi.” I sort of feel like I know the characters but I am also acutely aware they are far away in a story, not sitting next to me whispering their secrets into my ear. And damn, instead it is Patchett the storyteller sitting there beside me, her voice sometimes blocking out the voice of the characters, and forcing me to pay attention to her. I like it better when I get completely absorbed with the characters and forget there’s a puppet master pulling the strings.There are a lot of good things. Patchett rolls up her sleeves and cooks up a believable and interesting story. She really is a master storyteller. She paints the picture in broad strokes. The dialogue is not particularly rich but I like her sentence structure, the way she dresses the story--atop some good bones. Her plot is clever and sort of unusual (I found myself thinking, how did she come up with THAT secret), and it has the right amount of foreshadowing. And she doesn’t have any over-the-top drama or dialogue that would make it seem unrealistic. Her language is impeccable and she weaves scenes together beautifully, sometimes even while jumping back and forth between time periods. I discovered something curious. Even though I’m all over it if there are too many mundane little things being described, Patchett for some reason can get away with it without sending me screaming for my Complaint Board. I’m thinking it’s her sophisticated language that makes the simple details sound acceptable. And she has a real talent for painting a vivid picture with an economy of words.The book opens at a christening party for baby Franny, who is the main character of the story. It is there that the married Albert lustfully eyeballs Franny’s beautiful married mother, Beverly. By the next chapter or two, the story jumps to Albert and Beverly being a married couple (we don’t get the story of how the divorces went down). Patchett wins the prize for the weirdest man’s name ever—Beverly’s cuckolded husband is named Fix. Seriously. With the new family structures in place, we start getting to know all the children of the two divorces. The kids have a secret (oh how I love a good secret), and the repercussions of this secret are at the core of the story. I loved the way Patchett described how the kids formed a tribe that was theirs alone. The tribe had the innocence of childhood, and the ties among the kids were touching and real. While their parents dealt with their own adult dramas, the kids were often left to themselves, a pack of little kids having adventures and doing things that the parents would freak out about if they knew. It made me think about how complicated and fascinating sibling dynamics are. I’m one of five kids; the story reminded me of how it felt to be around many siblings, and it sent me down memory lane.Patchett really is good at developing characters. I liked the personalities that she gave each kid, especially, and the way they interacted was believable and intriguing. The book spans about 50 years; I was invested in seeing what kind of adults these kids grew into. And as other reviewers have mentioned, the adults could have come right out of the TV series Mad Men. Whereas the young kids were busy (mostly) having fun, the adults seemed incredibly sad and sometimes boozy. Franny’s story is the most developed. As an adult she has a relationship with an idol that will affect the entire family (hint: it has to do with the relationship between reality and art). And she is the main kid who cares for her ailing dad at the end. Despite the fact that there was a tragedy, this was basically a tame family drama, well-done and realistic. But I always clamor for edge! Even though I’m a total chicken and won’t even put the tip of my toe over any edge, I sure like my fictional characters to be perched, fearless, and going for the plunge. For instance, wouldn’t it have been bizarre and juicy if two of the step-kids had gotten it on? Now THAT might have made me sit up and chirp! But that would be a whole ‘nother story for a whole ‘nother day…"

For example.In early 2020, I read The Dutch House after being full-on fixated with the cover for almost a year, and I liked it. I didn't five stars level love it, but I gave it 4.5 and wrote a big review and blah blah blah.So the normal thing to do in this scenario would be keep the author, Ann Patchett, on my radar, and move on.Instead, for reasons inexplicable even to me, I went out and bought every reasonably priced Patchett book I could find, immediately. This is Greek-level pride and deserves a corresponding level of tragedy. For my hubris, I should be struck down immediately by a lightning bolt straight from Mount Vesuvius.Instead, I read a book with the ugliest cover I have ever seen in my life, and an equally lame title, and boom. Four point five, AGAIN.Then I read this book, and here we are. A trio of four-plus star reads. I'm going to live forever.This is a literary fiction about a family, which, excluding a literary fiction about unlikable women, is my favorite thing for a book to me. This is very beautifully written, and I love my new family, and in spite of the fact that there isn't really a plot here, I couldn't put it down.Along with The Immortalists, this is one of two lit fics about a bunch of siblings I gave 4 stars to in one week. What a peak of my life.I didn't love the individual characters in this very profoundly (which is rare for me), so this is not a perfect read, but damn it's close.

I adore Ann Patchett! I just could not connect with this family drama or any of the characters. I can't fault her writing or the story or how it was laid out; it just was not compelling to me. I liked it in a very mild way, but I am not sure I'll remember much about it in a few months.I'm sorry, fellow Patchett lovers! Not my favorite of her works."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a moving novel about the blended modern family inspired by Ann Patchett's own personal family history. In the early 1960s, the married Bert Cousins is a deputy DA, out of sorts with his lot in life and family, and looking for something more. He rolls up uninvited to Franny Keating's christening party, and oiled by alcohol, falls in love with and kisses the beautiful Beverly Keating. This leads to the disintegration of the two respective families and a catalogue of repercussions down the years. In a narrative that shifts from person to person over 50 years in a non linear manner, with multiple threads, the greatest focus is on Franny. The story resonates strongly as so few of us today have experience of a family without divorce, separations, remarriages, and step relations. Bert and Beverly move to Virginia where, during the summer months, the six children from their marriages run wild in a way that would be less common today. The six are subject to all the strife that afflict a group of children but form strong bonds over their disappointments with and hatred of their parents. Patchett lets us get to know her characters well through detailed descriptions and vignettes of events, incidents and secrets. There is much comic humour, sorrows and tragedy in the highs and lows of a blended family. Franny is a law school dropout and becomes a waitress. She becomes involved with a writer, Leon Posen, to whom she confides her family history. Like a parasite, Posen appropriates this history to pen a bestseller that spawns a movie. This triggers the revisiting of a hidden past as the truth emerges. Fix Keating, LAPD cop, has cancer and it is Franny that comes to care for her father.Patchett gives us a a human and insightful look at the complexities of the dysfunctional modern family through the Cousins and the Keatings. Her character development is impressive, particularly with regard to Albie. There are perhaps an over abundance of characters but Patchett handles them adroitly. I was touched by her positivity with regard to the challenges of a blended family and of how time eventually is likely to iron out the wrinkles. A brilliant novel that I highly recommend. Thanks to Bloomsbury for an ARC."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m,Rating 4 out of 5,"Life is messy a lot of the time and no matter how much people love their families, I think we have to admit that we've all experienced some of the messiness that happens in life. The book opens with a christening party with lots of alcohol and you can't help but think by the end - how that first bottle of gin changed so many lives . While these are very different stories by Ann Patchett, the party scene with the house full of people reminded me just a little of the house full of people in Bel Canto - a lot of people and a lot going on, multiple stories and multiple conversations. That's where the similarities ended but the feel of that was familiar. Fast forward ,decades later and we learn just how much of what happens at this party has affected lives - two couples have divorced and the 6 children they have between them have forged unexpected bonds over their childhood and as adults. The narrative moves around in time and and we in essence don't have the full story of what happens over the years, but snap shots of this blended family. While it seems that there is not much of a plot, the story is full of life . You may not like every one of these characters but yet they seemed real, real enough that you understand why some of them are not happy with how their story is portrayed in the novel written about them by another character ! Recommended to fans of Patchett and anyone else who enjoys family dramas.Thanks to Harper Collins and Edelweiss."
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166369-annet,Rating 5 out of 5,"Well, I simply loved this book. 4.5 going on 5. One of the highlights in 2016. Wonderful storytelling about two families getting 'intertwined' by changed marriages, affected by a family tragedy that hit them all in some way. The story is written going to and fro in time, and we follow several family members in their personal lives at some point in time. It's a story full of emotion, tragedy, love... Beautiful & heartfelt... and highly recommended. Thanks to all Goodreads friends who brought me to this book!Note, and when I started reading I realized I have 'State of Wonder' of the same author in my library 'collection'. Never got round to reading it yet, although it passed thru my hands several times ;-) Will read it soon :-)Beginning lines of Commonwealth sets the stage: The Christening party took a turn when Albert Cousins arrived with the gin. Fix was smiling when he opened the door and he kept smiling as he struggled to make the connection: it was Albert Cousins from the district attorney's office standing on the cement slab of his front porch....

The fun kind. One with lots of friends and family and somehow booze gets into the mix and what started off as a ritual turned into a party then spice in some infidelity and the wheels are put into motion for a family life detour.This is a story about families- their dysfunction, destruction, and loyalty. Truths are exposed after the publication of a novel that is loosely based on the 2 families. It's the realIzation of truths when secrets are revealed. Patchett expertly packages a novel within a novel - literally- with an abundance of themes-Divorce, addiction, relationships, personal growth, loss and regret.Not linear but not confusing; nice prose, interesting characters and entertaining. My 2nd Patchett. 4*"
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Commonwealth by Ann Patchett is a 2016 Harper publication. This book is a bit of a departure for me, but I’ve been craving something different, something more profound and literary in nature. With Commonwealth, I came to the right place. One fateful Sunday afternoon, Bert Cousins arrives uninvited to Franny Keating’s christening party. He had only shown up to escape his own family life, which included his pregnant wife and three children. But, once he set eyes on the beautiful Beverly Keating, mother of Franny, he knew their fates were sealed. From that day forward life was never the same for the Keating’s or the Cousin’s. Bert and Beverly left their prospective spouses, got married, and like a premonition or example of the future family model, became a blended family.After reading a few reviews for this book, I have to confess, I feel slightly out of my element. Other than an occasional hankering to read a classic novel or perhaps something from Joyce Carol Oates, I rarely choose pure literature, although I love it when that prose shows up in the other genres I enjoy.Covering a vast span of time, the author touches base with all those affected by the disruption of their stable lives, the fallout of Beverly and Bert’s decision to leave their spouses, how their children learned to cope, the bonds they forged, the tragedies they endured, and the various directions their lives took over time, examining their triumphs and failures, loves and losses. The story is told through various stages of the character’s lives, in no particular order, which is a little unusual, and does require your full attention. But, the prose, of course, is so utterly absorbing, I did not want the book to end. I was totally immersed in the lives of these well drawn characters, some of whom were loveable, others not so much, while some are flaky and unsettled, and while some managed quite well in life, others flailed and faltered. It is certainly an interesting character study, giving the reader an inside peek into the lives of all those profoundly affected by the summers they spent in Commonwealth, Virginia. Family is family, blended or not, and this story proves that, with characters who may seem a little familiar to us. I especially loved the pieces of the story each person held secretly within their hearts, and the way they helped each other, even when they could have just as easily turned a cold shoulder. Overall, this is an absorbing and fascinating portrait of family and of life, which any fan of literary fiction will not want to miss. "
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26259-jenne,Rating 3 out of 5,"I found it hard to give this book a rating. On the one hand, it was an excellent example of a literary novel. Great characters, good writing, lots of themes, emotionally engaging, the whole nine.On the other hand, I just don't really understand why people want to read books like this. Why do you want to get inserted into some person's depressing life? No opera singers or magicians or scientists deep in the jungle, just some people living in Los Angeles and dealing with each other's fuckups. What's the point?"
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this book so much I read it twice in three months.Ann Patchett is one of my veryveryvery favorite modern writers, and I was so excited when Commonwealth was released that I dropped everything else I was reading to begin it. Later I had the good fortune to meet Patchett at a book reading in my city, and I gushed about how much I loved her work. She was gracious, smart, witty and kind, and my writer-crush was complete.As for Commonwealth, I treasured this story of a big, sprawling family with children who split their time between California and Virginia. The novel opens at a christening party in the early 1960s at the Los Angeles home of Fix and Beverly Keating. Fix is a cop, and Beverly is a beautiful woman who has an affair with Bert Cousins, an attorney who crashes the party. In upcoming chapters we will meet all of Cousins' children.The next chapter jumps ahead several decades and we see Fix again, although this time he is battling cancer. Fix's daughter, Franny, is visiting him in Los Angeles, trying to spend as much time as she can with her father before he dies. Since the opening scene, Fix and Beverly have divorced and married other people, and as the novel progresses we learn how the Keating children and the Cousins kids have grown up and had adventures together. Other chapters in the book also jump around in the family's history, though we're always following either a Keating or a Cousins. What I loved about this book is how well we get to know this big, messy family, and how real these characters became. Franny and Fix were my favorite, and I especially enjoyed the chapters that focused on Franny's life and her affair with a famous writer.It has taken me months to write a review of this book since I first read it because it's been hard for me to explain why I loved this story so much, probably because it's so personal. I identified with these children of a messy divorce, and I understand what it's like to care for a dying parent. But at heart, I also just love Patchett's writing. Her sentences are gorgeous, her characterization is brilliant, her wit is admirable. Five stars for the wonderful Ann Patchett.P.S. If you're new to Ann Patchett, I think Commonwealth is a good place to start. My other favorite novels of hers are Bel Canto and State of Wonder.

15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi,Rating 4 out of 5,"""Had the Keatings just put the gin in their liquor cabinet no one would have thought less of them. But Fix Keating had given the bottle to his wife, and his wife, worn down by the stress of throwing a good party, was going to have a drink, and if she was going to have a drink then by God everyone at the party was welcome to join her."" A couple receives a very unusual gift at a christening party. I don’t remember anyone ever showing up with a bottle of gin at either of my children’s baptisms, but then again we didn’t invite every soul we knew and then some! In Commonwealth, an uninvited guest will provide the gin, the hostess will squeeze the oranges, and the neighbors will dash to their homes to add to the stash of alcohol. Well, if you’ve ever been to a party with lots of booze, which I suspect you have, then I’m sure you know that something is bound to happen. What happens at the christening party of pretty little Franny Keating will have a lasting effect on two families. I thought this was an entertaining book. The characters are very well developed and seemed so real. Six children and two sets of parents, a good deal of dysfunction, and some very interesting family dynamics make for a lot of drama. Shifting between characters and timelines kept the narrative engaging. I don’t think I would have liked this as much if it had been told in a linear fashion. The story jumped back and forth from when the children were very young, to teen years, to younger adults, and into middle-age. Adults grew into old age. It didn’t trip me up at all, as Patchett managed to pull this off with ease. I worried for these kids, out and about with no or little supervision – would they actually make it into adulthood?! My sister and I were watched like hawks by our parents, so I couldn’t at all relate to this story – perhaps that piqued my interest even more. As is the case with siblings and groups of kids, not everyone got along. Someone is always picked on or exploited for the benefit of the others. That was true here as well. I felt sorry for little Albie! There’s always that little kid that you see in action in real life and you think to yourself, “I wonder how he/she’s going to turn out?” Well, that’s what I thought about Albie. And I found out! I would actually have liked to learn a bit more about Albie in his older years, but there is no way Patchett could cover everyone in detail through adulthood unless she wanted to turn this into a family saga of sorts. There were a couple of things I fussed about while reading this, so I’ll share here. I thought the ending was rushed. I just expected it to perhaps come together a bit more by the end, but it seemed to finish rather abruptly. Also, there was a mystery event that is revealed to the reader in little bits and pieces. I felt the suspense of this building up as I turned the pages. I was eager to return to this part of the story so I could find out what happened. When I did, however, I felt a bit underwhelmed. I don’t know why I thought this was leading us somewhere else. I felt sad rather than shocked. I guess I expected to feel more surprised. I really like Ann Patchett’s concise prose, her storytelling feels fluid even with shifts in time. I liked the reflection on the “what-ifs”. If this one thing had happened differently, then things would have turned out another way. The choices we make lead us down paths that we cannot know ahead of time, but we should know that all of our choices will affect more than just ourselves. This book would appeal to readers that like contemporary fiction and stories about interesting family dynamics. This is my second novel by this author, and I plan to read more! I’m giving Commonwealth 3.5 stars rounded up for the strength in the writing."

What was the point or purpose? I was disappointed because I love Ann Patchett's beautiful writing but this story just never gained momentum. The story started off intriguing, fell into a state of whimsical melodrama and flatlined. At times it was difficult to keep up with all the characters or even care about them. I wanted to give up on this one because I simply never connected with the story.  "
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58194738-noel-nu-ez,Rating 3 out of 5,"SPOILER FREE REVIEWCommonwealth is a story about people's stories. There's a loose thread that binds all the tales together, but for the most part each one is treated separately. There are no surprise endings, no hidden lessons, no zombie apocalypse. Just the slow burn of daily life as the characters make mistakes and learn from them, trying to piece together a meaningful existence like the rest of us.In other words, profound, but way too realistic.How realistic? Well, there's a chapter about a daughter listening to her dad reminisce about his job in the police force. There's a scene where a mother waits inside an airport terminal for her stepchildren's luggage. There's a family road trip where one of the kids keeps saying ""Are we there yet?""That realistic.Most authors would skip through these bland situations in order to save their readers from potential boredom, but not Ann Patchett. She soldiers through them like a woman on a mission. There's no pebble left unturned. By the end of the novel, we feel as if we have enough information to write a biography for each member of the main cast.There's nothing wrong with this approach except for the obvious reason: the pace bogs down considerably in some sections, and a large part of the material is so mundane that I felt tempted to quit the book several times.The first chapter is actually the most exciting: a guest turns up uninvited to a party and proceeds to flirt with the host's attractive wife. They begin an affair and ultimately divorce their respective spouses in order to get married. By the start of the second chapter, it's about fifty years into the future, and the kids from both broken families are all grown-up. The rest of the novel is focused on flashbacks and flash-forwards as each child (there are six in all) shares his or her story and how the divorce has affected them.One of the major problems of this novel is Patchett's huge cast. The six children aside, there are also the four divorced parents, the spouses that the children ultimately married, the grandkids, the in-laws, the friends, the lovers, the enemies, and a wide range of extras and bit players. Inexplicably, Patchett devotes huge chunks of text for even the most minor character. For example, in the first chapter, there is a priest who is given his own scene so that you'd think he has an important role to play, but he never shows up again. In the second chapter, we are treated to a lengthy flashback about a guy called Lomer who was already dead even before the novel began. Heck, there's even a small paragraph where a real estate agent expresses her thoughts.Do we really need that much information on these individuals? The protagonists don't even have enough page time as it is.The second major problem is the extreme use of head-hopping. Patchett starts with a specific character's point-of-view written in the third person, but then leapfrogs to another character with no warning. The result jars you like a turbulent plane. Here's one example, a LONG paragraph where a multitude of perspectives crash together without so much as a break:The children were seated across the aisle from one another, the boys on the left and the girls on the right, and each was given a set of junior airman wings, which only Cal refused to wear. They were glad to be on the plane, glad to be free of direct supervision for six hours. As much as they hated to leave their mother— they were unquestionably loyal to their mother— the four Cousins children thought of themselves as Virginians, even the youngest two, who had been born after the family’s move west. All of the Cousins children hated California. They were sick of being shoved down the hallways of the Torrance Unified School District. They were sick of the bus that picked them up on the corner every morning, and sick of the bus driver who would not cut them a break, even thirty seconds, if they were made late by Albie’s dawdling. They were sick of their mother, no matter how much they loved her, because she had on occasion cried when they returned to the house after missing the bus. Now she would be late for work. She went over it all again in the car as she drove them to school at terrifying speeds— she had to work, they couldn’t live on what their father gave them, she couldn’t afford to lose this job just because they weren’t responsible enough to walk to the goddamn corner on time. They blocked her out by pinching Albie, whose screams filled the car like mustard gas. More than anything they were sick of Albie, who had spilled his Coke all over the place and was at this very moment kicking the seat in front of him on the plane. Everything that happened was his fault. But they were sick of Cal too. He got to wear the house key on a dirty string around his neck because their mother told him it was his job to get everybody home after school and make them a snack. Cal was sick of doing it, and on most days he locked his sisters and brother out for at least an hour so that he could watch the television shows that he wanted to watch and clear his head. There was a hose on the side of the house and shade beneath the carport. It wasn’t like they were going to die. When their mother came home from work they met her at the door screaming about the tyranny of their situation. They lied about having done their homework, except for Holly, who always did her homework, sometimes sitting Indian-style under the carport with her books in her lap, because she lived for the positive reinforcement her teachers heaped on her. They were sick of Holly and the superiority of her good grades. Really, the only person they weren’t sick of was Jeanette, and that was because they never thought about her. She had retreated into a silence that any parent would have asked a teacher or a pediatrician about had they noticed it, but no one noticed. Jeanette was sick of that.Well, I got sick from reading that too. There are a lot more examples throughout the book.Despite these setbacks, I have to give credit to Patchett. She's a superb writer. After all, she won the PEN/Faulkner Award in 2002, and they don't hand out those plaques to amateurs. Even though this is the first novel I read that was written by her, I could tell she has mastered the craft on a sentence level. Here are some juicy passages that I really enjoyed:The six children held in common one overarching principle that cast their potential dislike for one another down to the bottom of the minor leagues: they disliked the parents. They hated them.Here's another one:Bonnie X was wearing a dress with blue daisies on it that was short enough to make a priest wonder where he was supposed to rest his gaze, though when she’d gotten dressed this morning she probably hadn’t taken into account that there would be men sitting on the ground while she remained standing.Here's my favorite:He knew that making a move on a married woman was a bad idea, especially when you were in the woman’s house and her husband was also in the house and her husband was a cop and the party was a celebration of the birth of the cop’s second child. Cousins knew all of this but as the drinks stacked up he told himself there were larger forces at work.In the end, I was satisfied with the novel. The writing quality is through the roof, and Patchett really manages to capture the essence of her characters as well as the feeling of melancholy as we take a trip through their lives from womb to tomb. However, the viewpoint shifting is so frequent it made me nauseous, and the plodding nature of the story requires massive reserves of patience in the reader. If you are willing to sit through some parts where nothing much happens, you will be sufficiently rewarded in the end. But if not for my stubborn principle of always finishing a book that I started, I probably never would have made it that far."
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'd rate this 4.5 stars.""The christening party took a turn when Albert Cousins arrived with gin.""How can you resist a novel that starts like that?Bert Cousins' decision to bring a bottle of gin to a christening party for Fix and Beverly Keating's infant daughter Franny, a party to which he wasn't even invited, is much more than a social faux pas. Showing up at that party makes Bert realize he wants more out of his life than his job as a deputy DA, and his wife and three kids (with one more on the way) can offer him. Simply put, he wants Fix's life, or more specifically, Fix's wife. 
Commonwealth
, Ann Patchett's newest novel, explores the ripple effect that Bert's actions during the christening party have not only on the two couples, but the six children they have between them. Focusing mostly on the children, shifting focus and perspective through five decades, this is a fascinating, moving, at times slightly meandering, but tremendously powerful look at how blended families try to coexist, and the strange and powerful bond that exists among the children in these families.""Half the things in this life I wish I could remember and the other half I wish I could forget.""The Keating and Cousins children grew up spending summers together in Virginia. They were a motley crew of different, and often disparate, personalities and behaviors, from sullen Cal and bossy Caroline, to know-it-all Holly and Albie, the hyperactive baby of both families. Taming Albie's behavior often was an activity that all of the children participated in, which led to a tragic event one summer day, a day which bonded all of the children with a secret they vowed never to share. But years later, in a relationship with a famous author, Franny shared her family's story, leading to the reopening of wounds thought healed (or at least ignored), and revealing more truths than they are ready to share.Who owns our story? Does anyone have the right to tell it? Does revealing hidden truths bring about catharsis, or more pain? Patchett raises interesting questions in this book, as she also looks at the challenges of loyalty affecting children of divorce and remarriage, the difficulty some experience in finding their own path in life, and the advantages and disadvantages of growing older.I've been a big fan of Patchett's throughout her career, devouring and loving all of her books, even the one which many are divided on, 
Bel Canto
. The way she tells a story really immerses you in the middle of it, and her characters are richly drawn, even if they're not always sympathetic. This is a book of moments both big and small, emotions both dramatic and nuanced, and I found it really compelling, even though at times I wondered where she was taking the plot.Family dynamics and dysfunction is a topic often plumbed by fiction writers, and there have been some other really strong novels this year which centered around it, including Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney's 
The Nest
 (see my review) and Calla Devlin's 
Tell Me Something Real
 (see my review), among others. 
Commonwealth
 is a little stronger than both of those, another novel that makes you think as it makes you feel.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo...."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,Rating 4 out of 5,"4+ Early 1960, a christening party for baby Franny, where a spark will be ignited that will set up a chain of events that will echo down through the decades. Four adults, six children will be affected, and we will follow them as they try to maneuver through the many difficulties and tragedies fate will throw at them. The six children from the blended families will form, in the summers they spend together, a little tribe of their own and as a mother the things they got up to, with little adult supervision, made my hair stand on end.Patchett puts together a story of families, flawed families, but family nonetheless and very few do it better. Many of the characters are not likable, my favorite being Fix, the cop and father of two of the female children and one of the girls, the grownup Franny. Yet, they are easily recognizable as people who we may know, or know of, their problems ones shared by many. Wonderfully written, moving back and forth between characters, the reader eventually comes to know something about all of them. Still, this is very much Franny's story, she is the one we come to learn about the most. Like in real life, all do not get a happy ending but getting there, reading about them was a wonderful experience. Reminded me a little of The Children's Crusade, which I also enjoyed.

March 2023 is my ""Realistic Fiction"" Month!Praises:1. strong character development! These people sure can grow on you, and some even showed growth! A couple were relatable, most were unlikeable, but ALL were believable!2. even though timelines and individual POVs went back and forth, I never had difficulty following them; and,3. adultery in stories usually raises my hackles, but author Ann Patchett tones it down enough for me to appreciate how this particular indiscretion affected so many people, especially the children.Overall Thoughts:I enjoyed Patchett's The Dutch House narrated by Tom Hanks (although I think Mr. Hanks could make the ingredients on a shampoo bottle sound riveting), but I must admit, I liked the story line and characters of Commonwealth much better!Recommendation?If you like stories with well-developed characters, check out this book!"

22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365405-james,Rating 4 out of 5,"4 stars to Ann Patchett's Commonwealth. I chose this book because it was about drama and relationships within a complex family, as it seemed similar the last book I had written, and it was written in a way that I hoped would align with my favorite styles: from multiple character view points but with a focus via a single character. It did not disappoint and I am glad I read the book, but I don't think it was in my top favorite's list.
Story
The book is told mostly from the character of Franny Keating, but several chapters cover each of her 5 siblings (some biological, some step). Her parents divorced after her christening in the 1960s, when her mother began an affair with Franny's father's colleague. When the two later married, his 4 children, Franny and her sister shared a home for most of their remaining childhood years alternating between Virginia and California, living with each set of parents and new step-families. Chapters focus on different friendships and relationships, spanning 50 years of Franny's life until the parents pass away. Readers get to watch how each sibling interprets and experiences death, marriage, parenting, careers and general comfort with life. It's a great commentary on the everyday happenings of a family touched by different realities in the course of life. 
Strengths
1. Characters are vivid. With 4 parents, 6 children, countless spouses/partners and grandchildren, it's a lot to keep up with. The author does a great job at showing who is important and who isn't, which makes keeping track of everyone very easy. It's a very character-driven story with lots of plot elements along for the ride. 2. Writing is good. There are a few lengthy areas with great descriptions when they are needed, and dialogue is on point. You feel like you are there with the characters.
Suggestions
1. Dates were a little important in this book, but they were mostly left out. Typically, when you cover 50 years of the life of 15 major characters, each chapter would have a date and location so you can follow along easily. The author chose not to include dates and jumped around throughout the 50 year period. At times, it took a few minutes to determine what was happening and in which time period. I liked this a lot, as it was different than most books like this one, but it was a little frustrating at times as I felt like I only had a piece of the puzzle and wasn't even sure what I needed to know. It wasn't bad, just different -- and it may have been a little stronger with a little more structure in the how the book progressed.
Final Thoughts
It's a definite read for anyone who likes family dramas, books spanning lengthy time periods, watching what happens to characters over important periods in their life, but it's just 10 to 12 vignettes that are beautiful but don't tell the whole story. Then again, in life, we don't know the full story of all our friends, so this is like reading about an old friend. And that's a good thing in my book.

25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz,Rating 4 out of 5,"What a strange book. Parts made laugh, parts made me cringe, and other parts just had me saying OMG. Like the mother, who seeking revenge on her ex-husband, sends their four children across the country to him for the summer with no luggage. It all starts with a kiss at a christening party and the next thing you know, two families have dissolved and re-assembled . But there are huge gaps in the storyline, like how Bert and Beverly actually end up together.  You hear from each of the characters at various points in their lives. Some of them are more understandable or sympathetic than others. As an only child, I always find it fascinating how siblings can end up so different from each other. This books just reinforces that truth. Holly and Franny are one hundred eighty degrees apart, and the four Cousins kids are the four points of the compass. “The six children held in common one overarching principle that cast their potential dislike for one another down to the bottom of the minor leagues: they disliked their parents. They hated them.” And you can't blame them. The parents are all absentee parents. But one of the beauties of this book is how Patchett shows us how age smooths the edges. As adults, the kids have all pretty much accepted both natural and step parents. The writing, as always with Ann Patchett, is wonderful. The individual stories are wonderful. But the connection between the stories is often tenuous at best. At various stages, especially the first half, the book can feel very disjointed. I will say the book grew on me as it went on. By the end I appreciated how, in its own way, it came together. "

I felt indestructible.Well I have recently encountered 2 DNFs in as many weeks. I gave this one a damn good rattle though. Page 200. I have now lost all confidence. Almost petrified to pick up my next read. This was so tedious. I know it's supposed to be an intricate examination of modern family life. Step-families, kids, affairs, drugs, alcohol, resentments and the struggles of managing kids with step parents involved. I get that. But, as a 58 year old (old bastard) - who has been around the block a few times - nothing resonated with me. Nothing. Nil. Zilch. The characters were all aliens to me and some of the chapters went on endlessly. Particularly the scenes with the kids going bunta (....a South Australian word for nuts!) and getting into all sorts of trouble, also some of the bar scenes were mundane, almost idiotic. Nothing worked. Of this author's work I've read State of Wonder and Bel Canto and was disappointed by both. Particularly the latter which is one of the worst book's I've read. However, I've listened to Dutch House and gave a good score and I'm guessing that's because of Tom Hanks' narration. Perhaps.

It was my first novel by Ann Patchett, and throughout my reading of it I couldn't help but wonder how difficult the writing of this book must have been. That's because ""Commonwealth"" isn't written in chronological order. In fact, it starts in the middle of the story and proceeds to the ending of the story in chapter two. The rest of the book goes back and forth between the present, past and future, and you would think that that would make the book uninteresting and utterly spoiled. However, Ann Patchett is a talented story-teller because that is not the case! This novel just goes to show that even though you know how things end, that doesn't make the reading experience less of a pleasure. I loved ""Commonwealth"" for this feat and I admired the surprising structure as well as the beautiful storyline. This is a novel about family, destinies and life in general. It's one of those novels that questions the roads we take and how things could easily have ended up differently. It follows various families and characters, and it is thoroughly special and captivating throughout. I loved this book so much, and I'm definitely going to dive more into Ann Patchett's authorship in the new, upcoming year. "
29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,Rating 4 out of 5,"Previously I’d always preferred Patchett’s nonfiction to her fiction. However, this, for me, was much better than Bel Canto and State of Wonder. As a deep study of blended family dynamics, it reminded me of Jonathan Franzen, as well as 
This Must Be the Place
 (Maggie O’Farrell) and 
The Green Road
 (Anne Enright). Like those two, it shifts elegantly between times and places, often without any overt triggers like a date heading or a chapter break.It all starts with an early 1960s christening party Los Angeles policeman Fix Keating is throwing for his younger daughter, Franny. DA Bert Cousins turns up, uninvited, with a bottle of gin the grateful guests quickly polish off in their fresh-squeezed orange juice. He also kisses the hostess, sparking a chain of events that will rearrange the Keating and Cousins families in the decades to come. It’s a wonderfully Mad Men-esque opening sequence, never quite matched by what follows, although some later scenes with Franny come close.The novel spends time with all six step-siblings, but Franny is definitely the main character – and likely an autobiographical stand-in for Patchett (anyone familiar with This Is the Story of a Happy Marriage will recognize some particulars, like the L.A. cop scene). As a waitress in Chicago, she meets a famous novelist who’s in a slump; the story of her childhood gives him his next bestseller but forces the siblings to revisit a tragic accident they never fully faced up to. “We were such a fierce little tribe,” stepsister Holly remembers. It’s intriguing to see the different places life takes them, ranging from law school to a Buddhist center in Switzerland.This is a sophisticated and atmospheric novel I would not hesitate to recommend to literary fiction fans in general and Patchett fans in particular.

Bert Cousins, attends the party and finds himself attracted to Beverly despite the fact that she is married to his colleague, Fix. Bert and Beverly, share a kiss which serves as a catalyst in changing both their family’s lives.Bert and Beverly marry and move to Virginia. The book now focuses on the six children between the two families. During the summers, when the children and stepchildren are together, they develop a bond. We meet the family members at different times and at different ages allowing us to understand the family complexities. Because the parents are selfish, the children spend time together unsupervised. A tragedy occurs that breaks some of the relationships leading to a betrayal among the group. I enjoyed reading this book. I found the family relationships and descriptions realistic. The portrayal of the aging parents and the dilemma it created for the children felt very real. The author did an excellent job setting an antagonistic tone among the adults.

I had some difficulty remembering who was whose child and who married who from time to time but I sorted myself out. I enjoyed the different stories of the various characters and how they all came together by the end. However (and this is where it lost a star) did no one else feel that the author was having trouble winding the book up. She was still introducing characters in the last chapter at the Dinesons' Christmas party and I felt a little adrift and unsatisfied by the last page.However still an excellent book, lovely prose, well written characters. I enjoyed it and read it practically in one sitting."
32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri,Rating 4 out of 5,"Franny is one year old as this story begins; it’s her party, her christening party. She’s toddling around in diapers as their home is invaded by every cop in town, and all the associated characters, the booze is flowing, kids are playing everywhere, her mother, Beverly, is looking smashing in a sunny yellow dress, her beauty shining brightly enough that when Bert Cousins arrives, he’s blinded to everyone but her. In less time than it took Bert Cousins to drive there, he’s fallen in love, or at least some relation to it. Bert’s wife and four children are, for the moment oblivious to this, but not for long. In the timeframe of stories, it’s no time at all before Bert and Beverly pack up with her two and move across the country, from California to Virginia. Bert’s four children visit, during the summer months, and when all six are they, and they have a full house. Take a significant leap ahead in time to Franny, who is no longer toddling around in diapers, has dropped out of law school and is waitressing in a hotel bar, where she happens to meet one of her literary idols, and eventually they begin a friendship, which eventually becomes something more than just a friendship.  The major events and several notable events have these people, their families that were their families in their former lives and their to-be families included, in and out of each other’s lives for the whole of this book. And, while it may sound disjointed, this works. The attachments they have are for life, and you learn a little bit more about each life as their stories meander through time, wrapping their stories around the stories of all those people who touched their lives. They are family. The only other Patchett novel I’ve read is State of Wonder, this was a little easier to relate to since it’s about families, essentially. The bonds we form with those we share a good part of our lifetime with, the ones we love even when we don’t particularly like what they do. Published: 13 September 2016Many thanks to Harper, Edelweiss, and to author Ann Patchett for providing me with an advanced copy for reading and review."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars This was very close to being a 5-star read. There was no particular moment that kept it from being perfect for me, but overall I think that it's strength is also one of its weaknesses: Patchett spreads the story across so many characters (wonderful ones, though) that at times it can be a bit of a chore to keep track of everyone. And on top of that I felt like following 8+ MCs across the span of so many years kept me at the slightest distance from them. While I cared so much about their stories, I occasionally had trouble caring about the characters themselves.But enough about that because I want to focus on the positive stuff like the writing! Oh man, the writing in this is brilliant. There were many instances where I tabbed the book to save quotes I really liked which I don't make an effort to do too often while reading. I also thought, despite how many characters you had to keep up with, they all had interesting stories, motivations, personalities, etc. And to create such rich lives in such a small amount of time (around 33o pages) was impressive. Also as a Southern California native it was fun to read about the area and recognize places they visit or see in their daily lives. Overall this had pretty much everything I look for in a literary fiction novel. The ending lacked the bit of a punch I would've liked to really take this to the 5-star level, but that shouldn't dissuade people from reading this. And I can imagine that over time these characters will stay with me, and I will definitely be checking out Patchett's other works."
34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9827967-deb,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love this book. Ann Patchett has put the ""normal divorced family"" on a platter, stuck an apple in its mouth and presented it with all of the showmanship of a true performer- and bludgeoned the pretence while gently uncovering the deepest wounds. Commonwealth is tartly humorous, painfully straight faced, baldly tragic and a trifle optimistic. It is unbelievable how much destruction that one person can cause. One person who can act without consideration or any thought of the enormous consequences for all of the others as a result AND remain unscathed, untouched and detached from its carnage. That is this story. Bert kisses a woman who isn't his own wife. The ""why"" isn't really significant. But the aftermath is. The six children affected by the divorces eventually find themselves forming an alliance, during the legally mandated summer visitation by Bert Cousins. His ex-wife Teresa had fought hard to give him only two weeks, but he was a lawyer backed by his parents' wealth, and she lost. ""...she made a point to curse and weep, but she wondered silently if she hadn't just been handed the equivalent of a Caribbean vacation.""I smiled at that sentence. Yes, I was divorced and it was cruelly messy. The single week that my kids agreed to go with their father and his new partner, they were made to wait in the car as the couple antique shopped on the way to their uncle's home. Once they reached it, and headed camping with cousins and aunt and uncle as well as their father and partner, they were ignored by their dad. They realized that the whole point of the trip was to show his brother how wonderfully well everyone had adjusted, while the cousins bullied them and their father partied, and didn't intercede. I got a frantic pay phone call from them, but was unable to retrieve them due to the distance. They never stayed with their father again. He had my kids testify to the court, because from then on he said I was keeping them from him and influencing them. They were 15 and 12 at the time. I would have loved some time off. Estrangement engenders further estrangement. That is quite typical of a devastating divorce. Commonwealth documents the cracks that appear, the load of responsibility which children assume, the displaced anger, the stunned wonkiness of the grieving parents and the ways everyone tries to find their way as they grope, without the script, the promised roadmap, to some form of working peace. This novel is brilliant. I read it in one gulp, feeling it as I did so. The upheaval in the lives of the Cousin and Keating children, young and as adults is something I understand, and Patchett has framed it tenderly and sensitively. The search for connection - or the fear of becoming close - the damages of great loss- and comfort in mutual understanding - the long road after divorce - Patchett has written a truly wonderful, moving novel."
35,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24531548-betsy-hetzel,Rating 2 out of 5," I realize that this will be an unpopular review as other readers seem to love this book as I did not. Blame it on the fact that I am an only child and all the Keating/ Cousins siblings were just too confusing for me to keep straight. In the narrative, I didn't know at times who belongs to whom, what family they are part of and whose child is it ? Blame it on the fact that the time shifts added to my confusion. Told out-of-order, going back and forth, I was never sure that I knew where I was and with whom. I understand Patchett's purpose in children and blended families living amid divorce and reconstituted marriages, and that she was telling stories of how families remember life events and judge themselves accordingly but.... I didn't get close enough to any of the characters to really care about the evolution of their family as they moved forward; it just was a complicated story to me and not a very meaningful or satisfying one. Oh, my, I feel the barbs already :) A part that I did find interesting was that Franny had a 5 year affair/relationship with well-known author Leo Posen who ""used"" her family stories, especially the one about her deceased step-brother Cal, in HIS book COMMONWEALTH, which jump-started Posen's career once again as they even made a movie from the book. Franny's brother Albie was upset about this betrayal. To Franny he said, ""Did you think we were never going to see it? He took our life."" Franny was probably my favorite, IF I had a favorite; the others = Meh ! So sorry but so disappointed ! I will not give COMMONWEALTH another thought."
36,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51069187-marie,Rating 4 out of 5,"The opening scene is set up like artwork. You understand the background of the characters, the pace of their movements, the absurdity of their choices. You feel the heat of the summer day, understand the lives that the characters lead and the small town that they live in. You feel the music, the alcohol, the excitement, the dramatic turn of events that awaits. You feel some characters sliding out of focus while others are becoming more intensely illuminated even electrified. It’s as if a magic spell has been cast over the christening party with the the arrival of the handsome uninvited DA, his enormous bottle of liquor and love of oranges. The tension and magic builds feverishly until the kiss between Bert Cousins and Fix Keating's beautiful wife, Beverly.Commonwealth  starts out as a gorgeously written story about two families disrupted so casually, so brutally by this kiss at a christening party. The writing is so tight, so vivid, and the storyline is riveting. It follows the lives of the children and the parents in the aftermath of divorce. Each chapter is it’s own short story, jumping in space and time from the last. There are characters to love, to pity, to sympathize with, to worry about, to mourn for. The characters are all so human and the essence of humanity is explored through each of them.The chapters pertaining to the children growing up together, especially the ones taking place during the summer when all six children are together are astonishing. They are so well written and seem to contain so much truth. The amount of abandonment experienced by these children and hatred for their parents is astounding. The children were on their own to do as they pleased and Albie, the youngest, was the only thing holding them back. So, what did they do? They drugged him.Interestingly, this book is semi-autobiographical with many parallels to Ann Patchett’s life. She grew up in a blended Catholic family. Her father was a policeman. Then, there is a chapter about how Franny becomes Leo Posen’s muse. This writer basically manipulates Franny's life story into a novel, entitled Commonwealth, which is entirely her life and at the same time, not at all her life.This novel asks so many existential questions. How important is a moment in time? What would have happened if that one day had gone differently? Would the outcomes have been similar? What is important in the end? How does family shape us?As much as I adored the character development and the first three quarters of the novel, I must admit that some of the magic of it had departed by the end, for me. The characters were dispersed geographically and emotionally. As much as Ann Patchett gave me what I wanted in the end, which was an understanding of all the mysteries and a knowing of how each character of these two families fared in life, this part was far less interesting to me. Still, Ann Patchett is a brilliant, gifted writer and I was awed and amazed for at least the first three quarters of this book.For discussion questions, please see http://www.book-chatter.com/?p=816."
37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles,Rating 4 out of 5,"We love Ann Patchett for her novels, but her new one, “Commonwealth,” reminds us that, in another world, she could have been one of our favorite short story writers, too. When she edited “The Best American Short Stories” in 2006, she singled out Eudora Welty as “the hero of my life,” and that veneration shows in the adroitly shaped, exquisitely subtle scenes that make up her fiction.“Commonwealth” opens with a 32-page story about a party at Fix Keating’s house in Los Angeles. Fix is a policeman, and among the fellow cops and family members who come to celebrate the christening of his daughter Franny is a deputy DA named Bert Cousins, who crashes the party — with a bottle of gin — just to avoid going home to his suffocating wife and kids. As the afternoon wears on, we jumble through the crowd, spying guests and catching snippets of conversation. The narrator is transparent, but omniscient, recording the tremors running beneath the happy exterior of these people’s lives. Pay attention: This is a scene with hardly any apparent drama, yet it’s pregnant with implications that will roil two. . . .

It doesn't exactly have a plot, it is one of those books where you see how people's lives play out, you jump back to give context to something that didn't make sense before, and there's all kinds of little a-ha moments when things click together. Loyalties shift, stories change, characters grow. When I was nearly halfway through someone asked me what it was about and I answered, in all honesty, ""I'm not sure yet."" I'm still not quite sure, except that it's about its characters.The 6 step-siblings at the center of the book are so vivid, and I flipped back quickly to some of her nonfiction and quickly recognized it as drawing from Patchett's own childhood. Which explains a lot. This book is, in many ways, about what happens when you fictionalize a person's life, though that's really more of a sub-plot than the big picture. So here's what I have: it's almost impossible for me to tell you what it is about this book that's so intriguing. All I can tell you is that I couldn't stop reading it. I was immediately drawn in and read the entire second half of the novel in one sitting. I just kept coming back for more. There is something magical that Patchett does, even though this isn't one of her books set in an exotic locale, it just sucks you deep inside and leaves its footprints all over your brain when you're finished."

At this party, Bert meets Fix’s wife, Beverly, and a series of events that alters the course of the lives of two families and six children begins. If you have ever known a blended family, or been part of one, you will understand the relationships that form and break in this novel. Ann Patchett is a marvel at crafting characters that are relatable and real. She gives us people who feel so real that we know them in the space of a few pages. Even her lesser characters have depth and personality. Franny Keating and Albie Cousins are characters that I believe will remain in my mind for a long time, but I even felt an ability to identify with Fix Keating and Bert Cousins, who was not a very likable person. There are multiple themes running through the novel, but one of those that struck me as profound was that of action and consequence. Franny muses at one point about all the things in her life that would have been completely changed if Bert and Beverly had not met, if they had not divorced their spouses and if their children had not been tossed into a the melting pot of a common family. Some of the things that would have been changed might have been improvement, but at least one major event, she reflects, would have been missed and that would make it impossible for her to wish to change anything. Life is a sequence of events, and each of them impresses itself upon the next. Every choice we make in life impacts not only our lives but the infinite lives of others. [Can’t help thinking about a man who misses the plane that crashes because some stranger makes him late for his arrival at the airport.]I have another of Ann Patchett’s novels that has been sitting on a shelf for over a year. I keep reaching past it and picking up something else, but believe me the next time I go that shelf for a book hers will be the one I choose. Good work, Ms. Patchett."
40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine,Rating 4 out of 5,"4★First comes one of the best opening sentences in a story book one could hope for:“The christening party took a turn when Albert Cousins arrived with gin.”And there are plenty more where that came from because as most of her fans know, Ann Patchett can woo us with words.“…but sometimes all the right things are as useless as nothing at all. Life, Teresa knew by now, was a series of losses. It was other things too, better things, but the losses were as solid and dependable as the earth itself.”Amen to that.My reading experience was similar to when I read Jane Smiley’s A Thousand Acres because I can see my own family and history between the lines.There are fantastic professional and goodreads reviews out there that delve into why this is so special that a tongue-tied me cannot adequately convey. It’s one of those books that some of us may take quite personally to heart while others are left somewhat underwhelmed or befuddled by.I liked what author Curtis Sittenfeld wrote in her N.Y. Times review about Patchett recognizing “that the passage of time is actually the ultimate plot” and Annalisa Quinn’s insights for NPR: “Patchett shows that great drama isn't necessary. Guns and floods and fire and terrorists needn't kill us. Ordinary life will suffice.”I almost passed on this and now find myself pleased that I didn’t, although for me at least, it lacked the perfection of A Thousand Acres. Ordinary people like us getting through life on our own terms. But I'm left wondering—did she base that character on me???"
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7862560-la-canter,Rating 5 out of 5,"In 1960s Los Angeles, it wasn't just the burgeoning orange trees that were loaded. The story starts at the christening party of our main character Frannie. Guests hand-squeeze every juicy drop out of the fruit and douse it with gin that walked in with an uninvited guest. Kids grab the leftover glasses and sedated by booze, fall into easy naps. The priest knocks a few cups back and ends up dancing with the gal he will one day marry.A house full of friends and family and strangers brought together by something as simple as a christening celebration is a great microcosm of what this book is about. Who we love and who we spend our lives with sometimes relies on happenstance. But it doesn't mean that the love isn't real.My parents split up in the mid 1960s as did my husband's. Each of my parents remarried. My husband's father remarried twice, and each of those ladies had a child from an earlier marriage. When my father-in-law died at 56, his widow - wife number three - eventually remarried a wonderful widower with four grown kids of his own. I have step sisters. Step brothers. Blood sisters. My husband has an ex-step brother. A step-sister and a half-brother. He has four ""step-lings"" from his stepmother's third marriage. All of these assorted siblings have children (and some grandchildren) of their own.If our blended - no, pureed - family sounds a little bit like yours, then perhaps you'll identify closely with Ann Patchett's latest book. From the moment that an inappropriate, gin-soaked kiss gets planted at the mid 60s christening of baby Frannie, two divorces become imminent. Six step-brothers and step-sisters are destined to love each other, harm each other, and allow death to steal in way, way too soon. But the love is what is most important.Frannie, the christened baby, is the wheel around which most of the spokes of this story turn, but her four parents and her now-five siblings have their own roles to play. We see the tribe of the six kids running wild and free in their summers together, unsupervised as all of us were in those days. As the story flashes back and forth between present day and throughout the past, the role of chance (or fate) cannot be ignored.The first half of the tale clunked along a little bit for me. An unlikeable character doesn't usually turn me off on a book, but the parents aggravated me. The kids made some awful mistakes. The grown siblings later made life choices that in a zillion years you couldn't get me to relate to.I've loved the odd moments in all of this writer's novels and her wit is still intact here. An elderly woman welcomes her grandkids into her home in the midst of a huge party they knew nothing about, telling them to come in and stop standing on the porch like a bunch of Jehovah's witnesses. Another character, wracked with nervous anxiety has been plagued by night-time grinding of her teeth. When she proceeds to start chewing the insides of her cheeks, she goes to a doctor. Shows him her cheeks, explains about the teeth grinding. She hears him tell her: you are in need of some meditation. Meditation, she thinks! What an outstanding idea. Aloud, she muses...I wonder where I can learn how to meditate. The doc interrupts. MED-I-CATION. I said you are in need of MEDICATION. And writes her a script for Ativan. Instead, she joins a dojo.There are also some very poignant moments, particularly in the latter third of the book. In Chapter 8, a character envisions a lost loved one - a boy that died at 15. I lost a sister - a blood sister - at age 13, and I can tell you that the writing here - wrought so delicately - brought me to tears. Where this went five star and stayed there for me was a pivotal moment at the halfway point when a tall, skinny guy wearing a long black braid sits down in an all night laundromat and reads some book a local receptionist handed over to him. She works in a publishing house, and upon learning that he is from Virginia tells him to stay there at the reception desk for a minute. There is some new best seller out that is set in Virginia. She digs up and hands over a free copy of the book entitled  Commonwealth.As this young man opens its pages, he realizes that the book is the story of his life. It is the vaguely disguised biography of his parents and step parents and his siblings. He learns about things that happened to him when he was a preschooler that he never knew before. He reads exactly how his big brother - his only brother - died.The author who penned this life story is a big name guy. Huge. But the reader with the braid, Albie, has never met this writer - this writer who knows Albie's history better than he does himself.There's too much to tell from this point on, but suffice it to say that the siblings and step-siblings reconnect. One rather metafictional part that pleased me is that the well-known author appropriates the family history and makes a boatload of cash writing and selling it. Ann Patchett - in the real world - has parents that divorced when she was a kid. She has five siblings and steplings that she grew up with. In a mirror looking into a mirror sort of way, Ann Patchett is herself the old, hard-drinking author selling somebody else's stories. And the somebody else is her own family.When you read the acknowledgement, Patchett dedicates the book to some guy I've never heard of. It turns out that he is her step father. Actually, her FIRST step father. Like my family, there are many steps in hers - but if blood is thicker than water, love is stronger than blood. From my perspective, this was five stars. And six boxes of lobsters.For more about the story, here is Ann Patchett herself. https://www.theguardian.com/books/201..."

I thought this book would really interest me as it focuses on a kiss between two married strangers that changes their life, their children's life and their spouse's life. Their life was going one way and that decision to kiss a stranger changed everything so their life ended up going a completely different way. The story takes place over a few decades so we see exactly how that kiss changed everything. The main reason why I didn't mark this as a DNF was because I was interested enough to see whether anything good would come out of this book and I was interested to see what the repercussions of the kiss were. However when I finished reading this, I did wish I just didn't bother finishing it. The main problem I had with this book was the fact that it was so boring. I was bored for a good 98% of the time. I found things so tediously boring and the pace was so slow. There's really no better way to describe this book other than boring. I was waiting for the book to get interesting but it never did. At the end, I was left feeling very unsatisfied. Another problem I had was with the characters. I found most of them to be boring, unrelatable, irredeemable and/or unlikeable. They were also really hard to differentiate for a long time. I had a hard time keeping track of the children especially and the first chapter was a nightmare for me. I felt like there were too many characters and that they didn't add anything to the story. The writing didn't really impress me either, it just wasn't my preferred style. Although I didn't like this book, I gave it an extra half star because there was that element in the book made me keep reading. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I probably wouldn't read anything else by Ann Patchett either.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~“Half the things in this life I wish I could remember and the other half I wish I could forget.”“but sometimes all the right things are as useless as nothing at all.”"
43,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/697616-renata,Rating 5 out of 5,"Commonwealth, by Ann Patchett, is my new favorite book of the year. I’m ever so pleased I bought the book in hardcopy, even though that is completely against my rules (which I truly only break once or twice a year, mainly because my shelves are full to overflowing no matter how cleverly I try to rearrange my books, and…this is the clincher…for every new book I buy I must release an old one from the protected and cherished comforts of my home to the world at large. That is, IF I truly love and cherish this newcomer!). I have long been an ardent fan of Ann Patchett’s writing and I absolutely, unequivocally love this novel.Here it sits, with a colorful fringe of post-its marking places I noticed and wanted to return to. The story opens with such a dizzying mash-up of young family life that it was almost painfully funny for me to read. Bert Cousins, attorney, married and father of three young ones with number four on the way, is not sure he is up to the chaos of family life one Sunday and recalls a friend telling him of a Christening party. He manages to finagle attending while his beleaguered wife bandages kids and asks basic questions: She asked him if it was a baby boy or a girl, and if he had a present. The question was followed by a crash in the kitchen and a great clattering of metal mixing bowls. He hadn’t thought about a present. He went to the liquor cabinet and picked up a full bottle of gin. It was a big bottle, more than he wanted to give, but once he saw the seal was intact the matter was decided. That bottle of gin appears in different variations, like a leitmotif, throughout the book.Well, clearly desperate times call for desperate measures, but really? A bottle of gin to a Sunday afternoon christening party??? So begins the saga of two families that rearrange themselves to become two new families and all of the complications – both maddening, tedious, painful, and life changing – that accompany those changes. Patchett shifts her focus to the six children, mainly through the eyes and of one of the daughters, Franny, and how they navigate the upheavals in their life. She creates an exquisite balance of humor, outstanding characterization, and genuinely authentic sounding dialogue of both children at all ages, and adults in all circumstances. She has such a masterful ability to choose the right word to maximize the emotional shades of any situation. The novel is not presented chronologically and the stories interweave in a way I felt was very natural, natural for real life, how we revisit memories and experiences at different times depending on what else is happening. Every choice seems to lead to other choices, every choice causes unforeseen events and can rearrange how we are all connected, even in a family. The title Commonwealth takes on layers of meaning. The families form one commonwealth, a single unit organized for the common good of all its dependents. Are just the children dependents? Does this new organization meet the common good of all the adults as well? There is also the nesting box of stories: the stories the author tells us in the novel Commonwealth, the stories the characters tell each other, or refrain from telling, or tell in different ways, become a new common wealth. It’s a bit like when my brother and I get together to talk about childhood memories. I’m not always sure we grew up in the same family. The novel is full of the crazy things kids do, too. I was recently at the Memorial service of a close family friend. Her daughters and my brothers and I grew up together. Doris was recalling a time she and my brother were playing with matches on one of those long Sunday afternoons and spread butane fluid on their arms to burn off the hair. They were maybe ten? Where was I? I have no memory of that piece of madness. Never mind the memories I do have! But we have enough in common, and that common wealth unites us.There is so much I love about this novel. It is one to be read slowly, savoring what she reveals story by story about each character. It requires some relaxed mindful reading. I must admit, even though I wondered far into the book whether she was ever to tell me anything about several characters, she did not disappoint. The amazing for me was that when I read a paper book vs. an electronic book, I am such a cheater-pants about riffling ahead to see what happens next. I was not for a moment tempted to do that.  I just enjoyed the journey. I hope you do, too, because it is the very best kind of realistic fiction – authentic and recognizable and inspiring quiet pauses to reflect on your own relationships in life with siblings and parents. It is just such a beautiful book it will make you want to call everyone in our family and tell them you love them or share a few favorite stories. Because the book is also about losses. “…but sometimes all the right things are as useless as nothing at all. Life, Teresa knew by now, was a series of losses. It was other things, too, better things, but the losses were as dependable as the earth itself.” P 245Ok! Just one thing I loved and that was Patchett’s many references to what characters were reading. I just love literary references in books I read and I can’t help but think if the author mentions a book, then it must be one they treasure and so I feel just one tiny step closer to their creative mind! ""She had given him a copy of David Copperfield once and said she thought he’d like it, just like that, like he was the sort of person someone would look at and think of Dickens, and so he read it."" ""The flight from Los Angeles to Paris was twelve hours. Teresa accepted free wine whenever the cart rolled down the narrow aisle, slept fitfully against the window, ad tried to read The English Patient."" ""Waiting at the airport, “…wonder of wonders, a complete Tuesday edition of the New York Times. Suddenly she was soothed. The idea od spending three hours in the airport with newspapers and a Toblerone was nothing short of a miracle.” ""Franny credited her father’s time in law school for her reading David Copperfield, and Great Expectations, all of Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, and, eventually, The World According to Garp.Franny, on the other hand, was just now opening the hardback copy of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn from her grandmother. Even from the first sentence, from the look of the words on the page, she could tell that that was what she would be reading over Christmas vacation, not an LSAT prep book."""
44,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59357213-sam,Rating 4 out of 5,"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.While this famous Tolstoy quote doesn't grace the pages of Commowealth, it's a great way to open up discussion of Patchett's excellent family epic. I've had a good run with Ann Patchett: I read Bel Canto long ago and liked it, and read State of Wonder earlier this month and enjoyed that as well. So I was very excited for the release of Commonwealth, and once I cleared my slate eagerly dove in. Overall, I found it a quick read, easy to engage with, funny in a light, deft way and also in a laugh out loud way, and speaking to really universal ideas about how families form, break, reform; defined, destroyed, redefined. Patchett's prose, as you might expect, is gorgeous, neat, and sharply observed, but I love how light her hand is here, especially when comparing it to the claustrophobic, tense atmosphere she created in State of Wonder. She's really one of the more skillful writers I've read in terms of wielding various forms of her distinct style to work with the plot, tone, and characters of a given story.Two locations are the main settings - Virginia and Los Angeles. Two families are the focus of the novel - the Keatings and Cousins - and their fusion and dysfunction are captured over decades, stemming from two key events: a christening for young Franny Keating in which the beginning of the affair between Bert and Beverly sparks, and  the death of the oldest Cousin's child, Cal, and the fallout for the children and parents over time. Not all of the family members are entirely likable, and Patchett definitely presents with winning humor and sympathy the children's hatred and apathy toward Bert and Beverly as their lives are upended and somewhat haphazardly fused to one, not very Brady Bunch mixed family. The writing describing their summers together in Virginia is some of the book's best: the very differently expressed anger of Cal and Caroline, the zany, inexhaustible irreverence of Albie, Franny's sensitivity and Jeanette's withdrawal from the world and Holly's perfection and attention to detail, all are thoughtfully rendered and hilariously observed (especially in the case of Albie) in a single scene in which Beverly encounters each of the children in the house and ultimately longs to escape them all.The characters we spend the most time with and get acquainted with best are Fix and Franny. Fix is easily one of the best characters in Commonwealth, and one the reader is almost immediately on the side of since he's the left behind Los Angeles cop ex-husband of Beverly, but never loses his humor or his devotion to his daughters, and even aged and terminally ill, a man of sharp instincts and smart observations. Franny is a bit more of a cipher, and I never really got a fix on her character even though we follow her fairly closely and its her relationship with the author Leon ""Leo"" Posen that unites her blended family's past, present, and future, as this author mines the story of the affair and  Cal's death  for a bestselling novel that turns into at the end, a brand new movie. Albie is probably the next best covered, a scene-stealer of a child who becomes a somewhat delinquent juvenile to a quiet and solitary but caring adult.I wish we had had more of Cal and Caroline to show us more of the angry older Cousin and Keating children and their progression. Bert was not really likable except for a good scene with Franny near the conclusion, and Patchett gave us just enough of him to understand the source of the Cousin children's anger especially. Teresa was well drawn, and really evolved beyond what we first see of her from Bert's perspective: I loved the movie to hospital sequence with her, Caroline, Franny and Fix near the end. Beverly also remained somewhat enigmatic to me, but we did get a good view of her beauty and sophistication masking a restlessness and discomfort with her own life choices, which seems to follow her through her string of failed marriages and awkward relationships with her children and stepchildren.Ultimately, it is beautiful prose creating a portrait of two families across time, smart, funny, and occasionally sad. I heartily recommend this to fans of Anne Patchett and fans of contemporary fiction in general. "
45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have really liked Ann Patchett's novels, with Bel Canto being the first one I read (and my favorite until now). This one is my new favorite, and she'll have to work very hard to surpass it.It's the story of a messy family situation, (aren't they all), a divorce, a blended family, 4 parents, 6 kids, a tragic incident, and 55 years of stories and coping mechanisms. Patchett gives us the truth through the eyes of all the characters, showing us how the tiniest thing (a kiss at a christening party, for example) can set in motion a lifetime of change and regrets. By the end of this novel, I really liked all of these people, with a special shout out to Albie, the youngest child. What an annoying kid, confused teen-ager, sensitive adult, and unwitting victim of his siblings. But he made it through.For all Ann Patchett fans and first time readers, this one is a winner."
46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette,Rating 4 out of 5,"Before this review I have to make a declaration. From the get-go of the story, by page 50- the character Beverly- she sat full blown within my mind's eye. She became January Jones (Betty Draper of Mad Men) down to the minute details of half smile over the pearl strains. And never more during that scene of her and Bert in the kitchen during the opening Christening party with the baby Franny between their chests.Oh, Ann Patchett has another big winner here. Absolutely as big as Bel Canto or State of Wonder. Because serial monogamy is exactly where we are. In this age, it is far more common to be serial divorced, than to be serial widowed. This time she has taken the theme of the combined family, the step family, the sibling by re-marriage to a level of insight and reality that is rarely visited. And she does so without the pretension and/or condescension (always seeming to flip flop between those two) that is most common in the moderns that try to dwell there. Commonwealth is also missing the snark, politico sarcasms to grouping ""other"", and elevating dysfunction to a celebratory stage- that is moderns common in this genre for the last decade. In this one the characters may not always be ""nice"", but they are not either evil, nor are they purposed for their own full destruction. And there actually exists, in most, a trend to ""good intent"". This novel moves. It's extremely fast paced. And within a couple more chapters you are 20 years ahead before you know it. There is also some back story fill, regression in time, but it isn't done to extreme extent in the last half. But it was necessary. Because there are MANY characters and this gives a sense of their different perceptions of some of the same occurrences. For me, this novel was formed correctly. Easy to read and I read it in two hours, without a nary speed read. But then, I know combined family through experience and once you get the six kids straight and where they live- you've got the key to the door. The Cousins' house in Virginia (Commonwealth State) becomes for some years, the location in which all six are left for ""summer"" custody. Not everyone is going to connect with this multitude of characters. But by the end, I really ""knew"" at least a dozen. Most readers seem to desire an immense depth into two or three as protagonists. But Ann Patchett does not have to write tomes for you to ""get"" most of their cores. And personality reveals come out in actions as much as descriptions. IMHO, within this book she captured and cemented the souls of at least 10 different humans. For this length and number of location placements, that is an incredible ability that I seldom discern. Not in moderns of this length. And I read multitudes.Kudos to Ann Patchett. Before I had some mixed feelings about what I thought was rather uneven work. But after this one, I do not. She lives in Nashville, but I think she gets coastal Americans well- much better than the middle. It may be the economics? But she clearly knows the celeb and the wealthy associations classes well in context. Much less so the lower economics classes of Americans. Even her cocktail waitresses are only doing that kind of work for second jobs and always have other and better options. Don't we wish.No plot reveals in this review. Nor subject matter detailing. If you know large families, if you have step-brothers or step-sisters, if you have ever tossed a coin to see where you will go on a holiday, or argued with a spouse or friend over whose turn it is this year- READ THIS BOOK. Also Patchett has not just let us know about the ""good"" years but also about the ending years. The fast death, the slow death, the single for 50 years and yet mother of four- her death. Lastly I could share in long length but I'll just post this. I have had my own and LARGE graduation, Christening, Christmas, Wedding parties that become similar- but most of those about twice a decade. Yet I have a Thanksgiving every single year which holds somewhere between 50 and 70 people and is ever ongoing, a tradition- no one has even asked about a change for over 30 years. (And at least half know exactly what to bring also.) It's all people who are some relation by blood or married-in association entirely. At the most 4 or 5 loose for the day friends or students who ended up in the wrong city are in the mix, but they are greatly in minority. And most people come from far by automobile. And we have a set of associated kids, just like the six in this book. They aren't my grandchildren but they are all nephews or nephews' kids (grand-nieces to me). And many of those only have one parent in this holiday picture. And there are ex-wives and some ex-husbands in evidence every year too. The husband of my youth has attended for 40 years, no 45. So some of these scenes truly did make me laugh. And having a cabin by the water, Franny's situation with her writer! Did that connect! I can still remember a day when a dear friend asked me with a straight face (while I was fishing from a pier in a bathing suit)- if I could find a pastry brush for her. Yes, that's true.So I do get how these bonds do occur and what kinds of situations arise. And am super glad that Ann Patchett focused on the theme she did for this one. And with grown kids moving far for jobs, and then again, and again- it's majority of us for these years' generations.If you have ever hosted a step-child, foster kid, sent your kids on a plane to his/her father or have been the one to take them off, laughed (secretly to yourself) at the terrible wash load or food shopping the second or third wife was landed with for months when you know ""he"" will never raise a finger to help- this is the book for you."
47,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have a love/hate relationship with Ann Patchett. Her novel, Bel Canto, remains one of my all-time contemporary favorites. State of Wonder left me cold with some of the plot and character implausabilities. So I came to Commonweath with few expectations. I knew I could love it, hate it, or anything in between.And how did I pan out? I think it’s quite good – not as good as Bel Canto but good, nonetheless. The book is ambitious in scope, spanning five decades that radiate out from Franny Keating’s christening party, when an unexpected guest, Bert Cousins, kisses Franny’s mother. The action results in a messy life, composed of a divorce, ensuing marriages, children, grandchildren. Or, as Ann Patchett writes, “…all the ways the future would unravel without the moorings of the past.”If there’s a grand theme in this novel, it’s this: who owns the stories that compose a life? Would one action or one omission cause life to rear in a different direction? What is public and what do we keep to ourselves?As the book jacket reveals, Franny, in her 20s, begins an affair with the famous and much-older author Leo Posen, who uses these stories to get himself out of the doldrums and write a highly popular book. Surprisingly to me, that incident gets short shrift. But I suspect that this is precisely Ann Patchett’s point: the characters in the book are just that – characters- and not the real life family. No one can truly own those stories but the Keatings and the Cousins. Ann Patchett is a compulsively good writer and the story carried me along with its equal measures of humor and poignancy. It’s not an easy task to balance decades of living, a number of characters, and emotional shifts, and in truth, not all the scenes work equally well. The opening seduction is a stunner and just about every scene pulls the reader in. I’d rate this toward the top of the Ann Patchett books I’ve read – and I’ve read many of them. 4.5,"

The book concerns two families whose worlds are seriously disrupted when wife from marriage # 1 gets together with husband from marriage # 2. People suffer, struggle, grow, do bad things, get into and out of relationships, hurt one another and makeup. My problem was that I found the characters easily confused with one another and I did not really care for any of the them. It is hard to like a book if there is no one you can root for. "

I'm just very glad that I finally got to her. A stunning characterization of a diverse family spanning generations.It all begins with a Christening party and a bottle of gin. A man kisses a gorgeous woman and just like that two households are upended and so begins this book. Two families- the Cousins' and the Keatings' grow up together and apart, taken cross country and built in memories and personalities to keep the reader interested. I enjoyed the nuances of the relationships as they developed into more little storylines that pushed the book onward. I especially enjoyed Franny Keating and her relationship with Leon- how the book became a movie became a book (this one), that was interesting and relevant. Fix Keating was my very favorite character- strong and resilient and reminding me slightly of the irreverent Atticus Finch. The writing was fluid and descriptive and managed to give me all the feels while building slowly through the book. I was overjoyed to see more small surprises than I had anticipated while reading a standard character study novel. I loved reading about the darkness in this family- the secrets, the habits, and personalities that changed. I loved how the children grew up into very clear adults with goals and ambitions that were sharp and direct. One that I would recommend for readers who enjoy literary fiction novels about complicated families."

51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34622220-seemita,Rating 3 out of 5,"[Originally appeared here (with edits): http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/li...][A strong 3.5]How does a car-ride feel across a long, stretched road? Bumpy? Restless? Exhilarating? Tiresome? While a whole bunch of elements might prompt us to arrive at one or many words, there is, perhaps, a single word that can bring the responses of most of us onto a common plain – unforgettable.Ann Patchett takes us on one such ride. In Commonwealth, she takes two families and follows their six children across a time span of 50 odd years. When Beverly Keating chooses to marry Bert Cousins, walking away from her husband, Fix and two daughters, Caroline and Franny, she is resolute in staying connected to her girls. Bert, on his part, shares a similar sentiment for his four children, Cal, Holly, Jeannette and Albie. But six growing children with untamed streams of inquisitiveness and opinions prove more than handful for the parents. It is their estranged dreams, shared failures, collective successes, rigid silences, futile questions and mismatched lives that form the crux of this novel.During the early parts of the novel, the pages moved with a burden on their bodies; the noticeably lax pace almost reflected a tired family that was compelled to drag itself into the act, being devoid of interest in the ride. The ride was, thus, just dragging along. But it wasn't without the occasional spotting of coruscating life:
Prosecutors should insist the trials of murderers and drug lords be held in economy class on crowded transatlantic flights, where any suspect would confess to any crime in exchange for the promise of a soft bed in a dark, quiet room.
 Like the cacophony of a garrulous bunch of kids, too many characters were vying for the chisel in the author’s hands and consequently, appeared rough and flustered. But towards the second half, the narrative surreptitiously came together, almost like how a journey makes so much more sense when it comes full circle. The discreet pull between siblings, even step-siblings, finds a tender meaning when expressed in the deep-seeped delicate and measured prose of the author and the conversations carry an endearing warmth of their own. Patchett does a masterly job in depicting the ease of embracing pain that invariably is a legacy of ripe age. From heartaches to aimlessness, from reunion to illness, the families have a real fabric to them which make them spring out from the book and nestle next to us. It may not be wrong to say that this book is a subtle song about the many colours of a ‘family’ and how it continues to reflect crimson and grey skies around our existences despite the many whirlwinds of time.When the drive finally ended after multiple deviations, maneauvered by the many drivers of the Keating and Cousins family, accommodating many lift-takers, there was a sense of contentment; not the one which sets the heart at ease and brings the feet to rest but the kind that thanks for a largely memorable ride, despite the many thorns that continue to stare from the punctured tyres."

Commonwealth isn't going to be that novel, but instead of sending me to the moon, I'll be satisfied with her sending me to Downey and Torrance (two Los Angeles-centric bedroom communities that bring me back to my childhood, and, I'm willing to bet, Ms. Patchett's childhood too.)Oh Downey (and Torrance): not exactly towns to wax rhapsodic about today, but in the 1960's these orange tree-redolent suburbs were  the places for people like Bert Cousins (a lawyer working for the LA County District Attorney's Office) and Francis Xavier 'Fix' Keating (a detective with the LAPD) to plunk down in LA and live the American Dream. Mini west-coast ""Coplands"" of backyard barbecues and court/perp shop-talk, and alcohol providing the excuse for even the most mundane excuses for parties (like child christenings, for example). The dalliances at Franny's (Fix Keating's daughter's) Downey Christening party provide the germination for a 5 decade-long, non-linear, near-epic in feel (if not in length) blended family saga that spans the width of the US (from Southern California to Chicago, Illinois, to the Commonwealth of Virginia.) I must say, once I saw the direction this book was headed, I was not terribly eager to continue reading. (I'm no prude or moralist, but books that feature marital infidelity as their core dramatic linchpin generally get no love from me.) Kudos to Ms. Patchett, though, for taking my least favorite subject and blooming it into something rather fascinating. And it  really helped to have read a few of her essays from ...Happy Marriage before reading this: You know that much of this novel has to be autobiographical, which makes it sparkle and resonate much brighter than its tawdry subject matter. I especially appreciate Ms. Patchett's focus on the six Cousins and Keating children (casualties of the bi-coastal polar-opposite-of-the-Brady-Bunch family swap) as it's really, ultimately,  their story to be told (and she does an outstanding job portraying their plights). Really, I had very few complaints with this unconventional (for her, anyway) Patchett novel. No moon trip (or navigating the Amazon), but this trip down (her and my) memory lane(s) ultimately exceeded my expectations."

The writing, character development and story line were, in my opinion, superb, and I was always anxious to get back to the story whenever I had to stop reading. I'd say the primary focus of this story centers on relationships, those between siblings and step-siblings, and the parents of each. The book takes place over many years, starting out when the siblings/step-siblings are children and following them into their adult years. The way they relate to each other, and time and place shapes them into characters that I would love to know in my real life. It also brings to mind how intertwined events are and has a domino effect on our own lives and others as well. Toward the book's end, the character of Franny reflects on this beautifully. I can't say there was anything in this book that disappointed me, other than it had to end. I was very satisfied with the entire story, and the end came full circle for me. This is a book I was happy to read as a joint read so that we could discuss it. Just a perfect book, in my opinion. If you read it, I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.

Patchett writes very well about sibling relationships. The story is told in nine long chapters, and there are many time-shifts and changes of perspective, some of them in mid-chapter, so it is not a simple linear story, and at times the different characters' perspectives bring new aspects to light on stories that have already been partially told. There is also a meta element to the plot - one of the main protagonists Frannie has an affair with a novelist who uses her story as a basis for a novel, also called Commonwealth, which sounds very much like this one, which inevitably causes friction with her siblings.

So begins the narrative of the lives of the two families. The story meanders through the many instances of family tradgedy and occasional triumphs.

Patchett’s new novel is about a blended family, mostly from the children’s point of view. Like “Bel Canto”, the characters are forced in captivity(this time in a blended family) that is not of their making or liking.Patchett tells her story in chapters that are not linear in time. Each chapter is character based with the story of the blended family articulated from each character’s point of view. The story begins at a Christening, with a handsome DA crashing a LA cop’s daughter’s christening. This baby is the second baby of the cop’s family. The DA, Bert Cousins, decided to crash the Christening to escape the insanity of his own household of three toddlers and a pregnant wife. Bert see’s the beautiful wife, Beverly, of the Cop Fix, and he decides he must have her. Fast-forward, and Beverly and Bert get married. Part of the divorce agreement is that Bert gets his four children in the summer. This is in the 1970’s, and the beautiful Beverly is not emotionally equipped to monitor six children; nor is Bert particularly interested in playing the role of Ward Cleaver. As a result, the six children are left to their own devices. These stories are the best. In fact, the novel is told in stories, as one would do if you asked someone about your family. There’s no plot to your family history. There are only stories, and stories told from your own perspective. Of course Patchett needs to add trauma to make the novel interesting, and in one summer, the oldest boy of Bert dies in a field, while the children played unattended by adults. It is in this trauma, that defines each of the remaining five children’s lives.To add to this trauma, the youngest daughter, Frannie, falls for a washed up novelist who hijacks her family stories and writes a highly acclaimed and notable novel. Because the novel is out there, the children, now adults, must come to terms of their shared history.What I enjoyed is that Patchett wrote the children fairly realistically in that they were angry. What was interesting is that she wrote them as mostly angry at their parents, and not at each other. Yes, the children fought one another, as children do. But their shared anger was with the adults in their lives. I’m not sure if that’s realistic, as I’m sure there are far more blended families with serious jealousy issues. Because all children were treated similarly, and across the board neglected, no one stood out as the favored child. Therefore, they became a pack of children who are forced together, similar to school children who are forced to get along.Read this novel simply because Ann Patchett is a great novelist, one of the best of our times. Read this novel because it’s a cultural study of blended families. Read this novel because it’s a beautiful story of forgiveness and coming to terms with the past. It’s a beautiful story and novel. "

While it’s been compared to The Children’s Crusade, the only way that I found this to be true is in the plot line’s design relating a family’s history across time. I found both family portraits intriguing, but Patchett’s storytelling is a thing to behold.Who but a master at her craft can show us the drama unfolding line by simple line never beating us over the head with the telling? She weaves the past and present into the narrative so seamlessly, so spectacularly, that you are transported back and forth without ever missing a beat, there is never a hard stop that abruptly pulls you out and I would have happily spent another 100 pages (or more) with this family.I can’t say more about this novel without treading over already stated territory, you really just have to experience it. I had the great fortune to see her speak at an event for the release of this book and she is as engaging a storyteller in person as in her writing. If this still doesn’t convince you to read it, I refer you to Larry Hoffer's beauty in words, a comprehensive and persuasive review."

She had needed to keep something for herself. ❤️3.5 ratingAnn Patchett is a master storyteller of generational family stories. This is the second novel I've read by her. It's very comforting, funny at times, and an honest betrayal of familial bonds. Commonwealth tells the story of two families who were united together at a baby Christening party. Spanning five decades, this book explores how this chance encounter blends four parents and six kids together for life. When one of the daughters, Franny, tells a famous author about her childhood experiences, he decides to write a book about it. The book forces the family to come to terms with their losses, guilt, and connection with one another.*For those who enjoyed this story, I also recommend Daphne du Maurier's, The Loving Spirit. It's written in the same style as this novel and just as lovely.**"

The characters are revealed at different times and places throughout their lives over a time span of 50 years.I loved the pacing of the story. Events are revealed in due time. Somehow along the way, I started to care about these people - every one of them. How did that happen? They grew on me. Like real life.I loved the flow of the story. No stumbling over weird words or complicated odd passages. It flowed so naturally and beautifully that I didn't notice the words - only the feelings. And the feelings are real and personal.

A meditation on inspiration, interpretation and the ownership of stories, it is Ann Patchett's most astonishing work to date. I won't call it a powerful or astonishing experience, but certainly a very good one, after State of Wonder.Not only the christening party took a turn when Albert Cousins arrived with gin. Uninvited. Wandering. He was the man. Yes, the axle-swinger of a common wealth of events. The bottle of gin was after all big. Fix brought the tonic, but Bert preferred the orange juice that Beverley was making from a mountain of oranges on the kitchen table ...A blended family consisting of four parents and six children between them, share a lifetime of entitlement, dysfunction and regret.CharactersFix and Beverley Keating, with their two daughters, Caroline and Franny.Bert and Teresa Cousins, with their four children, Cal, Holly, Jeanette and Albie.Six children with six different personalities walk the journey together through several decades. Their love for their parents, borne from dependency as kids, turned into a passionate communal hatred for all four parental trendsetters in their lives, and end up in a compassionate sincere love of the gene-donors they had no other choice but call parents. And then there was forgiveness ...As young adults they scattered all over the land, adding a continent here and there, gathering a commonwealth of people along the way, but was forced to confront their history and unfinished emotional journeys when they lose control over their story.In the end ...well, that was the beauty of this book: everything made sense and life was as good as it could get. A commonwealth of emotions and people were left behind when the final words were written.I absolutely loved everything about this book. Apart from the constellation of characters, which often left me confused and forced to concentrate more, the atmosphere and prose captured the attention. Near to the end even more characters were added as peripheral details, but the experience remained good. Great, in fact. RECOMMENDED"
68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8575414-emma,Rating 5 out of 5,"I loved this book-put life on hold and soaked it up almost in one go!It's the story of a family constellation- and tells stories from different perspectives and different times over the course of about 50 years. This way of handling the time line and perspective is what I found so good. After reading the first chapter I wasn't actually that sold, but as soon as I realised the next chapter involved a big jump in time, I was suddenly invested.The most important message to me was that the small stuff of life, that we get so bogged down by, really doesn't matter so much in the long term. Life painted in broad strokes gives a much clearer picture of the whole. Another important theme is that people aren't perfect and life goes on. Patchett makes many astute observations about people and life : I found myself nodding along and agreeing with her on many occasions.This was my first Ann Patchett novel so I'm very excited to have a whole backlog of her books to work through."

I had not read any of Ann Patchett's books before but after this I'd definitely read more - I've had a few on my To-Read list for awhile. It took me a little while to keep all of the characters straight - between the 2 families there were 6 kids & 4 parents and as the story continues, additional characters surface. I liked that the book gave perspective from many of the family members - both in current day and the past, and the shift between them was easy to read. It was sad at parts but also enjoyable throughout the whole story."

71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3423721-darlene,Rating 4 out of 5,"Two families collide and make the best of it for the next 50 years in this blended-family saga. When Deputy District Attorney, Bert Cousins shows up at LAPD office Fix Keating's house uninvited for his daughter's christening party, he changes the trajectory for both families. He drunkenly kisses Fix's wife, Beverly, and begins an affair that ends two marriages and forever and throws their children together into one big dysfunctional, blended family. This one betrayal ignites a chain of events that leave irremediable scars on both families.Having read two other of Pachett's novels, I knew this would be a very character-centric story and it was. Though there are a lot of characters that hold equal weight in the book, I feel I got to know all of them well. She took me on a five-decade journey through their lives and left very little out. The book did a good job of exploring the families' trials through the eyes of every family member involved and that was the point. The author connects all the dots and shows how the events affected everyone.Though the characters are always the highlight for me, I would have enjoyed this book more if there were more of a plot holding the whole thing together. Though there are several subplots, there is no discernable story arc. I like being able to mark a clear beginning, middle, and end and you just cannot do that with this book.Readers should note that there is some potentially offensive content in this book in the form of drug use, extramarital affairs, violence, child neglect, and child endangerment.The great strength of this book was how it revealed the consequences of everyone's actions on the other family members. It felt like such a web of treachery. Bert and Beverly's affair and eventual marriage may have been the launch point, but the children made a lot of bad choices, as children do, that had huge effects on their siblings and step-siblings. Albie, the youngest of the siblings, was prone to annoying his brothers and sisters, so he would either be the object of their pranks or be abandoned by the other siblings so he turned to causing trouble in the neighborhood with a gang of preteen miscreants. ""People simultaneously wanted to kill them, believed they had almost killed them, and were afraid of being killed by them. . . They had all started riding together when they were eleven and ten when they were still just irritating boys whose mothers wanted them out of the house in the afternoon.""The prose is beautiful and provokes a fervor of emotion. There were moments when I was so angry at some of the characters and other moments of profound grief. Albie really tugged at me and, with all his poor decisions, I just really wanted him to turn his life around. Franny really resonated with me as well. I love strong, female characters and I really saw a strength of will in her.Commonwealth is not likely to be one of my most recommended books this year, but I think it has a lot of merit and I will read more by this author."
72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb,Rating 4 out of 5,"Maybe even a 4.5. I loved the opening sentence: ""The christening party took a turn when Albert Cousins arrived with gin."" Which is an understatement. That one random event set in motion consequences that spanned 50 years and deeply affected two families. This is a beautifully written book about a messy blended family, the Cousins and the Keatings. With a divorce and remarriage, the six children from the two families end up sharing their summers. As was fairly typical in the 1960s, they spend their days unsupervised. They get into all kinds of adventures and a tragedy changes the course of their lives. The book revolves around the now adult children looking back. I loved hearing from all the children, the family stories, and the differing perspectives. I could relate to how siblings remember the same event differently.Dysfunctional family sagas is my favorite genre and this one delivers. There's drama and tragedy, love and forgiveness, family secrets and stories, sickness and aging. All of these themes are explored with poignancy, subtlety and wit. The beginning is a little confusing with a large cast of characters. The time line and POV jumps around from chapter to chapter so you have to pay close attention. A family tree would have been helpful but it wasn't long before I figured out who was who. If you like a linear story line this isn't the book for you. It does make the audio a little challenging in the beginning but the narrator was excellent and I would highly recommend it. "

I decided to read all the books! I can't help it, I get reading envy. It explains a lot.I've had mixed experiences with Ann Patchett but I always believe I will love her, and the basic story behind this (a kiss changes everything between two families) was intriguing. But yet I circled it for a while. I knew the audio was available in Hoopla so I downloaded it. As with many audio experiences, I am not sure I caught everything. I'm looking forward to discussing this with a podcast guest because I think her insights might help. I think it might be a four-star read.Part of my confusion is the timeline. The party at the beginning then jumps elsewhere and particularly in audio I found it difficult to unravel. As character names grew more familiar, I was able to follow better as their ages changed. It seems like the whole point in the end is that there is family and then there is the family you choose and love, whether you are split up, step family, hurt, forgiven, etc. It's not a bad message, but somehow it also wasn't quite what I was expecting.And I really want orange juice."

This felt to me like the first sentence Patchett wrote, in the very first draft, because it's such an echo of Mrs. Dalloway's opening, the kind of sentence that will be what a writer will grab first when beginning a new novel. But this opening party scene is so not Mrs. Dalloway, and it's so not ""The Dead,"" and it's so not even Bel Canto. Instead, the writing feels like stirring-the-pot prose. The story feels like it drifts. But it could also be that it's all just too subtle for the reading mood I'm in."

Commonwealth
 by Ann Patchett delves into the intricacies of family dynamics, portraying the complexities of relationships and the imperfections beneath seemingly perfect exteriors. Patchett's power lies in her ability to immerse readers into the lives of her characters, allowing them to empathize with their struggles and conflicts. Through her storytelling, Patchett highlights the prevalence of dysfunction within families and emphasizes the beauty and resilience that can emerge from such imperfections. The novel takes its time to unravel the layers of each character, revealing the depth of their emotions and the impact of their choices on both themselves and their loved ones. I will say the time jumps can be initially confusing; however, as you immerse yourself in the narrative, you gradually acclimate to the structure and gain a deeper understanding of the interconnected lives portrayed in the story. Despite the occasional confusion, the time jumps enrich the storytelling and allow a nuanced exploration of the characters' pasts and presents. Among the siblings, I found myself particularly intrigued by Franny and Albie's narratives. Their experiences and character development drew me in more than the other siblings. On the other hand, Bert struck me as very self-centred, with his actions and motivations often revolving around his desires and interests rather than considering the needs of others - particularly his children. 💜|| 𝐐𝐮𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐬 ||💜For the vast majority of the people on this planet, the thing that's going to kill them is already on the inside.I only wanted to be a reader.

76,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30444249-malcolm,Rating 5 out of 5,"Not a thriller, but there are thrills. Not a mystery, but there are secrets to discover. Simply an engaging, well written story of a family, not what I would call disfunctional, but certainly complicated. Not so far removed from families everywhere. When Asst. DA Bert Cousins hears about a christening party at the home of Fix and Beverly Keating, he decides to crash the party. Bert and his wife Shirley have three children with a fourth on the way, but for some reason, he wants to get away and, hence, becomes the gate crasher. Before the night is over however, he has kissed and fallen in love with the stunningly beautiful Beverly Keating. Before long, Bert has left Shirley with their four children and married Beverly with her two and the have moved across country to Virginia. Over the next forty years, as the six siblings grow into adulthood and their parents move on to other relationships, we see the far reaching effects of that kiss at the party. There is hate, but also love; there are mistakes in judgement, but also reconciliation with the consequences. Over time, we learn about each of the major characters, as well has a host of minor ones. Each have their flaws, but they are all, in one way or another, likable individuals. Like I said, complicated. But highly entertaining. Certainly one of the best books to appear this year."

Her writing style is distant and cold, she has too many characters, and she concentrates on the smallest details (that I would happily skip to get to the more interesting stuff). Small details make the picture, but you can also lose the forest for the trees.I acknowledge Patchett's great ability to write and describe situations, and there were parts in this book (and in Bel Canto) that I enjoyed immensely. But overall, it is far from being my favorite. I am most of the time voting for the forest.Franny can be described as the main character. Her meeting with her lover, a famous novelist, Leo Posen, is one of the best scenes in the book (and by the way, almost every time he is mentioned in the book he is mentioned as Leo Posen, and very very few times just Leo, which is kind of strange imo). Her childhood story is the basis of a bestseller that Leo (Posen!) writes, but it awakes daemons from the past. The family needs to face a tragedy that was never fully digested, that happened when the children were left unsupervised.  Because of the writing style, even when terrible things happen, I didn't find myself feeling either fear or great surprise. Patchett is a very slow cooker, she portrays a detailed picture, but it is more like a picture of a very realistic view or a landscape, it can be breathtaking, but hardly revolutionary, scary or surprising.Sophisticated writing with a lot of atmosphere, but too slow and can be described as literary. I can't promise to read the next Patchett's book. 3 stars."

This has a LOT of elements in it which normally drive me bonkers: a non-chronological time frame that bounces back and forth; a lot of 'meta' elements (the main story becomes both a novel within the novel, and later a film based on said novel); way too many characters to keep everyone and their relationships straight ... and yet - it all works BEAUTIFULLY!!! At times it reminded me of Tom Perrotta's 'Little Children', at other times the best of Salinger (I don't think it is entirely coincidental a major character is named Franny), but Patchett's imagination and control of her material is all her own. Will surely make my top five list of best books I'll have read in 2017."

I liked the complicated dysfunctional family Patchett portrayed and enjoyed following the lives of the six children impacted by their unconventional upbringing.What I did not enjoy was the the narrator's attempt at men's voices, but particularly the different accents - namely West African and Indian really bothered me. I found them over the top and caricaturish, making me cringe. It is a shame as the 'normal' voice of the narrator was pleasant."

First I was expecting it and its big cast of characters to confuse the heck out of me, based on a few reviews I had read. But it really didn't. Not at all. Maybe I just simply paid extra close attention during those beginning chapters and I quickly became involved in it all, with all of them, the two sets of parents, two who would switch partners, and the six total kids between them. Those kids, like a tribe whenever they got together, were on the edge of getting into trouble all the time, on the edge of being edgy, and then not so much. Oh, things happened all right, a couple of tragedies even, but I sort of felt like the story would lead to more than it did. They were all a bit weird too, and definitely dysfunctional. I did love that books and reading and authoring played such a big part in Franny's sections. I think the first half was 4 stars and the second half 3, and when I reached the last page I actually said ""That's it?"" So a 3.5 rating, and I do recommend it for Patchett fans."

However, the one topic she's shied away from is her family, worried that public exposure of family stories and secrets would hurt and anger some members. Then, on her 50th birthday, she woke up and the good little Catholic girl she'd always been had finally grown to realize she didn't care. She felt as if she'd been trying to hold a beachball under water, subsuming that part of her life.

The Cousin and Keating families are close as can be, spending time and partying together on weekends. Then, something happens that changes the course of these families lives forever: Bert Cousins falls for Beverly Keating - both of whom are already married to other people. Thereafter, two families become one, joining four children from one marriage and two from another. And more often than not, the kids, Cal, Caroline, Jeanette, Frannie, Holly and Albie are left to fend for themselves, with their parents never giving them a second thought, in essence letting their children run amok, for which in my opinion there was no excuse. Was this a sign of the times or was this a sign of neglect, plain and simple? I asked myself this question over and over, with my temperature rising and my heart beating faster and faster, my emotions running at an all-time high. That said - neglect is of course the answer, though I do think this happened more often than not in this generation.This is a family who has gone through various trials and tribulations through the course of their lives - including marriage, divorce and of course death. They have experienced a deep sense of loss and even betrayal and though the dysfunction runs deep, somehow it doesn’t break this family apart. For the Cousin and Keating children are resilient, as they have basically raised themselves. And though the family becomes distant over the years, they do not lose their bond to each other.Commonwealth spans over the course of 50 years, and is told mostly from the perspective of Frannie Keating, though several of the other children and parent’s perspectives are also featured. The time frame jumps around during the book and was at times hard to follow, as was the structure of the story, especially when the family’s life was portrayed in different mediums (hence the reason for the 4 v. 5 star rating). The characters are vividly written by Ann Patchett - some are bold, some intense, some cold, some withdrawn and encompass a family masterfully.Parenting styles and/or the lack there-of, and the neglect that went along with it, hit a nerve for me when listening to Ann Patchett’s Commonwealth and yet I couldn’t tear myself away (and I’m guessing I’m not the only one who felt this way). However, the strength of this family, their ability to endure and their love for each other, though misplaced it maybe have been, was brilliantly depicted and at times defied logic.All in all, I found Commonwealth to be a complicated and intriguing characterization of a truly dysfunctional family, though it angered me and made my blood boil on multiple occasions. Further, the narrator of the audiobook did a stellar job and made the listening experience enjoyable. Strongly recommended.Published on Goodreads and Amazon on 5.12.17."

Ann Patchett writes brilliantly about a family torn apart by divorce and put back together in some sort of sloppy mess and the effect this shake-up has on those families, most especially on the six children involved. Bert Cousins is the uninvited guest at the christening party for baby Franny Keating. He brings along a huge bottle of gin as his gift...which changes the course of the party, as everyone gets drunk. Bert gets one look at Beverly, the beautiful mother of the newly christened baby plusanother young daughter Caroline, and falls in lust...even though he has a wife and 3.5 children of his own. Beverly is also smitten and eventually they leave their respective spouses behind to marry each other. Bert and Beverly move from LA to Virginia but things are not happy in paradise. Bert fights to have custody of his four kids each summer but then makes every effort to bury himself in work, leaving poor Beverly to deal as best she can with this horde of annoying kids (Calgon, please take me away!!) Left often to their own devices, the kids do crazy things like giving their youngest sibling Albie some Benadryl, telling him they are Tic Tacs, so he'll fall asleep and leave the older kids to their fun. Why do they have Benadryl? The answer to that leads to an interesting twist of fate.The narrative of their lives is not told in a straight timeline but circles around and back in a complicated narrative that takes a bit of getting used to. I would still say that Franny is the central character. As a young adult, we find that she has dropped out of law school and works as a barmaid in the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago. There she meets her favorite author, Leon Posen, who hasn't published anything new in years. They begin an affair, even though he is decades older, and she tells him the story of her messed up family which he then turns into a best-selling novel he calls COMMONWEALTH. How will her family react when they see thinly disguised versions of themselves in a book?Later, Franny reflects on the role of Fate in their lives: if this hadn't happened, then that wouldn't have happened, and I would never have met him....and so on. She gives her mother a pass that irks me though: ""If her mother hadn't been so pretty none of it would have happened, but being pretty was nothing to blame her for."" But is it an excuse for having no moral character? And how about Bert with four kids and a wife he loved up until the moment he saw Beverly? Their reasons are never explored; this is after all, a story about the children's lives. I'd have to say this novel is an examination of the choices we make and the unintended ripple effect they have on others."

She is also so right about the paradox of parenting: we love our children, but being a parent is a very stressful experience.The best kind of books are the ones that make you reflect on your own life and help you relate better to the world. This was one of those books for me. This is also a book I would not have read had I not connected with so many people who enjoyed it on Goodreads."

90,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/676000-susan-meissner,Rating 5 out of 5,"I've been a fan of Ann Patchett since Bel Canto many years ago. She is a master artist of the written word and as clever and insightful as they come. So naturally I was a happy clam when I got my hands on her newest, Commonwealth.The story starts out at a christening party where two families are present. From that afternoon and across the next five decades, the individual lives in these two families will overlap. The pages quietly but evocatively explore the wonderful and wily way stories are shared between family members. The back cover says, and I love this, “Commonwealth is a meditation on inspiration, interpretation, and the ownership of stories. It is a brilliant and tender tale of the far-reaching ties of love and responsibility that bind us together.”I had the rare and amazing opportunity to hear Patchett speak about the writing of this book. She had my mom and me and the other 300 people in the venue in stitches and in tears as she cleverly spoke of the autobiographical quality of the story – it is crafted on her own family history. How like family life – to be laughing so hard your sides ache one moment and then huddled together in tears the next as you console each other over a shared loss.I am impressed any time a writer can take me on a story journey that is quietly impacting, sublimely demanding. I tend to write novels that have a more overt story arc, and usually about a protagonist who wants something and who faces a clear obstacle in her quest to have it. That's the story. Ann Patchett is able to write a tale that makes me primarily ponder the art of living, rather than the art of storytelling.I think what I found the most delicious was that every chapter read like a short story. Amazing, really, how Patchett was able to do that. The bigger story was always being told, but no chapter was wholly dependent on the one before it or the one after. That, to me, is flawless story-crafting and I now I am itching to try my hand at it. Some books I love because of their structure more than anything else. This is now one of them, along with The Art of Racing in the Rain, Life After Life, Life of Pi, All the Missing Girls, and The Good Girl.The oldest definition of “commonwealth” is “the general good.” We live our lives, short or long, woven into the fabric of a family, good or bad, and we quietly want this for our little tribe: a general good. Life is the pursuit of it.Highly recommended."
91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4853941-teresa,Rating 4 out of 5,"Parts of this book reminded me of Anne Tyler's writing. I mean this in the best possible way. Commonwealth is defined as a community, a group or unit in which there is a formation of people who all have a say and shared loyalty. This is a perfect summation for this story.I went to an author event with Ann Patchett last week. She spoke about her 4 year process in writing this novel. She told the audience that everyone in her family is divorced - parents, siblings, self, etc. She told us how she found out she had a step brother...that she was six years old and came home from school to find a young boy a little older than herself standing by the refrigerator. She told him, ""Get out of my house."" And, he replied the same way. No one had told her that her father's new spouse came with summer visitors that were children. They just showed up. In writing about divorced families, she was afraid that some of her family would find this to be autobiographical. When the manuscript was completed, she went to a copy center and sent everyone a copy of the book for their feedback. She said no one had any qualms about this novel being published and she loved her mother's comment the best. She said, "" None of it happened, but all of it is true."" After completing the book, I understand the mother's statement better. It definitely has a ring of truth to it. The dialog, incidents and interactions feel so real. At first I had a difficult time keeping family members straight; but, by the end of the book I was engaged with their stories and didn't have any trouble at all.While there are a few divorces in my family, it is rare. My parents just celebrated their 61st anniversary and my husband's parents had over 50 years together. But, you don't need to have experienced divorce or the blending of families to immerse yourself in this story. There is truly something universal about getting together with family as adults, discussing childhood memories and discovering that everyone has a unique or disparate view. ""Commonwealth"" has an overriding abiding love and forgiveness through it all. Moving, but not to the point of tears. Disturbing, and sometimes upsetting. Quiet, wonderfully composed vignettes of what it is like to grow up with one another, search for yourself as a young adult and reconnect later in life. "

Спустя год (и много плохих книжек) осталось другое послевкусие. “Бельканто” теперь грустный триллер, а “Предчувствие чуда” удивительная история про простых людей, а не турпоездочка в мясистые джунгли.⠀Отец четырех детей сбежал к матери двух дочерей, и каждое лето есть несколько дней, когда все эти шестеро совершенно разных подростков умудряются хоть как-то развлекаться и не разрушить нашу с вами реальность. Они ненавидят друг друга, но больше всего ненавидят своих родителей. И этот заряженный сюжетный пистолет обязательно выстрелит в отличие от того пистолета, что примотан банданой к ноге старшего ребенка.⠀Я не собирался читать “Свои-чужие”! Книжка про измену, после которой жизнь двух семей летит под откос? Нет, спасибо, читайте сами. Но что-то дернуло, звякнуло и вот я провел несколько удивительных дней и пятьдесят лет в компании четы Казинсов, где было место смеху, горю, вскрывшейся правде, стрекочущему и жужжащему лету и рождественскому снегопаду. Никаких заложников, джунглей и фокусников, только обычные люди, которые живут свои в целом обычные жизни и, скорее всего, ничего бы не захотели менять.⠀У Пэтчетт невероятный талант писать так, что даже после разгадывания интриги, тебе интересно узнать подробности про всех этих бесконечных детей, мачех и падчериц, что с ними было, что будет, чем сердце успокоится. И автор дает этой радости с горкой — она каждого сделала интересным. Эта любовь к персонажам просвечивается через страницы и греет душу читателю, который, возможно, боится, что идеальный покров плотного американского романа нарушит выскочивший откуда ни возьмись абьюз и прочие триггеры.

93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050107-jane,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book caught me by surprise.I’ve read some of Ann Patchett’s work but it’s been a long time since our last encounter; because I’ve liked what I’ve well enough to want to read more, but not quite well enough for months and years to slip by before a book landed that I thought I really must read.I expected it to be good, of course I did; but I didn’t expect it to have such depth and yet be so easy to read, and I didn’t expect it to preoccupy my thoughts during the days I spent travelling through its pages.Because this is a story of families, a story of lives lived, it would be very easy to say too much about people I met in this book who were so very real, and so I am going to spin my thoughts around the four paragraphs that I read before I started to read the book itself.
“One Sunday afternoon in Southern California, Bert Cousins shows up at Franny Keating’s christening party uninvited. Before evening falls, he has kissed Franny’s mother, Beverly—thus setting in motion the dissolution of their marriages and the joining of two families.""
This is the first chapter, and it is so accomplished. The story is simple, and it could be read quite simply and naturally, but it reveals much. Bert had a conversation at work with someone who thought that he had been invited, but he hadn’t, because he was a newcomer to the area and had barely met Fix Keating. He hadn’t intended to go, but spending Sundays at home with his pregnant wife and their three young children made him feel trapped; and so when he thought of the party he saw a chance of escape and seized it, plucking an unopened bottle of gin from his drinks cabinet as a rather unconventional christening gift as he went.Fix welcomed him and drew him into the throng. The bottle of gin was warmly received and it changed the tone of the party. Bert relaxed and his delight in the oranges that were being squeezed to mix with his gin – locals took orange trees for granted but they were still a novelty to him – drew him right into the company. It was quite natural for Fix to ask him to look out for his wife, for Bert to respond to Beverley’s beauty, for her to respond to that and accept a kiss ….The story lived and breathed, it felt to utterly real, and I could see so clearly what happened and why, and what the consequences might be.It could have been an exceptional short story, but it was just an introduction.
“Spanning five decades, Commonwealth explores how this chance encounter reverberates through the lives of the four parents and six children involved. Spending summers together in Virginia, the Keating and Cousins children forge a lasting bond that is based on a shared disillusionment with their parents and the strange and genuine affection that grows up between them.""
The chapters that followed moved between those four adults and six children. I was struck by how well the author delineated those characters, how well every one of those characters was drawn, how she allowed me to really know each one of them.It acknowledges how difficult it is to be a parent; and how parents can affect children before, ultimately, they have to take responsibility for their own lives. The story swung so naturally between different characters and different times. It was a masterful study of the consequences of divorce and remarriage on the two families is masterful; and I appreciated that it showed that so many things shape lives, that there is chance as well as consequence.I was struck by how well the characters and their relationships evolved, how the balance between the generations shifted, and that their were no heroes and villains; just complex, fallible human beings.
“When, in her twenties, Franny begins an affair with the legendary author Leon Posen and tells him about her family, the story of her siblings is no longer hers to control. Their childhood becomes the basis for his wildly successful book, ultimately forcing them to come to terms with their losses, their guilt, and the deeply loyal connection they feel for one another.""
There are many different moods, many different emotions in the chapters of this book. Because each character has a different position in their family and a different role in events; and so they react differently and make different choices in life. They come together though, to make a coherent whole.Nothing is quite as striking as the opening chapter, but I was particularly taken with the account of the meeting of Franny – who was wonderfully bookish – with the famous author; and its consequences, some predictable and some not.This passage captures their relationship perfectly:“Other than the difference in their ages, and the fact that he had an estranged wife, and had written a novel about her family which in its final form made her want to retch even though she had found it nothing less than thrilling when he was working on it, Franny and Leo were great.”The existence and the success of that novel brought another dimension to the story; the problems created by the fictionalised family history, the truths that it brings to light, and the differing reactions to having their story retold are fascinating.I was only sorry that I couldn't spend a little more time with some of them. The points in their lives that I was allowed to visit gave me a wonderful understanding, but there were life stories that were strands within this novel that could so easily of been centre-pieces.I'm thinking particularly of Albie, the child who would be born not long after Franny's christening party ....
“Told with equal measures of humour and heartbreak, Commonwealth is a meditation on inspiration, interpretation, and the ownership of stories. It is a brilliant and tender tale of the far-reaching ties of love and responsibility that bind us together.""
Yes it is.There were so many incidents and details that have stuck in my mind, and I almost feel that I should be talking them over with someone else who has meet the characters, or maybe even with the characters themselves.I can’t do that, and so I will simply say that this is a wonderfully engaging human story, and that it held me from the first page to the last."
94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843912-switterbug-betsey,Rating 5 out of 5,"Each novel written by Ann Patchett has a different setting with an original story and structure, so I always look forward to what she will write next. In her latest, COMMONWEALTH, which refers to the Commonwealth of Virginia, defining moments of family history took place there on a sprawling farm estate. It is a multigenerational story that spans over fifty years and decades of secrets, tragedies, and grief. Nevertheless, periods of contentment and moments of redemption also transpire. This year, I see a trend of novels about the province, extent, and gravity of family stories. From such diverse writers as Julian Barnes, Louise Erdrich, and Laura Lippman, among others, literature has shown us that the stories that we own tether us to those we shared them with, bind us to love and anchor us to loss, burden us with guilt or release us from blame. What price loyalty? And what penalty comes with shared history? The tragic story at the center of the narrative is unpacked gradually from the heavy baggage at hand, but the drama is told lightly, for the most part, with a dry and nimble wit that contrasts its weightiness. It begins in the past, in 1960s LA, where police detective Francis “Fix” Keating and his fetching wife, Beverly, are hosting a large and overflowing christening party for their youngest daughter, Franny. An unexpected and uninvited guest, attorney Albert Cousins, shows up to the party with gin and a grin. He has a pregnant wife and three children at home, but that doesn’t prevent him from meeting his future ex-wife, Beverly Keating. And so it goes, with Patchett portraying crucial but comic scenes at the party of covert kissing and tipsy ardor. And the Keatings and Cousins duly merge in a mixed batch--or, is that a mismatch? Consequently, the six combined children spend summers together in Virginia, and create a loyal bond with each other. The four parents take turns mismanaging their children. Proximity/absence is a poignant motif, with equal means to catastrophe. The failures of the parents are surely wrought on the children. Be we are still in the dark.In chapter two, baby Franny is middle-aged, and she is sitting with her elderly father while he undergoes chemotherapy. As they banter together, we are introduced to Patchett’s recurring theme of memories, and the problem with accuracy in recalling traumatic events. As Fix recalls the fateful shooting death of his police partner, he states that his memory was distorted by trauma, and he mixed up the face of the suspect soon after the event: “It was a quirk of the brain…But to this day I’ll tell you: I saw what I saw.” He concluded that, “Half the things in this life I wish I could remember and the other half I wish I could forget.”Family history is fleshed out incrementally and non-linearly, slowly building up suspense, or more like a sense of disquiet that we can’t yet grasp. Despite the tight bond between the children, their interpretations have fundamental flaws, and facts are ambiguous or murky, particularly about one life-altering event that changed everything. That is the mystery at the heart of the novel, which I don’t want to spoil by revealing. Suffice it to say that Patchett circles around the theme of stories with every generation. Although it is an ensemble cast. Franny emerges as a bit closer to the spotlight than the other children. Her love affair with a celebrated writer, Leo Posen, ups the ante. He puts Franny’s fugitive past into a permanent, unchangeable story. As we know from the cover blurb of COMMONWEALTH, her lover makes her family history his newest novel, and makes oral history into printed blockbuster. But how much is fact, and how much is fiction? What pieces might be missing, forgotten, misconstrued, even between the keepers of the story? But, regardless of the facts, this rubric is truer:“Everything that’s happened in our lives up until now, everything we’ve done, it had to happen exactly the way it did so that we could be together…”Don’t look for all the characters to be explicit, defined, or constant. I think that Patchett was telling us that we are as mutable and intangible as our memories, as porous and transformative as our stories. We are the collective custodians and interpreters, no less and no more."

The father (Bert Cousins) of one family with a lot of kids (Cal, Holly, Jeanette, Albie) divorces his wife (Teresa) and marries a woman (Beverly) who had 2 children (Franny, Caroline) by her first husband (Fix). Throw in Frannie’s lover (Leo Polen, a fiction writer) and there you have it. After Frannie tells Leo about her life and living with stepparents and parents and assorted half-brothers and half-sisters, he writes a book about them, and it becomes a bestseller (called Commonwealth). One of the children’s  death and I guess a cover-up is slowly told throughout the novel...it involved a gun, but I don’t think anyone was shot...Cal died of a bee sting...he wasn’t shot. But I did not fully get it I don’t think. It wasn’t a very intriguing or clever little story to embed within the novel if you ask me.  Actually, there were a lot more characters because the children grow up and take on lovers, husbands, and wives...and they all have names I have to assimilate into the story...aye-yi-yi. Some of the sentences were so contrived, I was saying to myself “This is Ann Patchett writing this sentence” ...I was not in the character or in the story line anymore. 🙁I remember when Ann Patchett was a newbie author.

She's the best storyteller and although this is a stylistic departure from her previous fiction she pulls it off flawlessly. This sprawling book follows the connections between two families over roughly sixty years. But it's ultimately about stories and how we tell them, share them and suppress them. It's incredibly powerful and moving while relishing in the quiet, the quotidien and the mundane. Her character development is glorious and the narrative drive of this book. It reminded me a little of Anne Tyler crossed with Alice Munro. Commonwealth is a wonderful read and a complete trimuph. The opening chapter will stay with me for life and rivals Ian McEwan's opening to Enduring Love. Ann Patchett you are EVERYTHING. "
99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes,Rating 4 out of 5,"'Commonwealth' is a good literary read. Thoughtful middle-class adults who still connect with their families would most enjoy this novel as I believe it is an honest historical appraisal of an ordinary middle-class American family. The plot follows the marital history and choices of several sets of middle-class parents in the 1960's, and how their choices shaped their children as they grew up. There are no extraordinary revelations, and the kids probably would have become the adults more or less they did become whatever these basically nice parents did, but very likely with a different set of guilts. I suspect things would not really have turned out much different, though some of the characters (and readers) might believe so. There are hints that birth order, personality, as well as the age of the kids when certain events occurred had a larger effect if the child was at the toddler stage, which is true to life. Ultimately, the book is both heartwarming and sad, as most realistic coming-of-age novels are, since in large families divorces and remarriages bring inevitably the deaths, illnesses and accidents which eventually come to all families. Many readers will recognize a character who resembles someone in their own real family, and perhaps in recognizing the real individual, will have a personal revelation in following the fictional character's travails, which of course, is the value of reading a book like this. However, for me, the book was a little bland and without strength. Ordinary middle-class life is not without drama, especially to the affected family members, but to me, it is clear major events in an ordinary middle-class American family do not much change the outcome of lives the way truly devastating events do. I am sure that does not feel like a true statement to some people with ordinary families, though. Sorry. My bad.This is a meaningful and insightful read, as well as a good description of an ordinary American middle-class family (plus funny revelations about some literary and publishing habitués). For me, the novel led me to a conclusion that no matter how terrible family things seem at the time for ordinary families, events tend to smooth out if people try to understand a relative's honest mistakes and forgive each other. Shit happens, and most of it turns out to be less important in the long-run for ordinary middle-class folks, although it may shape in a mild way the direction a life forms. I don't think forgetting and burying stuff is a good thing, which I think Patchett also believes. Self-discoveries are rewarding. (However, I personally think middle-class angst is a tad dull of a read, although obviously I am envious of the safety nets I picked up on in reading about an ordinary American middle-class family lifestyle.)Professional newspaper book reviewers mention they believe 'Commonwealth' is autobiographical to some degree, as many plot details of the story are the same as the author Ann Patchett's life. However, she has added in those fictional touches and changes writers must have to make an enjoyable fictional story. She has also included humorous twists and plot architecture development which lift the novel into the territory of literary and universal truths."

Jos knygos turi tokią savotišką savybę būti tarytum atsitraukusios nuo savo pačių veikėjų, lyg veiksmą, išgyvenimus, jausmus ir virsmus skaitytojas stebėtų per plėvelę, lyg ir jautru viskas, bet kartu ir taip tolima, kad nesergi už juos, neskauda tarytum, kažkokia klinikiška literatūra. Ir perskaičiusi jau trečią jos knygą suprantu, kad tas toks su distancija, truputį „pretentious“, biškį snobiškas rašymo stilius yra neatsitiktinis ir man jis labai patinka! (žinau, kad kai kuriuos kaip tik žudo.)Knyga apie dvi šeimas, kurios atsitiktinai susiduria vakarėlyje Kalifornijoje, kai kas kai ką įsimyli, kažkas kažką palieka, šeimos persipina ir iš to vieno saulėto, karšto, apelsinais kvepiančio baliaus išsirutulioja visas gyvenimas, o po to ir mirtis. Patchett mėgsta nesismulkinti ir aprėpti kelis dešimtmečius. Ji ima tam tikrą įvykį kaip kažkokios fundamentalios traumos/posūkio tašką ir po to konstruoja, kaip tai galėtų pakeisti VISĄ VISŲ to įvykio dalyvių gyvenimą (lygiai tas pats jos kitoje knygoje „Dutch house“ – vėlgi su šeimos iširimo pasekmėm).+ Fainas jau minėtas rašymo stilius, graži kalba, kartu ir paprasta, kaip į nieką nepretenduojančio psichologinio romano, o kartu ir vienu laipteliu aukščiau, kad klausant reikia truputį įsitempti. + Daug veikėjų ir visi nei geri, nei blogi, jų gyvenimai raizgosi tarpusavy ir tik pabaigoj supranti, kad aaaa, čia gi tas dėl to buvo. Man patinka, kad šokinėja tiek chronologiškai, tiek fokuso plotmėj, t.y. atskirus epizodus regi skirtingi veikėjai, ir visai nereikia – kaip popsas mėgsta – pavadinti skyriaus veikėjo vardu.- Vietomis nuobodu, kai kalba apie nieką. Kai kurios kalbos taip niekur ir nenuvedė. - Pusę knygos neskyriau, kurie vaikai priklauso kuriems tėvams ir patėviams ir pamotėms, visi kartu ir skirtingai sukurpti, bet vis tiek ir vienodi, jauti, kad jie visi yra tik pati Patchett. Atrodo, kad visus savo veikėjus ji kuria pagal kažkokį vieną šabloną (ar tik čia ne pagal jos pačios vaikystę ši knygą? Gal tikrai smarkiai prakošusi pro save).- Ši knyga, lyginant su kitom dviem mano skaitytom, pasirodė mažiausiai išrutuliota, gal net per trumpa? Šį kartą būtų norėjęsi ne tiek plačiai, o giliau apie gedulą, netektį ir cope-inimą. (bet gal jau prisiskaičiau per daug Tartt „Little friend“ ir noriu kad viskas būtų apie gedulą...) All in all – gera."

COMMONWEALTH starts out slowly as family and friends gather at the house of Beverly and Fix Keating to celebrate the christening of their second daughter, Franny. Among the guests is Bert Cousins, who vaguely knows Fix through work and is mainly looking for an excuse to get away from his wife and children.A kiss between Bert and Beverly leads to the dissolution of two marriages and upheaval in the lives of six children. But kids are resilient and soon the Cousins/Keating offspring have formed alliances that linger into adulthood. A misstep by the adult Franny who lazily confides in her lover, a renowned author, ends up putting family secrets into the public eye.Patchett is a sneaky trickster. Just as the reader is convinced they are embarking on another Divorced Family Saga, there's a subtle change. Out comes the deepening of personalities and the layering of one character's story over another. Later each child is revisited as an adult and often these new lives surprise us. Ditto for the four parents especially Teresa Cousins, Bert's first wife, who makes a particularly poignant reappearance in the next-to-last chapter. By the time the book ended I was begging it not to. My hope was to linger with all of the characters, even the ones shuffling towards the graveyard. Hats off to Ann Patchett. Once again she illustrates why she is the queen of sharp, thoughtful fiction. 4.5 stars. Highly recommended especially for readers who enjoyed TEN THOUSAND SAINTS by Eleanor Henderson; CARRY THE ONE by Carol Anshaw; and AMONG OTHER THINGS, I'VE GIVEN UP SMOKING by Aoibheann Sweeney. There's bound to be comparisons to this year's other ""sibling book,"" THE NEST by Cynthia D'Aprix Sweeney, as well. "

The plot follows two families, connected by a chance encounter at a christening, which changes the direction of their lives. The narrative focuses on the blended family members, and how their relationships change over time. This book is mostly character-driven, though there is a slim plot that involves the death of one sibling and publication of the family’s secrets. It is slow in developing and shifts forward and backward in time, gradually providing a more complete picture for the reader. I enjoy Ann Patchett’s writing, and Commonwealth adheres to the high quality writing I have come to expect. This one was not my favorite, but I liked it. I can also recommend: State of Wonder, Bel Canto, and The Dutch House.3.5"

Bert e Teresa são um casal com quatro filhos; Fix e Beverly são um casal com dois filhos. Bert e Beverly divorciam-se, casam um com o outro e passam a ter seis filhos. Que são crianças traquinas, depois adolescentes rebeldes mas, no fim, adultos extraordinários. O romance inicia-se na festa de baptizado da bebé Franny, uma das seis crianças, e termina quando ela tem mais de cinquenta anos. Com recurso a avanços e recuos no tempo, são-nos narrados vários momentos da vida destas famílias; as diabruras das crianças; as suas paixões, casamentos, descendências e separações; os estudos e carreiras profissionais; a velhice e doença dos pais; e muito mais. Provavelmente, nunca teria lido este livro se não andasse sempre no Goodreads e não visse as 5* da Sandra (que mais tarde mo recomendou). Obrigada Sandra. Obrigada, também, a todos os membros desta Comunidade de quem ""copio"" excelentes leituras, as quais me têm proporcionado felizes e enriquecedores momentos de vida."
104,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,I really love Ann Patchett's work and I thought her last book State of Wonder was really fantastic with images still remaining with me today. However I think this book is much less successful and tries to do too much. Covering five generations across two families I kept losing track of who was who until quite late in the book. It weaves its way through time and flashbacks often within the same paragraph so I felt quite lost at times. But Patchett's writing is always good and this is told with a good modicum of humour too that saves it from being tiresome.
105,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2600090-kathryn,Rating 4 out of 5,This was so different than her last book which I loved. This was very good all about the dynamics in a family and all it's parts. There were secrets and a mystery or two that aren't really mysteries just different ways to interpret what happened. A great read.
106,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32300055-sarah-at-sarah-s-bookshelves,Rating 5 out of 5,"Commonwealth is a simply and perfectly told story of a cobbled together family…and is one of my favorite books of 2016 so far! Every member of the blended Keating/Cousins family behaves dreadfully, but I was somewhat sympathetic towards all of them. The four Cousins children and two Keating girls are impressively creative in their antics, but I rooted for them because their parents are so completely uninterested in and overwhelmed by them. And, it wasn’t their fault that their parents selfishly created this impossible situation. But, I also sympathized with the parents because their children’s united hatred of them resulted in an incredible amount of tormenting.""The Cousins children and the Keating children smiled up with beatific forgiveness. They had done everything they had ever wanted to do, they had had the most wonderful day, and no one even knew they were gone.""There is nothing grand about this story, no bells and whistles in the plot or the writing. But Ann Patchett can really tell a story…one that is beautiful and satisfying and reflects the mess of real life without resorting to tricks. She releases information about her characters in drips and drabs (similar to Did You Ever Have A Family) and describes scenes of mundane life that perfectly illustrate her characters:""When their father took the girls to the alley behind the grocery store at six o’clock in the morning with their racquets and fresh cans of tennis balls, Caroline would have as many as twenty-seven consecutive hits without missing. Thwack, thwack, thwack, into the blank wall that was the back of the A&P, her long arms intuitively graceful in their swing. Franny’s personal best was three consecutive hits, and that had only happened once. But the real difference between Caroline and Franny was that Caroline cared. She cared about the law and tennis and her grades in classes she didn’t even like. She cared what their father said about their mother, what he said about everything. Franny just wanted to go back to the car and read Agatha Christie.""Commonwealth is a book that I enjoyed every minute of reading. I couldn’t wait for my next opportunity to read and I didn’t want it to end.Visit my blog, www.sarahsbookshelves.com, for more reviews."

That said, I have trouble with her. I can't put my finger on why, I just can never get into the flow of the story. In the case of Commonwealth, and the opening of the baby christening....I was hooked, and thought, ""Hallelujah"" I had found my Patchett book.  Then, (wah, wah) it kind of went downhill for me. There were some peaks, but the effort to get to the top of the hill was hard. The back and forth between timelines was a bit bothersome to me, sometimes it works but in this one it did not. I felt the story did not connect from character to character and from past to present. It felt disjointed and I caught myself losing interest and rushing through the story. The story itself was a wonderful premise, especially as I love unconventional and dysfunctional families....and this cast of characters was all that! I loved the band of misfit children and how they functioned as a unit, however, I was a bit betrayed that they grew up. The adult characters, they were wonderfully written but they were just sad. Will I try another Patchett....probably, as I would like to discover the magic so many others do. Will I rush to do so, maybe not."

Prior to me re-reading the book, I recall reading the opening pages of the book when I first decided to give it a chance. However, I did not think it was fair to rate a novel by rushing through it, so I made a mental note to give it a second chance. Unfortunately, this book second attempt was worse, I questioned why I even decided to give it another shot. The writing style was mundane, it highly influenced my rating of this book The characters were slightly developed, but the story was inconsistent. Some pages were so basic and trite,thus I had no reason to continue to torture myself.Do I regret that I re-read it? Not really. I like to give books a chance to see if it has a chance to impress me but I do regret me not trusting my instincts about first impressions. Initially I did not like the writing style, but the reader in me wanted to at least attempt it again.Oh well, two stars for the effort but I doubt I will be reading more novels by Patchett."
109,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4428094-fictionophile,Rating 4 out of 5,"I own three of Ann Patchett’s books, including the award winning “Bel Canto“. However, with review commitments, I didn’t get to them. Now I know I’ve got some excellent reading in store.“Commonwealth” was unexpected. Its myriad characters put me off at first. There were so many that I couldn’t seem to keep them straight. Then, there were the extreme jumps in time period, sometimes as much as fifty years… After I got my head around accepting the challenge, I just decided to roll with it and see where it led. What a good decision!Our memories are a collection of disjointed scenes, colored by our emotions at the time. Like our memories, “Commonwealth“, is a treasure trove of vivid scenes sewn together to make a cohesive whole. And what scenes! There was one I will always remember.It was of six young children, negligently unsupervised, who are left to their own devices for seven hours in a strange motel. They decide to seek out a nearby lake and set off with several cans of Coke, several chocolate bars, a full bottle of gin, and… a gun!Then there was one of a young woman taking (very expensive) lobsters that someone had purchased for a meal, and snipping their bands, released them back into the ocean.And the one where Franny meets Leon while working behind the bar. She takes her heels off because her feet are hurting…The one where Albie, the smallest boy, is drugged with Benadryl by the other children so that he won’t have to accompany them on their adventures. They leave him sleeping in a pile of dirty laundry.And one scene, particularly poignant, where an older man was taken to the beach in his wheelchair…Scenes which, while separately seem disjointed – join to form a portrait of a blended family.It all began at a christening party. When an uninvited guest, (a married father of four) felt attracted to the baby’s young and beautiful mother of two. Their lives moved on to break apart two marriages and the lives of their six children. Strangely, the children held no animosity toward one another, they kept that solely for their parents.“Commonwealth” may refer to the Commonwealth of Virginia, where one of the sets of parents lived. Or, it could refer to the ‘common wealth’ of the blended family. Children who seemed much richer when together. The story is set in two states: California and Virginia. The two children from California spent their summers with the four children from Virginia.A traumatic event happens to the family one summer which forever colors their psyche and the family’s collective memory. Years later, when this event is related to a novelist by one of the grown up children, their story, once deeply personal, is made into a novel (also called “Commonwealth”) which exposes their story to the world.“How difficult it would be to map out all the ways the future would unravel without the moorings of the past”.There are so many interesting characters in “Commonwealth” that it is hard to say that one is the ‘protagonist’. Though… if I had to chose one, it would be Franny. She is the baby who was being celebrated at the christening party at the beginning. She is a reader, and introspective. It is she who falls in love with a much older author and shares her family’s story with him. It is she that brings this story to a close.This is a story of love in its myriad forms. Of siblings who come to cherish one another. It is also a story of fate, loss, disappointments, mistakes, betrayal, and regret. “Commonwealth” is a novel that is, above all else, real and it eloquently depicts the quiet drama that is everyday life.Now I know why Ann Patchett has garnered a reputation for quality literary fiction."
110,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge,Rating 4 out of 5,"Digital audiobook narrated by Hope DavisTwo families – the Cousins and the Keatings – are intertwined after a chance encounter at the christening party for Franny Keating. The couples divorce, and intermarry. The novel follows the four parents and six children over five decades. The children form a bond over their shared summers in Virginia. But in her twenties, Franny meets a famous author and begins an affair with him. He uses the stories she tells of her siblings and their childhood as the basis for his best-selling novel. With all their secrets in plain view, the siblings have to come to terms with their family dynamic. As children, the six kids are frequently left to their own devices, the adults in their lives too busy with their own drama to focus on the children. And what could possibly happen? How the adult siblings each interpret and remember what has happened, and how they manage the burden of guilt or shame is the main focus of the novel. Everyone self-medicates with alcohol – gin and orange juice being a particular favorite, a “cure” passed down from parents to their adult children. If I’ve made this sound bleak, well, it isn’t. As in real life, there are scenes that are humorous to balance those that are distressing. Patchett really shines when exploring human relationships. She slowly reveals secrets, desires, hopes, and fears until the reader feels she truly knows these people. Little by little events are revealed, and characters are fully realized. Like her other works, this would be a great choice for a book club discussion!Hope Davis does a fine job narrating the audiobook. She has great pacing and really brought the novel to life for me."

A family saga that spans five decades, a couple of affairs, and a book within a book that brings the whole house of cards down, this is the kind of read that makes you realize Patchett is to writing what Meryl Streep is to acting. #therealdeal #definitelynotoverrated Now comes the part where I admit this is my first read of hers!

All I want to do is gush but I will try to say something intelligent.The story opens at a christening party. It is a family of Catholic cops and the Deputy DA shows up uninvited for reasons that are not clear to anyone. By the end of that first chapter you don't quite know what you have just read about but you do know it was unsettling and fun at the same time.That is how it goes for pretty much the whole novel except quite a bit of sadness gets added to the mix.Two divorces, six siblings and half-siblings shuffled back and forth between two sets of parents, unreliable adults, kids left to their own devices. It is tragic, sometimes humorous, and you cannot look away.Never for one minute do you doubt that this is Ann Patchett. She has performed this trick for novel after novel. Not sentimentality, not sensationalism, and just a bit off from what we like to think about humanity and family and relationships and love.She has a unique proprietary recipe for writing novels. Even as she exposes us for the moral weaklings that we are, she still gives us hope and reasons to believe that love is the answer. "

In this interesting novel we meet two families who eventually intertwine, a bevy of kids, six to be told, and a mountain of problems. The kids, the product of the two marriages that have failed are through circumstances beyond their control forced to become a family. Their various dysfunctions become the gist of the novel as they all learn to cope in various and sundry ways what life has given them The erstwhile parents having left their first marriages, Beverly with two children and Bert (who incidentally is their neighbor) with his four. Eventually Beverly and Bert divorce their respective spouses and marry one another. The parents themselves are no strangers to ""issues"" and perhaps the word narcissist can be applied to the both of them. The six combined kids are pretty much left to their own devices with their other parents seeming to take a backseat to their upbringing. Their trials and tribulations are well documented and how it all works out in the end is really what makes this book quite endearing. Sometimes, no matter what life shells out, people do survive. "

However, my enthusiasm waned a bit through the events of this family and in the end, I just finished it because I was 3/4 of the way through.Maybe I'm too old. I remember family sagas of old, where characters were developed, the imagery detailed and books took their time to lay out the plot. There were too many bits, too many characters, especially all the parents, that I didn't get. I've read 90 page novellas with exquisite characterization and 1000 page novels that kept my interest.

As the feeling of nostalgia threatened to overwhelm me, the book seemed like the perfect fit for the situation.This book is about what home means. Beyond its tangible/physical meaning, what is home intangibly? It can be a person, a memory, a feeling, even the past, so much so that the present doesn't feel like home. It asks the question - where do you feel you belong? And when is the last time you felt with absolute certainty that you WERE home?It's about families. Dysfunctional families to whom I am SLIGHTLY addicted to in literature. Families who are strongly bound and also families whose bonds are so superficial that they don't take anything to rupture. Also, families that last even after the rupture. It's the story of relationships - between parents, siblings, spouses. Irresponsible parents and their responsible children. Ultimately, love, hope and a shared past being the only things that can make a family last.What else? It's about human beings. About bad decisions, weaknesses, selfishness, dreams lost and found, insecurities and inability to live up to others' aspirations. There are no big issues that the book talks about. It's about one experiences everyday, what one sees everyday. Yet, somehow this book about 'everyday' has lingered in my mind ever since. Visit my Bookstagram for more book reviews:  Literarianism "

I can't believe I've been on the library waiting list since last summer. There are a lot of people who want to read this and I wonder if they will be disappointed as I am. I hope not. I hope everyone who reads it just loves it but not me. I found it to be so depressing. There were these careless adults who could barely look up from their own lives to see what was happening to their children. There were two couples and they split up and one mother married the other dad so these kid's lives were intertwined forever. One mother thought nothing of leaving 6 kids alone while she went to the movies to get out of the heat. Her new husband lived at work so he didn't have to be with the kids. One mother was simply overwhelmed. Fix, the cop, and, to me the only likable character, tries his best but what he thinks is appropriate to teach kids is questionable. One of their children gives their life story to a noted novelist. It's so sad how casually she gives it away and how it comes back to haunt them all in different ways. It's really sad how they all kind of bumble through life but considering their lack of parenting, not surprising. I just found it sad and depressing and far from a favorite of mine."

Commonwealth was a bone-deep exploration of the lives of the Cousins and Keating families when the Dad and Mom, respectively, of each family decide to leave their spouses and marry each other. What follows is the journey of each individual as they navigate this particular commonwealth created out of both love and selfishness. I went through a series of emotions while reading this - anger, despair, hope, disappointment, eventually reaching a point of antipathy just as the turning point in the story occurs. What happened next was Patchett reeling me back in and punishing me for ever doubting her (in a good way).The book really hinges on one of the daughter's becoming involved with a famous author, whose recent bestseller is based on stories of her family. The result is explosive as estranged members of the family find out and secrets and truths kept hidden finally come to light. I thought Patchett did an admirable job of balancing out the relationships. It wasn't treacly or manipulative, dire or maudlin. The characters and situations felt true and I came to care about them.

This character-driven domestic drama swept me up into the lives of the Cousins and Keating families as Patchett deftly revealed secrets and tragedies over the span of five decades. Be assured that “Commonwealth” is not without Patchett’s wry humor, after all, it IS about family.""Commonwealth"" is a novel about two families whose fates are set into motion one LA afternoon in the 1960s at a Christening party to which a large bottle of gin is brought, and ripe oranges happen to be plentiful on the neighborhood trees. If any one detail of that day had been different, so would be the lives of the two families that were set into motion like a cascade of falling dominoes. ""Commonwealth"" is immediately engrossing; I can't imagine reading the first chapter and not being compelled to read on. The novel floats back and forth in time and among the members of the Cousins and Keating families, specifically the six children united by their hatred of their parents. Don't let the term ""domestic drama"" fool you into thinking this is light fare; Patchett can do in 300 pages what Franzen does in 600 - paint a fully realized picture of family life with all its many facets: humor, despair, evil thoughts, sibling rivalry, fraught relationships, tragedies, revenge and betrayal. Speaking of betrayal, Patchett employs a neat little conceit by having one of the characters reveal family secrets to a famous author who uses these as the basis of a prize-winning bestseller called, ""Commonwealth"". Several sections of the novel deal with how particular family members react to their lives being re-told and re-shaped for mass consumption. As an avid reader of family-centric novels, I wondered how often this scenario plays out in reality; I’m guessing it is often.I've read Patchett's entire oeuvre, and no two novels are alike, yet Patchett writes convincingly in each; we don't feel she's merely researched her topics well, we feel she's LIVED them. Has she: lived in a home for unwed mothers? Been a magician's assistant, or an opera singer held captive? Has she been to the Amazon? Is she a child of divorce? Unlikely all are true, but one would be forgiven for wondering.""Commonwealth"", is one of those novels that you race to finish because you want to know what happens to characters you’ve come to care about, while at the same time you want to slow down to make it last."
135,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16912659-dorie---cats-books,Rating 4 out of 5,"Like Bel Canto before it, Commonwealth is about people, how different we all are and yet how much the same. How we react to different things that happen to us in life. How, like a pebble tossed in a pond sends ripples outward, growing ever larger, more and more of those we love are affected by our actions.As you all know from the blurb for this book, it all starts with a christening party for one year old Franny and an uninvited guest. I didn’t immediately love this book. The cast of characters was very large and it swung back and forth in time often without warning. I’m used to juggling lots of characters but this was a bit different because the characters weren’t very developed before we find them in the present, then back in the past, back to present. It wasn’t until half way through the book that I was comfortable enough with them all that I really started to enjoy the book.Ms. Patchett writes beautifully and her prose flows consistently, sometimes soft as a little boy in a Benadryl induced sleep, other times as loud as “the guests in the other room, the hilarity in their voices raised by the eggnog and champagne. The piano player playing something faster now, maybe a jazzed-up version of “The Twelve Days of Christmas”. So much happens to these two families and their six children that it was quite unbelievable in parts, particularly when “Commonwealth” was published and the grown children realized that it was a story of their lives. This is, however, fiction and so we have the freedom to create stories that are interesting to the reader. As a mother and grandmother I know how we always try to protect those that we love from emotional and physical trauma. As our character Fix said “There’s no protecting anyone . . . . keeping people safe is a story we tell ourselves” and this is certainly true of our adult children.This is a book that I think most people would enjoy and would be a great book club read. I received an ARC of this book from the publisher."
136,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57406996-janeyre9,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was my first book by Ann Patchett and I did not know what I was in for. I recently read The Nest and was prepared for a disfunctional family drama along those lines. Commonwealth blew my expectations away. I love literature involving families, I love jumps in time, I love endings that don't fix every single issue and leave some room to wonder, and I love imperfect characters. This had all of that in spades. The dynamics between the Keatings and Cousins families were lovely to read, even when they were ugly and sad but particularly when they were loving and forgiving. When siblings and stepsiblings came together, when Fix and Teresa share moments of bonding, when parents are forgiven or at least given some leeway, that's when the true magic happened in Commonwealth. I did want to know a bit more about each character, especially Albie and Jeanette, but I appreciated that that author tried to give us insight into everyone and some idea of who they become and how they got there. I can't quite explain what I loved about this book so much, it isn't particularly thrilling, but that might be the allure. It feels real, it feel likes family, and while sometimes that drives you crazy it's often where we can be the most comfortable."
137,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8887111-denise,Rating 3 out of 5,Commonwealth by Ann Patchette began with an intriguing but long drawn out christening. The plot just rambled along with a few peeks of interest. This novel was beautifully written but I never was connected to any character or cared about them. This dysfunctional family seemed to just drift along without purpose. The audio version of this book was the only reason I finished it! Giving this book 3 generous stars ( KUYH October buddy read)

I felt like I was a part of these two flawed families whose lives we learn are so interconnected over decades. She created real lives so well and left you loving some of them while hating others and feeling sorry for some as well. This is my third Patchett book and I will definitely go back for more.

140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83419690,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett writes about the possibility of happiness, there and then - where and when you can not think. Well, not that straight happiness, sparkling waterfalls. Rather, kindness, participation, respect, friendship, attention and understanding, care, tenderness, affection - those modest components that make life a little more comfortable.A family lives: he, she, children, and then she (he) meets another (another), and everything goes to hell. The ordinariness of divorce has muffled in us, today, the understanding of it as a universal tragedy. Even the injured party is comforted more easily, and the children's psyche is completely flexible, ""we say to ourselves,"" And the main thing is that seeing their parents unhappy in marriage day after day, they themselves will not learn to be happy."" As if assuming that the sight of adults preoccupied with building two new nests on the ruins of one old one - he will learn happiness.Reality lurches and collapses, half of the world is cut off, and the second, on which survival now depends, manipulates you, inspires hatred for the separated one. And then each of them is busy building a new relationship, and there is no place for you again. After that, everything will somehow get better, but you are already a little animal in this new world, who knows what it is to survive. It happens not in the most socially approved ways.Свои люди, сочтемсяКнига была про невыносимое бремя жизни: работа, дом, дружба, брак, дети - словно все, чего эти люди хотели и над чем трудились, укрепляло, как цементом, их невозможность стать счастливыми.На самом деле все с точностью до наоборот, Энн Пэтчетт пишет о возможности счастья, там и тогда - где и когда помыслить не можешь. Ну, не то, чтобы прям счастья, сверкающими водопадами. Скорее доброты, участия, уважения, дружбы, внимания и понимания, заботы, нежности, привязанности - тех его скромных составляющих, что делают жизнь чуточку уютнее. Живет семья: он, она, дети, а потом она (он) встречает другого (другую), и все летит в тартарары. Обыденность развода приглушила в нас, сегодняшних, понимание его как вселенской трагедии. Уже и пострадавшая сторона утешается легче, а у детей психика вовсе гибкая, - говорим мы себе, - ""И главное, что видя день за днем несчастливых в браке родителей, они сами не научатся быть счастливыми"". Словно предполагая, что вид взрослых, озабоченных свиванием двух новых гнезд на руинах одного старого - уж он-то выучит счастью.Реальность кренится и рушится, половина мира оказывается отсечена, а вторая, от которой теперь зависит выживание, манипулирует тобой, внушает ненависть к отделившейся. А потом каждый из них оказывается занят построением новых отношений, и для тебя снова не находится места. После все как-то наладится, но ты в этом новом мире уже немного зверек, знающий что такое выживать. Случается не самыми социально-одобренными способами.""Свои-Чужие"" об этом и еще о многом. Например? О том, какие разные дети рождаются в одной семье. Гены одни и те же, воспитание и возможности получают примерно одинаковые, но эти при этом миленькие, покладистые и смышленые, а тем хоть говори, хоть кол на голове теши. Один как кошка, своим присутствием создает уют, а другой в комнату входит - и как железом по стеклу. О том, что когда детей в семье много, углядеть за всеми (одновременно накормив, обстирав, поддерживая порядок в доме и зарабатывая на необходимое) физически невозможно. О том, что предоставленные самим себе, дети скорее всего сдружатся, но компания окажется не по типу ""Тимура и его команды"" а в духе банды Квакина. О том, что у пьяных и детей должны быть очень сильные ангелы-хранители, но даже и они иногда не справляются.Как хочется рассказать о том, что болезненно саднит с детства, чем не с кем было поделиться - и быть услышанной-понятой тем, кого ценишь и уважаешь. Какое счастье встретить его, умного, сильного, успешного, который увидит в тебе свою Музу. Как он сделает из твоей истории книгу, станет еще более знаменит, но ты так и останешься официанткой из гостиничного комплекса, которую его друзья воспринимают годной на то, чтобы готовить для них и убирать за ними, когда удостаивают визитом (часто). А еще потом, с ужасом осознаешь, что поделилась историей, которая не тебе одной принадлежала, и заплатишь утратой самых значимых для тебя отношений.О том, как в тебе с детства было что-то такое. что заставляло других людей кривиться недовольно, и в компании ты всегда ощущал себя лишним, и приучился игнорировать чужую неприязнь по принципу ""не больно-то нужно"", но жизнь твоя вся как-то наперекосяк, общаешься с отребьем, творишь гадости, не умеешь ничего добиться. А потом в случайно попавшеся книге (""в прошлом году шуму наделала""), узнаешь себя, противного мальчишку, которого старшие братья-сестры опаивали барбитуратами, чтобы не мешался под ногами.О том, как отправляешь скоту-муженьку с его новой ваших четверых детей на все лето без единого чемодана (""папа вам купит все новое""), зная, что зарплата помощника прокурора не то, чтобы высокая, а на нем семья из четырех человек - у нынешней две дочери. А пусть-ка покрутятся.О том, как мечешься всю жизнь крыской в лабиринте, и успехи не радуют, а другие удачливей тебя, и жрешь себя без конца. Пока в один день не понимаешь вдруг, что тебе нужны лишь пок��й и медитация. В общем:- Вы продаете идеальных отношениев?- Нет, только показываем.- Красивое"

And it took few pages to get used to her style, which is a bit modern. Because of the title ""Commonwealth"" I had pushed down and down in my tbr list, fearing a political topic in it. But when it came up as a group read in one of my groups, I was happy to take it up.""Commonwealth"" is NOT about politics/ independent states in USA or such stuff.( But it has Virginia in it though)I think it's about the 6 children who were like these independent states, an independent entity in the story, so away from their parents or connected in their own individual way.There are 2 families, Cousins and Keatings.Bert and Teresa Cousins have 4 children- Cal, Holly, Jeanette and Albie.Fix and Beverly Keatings have 2 children - Caroline and Franny.Story starts in 1960's when Bert comes uninvited to Keatings's house for the christening party of Franny and ends up kissing Beverly Keatings. Thus ending both the marriages and starting a new bond between the 6 children. Every summer after 2 divorces and a marriage, kids meet up for summer and start a new relationship. UNTIL a tragedy strikes!Then when Franny gets involved with a long forgotten writer Leon Posen, he gets an inspiration for his new novel ""Commonwealth"" from Franny's childhood story. This novel impacts everyone in the two families, but all are too old or have moved on that the results of impacts is mild but important. Then again. story moves ahead to when they are in their 40's and shows what had really happened! Story unravels slowly, nothing too dramatic, just as in our life, everyone moves on. Patchett's style is new for me and I liked it. Too blunt but aren't we all blunt in our heads! Blunt thoughts of normal people struggling to go on through their day is what i thought at the end. It's about family, even though everyone dislikes almost everyone in this book, everyone cares about everybody in it. (see, just like us! well , I do).One thing which I wonder is How beautifully Patchett has managed to put irresponsible parents, wild running kids and a rage/anger that is shown so naked among only family. It's amazing!"
142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3106785-beth-bonini,Rating 4 out of 5,"In an essay titled ""The Getaway Car"" (from This is the Story of a Happy Marriage), Patchett states that she has, in reality, only one story to tell: ""a group of strangers are thrown together . . ."". As I was reading this novel, I couldn't help but notice how many autobiographical details had been used (her parents' divorce; her biological father's profession; her own stint as a waitress), but the really key thing about the story is that ""a group of strangers are thrown together"" - in this case, as step-siblings. Too much gin and orange juice at baby Franny's Christening, coupled with her mother's striking beauty in a yellow dress, leads to the breakdown of two marriages - and the uneasy union of six children during hot, troubled summers in the ""commonwealth"" of Virginia. (The title, Commonwealth, has several rather clever meanings within the book.)Patchett doesn't tell the story in chronological order; does anyone, these days? Instead, she moves (more or less smoothly) back and forth in time, presenting key episodes in a middle-aged life. At very nearly the end of the novel, Franny muses on how all of the events of the past, both good and bad, were all necessary to lead her to the present: ""Franny, half asleep on top of the bedspread beside her husband, was unable to map out all the ways the future would unravel without the moorings of the past."" All of the tragedies, both small and large, were necessary - or at least ineradicable.For me, Patchett excels as a writer of essays. Her language and her structure are just so impeccable. There are some well-constructed moments in this novel, too, but it doesn't hold together as well. I did find it both entertaining and compelling, but I also felt it could be tightened up and refined. I think that most anyone who enjoys contemporary family drama will be entertained, but I don't think it is the best example of Patchett's writing."
143,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/301501-erin,Rating 4 out of 5,"Review originally published in the Charleston Gazette Mail, February 4, 2017. Ann Patchett. I love Ann Patchett. I adore her. Members of my book club and I made a pilgrimage to Parnassus Books in Nashville to meet her last winter and we were so excited to hear about COMMONWEALTH - we read everything she writes. This is not my favorite of her books. Don't get me wrong, it's a lovely, multi-layered story that begins with a drunken kiss and ends over fifty years later, but I guess I kept waiting for more to happen. Albert Cousins arrives, uninvited to a christening party for Fix Keating's daughter Franny. Why does this assistant DA want to come to a cop party? Because he likes to be anywhere that isn't at home with his wife Teresa and their four children. That night Bert kisses Fix's beautiful wife Beverly and the die is cast.....what we see next is that Bert and Beverly have married and moved to Virginia where they have six children, either full or part-time. We then follow the family, or parts of the family, over the next years - what becomes of them all? How does a childhood tragedy change them (if it does)? Do they become what we expect of them or not? It's fertile ground for a book, but there was a fundamental problem for me - too many indistinguishable characters. Sometimes I wasn't sure which sister was which or who belonged to whom or who had what relationship with another character. And perhaps the book wouldn't have had the same resonance with fewer children, but perhaps it was a matter of their personalities not being strong enough to be clear, especially during the period they were younger. However, this being Patchett the book is lovely and well-written....but, it being Patchett I wanted to love and adore it unconditionally, and I didn't. But still her, though. Always her."
144,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2994598-blaine-desantis,Rating 5 out of 5,"What a fine book! I have not read any of Ann Patchett's work previously - seems like a theme for me with so many authors here in 2016 - but this was certainly a very worthwhile effort and story. It is a book that leaves me thinking about families, both functional and dysfunctional, and how they get along through life.Here we have a story of 6 children in two families and eventually the mother of one family marries the father of the other family. Not a lot of time or effort is spent on the ""adults"" but rather this is a book about the kids and how they adapt (or fail to adapt), and what goes on in their lives. The book takes us through the joint family scenario, with the real story being that the six kids like each other and are united in their dislike of the parents and the situation in which they are placed. The story covers over 50 years and each chapter begins with another time jump, and sometimes it is hard in the beginning to keep who is whom straight but the story drew me in. See a family with a lot of issues that the kids did not notice until the boyfriend of one of the children eventually writes a book based on their childhood and things begin to change. As time goes on we see shifting relationships between kids, a more understanding relationship with parents, and I really wish that there were another 100 pages since there were relationships and characters that I wanted to know more about.Fast reading book - took me about 2 days to finish this - and yet one that makes you think a lot about your childhood, your children's life and even grandchildren's life, and how we all change and adapt as life goes on. This year I read a lot of books by female authors that really made an impression on me, and this book certainly ranks up there as one of the best of 2016."

Halfway through, I had to consciously force myself to slow down in order to prolong my reading experience. There’s just something a bit magical about this book.So much of the novel is imbued with a bittersweet, melancholy feeling. Patchett expertly captures many of life’s stages: carefree childhood, adolescent and post-grad growing pains, mid-life crises, and the decline of old age. She vividly depicts the ever-changing dynamics of a blended family with all its joys and frustrations. There are also tragedies- some small and some cataclysmic. One event in particular drives much of the plot, its repercussions rippling out across the entire novel.Commonwealth is beautifully written and utterly brimming with life. It is one of my favorite reads of the year, and one that I will be thinking about for a long time to come.Full review here: https://dwellinpossibilityblog.wordpr... "
146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5788507-melodie,Rating 2 out of 5,"The sixties were a turbulent time. And the family issues displayed here certainly reflect that. Events at a christening starts the tumbler moving between two families. A long roster of characters with all their accompanying issues and interpersonal problems made this a slog for me. I found it really difficult to stay engaged except with Franny.And even then,sometimes I just wanted to scream ""Wake up!"" at her.I was engaged enough to finish the book, but in all honesty, there was some skimming going on the last twenty or so pages. This is unusual for me with this author. But not all books appeal to everyone. So I will put this one in the history books and move on."

It's only in the time since, when I've tried to think more deeply about it, that I think that it doesn't really do anything with the theme that is trumpeted across the dust jacket.

She eased her heels out of the backs of her shoes even though she knew it was a mistake. Her feet would expand like bread dough and she would never be able to cram them back in. Teresa looked back and forth between Bert and the pretty ring on her hand and thought she must be emitting light from her entire body she loved him so much. It was unnerving to remember that now, at seventy-two... She had loved Bert Cousins... and then, after he left her with four small children, she had hated him with the full force of her life.Without warning her head dropped forward and for an instant she was sound asleep. She made a small, startled sound like a dog or a pig having a dream. She sat up straight again, opened her eyes slightly to see if anyone had caught her.That's the trouble with being fifteen - all he can think of is what he doesn't want. My Review:Commonwealth was my first experience reading the masterful word craft of Ann Patchett. I was captivated and enthralled by the intricate details that wove in and out as the storyline was being expertly and cleverly constructed. I was introduced to an array of unusual, quirky, and abhorrent characters. There were so many characters that I had initially despaired I would not be able to keep them straight. However, that was never a problem as each family member was uniquely differentiated, unflinchingly and distinctly fleshed out, and interestingly described. I was fascinated by each and every one of them, although, I would not want to inhabit the same hemisphere as any of them. The majority of adults were neglectful and selfish, while the children were angry, spiteful, and ranged from overly conforming to obnoxious. Ms. Patchett cleverly exposed the underbelly and frustrations of each family member as well as their interesting oddities and endearing characteristics. The writing was whip-smart, sneaky, and highly observant. Her magical words squeezed my heart, stole my breath, and were consistently unpredictable. It was ingenious! I have since added her name to my list of favorite authors of all time. "

After the book tour event I then sat down and finished the book, with the knowledge that this is her ""most autobiographical novel"" and the story she felt she needed to tell, if only to purge it from her system.Of course, it's beautifully written, with every detail in place. It opens with the smell of oranges at a christening party that I could see, hear and even feel. But ... then it meanders back and forth over 50 years with nine (NINE!) major characters telling their side of events. I think it's all this back and forth that put me off initially - I just never felt the hook I wanted and it took my personal encounter to truly re-engage my interest.I'm so glad I did. Patchett is just the best at bringing it all together and it ended just beautifully. I still can't say I loved it (and those who know me know how much I want to love it), but I appreciate it and having thought it over for the past few days, I see the truth of this book in her and in her other novels.I will forever treasure my personalized copy and will continue to read everything she publishes. I will now do those things with a more complex adoration of one of America's greatest living writers."
151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1246157-jessica-sullivan,Rating 4 out of 5,"It took a long time for me to get into this one—approximately half of the book, to be honest. There are a lot of characters and the chapters are more like connected vignettes spanning decades to paint the picture of one large family. Then there reached a point when it all clicked into place and I finally felt invested in the characters and I was captivated from that point forward.It all begins at Franny Keatings' christening party, where her mother kisses her father's colleague, causing the dissolution of two marriages and the joining of both families and their six children.As the years pass, the children develop a genuine bond, forging deep relationships with each other that last through adulthood.Commonwealth tells the story of this interconnected family's lives, focusing on the children's connections with each other and their parents. Like most lives, theirs are filled with loss and love, regret and happiness. And through the years, they're forced to come to terms with the heavy burdens they bear.At one point in middle age, Franny realizes that she's ""unable to map out all the ways the future would unravel without the moorings of the past."" This is a poignant realization, and one of the core theses of Patchett's novel: that there's a connectedness between the events that make up a life—or a family's collective lives—and that every piece matters.Patchett is a gifted writer with keen insights into human complexities. If you're willing to give this one some time to sink its teeth into you, the payoff is worthwhile."

How preposterous is that?But then I started to really meet the four adults and six children affected by these divorces and remarriage and the book became interesting. These people were real and captivating and I was hooked.The story of the book Commonwealth (the book within a book) was pretty interesting too.I have started to write reviews so that the potential reader can meet the characters (helps the reader keep track too!!)The Keating Family (at the beginning)FIX (Francis)- father of 2 girls, married to BeverlyBeverly -married to FIX, meets BertCaroline - Daughter 1Franny - Daughter 2The Cousins Family (at the beginning)Bert (Albert)- father of 2 boys and 2 girls, married to Teresa, meets BeverlyTeresa - married to BertCal - Son 1Holly - Daughter 1Jeanette - Daughter 2Albie (Albert Jr) - Son 2Some characters are fleshed out more than others.

Wymusza w pewien sposób rozmyślanie o fabule i analizowanie własnych doświadczeń w konfrontacji ze słowami Ann Patchett. Z jednej strony to rodzinna historia niedopowiedzeń, ukrytych głęboko żali i rozdzielenia, a z drugiej opowieść o sekrecie, o zdradzie, o śmierci i związanym z nią cierpieniu. To, czego zabrakło „Dziedzictwu” to dosadny konkret, idea, która jak kotwica trzyma całość w ryzach. Bez niej poszczególne fragmenty rozmywają się, rozchodzą, przepływają między sobą i chociaż przyciągają uwagę, pomimo iż fascynują swoim nasyceniem, to ostatecznie powieść traci kontury. Szwy trzymają, ale na bardzo słabiutkich nitkach. Co nie przeszkadza jej jednocześnie czarować, snuć się po wyobraźni czytelnika, oszałamiać głębią, a czasami swoją zwyczajnością pozbawioną zbędnych podtekstów. To jedna z tych historii, która zostawia po sobie ślad, drobinki, które przenikają do czytelniczego serca – literackie odniesienia, tajemnice zabrane do grobu i zapach soku pomarańczowego, który zdeterminował przyszłość bohaterów „Dziedzictwa”.Prawie Duży Buk, powieść zbyt dobra, by przejść obok niej obojętnie."

The Keatings and the Cousins would have barely noticed each other if things were normal. But, hey someone had to screw things up... Bert had to Kiss Bev Cousins on the day of her daughter christening. And the snow ball is created and going down the hill and affecting everyone and everything. I lined how Anne can create a whole tale that spans generations and decades from a single simple accident. She talks about life, love, booze, cops and death. The progress of life and us mortals facing death at the end of the road. I enjoyed the aspect of a novel inside a novel, the Commonwealth. The aspects of a novelist changing real life events and etching them in the immortal library of life which is fiction. "

I procrastinated in picking it up, despite hearing good things, because I’m not big on family sagas and I feared it would be a bit too literary (aka boring.) Some of the negative reviews complain that nothing really happens in the book, and that can be hit or miss for me. This one was a hit! I don’t agree that nothing happens, and I found each character’s story captivating. It’s surprisingly funny, and I was wowed by Patchett’s ability to weave together humor and seriousness. I read Bel Canto many years ago and liked it. Didn’t love it. Commonwealth is way better, in my opinion. Recommend! "

I haven’t actually read any other books by her but I think after reading Commonwealth I would like to, though I felt that this was quite a strange book, all in all!There are so many characters introduced and included that my head was spinning trying to remember not only who everyone was but how they related to each other. I often had to flick backwards to try and work this out. There are so many different elements to the various families involved, because Beverley remarries several times, as do other characters, and there are of course the many children included too!Another confusing element for me was the jumps in time. Now, I love books that switch from one time to another, but this seemed to do so with absolutely no warning or indication that it was going to change. Therefore I would get ridiculously far into a chapter / paragraphs without realising it had gone back or forward in time, and then a small detail would make me realise. It left me feeling quite disorientated – the way the children (and indeed many of the adult characters) must have felt at times, so perhaps this was in some ways intentional?There were also huge pieces of information that is never provided which I really wanted to know! I felt the novel needed a bit more time set aside for it. Regardless, though, it made some parts of the book quite difficult and slow to read, so I didn’t speed through Commonwealth at the rate I often do with other books. As I continued through the story, my slight niggles with the seemingly endless characters and narrative jumps eased off a bit, and I began to appreciate more and more the amazing writing, which was – as previously mentioned – just wonderful. Patchett includes some fantastic imagery and metaphors, but without ever overdoing it. Commonwealth leaves you feeling like you’ve read something written to a truly high standard, but understatedly so, if that makes sense.I loved the idea of consequences and how one incident can affect so many people’s futures. I also enjoyed the reflective feel of the novel; some parts really made you wonder ‘what if?’ and others felt so poignant. There’s also the element of a sort of ‘story within a story’, which I really liked – I won’t say much more about it as I don’t want to give away any spoilers, but it creates quite a self-aware feeling to the novel which you can’t understand until you read it for yourself.Commonwealth is, overall, a slow burner of a story. Don’t expect an action-packed narrative; it slowly builds up to a higher level of intrigue and drama, then often dips back down again. It doesn’t feel like there’s any big crescendo moment – instead the story depicts what is probably more like real life for many readers: an ebb and flow of mistakes, loss, happiness, excitement, grief and, at times, regret. Family life is shown at its most basic and also at times if great challenges and upset. It definitely feels like a good-quality piece of fiction, which I appreciated and enjoyed, though it felt a bit disjointed at times.I would still recommend this novel, all the same – great characterisation and fabulous writing.* I won this book in a Goodreads giveaway - thank you Goodreads! I chose to write an honest and unbiased review. *"

Sometimes when reading her novels, you might think situations are far fetched, families are dysfunctional and everyone is at the verge of a nervous breakdown or outburst of craziness. But with all those crazy dysfunctional people, the author paints in a clear and appealing style modern life as it often is. Trigger warning: don’t read it if you don’t like novels on strange people that mostley are about those people without a good plot or murder mystery."
163,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7784766-karen,Rating 4 out of 5,"I had much emotion in reading this story. The siblings were perhaps my favorite part of this story. There are 4 kids from one marriage and 2 from the other. During the summers they leave their California homes and travel to Virginia to see their mother/father. They get into all kinds of things with little supervision, like walking from hotels to far off lakes by themselves. They also figure out ways to shrug off taking care of the baby of the family by giving him Benadryl which puts him to sleep. One summer the oldest child dies in a tragic accident, no one is ever the same after that.The story jumps in time from that tragic summer, no details given, to all five children in their adulthood. This story actually spans 5 decades and it is a nice ride through the years. We get to see the parents in their old age coming to terms with what happened to them and how each child dealt with the divorce and the loss of a sibling. The time jumps were a bit shocking, but I was so wrapped up in these characters that it felt really good to see where they all ended up.I loved this book enough to want to read more from the author. The writing was a bit addictive. I loved that the writing focused more on locations and emotions then the way people or things looked. I am not sure how to explain it, but it felt more like a first person experience for me, even though the writing was all in third person. There also isn’t much to mark the years for this story. The current day events could have happened at any time in history or the present, so that makes this story a bit timeless. This was a fun read that I devoured in one day. I highly recommend it for readers who enjoy mature family stories."

She grasps setting, characters, and mood so well. This book delivers on all those aspects, yet it sat as an very average read for me. 3.5 stars- Here's why.We care about the characters, of course we do, but just as you start to latch on to a moment in time the structure of the book throws a decade ahead. Or into another family, or another place. That is not my favorite experience as a reader because I tend to really attach to characters and I don't like being tossed to and fro. We are interested in the affairs and the feelings of all involved, but again- once you start to sit with one of them the author pulls you away. Some may love this writing, but it starts to become difficult to connect. I enjoyed how things played out, and seeing the way life panned out for these two very complicated families, but overall I kept thinking, 'what's the point?' I mean, is this about how people can survive neglect and lack of love? Is it about how they can't survive those things? Is it about women conquering or women wilting away? I wasn't sure. I kept trying to feel the message and tone of the book- because as a reader that is what I crave. Don't just give me a well woven web, give me an overall shot of the thread within the web, a reason to think the book was meaningful. So many readers love this book, but I'm afraid for me it was missing that overall arch of purpose. I am not even sure who I would recommend this to as I have pondered the book for the last couple days. I enjoyed the writing, Patchett is still talented in my mind, but I walk away with an average lukewarm affection for this one."
165,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47101099-nadia-king,Rating 4 out of 5,"'Commonwealth' by Ann Patchett is the story of two families that come together through beauty and heartbreak. This isn't the story of the adults insomuch as the story of the tribe of six children. It is the story of their lives and how the tragic death of one will shape the lives of the others. Told without judgment, 'Commonwealth' is the story of the web of family life; of the complicated relationships and power struggles between siblings. Patchett obviously enjoyed writing 'Commonwealth' because her delight lifts off the page which is a pleasure to behold as a reader.I found the beginning difficult to get into, especially with the sheer amount of characters, but once I identified the spine of the story, it was compelling reading. 'Commonwealth is jam packed full of beautiful one-liners. A few I just have to share:- ""If her mother hadn't been so pretty none of it would have happened, but being pretty was nothing to blame her for.""- ""You could see just a trace of the daughter there; the way she held her shoulders back, the length of her neck. It was a crime what time did to women.""- ""Always, ask the price. That can be the lesson of our time together.""-""...it was just about going forward in those days, one step, one step, not falling all the way down into myself.""- ""No one should have so much money that they could own a house like that and then not even bother to live in it.""- ""...sometimes all the right things are as useless as nothing at all.""- ""Isn't that what everyone wants, just for a moment to be unencumbered?""Highly recommended - a wonderful story of what it means to be human."
166,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/994755-kathryn-bashaar,Rating 3 out of 5,"This was a clever nested doll of a book: the author mined her own childhood to write a story about a family whose story was mined by one member's author boyfriend as material for his book. I think Patchett was saying something about our personal and family narratives. Each of us has a narrative that we tell ourselves about ourselves; to a degree, that narrative IS our self. Similarly, families have a joint narrative. ""We were all ruined by dad's drinking"" or ""We're all a little crazy; nobody knows what to make of us"" or whatever. And the narrative is a fiction of its own, or at least it's never the whole story. The Keating/Cousins family narrative starts when Bert Cousins and Beverly Keating have and affair that breaks up their marriages, and subsequently marry each other. Their six children from their first marriages are thrown into a relationship, and are often left to their own devices while the four parents deal with their own personal fallout from the marital breakups. A tragedy results from the children's independence, which becomes the lie at the heart of the family narrative. A significant lie that a family is protecting ALWAYS hurts someone. Always. I thought this book was a little vague about that. The lie didn't seem to change anyone. Caroline was still tough and in control. Franny was still passive. Albie was still troubled. Jeanette was still withdrawn and unknowable, Holly still anxious. Their childhood personalities persisted. I didn't really see the impact of the lie on them, even though it was the heart of the story. "

Commonwealth
 is a very well-written piece of fiction. Spanning five decades and two families that have been thrown together through infidelity and the new beginnings and family melding that can often bring, we have a maxed out set of characters. We have the original Cousinses: Bert and Teresa, the parents, along with Cal, Holly, Jeanette, and Albie (who is yet to be born at the birth of this novel).Then we have the original Keatings: Fix and Beverly, the parents, along with Caroline and Franny.Those two sets make up the main ingredients in the novel. Yes, there are other people, namely a Leon Posen, author of the novel-within-this-novel which is also named Commonwealth and which is also about the same people... but not (wink, wink). There are also a few smatterings of significant others and whatnot, but the main cycle of the book revolves around those ten individuals.From the very beginning, this book was interesting. We were off to a rip-roaring start where the two families collide at a christening party, no doubt—Franny's christening party. Fix meets Bert (though he's seen him around work), and Bert meets Beverly. There's a weird vibe to the party, consisting mostly of adults, and they get sloshed (but not knee-walking drunk) and Bert and Beverly exchange a kiss that starts this story into motion.It is also where the novel first slows down. I would almost say stalls out, but it doesn't, it just slows the pace down. It is as if the tone of the pages and the emotions of the characters so greatly affect the words-to-come that the pace sets itself to be in alignment.Patchett writes with a great deal of depth, injecting a delicately wry sense of humor to balance out the tragedies and melancholy found among, and created by, these ten people. I found myself pulled along on this journey, which is largely to what this novel amounts (the journey through the eyes of fewer than a dozen humans) by her writing and her characters. I wanted to know them and fill in the holes and the gaps within that fifty year time span. With a large cast of players, and nearly all of whom get a crack at being the third-person navigator, I would think that each POV change would drive me batty, because I normally find issue in a book that thrusts the change in POV to be too harsh, or happening too often, or with too great a variety of narrators, or all of the above, but Patchett was sneaky. And, this is the kind of sneaky I appreciated. The transition between narrators was often so smooth, so continuous that I didn't even realize I had crossed that threshold and was now following one of the other characters. I'd go back and forth with her and her creations without even realizing the mask and eyes and mind had been switched. I don't know that I'd ever experienced this, where the writing was so seamless in that regard.The pace of the story picked up around the halfway mark when Franny, the second youngest of the six children, meets the famed but nearly has-been novelist, Leon Posen. Franny is star-struck and they begin a May-December romance. Within the layers of their early years together, Franny willingly opens to someone willing to listen to her stories and inner-self, and it is from Franny that Leo gathers the beans she is spilling. Though Leo claims his novel, Commonwealth, rose largely from his imagination and that Franny's life story only inspired him, we know it is basically her memoir in all but authorship and her own self laid bare. Thus, we have the event that propels us into the second half of the story.From there, the story simply unfolds—though we are still walking along the nonlinear timeline. I was under the mistaken impression during certain times in the book, feeling led to this conclusion by Patchett's writing, that there was a bigger story or underlying mystery to be discovered. However, there was no hidden surprise or shocking moment waiting. I think that was my main issue with this book: I felt like I was being led towards a twisting or revealing ending. So, I kept my eye on the remaining chunk of pages, and as that chunk got smaller and smaller, I couldn't help but wonder where this novel was going after all. I was surprised when I found myself on the last page. It was only the tiniest bit deflating. Like when The Truman Show (the television show within the movie of the same name) suddenly and simply ends. The ending is found in the hidden ellipsis—the understanding that the story, though not told, continues from here. So, I suppose, there was a hidden ending after all."

The end sorta flickered and fizzled a bit, & what could've been a 5-star book was dropped to 4-stars. I've read Ann Patchett's 'State of Wonder,' which I thought was great, but similarly, something kept it from being a full five stars novel. What? I'm not sure exactly. In Commonwealth I know it was the ending, which felt anti climactic and...tangential? Superfluous. The book opens and immediately hooks you, though it's by no ""hook,"" no cheap cliff hanger or juicy tidbits. It is just naturally, easily, gracefully, through Patchett's lovely writing, & engaging style. Without even understanding why, I found myself completely enthralled, turning the pages as quickly as possible, totally immersed in the world she'd created.Ultimately, it was just a story of a family. The tribes that adults sometimes create with their divorces and remarriages, the hidden worlds of children, the secret lives that take place behind closed doors, outside of them, when the adults aren't looking. Sometimes things made me cringe, or squeezed at my heart, the audacity and tenacity and openness AND simplicity of children, how very outrageous their little ideas and lives can be. They are very simply, children, and all the while that the adults are scurrying about making messes of things, the children are forced to deal with the repercussions and make lives out of the aftermath of their parents choices. The sort of habits and grudges and alliances that come from mixed in-other-words-broken families. It wasn't a complicated storyline, wasn't particularly plot driven, nor did we get to follow much with the character's development, moving instead from childhood to adulthood, jumping from the one to the other and left to piece together what happened in between. And that's where things went sour for me, I was so engrossed in the story from the very beginning that when the end lost its sparkle, and sorta faded off into nothingness, I was left sitting there feeling like I was missing something. Okay so I get it, this story isn't about a beginning, middle, & end, it wasn't about where the story takes you but rather just the story itself, it's not about the end result, instead it's just about the people. I got that much. But for being such a circular storyline, it read no less thrilling than a thriller and I was no less glued to the pages, and I would have liked as strong as an ending as it was throughout.We can't have it all, I guess. So rarely does a reader experience true ""book love."" Like the real thing, it's rare, special, and takes the perfect blend of ingredients. Most of the time, people are misses or near hits, until every once in awhile that one person comes along and KABOOM, we're in love. It takes a special person, just like it takes a special book before we get that goldilocks ""juuuuust right"" feeling. So I guess this wasn't true book love, Commonwealth isn't my book soulmate, but it WAS an exceptionally great and wonderful book which displayed Patchett's abilities and talents. So far it's been two for two with her, which has led to my moving Bel Canto up to a much higher, to be read sooner position!If you haven't read anything by this author, you should."

Bert Cousins, from the DA’s office, seems oddly out of place in this party mostly populated by cops and their wives and children.He doesn’t even bring a gift for the baby (Frances, the daughter of Fix and Beverly Keating). Just a large bottle of gin.This man will go on to turn all their lives upside down. Yes, he had help from some of the other characters, but without actions he has taken, all of their lives would have been different.Commonwealth is a fascinating story of dysfunctional families that carries the reader from the 1960s to the present. We don’t follow the characters in a linear style, but move back and forth. Sometimes we are swept backward by a character’s memory that takes us there. And sometimes we are catapulted back by events.I was especially drawn to Fix Keating and his daughters, Caroline and Franny. But as we move along this circuitous pathway to follow each of their journeys, we see how the non-linear style works for the story. More information is yielded with each backward turn. And suddenly we are seeing some of the characters reconnect in unexpected ways as the story comes to its ending. And we are offered another glimpse into the Cousins family, a peek that we did not see before. How does Franny’s young adult relationship with an author named Leon Posen change the trajectory of their lives…again? How has Caroline controlled the narrative of tragic events that brought sadness and loss to the families? Why does Albie, Bert’s youngest, seemingly drive the story in a new direction? In one Christmas that Franny spends with her mother Beverly and another of her husbands, with his grown children, she ponders the various connections by marriage. She maps out all the ways the future would unravel without the moorings of the past. The “what ifs” in their lives keep her mind spinning.From LA to Virginia, with side journeys to Chicago and Manhattan, we see families with all their tarnished history, struggling to maintain broken bonds, even as time marches on, forcing them to face their mortality. Can they stay true to what connects them, even when they are in disarray? Will their core truths bring them peace? I loved this book, and the more I thought about it, and as I wandered along the strange pathways with the characters, I knew that I would be thinking of it for a long time. 5 stars."

I was also given her fourth novel, Bel Canto, and was surprisingly deeply disappointed in it. I have a good friend and my brother, both of whom never finished Bel Canto, and I told them they didn't miss much. Although I really liked the first 50 pages or so, I felt the remainder of the novel to be tedious and directionless. Oh well. I haven't read another Ann Patchett novel since, though I did enjoy her memoir Truth and Beauty.I had read some really good things about her latest novel Commonwealth and decided to give it a whirl. And boy am I glad that I did. It is, to put it bluntly, a wonderful, shall I say, masterful novel. It is obviously written by a seasoned and extremely confident writer, and it is very wise and emotionally rich. It is basically a series of vignettes, each chapter is of a different time and deals with different characters, all involved around two families that are melded together when the wife of one runs off with the husband of the other and moves across the country from Los Angeles to Virginia. Franny and her sister Caroline become involved with Holly, Jeanette, Cal and Albie, and after experiencing a significant occurrence, go on about their lives deeply affected by it.Because the novel is not structured sequentially, there is not as much of a tension that would occur had it been so, but the characters are so rich and the writing is so exceptionally done that the reader (at least this one) is utterly entranced and engrossed in the proceedings. Forgive me Ann Patchett for disparaging you in the past for Bel Canto, for you obviously are a magnificent writer who is worthy of all the praise that Commonwealth has received. This novel, in a very different way, rivals The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead for novel of the year."

I would love her for her descriptions of time and place, for her impeccable timing of events, and for the rhythm of her prose – even if I didn’t also love her for her subject matter, which I do. My first book of hers was STATE OF WONDER. It was one of the first audiobooks I listened to, and the reader was amazing. The same reader, Hope Davis, reads COMMONWEALTH, and adds a skillful dimension to this book.COMMONWEALTH is about family and the many shapes and forms it takes. It is a dense novel – lots of characters, lots of things going on, lots of issues. But it is absorbing, which was exactly what I needed as a distraction from politics. The story follows the lives of four adults and six children, from the 1960’s to the present, moving forward and back and forward again in time, in a way that should be confusing but isn’t. As a writer myself, I am in awe of Patchett’s skill in this. She paints characters who are fully realized and memorable, and layers them into a gripping story that needs no villain. The page-turning element comes from the twist and turns in the lives of these characters, about whom I came to care deeply.My only annoyance? The publisher’s hype refers to a kiss at a christening party between one man’s wife and another woman’s husband, that sets “into motion the dissolution of their marriages and the joining of two families.” I kept waiting through that first scene for a sudden upheaval caused by the kiss, but it never came. The kiss was only one of many precursors of the story too come. The hype-quote is a marketing line, but it gives short shrift to the depth in the book.Training its sights on blended families and why we do what we do when life throws us a curve, COMMONWEALTH captures today’s world. I’ve already found myself comparing people and events in real life to those in this book. Talk about a book staying with you …"

Full disclosure: I met up with several Booktopians in NYC and saw Ann Patchett interviewed by Emma Straub. The bonus of having Alan Alda do the reading capped a fun night and made me like the book even more. (Like Ed Hermann, he could probably do okay reading audiobooks). I had read Bel Canto and enjoyed that and State of Wonder is waiting for me, but Commonwealth made me late to dinner last night (my friends understood). There are a lot of characters and a lot of marriages, but after hearing the author speak about it and her life, it was easier to keep track of everyone. Ann Patchett lived parts of this book as she was growing up and she grew up in the 60s and 70s when our parents were not hovering over our every activity. Left to their own devices, six step-siblings managed to make their own fun, whiel fighting and keeping secrets. Told mostly from the point of view of Franny, the younger of 2 sisters, we learn the story of the dissolution of her parents' marriage and the subsequent reverberations out to several other families. Patchett has chosen her scenes carefully, skipping through time and trusting the reader to fill in the gaps (I would love to take credit for that insight, but she told us that in NYC). She is an excellent writer and makes you feel the weather, light and place in each scene. The story probably could have been a little less populated, but at the end, of all the difficult families I spent time with, these characters were my favorites."

La historia es la siguiente; un día cualquiera un fiscal del estado sale de casa, donde está su esposa y sus hijos, porque necesita desconectar y decide presentarse al bautizo de la hija de un policía, que no es amigo suyo y que ha oído por casualidad que se celebraba entonces. Años más tarde (y sin que el lector lo presencie) tenemos que el fiscal se ha casado con la mujer de ese policía, con lo que se han roto dos familias y se ha creado una de nueva. Los hijos de los dos matrimonios conviven juntos los veranos y es en uno de estos veranos cuando sucede algo horrible que les marca para siempre. La historia está narrada por capítulos que en principio parecen inconexos y en cada uno de ellos el narrador es un personaje distinto. Al principio es lenta, pero después los capítulos van enlazándose y casi sin que te des cuenta todo toma forma. Para rizar el rizo, dentro de la novela encontramos un personaje que escribe una novela que se llama ""Comunidad"" donde se narra la misma historia que estamos leyendo. Lo dicho, una obra de ingeniería literaria. Personalmente no le doy cinco estrellas porque me habría gustado que hubiera más capítulos centrándose en ciertos personajes (no digo cuáles para no desvelar el misterio) y menos de otros.Si os gusta la narrativa elaborada y las historias de familias ""disfuncionales"" os lo recomiendo mucho."

I don't know what it is about her writing. It feels literary, but then also has a great plot, and feels accessible, down to earth, and contemporary. Sometimes I feel like she's writing just for me. Extremely narcissistic, but when an author can make you feel that way, it's very powerful.As for this book, I really enjoyed it. The characters are flawed and imperfect, yet beautiful, complex, and oh so frustrating. Just the way I like my family drama! The book jumps around in terms of time and point of view, so I can see why some people have found it confusing. There are no names at the beginning of each chapter to let you know who is speaking, and there is no date listed. And yet, I was able to follow it perfectly and found the jumping around to be interesting and not distracting at all.I know that some elements of this book are extremely autobiographical. But instead of trying constantly to figure out what was truth and what was fiction, I lost myself in the book and the characters and the story and just allowed myself to be guided along. That shows what a great writer Patchett is. The story feels very unique and not just like every other family drama. And most importantly, I really cared about these characters and what happened to them. I will miss them now that the book is over."

The premise was so promising.The crux of the books happens when Franny tells her lover, an older, wiser famous author, the story of her family- how her mother left her father for another man, Bert. Bert and Beverly then sent an earthquake through their families, combining their 6 children and separating everyone...and the book really is just a patchwork of anecdotes switching between flashbacks and present day. It's hard to keep track of who is who and where in the timeline of their lives the book is talking about. There's often no transition between stories which was confusing. And when that book is published, there are a lot of secrets that the children have been trying to keep from their parents. How much pain can the past actually cause? That's a really interesting question... There's enough questions that I wanted answered that kept me reading but it almost wasn't enough for me. "
187,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11751450-stephanie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett pushes beyond her already superlative storytelling skills to weave the story of an ""unblended"" family over time and geography. The story begins with the arrival of Albert Cousins, an uninvited guest to the christening of Franny Keating. His good looks and savoir faire attract the beautiful young mother, Beverly, like a butterfly to a flame. A shared kiss, the baby Franny held between them, ignites a tale of divorce and recoupling, inattentive bicoastal parenting, and sets in motion the lives of their six children -- four Cousins, two Keatings -- as the move from childhood to early middle age. The story is told lightly, with shifting perspectives, through a broken time frame that cleverly foreshadows mayhem and withholds vital details. Best if read quickly, keeping a careful accounting of the names and histories of the many characters, ""Commonwealth"" is cleverly written, filled with laugh-out loud observations about its feet-of-clay characters. Patchett is at the top of her form. ""Commonwealth is a lips-smacking piece of American pie."

I was patient. I just had a feeling Patchett had plans, including serving up a massive payload at some point. I didn't mind that the book glosses over decades, shifts POVs, and is told in completely nonlinear vignettes. I was down until about half-way through, when my interest began to nosedive. Some of the imagery is remarkably vivid, like the Keating's christening party (where everyone starts juicing oranges), the unattended Keating-Cousins children (finding their father's gun and drugging up the youngest brother with Benadryl so they don't have to watch him), and Franny Keating becoming a reluctant Hamptons hostess.Shortly after Franny's stint in the Hamptons, though, I checked out. I could see where it was going, and I just didn't care. I finished it, but wasn't particularly happy I bothered.This was going to be 3 stars because I enjoyed the first half, but I think it's being too generous."

I have been in a horrible reading slum, falling 10 books behind on my reading goal because most of the books I end up reading end up being underwhelming. Needless to say, Ann Patchett's ""Commonwealth"" knocked me off my feet and woke me up out of my slumber. I am such a fan of storyline that follows families over a number of years and Patchett did a spectacular job of tying these families together in the neatest most messiest bow ever. I don't want to give a lot away, but the story starts when a DA shows up randomly to a cop's daughter christening and what happened after will blow your mind.A genuinely fun, gripping and interesting read. A totally different feel from Bel Canto but if you loved that book you will definitely enjoy this one. Read it, it is worth the hype!"

I just expected more. I didn't *dislike* this book, but I can't say I really liked it either. I listened to it on Audible, so my confusion with the characters and what family they belonged too might be attributable to my inability to page back to get my bearings. But confusion aside, I just didn't care about any of them all that much. There just wasn't anything to really like (or dislike). ""The big mystery"" was no big deal at all -- lending credibility, I suppose. But I found it boring. My ambivalence, along with my expectations from the author led to the 2-star rating."

Also had issues with character development and keeping track of who was who. Who was meant to be the main character. Starts with Bert and Fix, they go into background, and the story focuses on the children Frannie, Albie, Cal, Caroline, and Jeanette. Seemed like the story was just all over the place.

Is it as good as the last two books I read by her, ""The Magician's Assistant,"" and ""State of Wonder,"" which I thought were near PERFECT?!! I don't think so. Is as as good as the four previous books I read by her? Most Definitely!!! Ms. Patchett is a major talent. ""Commonwealth,"" is about the America I was surrounded by for over thirty years in beautiful southern California. Thankfully, I was never a part of it when growing up in the Bronx, nor did I fall into its trap when living in Los Angeles. The culture of Los Angeles through the 80's, 90's and into the second decade of this century was one of divorce, broken families, and dysfunction. When I asked a friend, how often he talked to his parents he replied, ""Probably every six months."" I talked to my parents, when telephone rates were high when calling long distance at least once a week if not twice. When the rates dropped, I might talk to them and my brothers 4 or 5 times a week. I made at least two trips home every year and sometimes as many as 5 or six. Some of my friends visited their parents maybe once every 4 or five years, but they always told me how much they loved them. Most of these friends I am talking about had parents who were divorced, some a few times over, and they all had stepbrothers and stepsisters.""Commonwealth,"" is about this dysfunction, and the effect it has on children and parents when they get older. Like all of Ms. Patchett's books, this novel is powered by characters on steroids, beautifully writing, and a knowledge of her surroundings that is breathtaking. Highly, Highly Recommend."

This is my second Patchett. My first was Bel Canto. And it was unfair to expect something as moving as that, but I kept expecting this book to sink its claws in me at some point and it kinda just never happened.I almost really cared about the characters, but didn’t quite.I wish the book had focused more on the children rather than the parents, I think. I cared for Albie and Franny most. Holly’s chapter was unfortunately very boring. Jeanette’s not very insightful to her own character, and Caroline doesn’t really get one (she kinda shares with Franny.)I think Fix could have been the one to deliver the big emotional impact I was looking for but it just never got there.Anyway, not a bad read.

The magic starts from it's immaculate language that wraps you up and makes you feel being with the characters and sometimes yourself being the character. And after I'd been enchanted by the way Ann Patchett narrates the plot, I started appreciating the story itself. It's multilayered and deceptively simple - life story of two families over a span of 50 years. Actually, it's very well thought out. Every single phrase plays an important role in the narration. Every character is complex and profound so that reader scan identify themselves with at least one of the members of the families. As for me, I can relate to almost everyone.I can highly recommend audio version narrated by Hope Davis. With the slightest changes of the pitch of her voice she adds a lot to every character. I particularly enjoyed her interpretation of Beverly, she made this beautiful woman so vivid!"

But she is up to something far more subtle, startling and painful than that. There is nothing inevitable or fated here, unless it is that actions have consequences, most of which are unintended. A person might seem “unbearable”, but then the narrating mind suggests, “maybe that’s the real problem”, that a person who seems unbearable may rather be “emblematic of what can never be overcome”. When the whole tragic power of her story hits the reader, about two-thirds of the way through, the effect is physically breathtaking. Patchett sucker-punches you, but leaves you feeling you had it coming – whether for underestimating her, or her characters, or humanity, is hard to say.*
 okay. now that that is out of my system... :)i love ann patchett. so much. i tend to go into her books hoping i will love them, but i do try to keep my expectations in check, and approach each book freshly and with an open mind. of course, as a patchett fan, it was near-impossible to not be excited about this new novel. heck, it's been one of my most anticipated reads for 2016. and my curiosity was heightened through interviews AP has given, noting this is her first autobiographical novel. that did add an interesting layer to the reading, along with the whole meta thing going on -- the novel features a novelist who has written a new work of ""fiction"", based on the life of the main characters of AP's book. his novel is also called 'commonwealth'. are you with me still? excellent! this all worked wonderfully for me because i am basically a sucker for any works of fiction which feature writers and writing. i'm not predisposed to automatically liking them all, but i am predisposed being intrigued by these kinds of books and throwing them onto Mt. TBR.what i find patchett does exceptionally well are the nuances and dynamics of family (She didn't know how to hate her mother yet, but every time she left her father crying in the airport she came that much closer to figuring it out.) and the excavation of the idea of responsibility. (actions have consequences.) she's an insightful writer. she's also very funny, albeit sometimes it's a dark-funny (The priest, whose mind was wandering like the Jews in the desert... or ...people moved to Brooklyn to fall in love and write novels and have children, not to get old, and she couldn't go to Holly, though she imagined dying in the Zen centre might come with spiritual advantages.), which i can fully appreciate. and when themes can get heavy or sad, those moments of levity are terrifically appreciated. i hugely respect how patchett creates complicated, messy characters. i feel as though she is writing openly and realistically when she creates characters who could be hard to embrace by some readers, but i also feel she has tremendous empathy for those she is creating.my only real criticism of the novel is that i would have loved a bit more depth/story from each of the members of the keating-cousins families. jeannette, for example, who completely intrigued me. and albie. oh, albie. but, really, apart from franny who functions as the novel's centre and presented as a more complete character (save for one thing that was really left dangling), i would have been down for so much more on this whole family. but -- that is just my very minor quibble. i was so engaged with the book, and fairly tore through it as i had a hard time putting it down. so, i hope you will read this book, and that you will let me know what you think when you do. i think this will be a book i recommend to many people.* -- excerpted from sarah churchill's uber-gushy review in the guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/books/201..."

The novel is such a sink-in-and-read that it feels like a total zone-out.And then, all of a sudden, you’re at 50 percent and you’re like “Oh, wait. I'm reading? And Cal's ... dead?”The ease comes from the structure. These smooth ride stories from within two families who become linked by a right place, right time -- or wrong place, wrong time -- almost fluke. They cross time and space and one minute there are parentless kids cruising toward a beach and packing heat and the next minute an old woman is considering the time she went to Switzerland to sit quietly next to her daughter. I suppose that is an accurate portrayal of time.It all starts with Bert, who is looking for any excuse to avoid his ever-growing family, so he crashes the christening for a colleague-ish’s newborn baby, Franny. He saves the day with his gift for the hosts, a mega bottle of booze that seemingly has a water-to-wine biblical property, and eventually he finds himself having a quick, somewhat chaste romantic liaison with the lady of the house.Game on: The two end up leaving his kids and ex behind in Los Angeles and taking her brood to live in Virginia.We revisit the members of these families over the course of the next 50-some years in non-chron short-story sized bites that delve deeper into the major family moments for the individuals.Its most intriguing character who is Franny, who doesn’t want what it takes to become a lawyer like her sister and almost her father. She’s bookish and would prefer to read, read, constantly read. She’s working at a restaurant when one of her favorite writers settles into the bar and asks her for a drink.A flashback finds the step-siblings on a hot beach-bound day. Their parents are asleep at the hotel with instructions to let them keep snoozing, please. So they embark on their own adventure armed with the necessities: soda, Benedryl and the handgun the eldest boy pulls from the glove box.Albie is the kid brother nobody wanted who becomes the kid brother nobody can find -- until he shows up at his big sister’s Brooklyn apartment and no one ever wants him to ever leave again. He coincidentally ends up reading about his family’s greatest tragedy, a story he barely knew the half-of, until it plays out in fiction written by ba-dump-bump, the aforementioned author at the bar. I liked so much of this book, but other parts felt overburdened with names and more names and more marriages to characters who don’t mean anything to the story. Some of the players are lean and blah and some -- but not many -- of the chapters feel like filler. Part of the problem is the through-line, the story of Dead Cal, which is a wisp of an idea that doesn’t feel real or weighty or gut-punchy enough. Two words, Patchet: My. Girl.Mostly I just want to read about Franny and her old white man author boyfriend and the summer at the A-Listers place. Because that was going to get ugly and lo did I want to watch it play out. "

I was on the hold list at the library, so I thought I could wait until I got home to read it, but when I saw the “Signed First Edition” sticker, I knew that hardcover was destined for my bookshelf.I finished reading it once we got home, and while it didn't quite live up to my (Mount Olympus-level) expectations, it was an excellent family drama in the same vein as Ann Packer's The Children's Crusade, which was one of my favorite books of 2015. The slow-motion car wreck of the two married parents' affair, and the resulting blended family and their eyebrow-raising interactions were riveting. I think where it fell short for me was the development of the central relationship itself, between Bert and Beverly. I never felt like I really understood why they each gave up everything to be together. I never, ever say this, but I almost wish the book had been longer—Patchett could have given herself a little more space that way to really sell the attraction between them.

207,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I love Ann Patchett. I enjoy both her fiction and her non-fiction, and believe that I would probably love her company too. Her characters are always well-drawn. I was delighted to find out that she had another book coming out. Commonwealth is not a book to read if you're looking for linear plot. It is more of a portrait of a big, complicated blended family, their dramas and their secrets. A kiss that happens at a baptism among the child's mother and an uninvited guest is the spark that sets the entire story into action. Families reshuffle, and the six step-siblings spend every summer together, getting into trouble and running wild in Virginia until something bad happens.We follow each of these characters through adulthood, though the story focuses mostly on Franny - a law school dropout, who finds herself getting to know a famous writer. A lot happens here, but again, it's not really linear.I without a doubt, recommend this book. I loved the characters, with all their flaws and loyalties. I loved the details she slipped into the story. I liked spending time with the Keatings and the Cousins and watching their relationships play out. Thank you Harper and Edelweiss for the advance copy. I truly enjoyed this one."

I was actually intrigued by the inside flap blurb: a chance encounter among work colleagues leads to an affair and the blending of two families. This family story is revealed, in what is hinted to be less than accurate depiction (a little unreliable narrator action, maybe?), when one of the now-adult kids starts an affair with a famous author.But this affair that seems like it should be a developmental device was only alluded to briefly at 50%. And it left me with horrid flashbacks of Atonement and how much I HATED THAT FREAKING BOOK. So perhaps death by association.The story jumped around in a completely illogical manner. It was like being on a roller coaster; I literally got whiplash. But ultimately, I just didn't care. I didn't care about the thin plot. I didn't care about the characters. I didn't care to finish the book.

Vietomis stebėjausi, kiek mažai gauna dėmesio iš tėvų, kaip labai greitai jiems teko tapti savarankiškiems. Buvo ir skaudžių išgyvenimų. Ir vis tik, kas gražiausia, kad jie Vieningieji, visi tie žmonės, vaikai, susipynusios šeimos. Jie Vieningi. Ir nors knygoje daug veikėjų, bet skaitant atidžiai jie nesusimaišo. Patiko, kad apie kiekvieną buvo parašyta kaip susiklostė jų gyvenimas.🖋️ Pusę dalykų šiame gyvenime mielai prisiminčiau, o kitą pusę - mielai užmirščiau.🖋️ Tai, kas kartą atsitiko, net labai gali atsitikti ir dar kartą.🖋️ Tai, ko tau būtinai reikia, prireikus niekad nebūna po ranka.🖋️ Eidami į bagažo išdavimo skyrių pasiimti lagaminų, jie laikėsi susikibę už rankų, o kai laukė prie nuolaidaus sidabraspalvio krovinių latako, jis pabučiavo ją, pabučiavo sodriai, į lūpas, ir nė motais jiems buvo, jei kas nors ir spokso: jie buvo susituokę, jie buvo Paryžiuje."
210,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly,Rating 4 out of 5,"A beautifully orchestrated novel with a multigenerational cast of (mostly) distinguishable and interesting characters. (Think a less-twisted but more realistically-damaged Brady Bunch-clan in which the exes don’t fall off the stage but partially recombine like DNA and all four parents are too busy with their own lives to pay attention to the kids, and the kids direct their anger at their parents instead of each other and everyone turns out more-or-less okay but not without a few tragedies along the way.) The plot was sweeping, but always character-focused and domestically-centered, played out over a forty-year temporal timeline. The story is essentially linear but told in flashbacks, flashforwards, and subtle foreshadowing, sprinkled with enough red herrings to keep the reader surprised; anchored and balanced by two parties on opposite coasts hosted by the same character who spends much of each party in her kitchen."

“Your mom doesn't know about the movie, does she?""""My mom doesn't know about the book,"" he said. ""It turns out a novel isn't the worst place to hide things.”
I've never read Ann Patchett before, but based on Commonwealth, I'd happily go back for more. Reading other reviews, this kind of family drama doesn't seem to be Patchett's usual oeuvre (and from reading these other reviews I've learned that this is the first time she's written about her own family dramas), but even without prior exposure it's plain to see that this book is a mature work by a talented author. Although the line-by-line writing didn't dazzle me (something I usually insist on to grant four-plus stars), the construction and overall effect of the narrative definitely pushes my reading experience from “like” to “love”. As it was the surprises along the way that most delighted me, I'll try hard to not reveal any spoilers, but it would probably be better for any potential readers to go into this book as cold as I did. 
The six children held in common one overarching principle that cast their potential dislike for one another down to the bottom of the minor leagues: they disliked their parents. They hated them. 
Commonwealth might almost be thought of as a collection of related short stories, each long chapter being a self-contained vignette plucked from the narratives of two entwined families. As the book begins, Fix and Beverly Keating are hosting a christening party for their daughter Franny when Bert Cousins arrives, uninvited and barely known to the host, with a large bottle of gin and a desire to escape the Sunday afternoon family time expected of him by his pregnant wife and three young children. As the reader is thrown into the medias res of a scorching afternoon full of characters we'll only barely glimpse before moving on, the brief spotlight shone upon Beverly – is she, in her yellow sundress and French twist, really the most beautiful woman anyone there would have seen in real life? – and on boyish Bert in his shirtsleeves – compliantly hand-squeezing every orange plucked from every neighbourhood tree – alerts (alarms?) the reader that something transformative is afoot; yet it all ends so gently and innocently. This opening salvo was a perfectly glittering and satisfying introduction, so I was totally jarred when the next chapter is fifty years in the future, and in a conversation about the events of that first chapter between Franny and Fix, she says to her father, “Hey, you never told me that part of the story before”, and reveals that everything might not have been as it seemed. In this way, each chapter concerns family stories (as they happen or in retrospect), and often, a character will remark this this is the first time she's hearing of something or noting when it was he first learned something that was assumed to have been a family secret. 
All the stories go with you, Franny thought, closing her eyes. All the things I didn’t listen to, won’t remember, never got right, wasn’t around for. All the ways to get to Torrance.
On the other hand, a chapter about the six young children wanting to go to the lake while their parents are napping starts as a foreboding tale – A gun? A bottle of gin? A baggie of Benadryl? – and I was intensely interested to know what was going to happen. The fact that it all turns out fine is a huge misdirection for when later these same elements – the gun, the gin, the Benadryl – lead to a tragedy. It takes the entire book to circle back and fill in the details of the fateful afternoon that would change everyone's lives; and again, this leads to an examination of family stories and who knows what and who can keep a secret.
“There’s no protecting anyone,” Fix said, and reached over from his wheelchair to put his hand on hers. “Keeping people safe is a story we tell ourselves.” 
 And here's the spoilerish bit that I didn't see coming but is nagging at me to be acknowledged: When she's in her twenties – freshly dropped out of Law School and at loose ends – Franny meets and becomes involved with Leon Posner; a famous ageing novelist whose work Franny had studied intensely as an English Major undergrad. Over time, Franny tells Leon the story of her tumultuous childhood – including the details of the tragedy that the children swore to keep secret – and although she wasn't totally surprised when he used her story as inspiration for his next novel, entitled “Commonwealth”, the book's release has a not unexpected impact on her siblings. Since, as already noted, this is the first of Patchett's own novels in which she uses the details of her own tumultuous childhood, it's hard to tell if the use of the Leon character is more apology or explanation: when it comes to family stories, who owns them? Is all of fiction a type of exploitation? When one of the (now adult) children confronts Leon for depicting him without permission, the author is adamant that even if all of the details are lifted directly from Albie's childhood, the resulting story is a product of his own imagination. There's something to think on further there. And a quibble: it's stated that neither Fix or Teresa ever read the book or saw the incriminating part of the movie (although Jeanette apparently told her mother the truth years earlier), but it's never noted one way or the other whether Beverly or Bert discovered the truth about the tragedy because of Leon's book; any fallout would seem to have been an important part of the family stories, but it's totally absent. Did not even one friend or relative of the parents ever stumble across an award-winning novel written by Franny's one-time lover, recognise the part of the story they would have known, and think to comment, “That's a heck of a thing that actually happened that day”? 
Life, Teresa knew by now, was a series of losses. It was other things too, better things, but the losses were as solid and dependable as the earth itself. 
And that's the thing about family stories: it's the losses and hardships that make for the best storytelling, and the circular nature in which Patchett brings the full narrative of these to light in Commonwealth is a fine bit of craftsmanship. I was never bored – often intensely interested – and she had much of interest to say about families and relationships and all the ways we fail each other. I will definitely pick her up again."
223,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett falls into that category of authors who can do no wrong. It’s all quality with them and I can approach any book blindly and like it. As you can guess the same happened with Commonwealth.The novel starts at a christening party, where an uninvited guest makes out with the host’s wife. This action leads to a reshaping of destinies and the whole book focuses on the lives of these two families.In some ways Commonwealth is episodic. Each chapter is about one of the 6 children who are affected by their parents separations and re-couplings or one of the 4 adults and how they are coping with their new lives. At first Commonwealth feels a bit scattered but then Patchett drops little links and as the reader proceeeds a full story and timeline emerges.Death, sickness, love, marriage, mixed races, divorce and the passing of time all feature in the book. Think of it as Jonathan Franzen’s Freedom crossed with Jennifer Egan’s A Visit from the Goon Squad. It’s just as poignant as well.Due to the semi-episodic nature of Commonwealth, there are certain chapters which stand out. I thought the romance between one of the girls and an author was excellent. There’s a bit of a prodigal child narrative in one chapter and that gave me the shivers. Not to mention the penultimate chapter, which floored me. Mind you, the whole book is great but there will be some sections which will hit hard.Ann Patchett has written another superb novel, as I have heard positive things about 2019’s The Dutch House (which I will be reading once it comes out in cheapo paperback), I am assuming that her spark isn’t out yet.

That is the only way I think I can sum up my feelings.I had read/heard such great reviews of this book - with everyone praising it so much. And this is what made me skeptical to read it as more than often I end up disliking a book that is popular with almost everyone. This is the reason why it sat on my bookshelf for almost a year!But I put all my doubts aside and finally I picked it up. It took some time for this story to grow on me (around fifty to hundred pages) but after that I could not put this book down. I waited every day to get back from work and read it. I can't really say what I loved about this book - I don't know.... I just know that I loved it. I bought this book because I had heard positive reviews of it and because it is really beautiful book (and I love to own pretty books :D). But am glad that it turned out to be beautiful book with a great story.This is my first book from Ann Patchett and she is really fantastic. The narration goes back and forth in time with perspectives of every character but no way the story gets chaotic - that just goes on to show how talented the author is.Totally loved Commonwealth and I regret not reading it earlier. A great must read book!

Copious amounts of gin are consumed, leading to an illicit kiss. This brief encounter, in the kitchen, sets off a chain-reaction, breaking apart two families, and bringing them together again, with pieces missing or askew. Loosely, based on Patchett's own tumultous childhood, the novel spans five deacades, looking closely at the lives of all six children and the parents. Yes, some are dysfunctional, groping their way to an uncertain future and others are more sure-footed. Unlikely friendships evolve among the siblings and some end up, hopelessly out of reach.This book caught me by surprise, with it's depth, sense of humor and uncanny insight, into the human condition. And of course, the prose is delicious. Patchett's work seems to be divisive, among readers, including this one but that leaves me somewhat baffled, because I think she is one of the best American writers working today."

It's my thing with Ann Patchett. I love her writing so much! Then I ask... 'wait a second, what did I just read?'Patchett cares so much about family, the ties that bind, family we have versus the family we choose, etc... and her passion comes across in her writing. Just sit back and relax with this one. Nothing explosive will happen, there is very little by way of suspense or drama, but man, what a lovely read!This is a story about families breaking up and coming together, and how the children help each other survive. There's much resentment and bitterness and there's also forgiveness and acceptance. The story follows Fix and Beverly and their kids Caroline and Franny, and Bert and Teresa and their kids Cal, Holly, Jeanette, and Albie. Beverly and Bert end up together and the family becomes blended.Once again, I'm kicking myself for reading the book description, because it once again lead me to expect some serious reckoning, some serious grappling, and very forceful coming to terms-ing. This is the thing about Patchett's writing though... SHE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FORCEFULLY! She lets her characters organically interact and the feelings come across because of how well she writes conversation and little interactions.I'll let Patchett herself describe her own book:It was about the inestimable burden of their lives: the work, the houses, the friendships, the marriages, the children, as if all the things they'd wanted and worked for had cemented the impossibility of any sort of happiness.If it weren't written by Patchett, it would have been depressing and downtrodden and awful. Thankfully, it was written by Patchett. Because yeah, at the end of the day, the pursuit of everything they were supposed to want pretty much only served to make every single character miserable. And yet! At the end, you still felt like their love (or at least support) for each other would carry them through.Compared to The Dutch House in particular, sibling love was a big part of this book, BUT, with so many more siblings, Commonwealth didn't give me as much time with each sibling. As with her other books, I was once again amazed at how each chapter, which was told from the perspective of a different character, had a different voice, a different tone, and you were transported for each chapter to a different mindset and time and place. BUT, again, there were too many characters. I wanted to spend much more time with Albie in particular, as well as a few other characters, who should have been major, and ended up being very minor just by virtue of their low page count (like Fix, Jeanette, etc...).At the end of the day, I felt bad giving Dutch House 4 stars, but I said I wouldn't need to ever read it again. This one I didn't like as much as Dutch House, so I have zero qualms giving this one 4 stars. I would even say it's 3.75, because of some really unsavory characters that were irredeemable, and just too many characters to be able to focus properly on them all. Still, read it, enjoy it, because it's Patchett!"

Listening to the audio, it really caught me off guard. However, I really liked this book. I'm picky about contemporary fiction. Since finding Goodreads and the fantasy genre, I seem to like CF less and less. I tend to not like the characters, or I just find them unbelievable. It has to be a really strong storyline for me to like a book where I can't relate or bring myself to care about the characters. This book had all the things I like. I liked the characters, and I cared about them. I also found the storyline to be believable having grown up in a similar situation. I even found myself feeling empathy toward the characters who I didn't like. I'm not going to rehash the story. The blurb tells what it's about. I'll look back at this review to remember the story, so I'll add a few things to jog my memory. Bert Cousins shows up at Franny Keating's christening party uninvited. He brings a big bottle of gin. He and all the previously sober guests start drinking this and other quickly gathered alcohol from the surrounding houses. It is a beautiful day in southern California and they use fresh squeezed orange juice as a mixer. Things happen. One of those things is that Bert, kisses Franny's beautiful mother Beverly, who is currently married to Franny's dad. Bert is also married. The Cousins and Keating family's lives are forever changed. I really enjoyed the stories of the children. Franny and Caroline Keating and Cal, Holly, Jeanette and Albee Cousins. We watch their shared childhood and each of their individual stories as they grow up and start adult lives of their own. We also follow the parents. Fitz Keating and Theresa Cousins are also part of the story. This was a very good audio and I was engaged the entire time. As mentioned above, the ending could have been stronger. However, if you're looking for a good family drama, I recommend this book. I have also read and enjoyed Bel Canto so will most likely read more by her."
233,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7029980-katie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Summary: I adore Ann Patchett's writing and her plots always interest me, but the endings of her books always feel anticlimactic to me.When Bert Cousin decided to crash Franny Keating's christening party, he had no intention of kissing her mother. That one, unpremeditated act however, ended both of their marriages and irreversibly altered the lives of their children. Through five decades and one tragic accident, the Cousin and Keating children became a tight-knit group. The many issues hidden under the surface of their relationships were largely ignore until Franny's affair with famous author Leon Posen lead to his publication of a book revealing their story.I've read two of Ann Patchett's previous books, Bel Canto and State of Wonder, drawn in by their fascinating plots and gorgeous covers. In both cases, as with this book, I fell in love with Patchett's writing. Her skill is largely beyond my ability to describe. Her writing is just precisely how I expect writing to be. It's beautiful and so engrossing that I'm still completely absorbed in the story as I enjoy her writing. I don't know how she does it.The reason I would give four, not five, stars to this book and the previous two that I've read is that felt that something was missing. I haven't reviewed the previous two books because I couldn't figure out what that was. I think I can finally explain it. I am simply always expecting something more in terms of the plot. More of a big reveal, more climactic of a confrontation, more dramatic of an ending. Like Neil Gaiman, before I discovered The View From the Cheapseats, Ann Patchett is an author I will probably continue to try again and again until I find the book that works for me. Her writing is so fantastic, I'm certain she can write a book that take my breath away. I just haven't found it yet.This review was originally posted on Doing Dewey"

I've not read everything she has written but I'm working on it...State of Wonder, Bel Canto (which was incredible as evidenced by all its awards) and my favorite, This is the Story of a Happy Marriage. Her latest gift to us, Commonwealth, was a simply breathtaking addition to her growing library. For those of you who've never read her, I'd love to be able to give you a sense of her talent but it's hard. She is delicate, a storyteller who takes her time exploring characters and their inner fears, demons, dreams. She is nuanced, with observations of the human condition from the perspective of those in the inner sanctum. She is clever without being too obnoxious about it. And generally, the plot hinges on an event, on a moment, that changes everything.In Commonwealth, Burt Cousins ambles into the christening party of Franny Keating with a bottle of gin, knowing almost nobody. But he is desperate to get away from his wife and the chaos of young children in the house, so he takes advantage of the excuse. Amidst too much alcohol, dancing and angry spouses, Burt kisses Franny's mother, and becomes the catalyst that thrusts the families into divorce and the children together in a lifelong bond. Spanning over fifty years, we watch each member of the family experience heartache, loss, love and awakening. Reading this novel is like living WITH the family. The reader is a part of their lives, a fly on the wall. As the audio was ticking down to the last minutes, I began to panic. Three minutes was not enough time to wrap this up! I wanted more. It was that beautiful.Speaking of beautiful, Hope Davis. She narrated State of Wonder as well as Commonwealth, and in both, she shines. (FYI she also narrated Anna Quindlen's Every Last One, the audio that blew it's readers' minds). She's not the kind of narrator that bedazzles with singing, accents and theatrics. She's just a solid actor with a voice that makes you feel comfortable in her presence. She makes listening a true pleasure."

I completely underestimated this book. The story is nothing groundbreaking - family saga that spans generations, but the unique selling point in this case is the addition of a pesky author who gets far too involved with this family's life. I picked it up simply because I'd forgotten to take a second book to work one day and having finished the one book I had on me, picked this one up from my locker for the train home. The first chapter didn't wow me, and I was convinced it was going to be a mediocre read. How wrong I was!Patchett has a beautiful turn of phrase, and she can make even the most everyday moments sound like poetry. I also really enjoyed how this book jumped about in a non-linear fashion. While many books do this, they usually clearly signpost what period of time you're now in, usually at the start of each chapter. Commonwealth does not do this, and it makes it all the more compelling as there is some element of putting the pieces together for yourself. As I don't like being spoonfed or told what to think when I read, this was right up my street and really kept me excited to keep reading! It's also such a wittily self-referential book - I can't say anything else without spoilers, but let's just say there were many moments that left me saying ""oh Ann Patchett, you crafty lady!"".I've not read any of Patchett's other books, but I've had Bel Canto sitting on my shelves for years and I definitely feel more compelled to pick it up now.Also, I'm calling it now: this is going to be nominated for the 2017 Baileys Prize."

I respect Ann Patchett as an author, have read most of her books. This would be a second tier AP book for me, Bel Canto is a first tier book that I still think about years later. Yet, a second tier AP books is better than most authors' best efforts. Her books remain distinctive in my memory, her writing voice is clear, recognizable, distinctive. I think about how the people around Hemingway must have felt when The Sun Also Rises came out, all their embarrassing secrets and foibles out there for the world to see. And to have it happen within a family, after a tragedy...intolerable. I love her personal touches that make each character stand out in my mind's eye. I think about the unsupervised gang of kids that I ran with as a child in the summers, the mean and torturous things we did to each other, the rites of passage to prove ourselves. Parents never seem to know about the secret lives of children, and seem to forget what their own childhoods were like. My parents were shocked when my best friend and I reminisced about the milder adventures of our childhoods. Once we got access to horses and were able to range the countryside, we had some real adventures that turned out well but could have gone terribly awry. We learned to deal with things independently. I wonder how kids in this era of helicopter parenting fare. 4.5 stars. Highly recommended. "

Beverly is a young and beautiful mother and Fix is your average guy. The party seems to be going well until Bert Cousins walks into the party. He's uninvited and carrying with him a bottle of gin, which is obviously a strange christening gift, but surprisingly it goes over well with the crowd at the party. Bert immediately becomes enamored with Beverly despite the fact they are both married. In fact, they share a stolen kiss at the party. Fast forward some time and they are actually married and have left their marriages. Things aren't easy though. Bert has kids of his own as does Beverly, so their matrimony is very Brady Bunch, especially when they are all together in Virginia. Commonwealth follows this family and the many ups and downs as years go by. There's tragedy, there's secrets, and a whole lot of family drama in Ann Patchett's latest novel. Fans of multi-generational novels as well as family dramas will enjoy this well-written novel the most.Read the rest of my review here: http://www.confessionsofabookaddict.c..."

I saw this on display in the library, in the bookstore, all over the internet - this book showed up everywhere! I don't like to miss out on good reads - see what I did there? - so I gave it a try, even though the premise seemed very uninteresting to me. This is a good example of why I should trust my instincts. I just don't care about this book at all. It was boring, I made zero connection with the families, the writing was hard for me to read fluidly, and the time changes were annoying and unnecessarily confusing. It all fell flat.Months from now, the only thing I will remember about this book is the

It sits on my shelf and taunts me. I think there must be something wrong with me for not liking it. When Commonwealth was released I thought I would give Ann Patchett another try. At first, I wasn't feeling it. I had a hard time keeping the families straight. I thought the writing was choppy at the beginning and it just left me cold. I felt she kept the readers on the outside and never really welcomed them in. But something changed. I don't know where in the story it happened, but I got sucked in. I started caring for the characters. Though her writing style seemed sparse her characters finally came alive. Their stories seemed real and I cared about them.

Now I know Rachmaninoff himself was not that groundbreaking, and that perhaps the quotation would only be valid for music from Western culture, and I'm not a musical critic so would leave that line here.For a literary piece, I would be tempted to paraphrase Rachmaninoff and say there's no substitute for story. It may be only a small part of the whole and would definitely not make the book a work of art of itself, but it has to be there.If you think this review is hardly related to the book being reviewed, congratulations! - that is exactly the effect the book itself would have at many points."

By writing from multiple viewpoints, Patchett managed to make me sympathetic to nearly all the characters (even the ones I hated at first). She jumps around in the timeline of this family, from the 1960s to present day, but the book is so well constructed that this never felt confusing. Reading this book was like unwrapping layers of wrapping paper to get to the present inside: one family you will never forget. I'd especially recommend this as a book club pick for folks who enjoy character-driven novels. It would be really fun to discuss all the different characters and learn who everyone's favorites are and why. "

There were just too many characters and too many time switches for me. I ended up not caring about any of the characters. Every once in awhile I got caught up in a storyline but then it was gone too quickly. The beginning chapter was strong and I had high hopes. I love thinking about the integrity and ""ownership"" of family stories but there were too many stories told. Inside the chaos there was a great story that got thoroughly muddled.

The writing is fine, and while there's not much plot to speak of, Patchett makes up for the lack eventfulness with an intricate structure and a playfulness with time and chronology. There are too many characters in too confined a space for them all to come out well-developed, which gives the book an uneven feel, but COMMONWEALTH is a compelling novel nonetheless. "

It's ridiculously confusing. Which kid belongs to which parent? And which parent was with whom initially and then later? Marjorie, God bless her, was a place-holder, not a character. After a while, I was able to keep track of everyone better, but the book contains way too many characters, and the reason we (okay, I) can't remember them is because they're all so superficially drawn. After those first few chapters when the two families (meaning the kids) were thrown together during the summer, the chapters following are more or less vignettes about the kids after they've grown up. I don't know any of these people well enough to root for them or care what happens to them. The book is a classic example of telling, not showing."

263,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/865502-diane,Rating 5 out of 5,"I can vividly remember reading Ann Patchett's novel Bel Canto on my front porch one summer. I was mesmerized by her stunning story of a hostage situation in an unnamed South American country, and how I just fell into the book and didn't come out until the end.Her last novel, State of Wonder, about a research scientist who goes to the Amazon to search for her missing mentor, also brought me into a completely new world, one I wouldn't know that much about or even dream I would be interested in.Her newest novel is set closer to her own home. Commonwealth is the story of a blended family- a man with four young children leaves his wife and marries a woman with two children. (This happened to Patchett's family.) How that comes about, and the repercussions of the man kissing a woman who is not his wife at a neighborhood party, makes for a story that may be more relatable to most people.Albert is a district attorney in Southern California in the 1960's. He goes to a christening party for the daughter of Fix, a police officer he doesn't know well, and becomes enchanted with Fix's beautiful wife Bev. He kisses Bev and soon leaves his wife and children and takes Bev and her two daughters to Virginia to live.The opening scene of the party is brilliantly done. Fix the cop describes DA's as ""the guys who smoked your cigarettes because they were trying to quit."" Soon Albert is not only smoking Fix's cigarettes, he has stolen Fix's wife Bev.Years later, Fix tells his adult daughter Franny that Bev ""didn't have her own character. She turned into whoever she was sitting next to. When she was sitting next to Miss Free Love then free love sounded like a great idea.""The story spans five decades, and we see the children grow from six children thrown together in summers in Virginia to adults, all bearing the scars of a childhood that included a tragedy most of them never got over.Franny, the baby at the christening, grew up and met Leo Posen, a famous novelist who falls in love with her. She tells Leo her family's tale and he turns it into his comeback novel titled 'Commonwealth'. Franny is staying with Leo at the home of a wealthy actress in the Hamptons, and ends up acting as servant to the many people who decide to descend uninvited, including her younger stepbrother Albie, who comes to confront her about the book.There are many characters in this moving story, and Patchett excels at crystalizing each one in a few scenes. A book that covers five decades of a family could easily clock in at over 600 pages, but Patchett manages to create this world in just over 300 pages.Fix was my favorite character in the book, an honorable man who loves his children and even shows great kindness to Albert's first wife when she needed it. I also loved that Albert's first wife picked herself up and got a great job to support her family when her husband left her.Commonwealth is based on Patchett's family, and Franny is her doppleganger. Patchett has said in interviews about the book that she spoke to all of her siblings about the book, getting their blessing to tell the story. I'm not sure how many families would be OK with that. As I read the book I kept thinking, ""what would a book about your childhood look like?""I think perhaps she felt the time was right to write this intensely personal book, one so close to home. At one point Frannie and her sister Caroline are riding in the car with their ailing father and Frannie thinks of Fix:""All the stories go with you, Frannie thought, closing her eyes. All the things I didn't listen to, won't remember, never got right, wasn't around for.""I think that line sums up Patchett's place in her life, one that many middle-aged people are dealing with as well. You get to a certain point in life and you contemplate how you got to where you are, and how your family played such a big role in that.Commonwealth is not a story that you race through to finish. It's one to savor and ponder, and upon reflection I liked it much more a week or so after I finished it than when when I closed the book. I highly recommend it."
264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7743315-jeanne,Rating 5 out of 5,"The six children held in common one overarching principle that cast their potential dislike for one another down to the bottom of the minor leagues: they disliked the parents. They hated them (p. 84). And, rightly. During the summers, the siblings and stepsiblings were let to run wild and might as well have been raised by wolves. Their summer parents were overwhelmed by them, abandoning them to their own resources and decisions (often poor): the children found and carried their father's gun, repeatedly drugged a bothersome sibling, found and drank their parents' liquor, smacked and bullied each other for any sort of reason, and took off for the day without a clear sense of direction. One died, perhaps indirectly from this pattern of neglect. Why had their father fought to get summer custody? As near as I can tell, it was because he could, maybe to thumb his nose at his ex-.There are several things that endear me to a novel: when it spans a significant expanse of time, especially if that time is not laid out linearly. I like when it makes me work to see and understand the characters and their stories, their motivations no more clear to them than ours are to ourselves: ""It was hard to say what was bothering him most about her trip to Iowa, that a woman he would have liked quite a bit had there been time was going to a party in another state with another man, or that he wished he were going with her, or that he wished he were going instead of her"" (pp. 148-149).But stories change with time and distance. One story you might tell about the Cousin/Keating siblings is that they hated each other and their Virginia parents. Another, equally valid one: “We always stuck together. Don’t you remember that? We were such a fierce little tribe” (p. 298). Similarly, the siblings were both wolf pups and, somehow, survivors – by turns, compassionate, responsible, competent and high-achieving, even if arson, drugs, and tattoos had been their story at one point. The beauty of epics is that we are reminded that people grow and change, often in unpredictable directions.One story in this larger story is that of the great Leon Posen publishing the stories of their childhood, only lightly reworking them (e.g., a homemaker becoming a doctor). GR's blurb has this as the center of the book, but Posen's story – which we only glimpse – had to have been a photograph at best, perhaps a gifted photograph, but it couldn't allow the families to grow and change. Commonwealth made me think about the richness of our stories, about both possessing and repossessing our stories, about how we change and only know part of each other's stories. All the stories go with you, Franny thought, closing her eyes. All the things I didn’t listen to, won’t remember, never got right, wasn’t around for (pp. 265-266). The Posen story also made me think about how we can be owned. Without thinking about it, Posen took over Franny's life and took her for granted. But we can also take back control, rewrite our stories, recognize how our stories are always bigger than what others see, than what we may see.She had never told that story to Leo. She had meant to but then for some reason she decided to hold it back. Now she understood that at some point far out in the future there would be a night just like tonight, and she would remember this story and know that no one else in the world knew it had happened except Albie. She had needed to keep something for herself. (pp. 354-355)"

I think these are the two key ones.Commonwealth starts when a man tries to escape the drudgery of his wife and children by attending a christening party. Ironic. There he kisses the mother of the child being christened and triggers a chain of events that variously divides and unite two families.Many years later, the child who was being christened is working as a waitress in a cocktail bar when she meets an author she adores. They strike up a relationship that has far reaching effects for the two families concerned.This is a brilliantly constructed story. I know it’s not everyone’s idea of fun, but I am a great fan of books with a non-linear chronology. Commonwealth bounces around chapter by chapter and I found I had to spend the first couple of pages of each new chapter working out when it was set and what that meant for what had already happened and what was still to happen. But that’s not a complaint: I loved it!It’s the story of two families and it deals with love, loss and relationships. But more than that, the twists and turns in the story mean it becomes about who owns a person’s story. If you tell your lover about your family, for example, can he do whatever he wants with it? This is an especially relevant question when the lover concerned is an author in need of a plot for the book he needs to write. And then it is relevant again when the book is a runaway success and people want to make a film of it.One of the things I admired about this book was the way Patchett could tell us the story of the two families without letting one or two of the characters take over. There are a lot of characters in the book and the relationships between them can be hard to keep track of as people get married, divorced, married again (and again) and have children with different partners. But the main characters are all beautifully written without one taking the limelight from the others. It might be advisable to draw up a family tree of some kind while reading it: I know that would have helped me a few times.Comfortably 4.5 stars, but I am not sure I can go all the way to 5. I may re-visit that opinion in the next few days."
266,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126296-kristy,Rating 4 out of 5,"It seems like a fairly regular day in Southern California: the day of young Franny Keating's christening party. When her father, Fix, opens the door, he's surprised to see Albert Cousins there. Fix, a cop, doesn't associate much with the DAs on his beat, and he certainly didn't invite Bert. But Bert has shown up with a bottle of gin--looking to hide from his own wife and children--and he soon joins the party, making drinks with Fix's beautiful wife, Beverly. By the end of the evening, Bert and Beverly have kissed, triggering a chain of events that will alter the lives of all involved. This is an expansive book, covering the lives of the intertwined Cousins and Keating families in a series of almost interconnected stories. They are linked, of course, and form the framework of Packer's novel, but almost seem as if they could stand on their own. They are also set against the backdrop of another Commonwealth: when Franny, then in her twenties, meets famous author Leon Posen, she tells him the many stories of her misguided family. He spins them into the tale of his novel, Commonwealth, forcing the family to face up to some of their most awful losses and decisions in the starkness of print. Some of the chapters of COMMONWEALTH aren't always particularly exciting, but they are poignant, and there is a deepness to them. They offer an amazing insight into these families-- an almost ""behind the scenes"" look at five or so decades of their lives. The varying viewpoints of the narrators helps as well, and you can watch a Cousin or Keating child age in just a couple of chapters. It's also interesting to watch the spouses--so changed by the affair--and how it's affected their lives.Overall, this is a lovely book, tender in many ways, and a little heartbreaking. It's not a page-turner, but it's beautiful and leaves you thinking. I received a copy of this novel from the publisher and Edelweiss (thank you!); it is available everywhere on 9/13/2016. "

Commonwealth is one of the most empathetic and reflective book I’ve ever read. The writing is masterful, the characters are all so deeply felt, and the literary inserts are so powerful. The books tells a saga of two families, The Cousins and The Keatings, once entwined by the affair and sham marriage of Beverly Keating and Bert Cousin, put their six children unioned as stepsiblings. The children were brought to spend summers together, where they unwillingly bonded under the shared resentment towards their distressing situation and the parents who caused it. 
”Here was the most remarkable thing about the Keating children and the Cousins children: they did not hate one another, nor did they possess one shred of tribal loyalty. (...) The six children held in common one overarching principle that cast their potential dislike for one another down to the bottom of the minor leagues: they disliked the parents. They hated them.”
It was until the fateful tragedy where one of the kids died then the joint summer met an apparent end. We follow the trajectories of the children over the years, seeing how their connections and shared history followed them and affected their entire lives. The story on the other end is simple but contains a lot of themes that anyone can relate to. It is unnerving to see how far the turbulence of marriage can both direct and indirectly victimize the children raised up under this household. The way parents can hurt their children with abandonment, neglect and disinterest. The way parents can hurt their children by being only half there.Commonwealth in addition to being beautiful and harrowing also serves such a good job of leaving things unsaid but obvious. Got no words how much the characters’ emotional growth penetrates my entire existence. A total treasure indeed."
268,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2426275-columbusreads,Rating 4 out of 5,"There's an important moment in the middle of this book in which I thought the event or scene was just completely and totally implausible. That Patchett was asking her reader to just accept the notion that a confluence of events were not only possible but necessary. At that point in the story I was ready to just get through the book as quickly as possible and get on to something else. But her exquisite storytelling wouldn't allow me to do that. Her storytelling has a way of just reeling you in and 60 pages later you feel like you've read one long sentence and forgotten all sense of place and time.This enthralling saga of blended families dividing their time between Torrance, CA and VA is told in a nonlinear fashion that is on occasion so convoluted and patchy it becomes difficult to know where you are. I had to read the first two or three paragraphs to figure out who was talking to whom, where they were and what the situation was. Also, the story spanned a couple of generations with blended families with lots of kids and it really became a little confusing at times. Not to mention that both sets of parents married multiple times and you had kids associated with these new spouses that you had to get used to as well. In other words, you can pay really close attention to all that's happening with these family members and still get lost.All of that being said, the storytelling makes up for these flaws and after the last page you realize Patchett has delivered another winner. Not quite a home run but landing safely at third.3.5 stars"

Thus starting their affair, ending their two marriages and starting a new life together with their 6 children (Bert's 4 and Beverely's 2). That's the entire plot. (Nothing to write home about - but man, I was proved wrong).The book is about the consequences and changes in their life. The journey and experiences they all take to deal with the trauma and emotions in their life. How each one takes a different path and reconnects over the years. The book is written in a series of vignettes, in non chronological order, from different perspectives of the family. Now that seems a bit crazy, but Ann Patchett weaves things together masterfully. This book had a strong potential to be a chaotic mess. But Patchett makes it look easy. She has woven a masterpiece together. It reminds me of those gorgeous patch quilts that 10 years to make, but show the journey of life. Not just the beauty, but the messy, complicated brutality of it. Go out and read this novel if you're in the mood to read a story that is like a small stream, thick in the middle of a beautiful cool forest. You put your hand in and watch that crisp cool water flow by."

Her writing is deep and sensitive, with an ability to delve deeply into her characters' inner emotions and actions. Although she has certainly accomplished much of this in this book, I have been left feeling a sense of inconsistencies throughout. The story line of this book is about the dissolution of two marriages and the resulting consequences in the lives of the four adults and six children involved. The novel covers a period of fifty years . Each character's life and attitude is addressed periodically, but often I found that just as I was gaining interest with someone's involvement, the story would divert to another person. I often had to refresh my sense of recall with the many names of major and minor characters. The fact that so many were featured in this narrative made it a difficult achievement for the author to flesh out some of the interesting tales. I was sometimes left with questions and disappointment. It would be intriguing to view how Patchett could accomplish the telling of some of these individuals in their own books."
271,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46263774-adriana-delgado,Rating 4 out of 5,"Commonwealth is another example of Anne Patchett's incredible talent for storytelling. A story that begins to unravel when Bert Cousins and Beverly Keating share a heated kiss at Beverly's baby daughter's Christening party. This sets forth the joining of each other's lives and their respective children into a new albeit sometimes dysfunctional family. Although Beverly and Bert are not the best people and predictably hurt others with their initial affair and consequential marriage, leaving their spouses and their children in a state of confusion, anger and disappointment after they run off together to Virginia, Patchett leaves no doubt that these two deserve each other, if only for their selfish drive to act on their own desires. What Beverly and Bert seem to have not anticipated in their conviction that their liaison was ""meant to be"", is that managing six children, half of which aren't your own, is no easy feat. After a particularly trying day with the whole infantile menagerie, Beverly feels trapped with nowhere to go:“She thought about the fact that if she were in the garage rather than the carport she’d be killing herself now.” This feeling of entrapment will be the beginning of a slippery slope which includes a family tragedy and a painful revelation of secrets.Beautifully written, Commonwealth is addictive and tumultuous reading at its best."
272,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18904761-susi-lopera,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 stars: The book was right for me. Patchett dwells on little details and creates vivid characters, and as a reader idiosyncratic details and characters are my kind of wonderful. The characters are complicated and engaging, though I think Patchett focused on too many characters so I didn't feel like I truly knew any of the characters. An issue with the book (to me it's not an issue) is that the book didn't have much of a plot. Certain books need a clear cut plot to drive them forward, but the meandering expansive snapshots of places, times and situations in this book, to me, were engaging and a pleasure to read. Many of the events felt only vaguely connected to each other and in certain scenes nothing much happened, but every scene felt necessary to the book, nothing felt superfluous. However, I'm the kind of reader who likes to get lost in the little details and who likes a carefully and patiently constructed story, even if nothing much happens in the story. But I'm sure many readers were bored. The story is plodding and never comes to a climax and the scenes feel like snapshots, like little short stories that were only vaguely connected. So you might like the book if you're a sucker for expansive meandering snapshots like me, or maybe you'll find it boring and unsatisfactory."
273,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62695678-ashley,Rating 2 out of 5,"I hated this book so much! I haven’t hated a book this much in a while.I listened to it on audiobook and it was exactly 11 hours too long. Let me try to breakdown what I didn’t like.First of all, the writing style is not my cup of tea. It seemed like it was all over the place. Also, I didn’t care about these characters AT ALL as I didn’t get to know them. I had zero, zip, zilch, nada, not a modicum of emotion or care about them. Another thing – this is my first Ann Patchett novel so I’m not sure how many diverse characters she has in her books. All the people of color in this book were supporting characters (which is fine) but the way she wrote them was awful. A couple examples - the boys that one of the main characters hung around were El Salvadoran and Black. So of course they were known as the “bad boys” who were into drugs, stealing and causing trouble. The African character was called “the friendliest of creatures”. Creatures. Most readers may not think much of this but I’m always sensitive to the way in which certain authors write black characters. The things I liked: That it ended. I usually try not to write off an author based on one book but she just may not be for me and that’s okay."
274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39941384-barbara-anderson,Rating 3 out of 5,One of my all time favourite books is Ann Patchett's 'Bel Canto' and every book I have read of hers since then has failed to live up to the pleasure that book gave me. This one is a curious thing - a pastiche almost of 'scenes' from the present and later lives of a family split by divorce. Some of these scenes or vignettes work beautifully and are really absorbing and almost stand-alone as short stories. And some are meandering and tedious and pad out the book until you reach another perfectly realised scene or revelation of a particular segment of one of the character's lives. So ... as a book it didn't hang together coherently for me; the sum of its parts didn't make up the whole. But to be dipped into at selected acutely observed moments it's a joy - it's just the 'finding' of those moments requires patience ....

There are many protagonists but none too similar to have to double check. The author leaves a trail of bread crumbs to link the chapters and the story together. Do not put the book down for too long or you will miss some of the more delightful bread crumbs. The book covers decades and the cast of characters is basically introduced in the first chapter; some concretely, others abstractly but by the end the reader knows every one of them. Completely enjoyable book. In part, because of the clever way it is told."

I can't remember another time I've seen a floating POV used so masterfully - with ten major/semi-major characters, no less! Each time Patchett's eye would move from one sibling to the next, I'd want her to stop, to stay, to give me more of that particular person - but then she somehow made me feel that way about each character she lighted on, making me care about people I didn't think I would care about, and showing me, once again, why fiction matters.

Wounds heal slowly when children are shuttled between parents and are left in the dark about life changes. When tragedy strikes, does it strengthen the bonds in a family or does it tear it asunder? Who can live with the guilt? This book carries a strong message about forgiveness, responsibility, and not taking loved ones for granted. "

292,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/118424378-aaron,Rating 3 out of 5,"There are trends in every genre of everything. Trends aren't always bad but they can get grating at a certain point. My feelings on Commonwealth--which, shamefully, did not win the Orange Prize--are complicated by trends in modern fiction. Commonwealth is a modern family saga. It follows two families (it often feels like 15 families) over several decades after a chance encounter at a party leads to an unexpected romantic entanglement. We're then privy to the goings on amongst the children of the two families and their parents. Think of a slightly more sordid Brady Bunch. Spoilers begin here. The novel starts at a Christening party for Franny, the youngest of the Keating family. Bert Cousins decides to randomly show up. Seriously, he just shows up, he doesn't even know anybody at the party. But he hates being around his family so much (you know how it goes) that he will take any excuse he can get to get away from them, including going to a random person's child's Christening party. (Which, like, who doesn't love a good Christening, right???) At the party, everyone gets wildly drunk, and Bert finds himself enchanted by the wildly attractive Beverly Keating. She's the type that is literally so attractive, you'll ruin your life for them. Crash your car, leave your wife, ruin someone else's family, even make out with while she's holding a baby while you're at a Christening party you weren't invited to (sarcasm very much intended if that wasn't clear). Which Bert does. Not crash his car, makes out with her while she's holding Franny at a Christening party two which, he wasn't invited. This make out sets up the rest of the novel. It leads to Beverly leaving her husband, Fix Keating (yes, his name is Fix) to marry Burt. We almost immediately find out that they can't make it last (shocker, I know) and end up divorced and remarried what seems like several more times. The main action of the novel comes from the blending of the two families, the Keatings and the Cousins. Pay attention here: there are FOUR Cousins children (Cal, Jeanette, Holly, and Albie) and TWO Keating children (Caroline and Franny). If you have read this novel, you probably got the feeling that there were approximately FIFTEEN children and that they randomly switch from family to family. Well, if you're like me you did. I found it extremely confusing to keep track of the respective broods and had to remind myself like I was studying for a test who was who throughout the book. Anyway, even though the book seemingly wants us to believe that the two groups of children don't get along, they seem to get along mostly just fine, with one notable exception, which I will get to. They play together, they talk together, they steal their father's gin and gun out of his glove compartment together, you know, kid stuff. So, you can see already that this is a modern family novel. I put that in italics because it feels like this is a modern fiction archetype in the great tradition of books like Franzen's The Corrections, Zadie Smith's White Teeth and On Beauty, basically Marilynn Robinson's whole bibliography, and even to some extent David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest(though IJ is wayyy more than a family novel). Now, being a modern family novel does not make it a bad novel. I really liked/loved all of the books i just mentioned (though with Franzen's subsequent output I'm not sure I wouldn't throw The Corrections through a window if I reread itnow--on my to-do list). But there are some similarities among all of them: blended families, nontraditional setups, conflict among family members, complicated parents who are usually terrible, complicated love lives and careers, and a great family secret that sets up most of the tension throughout the book. Commonwealth has so many features in common with other modern family novels it's ridiculous: The character who is so unbelievably attractive that everyone wants to die in their presence (Infinite Jest, On Beauty); blended, complicated families (IJ, White Teeth, pretty much every Franzen Novel); central mystery (all of the above); complicated, horrible families (again, all of the above). It could really be considered the archetypical modern family novel except it isn't up to the same quality as the other books on the listCommonwealth fits this pattern to a tee. Therein my complicated feelings are born. I feel like I've read all this crap before. Every one of the children is damaged in their own way and mostly have the most ridiculous lives in the world. One child becomes a lawyer, the only normal one. Another one has an affair with her favorite novelist whom she randomly meets in a bar who then writes out her family's story and wins lots of awards (you know, as one does) and names it (do you want three guesses?)--Commonwealth. Another sibling is a ne'er do well who, like, supposedly is the only child who got Native American ancestry or something, even though he has three siblings? (I have to have misunderstood this, right?) He lights fires, can't find a job, all the other family members are vaguely scared of him, etc. Another one moves to a remote Zen Buddhist monastery (an elite one, in case you were wondering) and whiles away her days breathing and quietly gardening. I think one other sibling might be normal and just marries someone. Oh, and one of them is dead, which is the dark family secret. Outside of the ridiculousness of the children's collective lives, the dark family secret was the peak of ridiculousness for this book. I'm hiding the review due to spoilers, but--another warning--huge spoilers follow. The eldest sibling in the family, Cal, ends up dead because he is stung by a bee and he is allergic. It happens. I myself am allergic to bees and have managed to avoid this fate so far. However, the circumstances leading up to why he dies of this bee sting were too absurd for me to handle. All the Cousins/Keating kids love to go out on adventures together to lakes and whatnot. This is where they bring the aforementioned father's gin and gun. Well, Albie, the youngest sibling, is so unbelievably annoying, that they, get this, CONSTANTLY DRUG HIM WITH GIN AND BENADRYL SO THAT HE WILL PASS OUT IN A FIELD AND THEY CAN ALL GO PLAY TOGETHER WITHOUT HAVING TO BE ANNOYED BY HIM AND THEN THEY GO BACK LATER AND GET HIM AND TELL HIM HE JUST FELL ASLEEP. You know, as one does. I mean, who is writing this? This is supposedly autobiographical to some extent: did Ann Patchett drug her annoying youngest step-sibling? Is this a normal thing? Isn't this book supposed to be somewhat realistic given that it's literary fiction? Anyway, the day that Cal dies, he doesn't have enough Benadryl to take when he is stung by a bee because he used it all drugging his brother because he is so unbelievably annoying. So, he dies, traumatizing everyone. I found this far too ridiculous to stomach. This was what the whole book was hinting at and I laughed out loud and raged at once when it was finally all revealed. It was one of the dumbest family reveal secrets I've ever read. Now, I've been pretty harsh on Commonwealth so far. However, it was plenty enjoyable, if ridiculous and a bit contrived. I was interested in where the plotlines were going. I didn't exactly like the characters or find their struggled particularly compelling, but I did want to find out where they ended up. I realized as I was writing this review, that Commonwealth is basically the This is Us of novels (itself the quintessential modern family tv drama). I liked watching This is Us a lot too despite being hyper-unrealistic, unrelatable, and melodramatic. Since Commonwealth was a quick read, it didn't cost me much to go along for the ride with these absurd characters. Patchett's writing is decent (not nearly as good as her other novel I've read--and loved--Dutch House) and she does tell a funny joke here and there (though I will say the bad jokes far outnumber the good ones). My overall point is this: Commonwealth is fine. I enjoyed reading it. But it is unrelatable, extremely unrealistic, quite stupid in places, and the writing is not good enough to make up for all of that. It is a fun read and won't cost you much time. "

I really liked it!The first chapter of this book is just marvelous - it really pulls you in. I can also say that chapter 3 made me laugh in so many places!The premise of this book is a blended family and their trials and tribulations. There are six children involved in the mess that their parents have made, and we get a taste of what has happened to all of them and also stories of their past. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is because it ended somewhat abruptly. Although, I love when a book has a point, and to me, the point of Commonwealth is that even if you believe you have shared everything with those around you, there are some things that you have kept for yourself.I can recommend this book."
294,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"It’s hard to describe why I enjoyed this book so much. The plot is interesting but not overly compelling. The content is not unusual or perspective shifting. But it is so well written that I was engaged in every scene as we shift through time and place across two generations of two families. I loved reading about a house party in California, then the Palmer House hotel bar in Chicago, and a beach in Virginia, and a small apartment in Brooklyn and a yoga retreat in the alps. The characters’ inner monologues reveal people who are imperfect but usually honest with themselves. There aren’t really answers but lots of glimpses on what it looks like to try to be a good parent and sibling even when things have gone wrong. There is the often revisited meditation that really never gets old for me on how one decision or chance circumstance can alter the rest of our lives. Finally, the book asks: what stories do we tell about our lives, what do we keep for ourselves, and how does that change the experience of those memories? I’m excited to read more Anne Patchett. "

Yet, one must not dwell on the objective truth of the novel. In an interview published in Parnassus Musing, her own bookstore’s magazine, Ann Patchett says: “None of it happened and all of it’s true.” I finished the book in 2 sittings. How do you write a family saga without being overwhelmed by the large number of characters and many decades of their lives? Commonwealth is like a necklace of time capsules of various sizes and importance, each capsule a snapshot of what happened in a particular time and space, and all capsules are dynamically linked. There are meticulous details and broad brushstrokes. Time flows smoothly back and forth, but generally forth, like winding stairs, although the destination is never any kind of heaven.None of the characters are perfect. The children turned out to be mostly ok, despite their childhood troubles. I find the main theme, children’s disillusionment of their parents, very moving.

Jag känner att jag kommer att sakna de här människorna och att få höra om detaljerna i deras liv. Det är just i beskrivningen av detaljer och situationer som Patchett lyser, det blir lite som att läsa en novellsamling där alla berättelserna visar sig höra ihop väldigt mycket.

Anyway, it was entertaining to me to read about this blended family and all the dramatic things that happen from when they are little kids up to middle age or so. I have to admit that I didn't really enjoy the first chapter and didn't know if I would like the book. Then, it was a bit of a struggle for one or 2 chapters to remember who was who and who belonged to what family, but then something clicked with me and book. At that point, I was immersed in it. I kind of wished it would go on for another hundred pages or so, but I was satisfied with how it ended. It was a book about families and choices we make and how those choices affect each other and just how life is sometimes messy. "

307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2913233-patty-shlonsky,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett hits the trifecta with ""Commonwealth""--great writing, great story telling and great insight--all told in a matter of fact style with a touch of humor.  ""Commonwealth"" is about family--which means it's about love and hate, betrayal and forgiveness, expectations and disappointment, life and death. The story begins when deputy District Attorney Albert (Bert) Cousins crashes Franny Keating's christening party, meets and immediately falls in love with Franny's extraordinarily beautiful mother Beverly and two separate families suddenly become intwined. Bert leaves his pregnant wife Teresa and their three children and Beverly leaves her police officer husband Fix. Beverly and Bert marry and along with Beverly's two daughters, Caroline and Franny, they move from Los Angeles to Virginia. Teresa is left with four children to raise on her own in Los Angeles, although Bert does suggest that she move with them to Virginia. ""That was all it took for Teresa Cousins to spend the rest of her life in Los Angeles."" The Cousins children (Cal, Holly, Jennette and Albie) come to Virginia every year and the six children together wreak the kind of havoc that only six children very close in age with very little parental oversight can create. ""The six children held in common one overarching principle that cast their potential dislike for one another down to the bottom of the minor leagues: they disliked the parents. They hated them."" When a tragedy strikes, the summers together come to an end, although a few years later, after setting fire to the art room at his school, Albie is sent to live in Virginia. The story is told in alternating chronology. We learn about the family pasts and their presents, and their changing relationships, mostly, although not exclusively, through Franny's life story. Fix encourages his daughters to go to law school and Caroline becomes a successful lawyer while Franny drops out of law school and, struggling to find her place, works as a cocktail waitress at the Palmer House in Chicago. ""For someone who had no skills and no idea what she wanted to do with her life other than read, cocktail waitressing was the most money she could make while keeping her clothes on. Those were her only two criteria at this point: not to be a lawyer and to keep her clothes on."" While working as a cocktail waitress, she meets legendary author Leon Posen and they begin a life together (despite the fact that he is more than 30 years older than Franny and married to someone else). Franny shares her life story with Posen, who turns it into a National Book Award winning novel and ultimately a movie. Of course the story is modified and interpreted from Posen's perspective, causing the family to react with horror, shock and offense, mixed with what appears to be indifference . ""A film of life would definitely be better than this, even if there had been a camera behind them every minute recording the entire disaster of childhood, all the worst memories preserved, it would still have been better than having to watch these strangers making some half-assed attempt to replicate their lives."" The story makes you stop and wonder what your life might look like from a detached observer's perspective. Beverly ultimately divorces Bert and remarries, adding another family to the mix. People age, get married, have children, suffer regret, become ill and die. The characters look back on their lives with a mixture of regret, detachment and resignation. ""All the stories go with you, Franny thought, closing her eyes. All the things I didn't listen to, won't remember, never got right, wasn't around for."" And Teresa, many years after her divorce from Bert muses that ""The things you really need are never there when you need them."" The book addresses the thought provoking questions of how the randomness of events influence a life and how to ensure that the experiences of the past become part of the future without losing your own story in the process. I laughed through the first half of the book and cried through the second. Ann Patchett tells a great story but reminds you that life is as it is and not as you would wish it could be. The book is due to be published in September and I will be buying my own copy. If you like this review subscribe to www.frombriefstobooks.com"

The reader is really in master hands here – the writing feels effortless, and the characters are so real I half expect to run into them on the street. They reminded me of some of the characters in the TV series Mad Men, not so much because they're all relatively affluent suburban white people, but mostly because they are handled with sensitive understatement, and we get to watch them change and grow (or not) over time. Mad Men had several years and many episodes to do this, but it amazes me that Commonwealth does it in a mere 322 pages – which felt more like 200 pages to me, Patchett’s writing is that economical. I especially like the way she wrote about the children when they were young kids, and the story of their illicit trip to the lake was priceless. If I were to quibble, I’d say that more time could have been spent with Albie and Jeanette, and I would have liked to peer a little closer into Beverly’s head, but then that might have destroyed the economy I loved so much."

When Franny becomes Leon's muse and tells him her family's story, little does she realise that she has then relinquished control over the story of her family.....This was an excellent family saga, capturing the changing relationships between parents, siblings and step-siblings, as the story loops back and forth through time and the characters traverse from childhood into adulthood and, in some cases, parenthood - and cope with all the tragedies that families often face throughout their lives. A good read although I must admit that I prefer Elizabeth Strout's writing to this one - 8/10."
310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22548315-z-f,Rating 3 out of 5,"""For Bert the past was always right there with him, and so he assumed that everyone else felt the same way."" -ch. 9, pg. 318I picked this one up mostly because the cover is pretty and I tend to enjoy sprawling stories about dysfunctional families. I was sufficiently drawn in by the first chapter, an extended party scene with a shifting POV that owes a clear debt to Virginia Woolf (""Fix said he would buy the ice himself""), but my enthusiasm petered out pretty quickly after that.It's not that there's anything glaringly wrong with Commonwealth. It's not a bad book. It's just sort of... lifeless. Here's a fairly typical passage, which I think illustrates my point better than an explanation would:""Albie stared up at the house. It was not the one he'd come to as a child. It wasn't any house he'd ever seen before. At some point between the last time he was in Virginia and now, Bert and Beverly had moved and failed to mention that fact to Holly or Albie or Jeanette. And why should they, when no one thought that Holly or Albie or Jeanette would ever visit again? But his father hadn't mentioned the new house at the airport either. Did he forget? Did he think Albie wouldn't notice? This place was bloodred brick with fluted white columns in the front, a junior relation of the house his grandparents lived in outside Charlottesville. It was heavily landscaped with plants and trees he didn't recognize, everything orderly and neat. He could see the edge of a swimming pool already covered in tarp for the winter. He could look in the window from the patio and see the kitchen, see the fancy copper pots that hung from a rack on the ceiling, but if he got up and opened the door and walked through the kitchen, he wouldn't know which way he was supposed to turn. He wouldn't know which bedroom he was supposed to sleep in."" (ch. 6, pgs. 218-19)Do you see what I mean? It's fine, it gets us from point A to point B, but it doesn't set a mood or evoke an emotion or tell us anything interesting about the character. And that’s the tone of the whole book. No matter what's going on or which of the many characters we're following at a given time, it’s presented in the same disinterested, dispassionate way. There's a sense of detachment from the action and the characters, and before long all the people and plot details start to run together. This is especially noticeable when there's a shift in time: though the book spans fifty or more years, I was rarely certain of what decade I was in at a given time. That opening party scene, for instance, takes place in the (early?) 1960s; I read the whole 30-page chapter thinking it was supposed to be the present day.Then there's the issue of the characters themselves. The cast is a large one (two families, joined by an affair that leads to two divorces that lead to any number of remarriages, with six kids between them and several significant others to account for), and there simply isn't enough space in these 322 pages to flesh everyone out in a satisfying way. I don't usually have trouble keeping track of characters, even when there are a lot of them, but for most of this reading I couldn't have told you which kids belonged to what parents or matched most of their names to a personality. Patchett tries to counter this by giving us a lot of backstory in summary format, but that only adds to the impersonal effect and pulls the reader further out of the narrative. For most of the book I didn't feel any real attachment to any of these people, and as a result I didn’t care much what happened to them either.With all that being said, I don't want to dump on Ann Patchett. From a technical standpoint her writing is quite good, if not particularly exciting, and the central concept could be interesting if handled differently. She’s skilled at crafting scenes where there are lots of players to account for (which any writer can tell you is no easy task), and there were a handful of individual moments I found touching or even powerful. All the same, this one was hard to push through, and I'm glad to be done and on to new things."

It's my favorite work at Patchett's as well, because the book feels so real. Everyone has a story, and I find again and again my favorite movies and books are stories about people's lives. There doesn't need to be magic, or special effects, or time travel (though I love all that too.) Perhaps this book draws on inspiration from Patchett's upbringing--I have read articles that point out the similarities between some plot points of the book and her own life. I went to a reading and interview with Ann Patchett and this topic wasn't discussed, but that doesn't matter to me. This is a compelling story, one I couldn't put down. What happens to the children of two families affected by divorce and uninterested parents? How does one event ripple throughout the years and generations. One of my favorite passages near the end of the book brought it all together for me:Lying in the darkness of her mother's house, Franny tried to imagine a world in which Sapna had lived. Maybe Franny and Kumar would have met again, bumped into each other in a bookstore one day, laughed and said hello and gone on, but she never would have married him, and his sons would never have been her sons. If Sapna could have lived than certainly Beverly could have stayed married to Fix, which would mean no Jack Dine, no Dine stepbrothers, no Christmas party in Virginia. It would also mean no Marjorie though, and that would be a terrible loss when Marjorie had given Fix the benefit of great love. But maybe Bert would have stayed with Teresa then, and fifty years later he might have saved her life by insisting she go to the doctor in time. Cal would have missed the bee that was waiting for him in the tall grass near the barn at Bert's parents' house. He could have lived for years, though who's to say another bee wouldn't have found him somewhere else? With Cal alive, Albie would never have set the fire that brought him to Virginia, thought he wouldn't have come to Virginia anyway because Bert would have stayed in California. Franny, half asleep on top of the bedspread beside her husband, was unable to map out all the ways the future would unravel without the moorings of the past. p. 310It's human nature to wonder how your life would be different if certain events, both in and out of your control, had not happened. Yet most of the time, how can we wish away even painful things that have ultimately brought love and other people into our lives? How can we imagine life without them?Thank you, Ann Patchett, for a beautiful novel that has given me many things to ponder as 2016 draws to a close."

Albert (Bert) Cousins, a Deputy District Attorney, show up unexpectedly and uninvited at Francis ""Fix"" Keating's house for his daughter Franny's christening party. He helps prepare drinks for the guests (there's a lot of orange squeezing involved). Fix does not know who he is until they begin to talk. It seems like everyone has orange trees in their yard. While looking for Franny, Bert finds her with her mother, Beverly. Bert and Beverly are instantly drawn to each other and kiss. Thus, this unexpected romantic encounter would change their families' lives forever.Bert divorced his wife Teresa. They have four children, Cal, Holly, Jeanette, and Albie. Fix and Beverly, who also divorced because of this affair, have two daughters, Caroline and Franny. While the kids from both families were rather indifferent to each other, they form an interesting and lasting bond. They merely tolerate each other. At times it seems like they are in a conspiracy to make their parents who cheated, exhausted and miserable. Bert and Beverly moved to the Commonwealth of Virginia. The kids spent summers there. One heartbreaking moment occurred when Cal died as a teen. How he died was controversial. At one point, Albie said that Ned from the barn shot Cal. But later, it turned out that Cal, who was allergic to bees, died from a bee sting.As the story progresses and everyone is grown, much of the focus turns to Franny, who is working as a waitress at The Palmer House Restaurant. Here Franny meets and falls in love with Leo Posen, a famous author, and has an affair with him. Leo is still married because his wife, who lives in California, would not sign the divorce papers. She was holding out to get a portion of his future book royalties. Leo wrote the book ""Commonwealth"" which is based on the life of the Keating and Cousin families. Later, the book was turned into a movie. Leo eventually dies, leaving the movie rights to Franny.Fix is dying from cancer. Teresa, who was also sick, passed away. Albie misses his mother terribly. With the Keating's mother and the Cousins' father, what began as a heartbreaking, sordid relationship formed some unlikely ties that brings the family closer. This is a good read."

316,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41583-rebecca,Rating 5 out of 5,"My second Ann Patchett book (after Patron Saint of Liars), and probably not my last. With a large cast of characters, many jumps in time, and two main locations, this book was both challenging and somehow easy. It flowed in a way that felt true to life, with long, detailed scenes and not many ""writerly"" manipulations like breaks and cliffhangers. I felt like I lived with the characters, and I'm still thinking about them. The length of time made all the characters seem human and relatable, even those with terrible flaws and who made terrible choices. This will be an interesting book club discussion.Incidentally, I really love the cover of this book: simple, graphic, memorable, ties to one of the key scenes literally, and metaphorically could represent a lot (family trees, the number 3, apple/orange falling far from the tree, etc etc). I half expect the paperback to come out with the typical fuzzy photo of a woman in a summer dress from the back, which wouldn't be fair to this book at all. Favorite quotes:“Bad habits were all a matter of perspective, and as long as the present was viewed through the lens of the past, anyone would say he was doing a spectacular job.”“All the stories go with you, Franny thought, closing her eyes. All the things I didn’t listen to, won’t remember, never got right, wasn’t around for.” “She believed that most of the human population didn’t avail themselves to their full psychic potential. They lived in a state of mental clutter, the bombardment of goods and services, information and striving. They wouldn’t be able to recognize true happiness if it were standing on their foot.” “This was the pleasure of a long life: the way some things worked themselves out. Caroline and her mother had become very close.”"

Commonwealth (Audio) by Ann Patchettreader: Hope Davispublished: 2016format: Overdrive digital audio, 10:34acquired: Libraryread: May 17-26rating: 4I like Ann Patchett and her clean prose that seems to always read well. [Commonwealth] is a book that accumulates attachment, and that has a lot of parts, and some parts work exceptionally well, and others don't work...or didn't for me. Initially I wasn't all that interested, but it was on audio and I didn't really mind it. Then I was loosely attached and then I was very much involved in all these characters and felt pretty good about the whole upon finishing. A plot summary won't do it justice. There are many kids from two marriages thrown together by parental affairs, divorces and second marriages. And they grow up each in their own way. They are children in the 70's and there is a lot of now, and a lot in between. And if there is a main point, I couldn't place my finger on it. I think the story is very personal and has echoes that go back into Patchett's own life, and her own parents divorce and east-west coast split. And, notably, having a police officer as a father. In her essay collection [This is the Story of a Happy Marriage] she has an essay about where she meets her father in California and goes through officer training as preparation for a book. I thought she had said in the essay she decided not to write the book (I don't know when the essay was written, but TSoaHM is from 2013.) This, it seems, is that book. note: The reader, Hope Davis, was excellent."

The Dutch House
 (2019), a Pulitzer-nominated novel that I thought was fine and that has already mostly faded from memory, and 
Bel Canto
 (2001), which won the Orange Prize (among others) and which I found too schmaltzy too take seriously. Then I worried I was misremembering Commonwealth. Maybe it wasn't THAT good.Long story short: I reread it, and IT IS THAT GOOD. As I said last time around, the first chapter is stunning (and I love how gin shows up again and again when these characters find their way back to each other), but the novel's construction -- how it sprints forward and then meanders backwards and folds in on itself -- is brilliant. The throughline is Franny: as an infant held between her mother and Bert Cousins; as the underappreciated muse, releasing lobsters into the sea; as the grown daughter, taking her father to chemotherapy and sharing a barmaid's gin & tonic with her step-father five decades after he first kissed her bombshell mother at her own christening party.Complicated and gorgeous and so true-to-life, this novel is a gift. July 2018: This is one of the best piece of fiction I've read in a long time. Each chapter could stand alone as its own short story.

I cannot seem to break free of the dysfunctional privileged white family sagas, and this certainly falls within those parameters. Happily, Patchett does more interesting things within that construct than her contemporaries dare. The multigenerational saga of two blended families, ""Commonwealth"" at times plays like ""The Brady Bunch"" as reimagined by Ann Tyler, a familiar situation loaded with meaning and punctuated by tragedies both real and oblique. Lots of characters here, and at times, you'll need a scorecard to keep track of them, which seems to be part of the larger point here. It's not about the individuals and their various assignations, but about the ever-shifting tides of family. Patchett's a luminous writer. When the narrative threatens to slip into the overly familiar, she shifts in time, space and character perspective to often powerful effect. She is playing with the very idea of the privileged white family narrative that has so dominated American fiction for the past several years, with a meta narrative critique that effectively skewers the format, and in some ways, the central premise of this novel. To say more would be to reveal too much. She's getting to the very core of how we frame family histories; how we use those stories to define and obscure our own identities, to trap and absolve ourselves and our loved ones."

I enjoy both her fiction and her non-fiction, and believe that I would probably love her company too. Her characters are always well-drawn. I was delighted to find out that she had another book coming out.Commonwealth is not a book to read if you're looking for linear plot. It is more of a portrait of a big, complicated blended family, their dramas and their secrets. A kiss that happens at a baptism among the child's mother and an uninvited guest is the spark that sets the entire story into action. Families reshuffle, and the six step-siblings spend every summer together, getting into trouble and running wild in Virginia until something bad happens.We follow each of these characters through adulthood, though the story focuses mostly on Franny - a law school dropout, who finds herself getting to know a famous writer. A lot happens here, but again, it's not really linear.I without a doubt, recommend this book. I loved the characters, with all their flaws and loyalties.

Providing different perspectives with an ever jumping timeline over 60 years, Commonwealth is a story about love, family, and responsibility that will enrapture you.What I liked: Even though this story doesn't have a classic story arch and resolution, I was totally captured by it. Pratchett's prose easily transports you between characters and settings, making it easy to follow the jumping timeline. I felt that every family member thought that he/she had it worse and the others easy until I as a reader was shown the flaws and challenges of the next character and how everyone's life changed after this seemingly innocent kiss. This book wasn't even on my radar until someone on bookstagram recommended it and I borrowed it on a whim from my library. What I didn't like: The only criticism is the introduction of a lot of characters in the first chapter at the Christening party. I was so confused and almost gave up on this book right there.

That first chapter, recounting a christening party that goes a little wild, is worth the price of admission alone: deftly skipping between points of view, introducing frankly a wider cast of characters than we actually get through the rest of the novel (what about Father Joe Mike?! About Beverly's sister?! Give me the novel-length version of that first chapter, about just that party, and I'll never read anything else), and pulsing with heat. I particularly loved the semi-meta nature of the title as well, functioning later on as a fictionalization of this fictional family's trauma, and the ways that Patchett interrogates writing-as-invasion-of-privacy. All in all, this felt pretty fucking perfect (although I would've probably cut the Switzerland section towards the end, which felt more like the author wanted to wrap up a thread she liked than it being a thread the reader needed wrapped).

I really, really liked it in the way I have previously loved Elizabeth Hay, Rachel Cusk, Carol Shields and others like them. While the audio version was very well done, I do feel I missed out on its depth, and I'm now determined to get my hands on a paper copy and read it all again in that dimension. There's a lot here, beautifully constructed, and I don't want to miss out; there is just something about a hard copy grasped tightly in one's hand, eyes skimming across the letters that makes the experience that much more intimate, and this book, I believe, deserves that."

It is a family drama (and there is a lot of drama) that is also funny and charming and filled with little moments that highlight the special love that exists in most extended family units. Sure, sometimes it's love/hate, but it's still love and it is bone deep. Patchett turns a laser focus on selected events which occur in the nearly 50 year span covered by the book, events which highlight larger themes and create a narrative. I glanced at some reviews that noted difficulty with the long stretches of time between events. That is so weird to me. These leaps, the focus on defining events, is the beauty of the book. This is not the story of things which happen to the family, the family itself is what happens. One note, I have liked and even loved Ann Patchett books before, but I nearly always dislike her endings which always seem abrupt and discordant and reek of palpable desperation to tie things up. I loved the ending of this book with all of its unresolved issues. Just like real life."

While there is not much of a plot, the story is full of engaging real life snippets that make it such a joy to read.As many other reviewers have already pointed out, one of the problems with this novel is Patchett's huge cast. You WILL need to make a family tree to keep all the characters straight! The six children aside, there are also the four divorced parents, the spouses that the children ultimately marry, the in-laws, the lovers, and a wide range of extras and bit players.Ultimately, the novel is more about a collected family history as seen through various lenses, rather than one particular story. I would recommend this book to Patchett fans, book clubs, and to anyone else who enjoys family dramas."

I am always enchanted by the way Ann Patchett sets up her novels—the first fifty pages or so feel miraculous, the setting perfectly tangible—but she always loses me somewhat by the end. They always seem to float in the most elegant way from scene to scene, across days and years and decades, but I find this tends to become tiresome as I crave more time and space devoted to specific threads, characters, or themes. At the same time, this book's quiet focus on the assumptions made by men about a woman's role floored me. The scene where Franny is made to cook and play hostess night and night for her older lover and his writing crowd made my blood boil, and the moment she throws the lobsters off the edge of the pier is so deeply satisfying. I also loved the thread about how stories become transformed until the fragments no longer resemble the real, lived origin and those in them no longer recognize themselves, how a specific telling can remove the nuances and edges of a person or a family."

It hasn't been going so hot. Maybe I've gotten too indoctrinated by elves, time travel, and ice planet barbarians but this genre is so boring to me? I guess for me I read to learn something new or for escape, so books like this about the minutiae of a broken-up family just don't really capture my interest. And it's not to say I don't find those themes have value; genre fiction obviously works best when it has characters grounded with 'real world' issues. I just prefer it when some fight scenes are sprinkled in too 😂. Looking back though, the ones I've tried are very white and also mainly deal with family issues, so maybe the fact that I don't really relate to the family dynamics contributes to my lack of interest? I think when I try this genre again I'll look for a non-white author or a non-Western setting. Rant over lmao and if ya'll got any suggestions drop em below please!"

The story of intertwined families over decades contains too many characters, abrupt time shifts, and unnecessary repetition. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable. Many of the situations seemed improbable. And just when I thought I was making sense of a vignette, the story would shift and contradict my assumptions. I had pretty much given up on Commonwealth about two-thirds in, but when I saw it (yet again!) at the top of the best-seller list, I made myself finish it. The few page-turning moments I uncovered weren't enough for Commonwealth to redeem itself.To say I find Ann Patchett incredibly talented is an understatement. Evidence of her talent appears in all-too-rare flashes of brilliance in Commonwealth. Instead of delighting me, however, they just made me ache at the thought of lost potential. "
