0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1790086-alisha,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book hits a lot of things that are at the core of healthy relationships. It spends the first portion delving into what your own needs/boundaries/likes/dislikes are, and the next portion getting into the dynamics of friendship. I thought it had a number of good suggestions, although the tone was a bit more casual than I was expecting, and there was quite a bit of language, which will be a turn-off for some readers (me included).Not all parts of the book will be relatable for everyone, but every reader will probably find some points that resonate. I thought one of the most practical sections was on what to say and what not to say when a friend is going through a rough time or a big life change. It also makes good use of other source material, such as when it explains ""ring theory,"" the idea that if you're not the central character in a trauma, then yes, you can still complain about how it makes you feel, but only to people less affected by said event. Or the shift vs. support responses. For instance, when a friend says they're exhausted, you could shift the conversation by saying, ""Oh, I haven't been sleeping well either,"" or you can support by asking something like, ""Why do you think that is?"" The encouragement is to notice things. Notice yourself, notice your friend, and notice what subtle effect your words and actions are having within a situation. It's a point well made.It also hit on some other behaviors that often feel natural but that actually need to be toned down, such as a barrage of fact-finding questions when you're at a loss for what else to say or do during a rough time, or the temptation to gloss over something when you are, in fact, rather insulted or hurt and need to say something.Thanks to NetGalley and The Experiment for this digital review copy."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71918445-ell,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is an excellent book for young adults. I am going to have my son read it when he reaches his teen years. The book is divided into two sections. The first section is about showing up for yourself (an often neglected line of thought). The second is about showing up for other people (an increasingly neglected line of thought). The author’s approach is simple and straight-forward, yet illuminating. I’ve covered much of the material in the book with clients and I appreciate the author’s simple, scaffolded approach. Four stars."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5923662-courtney,Rating 5 out of 5,"I really loved this book. The vast majority of the time I pick up a self-help book, it's a form of continuing education for my psych degree, but this one really did it for me. There's research (yay continuing ed!!), other books to check out, practical advice, and laying out those soft skills that they never explicitly teach you. It's so Millennial I loved it (especially the references to AIM), but that might also make it not-for-you if the casual language of the book isn't your style (I will take the straight talking, jokes, and swearing ANYDAY though). I also really appreciated the secular nature of it too - so many of the books I've picked up have a Christian subtext which is fine, but also not what I came to the party for. I will definitely be checking out any future books she puts out. I also really appreciated the reminders about showing up for yourself (I made a whole GoogleDoc of SEL ideas for my students), and will also 100% use the sympathy Venmo idea in the future. She has some good ideas and suggestions that were new to me, and does a solid job of explaining why things might happen and how you can respond, but she's not preachy, definitely recognizes everyone is in different shoes/places, and is trying to help people make healthy, affirming decisions/choices. So, essentially, if you are a Millennial who is here to keep learning and is down with the swearing, pick this up. Thanks to NetGalley/the publisher for an ARC!"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15758082-anne,Rating 1 out of 5,"I can't quite put my finger on why I disliked this book as much as I did (a lot). But I think it comes down to judgment. There was a such a lot of it in this book. Judgment about what constitutes a good relationship with yourself, and judgment about what constitutes a good relationship with others. It felt very censoriously-progressive-college-student to me, and I had enough of that when I was, well, a censoriously progressive college student. For a book ostensibly about kindness, this was surprisingly unkind."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26970414-kay,Rating 5 out of 5,"I was absolutely not expecting to give this book 5 stars, nor was I expecting to put this on my ""thought-provoking"" shelf, but this is a book I feel everyone needs. The book /feels/ very written for women even though not once does this book say it's for women, or not for men, or its target audience has a specific gender. I challenge that and it just feels that way because in society we only expect women to have emotional depth, we don't give men nearly as many opportunities to express emotions and invest in their relationships in meaningful, intentional, and vulnerable ways. Honestly I want more men to read this book too. I want my kids to read this book whatever gender them come out to read this book because everyone deserves to get to know themselves better. Everyone should know how to show up for themselves and for their people. Why don't we have more books or magazines or articles about how to be a better friend? Another concept I took away from the book and really liked is the difference between hobbies and activities. There are hobbies people, and there are activities people. Hobbies are specifically things you do over time to improve and get better at (though being good at a hobby is not a requirement to have a hobby). Where as activities you go out and do it as many times as you want but there's no overarching goal to get better at it. Going to the park to picnic with your friends--Activity! Going to the park to picnic with friends equipped with the tea sandwiches you've been learning to make and improving on--Hobby! And I love this clear differentiation. As a young adult, since graduating college and having more free time on my hands, one of the questions that STILL I feel I can never answer comfortably is ""what do you like to do in your free time?"" I have hobbies, but also in fact I DO spend a lot of time just doing different and random activities with my friends. And I feel this definition has helped clear up this question for me a lot in regards to how I answer. Do I answer with hobbies or do I answer with activities? Honestly, probably depends on how I'm feeling that day and the person that's asking! But this clear distinction is helpful in knowing myself better.A friend asked me to summarize the book and honestly I gave the crappiest answer. I still struggle with how to really encapsulate it. It's about confidence, but not really? It's about knowing yourself and how to take care of yourself and your people. It about being honest with yourself about what you want and need so you can be the best version of yourself.I was also very delighted to realize that I had bought and read the other book she's written (so far she's published 2 books). So I feel like I'm on a similar wave length as her and attracted to her approach to life (which is what both her books are about)."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63809356-gyan-yankovich,Rating 5 out of 5,"The Art of Showing Up is one of those books that I didn't realize how much I needed until I read it. (In fact, I've already referred to it twice for advice since getting my copy a couple of weeks ago.) This book includes the usual friendship advice—on making friends, on breaking up with friends, on dealing with conflict—but it also touches on situations I've never seen written about so practically: how to ask someone which pronouns they use, how to talk to a friend through infertility or miscarriage, how to comfort a friend who's loved one is incarcerated. Where so many books drop the ball, Rachel truly writes with every person and situation in mind. This is such a valuable resource and I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't benefit from reading this book."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28642282-sam,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ok I really enjoyed this!! Especially part one because I feel like a majority of us “show up” for others, but not for ourselves. ESPECIALLY during this traumatic time! I loved the tips, affirmations, journal entries, and self reflection questions.I think this is a great read for anyone who wants to truly practice more self care so that they can be the best version of themselves, for THEM. And it pairs perfectly with Digital Minimalism!"
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45197268-bronwyn,Rating 3 out of 5,"Lots of practical advice for healthy communication of your feelings and boundaries in friendships, tips on how to show up for yourself and in your relationships with other people. This book prompted a lot of self reflection on scenarios where the author’s advice would have been VERY helpful - but glad to have read it now!"
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51467437-donna-craig,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.5 stars, rounded up. This book wasn’t what I was expecting (a book on making and maintaining friendships), but it was fascinating in an odd way. The first half of the book is sort of a self-care manual. It contains a great deal of advice on getting to know yourself and your needs. The second half focuses on friendships. It details how to interact with others in a myriad of situations. Sometimes the book got wordy or too list-like. However, just as my mind began to wander, the author would offer another valuable nugget, and I was interested again. I did feel like there was so much focus on negative situations that people needing advice would simply learn how to drive others away. On the other hand, the specific examples of words and sentences to use in a variety of common situations may be invaluable to those who often feel tongue-tied. Definitely an interesting read. "
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29584538-sara-budarz,Rating 2 out of 5,"Somewhere between the description of the book and the writing of it, something must have changed, because even though the description talks about how to show up in relationships as an adult, reading this made me understand why so many other reviewers mentioned that it would be good for a 12-16 year old. It is definitely written mostly for that level, especially if you imagine the worst of high school (read: toxic, fake friendships, backstabbing, etc.). So overall just completely not what I expected, but I did finish it and there were a few things mentioned that felt relevant for all ages. They were:Showing up for yourself (that is, feeding yourself, getting enough sleep, being kind to yourself, showering) is a prerequisite of being able to show up well for others. It is just hard to be kind and compassionate and generous if we are falling apart. Ring Theory. When something bad happens, imagine the person (say, the person who just was diagnosed with something) in the center ring. Then the next most impacted person in the next ring. And so on. The rule: comfort in, vent out. You can only vent to people in a less impacted circle than you are. Everyone in your circle and closer you can only comfort. "
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55675375-mallory-johnson,Rating 4 out of 5,"My first self-helpy book and while I was apprehensive at first, I was pleasantly surprised (it was still cheesy at points for sure but still useful). The book is direct and demands a lot of self-reflection about things that I typically take for granted or don't feel are worth reflecting on (ex: what kind of small shit do I do every day that I actually hate doing and why am I still doing it and if I have to do it how can I make it better?) I feel like this kind of intentionality can only contribute to greater joy and contentment in everyday life.The book really shines when talking about relationships with friends - I feel like this is particularly timely advice as I soon move to a new city and attempt to make new friends and try to maintain strong relationships with my friends from afar. What I appreciate most about the book is that the author is always identifying things that we all feel or subconsciously know are true in our friendships but no one actually talks about or tells you how to deal with. It's refreshing"
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51753895-rachel-brown,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is practical, well-written, well-researched, and so important. I hadn’t expected, but really appreciated, the section on taking care of oneself, as the author points out that that’s a critical component in being able to show up for others. I’m glad I purchased a copy of this book because I highlighted the heck out of it. Highly recommend!"
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9959521-sarah,Rating 5 out of 5,"Brimming with helpful guidance, reminders, and scripts to help learn how to be a better you and a better friend. I want all my friends to read this."
13,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"A good read to start the new yearI'm trying to keep the stakes low for 2021, but even so this book offers some great reminders and advice about how to care for myself and others. It also makes me excited about being able to actually spend time with friends in real life again. "
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2226320-cindy,Rating 4 out of 5,"A self-help book for modern times (yes, even in the pandemic -- which happened after RWM wrote this!), The Art of Showing Up is about cultivating and nurturing your relationships, starting with the relationship you have with yourself. Normally, self-help books can grind my gears, especially when they err on the side of preachy. This book strikes a nice balance between being overly prescriptive and vaguebooking; one thing that's noticeably refreshing about this book is its emphasis on friendships in the age of adulthood, and how it's so important to nurture and grow your friendships (as well as evaluating and not being afraid to cast a critical eye on your more toxic friendships), as these are relationships that we voluntarily enter and grow as adults. The learnings from The Art of Showing Up aren't tips and tricks I can immediately apply (though the book does leave ample room to talk about effective allyship!), but I do look forward to applying those tweaks and changes into my life to be that much more present."
15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78512573-margo-morton,Rating 5 out of 5,"I don't usually read self-help/personal improvement books, but I love Rachel's writing that I've seen across the internet and on her blog so I knew I had to give this a go. I love the practicality and specificity of this book. You can ask, ""what do I do in a situation like *this*?"" and Rachel has an answer. It truly is a guidebook to being a good friend and taking care of yourself. Speaking of taking care of yourself, I so appreciate the way Rachel's approach to this subject. She acknowledges that everyone's different, with different abilities and expectations, but still offers a baseline that makes sense for everyone (really, everyone).I think anyone would be wise to have a copy of this handy for all of life's tricky circumstances!"
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57008322-katie-ellsworth,Rating 5 out of 5,"Such a great resource for those who feel at odds about how many friends they have, what their friendships are like, or how to handle situations with friends. I’ve often thought that I was less than because I don’t have the picture perfect “best friend” and this book healed my heart by reading that it doesn’t matter what my “best friendship” looks like. There are so many great tips for how to make friends, how to keep them, and how to have hard conversations and even how to break up with friends. This book is a huge help in normalizing whatever your friend situation is. I would highly recommend this to anyone. "
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15965497-girl,Rating 2 out of 5,"It's a book about friendships. And self-care. And getting to know oneself better. And there are some interesting things here, but mostly in the ""be a friend to yourself"" section. But YMMV. For me, the part about behaving in friendships was a) obvious and b) too millenial to be universal, but you might feel otherwise.(Miller, unfortunately, overuses exclamation marks. It took me out of the reading every! single! time!!!)"
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4707273-mary-anne,No Rating,"4.25 STARSHow this book ended up on my TBR: Anne Helen Petersen referenced this book recently in her newsletter, and my friend Deanna and I briefly discussed it. I was between audiobooks from the library, and I thought I'd pick this up!Confession: Sometimes, if I'm not entirely digging a book (especially an audiobook), I start to think about what rating I would give it and why, all whilst still listening to the audiobook. That's not a great sign, and yet, I rated this book rather highly.The idea behind the book is relatively simple. Rachel Wilkerson Miller is a journalist, and her argument is that a person cannot show up properly for their friends (and community) without showing up for themself. The first half of the book is essentially self-care, recognizing your boundaries, finding out what you care about. The second half is how to cultivate your community. Some reviews have called Miller's advice sort of simplistic (appropriate for young adults), but that doesn't make her work any less valid. Miller herself mentions a process that she had to go through when her marriage ended; she had to go through some self-discovery to see what really mattered to her.I think the self-discovery portion of the book is for anyone who goes through a life change. I found this section personally relevant because I've 1.) recently made a really big move, and 2.) I am forever trying to downgrade the time- and energy-suck that is my work. I've gone through at least two breakdowns, in part because I know I always default to doing more work, and also because I just don't know what to do with myself when not working. (Well, it was more that I don't have a local community I can visit separate from my partner.) I'm in a position now where it's useful for me to really think: how do I want to spend my time? What's important to me? What will help me feel fulfilled?The second part of this book is useful for anyone who has had any sort of difficulty with past/current relationships, especially friendships. For me, this connects with the first part because I want to prioritize my friendships. But what does that look like? Some of Miller's suggestions feel a little odd to me, but personally, it helped me to remind myself that I value my friendships and that I want the best for my friends. I will complain left and right about this wedding I agreed to be in. But then I felt bad about it, because I did agree to be in the wedding and could have said no, so I really need to just suck it up and accept my decision and be there for my friend. Another time, I was talking with a friend about some difficulties she's been experiencing, and it was on the tip of my tongue to say ""you know I'm here for you, right?"" But 1.) she was literally talking to me about it, and 2.) her comment wasn't about me. It was about her seeking services to provide her with what she needed. So instead of just thoughtlessly making a comment, I tried to listen and told her how proud I was that she was advocating for herself.So yes, I found this book helpful. I didn't always love Miller's tone (some of the language just kind of rubbed me the wrong way). And the audiobook narrator was Robin Eller. She was okay, if a bit high pitched, which did not increase my liking for the book. I feel mean for saying that.--PS. If you all ever go to The StoryGraph, let's be friends there! Here's my profile."
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5853661-meg,Rating 4 out of 5,"I knew I wanted to read this book when I saw the title. This book is great for those who enjoy self help books and don't mind profanity, as the author uses it frequently. I think the target audience for this book is a female Millennial. Things that are good: -Miller gives great examples of how to establish boundaries and express yourself. This is great for those of us who feel uncomfortable about burdening others with our problems and concerns. -Miller normalizes being alone and doing things by yourself. This is very important because a lot of people are codependent and afraid to do things by themselves. -This book encourages you to be yourself. - Miller gives a lot of great recommendations for other self help books. - Miller is really funny. I enjoyed the stories that accompanied the tips- especially the one about peeing. - I really enjoyed her advice about spending more time interacting with nature and drinking more water.- There is some really helpful information in this book, such as warning signs for medical emergencies. If you are in the market for an Adulting guidebook, this is a great choice. Miller provides a lot of helpful advice and information that you can refer back to whenever you need help. ""The Art of Showing Up"" is essentially your older sister here to give you advice on various life problems and situations. "
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/273182-aj,Rating 5 out of 5,"Such an important and vital book. As I was reading I kept wishing I had read this book before covid. Then I wished I had read it in early covid - it would have help guide and instill confidence in those conversations with friends about forming or not forming a pod with them. But I’m so glad to have gotten to read it now as the world slowly and tentatively begins to re-open and our friendships will migrate from zoom and FaceTime and other apps back to in person. I am so glad to have this guide to help navigate those journeys not back, but forward into a new world of friendship. Those that endured. Those that strengthened. And even those that began during this time of incredible isolation. I found myself wanting to send a copy of this book to all my closest friends and ask them to read it so we could process and debrief and discuss how we already show up for each other and how we could be even better in doing so. I definitely snapped some photos and sent them to my Deep Shallow Companion™️Even more valuable was the first section of this book that focuses on showing up for oneself. As a femme and a woman this is often something difficult to do - the standards and expectations seem impossible and I often give up and don’t try rather than face imperfection. Miller’s gentle but firm (compassionate in the truest sense of the word a la Neff and Germer) approach truly moved me and sent me to my journal for some introspection (shout out to Miller’s other book Dot Journaling!). Finally, as a therapist, there are very few clients I serve that I don’t think would benefit immensely from this book. It is always wonderful to add to my self of recommendations especially for books that don’t feel like a self-help book but rather a wise friend sitting you down and saying some really smart stuff that has you nodding and mmmhmming. Highly recommend. "
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68777716-amanda,Rating 4 out of 5,"A very affirming guide on how to both be there for yourself and your friends. It's very low-fluff and is packed with solid advice on how to nurture both friendships and the relationship one has with themself. This is definitely one of my favorite books of this type that I've read. While it wasn't earth-shattering, it's still a concise and practical guide for approaching all sorts of situations within different platonic relationships. I learned quite a few things and it's a fairly thought-provoking text in general, providing ample inspiration for further musing. There was also a substantial part of the book that was dedicated to the topic of self-care and the necessity of having a good relationship with yourself, which I found quite valuable, as it really does lay the foundation for all of one's other relationships. I do wish there had been more time and space devoted to online friendships, since they come with their own unique challenges and rewards, but, overall, I think this book is an excellent resource as it is.4.25 stars"
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2532724-jen-k,Rating 3 out of 5,"Maybe not as revolutionary as the blurb says but a solid and thoughtful book. I always appreciate these types of books as an opportunity to intentionally reflect on own practices. I liked the frame of ""showing up"" for self and others. I found myself being more mindful in conversations with friends to listen and show up and not reflect back to myself by relating with a similar experience. I really would like to continue to follow some of the advice given. Some was a bit over the top but perhaps I'm just lucky to not experience those over the top situations in my life."
23,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7893553-andria,Rating 4 out of 5,"Not quite what I was looking for but glad to have discovered it regardless. This is a great reference book filled with social scripts for all occasions, and the first half is an excellent self-care manual to boot. Thoughtfully constructed and full of references to other works for more in depth reading. Miller clearly put a lot of work into this.I would not recommend the audio version in most cases as not only is the content not suitable to the format but I found the reader's voice and delivery to be a mismatch with the tone of the book. It's jarring to hear somebody who sounds like a cartoon kindergarten teacher deliver the f-bomb repeatedly."
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3119234-gigi,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a great read, especially contextualizing it now with social distancing and coronavirus making friendships even harder to maintain. This is a great book for brainstorming ways to really show up for your friends, and makes it much easier to tell your friends what you need from them. Easy to read, funny and insightful."
25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6036716-grace-lyden,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love everything RWM writes and this book was no exception! The Art of Showing Up is packed with practical advice and thoughtful essays on self care and friendship. The section on Dos and Don’ts of showing up for friends’ big life events (e.g., serious illness, job loss, adopting a child) is a particularly good road map, and the whole book is wonderful at providing the words to communicate what you need. Will definitely be a library-to-buy!"

30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6412268-bella,Rating 4 out of 5,I really enjoy Rachel's writing and this was great. There is tons of great advice and practical tips for navigating difficult situations. I particularly enjoyed the first half of the book about showing up for yourself. 
31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1929383-elizabeth7781,Rating 4 out of 5,"I bought this book to give to a young adult in my life and then thought, but wait, what if I can learn something from it myself, even in my old age? Indeed, even though the advice within this book is intended for young adults, it's a fine refresher lesson in how to be in relationship with others. I appreciated that the book begins with 'showing up for yourself'. And by that, the author means 'show up for yourself every damn day' (yes, it's a chapter - or two - or three). It's far easier for many to be empathetic with others than it is to be kind to ourselves. Human tendencies being what they are, it's easier to find fault with ourselves than to ask questions like, ""what am I a 'natural' at?"" *coughs* Pretty sure I've never thought about myself that way. Self-care is critically important but we don't prioritize it for a number of reasons. The author also makes the point that there is a difference between being on social apps (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Tumblr, etc.) and being social. All of the undisciplined time you spend daily scrolling through these apps may be keeping you from truly connecting with others and/or using time to nurture yourself (go for a walk, read something that interests you). We all know this, but we need to be reminded. Again. I appreciated the book's frank discussion on coping mechanisms when sh*t gets hard. And constructive self-talk when your brain is lying to you. Anyone who has experienced bouts of depression knows how real that is. Again to the point of keeping things simple, I liked the author's ARE acronym for easing into conversation with new people: Anchor (comment on something around you at the moment), Reveal (one small thing about yourself, allowing yourself to be just a little vulnerable), and Encourage (asking the other person a similar, non-threatening question). I was pleased to see a discussion on the concept of 'radical candor', crediting Kim Scott's excellent 2017 book of the same name. Although it's written for those in formal leadership roles, it is certainly well applied to any meaningful relationship. There are two dimensions to radical candor: care personally and challenge directly. Radical candor provides a safe framework for a young adult to have those high passion/high stakes conversations with a friend when one or the other screws up or disappoints in expectations. It allows the caring to come through, making it safe to challenge directly. The Art of Showing Up provides conversations to have in these specific situations. In summary, I would highly recommend this book for any young adult who wants to improve their relationships and meet new friends. But I'd equally recommend it to everyone as a refresher in how to love yourself better."
32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26247238-lorena,Rating 5 out of 5,"In The Art of Showing Up, Rachel Wilkerson Miller shares information, examples, exercises, and resources to help you better understand and show up for yourself and others. I love the author’s voice; she sounds casual, warm, friendly, relatable, and encouraging. Reading this book, I felt like I would love to be her friend, which makes me inclined to trust her advice on how to be a better friend. This is a book I plan to return to often. Some sections work best if you allow plenty of time to explore the suggested questions and practices, while other sections might work best as a reference. The author encourages small steps repeated often to build tolerance to new habits, and she frequently acknowledges that we all have different contexts and abilities, so her advice feels feasible. I particularly loved her guidance on boundaries, which I think many of us struggle with. And I loved her discussion of “body neutrality,” an idea I wasn’t familiar with.Her discussions of how to cope when difficult things happen, in your own life or someone else’s, are especially relevant during the current pandemic. I found the concept of different levels of friendship very helpful; I now feel more confident about choosing how much to disclose to friends of different levels.I loved this book so much, and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in living a more authentic, aligned life and having better relationships of all kinds. Honestly, I would love to see everyone reading this book, and then perhaps we’d all have happier, healthier, more conscious relationships with ourselves and each other.I was provided an unproofed ARC through NetGalley that I volunteered to review. "
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3076786-beth,Rating 5 out of 5,"Some of what Miller shares isn't necessarily new information in the age of self help articles and books and lists, etc., floating around the net, but I really liked the first half of this book, which emphasizes showing up for yourself in order to show up for others. There are action items with most of the content so you can see and do. I felt I read it at exactly the right time and has given me much to think about. I read this while listening to Big Friendship on audio and they complement one another. Both acknowledge that friend relationships aren't as valued as romantic or familial, in much of the world, so people aren't really equipped to navigate the ups and downs that come with any long term connection. If anything, it's a great reminder to stop and listen and be present for the people you love in your life. My only complaint is that it seemed to end rather abruptly. Overall, I really enjoyed and would recommend."
34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3434930-carissa,Rating 2 out of 5,"Ugh! The first half of this book was okay, and thus, why I continued to read. The Art of Showing Up started out by talking about how to show up for ourselves and others. For some reason, I tolerated the showing up for ourselves part all right. By the time I was 70% of the way through, I was ready to pull my hair out.Miller comes across as condescending and superior. (Although I'm sure she could be a great person in real life. I'm just rating the book.) She treated her readers like idiots. I actually got some Mr. Collins vibes (from Pride and Prejudice) from her at times. I forced my way through to the end today just so I could stop dreading reading this book. I did not find much of the content relatable or helpful. Some of the conversation recommendations and general advice were the worst. Would not recommend. 2 Stars.*Swearing sprinkled throughout including between a dozen to two dozen f-bombs.*"

From that beginning, I would write off any other “work” one does from that point on."

I anticipated it being just another self help/relationship book and it is but the truth bombs it dropped were unexpected. I enjoyed it more than I thought. I would’ve given it 5 stars but I feel like the language was sometimes unnecessarily crass in an attempt to be ‘relatable.’ But honestly I think everyone should read this. Even if you think you’re good at showing up, which I thought I was. Seriously, read it and be willing to change for the better. The whole first half of the book is showing up for yourself which I wish I had read years ago. Then I might have understood my anxiety attacks when they were happening, thus diluting their intensity. The second half is about showing up for others, being a good friend and being more honest about your relationships. "

Aka boundaries you set for you and others.There was a spelling error about 30% in the book where an exclamation of ""TME"" that I could not get past. In addition the language and the way words and phrases were written was too casual for my liking in a published book. If you have been to therapy, have read quite a few books about taking care of yourself or articles and have practiced it, this book may be a bit redundant. If not, you might find it helpful. Spelling error and lingo used was not my cuppa tea."

In deutsch there is a term/ a word even that goes: Nächstenliebe. And it describes both: The love for yourself, as well as the love for others. Both in an immense state really, I think if you truly need a really good describtion for it or a defintion, it would be this book. The entire length of it, and even more. And I am also sure there is much written inbetween the lines. It is well. I hope, so are you :) xx"

Where was this book when I was younger?! I can count so many times when this book would've changed my perspective, my actions and even just myself.Miller covers a bunch of topics that largely fall into two sections, showing up for yourself and showing up for others in your life. Self-care, apologies, friendship break ups, relationship maintenance and more are all discussed within this book. I appreciated her frankness, her casual prose, and her references to other authors and experts. Personally, I was thrilled; it felt like this book was made for me, with references to Alison Green (Ask A Manager blogger and author), Celeste Headlee (NPR talk host, TEDTalk giver and author), etc; it felt like everyone whose personal and professional development work I admired was included in this book. Miller also includes lists of questions on varying topics that help you to start thinking about your values, approaches and general things that make you, YOU, that maybe you never really deeply considered before.And, what I really appreciated about this book, were the scripts. Miller provides scripts for almost every situation or potential issue she discusses in the books. These scripts can be adapted to whatever you need of them. As someone who worries frequently over what to say and being terrified of saying the wrong thing, these were so helpful. My library copy of book is covered in post-its (yes, library friends, I'm going to remove them before I return it). Since I found this book so helpful, I've already purchased a copy for me to mark up and keep on my bookshelf to pull off when I need some insight on varying issues. I'm not one to blanket recommend self-help books, because they're such personal thing and resonate differently with different people. However, you may be interested in this book if you're about to/are going through a major life change, struggling with other personal issues, or more. If you're a manager who worries about saying the right thing, I'd also recommend this book to you as well!I seriously wish I'd had this book in high school and college."

It had been awhile since I read a “Self-Help” book and I was able to take a lot away from this one. When I was younger I reread the American Girl “Care of Keeping of Friends” and “Care and Keeping of You” books over and over again, and this very much felt like those books adapted for millennial adults which I loved! I picked this up because I thought it would be valuable to evaluate how I was “showing up” for my friends during COVID-19 times but was pleasantly surprised to take some insights away about showing up for myself and my needs as well. I especially liked the framework/scripts that the author provides for supporting friends who are going through big life events (death in the family, job loss, miscarriage etc) and thought a lot about how I’ve responded (poorly) when friends have announced that they are going through rough times (breakups, mental health issues, etc). I also enjoyed that the author summarizes research from other related readings and writes about her own experiences in a very relatable way. She is a queer Black woman, and is able to appeal to a variety of readers and experiences.I’d recommend this to everyone who has an interest in being a better friend (or even partner for your significant other) or learning how to make some time for themselves (even in quarantine times!)"
41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9677605-christina,Rating 5 out of 5,"I will admit, I am a Wilkerson. I love her blog's weekly roundups. I love her writing at Vice. I will read pretty much whatever she writes..This book is exactly what it proclaims to be, a dissection of how to show up for yourself and others. It does not simply muse on self-care and proffer face masks and baths and journalling. It offers a discussion of all the ways in which we can show up and gives exercises, very specific advice (i.e. sample dialogues, how to approach very specific situations, ways to practice new tasks) and truly meets you where you are. If you are someone who has a lot of skills here or someone with absolutely none, someone with mental health issues or none at all, there is something here for you..Perhaps one of the most staggering facts here is that most social conversation is devoted to statements about the speaker’s own emotional experiences OR third parties who are not present. Think about it. Where are we showing up for our conversation partner? It makes you want to do better..I consider myself to be skilled at showing up for myself but could improve on showing up for others, and I still took away so much from this book. It articulated why I struggle with certain friends (it comes back to boundaries), why even though I love to plan events I still deserve to have my time honored and respected, and why pretending we don’t have needs IS a disservice to the friendship (throw that ""I'm a burden"" thinking in the trash where it belongs). Pretending we have no vulnerability prevents our friends from showing up for US. That is important..There is a particular poignancy to this work now. Taking care of ourselves and those around us is so important during this time. Wilkerson cites a recent Pew study that says one in 10 adults feel lonely all or most of the time. I wonder what that number is now. If you are a lover of self-reflection and self-improvement, add this book to your list. I read a lot of these books and many I don’t give a second thought to (often don’t offer anything “new” to this over-thinker, happy self-analyzer, personality-test aficionado). But this book truly does..Thanks to Net Galley and The Experiment Publishing for providing the advance copy. All opinions are my own."
42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32434093-jessica-ranard,Rating 4 out of 5,"I'm not exaggerating when I say The Art of Showing Up changed my life. Rachel Wilkerson Miller talks about what it means to show up for yourself and your ""people,"" and how you can't show up for your people if you don't show up for yourself. We all have heard the phrase ""You can't love someone if you don't love yourself,"" and as someone who self-abused for years, the concept of ""loving myself"" frankly sounds a bit overwhelming but ""showing up for myself"" seems significantly more possible. From naming your own wants, desires, needs to giving practical advice on how to cancel a last minute friend hangout, give a sincere apology, tell someone that they hurt you, or if need be, kindly and firmly end a friendship. If you are someone who struggles with boundaries, this book will help you learn what yours are, and what it means to respect the boundaries of others. "

Not only does the author constantly acknowledge when or how her tips may not work for a specific scenario — such as class, race, personal comfort level — she also gives you ideas for how to adapt or permission to simply not worry about something. The most important part of this book however, is the plentiful examples of actual language you can use and build off of in many many different scenarios. They’re incredible useful, and being exposed to some of this haphazardly in early college is what set me on the path of trying to practice how to use language in a specific way. Really great resource. "

I thought this book had a lot of very, very good advice for maintaining friendships and I loved the second section, which focused on that (with the caveat that Miller presents this advice as fact, mostly, which is not necessarily a bad thing but there could be room for more nuance). There's one chapter that lays out a lot of common scenarios for when life gets hard with what-to-do and what-not-to-do lists that I thought was incredibly helpful and well thought out. The first section was nothing new if you are someone who knows about self-care, but I did love the reminders about being compassionate with yourself if you are really going through it. "
45,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17204457-deonna-anderson,Rating 4 out of 5,"I appreciated this book, especially for the scripts that it provides for tough conversations many of us will inevitably have with loved ones. It was a little different from what I was expecting but that isn’t a bad thing. Would recommend for people thinking about the role they play in their friendships and wanting to deepen them — lots of practical guidance and prompts for getting more clear about who you are and your needs and desires. (I read How We Show Up by Mia Birdsong earlier in 2020 and this feels like a good companion to that book.)I think this is a book I’ll return to when it’s time for me to have hard conversations."
46,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3840909-lacey-losh,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is just as much about showing up for yourself as showing up for others. I found many of the self-focused exercises thought provoking and useful, and there were parts of the book that cover areas of life I didn’t feel the need to focus on personally. Other sections were filled with practical advice on setting boundaries, compassionately navigating your relationships, and practicing body neutrality (which is a brand-new concept for me). If you want to spend some time getting to know yourself better, or meaningfully set intentions on how you interact with your people and focus your priorities, this is a great place to start."

I liked the self-care tips because they were some good reminders, and I felt like the advice about showing up for others was affirming what I already knew, but there were some nice tips that I think will be cool to try in the future. I liked it, but didn’t love it. One thing I didn’t love was that friendships from this perspective seemed... self-centered? self-serving? I feel like the purpose of friendship is just broader than meeting our needs for friends. I will definitely utilize the “how to make friends” section when we move to Plano next year! "

Was hoping for a book that would help me understand what I'm going through, but I realize that's a tall order. People seem really detached these days, and they'd rather stay away than attempt an awkward comfort such as bringing food or writing a sympathy card. I am feeling exhaustion and bitterness about being ignored in my time of grief, and while I can't control the actions of those around me, or make people show kindness in the way I want them to, I figured at least I could read this and make sure I am doing well for others when they go through a hard time in their life. But even that part was sort of missing from this book, at least for me. Who knows, the book might help other folks, but it wasn't the right fit for me."

It could have been a little on how the narrator read the audiobook too, but it was truly the approach to her words that got more obnoxious. "
51,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’m usually not a huge reader of the self-improvement genre, but the offer of an ARC for this book hit right at the moment when the stay-at-home orders started to pour in, and things felt very disconnected. Much like Marie Kondo’s The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up told us things we already knew (if you don’t need it, want it, or use it, get rid of it) in a friendly, more nuanced way, Rachel Wilkerson Miller captures what you have heard about what it means to be a friend and repackages it in a conversational, modern tone familiar to the new adult/millenial population. The first half of the book focuses on taking care of yourself, or as Miller puts it, showing up for yourself. The second half expands on those ideas to take care of your relationships and the people you care about. My big takeaways? Really listen, set and respect boundaries, and allow things to change, including yourself and other people. But Miller has phrased in a much more eloquent manner, while making the book feel like a conversation with a good friend. I received a copy of this book from the publisher via NetGalley for an honest review."

The book is very heavy on providing literal scripts, which don't match my tone or values, so I personally could do without. But I can definitely see the value and appreciate the handholding. No more ""I just don't know what to say"" excuses."

I liked how the first half of the book was about showing up for yourself, because before you show up for anyone else, you have to show up for yourself. Shouldn’t be an especially revolutionary concept but here we are 🙃 The segue into showing up for other people was nicely done, and I’ve come away from this book with a bunch of actionable items for myself and the people in my life.

It went through things from start to finish (not assuming that the reader has lots of preexisting knowledge/skills about taking care of oneself or showing up for others), specific dos and don'ts, and sample messages to use as templates. Some of the things it covered were things I felt like I already had a handle on, but the author's goal was clearly to make sure that she covered the basics, and I think that's admirable."

58,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214942-rach,Rating 4 out of 5,This is a really helpful guide on many things but I found the sections about standing up for yourself and how to set boundaries resonated really strongly with me. It’s great to have an outside person say that no one can tell you how you feel or what to do with your life. Being in control of how you react to a situation you are presented with is part of growing into yourself.

This is 100% the type of book where you get out of it what you put into it. Get a notebook and start doing the exercising, don’t just read them! Define your values, reflect on your past, challenge your habits. It’s worth it. 4/5 simply due to stylistic preferences, but this is a book I would recommend to anyone working on truly showing up for themselves and for others."

I also wanted to keep myself accountable.I loved this book. I think about emotional labor A LOT (which you will know if we are friends and I’ve ever talked your ear off about the topic) and I still learned so much. What I love about this book is it’s thorough as all get out. How to create a home you love living in? Covered. Things that could be signs you or a loved one are having a serious medical issue? Covered. Having hard conversations with loved ones? Covered. I hate the term “adulting” but if you’re looking for a comprehensive look at that, from a social and emotional perspective, this is it.In the end, I walked away with many ideas of ways to be there for my people more, and also had a better idea of which relationships I cared to nourish.

This one was a book club pick, and I found myself not being able to put it down. The first section about showing up for yourself was much needed especially since I feel like I’m always there for others and forget about myself in the process. This is one of the books I am going to recommend to my students who love nonfiction, and I hope they gain as much from it as I did."

If you don’t decide how you want to live your life, other people will decide for you. - Making space means you have to say no sometimes, no to your beloved friends, to your coworkers, to things that you want, to the things you generally want.3. Don’t look down: if you let yourself think about the future too much, or try to game out of every possible outcome, you can quickly find yourself overwhelmed and frozen, unable to do anything, including basic survival tasks.4. Make friends with people from different life stages: talking to people from different generations brands our worldview and makes us kinder, smarter, and more empathetic. These friendships are also just practical.- Casual friendships emerge after about 30 hours of interaction. Good friendships can require around 140 hours.- Don’t spend a lot of time talking about an outside third party. Don’t dedicate too much air time to people who are not you and not your friend. - We can only manage 3 to 5 super intimate relationships at a time, 9 to 15 close friendships. - Admitting and owning your limitations is a major part of showing up.5. If you have a complaint, you have a request. So take your request to the appropriate party and then move on.6. Naming your behavior can be a good gut check: it forces you to stop and ask yourself if you want to share this information, and whether it’s appropriate to share with this particular person right now.- Be specific with your compliments. Your friends deserve to know exactly why they’re important to the world.7. The goal is noticing, processing, and naming to spot patterns.8. Confrontation is emotional labor that can cost real social or professional capital. It’s frustrating when friends and colleagues don’t recognize the offer to share the burden."

91,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76895375-elizabeth,Rating 5 out of 5,"I felt like this one was written just for me! I’ve been not showing up for a good part of my life for neither myself or friends and family. I’ve managed to focus my energy on my kids without looking inward or outward for anything. To say this has been a problem for me would be an understatement! I’ve been called flakey at times from those who have mattered most and instead of taking their criticism and applying it, I allowed myself to feel the hurt instead. What I’ve realized now through therapy and a lot of self-work that I had a lot to work out within first. I had to be good with myself in order to be good for others and I’m still working on it. BUT…I’m a lot better! I’ve learned to say “no” when I needed to the time, I’ve noticed triggers that set off anxiety, worked on my breathing, and most importantly made attempts to do better. I couldn’t even see the patterns when I was younger and internalized the feelings of unworthiness. It takes a while to let things go, especially when you’re aware of your shortcomings but still isn’t accepted. This book was a huge reminder to take time to heal, focus on the good, and do the best I can when it comes to supporting others. Most of the time my anxiety got in the way. My worry about something not going right or being judged kept me from building lasting relationships that I now wish I fostered. If you’re struggling with showing up, especially during this time, give yourself a break, take a deep breath and pick up this book! You will find solace."
92,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/697688-jessica-daly,Rating 5 out of 5,"If you'd asked me about this book 6 months ago, I'd have told you it is wonderful; well researched, full of helpful, practical tips delivered in a friendly but firm way, as though the writer is your slightly older friend who is about 700% more mature and emotionally intelligent than you are.Now that I've just read it in the midst of a global pandemic and long-overdue uprising and political awakening relating to the state of racial justice in America? It's not just wonderful--it's necessary. So much of this advice is urgently relevant today, particularly the sections about ""How to Be a Good Ally"" and ""Showing Up for Yourself When Shit Gets Hard"".Anyone who remains in doubt should look through the section where Rachel offers specific dos and don'ts for ""Showing Up for Friends Who Are Dealing with Big Life Events"". We've all been in at least one or two of these situations and just glancing through it reminded me of the people who were helpful or...not so helpful when it was my turn to go through the shit. I am certain I will be returning to this for reference the next time something bad befalls someone I love, to figure out how to show up for them effectively and to not make things worse.I'm so glad this book reached my hands when it did. I feel a little less helpless than I did before."

It left me hungry and wishing for a deep sense of community like the author has built and fought for.I appreciated specific scenarios and examples of what the author did to cultivate community and how they continued to show up for their friends and neighbors.Adult relationships are hard and I appreciated her for normalizing that and also giving a space to dream about what they could be.There was part of me that was restless and frustrated that the book didn't have more of a ""magical wand"" approach to replicating what the author shared about. AND I think every good book should leave you hungry and wanting more. I think going through this book with a group of friends seems very intentional and creating space for the very thing it's based on.Community can be hard and has to be cultivated, but the art of still showing up and showing up and showing up can speak volumes. 💜"

95,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5159982-lili,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have a few friends who struggle with myriad challenges, so I’ve learned the hard way that just showing up for them makes all the difference. Be it a well timed text that says “I’m here and I care,” or a drive across state lines to actually show up on the doorstep or whatever other form showing up takes, I know that it is important. But I was still curious about what more could a 300+ page book teach me about the topic. Should I be showing up more for my family? More for my other friends? If so, how do I do that?In the Introduction, the author takes care to describe what “showing up” means in the context of the book: noticing that the behavior, words, circumstances, etc communicates a need; processing what has just been noticed; naming the bigger narrative and recognizing its legitimacy and worthiness; and responding in a way that makes the individual feel seen, heard, supported, etc. Afterward, the book is divided into two distinct parts: showing up for yourself and showing up for others.The first section about showing up for yourself was interesting and insightful. So much so that, before I moved on to the second section, I ordered two copies (plus two blank journals) for two of my friends. The book wasn’t due to be published for another week, but by some miracle, it was available in stock. The striking thing about the first section was that it immediately started with a personal values exercise, and then constantly referred back to it. Preferences were rooted in values. Priorities - how you allocate your time, money, and energy - were also rooted in values. Personal boundaries were rooted in values. Even how you administer self care when your life turns upside down was rooted in personal values. So if you are serious about getting the most out of the first section, definitely invest the time in thinking through the values exercise. And the last chapter of the section - showing up for yourself when life gets challenging - is definitely worth the price of admission.Because the first section spoke directly to me (I have tremendous difficulty with setting and enforcing boundaries), I was reluctant to start the second section about showing up for others. But not just any others - specifically “your people,” which includes anyone that you care about and have a connection with. This section is similarly constructed to the first section: beginning with why and how to make friends, continuing with how to keep friends once you’ve made them and how to show up for friends who are having challenges in their lives, and finally ending with how to address friendships that may have soured. I didn’t get as much out of this section as the first, but it was still worth the read.The tone of the book is very colloquial, which attempts to speak directly to the reader, as if the author was engaging you, the reader, in a one-on-one conversation. It’s also littered with profanity and sexuality. Neither of my friends will mind, but some readers may. The book could have easily been written without either, but that wasn’t the choice that the author made.Overall, I enjoyed the book. I think it would be useful for anyone who struggles with any aspect of self-care, as well as anyone who struggles with creating and nurturing appropriate friendships.I received this book as a digital advance reader copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."

Numa tentativa de explorar mais a fundo como é que posso estar mais presente a nível pessoal, profissional e social, mergulhei nas páginas do The Art of Showing Up sem saber bem o que esperar e terminando a leitura com a sensação de uma agradável surpresa. The Art of Showing Up procura otimizar a forma como nós estamos mais presentes e disponíveis na vida dos outros e nas nossas próprias emoções e fases de vida. Sabemos que somos mais felizes quando conseguimos ser mais assertivos nas nossas escolhas, tempo e sentimentos e também mais disponíveis para as pessoas que amamos. Este livro leva esses fatores em consideração. Está dividido em dois capítulos: a primeira metade do livro dedica-se inteiramente a trabalharmos as nossas reações aos que os outros nos fazem, pedem ou comunicam, às coisas fantásticas e ruins que nos acontecem, como estabelecer limites ou processar sensações e como gerir o tempo para sermos tudo o que ambicionamos: pessoas com tempo para si mas também com tempo para os seus, que trabalham com dedicação mas não deixam o trabalho consumir as suas vidas, que se preocupam com a sua saúde e com o mundo que as rodeia. A segunda metade do livro centra-se nas nossas relações e na dificuldade que sentimos em conseguir gerir o nosso tempo e disponibilidade para atender a todas as pessoas da nossa vida nas várias etapas que vamos enfrentando, à medida que crescemos. Este é um daqueles livros que é diferenciador não pelo conteúdo que traz mas pela forma como o comunica. Não tendo aqui soluções milagrosas ou segredos que nós não saibamos já, a forma como Rachel Miller desconstrói tudo o que sabemos e volta a conceptualizar de uma forma inovadora foi, para mim, uma lufada de ar fresco. Ler certas ideias (que eu achava já ter bem presentes) de uma maneira diferente fez sentido para interiorizar melhor as lições que cada capítulo tenta partilhar. Surpreendentemente, achei o livro verdadeiramente prático, não no sentido de nos desafiar a qualquer tipo de atividade mas por a própria autora partilhar sempre inúmeros exemplos práticos para evidenciar ou ajudar a processar a ideia que desenvolveu. É inspirador na medida certa. Temas como a gestão do tempo, reconfortar amigos em alturas difíceis, esquematizar de forma sublime os diferentes graus de intimidade que temos com as nossas pessoas, estabelecer limites e apoiar minorias são apenas alguns dos inúmeros tópicos disponíveis numa leitura rápida e muito acessível. Fui surpreendida com algumas das propostas e refleti muito sobre os meus comportamentos (e os das pessoas que me rodeiam). Foi um livro que me permitiu tirar apontamentos, levar algumas dicas valiosas para a vida e que cumpriu o propósito inicial: ajudar-me a ser mais presente para mim e para os meus. Recomendo!"
97,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1484853-simone,Rating 3 out of 5,"""This is probably because hobbies combine three of my favorite things: learning new stuff, buying new stuff, and—according to every personality test I’ve ever taken and my natal chart—an obsession with self-improvement.""So this was an odd book to read just after Big Friendship: How We Keep Each Other Close because they cover a lot of same ground. So if you don't read them in tandem, YMMV. In general, I picked this up because I've been a fan of some of RWM's internet writing, some of which is re-published and re-purposed here. But I think I hoped this would have more personal writing than it did. It was definitely more of a self-help book (that's not bad, it's just not exactly what I was expecting). It was closer to a mash-up of The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters and There Is No Good Card for This: What To Say and Do When Life Is Scary, Awful, and Unfair to People You Love. I think, especially for younger people, this has a lot of good, tangible advice. I especially liked some of the scripts that she offers, as if to demonstrate that being honest with people and communicating your feelings and needs can be done! I agree with this advice. But there were moments I wondered if this book was meant for pod-people needing to imitate humans. Like, notice things about your friends - like the names of their partners or where they grew up - and like, yes? Do you have any relationships currently where you don't do this? Are those successful? If you are generally a good person and feel like you have successful relationships with people (and yourself) I would move ahead to ""No Good Card for This"" (linked above) as like an advanced class in showing up for people, this is sort of a 101 class. Anyway, it was not a long read, and I liked some parts of it more than others (her quote above on crafts and hobbies is deeply me. I didn't realize how much obtaining a new hobby means shopping and so that hobbies combine my love of shopping and my love of learning) so if you're library has a digital copy you might check it out!"

For me, it was a 3 star because I got an ebook library loan experience - which I don't think is the best way to read it.That being said, I did enjoy it. It's exactly as the title suggests, the first half being about showing up for yourself. The author says, ""There's not much space for generosity, confidence, or vulnerability when you're constantly worried about whether you have enough and are enough."" She gives a lot of suggestions and prompts for getting to know yourself and what you have to offer. I like the way she writes, one bit that rang true for me was, ""I love a grandiose resolution and the ensuing shame spiral once it fails as much as the next gal... but the goal here isn't a big makeover montage; it's acceptance. ""She acknowledges that ""the same solutions show up again and again: Exercise. Make sure you're getting enough sleep. Don't drink too much. Meditate. Practice gratitude. Take a vacation. Get off social media. Volunteer. Take your meds. Go to therapy. ""This makes me go *ugh* because it's so painfully obvious and basic (and why am I reading this)! But to see even obvious concepts laid out nicely with research backing them up helped me think about a few in a different light / encourage me to take action. Specifically, getting off social media and volunteering. The author suggests that ""Not hurting your own feelings means making the choice to stop spending valuable time and energy pissing yourself off. "" Which is true, and it's easy to not notice where your time/energy is actually going. She gives a lot of actionable things you can do to delve deeper into these concepts and apply to your life.The second half of the book is about showing up for others and it was interesting to read, it features a lot of specific situations and problems along with examples of phrases to use in tough situations. It's a good book, but because I got it as an ebook library loan it's not as useful to me as it could be if you owned a copy and wanted to take the time to really dig into each section/ go back to it for reference when a particular situation arises. A lot of the book feels very ""yeah, obviously"" as you're reading it, so it becomes hard to remember specifics. The general *feeling* I'm taking away from this read is to be more mindful in every aspect, really stay curious and open and be kind."

I opened the covers of this one with a bit of trepidation, expecting more of the same. I am happy to say that I enjoyed this book MUCH more than I thought I would! It earns 3.5 stars rounded to 4 stars from me!This book is impressively comprehensive; it offers practical advice and even sample conversations to help you deal with situations and relationships that are difficult. The book is divided into two sections - how to be there for yourself, and how to be there for others. Being there for yourself and taking care of yourself is something we often neglect to do. Miller helps you take an in-depth look at yourself, identify your values, what is important to you and what's not. She also helps you assess what's working for you in your life, your job, your relationships, where and how you live, and what is not working for you. You'll read about levels of friendship, setting boundaries, what self-care encompasses and several other topics. This is a comprehensive look at YOU, and at the end of it, you will know yourself and what you want for yourself and your life better.Part Two deals with How to Show Up for Others. It tackles how to make and maintain friendships, how to deal with relationships that may need extra work, how to navigate through hard times in your life or the life of your friend, how to have the hard conversations when someone is acting out of character or doing things that trouble you. It offers suggestions as to how to make your relationships work for you, and on the flip side, what to do when they don't.Practical advice and helpful sample conversations are offered throughout the book. This is a good read for anyone wanting to take better care of themselves and want to build strong, mutually beneficial relationships with others.My thanks to NetGalley and The Experiment for allowing me to read a copy of this book in exchange for an unbiased review.

This is a great, actionable guide made up of many small tips. I’m not really interested in most self-help these days because the ideas seem to be either too basic or really unobtainable. But I have followed Rachel Wilkerson Miller’s work for a while. She is a Black queer author with a very approachable brand of self improvement which consistently feels fresh and clever, not redundant or overwhelming. The book starts with how to show up for yourself: from deep dives into your preferences and priorities, an assessment of how you spend your time, money, and energy, how to help yourself through dark times, and how to ask for help. The second half discusses showing up for your friends: making new friends, being reliable, acknowledging when your friend needs help, and having tough conversations, with specific wording for helping you have these talks effectively. While some of her suggestions are meant to push you to work harder in your relationships, others involve taking a step back, like doing less in times of crisis. This might be a nice guide to give to a young person in your life, but I also think you’d be doing yourself a disservice by counting yourself out from a straightforward guide like this. We can all use a reminder to show up for ourselves and our friends, even if some of it is advice we’ve heard many times. It would pair really nicely with Big Friendship by Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman if you’re feeling like your friendships need some more focus in your life. Even as someone who has learned plenty about empathy through my career, I took away tons of new tips, some of which I’ve already started utilizing in my relationships. I can see myself revisiting this on various occasions in the future. "
102,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3885531-p-j,Rating 5 out of 5,"I took longer to read this book than normal because I felt it was important to actually think about the topics being discussed, especially during the first section (showing up for yourself). During the first section, I took the time to reflect on each question and took or retook the quizzes suggested. I was surprised by some of the results from the quizzes (especially ones I've taken before). Upon further reflection, I think the social distancing/staying at home due to the coronavirus changed some of my responses from how I would previously have behaved. I bookmarked several areas in the book and think it will be interesting to go back later to see how things have changed. I am a person who doesn't like confrontation and gained a lot of insight into how that can be causing me further stress and anxiety so I plan on implementing some of the tactics (once we're back in more normal social situations). One of the things that I was able to implement now was unfollowing people on social media that made me feel bad/upset/angry/frustrated and it has honestly helped a lot. I personally liked the casual writing of the book and have followed Rachel's blog for awhile so I already was familiar with her voice and knew it worked for me. I enjoyed how she gives examples of things you could say in different situations (although at times it was redundant) to show up for yourself/others because, while some of the examples were not things that felt authentic to me, there was always at least one thing that I thought would be realistic for me.

This book emphasizes the importance of Showing up for yourself first before showing up for your People. It's normal for us to want to help others and show up in time of need, but we can do it more efficiently only when we show up for ourselves. This book helps us find us tools which can help us do that. First of all, it helps you sit with yourself and get to know you better. I personally found a lot of answers about me which I wasn't aware of before. Then it talks about showing up for yourself by giving yourself space, using various very engaging self care techniques, and also helping ourselves during tough times. Then comes, Showing up for others part. It talks everything from how to make friends, how to keep them to how to notice the little changes which needs showing up. At the end of the day, it makes a better person and a better friend. I loved the way this books talks about serious issues in a very lucid and calming way. Rachel, in the end talks about her personal experiences and how following the book by word can be a tough thing, but it makes us think for sure. This book is quick read to self care and you're gonna love it. I think this is a book that you deserve to read."
104,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a great book!It's sort of a guide how to show up for yourself but also how to navigate friendships when they're starting out, if something becomes uncomfortable, and even ending friendships.This is such a great book diving into how complicated relationships can be and showing examples, sample scripts, and other ways to be supportive or help a friend through a hard time. The first half of this book is about figuring yourself out so you can take care of yourself properly. It explores mental and physical health and how to speak up when you need help, which we all do.The second half is about expressing those needs to other people and making and maintaining friends. This book understands that sometimes friendships change over time or sometimes it's hard to support a friend when you're going through a hard time and this book shows you how to navigate those feelings. By figuring out what you need, and communicating to others what you can provide and what you need it takes the stress out of charting the unknown. While the crux of this book is talk to people, it shows you how to talk to people and tackles a variety of difficult conversations and concepts.This is a book everyone should be required to read and reflect on!

105,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"As a recent college graduate, I read this hoping to get some life advice on adulthood as I set out into the world for the first time. I was disappointed. Most of the practical advice is common knowledge at best (making sure you sleep, eat, exercise, go to the doctor, etc). The pieces on social interaction offered little depth past basic social graces that hopefully most people would know past high school--saying your pleases and thank yous, not making fun of peoples' names, and expressing condolences, to name a few. While I could see the social scripts potentially being helpful for someone who struggles with social cues, there is no real insight on how to cultivate meaningful relationships with others. Tied together with the condescending tone this book is written in, I felt like I had been talked down to for several hundred pages and deemed incompetent. My larger grievance with this book is a lack of understanding that everyone is entering adulthood with different levels of ability and wealth. While there are disclaimers that the advice is not applicable to everyone, most of it will really only be helpful to those who are baseline mentally and physically well with some amount of financial stability."

Kind of like a recipe book, it's a little hard to read straight through because you really want to have it in your back pocket when you need it. But alas - borrowing ebooks makes that not possible because they do indeed have to go back. This is partially what attributed to it taking me THREE months to read this and multiple loans from Libby!! But I'm glad I read it, even as slowly as I did. I didn't know much of what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised by how the book is split into two parts. Part 1 is a focus on the relationship with oneself and Part 2 is with others. This book is full of actually useful tips, scripts, and exercises to do to better understand who you are and how you relate to your people. Rachel has a clear and strong voice and an interesting personal story. I'm looking forward to sitting down and properly going through the questions in part 1 - a little bit of self reflection probably everyone could use in 2021. I highlighted a million things and I know I'll be reaching for this again in the future."

This book had some helpful nuggets and was organized in a part 1 about caring for yourself, and a part 2 about interacting with others. The first part had a lot of reflection questions and lists, so the audio version might not have been the best for this, unless you can sit down with a pad of paper and write notes in the moment. I typically listen to books while on walks, so this didn't work for me and I just tried to reflect on the fly. The second half was divided into different scenarios, but each chapter was fairly long, and there were lots of sub-sections that weren't labeled in the table of Vincent's, so going back in to find the part that's relevant to you would be very difficult. The author also wrote in a very casual tone. She used ""like"" a lot; like, it was annoying! Also she threw in lots of curse words, for example, if someone acts in a sh*tty way. These felt unnecessary. As others have mentioned, the book feels like it was written more for the 16-26 year old demographic. That said, there were some good tips, and I would recommend a paper version to a young person. I just don't think the audio worked well for this book."

The talk about being there for friends and working through some different scenarios of tough conversations with friends or partners that ran the gambit from small annoyances, to being completely unsupportive, and even beyond I thought were good.That being said, overall, this was just your average self-help book only written from a younger person's point of view. Ideas like take care of yourself, be kind, show grace and give yourself grace were the main takeaways. These are obviously incredibly important, but nothing that couldn't have been said in like 10 pages unless you need one of the specific cases she talks about.I did like these two quotes, though:- ""If you don't decide how you want to live your life, other people will decide for you.""- ""Give what you have, and trust that that will be enough."""
109,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9404442-riah,Rating 5 out of 5,"I really enjoyed this book. I wholeheartedly believe everyone should give it a read/listen! It definitely shined a greater importance on being there for yourself first and foremost that I've definitely not been in the past. Which, duh obviously, as that's the point of the book! It also described scenarios that were all too familiar for me, such as letting other people treat me more than unfairly for way too long that I should have allowed; and it also presented similar situations where I have been in the wrong, or been unclear, inconsiderate, and unfair to others. Hearing the situations in the book definitely gave me pause and a moment of reflection, and some moments of validation. Not every topic in the book will apply to everyone's situation, and I like that the author acknowledged that and even said if you're not in a place to hear this advice feel free to skip ahead. It offers a good balance of accountability on all sides of relationships. All in all, my take away was to just really take care of myself, address areas of fault and work towards improving myself, but also acknowledge the faults in others to work towards a reconciliation or move on to them all together."
110,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2809380-sharon,No Rating,"I quit reading this book shortly after the author told people they should shower less often. After that point, I knew I would have a hard time accepting any more advice from her, so it didn't make sense for me to keep reading her advice book.I did skip ahead to the very last section about friend breakups. It seemed insightful and well-structured, true to what I expect from Miller's articles. I gave it an honest try, but ultimately I disagree with the author. I don't think that the first part of the book needs to be read before the second one, or for that matter, that they even need to be in the same book at all. A hodgepodge of self-care advice that includes stuff like drinking water has little bearing on how to communicate directly and honestly with friends.I admit that I might have felt differently if I'd read this book 5-10 years ago. At this point, the self-help stuff just seems obvious and boring because I've already learned it the hard way or read it in other books."
111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/330255-stven,Rating 2 out of 5,"Basically the advice in this book seems to be sensible. I don't feel I'm exactly the average reader the advice is pitched to help, though. Under the heading ""Your Values,"" for example, the author suggests a sequence of self-checks including ""How much time you spend on your phone and what specifically you're doing on it."" I don't actually ""spend time"" on my phone. I realize there are people who do; I've been in more than one waiting room where I've brought a book to read and noticed that other people pull out their phones and do whatever it is people do who ""spend time"" on their phones. But that's them, and it's not me. Skimming later chapters, I find useful suggestions about what to say to your friends in pivotal situations -- like, someone's lost a job or decided to reveal an unexpected sexual preference or, just, you know, something that might be sensitive to discuss, and it'd be better not to screw up the conversation. It's not bad. It's just for someone who's not exactly me."

When I started reading it at first, I was a bit hesitant, as it was a first of a kind for me to read, I didn't really know what to expect. But soon after starting, I started engaging with it.It contains two major chapters, the first one focuses on one's self, and how to be there for yourself first. Second one, on how to be there for others, and that implies anyone you care about.Even if some things are maybe obvious in this book, It still was a good hit remembering, when things were obvious, it still was a good refresher. It contains solid advice and reminders we all think we already know; -and we do! But tend to overlook, forget or just ignore, then generally resulting in bad habit making and behaviours towards ourselves, and others. Now, I didn't agree to everything in this book, naturally, as there were some personal opinions, or very specific scenarios which I didn't really relate to, but overall, the ideas and techniques supported in this book, I find interesting and can come handy."

The writing style was very easy-going and the book read like an engaging one-sided conversation with a close friend, which I enjoyed. But what ultimately stopped me from reading the book was the advice. For example, the first part of the book focused on how we can practice self-care realistically and holistically. And here's where things got weird. She wrote a section about showering. She shared that she wasn't a fan of showering and essentially found it a waste of time. And her advice was, ultimately, that we shouldn't shower daily because various studies show it's not good for our skin. This is one of the many examples of oddly specific advice given to her readers that was rooted in the author's own unique self-care preferences. I still highly recommend her podcast ""Oh, I Like That"" and will try to read her next book, should she decide to write another. "
114,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book has a lot of great tidbits on topics like showing up for yourself, setting boundaries, having tough conversations with loved ones and talking about sensitive topics with friends. Rachel Wilkerson Miller writes in a very conversational and casual way, truly showing her personality through her words and making the reader feel like she’s a friend of their own. I found that some tips were probably not practical for most people, and at times I felt like the book could have been more succinct. However, I appreciated Miller’s vulnerability in speaking about her own struggles and how those experiences informed her writing. I listened to this on audiobook and I enjoyed it enough that I would like to get a physical copy to refer back to certain sections when I might need to read them again. There are definitely gems that I really needed to hear at this time in my life, and I think everyone will find something that they resonate with in this book. "
115,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7261586-dawn,Rating 3 out of 5,"This wasn’t a bad book and had some good advice. I feel it was aimed at a younger audience with less life experience to draw on. Great relationship book for young adults.Best nugget was the ring theory: the person closest to the trauma is in the centre ring, with people in sequential outer rings depending on their closeness to the trauma. Comfort in/dump out. I listened to the audio book. The narrator had a lovely voice and some with clarity, however almost sounded too mature for the slang and colloquialisms used in the book - “how do you do fellow kids”. Main criticism of audiobook doesn’t relate to the content of the book itself. The book contains many lists - Do’s and Don’ts for example. The narrator would say Do, then list them all without repeating do at the front of each one, and the Don’t without repeating don’t in front of each one. In long lists it made the Don’ts sound like Do’s. A bit confusing at times."

In the first chapter, half of showing up for yourself is basically therapy, by which I mean lots of the info are things and skills I've learned in the last two years working with my therapist. I think considering therapy can be inaccessible or daunting for some, this is a good way to fill the gap. A huge strength of this book is its specificity. There are literal pages and pages of example sentences or scenarios to help demonstrate concepts. While I think there's a way you could write off the book as being simple platitudes or cliches repacked, there's a way in which the author takes those ""basic"" ideas like moving is good for you and setting boundaries but gives them a real treatment breaking it down to specifics. it shows how these simple things aren't as simple as they seem. I'm glad I bought this book because it feels like something I can return to in different stages of my life. "

The second half is really meaty with how to handle when your friends are going through a tough time or when you or your friend have messed up and need to make amends. It includes template conversations which I find really helpful for those tough conversations that I always feel like I'm saying the wrong thing. I tend to be a ""solution oriented"" person and this has lots of ideas for how to be more emotionally supportive instead. This is a lot of great stuff that's emotionally challenging and will take time to adopt. I borrowed this from the library but plan to buy a copy to keep referring back to. I imagine this is a book that will be helpful to re-read periodically."
118,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7019987-mel,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is about showing up in life, for yourself and others. It's about friendship and how to invest in them, but it could easily be about any relationship in your life (personal or professional) and how to grow them all.My key takeaways: Take care of yourself. Showing up for yourself is about understanding your needs in any given moment and being ok with not being ok. Listening more with others. I often try to relate through stories and it's something I need to work on more.There are great tips in this book for helping people be more empathetic. They don't necessarily call it out as such but that's what it is. If you're looking to hone your relatability skills, and be a better human, this book can help!It also mentions the kvetching circle which gets mad ups from me. More people should know and understand this concept. "
119,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"It has never taken me so long to finish a book that I loved this much. In part, it took me almost a year (!!!) because my friend and I actually did all of the exercises in the first part of the book. There were many. And while I can’t 100% remember what I learned from each, I do remember talking about each exercise and honestly feeling like I’d gained some true insight. And, if nothing else, I enjoyed being thoughtful about my relationship with myself and others. The time audit stands out to me as both particularly fun and really informative. My main takeaway from this book is that I’m very glad that I purchased it. The author provides wonderfully specific and thoughtful advice for countless difficult situations. I hope I don’t have to return the book, but I know that if/when I’m faced with a tough moment in a friendship, I have an incredible guide for navigating it."

There were also some practical tips for how to address uncomfortable situations with people in your social circles. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was that the book ended on kind of a bummer as the final topics were how to breakup with friends when you need to (but maybe that's just because I've been dealing with exactly that type of stuff for the last few months). I suppose I would have just preferred that the book end with one of the lighter topics. Being that this book can be read non-linearly I suppose I could have jumped around had I wanted to, but I'm a Start-to-Finish read as opposed to a Chapter-Hopper. Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to grow and treat themselves and the people they care about better."

This one's from 2020!While some of Miller's recommendations sound like common sense, I have struggled with what to say in enough of these situations and/or observed others handle such situations poorly to know that many folks would find at least some value in this book.Miller's diction is occasionally patronizing (e.g., at one point she advises readers not to ""bombard"" friends with text messages) and her recommendations are clearly written from the positionality of a middle-class woman who expects her readers to have mostly/all female-identifying friends and family members. I understand that the author was writing from her own experience, but wish more effort had been made to suggest recommendations applicable to more heterogeneous friend groups."

After nearly two months of no social activity, drinks with friends, or coffee with coworkers, this hit the spot. Many of us feel overwhelmed at what is expected of us, our overstuffed schedules, and keeping up. Using written techniques that helped me understand why I am the way I am helped me pinpoint happiness and how to be there for myself so that I can be there for others. I enjoyed and appreciated the prompts to answer questions by actually grabbing a pen and paper, and now I have pages of thoughts, favorite things, and ideas that are meaningful to me.It must feel defeating to publish a book in this Covid-19 world, and I think the lessons and thoughts in The Art of Showing Up will preservers!"

It was broken up into these two halves, respectively, and offered direct quotes and conversation starters for covering hard topics, which I found useful. I journaled alongside the first half of the book as recommended, and learned quite a lot about myself and what is important to me. I wish there was a bit more about how this then translates to friendships and the chemistry between friends, and how to relate to friends that are quite different from you. On the whole though, the book cut no corners and was straightforward and directly applicable to real life. I checked out a copy from the library, but it is a good book to own, mark-up and add to your self-help shelves."

The first part encourages showing up for yourself. This means self-care, but also getting to know yourself. Identifying your values, your likes and dislikes, your dealbreakers, your ideal ways of spending time alone and with others.The second part discusses how to be a good friend. Friendships add so much to our lives and I think many of us are underutilizing or under appreciating this value-add in favor of more urgent distractions depending on whatever life stage you are in. Scenarios are detailed, advice is given, and suggestions made on how to handle uncomfortable conversations.I got so much out of this!"

And Miller has a lot of good information in here about learning how to show up for yourself and why noticing is a super-power. But. She refers to the physical body as a meatstack multiple times and that is going to be the thing I remember forever about this book. It would be a great primer for someone who is a young adult and just starting out trying to navigate adult friendships, but no where is it advertised this way. So while I thought some of what she had to offer was valuable, overall I would only recommend it to someone who would actually use meatstack in the vernacular. Which is no one I know."

My main criticism is that she focused entirely on the negative - how to show up when things are bad. What about when things are good? I often have such difficulty navigating how to be a good friend even in good times, and that's the advice I was seeking but this book utterly failed to deliver. What a letdown.The first half seemed entirely unnecessary - oops, the book isn't long enough, how do I make it longer? I know, ""showing up for yourself"" AKA self-care and boundary-setting.

I wanted to hear a little more about her personal stories and struggles which she just touched upon lightly. One piece of advice? If you’re spiraling out, take twenty minutes and clean your bathroom.

In the Art of Showing Up, Rachel Wilkerson Miller takes the daunting task of authentically showing up for ourselves and others and breaks it down into bite-sized pieces. With actionable tips to improve a lot of areas in relationships, this book is more than a ""self-help guide"", it's a manifesto to help you be more intentional with the people that matter most if your life.

I read this on kindle, but plan to buy the physical book as a reference/tool...considering I took 32 (!!) pages of notes in my journal. Wow. This book should honestly be a class/workshop too — it provides ideas on how to communicate boundaries, how to break up with a friend, how to call friends out for fucking up, and how to apologize when you fuck up. Seriously, an amazing resource. Don’t go into this book expecting it to be full of research and studies. The tone is similar to a sisterly mentor — she swears, uses excessive exclamation marks, and is authentic. I really enjoyed the vibe, and it was a great break between heavier readings. The only issue I had was I didn’t agree with some of the confrontation tactics, but I think married with some NVC, you’ve got everything you need to start building healthy, high-quality relationships."

The author goes into a lot of details about everything to do with being there for yourself and for others. For example, what to do and say when a friend loses a pet. What to do or say when someone has had a miscarriage. How to care for yourself, in every way, physically, mentally, emotionally. A good book to have when you question if you're doing o.k. or whether others are doing o.k. Her style of writing is effortless. Her writing is very easy to read and understand. And you get a sense of who she is by the way she discloses some personal things about herself. It made her more human. And likeable. "

I did feel like it was a bit too long and I probably could’ve done without the first part about “showing up for yourself” it just wasn’t actionable enough for me. But the rest of the book was awesome and was useful advice about how to behave in friendships. I almost wish I would’ve bought this in actual book format because as lame as this sounds I feel like I would like to reference some of the ideas later. For example she talked about sending Venmos as sympathy cards instead of flowers which I really liked. I found the advice about ending friendships and resetting boundaries very very useful too!

You can expect to read about a lot of thoughtful strategies for handling life’s tough situations (that either you are going through or others are going through), including what to say and what to do.

That said, I wanted to read about showing up for OTHERS, and it turns out that the prelude to that is showing up for YOURSELF, which might be true - but not what I was particularly looking for advice on. This takes up a goodly part of the book, like a third or a half. Hence the lack of star rating. I can't tell if it's false advertising or my own resistance to self-improvement."
136,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"Interesting self-help concept with a two prong approach: inward and outward or how to focus on yourself and how you deal with others. The author was good to remind us that it's not always us either. It was written for a somewhat younger crowd, full of texting acronyms (some of which I needed to google). Admittedly this is an annoyance to me since when writing a book, you are not really trying to keep to a specific character limit.

I unfortunately did not realize that's what I was getting into with this one. To me, frequent cursing throughout takes away a good portion of authority and is distracting. I also thought it odd that some of her examples of neutral sayings included saying the f-word to the friend. Perhaps this is fine in her friend group, but I think many would think this very abrasive."

I liked the way she structured the book as well, that we must show up for ourselves before we do for others. I went into it wanting to be a better friend, but see I need to be a better friend to myself as well. I often ask myself, “how can I show up for myself here?” "

It's the perfect combo of self-care guide & how to be a good friend, but also colleague, family member, human. It covers things like personal values, boundary setting, how to be an ally, how to make new friends, maintain current relationships and how to have a friend break up. I've already gifted it to one person but I think I may be buying it for people for years to come."
150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42127118-nate-atkinson,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book is extensive and covers a lot of territory. I think this should be required reading for most men in our culture. It's very accessible and covers topics that everyone *should know*, but because men are taught to stop feeling their feelings at age 8, we lose out on learning so many skills and tools.Learning how to connect and show up for friends and loved ones is something that only makes your life more full and connected."
151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16374675-w-m,Rating 3 out of 5,"what are my thoughts on self-help ish books you ask? Honestly, I’ll never say no to one- I think that the benefit that comes from taking some time to reflect on yourself and your values is pretty darn helpful, regardless of how good or bad or cliche the book is. This one is basically a “how-to” guide for life and difficult conversations and I thought it served its purpose well. I could see myself flipping back through this to remind myself how to best support myself and the people I care about "
152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5128749-rhi,Rating 3 out of 5,"Enjoyed the subject matter and the way the author set up the book. Half was dedicated to how to show up for yourself and the other half was about showing up for other people (because you can't be there for others if you're not there for yourself). Loved that framing and the book had really specific examples of what to say and do in all those situations where we usually flounder, but I can't say I enjoyed reading it. Felt like it would be a better reference text vs a casual read."
153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105321661-olivia-carter,Rating 2 out of 5,"5/10 stars. I don’t know if I would recommend this book. While there were a few chapters that I felt were meaningful to me, a lot of the context seemed like common sense. I noticed myself wanting to get through some sections as quickly as possible to finish them. Reflecting on the entire book, however, there were definitely some key takeaways that I am looking forward to implementing and a good reminder to always stay curious in about life. "
154,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3702178-sarah-chambers,Rating 5 out of 5,"Very worth the read, and the purchase for me! I'll be keeping it on my bookshelf for practical advice as myself and my friends run into those tough times in life. When you're not quite sure how to show your support, what to say, or how to broach a tough conversation, this book has a list of places to start. Not only that, but it starts by encouraging you (and giving you ways) to show up for yourself so you can be a better, more reliable friend (something I'm very much working on). "
155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137431606-kenya-hairston,Rating 4 out of 5,"I started this book in a time in my life where I was struggling to show up for myself. I want to find “my person” but this book really broke down how I can be my own person. Giving myself grace, learning to make space for myself the same way I make space for others. As a person who values friendships so deeply I was also able to learn ways to better support my friends without taking away from my needs. Really it’s more of a 4.5 than 4. "

This quickly reminded me of American Girl’s “Smart Girls Guide to Friends” from 2008- which don’t get me wrong was great in it’s time. This got long, awfully specific, and will turn me away from the self help genre for a while. Great concept but definitely better conveyed in catchy articles than a book."
158,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/909353-abbie-graham,Rating 5 out of 5,"I was pleasantly surprised that the first half is dedicated to showing up for yourself. Miller really highlights (and underlines!) the importance of including yourself as one of the folks you're taking care of. She also provides activities, suggested scripts, and thoughtful ideas for being a good friend to yourself and others.I read this as an ebook from the library, but I'm planning to buy my own copy to have on hand."
159,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9802013-r,Rating 3 out of 5,"This was a fine message for young adults and I liked that it was an introspective look into relationships. Its not really about who you’ve known the longest or who’s been in your life the most, but its about maintaining relationships, about prioritizing who and what is important to you, but importantly also knowing your self-worth and what you are able to do, and ultimately being kind to yourself as a result."
160,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I learned so much and love how the book covered so many areas of life, not just one aspect like friendship, parenting, etc. The examples were real life and believable/realistic. I especially appreciate the author's commentary about discomfort, etc. and that you have to just move through it. And I especially love the style of writing. I feel like I just had a great, deep chat with a friend and mentor."

The first half was all about showing up for yourself (not others) and contained a lot of self help style exercises for self discovery. I felt like the prompts were actually pretty decent, but it just wasn’t what I was looking for.It was due back at the library before I got to the second half about showing up for others, and I’m not interested enough to finish it.

162,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/800757-amy-egbert,Rating 4 out of 5,"I found this guide to grown up friendships (and maybe kid ones too?) So so helpful. I'd like a few sheets of wallpaper with my favorite and most applicable scripts because these actual words are an awesome reference. It has lots of casual swearing (like talking to a teenager) which probably feels inappropriate to lots of people. For me, totally worth it to get to the gems of good practical advice. Also a simple direct guide to breaking up with friends."
163,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Good, practical advice. Something for everyone. The first part of the book focuses on self care, with real tangible actions on how to take care of yourself. The 2nd part deals with making and keeping friends. The 2nd part did not resonate with me. All the advice seemed pretty obvious but then I reflected on how I thought the first part was good and how that probably seems obvious for most ppl. "
164,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a nice companion for Big Friendship. It was very practical and concrete, and had some nice references to other relevant work (logically, considering the author's background). I wish there had been more in some parts and less in others, but this was a nice starting place for delving into literature on friendship."
165,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"A must-read for people who care deeply about strong relationships. I came at this book with a strong foundation in Rachel Miller's philosophy on friendship, and was already familiar with most of the other thinkers and practicioners she cites in the second half, showing up for others. The first half, showing up for oneself, was a newer set of habits for me, and was terrifically insightful."

This was somewhat bittersweet to read during the pandemic when gathering is not a thing we do. That said, this time has been important for reprioritizing many things in my life, and this was helpful. I’m always here for a framing of show up for yourself before you try to show up for others!"
167,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I really appreciated this book's examples and practicality. Rachel's voice is approachable and probably bordering on too ""trendy"" of terms, but it just covers the basics of how to treat yourself and your friendships well. Also, easy to reference what you're needing guidance on, as opposed to reading in chronological order."
168,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I found this more to be a 3.5/5. It was ok for me, a good casual easy read. It was filled with lots of helpful advice and tips though I found them most to be reminders rather than new information. I would however, recommend this for young adults who are new to navigating friendships/relationships & caring for themselves!"
169,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23976111-charlotte,Rating 3 out of 5,"Well written, very funny, and raises a lot of good questions. Admittedly, the last half was very hard to get through as I thought back on relationships I've been really hurt by, but it was good to work through those feelings a little bit more, versus repressing them, I guess. Very thankful for all the friends who has stuck by me through the years and who have helped me learn and grow."

While some of it was uncomfortable to read or implement, it was good because the discomfort meant it would push me to grow. It’s written conversationally and easy to digest. Recommend for anyone who wants to show up for themselves better and their friendships. "
171,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57324651-eva,Rating 4 out of 5,I'm fortunate to have a good friend who reminds me of Rachel Wilkerson Miller and has been practicing radical honesty with me since we first became friends. This book would be incredibly helpful for someone who doesn't have my friend in their life or who needs a brusher-upper. The parts about showing up for yourself are essential reading.
172,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I loved the first section of this book, which required a lot of self-reflection on what it means to show up for yourself. The latter parts of this book I wish I read a few years back when I was going through friend break-ups and hard moments within friendships -- I think it would have also gone further in showing me how to ""show up"" for friends -- despite this always being an opportunity for growth."
173,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3806401-emily,Rating 5 out of 5,"I did enjoy this book quite a bit— it contains some useful framework for deciding what and how you bring yourself to your friendships.

174,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/897536-molly,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book does not tell you what to do (physically) to be a good friend. I don’t know what I was expecting. 🤔 It also uses a lot of bad language. I don’t get that approach. It seems to be the thing right now. 🙄 I think this book would have been helpful in my 20s. By this point in my life, I have figured out most of what she said, myself. "
175,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104633493-sydney-levi,Rating 4 out of 5,"Really good content. Feels like you’re sitting down with the friend that knows all things to do well in social and professional settings. She then tells you like it is and gives really good advice. No matter how easy, hard or awkward the circumstance you’ll be able to navigate issues well. Sad that the unnecessary vulgar language takes away from the content. "
176,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22255292-katrina,Rating 3 out of 5,"Some great advice. I noticed that I do some of these things already, but being able to name, and bring your attention to those details is pretty powerful.

I borrowed this from the library, but I will be buying a copy so I can revisit Rachel's book when I need it most. I appreciated her thoughts on saying no to plans you don't want to do and the concept of deep-shallow relationships. I strong k y believe in the importance of that one person/relationship and the intimacy that stems from it."
179,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,This book was amazing it really teaches you about how you need to take care of yourself before you can worry about others and that without taking care of yourself first you never will be able to fully be their for others. She gives great advice. I would recommend reading and having a place to write things down so you can remember things later on. Overall I thought this book was really great 
180,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,This was an unusual read for me. I don’t usually read self-help books. When I realized it was one I almost set it down. I did finish it. I’m glad I did. There wasn’t a lot new in here (not that there would be). Its mainly good common sense advice. The author communicates well and doesn’t dwell on things too long. She keeps moving.

I have more to add but I need some processing time! "

So I wasn’t shocked when a lot of these things in the book were not new to me. However, I really appreciate feeling so seen because Rachel also hates “water chores” like showering and dishes. I also just really like her style and will happily read her write about anything."

I now feel a great deal more confident when it comes to making friends, communicating (especially tough conversations), and identifying personal boundaries. It's very well articulated, and acts as a good ""how to be a human who talks to other humans"" crash course. I'm excited to apply some of the concepts to my life."

Although I discovered some great ideas, I was never feeling like I really liked the book. I thought about buying it because I wanted to remember some of the ideas, but I just didn't like it well enough to buy it. I wasn't particularly interested in taking notes either."
186,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/802795-kris,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5 starsThis is not ground-breaking. It is, however, a good reminder of not only deciding what is important to you so that you can focus on surrounding yourself with people and activities that will support those things, but on the importance of focusing on yourself. It is crucial to show up for yourself so tha you will be able to show up for others. I needed to remember that. "
187,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3987427-roger,Rating 3 out of 5,"Good introduction to showing up for self and others. Will be particularly useful for people who struggle reading social situations and have a hard time figuring out what to say, since it has lots of scenarios and example scripts.

188,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18762169-donna,Rating 4 out of 5,"I don't read a lot of self help, but this one is something special; it takes the ""explain it to me like I'm a 5 year old"" approach to friendship which really made sense to me. I loved the many examples of how to communicate something even when things are (or you fear they are) awkward; I'm sure this stuff comes naturally to many people but for the rest of us, this book is helps."
189,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52436266-joseph-d,Rating 4 out of 5,I think this should be companion reading to anyone reading How To Win Friends and Influence People. This book talks about how to foster the various relationships we find ourselves in. It doors a great job at talking about the why to step out of our comfort zones and have those serious talks.

Some parts I truly cannot do (re confronting toxic people) since I'm anxious avoidant but yay for people who can!"
192,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,This was a very interesting read. It gave so many real world scenarios on ways to improve communication and respect boundaries. Sometimes I can get so stuck not being direct and clear and this was a reminder that normally that form of communication limits the most hurt. Also a very important reminder on how important all types of relationships are in our lives!!
193,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38975543-sarah-danielle-cooper,Rating 3 out of 5,"This turned out to be mostly self care and talking prompts for tackling different types of conversations. I agree with other reviewers that this might be best for teens and young women. I think if the author had woven in more of her life, or more anecdotes from friends, I would have felt more connected to the material and enjoyed it more. "
194,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90110075-majesta,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a really cute, witty book. The topic of being present and truly there for your friends and loved ones is especially important for the newer generations growing up in the highly technological world we now have."

306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14552661-samantha,Rating 4 out of 5,Really enjoyed - felt less like someone talking at me/telling me what to do and more of a conversation with a friend. Highly recommend the audio! There were part in the first section that felt very unnecessary but might apply to those just graduating high school or other young adults. I really liked the specific wording examples for different scenarios she gave as the hardest part is usually figuring out where to start a conversation/email/text. 
307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1957191-annie,Rating 4 out of 5,"Pick this up if you need a guide to healthy relationships and self care.

Perfect for young adults cause adult friendshipping is hard. "
308,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,I really liked this book. While it might seem simplistic… It really is good solid advice on how to be a good friend and be good to yourself. I thought she used too many cuss words… But that might be because of my age. I tagged a couple of the pages and will probably refer back to it when having challenges.

311,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7602210-thelastmango,Rating 5 out of 5,"really wish i had had this earlier on. lots of the tips/suggestions probably seem obvious, but only after reading it. lots of sentence starters and examples of how you can communicate, which was super helpful too. great for learning how to set boundaries/enforce them, be by yourself, make new friends, navigate friend relationships, and knowing what to say/do when things are hard (deaths, divorces, etc)"
312,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5152616-jill-dougher,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book is verrrry practical. Which is cool if you're looking for that sort of thing. I enjoyed the first few chapters of each section. Section one is about showing up for yourself and section 2 is about showing up for others. Miller sprinkles conversation starters for you try out that I didn't always agree with, especially the tone of voice. I think overall, I was expecting something different with this book so it wasn't really my cup of tea. BUT again, I can see how it would be helpful for someone who perhaps moved to a new city, or started a new job or who overall, wants to make new friends. If you feel good about your friendships and yourself, then you can give this one a pass. "

I've thought of a lot of people (friends, acquaintances, boyfriend etc.) while reading this and realized that I've lost so many opportunities to say the right thing for myself and for some of them, too... It's highly recommended especially those who don't know how to show up for themselves aka those who don't really know their boundaries."
314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31955415-andrea,Rating 4 out of 5,"The Art of Showing Up: How to be There for Yourself and Your People by Rachel Wilkerson Miller was an outstanding read. I checked it out from the library, but quickly realized I was finding so many good tips and ideas that I'm also going to purchase a copy for myself (Note: This will be from an indie bookstore!), so I can mark and return to all the good things that are throughout. Above all else what I loved about this was one was the intentionality of how it was structured. So often we jump to care and being there for others. This book starts with care for self. It doesn't just breeze through this either, rather it takes the time to ground everything in the individual. It works through this in a number of ways that are so helpful. The stuff for others is good, too, but I took so much for how it focused on me first. It also framed and offered considerations I haven't ever really given intentional space to considering and determining. As I read, I found myself nodding and reflecting and just loving so much of this one. I'm excited to own a copy of this, as I'm already ready to revisit and determine actionable steps!"

It was also a very inclusive read in terms of people with different life experiences and body abilities. I valued that. A lot of advice books seem to only made for one type of person, but this writer did her best to include every voice, and I valued that while reading. I think this book has a lot of power. I personally used it as a tool to work on my friendships, and also get to know who I am. I took her advice on keeping a journal while reading. I completed reading the book, but am going back to chapter 1 to answer the prompts on learning your own values and preferences. As an adult, I don't get asked these types of questions anymore, and the answers get lost in the mundane aspects of the day. I recommend this book to people looking both for a friend, and to be a better friend, and those who are looking to get to know their own self on a personal level. I will carry it in my days, a bit more aware than I was before reading."

Miller goes through everything from how to say no to being a bridesmaid to helping a friend who’s going through a divorce with practical, actionable tips and even scripts for how to approach a conversation. Miller mixes in enough expert tips to feel qualified with personal anecdotes to feel connected. It's a great book for young adults, people having difficulty making or keeping friends, or who just need a social tune up. Although I didn't love the chatty and sometimes effusive writing style, I did take a lot of this book to heart and will likely consult it often."
318,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I would divide this book into three sections: how to take care of yourself, how to meet your people, and how to take care of your people when they're going thru tough times. The best thing about it is how practical and honest it is. Part of it reads like Emily Post for real life: what to say when a friend who has a miscarriage or has an eating disorder or loses a pet. A perfect book for the socially awkward young adult in your life."
319,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/138217801-natalie-aldous,Rating 2 out of 5,This book was supposed to a good how too but honestly it was mostly just common sense. At first I found myself agreeing with everything and drinking the koolaid. But quickly I realized that most of this stuff I was agreeing with cause I already knew it and followed it. I wish I could say that this added a new perspective to things but I would be lying. So I give this book two starts cause yes what was said was true but I'm not sure I needed to read any of it. what does it add??
320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33291876-isabelle-nine-tale-vixen,Rating 4 out of 5,"A great resource, written with compassion and nuance; full of open-ended and nonjudgmental questions to define personal principles to guide future action. Obviously this won't have any effect if the reader doesn't invest the time, energy, and (where applicable) money to make changes in their life - but for those willing to do the work, this is a solid place to start."
