An interesting cyclical thing, sort of, given the flimsiness of what remains of Sappho's works. Also, I once had a writing teacher who said we should follow the ""Sappho rule"": every word of your writing should be so good that if there was a great flood or conflagration and only snippets of lines survived, there would still be great beauty and intensity in what was left. Kind of a tall order, but given the state of publishing today, I'd say it's needed now more than ever. "
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32804270-michael,Rating 5 out of 5,"Intimate, piercing, and incisive, Sappho's fragments are as enrapturing as they are reflective. The subjects of her lyrics range from musing about forbidden love to reveling in the passing of time. Paradoxically, the soft musicality of the poet's phrasing pairs extraordinarily well with the intensity of the emotions she describes in her lyrics: at once the fragments read as tender and visceral. Carson's edition makes for an ideal introduction to Sappho's work, as it clearly marks the many gaps in her extant verse. Whereas editions that don't format the fragments tend to transform Sappho into a kind of sparse Imagist, If Not, Winter forces readers to remember that most of the poet's work has in fact been lost or destroyed."

Sappho (c.630-c.570BCE), one of Ancient Greece’s Nine Lyric Poets, is an absolutely gorgeous poet and writer, one who’s been the subject of much academic discourse. Sappho was a complicated woman. Believed to have written 8 or 9 books, her lover Megara, daughter Kleis, and enemy Andromeda all appear within these texts. Through this translation, Anne Carson attempts to convey the best of her work, through both presentation—sometimes the spacing makes the poem, as with verse 26—and wording, as she discusses in her final notes of the book. For me, half the appeal of this edition was the work put into translation notes by Carson. Her insights on poem 137’s use of the extremely loaded term aidos (shame), and poem 142’s use of the term hetairai (friend) to connote an intimate relationship with a woman, each deepen the meaning of the poem. I also appreciated Carson’s commentary on 16, 55, 94, and 98. I particularly loved her choice to end on the brief verses, page after page of lines with no context beyond. Each line may be brief, but together they are infinite. Carson points out that Sappho associates desire with death, an idea that—interestingly enough—is also a function of queer theory in later times. Lee Edelman would, in his iconic 2004 book No Future, argue that because queerness cannot produce the patriarchal ideal of a Child, it is fundamentally defined by a drive towards death. Though I think this can easily become an oversimplification when applied to the ancient world, I couldn’t help but think of this when reading her poetry. If desire is death, what does it mean that through her poetry, her desire has kept her alive? There is something particularly powerful about a note in Anne Carson’s introduction, where she discusses the fact that much of our remaining knowledge of Sappho comes from references—other ancient artists quoting Sappho, discussing her works, creating poetry inspired by her. I wondered, reading this, what our future histories will look like: Which lines will survive? Which will not?A few of my highlights are listed below. ____(16) Some men say an army of horse and some say an army on foot and some men say an army of ships is the most beautiful thing on the black earth.

7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72975-marley,Rating 5 out of 5,"I took high-school Latin, as perhaps a couple of my recent reviews have mentioned. The first poem they ever had us translate in our AP Catullus/Horace class was Catullus' half-translation (""inspired by?"") of the second-most-complete Sappho lyric I think we have: Sappho 31. It's perfectly preserved as far as it goes, because it's in someone else's book and quoted in full in Greek, except that it very likely cuts off suddenly. As Carson translates the original, it begins ""He seems to me equal to gods,"" (I now paraphrase) that lucky man who is standing in front of you and getting to hear your sweet voice. It's every high school crush rolled into one, double-strength for adults. The awe there of a particular type of love from afar. And having your voice stopped up, just as the poem goes on to say. Really, it's the run into the third stanza, which came through just as overwhelming in my own half-proficient high school translation out of Latin when I was 17, that gives me shivers:for when I look at you, even a moment, no speakingis left in meno: tongue breaks and thinfire is racing under skinand in eyes no sight and drummingfills ears.(Nobody seems to be sure whether this stray last line was a mistaken addition in a later copy or whether the jerk of a grammarian we got it from decided to break off one line into another stanza--and Catullus' copy doesn't help either, because after some very gorgeous poetry, he breaks off somewhere ENTIRELY differently right at this point -- starts grumbling about how all this desire is probably just a sign he's got too lazy a schedule. That's the Roman in him, even though no other Roman appreciated Sappho like Catullus did--all his love poems are to ""Lesbia,"" after Sappho's homeland, which had at the time more sensual and artistic than solely homoerotic connotations.) The PointAnyway, this is a long, nerdy, Goodreadsy introduction, but there's a reason: a poem nearly 2,600 years old, not even in its original language, not even in its entirety, and originally written as a song but with the music lost aeons ago (one wonders whether this is what will happen to Bob Dylan one far-away day)--what I am saying to you is: all these qualifiers, all this in between us and the original impact, and me bored in high school, and it still knocked me flat on my ass.And now you realize there is only one other poem in better shape (from a book of her work as late as the 8th century, which KILLS me that she survived in good shape over 1,000 years but couldn't last more), and every single other one in existence is in pieces--some still getting you most of a through-line, others just one or two or three words. Shattering.And of course, this is exactly what Carson plays up, translating every tiny snowflake of parchment we've ever been able to trace to Sappho, every time some stodgy grammarian or hokey philosopher quotes half a line to keep his audience from falling asleep--and showing you as best she can how much is lost, and how much you can tell through this incredibly hazy lens how fantastic a poet she clearly was.And I'm getting frustrated, because this input form has eaten half my review twice already (starting to feel like our subject, here), but I'm going to lay out what this means if it kills me:The way Carson shows you the gaps are with the power of ASCII art: brackets, brackets everywhere. Left hand page is always the Greek, laid out in the SHAPE of what remains, brackets to show the yawning gaps in the ripped or torn or blotted parchment, and to show the little interpolations that remain. Right hand page is her English--still using brackets, but gesturally, to give you a sense of the ""papyrological event,"" as Carson says in her introduction--and desperately trying to translate only the words that remain, to show you that lack that is also need that is also desire.How else to behold:]noble]taking]sing to usthe one with violets in her lap]mostly]goes astrayand realize even those few words come from two full stanzas we will never see, and not go as silent as the lover in that first poem I mentioned, trying to grapple with the passion for life that still blazes out of this gorgeous, tragic confetti?"
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5114433-liz-janet,Rating 4 out of 5,"""Someone will remember usI sayeven in another time""Sappho was an ancient Greek poetess from the island of Lesbos, but little is known of her life, with mostly fragments of her work surviving, which are often not taken as biography. So little of her works survives, that it is known she was exiled from Lesbos after the rise of Pittacus, but very little of her political standing has been discovered. “yet if you had a desire for good or beautiful thingsand your tongue were not concocting some evil to sayshame would not hold down your eyesbut rather you would speak about what is just” Sappho wrote with wit and sharpness, but so soft and beautiful, that I would love to listen to her fragments being sung, they create a space of peace within me. It makes me happy. “Evening you gather backall that dazzling dawn has put asunder:you gather a lamb, gather a kid,gather a child to its mother.” It is to say, that a poem written 2 millennial ago, by an ancient woman, not to my eyes in its native tongue, and not even in its entirety, still survives and is widely read, loved, admired, and studied, is to show the magnificence of the author."

Questing, reading, marvelling – so we search on,Poets seeking answers to questions all lostLovers ask. Your answers still reach us, drenched, fresh      From the Aegean.A LIFE IN FRAGMENTSTowards the end of the second century AD, in the last flickering light of classical Greece, a philosopher called Maximus, in a city on the Levantine coast, wrote a grammatical textbook about figures of speech. Casting around in old books for examples of how poets have described love, he writes: ‘Diotima says that Love flourishes when he has abundance but dies when he is in need: Sappho combined these ideas and called Love bitter-sweet and “ἀλγεσίδωρον”.’So we have this one word that Sappho wrote, some eight centuries before Maximus was born. This is what we mean when we talk about her poetry existing in ‘fragments’. The Canadian poet Anne Carson translates this example as:171paingiverVery often these remnants are quoted with no regard to any poetic quality, but rather in illustration of some grammatical point. Apollonius Dyscolus, for instance, writing again some time in the 100s AD, included a throwaway remark on variant dialects during an essay on pronouns. ‘The Aeolians,’ he said, ‘spell ὅς [‘his, hers, its’] with digamma in all cases and genders, as in Sappho's τὸν ϝὸν παῖδα κάλει.’ Again Carson's translation gives us just the phrase in question:164she summons her sonCarson's translation of Sappho's oeuvre is well subtitled ‘Fragments of Sappho’, since most of what's left is of this nature. It's certainly nice to have everything collected in this way in English, though it must be admitted that her book sometimes seems more an exercise in completionism than in poetic expression. That said, as other reviewers have pointed out, reading pages and pages of these deracinated terms (‘holder…crossable…I might go…downrushing’) can succeed in generating a certain hypnotic, Zen-like appeal.Nevertheless, such things lose a lot by being read in isolation; the as it were archaeological pleasure of digging them out of their original context, in works of grammar or rhetoric, is completely absent. For that, the Loeb edition translated by David A. Campbell is far preferable, for all that he has no pretensions to being a poet, just because you get Sappho delivered in that context of other writers. The fonts used for the Greek are also much more readable in the Loeb. (The Carson edition does include the original Greek, and points for that – though there are some strange editorial…choices? mistakes? – such as printing ς for σ in all positions.)MUSIC AND LYRICSTo the Ancient Greeks, Homer was simply ‘The Poet’ – and ‘The Poetess’ was Sappho. She was held in extraordinarily high esteem, which makes it the more frustrating that so much of her has been lost: ninety-nine percent, according to some experts. Only one or two poems remain that can be said to be more or less complete.Her poetry is mainly ‘lyric’, that is, designed to be sung while strumming along on the lyre. Sappho was, in modern terms, a singer-songwriter; she was known to be an extremely talented musician, designing a new kind of lyre and perhaps even inventing the plectrum. When we read her poetry now, we have to remember that we're looking at something like a shredded collection of Bob Dylan or Georges Brassens lyrics, with no idea of how their meaning would have interacted with the music.But however important the lost melodies, we do know that she was revered for the beauty of her phrasing. This is something translators struggle with. Fragment 146, a proverb about not wanting to take the bad with the good, is rendered literally by Campbell as ‘I want neither the honey nor the bee’ and by Carson, ‘Neither for me honey nor the honey bee’ – which is better, but consider the alliterative dazzle of the original:μήτε μοι μέλι μήτε μέλισσα(mēte moi meli mēte melissa)Reading the Greek, even if you don't understand what any of the words mean, will often get you halfway there with Sappho. Say it out loud and you'll get a tingle, as it starts to dawn on you what all the fuss might have been about.But the rest of the job has to be done by translators. The Loeb edition will not help you here: its prose translations are only a crib to help you study the original. Carson's approach is slightly conflicted. She quotes approvingly a well-known statement from Walter Benjamin to the effect that a translation should ‘find that intended effect…which produces in it the echo of the original’, i.e. that one should translate ideas and feelings rather than words. But she also claims to be trying to use ‘where possible the same order of words and thoughts as Sappho did’, which is the sort of thing that makes me instantly suspicious.Here's her version of Fragment 2, which is one of the more complete poems we have, scratched on to a broken piece of pottery which has miraculously survived from the second century AD. The first stanza (an invocation to Aphrodite) is probably missing, but the next two run like this:]here to me from Krete to this holy templewhere is your graceful groveof apple trees and altars smoking      with frankincense.And it in cold water makes a clear sound throughapple branches and with roses the whole placeis shadowed and down from radiant-shaking leaves     ��sleep comes dropping.This is not bad. I think the word order is unnecessarily foreign at times, but it does sound good and Carson even includes a few of Sappho's famous hendecasyllabic lines – though they are not true ‘Sapphic’ verses, a very strict form which is not well adapted to English (as you may be able to tell from my attempt at the top of this review).Aaron Poochigian, in a selected edition for Penguin Classics, takes a different approach. ‘Sappho did not compose free verse,’ he chides, perhaps with one eye on Carson, ‘and free-verse translations, however faithful they may be to her words, betray her poems by their very nature.’ Poochigian's version of the stanzas above goes like this:Leave Crete and sweep to this blest templeWhere apple-orchard's eleganceIs yours, and smouldering altars, ampleFrankincense.Here under boughs a bracing springPercolates, roses without numberUmber the earth and, rustling,The leaves drip slumber.I think that's pretty great. It takes much more liberties with Sappho's actual words but, to the extent that it produces a sensual thrill in English, it more faithfully reproduces the effect that Sappho had on her original audience. At least, to me it does. Poochigian's selection, called Stung with Love, is much shorter than the other two I read, but a very good encapsulation of her qualities. It also has by far the best introduction, a brilliant essay which puts Sappho in her context extremely well. And because it's the most recently published, it's also able to include the magic new Sappho poem discovered in 2013, written on a scrap of papyrus used to stuff a mummy.BIGGER THAN A BIG MAN‘Someone will remember us / I say / even in another time.’ Another fragment. The irony of this one upset me at first, because she should have survived in far greater quantities than she did. But even so, the thrill of hearing the voice of a woman who lived six centuries before Christ was enough to catch my breath over and over again. Generally speaking, women in antiquity are pretty silent. But Sappho isn't, and her influence, despite the meagre remains we have, is ginormous.It might sound hyperbolic to claim that all modern love poetry is inherited from Sappho, but in fact there's a very real sense in which that's true – so great was her reputation among Classical writers and the Europeans who, in turn, studied them, that it's quite possible to trace a direct line from Sappho, through Catullus, to the Romantic poets and from them to contemporary pop lyrics. Every song about the pain of unrequited love owes something to Sappho's Fragment 31, for example – ideas now so clichéd that we forget they have an ancestry at all. That's just natural, surely – just the way people speak? But no, it isn't natural, it's Sappho. She's part of our inheritance, part of our language. She's under our tongue."

A therapist’s dream, if you would.Carson’s introduction gives some much needed context in order to understand the exact format of this book:“Sappho was also a poet. There is a fifth century hydria in the National Museum of Athens that depicts Sappho, identified by name, reading from a papyrus. This is an ideal image; whether or not she herself was literate is unknown. But it seems likely that the words to her songs were written down during or soon after her lifetime and existed on papyrus rolls by the end of the fifth century B.C. On a papyrus roll the text is written in columns, without word division, punctuation or lineation. To read such a text is hard even when it comes to us in its entirety and most papyri don’t. Of the nine books of lyrics that Sappho is said to have composed, one poem has survived complete. All the rest are fragments.”Carson uses square brackets to indicate “destroyed papyrus or the presence of letters not quite legible somewhere in the line”, which really gives the whole series of fragments immense context. The projections I discuss come in with the blank spaces - those are the places where we let our imaginations run wild. Check out this fragment, number 26:		]frequently ]for thoseI treat well are the ones who most of all ]harm me	 ]crazy	 ]	 ]	 ]	 ]you, I want	 ]to suffer ]in myself I amaware of this]]]It doesn’t take a genius to fill in the gaps and grasp the emotion the original was attempting to convey. I wish I could type out the proper spacing that Carson used here, but Goodreads isn't cooperating with the formatting.

24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,Rating 5 out of 5,"This marvelous collection of the extant fragments of verse attributed to Sappho is a glorious spur to the imagination. Sappho was a lyricist, a poet, a musician. It is unknown whether or not she was literate in reading and writing, but her work was collected in writing, and reprinted, but little has survived the centuries. Only one full poem, the ode to Aphrodite, survives whole at twenty-eight lines. Sappho was known and lauded throughout the ancient world for the beauty of her poems accompanied by the lyre. She wrote nuptial songs mainly, it seems, for the tenor of the fragments suggest the happy circumstance of a marriage. The Encyclopedia Britannica suggests that Sappho taught young women the arts of courtesanship, seduction, marriage which may (I speculate here) be one reason why she was so universally adored and admired. Can we all agree that to be a brilliant courtesan requires great intelligence: a deep understanding and acceptance of human nature and desire, and enormous self-control and discipline? Add to this her apparently unparalleled skill as a poet—alas! We do not have enough of her work surviving to adequately judge, but the fragments set us to dreaming and are an undeniable spur to writers and lyricists alike. We will have to trust her contemporaries and sup upon lines like 
Eros shook my mind like a mountain wind falling on oak trees

If many of the song or poem fragments were composed for weddings, just that concept brings a host of associations and an understanding of Sappho’s history. There is more to learn about her as an individual (she had three brothers, was married with a child, was exiled to Sicily in her twenties it is thought) but not much more. It is thought she lived from 610 B.C. to 570 B.C. A collection of her work was published during the Middle Ages in nine volumes but has not survived. Our imagination will have to suffice. That the work of an individual has so inflamed the public imagination for such a long time is cause enough for wonder. One fragment shows an awareness of her fame
someone will remember us I say																 even in another time
 Sappho was a “honeyvoiced…mythweaver,” 
]nectar poured from gold ]with hands Persuasion
The surviving fragments are a kind of spur to the creative mind. When writers or lyricists find themselves stuck, they could do much worse than flip through this book for its inspiration. To my mind Sappho addresses writer's block: 
for it is not right in a house of the Musesthat there be a lamentthis would not become us
 Apologies to Anne Carson and publisher AA Knopf for not being able to reproduce the high quality typesetting and lovely spacing in this book. If this review is at all intriguing to you, try to lay your hands on a printed copy from 2002. The formatting is as informative as the print. Also, I put pictures in my blogpost."
25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137211804-npc,Rating 2 out of 5,Not sure if I love Sappho despite the fact that we only have fragments of her poems or because we only have fragments of her poems and that makes her ~~mysterious~~. It's probably a combination of both. My rating is for Carson's translation. I found her voice intrusive and it kept calling attention to the language in a way that seems more like a late 20th century poet than how I imagine Sappho sounded to her original audience. Disclaimer: I don't speak Ancient Greek so I could be totally wrong! Also I'm biased because I had read the Mary Barnard translation (Sappho) before and adored it.

Anne Carson’s method, using brackets to indicate where the lost bits would have been, and thus providing space for them, in her words: “brackets imply a free space of imaginal adventure” creates a kind of continuity and connectivity to the work. Providing reverberations to what would have been whole.The poems themselves are a celebration of life and love. They are rapturous, sensual, and lyrical. When one takes a step back and beholds the whole tapestry: Sappho herself and the splendour of these wonderful fragments of poetry, all that it has survived, the work through the ages to preserve, Carson’s brilliant translation, it’s hard not to be awed.

The translations of he poems were mostly well done, but the poems that were longer than two lines lacked the flow and imagery of other translations (which are things I love about Sappho's writing, so the absence was disappointing). My biggest quarry with this book is the erasure of the fact that Sappho is and was a lesbian. Since these translations were released in 2003, I understand where the setback was, but that is a trademark of beautiful Sappho and honourable to sapphics of aeons. The poems where she talks about being in love with women etc are not in this book, or if they are every gender identifying factor was changed from female to male. That's the utmost disrespect and dirt on her name. I can't say I hold this book in high esteem."

I noticed similarites, and dare I say I prefer his translation? I plan on rereading his collection to compare.Here's an example of a Willis Barnstone translation I prefer (just my preference) Anne Carson:  I would not think to touch the sky with two armsWillis Barnstone: I could not hopeto touch the sky with my two armsBarnstone's choice of words: 'I could not hope to touch the sky with my two arms' simply resonates with me more than Carson's translation.This is an excellent translation, but I understand the criticisms Anne Carson has received. I don't mind translations that take liberties, and believe it's better to keep the spirit of the text vs staying true to the exact words and syntax. (Side note: This is why I'm not a fan of the Russian translators P&V...) I'm looking forward to reading Aaron Poochigan and Diane Rayor's translations next."
32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49814522-lucy,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 starsIn her introduction, Anne Carson cites W. Benjamin in their analysis of translation as a process. Benjamin states that “The task of the translator consists in finding that intended effect upon the language into which he is translating which produces in it the echo of the original”. I felt that Carson undertook this aim beautifully. Reading this collection, I could hear a faint echo of Sappho’s voice, or at least I could sense the emotion and heart that went into her writing.With these fragments, Carson encourages us to linger on individual words, feel their shape, repeat them in our mind until we become immersed in their meaning. To appreciate this poetry is to open ourselves to the emotions and the experiences Sappho is sharing. It is strange to think we are perusing the thoughts of someone who is thousands of years away from us, but with these fragments we can build a connection. As Sappho writes, “someone will remember us | I say | even in another time”. We remember Sappho, and with this collection, we can see her. "

Anne Carson's very brief, graceful introduction hints at the difficulty of best arranging that little to get the most from it - the most excitement (""brackets are exciting""), the maximum number of delicious shivers... The Greek is on the left page, translation on the right, with lacunae marked where appropriate in both. Carson uses the clearest language possible, and adorns the text with minimal punctuation.Carson has given us a poet's translation that feels as fresh and immediate as cold water, yet somehow carries to us the thrill of reading an ancient text, an incomplete text, a distant music sometimes caught and sometimes lost. Her work here is exquisite, I think. Reader: don't skip the intro, and don't neglect to read the notes. Carson says nothing unless she has something worth saying.As for Sappho... well... nothing I say will do her justiceSome men say an army of horse and some men say an army on foot and some men say an army of ships is the most beautiful thing on the black earth.

I am neither a Greek scholar nor have I read Sappho previously, so maybe this was the wrong place to start. There were definitely some good fragments in the book, but a lot of the time I was having an emperor's-new-clothes experience. For example, one page has the fragment:sinfulAnother page says - ]]all]but different]hair]The ]s represent places in the original Sappho where the papyrus is destroyed or illegible. There are fuller pages than these, and many of the poems and fragments are supplemented by end notes, which are in part explanatory.I do like the frequent violets, and the ""dripping (pain)"" but give me Emily Dickinson any day. I think the most exciting moment of reading this book was when it dawned on me that the title of JD Salinger's ""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters"" is a line from a Sappho poem. "
37,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/89588648-old-dog-diogenes,Rating 3 out of 5,"Upon finishing this collection, I read through some of the reviews left by my GR friends, and I came across my friend Mark's review, and he articulated a few things that I was in complete agreeance about concerning the difficulty of interpretation when it comes to Sappho because of the lack of objectivity surrounding both her work and her life. Here are some of my thoughts in line with what he said:What is it about Sappho that is so attractive to so many modern readers? There is a modern fascination with her that is historically unprecedented. Are modern readers equally as fascinated by the rest of the Greek poets? The Homeric Hymns or the Odes of Pinar of Thebes? Do they read Sappho's only complete poem, ""Ode to Aphrodite"" in it's entirety and long for the rest of the fragments of her poetry to be complete, to better understand her contextually? I know that some readers do, but it appears to be the minority. It seems more likely to me that modern readers enjoy Sappho most, primarily because they are not actually reading Sappho, but only a ghost of Sappho that has been constructed with the help of a modern translation to read very much like post-modern poetry. The fragmented nature of Sappho arouses the post-modern inclination toward subjectivity, and the lack of historical and biographical information concerning Sappho releases us from the contextual understanding so that we are free from the chains of objectivity when deciphering her poetry's meaning. She becomes in essence whatever we desire her to be. Which is hilariously incongruous because she is then often objectified by the very people who supposedly despise the objectification of women. She is touted to be a LGTBQ+ hero, a proto-feminist, a herald of the post-modern age, yet isn't all of that a bit silly? Calling her a lesbian makes sense, but only in the sense that she was from Lesbos. The idea that she was living against the norm by engaging in sexual relations with both men and women (whether or not that was actually the case) is preposterous, and displays a certain level of ignorance concerning the Greeks in general. She was a Greek from Lesbos that sadly we know very little about. Her poetry when referenced by other Greeks such as Aristotle, or Herodotus is usually praised for it's immaculate craftsmanship. Yet the Sappho they are referring to is not entirely the same one that we are reading today. The Sappho that we are reading today has been turned into a modern play-thing that fortifies a post-modern perspective, and I am quite skeptical of this tendency to edit/skew history to have it back-up a certain perspective. I wonder if we had her poetry in it's entirety if she would be as widely read as she is today, and I honestly doubt that she would be because it wouldn't pander to postmodernist liberalism in the same way that it does in it's current form. According to John Tzetzes of the 12th century ""the passage of time has destroyed Sappho and her works"". So, historically speaking it seems that lack of interest in her poetry was the primary reason that her works were lost to time, due to a few different factors, one being that her dialect was odd for the people who encountered her works throughout history who were more accustomed to a more ""classic"" dialect, alongside I imagine a lack of content that resonated with historic readers. Now with all of that out of the way, I should say that I enjoyed these fragments for what they were, and I am glad that they exist, even with all of the missing pieces and holes in the narrative. I just think that we should approach Sappho and the fragments with a degree of caution, as to not perpetuate the tendency to make her into something she was not.

I know nothing about Ancient Greece and am not a classicist, but that said, there are some poems that I recognized here and enjoyed more when it came from a different translator.

62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147203-maggie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Anne Carson, poet and Classicist, presents all we have of Sappho in the original Greek and in English translation. Carson indicates with brackets where the papyrus has simply fallen apart or is incomprehensible, which gives a curious flow to most of the fragments. When I read this, I heard some of the lines with pauses; some of the lines overlapped as if multiple voices were speaking, breaking in and over the voice before it.As you sift through chance lines, half-expressed thoughts, you begin to wonder and compose in your head. What sort of dripping cloth? Is it a tear-soaked handkerchief? Is is a bloodied gown? Whose eyes? Why would she not think to touch the sky with two arms? And as you're musing, you're suddenly rewarded (as if poetic contemplation was not reward enough) with whole chunks of poetry, full finished lines and thoughts. The rhythm, which I cannot express in the expected vocabulary of meter, resonated (I hate this word, but nothing else suffices) like all the best lines I've ever read - be it by Tiptree, Szymborksa, or Fitzgerald. These are phrases that I understand, but cannot articulate why. These are ideas that will sit with me and then suddenly pop up years later.And with the turn of a page you're back to the laundry lists of adjectives and nouns, the scraps and pieces that you start again to fit together into something... anything. I could imagine another great poetry project in which the poet tried to incorporate into individual poems some of these phrases or adjectives left behind.Carson's notes are interesting too, even if you're like me and lack any real Classical learning. How this woman manages to dance between Sappho and Emily Dickinson, and Julian, and George Eliot, and Gertrude Stein is beyond my comprehension, but it all works beautifully.That it really - it's beautiful."

Nothing is filled in. So you scan through lots of oddball scraps, and suddenly get very excited when a complete sentence shows up, or even a stanza!There isn't much left of Sappho, The Poetess of Ancient Greece. Her nine books are lost and only handful of lengthy sections of poems exist - maybe two are complete. All we have is a reputation and a very many tantalizing fragments quoted or found here and there. Carson claims she finds the gaps exciting, as we can imagine our own various completions. She has put together a beautiful book, one for reflection as we look at a page of two incomplete lines and can spend some time, if we like, pondering them. As they are the only thing on the page, we might just do that, and then do it again on the next. Or you might find yourself trying to learn some Greek by finding the reoccurring words, or other such nonsense tasks. I really really like that this book exists. I can't, however, say that I truly got anything useful from reading it. And, if I did, couldn't possibly tell you what that was. "

In their spaces, incompleteness, and briefness lie the beauty of a thousand interpretations and perceptions. Indeed, it's quite a waste to think that most of her works are lost forever and that we must rely on our imagination in envisioning this stunning arrangement of words (""sweetworded desires"", ""goldsandaled Dawn"", ""piercing breezes"") sung accompanied by the gentleness of the lyre — wooing, proclaiming, praising. Other than Sappho's indubitable genius as a poet, Anne Carson's translation is not to be missed. Each ""]"" that designates parts of a papyrus indecipherable / destroyed hints of a much grandeur whole. All is felt and guessed. Moreover, Carson's section for Notes provides fascinating insight on some of her literary decisions regarding the translation, some points theorise for what / for whom perhaps a certain fragment is for. I also marvelled on some of the influences included. ""I don't know what to dotwo states of mind in me""— FRAGMENT 51""you came and I was crazy for youand you cooled my mind that burned with longing""— FRAGMENT 48Throughout the course of reading this, I tend to forget what's missing due to their sheer brilliance alone (""mingled with all kinds of colors"", ""both you and my servant Eros"", ""may you sleep on the breast of your delicate friend""). I'd like to think the lost / destroyed papyri have been sieved; a matrimony with the earth. Oh how much more in their wholeness? Currently, this book is resting on my bed and I sleep beside it. All these nights I leaf through it, more so when sleep would not come, comforting myself with pictures they form in my head; an intimate commune I built for Sappho and me. What an experience."

Hay que empezar a atrevernos a trascender las meras lecturas desde la política identitaria para redefinir nuestra identidad, en otros términos, en otros lugares.

Hay un mundo sáfico que apenas estamos vislumbrando y está traducción/ re-creación/ resurrección nos da pautas para poder no reapropiarlo sino para poder volver a vivir en el, porque el legado de Safo es nuestro como es nuestro el amor que construyo en las mujeres para las mujeres. Si no el invierno, es parte de esa selección de las grandes épicas femeninas, por que existen, son varías y necesitamos conocerlas. Carson traduce los fragmentos que quedaron del trabajo de Safo pero también se da tiempo de experimentar, nos propone un juego, nos dice: aquí faltan pedazos, pon lo que tu quieras poner ahí.

The first time I read Sappho was through Mary Barnard’s translation, which I did enjoy, yet it felt like there was something missing. The fact that this edition presents the original Greek poem on the facing page, with the verses written as if on a ragged scrap of papyrus, makes the experience more intimate and profound. Brackets and spaces give you a sense of what is absent, allowing you to ponder what the words might have been or even simply basking in the silence of those white empty spaces.Carson says of her method of translation: ‘I like to think that, the more I stand out of the way, the more Sappho shows through.’ In fact, the fragments, despite their broken lines and missing words, are still emotionally impactful, if not even more so. Maybe you might not be able to hear the music, but you might still hear an echo from the past."

72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2650868-leah-rachel-von-essen,Rating 4 out of 5,"Much of what we know of Sappho's poetry is actually inaccurate. Poets over centuries have filled in, guessed, and translated, but the truth is that Sappho is one of the most iconic poets of antiquity—quoted and referenced by Plutarch, Galen, Aristotle—as well as a queer woman legend, but all we actually have of her poetry is in tattered, halting fragments or quoted excerpts. Here, Anne Carson takes a stab at translating these excerpts, using open brackets to show the reader where lines are missing, giving us a glimpse into the reality of Sappho's verses.I admit I feel lied to! The complete poems of Sappho's I've read are ones with much of the verse filled in or with added context. This was a fascinating look into the truth. Sappho's yearning, evocations of Aphrodite, and discussion of soft throats, bundles of violets, and music are gorgeous and hint at the poetic genius we might have known. She wrote nine books of poetry, but this is all we have, and there's a true tragedy in that (my little bookworm heart wonders whether the Library of Alexandria had copies!)To be honest...I found this volume difficult at times. First of all, my readability pet peeve: footnotes instead of endnotes, PLEASE. The flipping back and forth makes putting the pieces together a lot harder! But rising past my qualms about end notes...they weren't that well done. Included were: comparisons between Sappho and more modern poetry (fun but unnecessary), notes that punted you on to later notes (aren't you supposed to give the explanation at the earliest reference, not latest?), notes that were frustratingly brief and required Wikipedia follow-ups, notes that were so specific they weren't actually useful, and technical notes about where each fragment was found or discovered.Her translation could be opaque at times, and the end notes didn't give any help (someone explain the uninterrupted line ""the blamer may winds and terrors / carry him off"" to me). At times a translation may have been accurate, but the meaning wasn't clear, and the notes didn't help. Some verses could have used some literary analysis from someone who knows more about Sappho than the average reader, but only a few had that. For some of Sappho's most iconic verses, I would have loved some insight into the translation choices Carson made. And sometimes I wondered if Carson failed to make a leap in her insights (ex. might the mysterious use of ""courtesan"" to describe female friends mean something closer to ""lover""?)Overall, I loved Sappho, and this presentation—but wonder if Carson's translation work was let down by the book's execution and the work of the end notes."
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29406296,Rating 5 out of 5,"When the notes are worth reading, you know you have something quite special on your hands. 98a.3 “ornament” or “good order” ( kosmos = English “cosmos”): a word that implies all sorts of order, from the arrangement of planets in the sky at night to the style with which an individual wears her hat. In the language of politics, kosmos means the constitution or good government of a city. In the language of cosmology, kosmos means the entire, perfect, ordered universe. According to one ancient cosmology, cosmos was first assembled out of chaos, when Zeus threw a veil over the head of the goddess of the underworld, Chthonie, and married her. So Pherekydes tells us, and he goes on to describe the veil, on which were embroidered earth, ocean and the houses of ocean—that is to say, the contours of the civilized world. Once veiled by her bridegroom, the dark and formless chthonic goddess was transformed and renamed Ge, goddess of the visible world, decorous and productive wife of Zeus (Pherekydes frr. 50-4 Diels). Pherekydes and Sappho are both drawing upon a vestiary code that regulates female decency in the ancient world. The head is its focus. Headgear is crucial to female honor, an index of sexual purity and civilized status. No decent woman should be seen in public wihout her headdress; only prostitutes and maenads run about unveiled. When Sappho regrets she cannot cover her daughter's head properly she is recording a personal chaos that extends from the boundaries of the body to the edge of civility—the edge where it all leaks away. See also fr. 81b (above) where Sappho says the Graces despise a woman whose head is without a crown. We might note in passing that the most common Greek word for what veils a female head is kredemnon , whose symbolic force can be read from its threefold usage. Properly signifying a woman's “headbinder,” kredemnon is also used to mean “battlements of a city” and “stopper of a bottle.” It is plain what these three have in common. A corked bottle, a fortified city, a veiled woman are vessels sealed against dirt and loss. To put the lid on certifies purity.I hadn't read anything by Sappho before, and was so pleasantly surprised that 2500+ years isn't enough to separate a person from another person.

77,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2326585-jason-gignac,Rating 5 out of 5,"(Original Review)This is the sort of book that strikes me cleverness dumb. So I will simply begin by telling you what the book is.If Not, Winter is a collection of all of the known works of Sappho - almost entirely fragments. Sappho was, in ancient Greece, considered one of the two greatest lyric poets, alongside Pindar. However, probably in part because she was a woman and in part because she appears to have been bisexual (her home was Lesbos, and the words lesbian and sapphic come from her), only one complete poem of hers survives, and then a series of fragments. The book, then, is a collection of those fragments, some salvaged bits of papyrus, some quotes (sometimes just a quoted word) from her contemporaries.Of all the books I've ever read, as a physical book, this is probably the number one most beautiful, in terms of words, I've ever seen. The concept and layout is beautiful, sparse, and extremely powerful - it is a book that proves that books themselves are still pertinent and meaningful. The beautiful thing is, without the layout, honestly, most of these fragments would feel meaningless and orphaned. The way the fragments are presented conveys the feeling of loss, the frustration of something we can never have in ways that description cannot. Fragment 107 is a good example. Each fragment is composed of facing pages, the left in Ancient Greek, the right an English translation. Fragment 107 is an empty, white page, with 107 on the top, and simply the fragmented sentence:""do I still yearn for my virginity?""Similarly 126 just reads:""may you sleep on the breast of your delicate friend""Sometimes there is more, as in 104, where there is enough to get a fleeting echo of a voice in it:104AEveningyou gather backall that dazzling dawn has put asunder:you gather a lambyou gather a kidyou gather a child to its mother104Bof all stars the most beautifulOf course, in isolation like this, that seems silly. But it isn't! I saw a review that likened it to trying to hear a poorly tuned radio station. To me, it's more like sitting outside of a concert, slowly realizing that they're playing something beautiful, and then having the concert end before you can get in the door. Ther are lines, sometimes:138: stand to face me belovedand open out the grace of your eyessometimes, there is even enough to catch the gist of a tune:94:I simply want to be dead.Weeping she left mewith many tears and said this:Oh how badly things have turned out for us.Sappho, I swear, against my will I leave you.And I answered her:Rejoice, go andremember me. For you know how we cherished you.But if not, I wantto remind you] and beautiful times we had.For many crowns of violetsand roses] at my side you put onand many woven garlandsmade of flowersaround your soft throat.And the brackets! I ahve never had a relationship with a piece of punctuation like I've now developed with the square bracket, which signifies, in the text, a lost block of text, illegible or destroyed:] heart] absolutely] I can]] would be for me] to shine in answer] face]] having been stained]And so it is, the entire book. Whenever you read a poem in translation, there is a certain feeling of loss - in this case, Carson takes that loss and uses it as a tool, instead of an impediment, uses it to show it what it actually means to be blind to beauty, or even worse, to destroy it or prevent it. Every frustrating break, every meaningless half sentence after a beautiful unfinished metaphor speaks in this powerful white space, whispering, ""This beauty was and is no more. A man, like you, destroyed it. History is a damaged cloth, and we, we men, are moths...""By the end of the book, the fragments have sheared themselves into single words, it's like listening to the broken soul of a mad person, these bursts of meaninglessness, meaningful only because we wish they were, empty, but pregnant with impossible loss:184danger185honeyvoiced186Medeia187of the Muses188mythweaver189soda190manyskilled191celery192gold anklebone cupsAnd that's the end. gold anklebone cups, and the book of history closes, a woman is put into a little book (it take about two hours to read), and tucked away into a mass of whitespace, and the shreds of what she was. If you love poetry, and you want to remember why you love it, and what life would be without it, read this book."

It's been years since I've studied poetry and I have basic knowledge of Greek history or mythology, so I struggled to interpret what Sappho is conveying; however, I'm a believer that art is an ambiguous subject and the audience is open to their own interpretation.

Anne Carson chose to recreate the fragments as much as was feasible, so many pages have only a single word or phrase. I was ready to be very skeptical only because many female and queer icons in history had to be extrapolated from scanty evidence because culture did not give living people space to have their due. In the modern era, we can often find excellent examples without having to invent them. All that aside, the few bits of poetry that remain even slightly coherent are far better than I expected, and the lesbian eroticism is gorgeously written. An extra kudos to Anne Carson again for an introduction that was not wearisome to read, gave me an appreciation for exactly how much her contemporaries respected Sappho’s work (a lot), and for demonstrating the wonder with which I could read the scattered words on the page. That alone is impressively captured in five loose pages. "
99,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/114597298-j,Rating 4 out of 5,"Frustrating but Carson has toiled to bring through the unnerving silver vision of Sappho from what is dastardly material. I found my enjoyment and connection to this, which requires you to do a lot of filling in, greatly enhanced by her lovely and familiar translator notes discussing the tendencies of a single noun, an accent, where she took and gave. Sappho herself is, of course, too much at times where enough of her work survives to create a verse - so subtle and strange. In summary: assume every poem is lesbian, every poem is about sex and desire. Where is my maiden with the lap full of violets! Where is my radiant-shaking forest! Come, be my ally - rest with me."

Sappho’s fragments are a testament to her timeless talent. It’s a travesty to have lost so much, but this collection has me so thankful that anything survived at all. Twenty five hundred years is such a mind numbing amount of time. Sappho’s writings remind that through all of the technology advances, countless wars, and general change, the human spirit has remained quite constant. Shout out to fragment 105A, my personal favorite. Julia Dubnoff’s more modern translation is very near and dear to me, but I can also deeply appreciate the literal translation. "

Iako, naravno, nije do toga što Sapfa ne zna da piše, već zbog tragičnog i nepovratnog gubitka njenih pesama kroz istoriju, sam proces čitanja ne mogu nužno da opišem kao prijatan, inspirativan ili dirljiv. Izuzeci su, naravno, oni malobrojni delovi koji nisu tako rasparčani i kojima se smisao može lako ukopčati.

Took me less than 20 minutes to read the entire book, because there were many, many pages with a handful of words on them. Some of the words were beautiful, of course, which is why we still talk about Sappho to this day, and the incompletion of the poems is obviously no fault of either Sappho, who I'm sure would have loved to have her work preserved, or the author of this novel, Anne Carson.

130,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75799600-ab,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've read fragments of Classical authors in the past but none have left me with such an enjoyable sense of discovery and curiosity as these Fragments of Sappho. For me, this is especially the case in the fragments that survive on Papyri. Carson presents the fragments as what they are, frustratingly fragmentary. It is quite easy to get bogged down in looking only at the English translation, and I found myself doing this on several occasions. In many ways, looking only at the English translation can impart the feeling of a complete poem. That is, the translation imparts a sense of completion in many of the poems. But taking the English translation alongside the Greek and paying close attention to the brackets used to note breaks in the surviving stanzas is a gratifying experience. This experience is gleaning complete words among the unintelligible fragments. Carson provides a real sense of curiosity and discovery that I was completely absorbed in. While the more extant poems drew my attention in this way, a special shout out has to be given to Carsons treatment of the really damaged papyri. These too were a real joy to read. There were many times I was left staring at the few surviving words and trying to picture to myself what the poem may have actually been like. Most importantly, Carson really added a special touch to these fragments, adding copious footnotes discussing the potential meanings and contexts. Sappho and this translator were a real treasure and I am very happy that I picked up this book. The more extant poems were very good and my personal favorite was the arrival of Hector and Andromache to Troy. This is definitely something I will be coming back to over the years.Translators please take note at Carson's work. I cannot but help to appreciate her when she openly admits that she may be reading a fragment completely wrong and provides a second translation/meaning. I really appreciate a translator discussing things like this instead of the shallow translators notes that usually come in ""public"" translations. In general the footnotes were well done and really brought a whole new sense of understanding to the fragments. "

It makes you very aware of both what is lacking but at the same time it enhances the aesthetic of the fragment.

157,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17241396-j,Rating 4 out of 5,"Sappho was a musician, her lyric poetry was composed to be song. She lived in the city of Mytilene on the island of Lesbos from 630 B.C. It is assumed that due to political affiliations she was exiled to Sicily between 604 and 595 B.C.The Greek philosopher and historian Strabo said of Sappho, 'Sappho an amazing thing, For we know in all of recorded history not one woman who can even come close to rivaling her in the grace of her poetry'. She was called 'the tenth muse' by Plato. One poem has survived intact all the rest are fragments. Her words are sensual, beautiful and put down with great passion and sometimes frustration.""no tongue breaks and thinfire is racing under skinand in eyes no sight and drummingfills earsand cold sweat holds me and shakinggrips me all, greener than grassI am and dead- or almostI seem to me.""Sappho subverts the male literary epic tradition. 'O immortal Aphrodite of the many coloured throne'. As Mary Beard says in her essay ""Sappho Speaks"", Sappho is echoing 'the words of the hero Diomedes in the midst of battle in the fifth book of Homer's Iliad when he prays for help to the goddess Athena'. Showing us the distance between the male domain epic heroism and female private concerns. Sappho is reinterpreting Homeric epic to give it a fresh female meaning. From soldiers in battle we leap to women in love. Sappho subverts the language. ""I would rather see her lovely step and the motion of light on her face than chariots of Lydians or ranks of footsoldiers in arms.""Anne Carson the translator of this work is director of graduate studies in Classics at McGill University Montreal. Carson uses brackets and line breaks in the text where there are holes or breaks in the papyrus. She also provides notes on the text for those who want a more in depth reading.This is an interesting format in which to present the work as if you the reader are reading the papyrus with all it's breaks and gaps. There is a parallel translation with the Greek provided on the facing page. She is very strict about translating word for word rather than translating the flow or feeling so this is not a loose presentation of the work. You find yourself filling in the gaps. As it is a faithful reflection of the work, some pages have only two or three words on them. I'm sure somebody more interested in poetry can appreciate and find beauty in the spareness of the book. I found myself surmising about what was left out by cause of destruction. It's an interesting approach, in a sense the incompleteness encourages the reader to engage more with the work. Still in my opinion this faithful plain approach doesn't always reflect the passion of the work fully but is true to it.""Eros shook mymind like a mountain wind falling on oak trees""Sometimes her words are prescient.""someone will remember usI sayeven in another time""."

After all, how else can a fragment be defined? Part of a larger, missing, whole. But the translator did a fantastic job changing the trajectory from a dry presentation of the crumbs history has left us to a poetic, melancholy longing for something more. And the end-notes are as interesting to read as the fragments themselves, opening a tantalizing new window behind the translated words.Highly recommend. I'm thinking I might need my own copy."

Everything she says sets the mind racing.Only criticisms would be is that I feel Carson had a tendency to present readings that undermined the lesbianism of Sappho herself and her companions. Also the published book could’ve been more compact, some 3 word long fragments took up whole pages and I was basically concerned about the environment the whole time. "

181,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67814323-mimi,Rating 5 out of 5,"One of my favorites this year! Anne Carson does a spectacular job at not only conveying the sense of all that was lost— what once was and is now forever a mystery— but, as she says in the introduction, allows Sappho to shine brightly throughout the work. Though I have always appreciated the legacy of Sappho, I had not read much more than a couple lines of her work before I picked this book up. I didn’t know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised by the rawness, beauty, and poignancy of her words. What is there and what is left to the shadow of millennia past all culminate to a distinct feeling for the spirit of the icon that was and is Sappho. Here are some lines that stuck out to me: “..your sweet speaking and lovely laughing—oh it puts the heart in my chest on wings for when I look at you, even a moment, no speaking  is left in meno: tongue breaks and thin fire is racing under skin and in no sight and drumming  fills earsand cold sweat holds me and shaking grips me all, greener than grass I am and dead—or almost I seem to me. But all is to be dared….” “Eros shook my mind like a mountain wind falling on oak trees”“For the man who is beautiful is beautiful to seebut the good man will at once also beautiful be.”“I would rather see her lovely step and the motion of light on her face than chariots of Lydians or ranks of footsoldiers in arms.”“I simply want to be dead. Weeping she left me with many tears and said this:Oh how badly things have turned out for us. Sappho, I swear, against my will I leave you.” “as sometimes at sunset  the roseyfingered moon surpasses all the stars. And her light  stretches over salt sea  equally and flowerdeep fields…..But she goes back and forth remembering  gentle Atthis and in longing  she bites her tender mind……]into desire I shall come”“but me you have forgotten or you love some man more than me”“I have a beautiful child who is like golden flowers in form, darling Kleisin exchange for whom I would not  all Lydia or lovely”“Atthis, to you it has become hateful to think of me and you fly to Andromeda”“…..that shepherd men with their feet trample down and on the ground the purple  flower”“And with sweet oil costly you anointed yourselfand on a soft bed delicate you would let loose your longing and neither any [ ] nor anyholy place nor was there from which we were absent no grove[ ]no dance  ]no sound”"

183,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30131258-alina,Rating 5 out of 5,"This collection is unbelievable. It is both ancient and new, which is made possible by Carson’s interpretive decisions. She makes visual the ways in which the translated words are fragmented off from larger, unknown spans of text. This has a stunning effect. I saw myself handling an artifact, rescued from time. Under this sense, I couldn’t help but be keenly interested in a certain way that I wish were present in more of my reading experiences. I was interested in glimpsing what was originally there, which helped my overall focus and increased the energy of my imagination in interpreting the text. Moreover, this visual presentation (often resulting in only one or two words in a line, spaced apart from the next word by many empty lines) had an experimental and new feel, unlike reading classics at large. I am left sensitized to the visual aspect of poetry in a new way and wish to carry this into my reading and writing into the future. Here are some lines I particularly liked:""]to give]yet of the glorious]of the beautiful and good, you	]of pain		[me]blame]swollen]you take your fill.

184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108606192-jenny,Rating 5 out of 5,"I would give this six stars if I could. A lot of Sappho's writing has been lost to time, and Anne Carson incorporates these gaps and missing pieces into the layout of the book. She uses brackets and empty space to visualize what is Not There Anymore, which sometimes ends up with a poem being harder to understand, or even only two or three fragmentary words remaining.Other times, longer, intact passages exist, but in all cases, the poetry is nothing short of beautiful. Mind you, I don't speak Greek, so my judgement of the translation is of course limited. However, I hope to look at some more translations and secondary literature soon! I'm not a classics student, so of course my understanding of Sappho will stay somewhat limited.This really lives up to the title ""Fragments of Sappho"". While I was reading it, I felt like there often was a tragic beauty to these fragments. They left me wondering what the full poem might have been, what meaning the only surviving word would have served in a larger context, but I also knew we would probably never get at it. It's just gone. And yet, Anne Carson has made a wonderful work out of this. She furthers her translations with endnotes, includes both the Greek and the English text, and leaves lots of space to visualize the fragmentary nature of the sources.This was a lovely reading experience. I already know this will be one of those books that I will read over and over again."

Cada fragmento/poema ocupa una página y, a la derecha, está el texto griego, así que funciona bastante bien si se quiere hacer una lectura pausada o cuidadosa de la obra de Safo. La traducción de Anne Carson también me encantó, si bien es más literaria que literal, creo que consigue captar magníficamente el sentimiento de la poeta eólica :C Aunque se trata de fragmentos (algunos con apenas dos palabras), Carson consigue imbuirlos de nostalgia o de pasión, idk, sólo que esta traducción te hace sentir mucho.En cuanto al aparato crítico, es más bien poco. Esta edición está pensada para un público general, así que las notas que hay al texto son breves y señalan cuestiones bastante precisas; también, al inicio, hay una introducción corta que busca acercar al lector de a pie a Safo y los problemas que existen alrededor de ella y de su obra.

188,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84449995-phillip-dupesovski,Rating 5 out of 5,"On the subject of Sappho and her community of girls, Mary Beard once posed the questions to the audience of her blog, ""Should we see her as a school mistress with a crush on her favourite pupils? Or was she more like a brothel-keeper? Or leader of a louche lesbian coven?"". I like to think that Sappho was all three, and so much more, as only a poet of a thousand minds would be able to attain the cultural significance that she has achieved in perpetuity. And Anne Carson’s rendition treats the Aeolic Greek of aeons ago so well, that 'If Not, Winter' takes on a life-force of its own, existing beyond the notion of ordinary translation. For she presents us with the fractured reality of what remains of the Sapphic corpus; something that is a kind of beauty in itself. Like the gleaming white statues of the Greco-Roman world, all stripped of their rich colours, Sappho’s fragments are a shell of what they once were. But the weathering passage of history has become a phenomenon to accept, grow to admire, and perhaps even recognise as an art-form of that which the sands of time have so munificently left for us - these offerings of a poet who was a warrior of the written word, a woman, and a world-eater."

""Even though you are approaching Sappho in translation, that is no reason you should miss the drama of trying to read a papyrus torn in half or riddled with holes or smaller than a postage stamp--brackets imply a free space of imaginal adventure.
Reading the above note in Anne Carson's introduction, I couldn't help but think that there's something infinitely appropriate in trying to decipher meaning from Sappho's fragments. It mirrors, a little, the way we piece together our history and identity as queer women growing up (and it's neat how the act of reading Sappho itself makes us feel a little closer to that history). It's all an endless act of translation, adaptation, piecing together meaning from fragments.But for the first time, it feels exciting rather than frustrating. Like Carson put it, an imaginal adventure.This was definitely the translation I wanted to read. The language was simple, accessible, and still lyrical and evocative. What struck me the most where the small, one-line fragments, and they remain my favourites (along with the very first one, fr. 1). I don't know what it is about bitten-off sentences and phrases that conveys so much meaning. How poignant simple fragments like ""as long as you want"" and ""you burn me"" are. Maybe it's the possibility, the way my brain immediately fills it in and feels allowed to supply its own meaning. The notes at the end were also great, and sometimes funny, and they supplied a lot of context, so I'd definitely recommend reading those too."

This book is literally fragments of Sappho’s writing. Her words on desire, emotion, festival, longing, and love. It’s remarkable how we have access to Aristotle’s writing (albeit some of it is lost), Plato’s works, but when it comes to Sappho, who was a highly skilled musician and has been mentioned in numerous texts, we don’t have much of her work. Anne Carson does a wonderful job in brining yet another forgotten piece of women’s writing to the forefront by translating the only partially existing poetry written by Sappho. It’s a wonderful re-imagining of the words that are lost and the desire that Sappho radiates via her poems."

If Not Winter are the remaining fragments of Greek poet Sappho. Anne Carson translates these remaining fragments, and keeps the empty space created by the weathering of time. The poems that remain are delicate, full of beautiful imagery of Greek mythos, sex, yearning, loss, and sapphic love. (Sappho is where that term comes from! As well as Lesbian!) The empty space leaves so much for interpretation. It allows the reader to theorize what was once there, allowing for every reader to have a perspective or experience entirely unique to them. It’s beautiful to see how art can affect people in entirely unintentional ways. And yeah I might’ve teared up once or twice just thinking about that."

The simplicity and beauty of Sappho was refreshing, and the veil of mystery that comes with the reading due to all of the missing lines adds to the power. In fact, one of the best experiences of the collection is this mystery. Carson formats the book so that you can “see” the edges of the papyri that these fragments were found on. Some poems have only the middle strip of a whole page, some the top half, others a full page but with holes in the manuscript so that there are words missing. I loved this editorial choice as it truly let the reader mindfully inhabit the act of reading. Additionally, having the Greek text opposite the English was a huge boon to me, having taken three years of Greek myself.

264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1134884-scott,Rating 4 out of 5,"Anne Carson’s If Not, Winter (2002) is a very beautiful book that makes a flattering frame for the relics of Sappho’s enigmatic verse. Both a musician and poet, Sappho lived on the island of Lesbos 2,600 years ago. Her music has perished, but fragments of her lyrics 	– wedding songs, hymns to Aphrodite, pleas to her brother, plaints for the loss of lovers, a song for her daughter, all infused with great passion and feeling – survive in tattered papyri and ancient commentaries. Of her nine books of poetry, only one full poem and scattered remnants remain, just enough to whet our interest in a poet whose influence was so great in antiquity that she was known as the Tenth Muse. Anne Carson – poet, graphic artist, classical scholar – collects all the crumbs of Sappho’s poetry and offers a translation in clean modern English that’s lyrical and yet so literal that it could serve well as a crib. Her intent, she explains, is to render Sappho “in the plainest language I could find, using where possible the same order of words and thoughts.” True to her texts, Carson gives us not only the words and thoughts of the Greek manuscripts, but the blanks as well.The blanks? Imagine if all we had of Shakespeare’s sonnets were thin strips of words ripped from a few of his poems. What would “That time of year” (sonnet 73) look like? “… thou mayest … or none … which shake … where late … the twilight … fadeth … black night.” The mood is clear, but the full meaning remains a mystery. Readers are faced with the temptation to supply missing words, to fill in the blanks and tell the whole story. It wouldn’t be Shakespeare, but still, how spellbinding. Sappho’s poetry is the same. So much is fragmented, offering only images and moods, that some translators have, well, elaborated upon them, added private thoughts and presumptions in an effort to chink the papyrus’s holes.Carson, on the other hand, doesn’t indulge in this sort of interpolation; that’s not to say, though, that she isn’t eager to have her readers stretch their imaginations and explore possibilities for humor and passion. To allow for this, she makes clear what’s missing in the original; her renderings are incrusted with a rich growth of brackets [ ], used “to give an impression of missing matter” in the original text. “Brackets are exciting,” says Carson, who doesn’t want us to “miss the drama of trying to read a papyrus torn in half or riddled with holes.” For her, “brackets imply a free space of imaginal adventure,” where readers create meanings that the fragments only suggest. So a typical poem (78) reads in Carson’s translation,]	] now	] desire	] but all at once	] blossom	] desire	] took delightIf these are the crumbs, what must dinner have been like? Filling in the blanks can become a warm afternoon's obsession. A few more snippets hint at the richness of the banquet we’ve missed. gathering flowers so very delicate a girl I don’t know what to do   two states of mind in me (shades of Catullus’ Odi et amo)Eros the melter of limbs (now again) stirs me –sweetbitter unmanageable creature who steals in messenger of spring    nightingale with a voice of longing stand to face me belovedand open out the grace of your eyesneither for me honey nor the honey beeyou burn meOr the almost complete poem:Moon has setand Pleiades: middlenight, the hour goes by,alone I lie.If you like the idea of picking through ruins, playing the role of a literary archaeologist, then Sappho can yield a lifetime of pleasure, though her works in translation will take no more than an hour to read. Her fragments are passionate and suggestive, and if you have a speck of Greek you will enjoy Sappho’s original poetry, printed in red on the facing page. The translations are set in Mrs Eaves, a lovely typeface that the designers have leaded very well to balance the acres of white space on each page. In fact, most pages have fewer than twenty words on them, underscoring by their emptiness how much of Sappho’s wonderful poetry has been lost."

274,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4569445-joshua,Rating 5 out of 5,"An interesting thing occurred to me while looking up Sappho on Tumblr: there are so many quotes taken out of context. I kept seeing them and saying to myself, “No, that’s not what that means! You can’t just take the first half off and keep the second half! It changes the meaning!” Well, in the middle of this verbal rant to myself I realized that since most of what we have from Sappho is fragments, this is entirely what scholars have to deal with in the study of her poetry. There’s so much that we can only grasp at because we don’t have the context. Take fragment 87E and F (the Anne Carson translation) as an example:]]queen]]]]]to you]]horse]]]What are we supposed to do with that? It is interesting how the broken fragments of what’s left of her poetry can read as some powerful postmodern pieces, but that has everything to do with the translation and the reader rather than the original work. A line like “and I on a soft pillow will lay down my limbs” might seem like it perfectly captures the essence of weariness, but the only reason we have it is because Herodian cited it because of the interesting word used for “cushion” (here translated as “pillow”). As to what the poem is actually about--well, your guess is as good as anyone else’s, because that’s all we have of it. The image is powerful, but in the end, the power lies mostly in the reader, unfortunately. We have no context to put the lines in, so we have no way of knowing if it is a bittersweet statement--resting after trouble--or a statement of simple serenity or even a statement of sensuality.Reading her poetry, for the most part feels like participating in a detective story, grasping for clues to find the meaning. That’s all you can do--read what the scholars think of it and wonder.Since having this realization though, I’ve found a pleasurable way to pass the time. I’ve been taking down books of poems from my shelf--Keats, Wordsworth, Lawrence, Whitman, Shakespeare--and broken up their poems into fragments. It’s difficult to repeat the concept behind actual fragments, since there’s no real way to unconsciously break up the poem--the mind naturally tends towards making patterns--but it is interesting to see some more familiar poets in a similar light as Sappho. In the end, it makes me appreciate even more all the works that we have complete, despite all the elements that could’ve removed them from us entirely."
275,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42750874-victoria,Rating 1 out of 5,"I feel awful rating this book so low since I know how much work it must have been to translate all of this and try to keep the English translations as similar as possible to Sappho's original texts. Unfortunately, however, this style of translation just wasn't for me. I picked this book up after reading Mary Barnard's Sappho: A New Translation, which I loved. This book is meant to mimic the way the fragments appear now, while Barnard's translations creates links between the pieces to make them read like full poems. While I understand almost all of Sappho's poems are in fragments, it was quite difficult for me to read it as such. The majority of this book had poems with 1-3 words on a page with brackets covering most of the pages, which honestly gave me a headache to read and many of these words would be spaced out with no clear relation to each other, which made it frustrating to essentially be reading random words. An example of this would be one poem with a single word: celery. I realize that this is either all that is left/all that is legible enough to be translated, but it felt a little pointless to read just the word ""celery"" and pages like that, of which there were many, sadly made me want to stop reading despite it being such a short book.I will say however, that this book could be beneficial for someone learning to read Greek since the original text is on one side of the page and the English translation is on the other. This was very interesting for me to see, but since I don't know any Greek it wasn't beneficial to me personally, though I'm sure it comes in useful for many readers.(There is also some discussion over whether Sappho was a lesbian or bi, either way though it's clear she was wlw. In this translation however, her attraction to women was almost completely erased. Fragments normally translated with female pronouns were switched to male pronouns or just left out. In the introduction, her attraction to women was mentioned, but it was left out in the actual translation, which is very disappointing.)"
276,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127680014-roxy,No Rating,"Gifted to me for my 20th birthday by my good friend Mia Fong. Much to say about the power of translators. Sappho makes a few dreaded comments about virginity, and the desire to revisit and even long for it. One of my favorite details was when a character prays to Aphrodite: “I pray to you…all the wrongs [my brother] did before, ‘loose it’.”Loose” over “lose” — to assist the consequence of the wrongs rather to abandon or abolish them altogether. The term “loose” is used throughout the text: “you would let loose your longing” was another favorite of mine. To not ask for the abandonment of longing, emotion, or yearning, but rather ask for the emotions to become more bearable, like to loosen coils"

281,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147154-matt,Rating 5 out of 5,"Sappho is one of the greatest poets out of ancient Greece. Her poems are beautiful, personal, and well structured. They also come down to us largely in fragments. Anne Carson, a phenomenal poet in her own right, has used the fragmentary nature of Sappho's surviving oeuvre to create a translation that is a work of art in itself. Rather than covering the gaps, or marking them in the same tedious way that is often done with other translations of fragmented works, Carson makes the gaps an important part of each piece. This book is not just a good translation of Sappho's poems, it's also a monument to all of the works that we have lost. The organization of her translations provides the reader with a visceral sense of that loss. The title is one of the fragments, all we can do is wonder what the rest of the poem would have been like."

321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20886755-lenore,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have now read three translations of Sappho's poetry, namely Poems and Fragments (translator: Stanley Lombardo), If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho (translator: Anne Carson), and Come Close, adapted from Stung With Love: Poems and Fragments (translator: Aaron Poochigan). It strikes me as interesting how the versions of the poems vary from edition to edition, depending on the translator's endeavor to preserve the original text or to adapt it for an English-speaking poetry audience.Take one of the more straightforward verses, for instance the opening of fragment xvi:Version A: (via Anne Carson) Some man say an army of horse and some men say an army on foot and some man say an army of ships is the most beautiful thing on the black earth. But I say it is what you love.Version B: (via Stanley Lombardo) Some say an army on horseback, some say on foot, and some say ships are the most beautiful things on this black earth, but I say it is whatever you love.Version C: (via Aaron Poochigan) Some call ships, infantry or horsemen The greatest beauty Earth can offer; I say it is whatever a person Most lusts after.Even if you haven't read fragment xvi in the original, it is fairly obvious which translation comes closest to the way the poem would have read more than 2000 years ago. Anne Carson's voice is almost entirely absent from her version of Sappho's words, giving the reader a portrayal of Ancient Greek poetry that is as authentic as possible. In contrast, Aaron Poochigan's translation clearly imitates Western tradition, complete with line capitalization, a semi-colon and ABAB rhyme. His adaptation technique works well in some instances, but his liberty with Sappho's poetic form erases structural aspects vital for poetic resonance, such as sequence of thoughts, like in this famous fragment:Version A (via Anne Carson): Someone will remember us I say Even in another timeVersion B (via Aaron Poochigan): I declare That later on, Even in an age unlike our own, Someone will remember who we are.While such Westernization of Sappho's poetry may be easier to digest in modern times, I cannot stress the importance of a text's accurate translation over its cultural integration. If we truly want to hear Sappho's words, we have to let her speak without Western filter. Otherwise it's like we traveled back in time only to colonize the literature of Ancient Greece for the sheer hubris of listening to the echo of our own voices.*Note: I personally prefer Stanley Lombardo's translation, as it seems to remain truthful to its source while demonstrating an awareness of our current poetic landscape."
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/157189857-maddie-bagley,No Rating,"IDK if I am going to rate this on a star scale because it is so much more than ""Did I like this poetry?""Sappho was a legendary poet in ancient Greece, referred to as the 10th muse. She was a big freaking deal! And yet, we only have fragments of her work. Imagine your favorite musician, movie, book, etc. but we only have bits and pieces. So it is absolutely haunting to consider all we are missing, and it is so important to treasure the snippets of her words. I'm so glad her phrase ""Someone will remember us I say even in another time"" survives to be true. While most are lost, what remnants we do have are really quite lovely. And the fragments are interesting as is, in a black-out poetry way. Sappho's surviving work is very focused on love: romantic, sexual, and fellowship. Her longings and encounters are directed toward both men and women, and, as she lived on the island of Lesbos, the etymology of ""lesbian"" is derived from Sappho's affection for women! This specific translator chose the simplest translation possible and then included more vivid imagery and potential nuances in the notes at the end of the book. I reallly wish they (and the character explanations) were integrated as footnotes. For this reason, my reading came much more from an intellectual lens than one of trying to enjoy the imagery. This intellectual pursuit was very much supplemented by my recent readings of Cloud Cuckoo Land (having ancient texts is a wondrous miracle) and Babel (translation is in essence, an act of betrayal). Some takeaways from book club discussion: People in the past fell in love and were deeply passionate. They were distracted by crushes, just like us modern folks. Women have always been capable of deep philosophy and beautiful creations, and their works should be valued and remembered. Queer people have always existed and their love is as valid and transcendent as hetero love.I'm interested to research what further art this poetry has inspired because there is sooo much potential."
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5826011-dominique,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 stars So beautiful and so haunting. Have earmarked A LOT of pages. There’s something really amazing about the idea that...this lyric poetry was sung once, in long-ago Ancient Greece / Turkey, from a real-life person with real-life desires and sorrows and feelings...and there is nothing whatsoever to distinguish them from any modern-day person now. And I really love how it puts paid to the idea that lesbianism is some kind of modern invention — this is from thousands of years ago. Were Sappho’s lyrics covered by a patriarchy that assumed women could never feel that way? Did they simply not care or look too deeply? It’s really something to consider that not long after her own life, Sappho was FAMOUS. Her lyrics, their meaning, was valued — and yet, this was also a society of systemic female oppression, on a truly remarkable scale (even by the standards of Western Europe).One thing that surprised me, actually, was how...not-Sapphic they were? And I use that word as opposed to ‘lesbian’ as it’s less anachronistic, but I suppose I’m trying to say that I was expecting lyrics far more...erotic, suggestive? They really weren’t; much more in the vein of romantic, idealised; brief sketches of moments and people — in short, far more homoerotic than erotic. There are lyrics on grand human themes like time, sorrow, yearning etc that I think are far more worldly, rounded and applicable to all than ‘Sappho’ is generally allowed to be in the popular imagination (which puts her squarely in the ‘lesbian’ box)— in many ways, far more accessible than the male-only arenas of war like the The Iliad or the Odyssey would allow. One of the other things I really loved and wasn’t necessarily anticipating was her lyrics on the gods, her prayers and conversations with them, her descriptions of them. Despite their spare, crisp descriptions, there was something so beautifully evocative about their appearances that I’ve seen only a few writers manage. "

326,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39598527-briana,Rating 4 out of 5,"I decided to take a dive into some ancient Western poetry and literature from the Greeks and Romans to get a sense of how much things have stayed the same. Anne Carson is a figure that people interested in the literary world hear a lot and I was excited to pick up If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho which Anne Carson translated. Sappho was a poetess from the island of Lesbos but there isn’t much known about her life. She’s written tons of poetry but only one full poem has survived and the rest are fragments. This book is literally a collection of those fragments.What’s striking is the fact that these words hold true to the contemporary world as well. It is assumed that Sappho took on female lovers and probably loved them as much as she loved men and there is some evidence of this in the way that she speaks about the womanly form here. She has reverence for women and a love for them that is beyond friendship. With every translated work, a lot of the labor is on the translator because they have to be able to convey the same emotion that was intended. Anne Carson did a wonderful job of this to keep us all engaged and to bring this to the contemporary world we are living in.Unfortunately, I was in a bit of a rush reading this as I borrowed this from the library but I am happy I was able to sit down and read this all during Pride Month. Sappho was witty and sharp—her poetry has the power to pierce and stun us with the imagery and prose. To put it simply, this is a gorgeous bilingual book that features the Greek and English translation which is perfect. This makes me want to go to a Greek village on the coast and just stare at the moonlight above the Mediterranean Sea while reading this."
327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42003230-anna,Rating 5 out of 5," To read such a text is hard even when it comes to us in its entirety and most papyri don't. Of the nine books of lyrics that Sappho is said to have composed, one poem has survived complete. All the rest are fragments. (Introduction) Fewer things make me more sad than the fact that only one entire poem of Sappho has stood the test of time. Fragment 34 for example: ""stars around the beautiful moon / hide back their luminous form / whenever all full the she shines / on the earth / silvery"" or a line like ""neither for me honey nor the honey bee"" (fragment 146). I think we are missing out on so much beautiful poetry, it just makes me, ugh, you know. I emphasize the distinction between brackets and no brackets because it will affect your reading experience, if you will allow it. Brackets are exciting. Even though you are approaching Sappho in translation, that is no reason you should miss the drama of trying to read a papyrus torn in half or riddled with holes or smaller than a postage stamp - brackets imply a free space of imaginal adventure.(…)As acts of deterrence these stories carry their own kind of thrill - at the inside edge where her words go missing, a sort of antipoem that condenses everything you ever wanted her to write (Introduction) This is the only thing that I think positive of the lost parts of her nine books. I think this translation to be a really good one and I urge you to read it, as Sappho is so, so worth to be read and to be remembered:
 someone will remember us / I say / even in another time (fragment 147)

If Not, Winter is a stunning work both of poetry, but also of translation. Anne Carson gathers every existing little scrap of Sappho's poetry and sets herself the task of translating a work that is only fragments of itself, and she does it beautifully. 
Eveningyou gather backall that dazzling dawn has put asunderyou gather a lambgather a kidgather a child to its mother.
Through the use of the original Greek text, and the representation of her translation with deliberate ellipsis and brackets, the reader is given space to appreciate both the stunning power of the existing words and the staggering loss that all the white space on a page represents. Carson is a poet herself (I'll be checking out her work after this), and it really shows, as she coaxes extremely simple turns of phrases into a subtle beauty.
