It's quite an odd book and an overall rating might be the sum of the parts, but is not going to reflect the writing or content of those parts. Ratings, part I, 1 star, part II, 3 stars and part III, 5 stars.The first part, the foreword, by Abraham Verghese, was verbose, hagiographic and contradictory ie. full of shit. He said he didn't know the author at all until after his death. Then he says well he did meet him and they had a long email correspondence. And so it goes. He says it's the foreword but should be the afterword. Verghese must have sat there with a thesaurus composing endless sentences of praise for the author, who had, like most of us, never accomplished anything much out of the ordinary. I dnf'd this part and give it a whole, rounded-up 1 star.The second part, I feel churlish writing this, I really do. The author had an interesting career in his short life, mostly as a student. He had a MA in English Literature, another MA in History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine, a BSc in Human Biology and finally an MD from Yale, before going on to be a neurosurgeon. It was in his brief career as a neurosurgeon and scientist he was diagnosed with cancer. He tried his best to be introspective and give guidance through the exponentially-increasing awfulness that is the journey through this dread disease. The problem was, he wasn't a natural writer although he'd wanted to be one all his life. His prose might have been just the stuff of essays at his Ivy League universities, but to me it was reminiscent of a writers' group where each attempt to outdo the other with portent-laden phrases and lots of deep literary references. It was tedious in parts. But... he did his best and he was a good doctor, husband and father, and this was only his debut book. Five stars for the man, but three stars, just, for this central section of the book.The long afterword was written by his widow. She is a doctor too, but could easily be a writer. She just has 'it' and her late husband, who wanted it so much, didn't. She rounds out the story he told, and continued on at length in the most interesting and well-written part of the book. Her ability to convey emotion without getting either lyrical or sappy was excellent. Five stars. Dr. Lucy Kalanithi should have been credited as co-author. I hope she goes on writing.It won't make sense to read the last part without the second, but you can easily skip the foreword, all it adds is unnecessary verbiage and lots of pages to make it look more than just the thin tome it really is.________________An example of the really rather awful writing that got me down. You may disagree, you may feel that the three words I suggest - dawn came up, are no substitute for the 150 poetic, lyrical, descriptive ones the author wrote instead. I'm too hard, right? ""And then we would sit and watch as the first hint of sunlight, a light tinge of day blue would leak out of the eastern horizon, slowly erasing the stars. The day sky would spread wide and high until the first ray of the sun made an appearance. The morning commuters began to animate the distant south Lake Tahoe roads but craning your head back you could see the day's blue darken halfway across the sky and to the west the night remained yet unconquered. Pitch black, stars in full glimmer, the full moon still pinned in the sky. To the east the full light of the day beamed toward you. To the west, night reigned with no hint of surrender. No philosopher can explain the sublime better than this, standing between day and night. It was as if this was the moment God said, ""Let there be light.""Very poetic, very beautiful image. So anyway, dawn came up. "
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s,Rating 4 out of 5,"As I finished this book with tears running down my face I asked myself, ""Why did you read this book? You know it was going to be sad, how could a man dying of lung cancer before the age of forty be anything but."" Yet to just classify this memoir, to classify this novel as such is to devalue the man he was. He was a lover of literature, a neurosurgeon, a scientist, a son and brother, a husband and father. He tried to live each day to the best of his ability, he helped many and he acknowledged the doctor patient relationship had a big disconnect with the reality of life, how their lives would change after being diagnosed with a serious illness. He was not a saint, he cried when given a death sentence, but his thoughts were not always for him, he always wanted to make sure his wife had a life after he was gone. So in many ways this was a profoundly beautiful read by a remarkable man. His wife says it best, ""What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy."""
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell,Rating 5 out of 5,"I don't think you should read this book because the story of an incredibly gifted man who had his life taken away at such a young age might give you the motivation to live life more fully. I think you should read this book because that talented, inspiring man has incredibly important things to say derived from his own experiences, and it's important to listen and learn from them. Read this book with the knowledge that you might not always be able to understand everything someone goes through, but you can set aside the time to listen to their story and hopefully give them the dignity and respect they deserve as a human being, in life or death. “Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.” -Paul Kalanithi"
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5653827-aisling,Rating 3 out of 5,"Oh dear. I was always told not to speak ill of the dead. It feels awful to give a three star rating to a nice guy (by all accounts) who is now dead. But I simply did not find this book compelling or insightful enough. It is mildly interesting to learn about neurosurgery as a specialty and to read the author's thoughts as he faced diagnosis, illness and then death. I always felt that the author was holding back; that it was too clinical, too calm, just not passionate enough. The first time I felt that I was reading something worthwhile was in the 26 page epilogue by the author's wife. I guess the best way to say it is this; this is a quick read. And of course it should not be. "
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1246837-maggie-stiefvater,Rating 5 out of 5,"A gasping, desperate, powerful little book, bigger on the inside than outside. It's a little bit about dying, but more about being alive."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58160628-emily-books-with-emily-fox-on-youtube,No Rating,"Do yourself a favour and don't listened to the ending of this book while doing your makeup...Theres no way to review a book where the author died too young from cancer leaving his wife and 8 months old baby behind without feeling like an asshole for not giving it 5 stars.That’s why more often than not, I don’t give a rating to the autobiographies I read. I just don’t feel comfortable rating someone’s life.Cancer and the death of a close one is something most of us unfortunately can relate to and I think it’s why this book got so popular.I’m glad the author was able to write this book since it was his dream but in my opinion the best part of it was the epilogue from his wife. I’m sure it’s where most of us ended up ugly crying. "
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101693182-tharindu-dissanayake,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Death comes for all of us. For us, for our patients: it is our fate as living, breathing, metabolizing organisms.""Though 'When Breath Becomes Air' had been on my shelf for a while now, I've been going back and forth, unable to decide whether I should read this, as I was somewhat fearful of the impact this memoir might have on me. One must always brace himself/ herself when reading a book like this, for, you dive in knowing well about the inevitable heartbreaking ending. But, now that I'm finished, the only thing I regret is not reading the book sooner. Dr. Paul Kalanithi's insightful, beautiful and emotional memoir is something that everyone must read. ""What makes life meaningful enough to go on living?""The first half of the story is not what I had expected at all. Dr. Kalanithi starts from his childhood, little briefing about the family background and the turning points which directed him towards becoming a doctor, followed by the years in medical school. But what he focuses on most during the first half of the book is, the difficulties faced by a Resident, prior to graduation. The exhausting journey a Resident has to make is explained in a very captivating manner, allowing the reader to empathize with all medical professionals. This part of the book has been an eye-opener for me, for, never had I imagined it to be this much demanding. But it's not only that. He also goes on to describing moral/ ethical dilemmas one had to face, and the different ways each person deals with critical situations.""At those critical junctures, the question is not simply whether to live or die but what kind of life is worth living.""With the starting of second half, Dr. Kalanithi moves on to challenges he had to encounter after his diagnosis. The personal experiences are sometime quite overwhelming, navigating through an alternating curve where we continuously switch between hope and despair. Even with knowing the ending, it's difficult not to become hopeful that everything might get better and then stay that way. In my opinion, this latter half of the book is therapeutic for any reader, because, if one had already experienced a similar situation, they'll be able to relate and ease their pain at least a little, while others will understand the anguish and pain suffered by the patients and their families. The way you view people - not just the terminal patients, but any hardships faced by fellow human beings - will change profoundly.""I feared I was on the way to becoming Tolstoy's stereotype of a doctor, preoccupied with empty formalism, focused on the rote treatment of disease - and utterly missing the larger human significance.""Another thing that is going to surprise the readers is the beautiful use of language where Dr. Kalanithi's skills in literature and language really shines through. The narrative is not something one would expect from a doctor. Two main chapters are followed by the epilogue by Lucy Kalanithi, which is even more heartbreaking. But it is commendable how well she completes memoir, and delivering us this remarkable book. Reading preferences notwithstanding, I urge every reader to go through this book, at least once. It won't take you more than a couple of hours, but this book will profoundly change the way you see the world. Thank you, Dr. Paul Kalanithi, for your last, but most exceptional contribution to posterity.
""Science may provide the most useful way to organize empirical, reproductible data, but its power to do so is predicated on its inability to grasp the most central aspects of human life: hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue.""

""Yeah. Yeah, I like happy endings.""

8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57797254-cindy,Rating 3 out of 5,"I enjoy memoirs, but this one didn't grip me as much as others have, which is a shame considering how beloved this book seems to be. I admire Paul's resilience and passion for the world and his relationships, and I felt most compelled by his wife's conclusion towards the end when he couldn't complete his book. I think what kept me from being emotionally engrossed in this book was the writing. I would have appreciated more descriptions and storytelling about his experiences and relationships, rather than being told these things. There's lots of talk about finding the value in life, and I would have liked to read more scenes, examples, etc. to support those notions."
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8325737-philipp,Rating 2 out of 5,"alternative title: ""How the upper class dies""Autobiographical book by a guy who's trained and studied all his life, nearly became a writer, then chose to become a doctor instead (that's what happens when you come from a family of medical doctors), and is diagnosed with cancer at the end of his training. Torschlusspanik [1] sets in and he has to write that one book he always wanted to write. It's partially an autobiography of his training, a hymn to his wife, and a bit on patient-doctor relationship.Sometimes it's way too pretentious for its own good, lots of classical lit, lots of poetry quotes, lots of namedropping - who on earth reads Wittgenstein to a newborn?? - and sometimes it's too sentimental and just straight-up walks into Tuesdays with Morrie territory. It is not an ugly death - for that the family is too well-trained in medicine to ""fight"" ultimately senseless fights, too well-acquainted with death to cause a fuss, too rich to die in a dump, too well-connected to suffer bad doctors.The last chapter written by the wife after his death is probably the best - still, I wouldn't recommend it, not much new, not that interesting [2]. Would make a good book for Oprah's Book Club.I can guarantee you that yours and my death will be much worse than what is described here. Here there is no constant vomiting, no blood, no mucus, no week-long screaming from the pain. Death is too clean, like the book itself.[1] One of the best words we have in German - literally ""gate closing panic"", it usually denotes a woman who starts to behave unusual once she realises that her child-bearing age window is closing, but it can be used to describe everyone who starts to behave unusual once time starts to run out[2] It feels extremely mean to write that about a guy's work who has just died"
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse-walters,Rating 5 out of 5,"1/12/16: Update: Just wanted to mention that this book goes on sale today. Its an amazing story!Paul Kalanithi studied literature at Stanford University. For his thesis, he studied the work of Walt Whitman, a poet , who a century before, was possessed by the same questions that haunted him. Kalanithi wanted to find a way to understand and describe what he termed ""the Physiological-Spiritual Man."" Kalanithi had a passion for literature. He began to see language as an almost supernatural force, existing between people, bringing our brains, shielded in centimeter-thick skulls, into communion. ""There must be a way, I thought, that the language of life as experienced – – of passion, hunger, of love – – bore some relationship, however convoluted, to the language of neurons, digestive tracks, and heartbeats.""Paul Kalanithi's thesis was well-received -- but neuroscience as literary criticism didn't quite fit in the English Department. ( nor did he). There was a question he couldn't let go of. ""Where did Biology, morality, literature, and philosophy intersect?"".Kalanithi consulted a premed advisor - set aside his passion for literature - and figured out the logistics to get ready for medical school. He was still searching for answers to the question ""what makes human life meaningful, even in the face of death and decay?""When he was in his fourth year medical school, he watched many classmates choose to specialize in less demanding areas, (radiology or dermatology for example). It puzzled him that many students focused on lifestyle specialities--those with more humane hours, higher salaries, and lower pressures. For himself, he chose neurosurgery as a specialty. Kalanithi was diagnosed with Cancer. ( he actually was almost certain he had cancer many months before getting an X-Ray or MRI). Once it was clear that the cancer had invaded multiple organ systems--( ""severe illness wasn' life altering--it was life shattering""), decisions needed to be made. His wife Lucy, father, siblings, doctors were all involved - and chemo would start soon. Clarifying the rest of his life ( only age 36 at the time), was going to be a process. He and Lucy went to visit a sperm bank to preserve gametes and options. They had planned on having kids at the end of his residency. To think. Paul Kalanithi wrote this book - relentlessly- fueled with purpose during the last year of his life -- never got to finish his life's plan..( yet he still worked that last year).... But he was racing against time. With this book - he was hoping to confront death - examine it- accept it-- as a physician and a patient. He wanted to help other people understand death and face their mortality. ""It's not exotic..but tragic enough and imaginable enough he says"". There is a beautiful - but so sad- Epilogue by Lucy - from Paul's wife at the end of the book. Their baby had been born eight months before Paul died - March 9th, 2015. Lucy reports that Paul let himself be vulnerable and comforted by family and friends.. and even when terminally ill, he remained fully alive! Thank You Random House, Netgalley, and Paul ( and Lucy), Kalanithi"

12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2795921-justin,Rating 5 out of 5,"I read this almost two months ago and realized I never reviewed it. When I finished the book, I just couldn't review it. It's a small book, but it's powerful. I didn't shed any tears at the end of it, but I remember sitting there physically shaking and feeling really numb and tingly. A book has never impacted me that way before, and I'm not even sure why I read the book in the first place since I knew what I was getting myself into. Wait, I know why I wanted to read it. It was very therapeutic for me. I don't want to pull back the curtain too far on my life, but I've seen the havoc cancer causes out of nowhere in people's lives. People very close to me. I've held my grandmother's hand as she took her last breath after battling pancreatic cancer. My grandfather wasn't far behind her thanks to cancer in his lungs and throat. My dad has been battling colon cancer for the last two years. He's up and down. I think chemo does more bad than good. It's definitely taken its toll on him, but he's fighting. All this cancer and death hitting so close to home left me in this weird phase two years ago where I got to learn what a panic attack feels like. It's like having a heart attack, but not really, but close. It's scary. I think cancer blasting through my family while I was in the process of trying to move across the country just really shook me up. I still deal with the effects of it sometimes. I think God was just trying to show me there are some things in life I can't control. I can pick my job, my house, what to watch on Netflix, but I have no power over death or cancer or a heart attack or a car crash or any of it. YeahSo this book was helpful. I felt like I really connected with it and it was something I needed to read. You might not have quite the same reaction, but I still highly recommend reading it. Fiction is always great to escape the dark realities of the world we live in, but sometimes confronting those realities head on is extremely beneficial."

This is one of the best medical memoirs I have read. This book tells us about cancer both from a Doctor's perspective and a patient's perspective. Kalanithi's journey from a medical student into a Stanford Neurosurgeon will be an inspiring one for many. But it is the latter half of the book that tells you how to deal with a terminal illness that inspires you the most.

“There is a moment, a cusp, when the sum of gathered experience is worn down by the details of living. We are never so wise as when we live in this moment.”

14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9479701-joseph,Rating 3 out of 5,"Okay, I so wanted to like this very absorbing book more than I did. I am not going to recap it other than to say that Paul came from a privileged background, a very supportive family and an Indian (Asian Tiger) mom. He succumbed to an aggressive form of lung cancer. My own wife died of lung disease (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). Outside of the hospital I was her caregiver for a year and a half. I was the one who made sure she had oxygen, got to her appointments, watched this once vital woman deteriorate, and held her hand in icu when she passed. Unlike Paul and Lucy, we did not stay together out of a sense of obligation because one of us was sick. Unlike Paul and Lucy we did not have an extended family to support us. Unlike Paul and Lucy we adopted. I went through this with her because I loved her. I never thought of another option even though she tried to persuade me once or twice that there might be other options. The book is very well written and Paul had a gift for including just the right amount of medical detail and jargon. He explains things precisely when explication as needed. The book flows smoothly from his childhood through Stanford and then Yale medical school. Paul according to himself is just about the best at whatever he undertakes and again according to himself he always takes care to score one more point than his closest competitor. He catalogues a list of the books he has read -- exclusively Western -- and drops a few favorite quotations from some. Strangely he makes no mention of Indian writing or writers or of the great Kiowa author Scott Momaday who matriculated at Stanford. Kinda too bad Paul did not read Momaday. If he had he might have understood the power and use of words better than he did.He becomes according to himself a wonderful neurosurgeon, probably the best ever although he does not reduce it to that exact description. He is decisive, fast, innovative and just an all around wonderful doctor.If you are getting the impression that he comes across as extremely self centered you broke the code. If you are getting the impression that he comes across as lacking real depth you not only broke the code you read between the lines.The book is very well written and at times absorbing, but it left me wondering, was that all there was to Paul and Lucy?"

‘even if im dying, until i actually die, i am still living.’
this memoir offers a very unique perspective on life and death, science and philosophy.as someone who also studied both literature and neuropsychology, i appreciate and completely relate to pauls outlook on how both are connected forces which drive life. his insights to what makes a life meaningful, the importance of purpose, and seeing humanity in people are good lessons to be taught. while not necessarily groundbreaking ideas at the core, its how he exemplifies these ideas in the context of his life and diagnosis that will serve as a good reminders to others to live life to the fullest.↠ 4 stars"
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15701318-anna,Rating 5 out of 5," ""ALL ORDERS TEND TOWARDS ENTROPY"" This is the story of the perception and management of life and death (both separately and together) of a 36 year old doctor nearing the completion of his neurosurgery training when he got diagnosed with a stage 4 cancer. Being a person on the path of being a surgeon, having a love for books, philosophy, literature, writing and a thirst to know deeper meaning for life, I felt I could understand the author very well, somehow! The parts regarding a surgeon's hectic schedule, the heavy burden of patients' wellness and care and the thorough explanation of surgical procedures proved to be like my own normal routine and consequently made me feel more at home with this man's philosophies and researches for whatever he was looking for out there in this whole wide universe!Paul had a passion to fully grab the meaning and purpose of life, death and human existence and this love took him on an adventurous journey first through literature, then through medicine and finally both!“Years ago, it had occurred to me that Darwin and Nietzsche agreed on one thing: the defining characteristic of the organism is striving.” He found that no matter how much close to a patient a doctor was during his illness, he could never grasp the true meaning of his suffering since he could never be in his shoes!This book shows how fragile life is to spoil the long hours of hard work and fail you in achieving your goals, how unpredictable it can be to divert you from the path that so definitely was leading you towards your dreams just in the previous moment.This book shows how life is to be lived, how death is to be welcomed and how much effort it takes to have the integrity to look them both in the eye, fight with dignity and come out a winner, despite losing your breaths in the battle! Tears welled up in my eyes while reading the part when despite having a weakening body, this man invested enough energy to gain unlimited happiness during the moments of delivery of his daughter. He taught us that vulnerability is not weakness. It takes real strength to reveal your vulnerable side. It is in the weakest moments that a man can be the strongest, never knowing he could endure all that pain.This book opens our eyes to our mortality. That our time in this universe is limited. That love and knowledge are immortal tools that we can use to our aid to make our stay on this planet infinite.Finally this book teaches us how the pain and suffering could be reduced by the undying love, affection and care of one's family. That life is not lived in years. Even in the smallest amount of time, we can create valuable and immortal memories.“Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.” The book is written in simple and honest language yet it touches the deepest parts of heart and mind. Being written by a man who had a limited time frame and a vast knowledge and understanding of the human miseries and their connections with the beginning, mid and end of the story called life, I would not like to judge it harshly. Just having the courage enough to write a book with such influence on readers is a feat worth praising!The sadness I felt, after knowing that we have lost one of the best neurosurgeons and a visionary, affectionate human being who could do so much with his talent and compassion to reduce the sufferings of the world, was immense!""Only 0.0012% of 36-year-olds get lung cancer. ""The dilemma???He had to be the one!5 starts!Highly recommended!"

I'm sorry that the world lost a clearly brilliant, passionate neurosurgeon. But just once, I'd like to read a cancer memoir from someone without privilege. Without education, without wealth, without the best treatment in the world at their fingertips. I want to hear of the person who is NOT going to leave a legacy behind, whose ego is not so ballooned that the foreword describes their mediocre prose as ""spun gold."" I have learned nothing, except that some people's stories get told, and many times those are not the stories I want to hear. "

22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48024027-janet-gould,Rating 2 out of 5,"I expect the author was actually a much nicer guy than he comes across as being in this book. However throughout the book he tells us again and again that he was the smartest kid in school, that he got into Stanford AND Yale and was the best med student and the best med students become surgeons and the best surgeons become neurosurgeons, so of course he became a neurosurgeon. And then... became the BEST neurosurgeon - chief resident at a top hospital. And wait there's more: he's also well- read and illustrates this by throwing in frequent quotes from literature. It is unfortunate the author spent so much time cataloging his accomplishments when actually he had an interesting story: a young man thought he had most of his life ahead of him and was suddenly faced with a mortal illness. A more introspective story might have explored how this sudden reversal of fortune affected his inner life, relationships, and values. But this is not an introspective story and only touches on such things in a very superficial way. Perhaps the most interesting question here arises from the backstory. Why does a young man when faced with a deadly disease remain narcissistically focussed on his own accomplishments?

24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-always-pouting,Rating 4 out of 5,"Paul Kalanithi is thirty six and so close to finishing his training as a neurosurgeon when he finds out he has stage IV lung cancer. As an undergraduate Kalanithi studied English literature and his love of reading and writing had been a constant through out his life. He had always felt that when he was older he would like to write and had decided to focus on neurosurgery for now, where he could make a bigger difference by saving people's lives. All his hopes and dreams for the future were suddenly unrealistic as an upper limit of a handful of years was put onto his life. Kalanithi pens this memoir, dealing with the struggles of facing death and having to go from being able to save others lives to now be the one staring down mortality. The writing was excellent but reading this memoir was so depressing. Just the fact that someone so brilliant was going to die and not be able to keep contributing when they clearly had so much to offer. I was disappointed by where the book left off but then I read the afterword to find out that he had died before he could even finish the memoir which just made it twenty times worse. Death is inevitable but like Kalanithi acknowledges we don't really think about it as being imminent and so it's not the same as when you're terminal and trying to make peace with dying. I just found it so hard to read him struggling to make sense of how to best use the rest of his time especially since there was no way for him to know how limited it really was. Also the fact that he didn't get to see more of his daughter and watch her grow up. It was just depressing honestly, well written but I just felt sad and I don't know what else to say. It just feels unfair because I wish I was even a fraction as smart or eloquent but I'm not but I get to live and he doesnt."

“The thing about lung cancer is that it’s not exotic,” Paul wrote in an email to his best friend, Robin. “It’s just tragic enough and just imaginable enough. [The reader] can get into these shoes, walk a bit, and say, ‘So that’s what it looks like from here…sooner or later I’ll be back here in my own shoes.’

My thoughts a few pages into this book was that I could never write a memoir because then I would have to publish it and it would be as if everyone could have access to my diary. Then my thoughts more than halfway through the book was that to write a memoir, you must have something really awe-inspiring to write about and you must have lived and more importantly, loved.All of Paul's achievements had enlightening moments to them and to me, the biggest uplifting success of Paul was being able to pin down all these moments throughout his challenges, hectic schedules and treatments. He wanted to teach us to ask more questions whether it was in literature or medicine or life but also not get so caught up in the questioning that we forgot to live in the moments with our people. ❤️***first nonfiction in a long time :) please don’t disappoint🤞🏽"

I had to wait a little bit to pull myself together before writing a review of this exquisite book, even though I am tremendously late to the party on this one.""...See what it is to still live, to profoundly influence the lives of others after you are gone, by your words. In a world of asynchronous communication, where we are so often buried in our screens, our gaze rooted to the rectangular objects buzzing in our hands, our attention consumed by ephemera, stop and experience this dialogue with my young departed colleague, now ageless and extant in memory. Listen to Paul.""Paul Kalanithi was, by all accounts, an excellent neurosurgeon, with the potential of being a true guiding force in medicine and science. He spent most of his early adult life seeking knowledge on multiple fronts, from literature and science to philosophy and ethics. When he finally decided to pursue a career in neurology, he wasn't just content to be a doctor—he wanted to understand and identify with his patients fully, to help them and their families adjust to whatever their new reality would be following a diagnosis, an accident, a surgery.""I was pursuing medicine to bear witness to the twinned mysteries of death, its experiential and biological manifestations: at once deeply personal and utterly impersonal.""At the age of 36, Paul was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer. Suddenly his life has transformed him from doctor to patient, not an easy transition for anyone, especially someone as hands-on with patient care as Paul had been. While he and his internist wife Lucy are prepared for the worst, Paul's oncologist has hope, and doesn't allow him to wallow in his diagnosis. If he wants to stop being a neurologist, she tells him, it has to be because he doesn't want to continue or wants to pursue something else—his cancer won't stop him.As he struggles with thoughts of his future, however long that might be, he ponders how to fill that time. Should he continue working in a field that has so richly given back to him, and given him the chance to touch so many lives? What gives a life value, and how can that value be measured? What obligations does he owe his family, his friends, his wife, his infant daughter?""At those critical junctures, the question is not simply whether to live or die but what kind of life is worth living.""
When Breath Becomes Air
 is an intellectual and deeply emotional memoir, written by a young man with so much promise, so much heart, so much empathy. It is both a reflection on coming face-to-face with one's own mortality and a commentary on the responsibility doctors have to help their patients and their families through that same reflection, whether it happens with some warning or suddenly. It is also a love story, of a man and his wife, a man and the child he will never truly know, and a man and his career.You know from the very start of Abraham Verghese's introduction to the book that Paul lost his battle with cancer, yet the end of his life, and the epilogue written by Paul's wife still feel like sucker punches. You mourn a man you probably never knew, but you feel truly blessed he chose as one of his final acts to share his life, his death, and his thoughts with the world, because we are all better for them.""'The thing about lung cancer is that it's not exotic,' Paul wrote in an email to his best friend, Robin. 'It's just tragic enough and just imaginable enough. [The reader] can get into these shoes, walk a bit and say, 'So that's what it looks like from here...sooner or later I'll be back here in my own shoes.' That's what I'm aiming for, I think. Not the sensationalism of dying, and not exhortations to gather rosebuds, but: Here's what lies up ahead on the road.' Of course, he did more than just describe the terrain. He traversed it bravely.""This is a beautiful book, truly a work of art that I won't soon forget. Easily one of the finest books I've read in some time. My thanks to the Kalanithi family, and Paul himself, for this opportunity to view such an exceptional man at such a critical juncture in his life.

I came to know him most intimately when he'd ceased to be."" (Abraham Verghese)And we, for the most part, can actually say the same thing about Paul Kalanithi. We've come to know of him only after he had left this world of ours. Ironically, I write this on March 9th, the one-year anniversary of his passing.Paul Kalanithi: son, husband, father, brilliant surgeon. He was a healer whose very existence gave hope to so many. How can this be? In my humble opinion, I believe that we are here on this earth for the appointed time of our being. We draw no more breath than what is pre-determined by a Higher Being....be it the last, raspy breaths of the elderly or the sole breath of a dying newborn. Paul was here for his personal alloted time.This book is divided into two sections: before cancer diagnosis and after cancer diagnosis. Many have expressed a disconnect after having read this story. Many were looking for the gentle words of the dying in philosophical terms. The little nuggets were indeed there. But the perspective was all Paul's.The beginning of the book was both clinical and procedural. That was Paul revealing his sense of ""being""......what it took to become this focused man of medicine and of science. His steps were measured in the direction of his accomplishments and towards the light of a future that was never meant to be.The second part of the book concentrated on the shifting of his identity from directing physician to the role of dependent patient. His profound knowledge of medicine served him in a limited capacity as he fought against the aggression of the disease. ""But I'd had no idea how hard it would be, how much terrain I would have to explore, map, settle."" Much like the rest of us in our stilted human experience.The Epilogue is beautifully written by his wife, Lucy. She writes: ""his transformation, from life to death, the ultimate transformation that awaits us all.""When Breath Becomes Air should not be taken as a maudlin reading, but one of hope and one of living a life well, no matter what the promise of longevity reveals."
29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas,Rating 4 out of 5,"I enjoyed this memoir and can see why so many people applauded it when it first came out. Paul Kalanithi’s writing is straightforward and evocative at the same time. For a man approaching his own death, he crafted this memoir in a way that doesn’t feel overly sentimental yet still captures the love he has for his profession, his family, and for literature and writing. I felt immersed in several parts of When Breath Becomes Air, ranging from Kalanithi’s journey to discovering neurosurgery as his true passion as well as the raw details he included both about his practice of neurosurgery and his own illness. I feel like contemporary society in the United States can be averse to openly naming, processing, and honoring death, so I appreciated this book for encouraging us to reflect on what actually matters in life beyond everyday stressors or more insignificant worries. When reading When Breath Becomes Air, I thought about my best friends and my own passion for healing work and art.My main critique of this memoir is that at times it felt like Kalanithi was participating in glorifying or giving a pass to toxic work cultures within the field of medicine? For example, at one point he wrote about how he noticed some of his colleagues opting for careers in less stressful medical disciplines like dermatology or radiology. The tone he used in this section of the book felt a bit condescending – I think it’s totally fair for people to want a career where they can live healthy lives physically and mentally, spend time with their friends and families, devote time to hobbies, etc. At one point he wrote about how the difference between a job/career and a calling, and how because he perceived neurosurgery as his calling, he was willing to endure overwork even to the detriment of his health and the quality of his marriage. I felt turned off by this language because I feel like something should be able to be your calling *and* you should be able to live a healthy life outside of that calling too. Overall, a quick and impactful read. While I respect that Kalanithi wrote what felt most authentic for him, I wish he had avoided glorifying overwork in medicine, especially given the worrying rates of mental health problems and deaths by suicide by doctors, including one of Kalanithi’s own former colleagues who he wrote about in this book."
30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8836060-michelle,Rating 5 out of 5,"“When Breath Becomes Air” is not only poignant, touching, and painful -- it is also full of love, insight, courage and humility. I’m thankful Paul Kalanithi found a way to share his love of writing and prodigious talents with the world, especially under such harrowing circumstances. The world is a richer place because of it… And at heart, this is a life-affirming book. It was for me, anyway.Paul expresses, lived, and has shared how meaning can transform tragedy into a deep transcendence of being that shimmers. With meaning and eloquence, he was able to step outside of himself, trapped in his disease for sustained periods of time, and create the side of humanity we can't know. He does so with balance and personal reflection on the value of life and our relationships with others. His realization of patients as people, and about quality of life was profound to me. Though sad, the story never felt manipulative or self-pitying. I couldn’t help but reflect on my life while I was reading this, and I think this is the book's greatest strength. From a distance, it might seem that Paul’s life would be hard to relate to -- Stanford, Yale, Christian dad, Hindu mom, neurosurgery etc.-- but his empathy and insight cut through all that and make him all the more human. This is a memoir that anyone ""ceaselessly striving"" to live with grace, dignity, and accountability will benefit from -- a testimony of the impact of such a life. Paul’ s life-long love and study of literature is evident in the way he uses words to express his thoughts and concepts. His lyricism is in the choice of his words, making it for a very direct, honest, objective narration, yet deep and captivating. As I see his message: we will die, but we can live a meaningful life by giving ourselves to make an impact on others -- by trying to improve those around us by doing good deeds, and by art such as writing. In this way, we may live on, as Paul has managed through this sublime memoir. I found his wife's epilogue particularly touching in describing the last couple of weeks when he could write no more, and his monumental endeavor to write his story. Thinking back as I write this review, I felt the loss of this man. Just like in my own life, there was an impact that required a little time before I could look back and see the gifts of wisdom shared from a unique human being: “With what strife and pains we come into the world we know not, but ’tis commonly no easy matter to get out of it.” "

The tumor had interrupted his speech circuitry, so he could speak only in streams of numbers, but he still had prosody, he could still emote : smile, scowl, sigh. He recited another series of numbers, this time with urgency. There was something he wanted to tell us, but the digits could communicate nothing other than his fear and fury.“Fourteen one two eight,” he pleaded with me, holding my hand. “Fourteen one two eight.”“I’m sorry.”“Fourteen one two eight,” he said mournfully, staring into my eyes. And then I left to catch up with the team.I have seen another example of this kind of language affliction myself. My own mother had vascular dementia and lost the power of language in her last three or four months. And yet she still conversed with us. So she would speak in streams of jumbled syllables which made no sense at all, but they would sound exactly like normal speech – some streams of gibberish sounded just like amusing anecdotes and questions would have a rising inflection – you could tell when she was recounting a wistful ancient memory. In fact you could tell all the emotions of what she was saying, you just couldn’t understand a single word, because she was no longer speaking in words. I think that in her own mind she was making perfect sense. Whether she could understand what we said to her is anyone’s guess.  Her final infirmity taught me a valuable lesson – not all dementia is cruel. Her version was quite kind. She seemed very contented. She never seemed to notice anything was amiss.  Quite the opposite happened to the author of this remarkable memoir. He was a neurosurgeon, he was in his late 30s, just about to be launched into the very peak of a glittering career. He knew exactly what he was looking at when he saw his own CT scans.  I was going through some books cluttering up my to-read shelf and I picked up this one today; I can’t even remember how it got there. From somebody else I think. Not really my kind of thing – a bit morbid, a bit melodramatic, a bit obvious – but once I started I was hooked all the way to the bitter end. He has a beautiful style.I pulled away the fat until the fascia appeared and I could feel the tips of his vertebrae. I opened the fascia and smoothly dissected the muscle away, until only the wide, glistening vertebrae showed up through the wound, clean and bloodless. There’s quite a lot of that. He is as unembarrassed about his own surgical skill as he is about his own cancer and its terrible progression. Some people, I guess, are just fantastic.I agree with everybody else : 5 stars."

34,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil,Rating 4 out of 5,"A very high 4 stars. When Breath Becomes Air is so good and so sad. It's a brief memoir of a life ended way too early. Kalanithi was 35 years old and finishing his training as a neurosurgeon when he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of lung cancer. As he was living out the end of his life, he wrote this brief powerful memoir. In the first section, he describes how he became aware of his diagnosis -- he essentially self diagnosed. In the second section he explains how he decided to become a neurosurgeon -- he wavered between being a writer and a doctor but decided that he wanted to do something tangible that engaged him in the real world -- although he had planned to become a writer later in life. In the third section, he writes about being a patient, his struggle to live a normal life, becoming a father, and his failing health. And the final section is written by his wife after his death – she writes about his death, how he wrote the book and who he was to her. I'm not sure what to say to do justice to this book and to Kalanithi. There's a bit of a stream of consciousness feel to the book. But all the bits and pieces of narrative add up to a very meaningful whole: he writes strong fluid prose, he has a brilliant mind, he conveys his dual love of literature and science, and he has great human insight into life, medicine, dying and death. It makes for a very sad book -- not because Kalanithi is melodramatic or self-pitying – quite the contrary -- but because as I read and savoured his prose and thoughts I couldn't help feeling the sense of a life cut far too short. I can't fathom how he was able to so soberly write this book in the last few months of his life, but I'm grateful I had a chance to read it. Thank you to the publisher and Netgalley for an opportunity to read an advance copy. "

But the numbness reappears the instant I allow the pages to unfold in my memory. The silence which suddenly parts to let these memories seep in and cloud my vision, fills the air. Even as I grapple to make ‘sense’ of what it means to lose a dear, dear one, I, ironically, already know that very ‘sense’ to be ephemeral. No part of my being accepts death; they all adjust the lens to view it as a part of life.Paul was a neurosurgeon by profession, and passion, at Stanford University School of Medicine. Standing at the threshold of seeing his dream come true, one built on a decade and half of relentless academic pursuits and tireless hours at residency, he witnesses a cruel twist of destiny; he is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, just months before his scheduled graduation. A doctor in mind and a fighter in spirit, he battles this uninvited and lethal intruder with immense mettle and equanimity, gaining much wisdom during the course and eventually, surrendering to its inevitability and in a strange, serene way, to its affability.Paul Kalanithi’s memoir is a sublime read. It is a reminder of the transience of life yet an even louder reminder of longevity of deeds and memories. That in little manifestations and significant decisions, in careless words and sombre confessions, we continue to live, long after we are gone. He wrote most parts of this book during his last months in debilitating pain and treatment but he couldn’t have sounded more balanced and calm. The impact of this book is not in his sage-like, detached, professional treatment of his grave illness but in its earnestness; earnestness to detect vulnerabilities and find a path through them that eventually stands meaningful. Somewhere around page 161, he talks about the much quoted five stages of grief – denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. And along with them, his case, with aberration, wherein the cycle was embraced in reverse order by him. From accepting his fate to slipping into depression at not being able to pursue his career, to adamantly cherry-picking duties at hospital, if only to be closer to his first love to getting angry at his lost mobility and scarred vitality, to finally, plunging into his surgeon duties with a vengeance, agonizingly shoving his deteriorating body aside, Paul exhibits an incredibly hungry mind and dedicated soul. As a reader, I have, many times, felt the palliative effect of books. During my times of distress, I have seen my sorrows and melancholy unloading on the sturdy and wise shoulders of authors and their verses. Thus, I could fathom the strength Paul drew from Beckett and Eliot, Forster and Nietzsche. And most importantly, from his wife, Lucy. A doctor herself, how crushing it would have been for her to keep a good head and not forsake the glimmer of hope in the light of her professional inferences. But as Mark Twain says, “The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.”Paul and Lucy Kalanithi did live, in their lovely daughter, Cady. Born sixteen months post Paul’s diagnosis, she had the physical company of her father for eight months only. But she will continue to know his courage and feel his magic every time she will pick this book up. "

It is a memoir about his life and illness, battling stage IV metastatic lung cancer. It was published on January 12, 2016. At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade’s worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naive medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality. What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away?

Facing an impending loss without a foundation of faith to fall back on, I find myself asking, “What is the meaning of life if we’re all just going to die?”Paul Kalanithi answers that question in the most meaningful way possible in his outstanding book. A 36-year- old neurosurgeon, Paul wrestled between medicine and literature as an eventual career. Medicine won out and he was just on the cusp of a stellar trajectory when he was diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer. Paul nurtured a passionate belief in the moral dimensions of his job. He also strongly believed that the relational aspect between people undergirded meaning and that life’s meaning has everything to do with the depth of the relationships we form in our journey. He says this, “The secret is to know that the deck is stacked, that you will lose, that your hands or judgment will slip, and yet still struggle to win …You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which are ceaselessly striving.Just as his surgeon’s scalpel eased disease of the brain and saved lives, his words give reasons for living. The grace with which he navigates his journey – from a top-rated surgical resident to writer to his most important role of all, husband and father of a young daughter – his book is ample testimony to how one life well-lived can continue to create such a great impact.In the foreword by fellow doctor and writer Abraham Verghese, that doctor writes, “He (Paul) wasn’t writing about anything—he was writing about time and what it meant to him now, in the context of his illness.” And in the afterword by his wife Lucy, the meaning of that time becomes even clearer. I felt the sense of having lost a personal friend.Let me make this clear if I haven’t already: this is NOT a self-pitying, manipulative memoir and it is not the reason I’m 5-starring it. It’s a beautifully written, insightful, page-turning book on how we connect as humans and why life – no matter how truncated – is worth living. I will be recommending this strongly to just about everyone in my life."
38,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca,Rating 5 out of 5,"Our shadow panel selection for the Wellcome Book Prize 2017. I first read this book a year and a half ago; when I picked it back up recently, I thought I’d give it just a quick skim to remind myself why I loved it. Before I knew it I’d read 50 pages, and I finished it the next night in the car on the way back from a family party, clutching my dinky phone as a flashlight, awash in tears once again. (To put this in perspective: I almost never reread books. My last rereading was of several Dickens novels for my master’s in 2005–6.)What struck me most on my second reading is how Kalanithi, even in his brief life, saw both sides of the medical experience. He was the harried neurosurgery resident making life and death decisions and marveling at the workings of the brain; in a trice he was the patient with terminal lung cancer wondering how to make the most of his remaining time with his family.Yet in both roles his question was always “What makes human life meaningful?” – a quest that kept him shuttling between science, literature and religion. In eloquent prose and with frequent scriptural allusions, this short, technically unfinished book narrates Kalanithi’s past (his growing-up years and medical training), present (undergoing cancer treatment but ultimately facing death) and future (the legacy he leaves behind, including his daughter).Looking back once again at the guidelines for the Wellcome Book Prize (“At some point, medicine touches all our lives. Books that find stories in those brushes with medicine are ones that add new meaning to what it means to be human”), When Breath Becomes Air stands out as a perfect exemplar.My original review from October 2015:I’m something of an aficionado of cancer memoirs, a subgenre that appeals for family history reasons but also because I appreciate stories lived right on the knife edge of life and death. Here’s one I would recommend to anyone for the beauty of its prose – a fine blend of literature and medicine – and the simple yet wholehearted picture of a life cut short.Paul Kalanithi was 36 and just completing his neurosurgery residency in Stanford, California when he was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer that did not respond well to treatment. It came as a complete surprise and set the young surgeon’s life on a new course. He and his coterie of doctors managed his symptoms so he could operate for as long as he could, but when the time came he knew he wanted to devote his last year to writing this memoir. In addition, he would get a brief, sweet taste of fatherhood: he and his wife Lucy, also in the medical field, decided to have a child.Kalanithi grew up the son of Indian immigrants in Arizona. “I was driven less by achievement than by trying to understand, in earnest: What makes human life meaningful?” he recalls. Degrees in English literature and human biology were disparate attempts to find an answer. Like Henry Marsh (Do No Harm), he has a surgeon’s knowledge of the anatomy of reasoning, but realizes that does not provide a full picture. He recognizes the responsibility of holding others’ lives in the balance, and regrets occasional failures of empathy.“Those burdens are what make medicine holy and wholly impossible: in taking up another’s cross, one must sometimes get crushed by the weight.” It’s intriguing to see religious language in that statement – indeed, Kalanithi saw his work as a calling, and one with moral connotations. Christian imagery shows up repeatedly:Instead of being the pastoral figure aiding a life transition, I found myself the sheep, lost and confused.Openness to human relationality does not mean revealing grand truths from the apse; it means meeting patients where they are, in the narthex or nave, and bringing them as far as you can.When’s the last time you encountered the word “narthex”?! The vocabulary is striking throughout, as in another favorite passage: “A tureen of tragedy was best allotted by the spoonful. Only a few patients demanded the whole at once; most needed time to digest.”Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015. There’s a lovely epilogue from his wife – like Marion Coutts, the author of The Iceberg, she’s more than competent to carry on his story."

که پیش‌تر تبدیل به دوست صمیمی پال شده - بشدت ناراحت کننده و گریه‌آور است و از لحاظ احساسی واکنش فراوانی را برمی‌انگیزاند.بخش سوم که بنظر من تکان‌دهنده‌ترین قسمت کتاب است، پس از مرگ پال توسط همسر او به نگارش درآمده و شامل روزهای پایانی زندگی نویسنده و بخصوص ساعات پایانی با جزئیات دقیق است. خواندن این بخش از کتاب حقیقتا برای من دشوار و رنج‌اور و همراه با اشک فراوان بود. به‌مرگی نویسنده در ساعات پایانی، در حالی که خانواده‌اش دورش جمع گشته‌اند و نوزادش را در آغوش دارد به اندازه‌ی کافی تلخ نیست؟چگونه رو به نابودی خودمان حرکت می‌کنیممرگ سرنوشت محتوم و گریزناپذیر هر موجود زنده‌ای‌ست که دیر یا زود فرا می‌رسد و هر شخص باید به‌تنهایی با آن مواجه گردد. مرگ و نابودی، شخصی‌ترین تجربه‌ی ممکن برای هر انسانی‌ست، زیرا مرگِ هرکس مطلقا متعلق به خود اوست. زمانی که انسان می‌میرد قادر نیست تجربه‌اش از این اتفاق را با کسی در میان بگذارد، زیرا آن تجربه هم همرا با فرد نابود می‌گردد. از دیدگاه هایدگر زمانی فرد اصالت وجودی پیدا می‌کند که از قطعیت مرگ قریب‌الوقوع خود آگاهی کامل پید�� کرده و رابطه‌ای نزدیک با میرندگی خود پیدا کند. در این صورت فرد آگاه می‌شود که زمان تنها به روزها و سال‌هایی میان تولد و مرگ خلاصه می‌شود و تقسیم‌بندی رایج زمان بصورت خطی، یعنی گذشته، اکنون و آینده فریب ذهنی‌ای بیش نیست. اگر ما زندگی را به صورت خطی تقسیم‌بندی کنیم، ناخودگاه دل به نقطعه‌ای خاص از زمان آینده می‌بندیم و اینچنین وجودی نااصیل را تجربه می‌کنیم. بدین جهت است که آینده را نباید بعدتر از گذشته درنظر داشت و گذشته را قبل‌تر از اکنون. ما در تمام طول زندگی در حال نقشه کشیدن برای آینده هستیم، در حالی مرگ همواره در نزدیکی‌مان ایستاده و این تلاش بیهوده را دنبال می‌کند. این نقشه کشیدن و خود را در زمانی مجسم کردن که هنوز فرانرسیده، همواره حرکتی رو به نابودی‌مان است، زیرا مرگ در نقطه‌ی مشخصی از حیاتمان، واقعیتی گریزناپذیر است و خنده‌دار اینجاست که ما در این برنامه‌ریزی خطی، همواره امکان مرگ را نادیده می‌انگاریم، گویی زمان کافی را در اختیار داریم تا به تمام اهدافمان برسیم. این دقیقا بلایی‌ست که بر سر پال آمد و ما نیز هم یک نقد - نظریه دکتر راسدکتر کوبلر راس نظریه‌ی معتبری در باب چگونگی مواجهه فرد بیمار با مرگ قطعی‌اش را در کتاب \پایان راه: پیرامون مرگ و مردن مطرح کرده است که اتفاقا در این کتاب پال کالانیتی هم به آن اشاره کرده است. نظریه بطور خلاصه از این قرار است که وقتی فرد بیمار از بیماری و مرگ قریب‌الوقوع خویش آگاه می‌شود، به ترتیب پنج مرحله‌ی انکار- خشم - چانه‌زنی - ناامیدی - پذیرش را طی می‌کند تا سرانجام به مرگ خویش رضایت دهد. در مرحله‌ی انکار که اولین مرحله از سیر پذیرش مرگ است، بیمار مشکل خود را به شیوه‌های گوناگونی انکار می‌کند. از عدم پذیرش نتایج تا رها کردن درمان و عدم مراجعه بیمارستان و اعلام اینکه حال عمومی‌اش خوب است و چیزهایی از این قبیل. در مرحله‌ی دوم با شکل گرفتن این سوال در ذهن فرد که ""چرا من؟"" خشم شدیدی در ذهن بیمار شکل گرفته و به شیوه‌های مختلف فرافکنی می‌شود. بیمار در سومین مرحله سعی در چانه‌زنی جهت خریدن وقت بیشتر برای زنده ماندن دارد. مثلا داروهای جدید، درمان‌های جدید، متوسل شدن به انواع معجزات و باورها و چیزهایی که امید به زنده ماندن را دل بیمار روشن نگاه دارد. بیمار در مرحله چهارم از تمام وعده و وعید‌های درمانی ناامید شده و رو به افسردگی عمیقی می‌رود. ممکن است ساعت‌ها مشغول گریه باشد، خاطرات گذشته را با زاری مرور کند و نزدیکانش را بطلبد. اما مرحله‌ی نهایی که آرام‌ترین و ترسناک‌ترین (به باور من) مرحله است، فرد مرگ قریب‌الوقوع خود را کاملا پذیرفته و قدم به قدم بطور پیوسته به درون خویش عقب‌نشینی می‌کند. فرد در این مرحله ممکن است تمام کنش‌های غیرحیاتی خود را از دست بدهد و حالت نباتی پیدا کند. البته شدت و مدت زمان هر مرحله در هر بیمار متفاوت است و فردی ممکن است به سرعت از مرحله خشم عبور کرده اما تا مدتی پیش از مرگ روی مرحله افسردگی متوقف بماندپال کالانیتی در جایی از کتاب به این نظریه اشاره می‌کند و می‌گوید ""من در واقع این مراحل را وارانه و بطور کامل طی کردم"". که این موضوع مطلقا نادرست است. البته از بیماری که به سوی مرگ می‌رود و بشدت در حال دست و پا زدن است تا معنایی برای زندگی کوتاه خود دست و پا کند نمی‌توان هیچ خرده‌ای گرفت، نباید این موضوع را فراموش کرد که نویسنده‌ی کتاب در چه شرایطی آن را به نگارش در آورده است. از نظر من هنگامی که کالانیتی در حال نگارش این کتاب بود هنوز در مرحله‌ی سوم، یعنی چانه‌زنی به سر می‌برد. از علایم این مرحله می‌توان به انجام کارهایی نظیر نوشتن همین کتاب اشاره کرد که فرد در ناخوداگاه خویش خیال می‌کند تا زمانی که کتاب یا کار خود را به پایان نبرده باشد هنوز برای زندگی فرصت است. تنها در هفته‌ی پایانی است که کالانیتی وارد مرحله‌ی پذیرش می‌شود، آنجا که کودک خود را در آغوش می‌گیرد و منتظر لحظه‌ی نهایی می‌ماند کلام آخردر نهایت در مورد کتاب باید بگویم که کتاب خواندنی‌ای بود و به یکبار خواندن (نه بیشتر) می‌ارزد و بجز گذران وقت، دو نتیجه هم برای خواننده به‌همراه دارد: 1- مرگ‌اندیشی و شاید آگاهی به وجود نااصیل خویش 2- تخلیه احساسینکته‌ی پایانی اینکه خواندن کتاب را به دوستانی که اخیرا عزیزی را از دست داده‌اند (بخصوص بدلیل سرطان) اصلا توصیه نمی‌کنم"
40,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40452101-amanda,Rating 5 out of 5,"When Breath Becomes Air is one of the most beautifully written, heartbreaking, and affecting memoirs I have ever read. Even though the book is incredibly sad, it is ultimately life affirming and worth the emotional investment.At the age of thirty-six, Paul Kalanthi, a doctor nearing the completion of his neurosurgeon training, is diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. This revelation becomes a dividing line in his life, something of a reversal of fortune. Paul goes from being a healthy physician with limitless possibility ahead of him to a sick patient with an uncertain future.Paul's love affair with literature began at an early age. ""Books became my closest confidants, finely ground lenses providing new views of the world."" Fearing that her son would not receive an adequate education in the small Arizona town where his father opened a cardiology practice, Paul's mother supplemented with endless literary classics. Paul, convinced that he would not go into medicine, decides to major in English literature but also completes a degree in human biology because of his fascination with the brain. ""Literature provided a rich account of human meaning; the brain, then, was the machinery that somehow enabled it."" After completing a Master's degree in English literature and wanting to discover where biology, morality, literature, and philosophy intersect, Paul chooses to apply to medical school. ""Words began to feel as weightless as the breath that carried them."" He longed for a direct experience. He selects neurosurgery because for him it was truly a calling.After the cancer diagnosis, Paul struggles with answering the philosophical questions that plague him. ""The tricky part of illness is that, as you go through it, your values are constantly changing. You decide you want to spend your time working as a neurosurgeon, but two months later you may feel differently...Death may be a one-time event, but living with terminal illness is a process."" Paul never claims to have the answers, but he perseveres and continues to live. Paul and his wife Lucy even decide to have a baby together. He goes back to the OR until he is no longer able to practice and then dedicates himself to writing this book. Unfortunately, Paul lost his battle in March of 2015, two years after his diagnosis. I am sure different people take different things from this book, but I was captivated by Paul's love of literature. He even credited literature for bringing him back to life during his first course of treatment. Paul's words are so eloquent, and frankly, I had to restrain myself not to quote the entire book. After learning of the cancer, Paul joked with a friend, ""The good news is I've already outlived two Brontës, Keats, and Stephen Crane. The bad news is that I haven't written anything."" Well, Paul Kalanthi did leave behind a powerful work of literature that I highly recommend.Indulge me for one final quote:In the end, it cannot be doubted that each of us can see only a part of the picture. Human knowledge is never contained in one person...It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete. And truth comes somewhere above all of them."

In the second part, we are invited into a time of his life that is heartbreaking, tragic, filled with bewilderment and pain. It also overflows with wisdom and Dr. Kalanithi’s moving quest for meaning; a quest he began at an early age and one that guided him throughout his life.A neurosurgeon and neuroscientist who won awards and whose work was sought after by many institutions as well as individuals, Dr. Kalanithi chose a path that was both intensely specialized and emotionally draining. Or, to be more precise, this path chose him; for Dr. Kalanithi, it was a calling.Brutally long hours requiring a sharp focus where a millimeter can separate life from death, triumph from tragedy instilled in me a completely renewed view of what is required as a surgeon. I cannot even imagine the degree of energy and inner resources that would be required to accomplish the work he did.Reading about his passage into and through the world of medicine and about the extent of what he called his ‘moral responsibility’ to each patient was enlightening. How he learned to become more than just a surgical machine, to become directly involved in his patient’s pre-surgery care as well as after-surgery care is inspiring and, in a sense, an instruction booklet for developing integrity and humility.The second part of the book takes us on a journey where we share in his battle with cancer. He was diagnosed with metastatic Stage IV lung cancer in May 2013, and he died in March 2015, less than a month away from his 38th birthday. His last wish was for his wife to ensure that his book was published, and so it was in January 2016.This journey we embark on with Dr. Kalanithi is an epic journey, and although I finished reading this book last night, the impact of all that I read kept me awake into the small hours of the morning. I feel as though I had experienced the entire range of human emotion while reading this novel, and I learned so much about both the frailty of human life and its heroic strength.This is a book that, even more than usual, will be experienced differently by each person. There are many nuggets of wisdom in it, and as with all wisdom, it comes to each of us only in the proportion that we are ready to receive it. It is what makes this novel such an important book – one that I highly recommend to everyone."

Dr. Paul Kalanithi was a neurosurgical resident entering his final year of training when he was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. This memoir is Paul's story for his daughter, Cady, who was 8 months old when he passed away, just 22 months after his cancer diagnosis. Among other things, Paul writes about his career, his love for his family, his views on the 'doctor and patient relationship' and his eventual transistion from doctor to patient. Something that really stood out for me in the book was when Paul explained that as a doctor, you study and learn all the exact descriptions and details of symptoms and illnesses and diseases, but you don't actually ""know"" what it truly ""feels"" like for the patient until you become one. You spend so much time advising patients about what to expect and how an illness may progress, how treatment may feel or what side effects you may get, but you don't TRULY KNOW how it feels to be in their shoes.The Epilogue, written by Paul's wife, was a very beautiful finish to the book. I shed quite a few tears throughout this book, but that Epilogue had me sobbing. Publishing this book was one of Paul's last requests to his wife and family before he died. How wonderful that Paul's inspiring story gets to live on forever through this beautiful book!"

Oh what more this brilliant man could have accomplished!Paul's writing is straight forward and to the point, and wife Lucy does a wonderful job with the epilogue and follow through to fulfill her husband's request for publication.A sad, but memorable read. Daughter Cady will be so proud of her father."
44,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28854579-glenn-sumi,Rating 4 out of 5,"By now I’m sure you’ve all heard about this book by the young Dr. Paul Kalanithi, who, in his mid-30s, was completing his training as a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist when he was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. At the time, he and his wife Lucy, also a physician, were contemplating having children. Universities were wooing him. The future was all mapped out, years of hard work about to pay off.And then he got the news about his cancer. Suddenly, he had to reassess his life and think: How do I want to spend the rest of my time, however long that may be?One of his long-term goals was to become a writer. And before he died in March 2015 he asked his wife (and now mother of his child) and parents to make sure this book – alas, incomplete at the time of his death – got published. And this is the result, a brief but powerful and remarkable volume.The book, complete with prologue and (written by Lucy) moving epilogue, is divided into two parts. The first recounts moments from Kalanithi’s childhood, his early love of literature (he studied both literature and biology as an undergrad) and his discovery of his calling as a physician. The second deals with his illness. For the most part, Kalanithi’s writing is clear and earnest, and there are some surprising moments. At one point during his pre-med years at Stanford he was so poor that he squatted for a time in an empty dormitory. He quotes a lot of literature, especially Joyce and Beckett, but I wish he had explored in more depth what he got from books.It feels churlish to critique the writing of such a multi-talented man who never got to finesse the manuscript in book form with an editor, but surely someone at Random House could have made some of these sentences more graceful: How little do doctors understand the hells through which we put patients. You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving. Our relationship was still deep in meaning, a shared and evolving vocabulary about what mattered. If human relationality formed the bedrock of meaning, it seemed to us that rearing children added another dimension to that meaning.I had to look up “asymptote,” and I wish an editor had tweaked that awkward word “relationality.”The second half of the book is much richer, because it’s here that Kalanithi is forced to dig deep and ponder big questions. Here he is questioning his identity:Because I wasn’t working, I didn’t feel like myself, a neurosurgeon, a scientist – a young man, relatively speaking, with a bright future spread before him. Debilitated, at home, I feared I wasn’t much of a husband for Lucy. I had passed from the subject to the direct object of every sentence of my life. In fourteenth-century philosophy, the word patient simply meant “the object of an action,” and I felt like one. As a doctor, I was an agent, a cause; as a patient, I was merely something to which things happened.That last observation is simple yet profound. Witnessing his rapid maturation is inspiring and, in the end, makes you reflect on your own priorities. His final words, about his young daughter, are so wise and generous they'll make you tear up. And Lucy’s bittersweet epilogue puts her husband's writing in perspective. She knows the book feels unfinished, and that it doesn’t capture Kalanithi's sense of humour and other qualities. But sometimes, we can intuit, there’s not time for everything. Let’s be grateful for what we do have, not what we don’t."

What the...?!? Anyway, dù sao thì ai chửi cứ chửi còn sách nào mình thích mình nói thích còn không thích thì không ai bịt miệng mình được, nên mình vẫn tiếp tục viết nhảm ở đây thoai.Khi Hơi Thở Hóa Thinh Không là một quyển sách được viết bởi một bác sĩ và tiến sĩ về phẫu thuật thần kinh người Mỹ gốc Ấn. Và là một quyển sách được tặng, bởi các bạn bên Omega Book. Đang suy nghĩ có nên đưa review lên các trang khác không nhưng nghĩ quá làm biếng nên tạm thời viết đại những gì mình nghĩ sơ qua ở đây.Phần đầu của Paul kể về hành trình đi đến cái chết của mình một cách khá trung tính và cẩn trọng. Vì là người làm khoa học, có lẽ anh hạn chế hết mức có thể những suy nghĩ chủ quan không được suy xét, và phản chiếu lại cả hành trình của mình bằng con mắt của một nhà khoa học, vừa làm bác sĩ vừa làm bệnh nhân. Cách tường thuật của anh có lẽ không hấp dẫn với một số người, riêng với bản thân mình nó lại đưa ra một số góc nhìn gợi suy nghĩ.Paul là một người luôn đau đáu về cuộc sống, về những câu hỏi mang tính chất muôn thuở của loài người, như việc làm thế nào để sống một cuộc sống có ý nghĩa, đặt mình vào vị trí nào, hoàn cảnh nào để mình làm được điều mình muốn làm nhất, phát huy tốt nhất những tư chất bên trong mình và sống đúng với cái bản tính người trong mình. Anh đã lựa chọn kề cận với cái chết, đối mặt với nó hằng ngày để tìm hiểu bản chất của sự chết, từ đó tự tìm lời giải cho việc nên sống thế nào. Và rốt cuộc, chính lựa chọn đó đã khiến anh phải trả những cái giá đắt đỏ.Dĩ nhiên sách không đưa ra lời giải cho những câu hỏi. Không có một câu trả lời nào. Toàn bộ quyển sách là những dòng hồi tưởng và suy ngẫm. Về việc cái gì là thực sự quan trọng trong đời. Anh, cũng như mình, như nhiều người khác trong đời, nỗ lực hết sức và điêu cuồng chạy đua để tiến tới một cái đỉnh trong sự nghiệp của mình, cho đến khi đạt được đến nó, thì cảm thấy mình đã phải trả giá bao nhiêu. Mình đồ rằng chính cái lối sống quá căng thẳng và không lành mạnh của một bác sĩ phẫu thuật thần kinh đã khiến Paul bị bệnh nặng, nhưng một lần nữa sau khi giảm bệnh anh lại lựa chọn trở về phòng mổ, quay lại guồng xoáy làm việc điên cuồng đó, rồi bệnh phát triển mạnh hơn khiến anh qua đời một thời gian không lâu sau đó. Mình không phản đối lựa chọn của anh, mặt khác mình nghĩ mình hiểu một phần chuyện đó. Khi người ta cho rằng đó là điều đem lại ý nghĩa cho cuộc đời mình, khi họ vẫn muốn đạt được tới cái đỉnh của một quá trình mà từ lâu họ đã theo đuổi, thì có lẽ việc nỗ lực đến chết để có nó sẽ đem tới những điều gì đó cho họ trong quá trình làm điều đó. Nhưng quay lại với mình, nếu mình rơi vào tình huống đó, mình không chắc mình có muốn làm vậy hay không.Mình phải mổ xẻ một chút về tiểu sử tác giả vì nó có liên hệ với bản thân mình. Paul có một nền tảng khá đa dạng. Anh tốt nghiệp với bằng cử nhân về sinh học người, có hai bằng thạc sĩ, một về văn học Anh, một về Lịch sử và triết học khoa học, y học. Rồi anh chọn đi theo chuyên môn về y học. Trong suốt quyển sách, ta nhận thấy rõ ý thức của anh về tác dụng của văn học trong đời sống, về khao khát được viết và trở thành một người viết của anh, nhưng anh đã chọn cống hiến hết mình cho y học. Mình nghĩ rằng Paul là một bác sĩ giỏi, một bác sĩ xuất sắc. Nhưng đó là vì kết quả của những nỗ lực phi thường chứ không phải tự nhiên đã giỏi sẵn. Xuyên suốt quyển sách, ta có thể thấy những lựa chọn của một con người đóng góp vào việc hình thành nên con người đó ra sao.Điều khiến mình suy tư, là Paul đã chọn khoa học. Dù anh thỏa mãn nhất định với lựa chọn của mình, anh vẫn chưa tìm thấy lời giải cho câu hỏi then chốt của mình. Khoa học mà nói tự thân nó vẫn có nhiều câu hỏi lớn của tra lời được. Và những người làm khoa học, không khéo thì lại kéo mình vào một cuộc đua, khó hơn, căng thẳng hơn và vô đạo đức hơn. Rốt cuộc thì người ta tìm thấy ý nghĩa của đời mình trong điều gì mới được chứ? Mình tự hỏi mình những câu hỏi này, bởi mình đang trong ngưỡng cửa của sự lựa chọn tương tự như vậy. Chọn dấn thân vào con đường học thuật? Hay chọn cống hiến bản thân cho sự nghiệp văn chương? Mình đã rời thế giới kinh doanh để theo đuổi điều mình cho là có ý nghĩa. Mình không muốn rời một đường đua này để rồi lại rơi vào một đường đua khác. Một điều khiến mình cảm thấy yêu mến quyển sách và tác giả của nó, là những lựa chọn về đạo đức trong lúc làm nghề. Anh không giấu đi những mặt tối trong lĩnh vực y học, và những tường thuật cố gắng trung thực của anh cho thấy anh đã nỗ lực để giữ vững lương tri và đạo đức nghề nghiệp của mình. Paul là một người bình thường, lựa chọn làm những điều phi thường. Và Paul là một người từ tế, vì anh lựa chọn làm điều tử tế. "

Most lives are lived with passivity toward death -it's something that happens to you and those around you.At the age of thirty-six neurosurgeon, Paul Kalantihi was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. He suspected he had cancer. He had been experiencing excruciating back pain, was fatigued and losing weight. After his diagnosis, he went from being a brilliant doctor to being a patient struggling to live. How hard must it have been for him to have all that knowledge and experience to go from being a healer to someone who could not be healed. His writing was beautiful and eloquent. He not only had medical degrees, he also had a M.A. from Stanford University in English Literature. He wrote this book while undergoing treatment in order to live. A doctor and a writer. It was very fitting that another doctor and Author - Abraham Verghese wrote the forward to this book. If I were a writer of books, I would compile a register, with a comment, of the various deaths of men: he who should teach men to die would at the same time teach them to live. - Michel de Montaigne ""That to Study Philosophy Is to Learn to Die""This book is a very emotional, beautiful and sad memoir of a man living while dying. What gives meaning to our lives? How to measure a life well lived? When to stop working"" Should one have a child? How hard should one fight? This book is about Paul's life, his struggles, his acceptance and his impact on the lives of his loved ones. He showed tremendous grace during what was the most physically and emotionally challenging time of his life.From Dr. Abraham Verghese's prologue to the epilogue written by Paul's wife, Lucy, this book is more than just a memoir. It is a beautiful labor of love. The writing is wonderful and heartbreaking.See all my reviews at www.openbookpost.com "

Paul Kalanithi ’99 M.A. ’00 was an instructor in Stanford’s department of neurosurgery and a fellow at the Stanford Neurosciences Institute. At the pinnacle of his training, Stage IV lung cancer happens. The title foretells the memoir's ending. So, this is not a mystery nor is there suspense. This novel is about a man's honest search for meaning in life in his journey toward the grave. So, not light fare but it's really touching and well written. The memoir was written in the last year of the Paul's life and was unfinished because of the progression of his cancer. This is his message to all of us, so we can walk in his shoes before we have to walk it in our own. His wife provides an afterward to shed light on her husband and what he might have written. Skip the Forward. I found that tedious. But the memoir gives you a terrific insight of the reality of being a doctor vs. the fantasy that most have when choosing to become one. An tremendous insights about how to live a rewarding life in the presence of death.Does he find meaning in life? He answers the question in his own way. I think all of us ask the big questions: why am I here? Is my life meant to make a difference? Are we just passing molecules in the billion-year time line of the universe? If you ever thought of being a doctor and/or you ever wanted to answer the BIG questions, this is a great memoir for you."
49,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-mridula,Rating 4 out of 5,"In the Indian epic Mahabharata, there is a sequence where Yudhishtira, the eldest of the Pandava princes, is having a dialogue with a yaksha (a supernatural being). The yaksha asks: What is the most surprising thing in the world? to which the prince replies:""Everyday, living beings go to the abode of the God of Death. Yet even seeing this, the remaining wants to live on for ever. What can be more surprising than this?"" It is a fact that even after being aware of our mortality, we never think about it. Maybe it's a survival requirement, to avoid being in a permanent state of fatalism or anxiety. But the fact remains that each and every one of us is on the death row - only the date of execution is unknown. So we dream, make plans, and enjoy life without ever thinking of it coming to an end - like Paul Kalanithi, the author of this book, did.At age thirty-six, I had reached the mountaintop; I could see the Promised Land, from Gilead to Jericho to the Mediterranean Sea. I could see a nice catamaran on that sea that Lucy, our hypothetical children, and I would take out on weekends. I could see the tension in my back unwinding as my work schedule eased and life became more manageable. I could see myself finally becoming the husband I’d promised to be. Having finished his gruelling residency as a neurosurgeon, Paul is looking out to a bright future with his wife Lucy and their children to be - he is intent on saving his marriage which is almost on the rocks because of his punishing work schedule, and settling somewhere with a plum job. The only thing is, he has to get rid of this nagging back pain...... the nagging pain, which turns out to be lung cancer.Paul thus plummets from the pinnacle to the valley - from doctor, to terminal patient.The lung cancer diagnosis was confirmed. My carefully planned and hard-won future no longer existed. Death, so familiar to me in my work, was now paying a personal visit. Here we were, finally face-to-face, and yet nothing about it seemed recognizable. Standing at the crossroads where I should have been able to see and follow the footprints of the countless patients I had treated over the years, I saw instead only a blank, a harsh, vacant, gleaming white desert, as if a sandstorm had erased all trace of familiarity. Thus arrived on the waste land of the spirit (the frequent references to T. S. Eliot are not coincidental), Paul sits back and takes stock of his life. What has he done so far, what can he do with the remaining time he has? Initially assured that his cancer is not progressing fast, he decides go back into surgery as planned earlier. He also decides to start a family, and accordingly stores his sperm in a sperm bank in anticipation of the possible side effects of chemotherapy. But without warning, his disease flares up - and Paul is left with no option but to withdraw into his role as the terminal patient: and write this memoir.""When Breath Becomes Air"" is a fascinating account by a person cursed (or blessed) to stand on both sides of the doctor-patient dyad. Paul evaluates his actions as a doctor through the lens of a terminal patient.If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining? Whatever life he has lived in the short span that fate, god, or blind chance (take your pick) had given him, Paul puts on the dissecting table, like the excellent surgeon he is, and holds up the different parts for the scrutiny of his readers. The result is an absorbing and heartbreaking tale of a brave and good human being and a sincere professional.We had assumed an onerous yoke, that of mortal responsibility. Our patients’ lives and identities may be in our hands, yet death always wins. Even if you are perfect, the world isn’t. The secret is to know that the deck is stacked, that you will lose, that your hands or judgment will slip, and yet still struggle to win for your patients. You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving. In other words - just do your karma.***Paul Kalanithi died without completing this book. But in a way, this unfinished manuscript with an epilogue by his wife Lucy is perfect in its incompleteness. Paul's narrative ends with his message to his eight-month old daughter, as he holds her in his hands:When you come to one of the many moments in life where you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing. One more quote before I end this review: this time from Lucy. It shows us Paul the man; sick and dying, yet with his beautiful humanity intact.At home in bed a few weeks before he died, I asked him, “Can you breathe okay with my head on your chest like this?” His answer was “It’s the only way I know how to breathe.” ***Thank you, Paul Kalanithi. When the Pingala Keshini comes for me one day, I hope I will be able to meet her with as much fortitude as you did.------Pingala Keshini: The representation of death as a loathsome woman with reddish-brown hair, in some Indian alchemical texts."

It is odd that a book on such a serious subject could make me feel at peace. We are, most of us, apprehensive about death. But the author’s life is a testament to his attitude about life and his transition to the end of his life. Paul Kalanithi was a surgeon who, after years and years of training, would finally be doing his life’s work. But when he was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer, the doctor became the patient. The book concerns both his life before and after the diagnosis. What shines through here is the positive way he and his wife and family faced this unbeatable foe. There are so many lessons to be learned here. I listened to the audio version of the book, which ended with an epilogue written by Kalanithi’s wife. The strength and wisdom expressed by these two people are exceptional. Highly recommended."
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12965962-dee,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is one of those books that's difficult to give a poor rating to. Does a substandard review criticise the subject matter, the style, a life? In this case, I found the style of writing tedious, I'm a voracious reader but the flow of my reading pace was often broken in looking up a word here or there as Paul used quite, we'll be honest, pretentious words and references which made him harder to relate to. He wanted to come across as well educated and intelligent, and yes he did, however, it's difficult to form a connection with people of a lower education (which I imagine is the vast majority of readers!). Even though the subject matter, Paul's cancer,is so personal and relatable to so many, you never feel that connection or humanness to Paul. There's little to no vulnerability in his writing. He's factual and rational, which makes sense as he was a doctor but in order to connect to the reader there needs to be that vulnerability, that rawness. Throughout the whole book I could not form an attachment to him, however in just one chapter I connected with his wife. He seemed to distance himself, talking philosophically instead of personally, prose instead of reality, never being straight and open, rather using someone else's words to express himself. I would much rather have gotten to know the man rather than have many sections of the book taken up by references to other works, it highlights a lack of expression, unable to voice it himself, he expressed himself through others. That itself is no harm but not when writing an autobiography. Paul died and that is incredibly devastating for his family and friends, this review means no disrespect, this may be an unpopular opinion, but I believe that even though he died from cancer, I should not let that colour my opinion of this book. I know the subject matter is his life and illness, but the style of writing was too contrived, it just didn't flow well. I can understand I may not be the most intelligent of people, but I'm not an idiot, I still needed to look up my fair share of the archaic and obscure words. Overall, I found the medical side of things interesting, as that is my profession, but I wouldn't read When Breath Becomes Air again and I wouldn't recommend it to family or friends. I do extend my sympathies to Paul's family's for their loss."

I'm not sure I even need to acknowledge the brilliance, ambition, tenacity, curiosity, and endurance this man possessed or the fact that he wrote in a way that felt conversational and genuine, even when discussing procedures of the brain and medical school examples well outside most people's normal realm. His wife's epilogue was extremely well-written and reduced me to tears, as did his note to his baby daughter. I felt it was a wonderful gift he gave his wife by tasking her with seeing the book through to publication...giving her the opportunity to speak about him and truly keep his memory alive while really focusing on the most positive aspects of his experiences as a husband, a father, and a neurosurgeon.There is much to be learned here about death and living with a terminal illness, but what I came away with from this clearly unfinished memoir is simple: if there were more doctors endeavoring to make the type of connection to their patients that Paul Kalanithi saw as valuable and worked to establish, the state of medical care in this country would be improved in a way that likely cannot be quantified. This man came to realize the value of human connection. He witnessed the effect it had on a patient's ability to accept their situations and their ability to make decisions. He knew the strength of the doctor/patient relationship and he saw the positive outcome of treating the whole patient rather than focusing on just the medical problem to be solved. He was lucky to have an oncologist with the same vision treating him later in the book. Paul Kalanithi has left a great legacy. I hope his generation of doctors/surgeons/educators is paying attention. 5 stars for this beautiful, gentle soul and this book that could change the future of medicine."
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue,Rating 5 out of 5,"I found this to be a very thought provoking, resonant, difficult at times, and oh so human memoir. Very relatable for me, especially in parts that might not be so to other readers. Kalanithi was a resident neurosurgeon, neuroscientist, with aspirations to become a writer later in life when he was diagnosed with a virulent lung malignancy that was to end all of his plans and goals. His memoir becomes a thrashing out of his life before and after, a view of what is this life about. What is Life? What is a Good Life? What is a Good Death? What gives life meaning?Kalanithi uses his own life, his family and incidents from his life as student, intern and surgeon to explore these meanings and seems able to answer these questions for himself. The answers are quite often difficult, sometimes beautiful, often so personal that the reader may not always relate to all the details, but the meaning seemed present for me. Family, love, work, doing the best he could do, striving for success--to relieve suffering as his work dealt in diseases and injuries to the brain, the center of personhood. There is much ego here...but I don't believe a neurosurgeon exists without ego--who would dare to enter someone else's brain with a scalpel otherwise. And there is also the mind of a seeker of beauty -- in his infant child, in nature, his wife, the human body.Kalanithi's wife, Lucy, also a physician, has written an excellent Epilogue in which she sums up the ""end of the story"" and also states that Paul would be unlikely to finish the manuscript for the book due to physical changes. I think this shows somewhat in the book but should not hold anyone back from reading it. It is a powerful exploration of one man's life, as it is ending.As his wife wrote in the Epilogue: He spent much of his life wrestling with the question of how to live a meaningful life, and his book explores that essential territory. This struggle apparently began early in his life and took on new urgency with his illness.Highly recommendedA copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review."

I was waiting for the right time, and that never seemed to come. Timing is important for a read like this, and we all have our connections to books or topics that we feel might contribute to poor timing…If Beth hadn’t had this on her reading list for November and offered a buddy read, I don’t know if I ever would have picked it up. Even though I desperately wanted to read it, I was scared.What happened to Paul Kalanithi could happen to any one of us. A young life full of promise with some uncomfortable symptoms he explained away as stress and body ailments that would come along with one of the most physical and mentally draining times of his life, his last year of residency in neurosurgery.Kalanithi chronicles his early life, the role of his parents in his education, his siblings, his time in college- what he studied and why. He shares many philosophical thinkings he has had and how they contribute to the path he chose. He comes to a fork in the road where he has to choose between being a writer and being a doctor, and he chooses the latter. Why? Not for the fortune and fame because of all the sacrifice it would take to get there; instead, it was a calling for him.Documenting the years of his training, including his residency, and up through his diagnosis to the birth of his daughter, and then his last documented days, I have to say I cried in the beginning, and I cried while reading the last 60 pages. Once Kalanithi knew he was rapidly declining, I could not stop my tears. Then, when his story ends, and his wife, Lucy, completes it, I continued to weep. Paul Kalanithi’s had worked hard to accomplish so many things, and it was all cut devastatingly short. He had a tenderness in his love for his wife, his daughter, his parents and brothers, his friends, but also in how he approached every human he encountered. He never disconnected from the human connection, that each patient was someone’s biggest love.Even though this book ripped me apart, and yes, it made me cry, I’m grateful that I know, and can be inspired by, Paul Kalanithi’s heart.Thank you to Beth for another wonderful buddy read.

“Servere illness wasn’t life altering, it was life shattering. It felt less like an epiphany, a piercing burst of light illuminating what really matters, and more like someone had just firebombed the path forward. Now I would have to work around it.”
Paul Kalanithi is just thirty-six years old when he’s diagnosed with terminal cancer. Before entering the medical field, he debated about whether to follow his love of literature into a teaching and writing field. It’s touching that he got to do both things in his short life, and that his one attempt at authorship would produce this poetic, ethereal ode to a life more than half lived.I’m still processing this book several days after completing it, so excuse my lack of other descriptive words. Books like these make me overwhelmingly sad, so I don’t usually seek them out, but in this case I feel so grateful for having met Paul through his work. Abraham Verghese described coming to know Paul through his prose in the foreword, and I couldn’t have described it any better."

While I believed him, I did not expect myself to cry, for I haven't had the energy to produce tears. I've been preparing (and now recovering) from a hysteroscopy. But as I reached the remaining pages, I was struck by the power and beauty of Paul Kalanithi's words, and later by Lucy Kalanithi's epilogue. The tears rolled down my cheeks with ease, and they wouldn't stop until I closed the book for good. There is no doubt that this book reminded me to live with bravery and integrity as opposed to unrealistic optimism. But I think what I will remember most are the lessons on writing. Paul Kalanithi has taught me that to be a writer, one will have to write in the face of deep tiredness and sorrow. Kalanithi was a testament to this. He was always a writer, and a deep thinker. When he was at his frailest, he continued to write. Now, his written words are perhaps ever more present than the words he once spoke. We think that speech is the most present, and the closest we can get to meaning. But when the speech is done, when the breathing has stopped, all that is left is writing. All that is left are visuals; poems, anecdotes, essays, photos, etc. When Paul's breath became air, his writing became music. His words are composed of the breath and melodies that once lived in him. And what lingers is a tune that will live on forever, traversing the boundaries of breath and air, to become a sincere note that will hold till infinity. Paul's love, compassion, and determination live on. "

So reading this and putting myself in the shoes of someone having to make those tough decisions and be equipped with all that knowledge was a big treat. This book wasn't quite as hard-hitting, philosophical, and sad as I was expecting it to be, but I'm still glad I read it. I was choked up during the epilogue thinking about his young daughter growing up and reading this for the first time. It must be so special for his family. At the same time, anyone could pick this up and see how resilient and admirable Paul was in the face of death, which is why it was a bestseller and won the Goodreads award. I'm definitely gonna be pondering this for a bit."
59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40792319-fabian-councillor,Rating 4 out of 5,"Paul Kalanithi, the author of this touching memoir, died of stage IV lung cancer in March 2015, ten months before the publication of the novel which would not only raise attention to his fate, but also to the general effects of the terrible disease that is cancer (which should never cease to deserve attention; it is a subject too important). When I first opened the pages of this book, what I expected was a clinical description of his disease's course, but Kalanithi surprised me and probably a lot of other people as well.This is a work of reflection. Paul Kalanithi lived for only 37 years, but in the end of his life he was thankful for the experiences he had and the life he was allowed to live, for the woman he married and the career he focused many parts of his life on. His reflections on the illness are touching and moving, but his book is also about his thoughts on doctoring, included many interesting aspects about his time-consuming steps to become a respected doctor and to establish his career as a neurosurgeon. Survived by his wife (who wrote the beautiful afterword to this book) and a daughter, Kalanithi talks about the struggle of first being a doctor treating patients and then, from one day to the next, turning into a patient being treated by doctors. After all, facing mortality is a difficult thing to do for everyone who had to deal with death at a certain point of their lives. And so was it for Kalanithi.I bear a lot of respect for Kalanithi and was incredibly touched by his fate. His prose was not always as natural and flowing as you might wish in a book, but he delivered the best he could, and I am the last person to criticize him for that - especially considering the circumstances under which he wrote these pages. Even more, the book was not as depressing as you might expect in a memoir about cancer.

“You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.”

Paul Kalanithi's words inspired me, his story touched me, and I am grateful for the publication of his book, as what happened to him is so important for so many people.~~~If you are interested in more insight on Kalanithi, you may be interested in this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5u75..."

This is very much the case for me with When Breath Becomes Air.If I had rated it the day I turned the last page, it would have been an easy five stars. The book had me captivated. A brilliant neurosurgeon gets late-stage cancer while still in his 30s and chronicles his journey from being a doctor, to a patient, to a father, to a dying man. Paul Kalanithi was a rare person. The epilogue from his wife had me crying in the Starbucks, and we’re not talking a quiet sort of eye-welling, we’re talking swollen face and muffled sobs. It’s absolutely heartbreaking. Yet here I am a month later, and other than the fantastic epilogue, I don’t remember the book very well. It doesn’t stick. Instead of recalling any of Kalanithi’s descriptions or insights, I am only left with an ephemeral sort of sadness. I feel terrible saying this because the book was so important to Kalanithi and he will never write again. I also feel bad because other GR reviews are filled with elegiac praise and it’s hard to stand apart from a group that you respect. But, in my case, the writing just wasn’t strong enough, and this wonderful man died before he could make it better. "
61,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52535740-blake-crouch,Rating 5 out of 5,"It has been a phenomenal year of great reading, and this memoir stands near the pinnacle of that list. A neurosurgeon in the prime of his life discovers he has Stage 4 lung cancer. And then decides to write about his final two years. As Abraham Verghese writes in the Foreword, ""See what courage looks like."""
62,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is Paul Kalanithi's life story. He relates how he got into neuroscience, his exhausting and life consuming training, his illness, and his eventual transition out of this world into the next.At first, Paul didn't even want to become a surgeon because his own father was one and he saw how hard it was to balance work and family: ""When we did see him, late at night or on weekends, he was an amalgam of sweet affections and austere diktats, hugs and kisses mixed with stony pronouncements ... He had reached some compromise in his mind that fatherhood could be distilled; short, concentrated (but sincere) bursts of high intensity could equal.. whatever it was that other fathers did. All I knew was, if that was the price of medicine, it was simply too high."" pgs 24-25, ebook.But, even though he started out as an English major, Paul's own interests led him towards the profession. He was passionate about medicine and making the best decisions for patients. He was interested in what makes life worth living and how the brain's functions effect quality of life. This is what he had to say after a sobering visit to a home for people who had suffered severe brain injuries as children: ""Only later would I realize that our trip had added a new dimension to my understanding of the fact that brains give rise to our ability to form relationships and make life meaningful. Sometimes, they break."" pg 34It was really difficult for me, personally, to read the parts of this memoir that dealt with Paul learning how to make life and death decisions for ailing patients. He talks in depth about taking people off of life support because they didn't want their bodies to be kept alive while their brains were gone. I was reminded of how my grandfather, though he never suffered any debilitating brain injury, was kept alive through endless medicines and machines to reduce the water around his heart. He eventually refused to eat and refused a feeding tube, so he slowly withered away.. this from a man who lived for eating and described the joys of consuming a fresh peach in summer as one of his favorite memories. It was heartbreaking. In this passage, one of Paul's professors is talking about the same type of situation with his own grandma: ""But ""what was most evident,"" he continued, ""was the slow drawing away from life... By the time Bubbeh stopped praying, she had stopped virtually everything else as well."" pg 41 ebook. Eating was my grandpa's form of prayer. So, you may want to avoid this memoir if you have any fresh grief that you're dealing with, as this book brings it all bubbling to the surface.Paul studies so hard to become a doctor to learn the secrets of life and death. But, he begins to realize, that as a doctor, he'll constantly deal with these moments but never truly understand them: ""I began to suspect that being so close to the fiery light of such moments only blinded me to their nature, like trying to learn astronomy by staring directly at the sun. I was not yet with patients in their pivotal moments, I was merely at those pivotal moments."" pg 56Then, he has his own illness and realizes that, even though he's seen death and suffering, he really knew nothing about it: ""It occurred to me that my relationship with statistics changed as soon as I became one."" pg 82. The rest of the book is so very sad, but one thing is clear, Paul Kalanithi finally found the moment when breath becomes air, what he had been searching for his whole life. Neurosurgeons write really fine memoirs. At least, that's been the case for nearly every one I've come across. Some read alikes, if you're interested: A Thousand Naked Strangers: A Paramedic’s Wild Ride to the Edge and Back by Kevin Hazzard (not a neurosurgeon, but Kevin talks about the burnout that comes in the medical community), Medicine, Miracles, and Manifestations: A Doctor's Journey Through the Worlds of Divine Intervention, Near-death Experiences, and Universal Energy by John L. Turner (neurosurgeon), Into the Magic Shop: A Neurosurgeon's Quest to Discover the Mysteries of the Brain and the Secrets of the Heart by James R. Doty (neurosurgeon), or Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife by Eben Alexander."

Not in a happy and cool way but in a way that shook me and chilled me first and then slowly and then at once, left me broken. I loved it because it had its effect on me.I already knew about Paul and that he didn’t get to finish this book as he wanted to, so I was ready for the emotional effect this book might have on me. The foreword was very good and the prologue made me sad, but then Paul didn’t jump straight to his illness. Words have a longevity I do not. So there were basically two main parts to the book. The first about him choosing neurosurgery and dealing with patients and his understanding about life and death. The second about leaving all he knows to become a patient and to know the gaps between the two lives he couldn’t fill before, about facing death and dealing with his time.Shouldn’t terminal illness, then, be the perfect gift to that young man who had wanted to understand death? What better way to understand it than to live it? But I’d had no idea how hard it would be, how much terrain I would have to explore, map, settle. I’d always imagined the doctor’s work as something like connecting two pieces of railroad track, allowing a smooth journey for the patient. I hadn’t expected the prospect of facing my own mortality to be so disorienting, so dislocating. I thought back to my younger self, who might’ve wanted to “forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race”; looking into my own soul, I found the tools too brittle, the fire too weak, to forge even my own conscience.I have had a little experience of myself with the things he discussed in part one. I was horrified and I was grateful. It had my heart constantly thumping and my eyes didn’t seem to leave the words even to blink. I was completely lost there. Then came the second part which went a little slow but then it just had me crying ugly till I finished it and the epilogue. I can’t rate anyone’s life but this book is really something.I pray that Lucy and Cady are well and happy.Highly Recommended.
My Thoughts as I Read:
I was such a mess. Didn’t write a word as I read. I hope I’ll live long enough that she has some memory of me. I had thought I could leave her a series of letters—but what would they say? I don’t know what this girl will be like when she is fifteen; I don’t even know if she’ll take to the nickname we’ve given her. There is perhaps only one thing to say to this infant, who is all future, overlapping briefly with me, whose life, barring the improbable, is all but past.That message is simple:When you come to one of the many moments in life where you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.Swati's Review"

This book seems to be immensely popular on here, with lots of glowing reviews to choose from. But on the other hand though, there are reviews from individuals that didn't enjoy this as much as they had expected, and on this occasion, I belong with that minority. Before I talk about When Breath Becomes Air, I am going to give a little background information. I have been touched closely by cancer twice. Once as a teenager, when my Mother battled a rather aggressive form of breast cancer, and less than a year ago, when I lost my dear uncle, who lost his cancer battle within three months of a diagnosis, so I can certainly understand cancer and the devastating effects it has on people's lives.I really do empathise with Dr Kalanithi, beginning with what he endured at the hands of cancer, and for his dear family, living on without him, but despite all of that, I just didn't like this book. Dr Kalanithi was obviously a highly skilled neuro surgeon, that saved and improved countless lives, and I respect that. But throughout the book, except for the epilogue, I couldn't shake the feeling of the tone being rather pretentious, with a distinct lack of emotion, and in some particular sections, he was detailing his accomplishments in such a way to the reader to prove something, like he was worthy of being remembered after his death, solely due to these accomplishments. The memoir itself didn't feel like typical memoir material that I look for. His writing felt too flowery, with not enough passion or involvement. It felt like Dr Kalanithi was writing from a distance, with a lack of connection, and honestly, it felt like he was writing a paper for a degree. There is an aspect of the memoir that I found to be disturbing, and that was the fact Dr Kalanithi was still working/ operating on patients while receiving treatment like chemotherapy and various other drugs. While I realise and know first hand that some individuals do carry on working with a terminal illness, I doubt the choice that Dr Kalanithi made was safe for himself, or the patients that he was operating on. It only takes a split second mistake to change someone's life. I mean, if the family knew their surgeon was so ill and currently receiving treatment for cancer would they have gone ahead and signed the paperwork for him to operate?Not all was lost though, as I really enjoyed reading the epilogue, which was written by Dr Kalanithi's wife, Lucy. This was all that I had hoped the memoir would have been. It was emotional, moving, heartfelt and honest. I think I learned a lot about Dr Kalanithi, just within those few pages. I wish I loved this more than I do, but that said, I'm glad I picked it up, as it had been on my radar for a while. I know that people have read this in a completely different light, but for me, it fell short of being a beautiful memoir."
65,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a moving book written by a young doctor who was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. The memoir covers Paul's experiences as a medical student, why he chose to study medicine, and how quickly he had to adapt to being diagnosed with a deadly disease.Part of this book's meaning comes from the sense that it is unfinished, because Paul's life was cut short by cancer. There is a desperation to his writing, the urge to get thoughts down on paper NOW rather than later, knowing he didn't have much time left. There is poignancy in what he's written, and in the things he didn't have a chance to write. The book concludes with an emotional epilogue written by his wife, which wraps up the book well.I would recommend When Breath Becomes Air to those interested in cancer or medical stories, or those who appreciate an impassioned memoir.Favorite Quotes""My mother, afraid the impoverished school system would hobble her children, acquired, from somewhere, a 'college prep reading list.' Trained in India to be a physiologist, married at twenty-three, and preoccupied with raising three kids in a country that was not her own, she had not read many of the books on the list herself. But she would make sure her kids were not deprived. She made me read 1984 when I was ten years old; I was scandalized by the sex, but it also instilled in me a deep love of, and care for, language.""[on Paul's experience as a student]""Life felt rich and full, and over the next two years I kept at it, seeking a deeper understanding of a life of the mind. I studied literature and philosophy to understand what makes life meaningful, studied neuroscience and worked in an fMRI lab to understand how the brain could give rise to an organism capable of finding meaning in the world, and enriched my relationships with a circle of dear friends through various escapades.""""Time for me now is double-edged: every day brings me further from the low of my last relapse but closer to the next recurrence — and, eventually, death. Perhaps later than I think, but certainly sooner than I desire. There are, I imagine, two responses to that realization. The most obvious might be an impulse to frantic activity; to 'life life to its fullest,' to travel, to dine, to achieve a host of neglected ambitions. Part of the cruelty of cancer, though, is not only that it limits your time; it also limits your energy, vastly reducing the amount you can squeeze into a day. It is a tired hare who now races. And even if I had the energy, I prefer a more tortoiselike approach. I plod, I ponder, Some days, I simply persist."" [from the epilogue, written by Paul's wife]""Two days after Paul died, I wrote a journal entry addressed to [our daughter] Cady: 'When someone dies, people tend to say great things about him. Please know that all the wonderful things people are saying now about your dad are true. He really was that good and that brave.'"""

Though I'd never presume as much, I try to maintain my faith that a reason exists for the premature death of someone like Paul Kalanithi, who was ably devoted to giving so much. That is to say, I must have hope that Dr. Kalanithi, a mid-30s highly respected neurosurgeon with a loving wife and infant daughter, was empowered by his disease, as the best of empyreal messengers, to contemplate, conceive and write his message with a profundity that reminds readers that we are mortal, a reminder not in a melancholic or morbid sense, but as eyeing a morning glory, as we move forward on the road to the rest of our lives. Put another way, I need to believe in my soul that angels are among us.As I see it, his message is that we each will die, but we can live a meaningful life by giving of ourselves to make an impact on others, by trying to improve those around us by doing good deeds and by art, such as by creative writing. In this way, we may live on, as Dr. Kalanithi has managed through this sublime memoir.I found touching his wife's epilogue describing his monumental endeavor to write this memoir and I especially admired her strength to endure what must have been an extremely painful ordeal in writing of his last couple of weeks, when he could write no more."

It could have been written in faux-philosophical, metaphorical, teenage-emo poetry, and it comes close. Fortunately it ends up being touching and wise and inspiring without being nauseating. Paul Kalanithi is the kind of guy you can't help but resent because he's such a good person. He's brilliant, altruistic, but not so perfect it's too good to be true. And apparently he's a naturally talented writer. I don't mean to be insensitive, and of course I don't envy what he and his family went through, but wow. I wish I could be so inspiring!This addresses mortality, faith, family, medicine. It's heartbreaking but ultimately not depressing. It's not my favorite book ever, but it's a good reminder to live a life worth living and it's deserving of its Pulitzer nomination.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"
68,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish,Rating 5 out of 5,"What makes human life meaningful? Kalanithi, a thirty-six year old neurosurgeon, tried to locate the nexus of language between science and philosophy to answer the question. “Literature provide[s] the best account of a life of the mind, illuminates another’s experience, and provides the richest material for moral reflection.” There is messiness and weight in real human life that is not accounted for by science, says Kalanithi. Science and analytics (and atheism) cannot encompass all the mystery of human life. He gives the best argument I have heard for religious faith, suggesting that no one human has any answers because each individual has only piece of the puzzle. It is only in human connection that we can start to put the pieces together, making sense of the world. “Human knowledge grows in the relationships we form between each other and the world.”Science, created by human hands to make sense of the world, cannot contain the world. It doesn’t account for those things that make literature, and life, so compelling and so meaningful: “hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue…sacrifice, redemption, forgiveness…justice...goodness…mercy.” Questions without answers. Pieces of a puzzle.Kalanithi died of lung cancer shortly after writing these words. But he strove every day, in his work, in his studies, in his family and friends, to find meaning in life. He thought it might reside in words. Language. As a neurosurgeon he was taught, and he believed, that if a person lost the capacity to communicate--to speak or to understand language—their life became no life at all. He was a student of literature besides being a neurosurgeon, and in language was meaning. This memoir is Kalanithi’s attempt at connection. The Foreword is written by a Dr. Abraham Verghese, author of the unique and unforgettable novel about medicine and Africa, Cutting for Stone. The Epilogue is written by his wife, Lucy Kalanithi, also a doctor. Their words fore and aft add heft and a kind of imprimatur: this man really existed and, yes, he was as thoughtful as he appears. His life had meaning.Kalanithi changed my mind about something, and showed up a deficit, a smallness in my own thinking. I have always been suspicious of people who spend their lives in school, even though they might be concurrently working, piling up more and more degrees. Anybody can do that, I thought. Kalanithi completed a Bachelor's in English literature and human biology, a Master's in English literature, a degree from Cambridge in the history and philosophy of science and medicine, a medical degree with neuroscience and neurosurgery specializations. He was in his mid-thirties when he finally finished. And then he died. That last year he wrote this book and he managed to show me that, if one is focused and serious and seeks the critical nexus between life and death, one may begin to perceive the outlines of a moral philosophy that might help answer the large questions. We only have a lifetime to find meaning, and sometimes that lifetime is short.When Kalanithi talks of his 8-month old daughter shortly before his death, how she is all future and he is all past, we see what he sees: that their circles just touch, but don’t significantly overlap. She will never know him. This has the poignancy, truth, messiness, love, and tragedy of literature. Of life.I listened to the audio of this book, read by Sunil Malhotra and Cassandra Campbell. I have encountered Malhotra before and he is one of the best narrators in my experience. His pacing is perfect and he makes the reading very easy to follow. I ended up buying the hardcover because the book was so meaningful for me and because it is easy to pass around.“One key to managing a terminal illness is to be deeply in love, vulnerable, kind, generous, grateful.” –Lucy Kalanithi"

Paul has a very promising career – at first he does a Masters in English and then moves on to neurosurgery. He explains this well – he has a deep rooted interest in seeking true meaning and suggests that it has to be at the intersection of philosophy and the sciences. He later forms the opinion that despite the hard nature of the work, neurosurgery places him nearest to his quest.Paul is diagnosed with lung cancer in his thirties, after he shows symptoms of weight loss and body pain. His life changes totally after that, and he now sees life as a patient. The metamorphosis from a doctor to a terminally ill patient is a very revealing experience for Paul. There are also many unknowns and decisions to be made – can he get back to neurosurgery ever, how much time does he have and how should he spend it, how he should be secure his wife Lucy’s future. After considerable debate, he and his wife decide to start a family.The treatment shows promise initially and the cancer does not progress. Paul gets back to neurosurgery, and gradually almost maintains his earlier busy schedules with sheer willpower. After a few weeks, though, his health suffers setbacks with more tumors and the line of treatment proving difficult. The birth of their daughter is a joyous moment which Paul cherishes. The writing is extremely good – almost poetic, and if only time had allowed Paul to write more. The afterword by his wife Lucy is very touching as well. As she says – Paul maintained his composure and dignity at all times and faced death bravely. He was never broken, and his life offers lessons for others. This is also a story of a strong family with Paul’s parents, brothers, his wife Lucy and daughter where death visited the person they loved dearly, much too soon. For his daughter Elizabeth Acadia, it is a poignant record of the remarkable person her dad was – deeply intellectual and very human."
71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma,Rating 5 out of 5,"I put down this book with tears in my eyes. It ends with an epilogue written by Lucy Kalanithi, Paul's wife; her description of his last days and the enduring love she continues to feel for him are heartbreaking. Yet her words provide a fitting close to a book which, as she remarks, is largely about Paul as an individual, and illuminates the emotional impact of his illness on him and his family, something that his very matter of fact tone doesn't always reveal.While reading, I was reminded of the argument Atul Gawande makes in Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, that the levels and extent of medical intervention in the treatment of life changing or terminal illness needs to be directed by the choices of the individual, determined by what they consider to be the most important aspects of their life and how they want to spend the time they have left. With the help and support Lucy and his consultant, Emma, Paul seems to have been able to do this throughout most of his illness. Firstly, in his aim of returning to practice neurosurgery, then in the writing of this book, and finally the decision not to be intubated, instead choosing to spend time with his daughter and the rest of his family. It is this focus on individual choice that made the book feel empowering as well as moving. Paul was a man with an enquiring mind and a determined spirit, one who was resolved to maintaining the agency in his life. Because decisions about his care were based on his priorities, he was able to achieve the goals he set himself, including being able to set down the words within this book to speak for his experience and perhaps offer comfort, knowledge....something to those who read them. He stands as an example about how to live life and how to cope with death.Many thanks to Random House UK/Vintage Publishing and Netgalley for the opportunity to read this copy in exchange for an honest review."

After the diagnosis, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. But now I knew it acutely. The problem wasn’t really a scientific one. The fact of death is unsettling. Yet there is no other way to live.There are not many Yale-educated neurosurgeons, and perhaps only this one who first obtained a BA and Masters in English Literature from Stanford. So, when Dr. Kalanithi was diagnosed with lung cancer in his early 30’s, he may have been uniquely capable of writing this book.A quote from the When Breath Becomes Air’s epilogue, written by the author’s widow, sums up the book quite well:Paul’s decision not to avert his eyes from death epitomizes a fortitude we don’t celebrate enough in our death-avoidant culture. His strength was defined by ambition and effort, but also by softness, the opposite of bitterness. He spent much of his life wrestling with the question of how to live a meaningful life, and his book explores that essential territory.When Breath Becomes Air is a moving memoir, and a thoughtful meditation on what makes life meaningful enough to go on living. Highly recommended."

Ever since, I have recommended it to a handful of my friends in medicine and they all have given it 5 stars.I have bought two paper copies of this book, one for me and one for a close friend too and currently I have listened to it as an audiobook. Since the last time I read this one, I advanced in medicine through the clinical years, license exam, internship and now as a resident which made this even more impactful. This is the kind of books that I find myself visiting over time again and again and I believe it will always be 5 stars. The way Kalanithi weaved his life is just on different level. This re-read made me appreciate neurosurgery and medicine even more. It is bittersweet that he made me root for him and just wait for him to tell us he survived at the end of the book despite me knowing real life doesn't work like that. In short, a personal favorite book that is close to my heart and this won't be my last re-read!"

I read this book because I found the topic mixed with the personal investment fascinating, but I also read it knowing it was going to be really sad and make me reflect on mortality and how we live our lives. This book provided me with everything I expected and also something new: a description in depth of the man behind Paul. How he grew up, what he believed it, how he viewed his career. This part of the book was my favourite because I think it was necessary. We really get to know Paul before we get to read his devastating account of what it’s like to live with terminal cancer; an account that his wife had to finish because Paul passed away before he could do so himself.

Despite a bit of distancing, I as a reader got a really good idea of what it felt like to be diagnosed and to live with terminal cancer, both physically and psychologically, and also got a good sense of the experience of being trained to be a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist.It’s the kind of book that could easily be read in one or two sittings. I did not want to put it down. The loss of this man was a tragic one. Huge loss. For his family, for medicine, definitely personally. He was a wonderful man and I appreciated his honesty on these pages. I liked how he conveyed his decision making process and how he talked about quality of life issues. Even the seemingly ever present HOPE doctors insist upon he did in a mostly realistic manner. He was courageous and I admire how he tried to live the best rest of his life. His account was heartbreaking to read.Personally I could have done without some of the religious references but that is them and so I was fine with that. I did have personal and very strong negative feelings about this couple deciding to have a child together when they knew he would not survive that child’s childhood, but for this family I guess it worked. I really loved all the literary references!I so wanted to add my female authors shelf! His wife should have gotten credit for the very well written and important epilogue. Yes, I know this was Paul’s book and that he wrote it only after he was diagnosed and wrote it for his daughter, but it was unfinished when he died. And his wife Lucy’s portion was a great and for me needed addition to what Paul left. I appreciated how she described some things about him that didn’t come through as strongly in his portions, such as his wonderful sense of humor and his deep caring for friends & family. She did a great job and I’d love to read a full book by her. The epilogue was an important part of this book. But she is not credited/does not take credit as a coauthor, so I assigned only my male authors shelf. Between the two of them I got a good sense of them and their family members, friends, and colleagues. (I’m happy that Lucy has a good present: https://www.washingtonpost.com/entert... and I also have to read The Bright Hour: A Memoir of Living and Dying by Nina Riggs.)"

77,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4636758-vanessa,Rating 5 out of 5,"I couldn't not rate this book 5 stars. I don't know if it was because it was non-fiction, and truly touching because of that, or because it was just so compulsively readable and fascinating, or maybe some other reason. All I know is this is one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read. And yes, I cried.Science has never really been a strong interest of mine, but this book has opened the floodgates in terms of pursuing scientific-based non-fiction in the future. Paul Kalanithi was a neurosurgeon and budding neuroscientist, and the vast knowledge that he imparted in this book was both fascinating and incredibly understandable for a novice like myself. I also loved how he managed to integrate the world of the arts with the world of science, two things that are usually seen as polar opposites. His musings on life and what it means to be were touching and I loved how he melded his scientific knowledge with ideas he had taken from the literary works he had read over the years.Kalanithi came across as a wonderful, caring, intelligent man who just wanted to help people through absolutely no selfish means. His writing flowed beautifully and I truly felt like I was close to him while reading and a real part of his story. However, it wasn't until the epilogue (written by his wife/widow Lucy Kalanithi) that I truly felt the sadness of his illness and what it really meant to be on the outside of it. Lucy's words on Paul's last days battling his terminal lung cancer were heartbreaking and I couldn't not cry. She wrote about him so beautifully though, and I thought it was a perfect ending to the sadly unfinished book.I would highly recommend everyone read this - it is a truly touching, well-written memoir, and something that I think everyone could enjoy and take something from, despite its sad subject matter."

When Breath Becomes Air is a very moving and unforgettable memoir. Once I had finished this book I needed to just sit awhile to gather my thoughts and wipe my tears away. Highly recommended. "

80,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1834059-april,Rating 3 out of 5,"I received this book from Goodreads First Reads.Overall I enjoyed this book, however I did enjoy the afterword written by Paul's wife, Lucy, better than the rest of the book. Here's why:1. I'm not a huge fan of classic literature...Whitman, Dickens, Twain, Austen, etc. There were a lot of references to authors and titles that I have never heard of. I don't really care for the language used in the classics and I often felt like the flow of this book took that tone.2. I'm also not a fan of books using big words, when I have to look up too many words to understand what the author is trying to say I lose interest or just skim through those parts of the book. It's the authors love of language and style of writing that I just don't appreciate. 3. There were a lot of technical terms and procedures that he was explaining in the book that related to the field of medicine. This coupled with the large words he used made me lose interest.4. Lucy was able to describe very complex emotions and Paul's final days with a touch of simplicity that was interesting and engaging to me. It didn't feel complicated to me when reading the afterword - it felt more emotional. There is one line in the book that I did mark that I feel sums this book up beautifully: ""...even if I'm dying, until I actually die, I am still living."" It's how Paul lived his life before he was even diagnosed with Cancer, which made him a fantastic doctor and on through his last days. Now that I've probably made myself look very uneducated....those who have a love of classic literature and a large vocabulary will most likely enjoy this book. Despite the things I didn't like about the book I feel this one is worth a read. The content and character of this book has a lot to offer. "

But above all see what it is to still live, to profoundly influence the lives of others after you are gone by your words.” From the forward by Abraham Verghese.Paul Kalanithi was a very brave man with the talent and promise of becoming a brilliant neurosurgeon when he was diagnosed with cancer in his last year of residency. He also loved literature which is so evident in his beautiful and stunning writing. “Frail but never weak” he entered into his earthly life’s final transformation on his own terms, the reflections of which would make for rich and insightful conversation in a group setting. How often have we heard the question If you only had 6 months to live what would you do with the precious time left, especially when each day can redefine your value system. I would have loved to explore his thoughts and choices with fellow readers.One of my favorite sections of this narrative is the epilogue by Paul’s wife Lucy. It stands on its own as a poignant witness and testimony to a man greatly respected and well loved. As she stated ""My marriage didn't end when I became a widow.” and in describing his memoir she wrote:“He spent much of his life wrestling with the question of how to live a meaningful life and his book explores that essential territory.” I listened to the very excellent audio version and highly recommend it.

What happens when the doctor becomes the patient?Unfortunately, this one was simply not for me. I sympathised with Kalanithi, but at no point did I feel any real connection with him, which I think is crucial in order to fully appreciate this kind of memoir. I found his writing style to be quite dry and clinical, and I would zone out at times while listening. My favourite part of the book was actually the epilogue that his wife had written following his death. Her writing was beautiful and almost moved me to tears.As always the ratings that I give for memoirs are solely based on enjoyment factor. Who am I to judge anyone's personal thoughts, reflections and life? Although I didn't enjoy this, I wouldn't dissuade others from reading it given how many people simply loved it.

What a beautiful, inspirational and thought-provoking memoir. The quote above is central to When Breath Becomes Air, first as he helps his patients to address this issue, and then as he has to do so himself. I found the first chapters very interesting as it deals with neuroscience and -surgery, and his thoughts on the doctor-patient relationship. But I loved the second half of the book where he takes us on his journey once he is diagnosed with lung cancer. Obviously it is sad, but he shows us that ""Death may be a one-time event, but living with a terminal illness is a process."" Paul goes through this process with integrity and empathy. I also admire his wife for her strength and her epilogue really touched my heart. Highly recommended. "

I cannot help but feel weird about rating such a thing, especially because this is the account of a person’s life. so I won’t be rating this, nor others in the future, but know that I believe everyone should read this book at least once in their life.
“What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy.”
how does one talk about When Breath Becomes Air? perhaps I can start by saying that prior to reading this book, I knew next to nothing about it, except for that it was well-received and well-loved. I knew nothing about paul kalanithi or who he was and what he did. however, just as how abraham verghese describes in his foreword, one cannot read this book without feeling like they know kalanithi afterward. and so, not only did I find myself engrossed in his words and story, but also his work and practice. I deeply appreciated the insight that kalanithi’s autobiography provides in his area of study and work, but more so appreciate how kalanithi viewed his work in a moral sphere. I think it—how one’s life work entangles itself with the human experience and the ultimate end of death—is often something pondered by those of us who seek to understand the mortality we inevitably face. and kalanithi, who directly addressed, experienced, and grappled with this as a neurosurgeon with cancer, probably came to the most graspable conclusion that I have ever read.kalanithi’s autobiography is ordered in the most sensible but distressing of ways. readers learn in the beginning that kalanithi develops cancer and meets death because of it, but this prologue is followed by almost 100 pages of his fledgling beginning. we see his growth from a young boy to a college grad to a practicing neurosurgeon. we see his success and his hardships and we cannot help but be thrilled for the success that we know he will and could have achieved. and then we get to chapter two. where the narrative shifts back to what we knew—but set back in our minds—would inevitably happen. and it is here when the perspective changes. no longer are we reading from the mind of an accomplished and successful neurosurgeon who is an actor in his field, but from the distressed and lost cancer patient who is now the one acted on, the roles irrevocably reversed on him. this literary shift—aside from the masterful writing itself—is what makes kalanithi’s autobiography so poignant. the second half of his book tackles the confusion and despair that came with his diagnosis, but most riveting to me was the grief and mourning that came to be. kalanithi describes how, from the very beginning, he began mourning his loss of self, future, and life, and how he grieved for the past version of himself (and his family) whose plans were ruined by his cancer diagnosis. this had to be the most heartbreaking thing of all, for how does one even begin to conceptualize such a feeling?and in the end, when the inevitable came to pass and what I knew was coming arrived, I still found myself bent towards my knees—stains on my cheeks—because kalanithi wrote not only about the sorrow of a loss like this but of the beauty of life itself. the beauty of our existence, of our joy. and this was the greatest gift of all. his book imparts upon readers the importance of living life as fully as possible, for we do not know the timeline of our existence. we do not know our fates; and as kalanithi notes, the question is not “why me” but “why not me.” so hold on to the things that bring you joy, find what makes your heart and soul full, take the risks that scare you, and above all else, walk the path of life with gratitude, because every moment is a gift.
“You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.”

“Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.”

“I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”

“Science may provide the most useful way to organize empirical, reproducible data, but its power to do so is predicated on its inability to grasp the most central aspects of human life: hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue.”

“Years ago, it had occurred to me that Darwin and Nietzsche agreed on one thing: the defining characteristic of the organism is striving.”

“That message is simple: When you come to one of the many moments in life when you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more, but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.”

His life was dedicated to saving the lives of others and his work, in the area of neurosurgery, was renowned. But what happens to the mind of a man so used to being the savior, when he unexpectedly discovers he is to become the patient?From the synopsis, and numerous 5-star reviews I have read about this book, I knew this was going to break my heart. I did not expect it to have such a profound and lasting effect on me, however. Paul’s story is a sad and, unfortunately, not a rare one. The things he suffers have been suffered before. His story has been recounted and written of before. But never have I read such a sensitive and evocative account of such a thing; of a life taken far too soon.Paul truly came to life in these pages. I lived his joys and his successes; his heartbreak and his fears. I became a part of his family. I was invited to share details of his work life and his home love. I grew with Paul. And the story’s apex hurt me all the more because of it. I felt I got to intimately know a brilliant individual and the story’s unavoidable apex hit me like the loss of a loved one, rather than that of an actual stranger.Paul’s story is one worthy to be told and shared, but it is the way it is delivered that really makes it stand-out. Because Paul, as well as being an illustrious surgeon and a proficient writer, was also a wonderful human being with so much to teach us all. He gracefully deals with and recounts traumatic subject matters and triggering topics, and skillfully weaves the narrative of his own life into instructions on how to make our own a better one.This is blurbed as being a must-read for trainee doctors. But I would say it is a must-read for any human, who wishes to face all this world has to throw at us and still keep our humanity intact. It is not our closeness to tragedy that will ruin us, it is our growing ease with it that will, in an ever-increasingly violent world.Paul invites us to share his story and his pain, and to remember that pain every time we allow ourselves to let our humanity slip. Every hurt has a human face. No story is void of characters. Paul will live on through the sharing of his story, but also in making his readers live a life filled with compassion in kindness, no matter the adversity to be faced."

When your perspective is broadened, your thinking changes, and your own way of living opens up for self-examination. All of this impacts how you move forward with your life...thus the change.Paul Kalanithi's memoir offers perspective about living in regards to the detached medical science of function, the philosophy and theology of being present, and the desperate need we all have to process and feel human emotion. I am urged to view my physicians as emotional human beings and not the white coats with all (or none) of the answers. I am urged to show love and appreciation daily to my family. I am urged to confront my discomfort and make every effort to spend time and unfiltered conversation with the terminally ill. What true perspective we miss out on when we withdraw from the dying, but the true tragedy is how avoidance negatively impacts quality of life and authentic human connections. I loved this book.My favorite quote:“Relying on his own strength and the support of his family and community, Paul faced each stage of his illness with grace—not with bravado or a misguided faith that he would “overcome” or “beat” cancer but with an authenticity that allowed him to grieve the loss of the future he had planned and forge a new one. He cried on the day he was diagnosed. He cried while looking at a drawing we kept on the bathroom mirror that said, “I want to spend all the rest of my days here with you.” He cried on his last day in the operating room. He let himself be open and vulnerable, let himself be comforted. Even while terminally ill, Paul was fully alive; despite physical collapse, he remained vigorous, open, full of hope not for an unlikely cure but for days that were full of purpose and meaning.”"

I had spine surgery at Stanford Hospital that resulted in complications that I am still living with. Consequently, three disturbing things about this book stood out to me:1) when his group of doctors are asked to put patients first and sign an oath to that effect, they all refused to sign. 2) he was still doing delicate neurosurgery while he was in intense pain and drugged up with chemo, because he was ""trying to keep going."" What about the patient? He admits a critical error was made in the last surgery he did. Something that clearly is going to heavily impact the patient for the rest of his or her life. I think the author was being very selfish at this point. 3) For those who follow sports, the botched spinal surgery the author participated in his final procedure was the exact error---a nick in the sheath of the spinal cord (the dura)---that another surgeon made on Golden State Warriors coach. Steve Kerr in 2015. Kerr has continued to suffer horrible symptoms from it: powerful migraines, neck pain, and nausea. The author of this book is dead. I wonder how much the patient of the last surgery is still suffering to this day?=========Here's a simple question for everyone to ask themselves.

“You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.” 
As both a medical professional and someone with chronic illness (requiring hospitalizations in the past) I am still stunned how Kalanthi grappled with these two halves of being.

It'd take me a lifetime to learn from it.We all know that we'd one day die, but we're always surprised when that day comes. Paul, as his wife wrote in the epilogue, not only described the terrain but also traversed it bravely. In the process, he taught us to find the meaning of our own lives, to be the best possible versions of ourselves, and to face our own demise. Death is not an enemy that we need to fight. It's a fact that we need to accept and reconcile with our living. I will treasure the book for as long as I live. When my day comes, I will again look it up for encouragement. "

I do think they pair nicely together. Both are written by surgeons! Atul Gawande has had a long career in which he has had to learn about working with patients, and has some informed views on death and dying. Paul Kalanithi was still completing his residency in neurosurgery when he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, and is able to speak from dual perspectives of surgeon and patient. I enjoyed reading Kalanithi because he is just so intelligent. He has received degrees in English and biology/medicine, even both at the graduate level, because he was trying to find the best way to explore the idea of what makes us think, how do the mind and brain connect, and what does that mean for our humanity? He is deep and his education has been an intense one. At times it felt a bit name-dropping but I suppose his humanity is also being a surgeon (traditionally a healthy slice of ego there) - I imagine if he had lived to see the finishing of this book and worked with an editor, they may have talked him out of a few mentions of schools or feeling the need to explain something along the line of ""nobody else was smart enough to do this but I was."" Overall this isn't even a complaint, this is his personality, and it is coupled with a serious desire to understand and contribute. Here are a few examples that resonated with me:""There is a moment - a cusp - when the sum of gathered experience is worn down by the details of living. We are never so wise as when we live in this moment.""""After so many years of living with death, I'd come to understand that the easiest death was not necessarily the best.... We decided to have a child. We would carry on living, instead of dying.""""I needed words to go forward. And so it was literature that brought me back to life....""""Even if I'm dying, until I actually die, I am still living."" The end includes an epilogue by his wife, and while I can appreciate her desire to restate why he was a significant person, I found it unnecessary. The work, the thinking, stands for itself. And even with a parent with very serious illness (nobody is using the word terminal except sarcoma always is), I found this book uplifting in the sense that there is an understanding about the inevitability of death here. For some reason that is soothing to me."

The author led an interesting life, cut so short by an illness he had treated many times. His background in literature and science and medicine was so interesting to me; it seems you do not have to choose either/either. He was tremendously skilled at both. He'd backflipped at various times in his life between medicine and writing, and considering being diagnosed with terminal cancer in his 3rd decade of life and having become successful at both, this is extraordinary.Paul Kalanthini was a neurosurgeon in his peak, having trained for what he mentioned almost half of his years in his field. Happily married with so much on the horizon, his life turned so quickly. What was evident was his supportive family who loved him dearly.Turning from doctor to patient, the author was easily able to tell his story with candour and expertise, with insights I would never have imagined. His doctor had to put it to him, shall she work with him as 'doctor only' or does he want to be more involved. He had expectations of his care that would not be the case had he been a layperson.The author was so proud of his daughter, the decision was made to become parents after diagnosis. The final part of his writing addressed this special bond and his complete and utter desire for her to know of his fatherly love. Paul's wife is also a doctor, and provided the epilogue that talked of their final months together, this was written with love, respect and compassion. This was a family that went through much, was able to access good care and likewise were able to tell their story.I listened to this on BorrowBox at 1.5 speed via my public library."
99,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"A short and powerful memoir about living in the face of death.At 36 years old, neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. When Breath Becomes Air was written in his final months. In this thoughtful and deeply personal memoir, Dr. Kalanithi explains the questions of life-and-death that drove him to become a neurosurgeon. Over the course of the book, he ponders the role of the doctor and what makes life meaningful enough to go on living.
The physician’s duty is not to stave off death or return patients to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face, and make sense of, their own existence.
This is a one-sitting book. Not only is it short in pages, but it's also small in size and spacious in formatting. Dr. Kalanithi's love of language and literature is evident in his writing. The writing is poetic and he frequently references relevant passages from great books. When Breath Becomes Air is divided into two parts: Part 1: In Perfect Health I Begin and Part 2: Cease Not till Death. In Part 1, before his diagnosis, he reflects on his childhood, education, and career. He shares some of the pivotal moments in his life and we witness how seriously he takes his duty to his patients. In Part 2, after his diagnosis, he copes with becoming the patient after years of being the doctor. Always fascinated with the line between life and death, his philosophical questions suddenly become devastatingly relevant. At the end, there is an epilogue written by his wife Lucy. While most of the book is philosophical in nature, Lucy writes about the concrete details and the emotional impact of caring for Paul in his final months and of life after his passing. It is a beautiful testament to her husband.
I began to realize that coming in such close contact with my own mortality had changed both nothing and everything. Before my cancer was diagnosed, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. After the diagnosis, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. But now I knew it acutely. The problem wasn’t really a scientific one. The fact of death is unsettling. Yet there is no other way to live.
While it had the potential to be completely depressing, it is more a celebration of life. There is no wallowing in grief, only the commitment to keep living:""until I actually die, I am still living."" Despite the personal stakes, Dr. Kalanithi writes with surprising objectivity and rationality, almost detachment. It wasn't until Part 2, when his daughter was born, that I became emotional. After that point, it was extremely difficult to continue reading through my tears. Below is the last paragraph before the epilogue (skip if you need to), one of the most touching and heartbreaking things I have ever read:(Directed to his infant daughter) When you come to one of the many moments in life where you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.I admired Dr. Kalanithi's honesty, commitment to life-long learning, and for generously sharing his thought process from his final year. I desperately hoped for a different ending, even though I knew it wasn't possible. Intellectually I know that death happens every second of the day, and to everyone eventually, but it is still difficult to accept that such a thoughtful and vibrant mind could be gone from this earth. I wish he could know how deeply his book has affected so many people! I'm glad he wrote it and to know that it will be there when I need it most (hopefully not for a long time). This novel is relevant to everyone, because we are all living in the face of death. If you enjoyed Gilead by Marilynne Robinson, you will probably enjoy this book. I didn't enjoy Gilead when I read it, but I think I owe it a reread.The earth is quickly turned over by worms, the processes of nature marching on, reminding me of what Paul saw and what I now carry deep in my bones, too: the inextricability of life and death, and the ability to cope, to find meaning despite this, because of this. What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy. (Lucy's Epilogue)"

Có lẽ vì mang mong đợi như vậy từ trước nên khi đọc mình cảm thấy hơi thất vọng. Không hẳn chỉ nói về khoảng thời gian đương đầu với căn bệnh của mình, tác giả còn có mục đích lớn hơn với cuốn sách này, đó là viết một cuốn hồi ký trải dài từ thời niên thiếu qua các cột mốc quan trọng của cuộc đời mình đến lúc khoác lên mình chiếc áo bệnh nhân.Câu chuyện về một người xuất thân từ gia đình có truyền thống y khoa nhưng không đi theo con đường đó mà lại chọn nghiên cứu về triết học, sinh học với mong muốn được giải đáp những thắc mắc của mình về bản chất con người, để rồi sau đó nhận ra chính y khoa mới là nơi chứa đựng câu trả lời cho những thắc mắc ấy, là một câu chuyện thú vị, dễ dàng thu hút người đọc. Nhưng có vẻ do thiên về một nhà nghiên cứu hơn một nhà văn, hay như mình cảm giác tác giả viết quyển sách cho chính mình hơn là cho người khác nên việc đọc sách không dễ chút nào. Nó mang nhiều ý tưởng riêng tư của tác giả về những chủ đề khó đọc như triết học, văn chương cổ điển, và nhất là nặng về tôn giáo khiến cho nhiều đoạn mình không đồng cảm được những suy nghĩ của anh.Tuy vậy từ lúc tác giả rẽ hướng theo con đường trở thành một bác sĩ thì câu chuyện có phần dễ đọc, gần gũi hơn đôi chút, những chia sẻ từ góc độ người trong cuộc khá thú vị, chân thực, vài chi tiết có phần nhạy cảm và có thể gây tranh cãi. Về giọng văn thì càng về sau càng có cảm xúc hơn, tuy nhiên với cái đầu của một bác sĩ quen với việc sinh tử của con người, dù phải đối mặt với chuyện không may xảy đến với mình, tác giả vẫn thể hiện sự điềm tĩnh chứ không quỵ lụy, tuyệt vọng quá mức.Câu chuyện được tác giả dừng lại ở thời điểm anh còn minh mẫn, còn cảm nhận được ý nghĩa cuộc sống và sự quý giá của khoảng thời gian còn lại mà anh được tận hưởng cuộc sống ấy. Một kết thúc lửng lơ nhưng chân thực trong tình cảnh như vậy của tác giả. Đoạn kết được tiếp nối bởi người vợ khá xúc động, nhưng phần nào đó tạo cho mình cảm giác đề cao anh quá mức, hoặc có lẽ do dung lượng sách quá ngắn chưa đủ để thể hiện hết con người anh.Tóm lại thì đây là một cuốn hồi ký với nhiều bài học, trải nghiệm chứa đựng trong đó. Nhưng vì đề cập khá nhiều đến triết học, tôn giáo và cách viết khá khô khan, nghiêm túc làm cho nó có phần khó đọc hơn mình nghĩ. Cộng thêm bản dịch chưa được mượt và biên tập có lẽ do nóng vội để xuất bản nên còn sót nhiều lỗi khiến cho việc hoàn thành cuốn sách mỏng này cũng tốn nhiều công sức (đọc xong lời mở đầu thôi cũng là cả một thử thách -_-). Nhưng nếu vẫn tò mò về câu chuyện đời tác giả bạn cũng có thể tìm đọc, và sau khi đọc xong rồi hẳn cũng sẽ thấy thời gian mình bỏ ra không hề lãng phí"
101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7399266-camie,Rating 5 out of 5,"I spent my career years as a Registered Nurse and always considered that I was someone dedicated and compassionate towards those for whom I cared, but as Paul Kalanithi explains in this wise and lyrical account it is remarkable how quickly and dramatically our perception of terminal illness changes when the patient is us or someone in our own family. Paul is a gifted young neurosurgeon who confronts the life threatening conditions of others daily , and whose own life is tragically cut short. Before he encountered late stage lung cancer his love of literature and medicine filled him with desire to better understand the human condition . His aspirations to write most of this book documenting his personal journey before his death were realized, and as Abraham Verghese states in it's foreword , we have been left a great gift in his message. 5 stars"
102,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"Reading this book was a pain for me. This is because my only son died of a cause unknown rare blood cancer at age 24 in the same Stanford University Hospital in 1998. During his hospitalization in his last days, I did NOT find Stanford University Hospital and the doctors there showing any empathy to me and my family, considering the very difficult situation we were going through. As a matter-of-fact, we were never visited by his attending physician. We were only dealing with inexperienced and novice residents and fellows. On one occasion just before he died, he called me to come to the hospital right away. When I arrived he got up from his bed with all the tubes and what not that were shoved into him, and took me to a corner of the ward and said, ""Dad, these guys are all jerking me around, do something to take me away from here"". So, Dr. Kalanithi's glorification of this noble profession sounds very hollow. His musings on the philosophy of it all may sound touching to others who have not been in my shoe. But NOT to me. "

I'm sad he died, but I'm just not getting why that makes this a great book. The writing is nice and the situation is poignant. I just didn't find that the poignancy translated into great insight. For someone ""racing"" against death to write down an important ""oracular"" message, the author populates too many pages with superficial and somewhat off-putting information about himself, and ultimately fails to synthesize a coherent meaning that reconciles the contradictions encountered regarding the various deeper topics he touches on (love/self-realization, vocation/job, medicine/healing, science/truth, success/happiness, etc.).For a better book by an academician who thinks he's dying, taking stock of his beliefs: How to Be an Antiracist"

As others have noted, for such a short book When Breath Becomes Air seems to have meant an impressive number of things to different readers. While I was moved by many things about this book, including the more personal messages Paul provided for his wife and daughter (as well as his wife's afterword), I particularly appreciated Paul's tireless striving for a meaningful life, and I was intrigued by his exploration of the distinction between the brain and the mind--a distinction I have often pondered myself, albeit without Paul's expertise. I can't think of a person I wouldn't recommend this book to. Paul's intellect, obvious humanity, and willingness to bare his soul add up to a memoir that's even more than the sum of its considerable parts.I won this book via Shelf Awareness. There was no expectation of a review."

موسیقی عجیبی‌ست مرگبلند می‌شویو چنان آرام و نرم می‌رقصیکه دیگر هیچکس تو را نمی‌بیند- گروس عبدالملکیان

پاول یه جراح مغز و اعصاب موفقه. پاول درست در اون نقطه‌ از زندگیش که داره نزدیک به اوج میشه دچار سرطان ریه میشه.‌ و با این کتاب قراره از نگاه یه پزشکِ بیمار، روزهای زندگی قبل و بعد از بیماری‌ش رو ورق بزنیم و منتظر باشیم تا موسیقی عجیب مرگ به صدا دربیاد.
Even if I’m dying, until I actually die, I am still living.
قرار نیست تمام کتاب رو روزهای ��ندگی پاول همراه سرطان ریه تشکیل بده؛ تقریبا در نیمی از کتاب زندگی پاولِ سرسختِ قبل از سرطان رو می‌خونیم؛ اینکه چندین رشته ی تحصیلی رو آغاز کرد، ادبیات و فلسفه رو تجربه کرد تا در آخر به پزشکی و جراحی مغز و اعصاب رسید. اینکه با چنگ و دندون به رشته ی مورد علاقه‌‌ای که بالاخره پیداش کرده بود چسبید و کوتاه نیومد.از روزهای تحصیل پاول می‌خونیم، از سختی‌های پزشکی، و اونقدر خوب از رابطه ی پزشک و بیمار می‌خونیم که حالا تصورم از زندگی یه پزشک متعهد، تصویر کامل و واضحیه چون بارها همراه پاول بین بیمارها قدم‌ میزنیم، بارها وارد اتاق عمل و زندگی شکننده ی یه آدم میشیم. و از نگرانی‌های یه پزشک می خونیم، از دغدغه‌های روزانه‌ش، از سختی‌های طاقت‌فرسای شغلش و از تجربیات ارزشمندی که با صداقت و دلسوزی تمام در اختیار ما قرار میده. تجربیاتی از زندگی، کار، و روبرو شدن با مرگ.بعد از آشنا شدن با شخصیت پاول، برمی‌گردیم به زمان حال و از روند پیشرفت بیماری اون می‌خونیم؛ از وضعیت‌ش، سختی‌هاش، و سرسختی‌ قشنگش.با دست‌نوشته‌های پاول، از روبرو شدنش با مرگ خوندم؛ مرگی که خیلی نزدیکش شده و حالا باید از عکس‌العمل پاول در برابر این فاصله ی کم از مرگ بخونم. که وقتی بدونی به زودی می‌میری، چه چیزی می‌تونه به روزهای باقی‌مونده ی زندگیت ارزش بده؟
I was searching for a vocabulary with which to make sense of death, to find a way to begin defining myself and inching forward again.
قراره همراه پاول سعی کنیم بفهمیم بالاخره چقدر فرصت داریم تا بتونیم برنامه‌ریزی درست رو برای روزهای باقیمونده انجام بدیم... که اگه ده سال فرصت داریم، برگردیم به زندگی عادی و اگه پنج ماه وقت داریم، شروع کنیم به انجام ضروریات. و مشکل اینجاست، که هیچ آمار ثابتی وجود نداره. پاول هیچ‌وقت نمی‌تونه مطمئن باشه چقدر فرصت داره. و تنها چیزی که از داشتنش مطمئنه فقط «یک روزِ» نه بیشتر.اما این حقیقت برای پاول چیزی رو عوض نکرد؛ پاول به قشنگی جنگید. با شجاعت روزهای سخت زندگیش رو سپری کرد. گاهی باورم نمیشد، که اینها همه واقعی‌ان؟ امیدت ساختگی نیست؟ از پس تمام این‌ها براومدی؟و پاول در آخر به زیبایی رقصید؛ چنان آرام و نرم، که دیگه هیچکس اون رو ندید.و این مرد، این پزشک متعهد، طی این صفحات اونقدر برای من عزیز و قابل احترام و ستودنی شد که با وجود اینکه از پایان کتاب خبر داشتم، دارم اشک می‌ریزم برای نفس‌های ارزشمندی که‌ متوقف شدند.
I woke up in pain, facing another day—no project beyond breakfast seemed tenable. I can’t go on, I thought, and immediately, its antiphon responded, completing Samuel Beckett’s seven words, words I had learned long ago as an undergraduate: I’ll go on. I got out of bed and took a step forward, repeating the phrase over and over: “I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”
اما در پایان، این نفس‌های پاول بود که ازش به یادگار موند؛ نفس‌هایی که‌ تک‌تک اونها هوا شده بودند‌‌. نفس‌هایی که تا آخرین توان، زندگی‌ بیماران زیادی رو‌ نجات دادند. که عاشقانه هوا شدند برای نفسِ خیلی‌ها.همیشه فکر می‌کنم زندگی ما و نفس‌های ما چطور ارزشمند میشن؟و حالا از خودم می‌پرسم؛ آیا اینکه نفس هوا بشه کافی نیست؟ پ.ن: به این زندگی، به این سرسختی و به این قلم نمیتونم کمتر از پنج ستاره بدم."
107,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61753513-christy-hammer,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a brilliant book as the author grapples with the knowledge and consequences of a terminal cancer prognosis like most anyone would. How Kalanithi is different is that he pulls together and synthesizes CP Snow's Two Cultures, as his life is equally immersed in the humanities with philosophy and literature, on one hand, as it is in the science and technology fields, on the other. There are no ideologies left behind from his analysis of his and our mortality and struggles to understand our attempts to live a good life. I'd read some of what he'd journaled here before on a blog that was kept documenting struggle with his disease and living a life (as we all do, really, echoing Becker's The Denial of Death), knowing death is possibly imminent. (A nursing student in my SOC course told me I *had* to check it out, and for once I was glad to have taken the advice!) I didn't cry until the lovely and obviously equally brilliant wife's parts at the end, giving a conclusion to her own life's story, in part.Kalanithi's reflections on life and death remind one of Aristotle's claims (a good one to recommend to students to share around a holiday family dinner table) that we're all Gods with anuses, with transcendent minds that have perspective and can cognate on our own mortality yet are mere animals with the mortal bodies that go along with them."

109,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51069187-marie,Rating 5 out of 5,"This brief memoir is interposed between a foreword by Abraham Verghese, the brilliant author of “Cutting for Stone” and an epilogue by author’s wife, Lucy Kalanithi. It is a beautiful, heartrending, deeply philosophical piece by an accomplished young man who dedicated heart and mind to his work and study in neurosurgery. He discovers that he has terminal lung cancer at the age of 36, just before completing his grueling neurosurgical residency and embarking on the career he has worked so hard to attain. The book is very thoughtful and reflective in nature, especially upon the meaning of life. It made me wonder if the author was truly always so interested in finding the meaning of life, or if only when told of this terminal diagnosis, that reflection back on his life made this search so apparent. As one nears death, what is most important, becomes glaringly more obvious, and Paul Kalanithi describes this so well.Abraham Verghese speaks in the foreword of how he had met Paul in person several times before his death, but it was not until he read his book that he felt he really knew him. I too, felt like I got to know Paul through this book. He is very open and honest about himself, his sickness, his relationships, and struggles and triumphs throughout the process of dealing with cancer.I find it interesting that Paul did not always think he wanted to be a physician, but rather thought he might be a writer. He may not have realized his full potential as neurosurgeon and professor, but he surely achieved his goal to be a writer. He has left behind a beautiful book that will be read for many years to come. It will be of great interest to those with life-threatening disease, their family members, and really everyone, because we will all be in those shoes at some point. He has also left behind a wonderful gift of himself to his daughter. She will not remember her time with him, but she will be able to know him through this book and well as through the memories that I’m sure his close relations will share with her. Aside from writing and even delving back into neurosurgery residency at one point, he spent the last years of his life following his diagnosis, building closer bonds with his family, and the love there was overflowing.Aside from being an important read for anyone facing a life-threatening illness themselves or loving someone who is, I think it is a very important read for all medical professionals. It puts a face behind a patient, who is clearly able to articulate the thoughts and feelings of being a patient in our medical system. It emphasizes and highlights the importance of the physician-patient relationship.I give this novel 5 stars, for it’s thought provoking, beautiful prose, as well as for writing it’s way through a death with utmost dignity. He strengthens his belief systems, forges stronger relationships with family and loved ones, and finds greater meaning in life once he is given this terminal diagnosis.For discussion questions, please visit my blog: http://www.book-chatter.com/?p=70 "

“If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining?”
“What is the meaning of life?” This question haunts everyone at least once in their lifetime. From the ones going through dire circumstances to the ones drawing their final breath on the deathbed, each of us question if our life has a purpose and what makes it worth living.“When breath becomes air” is one such a story about a neurosurgeon’s examination of his life when he gets diagnosed with lung cancer. At 36 when Paul is about to finish his residency, he has the exact vision of how his life would look like. But his world turns upside down when he learns he doesn’t have much time left to live.In this memoir, Paul reflects on his early life when he was struggling to find his identity. He talks about the events that led him to choose neurosurgery as his profession and his eventual journey from becoming a doctor to becoming a patient.The writing is beautiful. It is powerful because of its honesty, vulnerability, and hope in the face of tragedy. There are questions and then there are conclusions. There is a deep contemplation about life, identity, purpose, and mortality. It makes you scrutinize your life and the world around you.This book gives us insight into Paul’s life as a doctor and how his perspective about looking at death changes after he confronts his own. I’m amazed by Paul’s indomitable spirit and the way he navigates through his life after learning about his illness.This book is incomplete as Paul could not finish it in time. Nevertheless, he gave his best until the end. Life is short and unpredictable so we should make the most of whatever time we have left. That’s how Paul lived his life and this book will inspire you to do the same."
111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was always going to be an emotional read. Paul Kalanithi was a young man of 36, just a few months shy of completing ten years of training as a neurosurgeon when he was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic lung cancer. He had a great academic career ahead of him as a neuroscientist and neurosurgeon but suddenly that is all taken away from him. In his memoir he reflects back on his life, his search for meaning, his studies in English and philosophy before deciding he wanted to become a doctor. He talks about the long hours of surgery as he refines his skills, and the way he has learnt to talk to patients, gauging what they need to know when they are ready to hear it. He finds his own transition from doctor to patient difficult but reflects on how to lead a meaningful life in the face of impending death. After his diagnosis Paul and his wife Lucy, also a physician made the decision to have a child, even though Paul knew he would not be around to watch her grow up. His final paragraph is heart wrenching as he tells his daughter how much joy she brought him in his brief time with her. Paul Kalanithi died less than two years after his diagnosis without being able to complete his book. His final few weeks and subsequent death are left for his wife Lucy to describe which she does most eloquently. Although this is a sad read, the message is that we should live our lives with meaning and purpose and joy no matter how much time is left to us."

Knowing Paul Kalanithi died when still working on that book makes it even more poignant and heartbreaking. Literally made me left gasping for air when reading his memoir. He was a man of integrity and true inspiration. Faced with terminal illness he remained positive and dignified, living his life to the fullest, trying to not only be the best doctor but also husband and father (despite only having little time with his daughter who was born few months before his passing) he could be. We could all learn from him to make the most of our lives, make them meaningful, to be grateful and compassionate. A book that will stay with me for a long time."

To have written this book after his diagnosis and living in great pain is such a testament to the person he was. He was always trying to give to other people, whether it was through his practice as a neurosurgeon or in writing his story for this book. I believe this novel is as much about living as it is about dying. Living a purposeful life- a life with meaning. Always moving forward even under unthinkable circumstances.

'Cause I literally found ways to escape from Christmas cooking just to be able to read more of this book. And like I said in one of my updates, I had zero intentions of reading this novel this year, however, for whatever reason when I passed by it, I picked it up, and began reading it. Quite honestly, this random decision might have been one of my best decisions this month.I knew going into this that Paul Kalanithi was going to die from his sickness (it's literally on the back of the cover folks) - and I thought I would cry at the end. In fact, I was pretty sure of it. Instead, I got teary eyed, but I didn't cry. Like his wife, Lucy, put it, Paul looked death right in the eye and accepted his fate with unwavering bravery. And because of his bravery and strength, I did not think it was right to cry when I read about his death. I don't think he would have wanted that.Since I am also very interested in books/literature/writing and on the flip-side, medicine/science/health, his novel really resonated with me. After all, Paul felt the same way about medicine and literature as I do, right now. That understanding that I'm not the only one to have two loves that are so different, and yet, so intertwined, really made me fall in love with this novel more. Paul understood and saw the parallels that so many people today fail to realize. Because if I had a quarter for every time someone laughed and said: ""How can you major in English and Biology? How does that even work?"" Lets just say, I would have a lot of quarters. Paul was not only a brilliant doctor, author, and teacher, but he was also a wonderful husband and father. Reading about his interpretations of the world, and what he was going through, was beyond pleasurable and I would recommend this novel to anyone/everyone.Overall, I'm extremely pleased to have picked this up so randomly. Though, now that I think about it, there probably was a reason that I randomly began reading it. I learned so much about myself through Paul's words and observations, and I thank him for that. I really do."

Bolaño, müzmin ve ilerleyici karaciğer hastalığı ile birlikte yaklaşık on yıl yaşayabilmişti. Bu süre, ailesinin geleceğini düşünerek can havliyle yazdığı olağanüstü romanlara ve öyk��lere yetmiş, dehası yazdıkça perçinlenen yazar, yaşarken Latin Amerika edebiyatının yeni azizi olarak kutsanmış, dünyaca tanınmıştı. Şöhretin tadını röportaj sorularına hafif ve alaycı cevaplar vererek çıkardı. Genç okurlara ve yazarlara tatlı sert tavsiyeler verdi. Çekirdeğini oluşturan bohem şairi koruyup kolladı; cesur ve umursamazdı. Elli yıl uzunluğundaki yaşam kitabının son cümlesine geldiğinde, karaciğer nakli sıra numarası pusulasında ‘3’ yazıyordu.Geçtiğimiz günlerde, genç ve başarılı bir beyin cerrahı olan Paul Kalanithi’nin Son Nefes Havaya Karışmadan isimli anlatısını okudum. Derinden etkilendim. Kalanithi elbette büyük bir yazar değildi, hevesli bir amatördü. Dilini üslubunu olgunlaştıracak kadar zamanı da yoktu. Bu kitabı özgün ve değerli kılan, hatta biraz daha ileri gideyim, ‘bütün insanlara bir mektup’ yapan şey başkaydı. Paul, doktorluk kariyerinin en parlak günlerine yaklaşırken akciğer kanseri olduğunu öğrenmişti. Teşhisiyle ölümü arasında geçen birkaç yılı, cerrah kimliğinin buz gibi kesinliğiyle analiz etmiş, kanser hastası olarak duygularının bütün şiddetiyle yaşamış, yetenekli bir genç yazar olarak bu tezatların beslediği her cümlenin hakkını başarıyla vererek kaleme almıştı. Kitap basit kurgusuna rağmen beklendiği gibi içten ve gerçek (burada bir parantez açıp yarım kalmış olduğunu söylemeli), beklenmedik ölçüde cesur ve aydınlıktı. Bence bu nitelikleriyle bir edebiyat işi olmanın dışına çıkıp bütün insanlara bir mektup oluyordu. İsyan etmeden, duygu sömürüsü yapmadan ve korkutmadan, bir tür bilgelikle konuşan Doktor Kalanithi, bizi yaşamın sonunu, William Faulkner’ın o vurucu deyimiyle ‘Büyük Bilinmez’i düşünmeye çağırıyordu; ama yaşamı bütün gücümüzle, coşkuyla kucaklayabilelim diye.Kitabın Giriş bölümü teşhisle ilgili. Paul’un genç bir adam ve doktor olarak portresini, içindeki cesaret cevherini görmemizi sağlayan bir belirteç oluyor bu teşhis.İlk bölüm Sapasağlam Başlıyorum; aslında beni en çok etkileyen bölüm oldu. Aile, çocukluk, ilk gençlik, ilk hevesler, okul, aşk, sanat… Yaşamın anlamını aramak? Geriye dönüp kendisini bekleyen gelecekten habersiz küçük Paul’u tanımak ve onun tıbbı seçmesinin ardındaki kişisel meseleyi görmek sarsıcıydı. Büyük bir edebiyat ve felsefe sevgisiyle yanıp tutuşan genç Paul, eğer yaşamın anlamını bulabilecekse, bütün bu içeriği doğuran beyne bakması gerektiğine inanmıştı. Türümüzün gelişmiş aklının, mucizevi yaratıcılığının, yaşama getirdiği estetik, dramatik, mizahi yorumların bilimle, özellikle biyolojiyle bir ilgisi olmalıydı. Bu düşünce Paul’u o beyinleri açmaya ve asıl sanatını orada icra etmeye kadar götürecekti. Paul aynı dönemde, etrafındaki gizemi çözülemez belirsizlik bulutuyla onu hep büyüleyen ölüm üzerine de çok kafa yormuştu. Yaşamı karşıtıyla birlikte düşünmeden anlama olanağı yoktu çünkü. Ve o da kalkıp Paul’u ziyarete gelecekti. Kendini bizzat anlatmak için.İkinci ve son bölüm Ölünceye Kadar Durma adını taşıyor. Ayrıntıları okura bırakıp ‘kahramanca, hatta süper kahramanca bir mücadele öyküsü’ diyebilirim; ya da gerçek bir cesaret öyküsü. Boyun eğmemek, tedavi sürerken cerrahlığa geri dönebilecek ölçüde toparlanmak, bunu tüm fiziksel zorluklara rağmen çelik gibi bir iradeyle başarabilmek. Ve en güzeli, baba olmak. Ölünceye Kadar Durma, yarım kalan bölüm. Aslında Paul’e kitabı yazdıran akciğer kanseri, kitabın yarım kalmasını da istemiş olsa gerek. Belki böylesi daha iyidir. Bakarsak, bize sınırlı yaşamımızda her şeyin biraz yarım olduğunu, yarım kalacağını ve bunun büsbütün anlamsız olmadığını gösterebilir. Kitabı bitirdiğinizde bu yarım kalış, net bir tamamlanmışlık duygusu verecek size de, eminim. Sonsöz bölümünü Paul’un eşi Lucy Kalanithi yazmış.

Paul’un anlam arayışına başladığı yerleri tanıyan bir biyolog olarak okudum. Okumaya ve yazmaya fena halde düşkün bir edebiyatsever olarak okudum. Ölümün şakalaştığı bir adam olarak, bir eş, bir baba olarak okudum ve sevdim. Tavsiye ederim.Bolaño haklı. Kitapların birer sonu olmasaydı, asıl o zaman okumazdık onları; tıpkı sonsuz bir yaşam gibi anlamlarını kaybedeceklerini bilirdik."
119,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4403102-karan-bajaj,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've found books in the same genre of young folks facing their sudden mortality a little full of platitudes and false bravado so I was on the fence about picking up When Breath Becomes Air. But I read an excellent review from a reviewer I greatly respect on Goodreads so I bought it. This is a profound read, deeper than any other book in the genre, and searingly honest. Paul was extremely vulnerable with his own insecurities and doubts in the face of mortality despite being a lifelong philosopher. Yet it fell short of giving a glimpse of the pure transcendence that I thought Paul was close to uncovering. His conclusions in the end--family, meaningful work, striving, love--were almost too logical. I wanted to know a deeper insight that shimmers just below the surface and becomes accessible when all dross is stripped off from the soul. Ultimately, that's not the book's shortcoming as much as mine. I want answers from a universe that doesn't give them easily. Paul asked the right questions and perhaps that's enough."
120,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16450117-nhi-nguy-n,Rating 5 out of 5,"Tôi biết đến cuốn sách này lần đầu tiên với chỉ vài dòng thông tin tóm tắt: đây là cuốn tự truyện của một vị bác sĩ tên là Paul Kalanithi, bị chẩn đoán mắc bệnh ung thư phổi khi chỉ mới 36 tuổi (mặc dù anh không bao giờ hút thuốc), và qua đời 2 năm sau đó. Lần lữa mãi từ khi chỉ mới có bản tiếng Anh, rồi đến khi có bản dịch tiếng Việt, cũng xuất bản được khá lâu rồi, đến bây giờ tôi mới quyết định đọc cuốn sách này. Có lẽ tất cả là cơ duyên, khi tôi đang gặp phải những rắc rối, lo âu trong cuộc sống của mình, cùng những trăn trở, suy tư về ý nghĩa cuộc sống trước mắt. Cuốn sách này đến như một lẽ tự nhiên, một nhu cầu tìm kiếm lời giải đáp, hay chỉ đơn giản là nhu cầu cảm thụ một nỗi bi kịch mà đã từ lâu rồi tôi chưa cảm nhận được thông qua sách vở.“When Breath Becomes Air” bắt đầu bằng nỗi đau, nỗi đau của một người bạn không kịp dành nhiều thời gian cho Paul trước khi anh qua đời, cùng sự xoa dịu nỗi đau đó khi biết rằng Paul vẫn còn hiện diện nơi đây, thông qua những câu chữ mà anh đã viết để làm nên cuốn sách này - di sản của anh để lại. Nỗi đau đó kéo dài cho đến những miêu tả tỉ mỉ, như thể không bao giờ quên được, cái khoảng thời gian Paul bắt đầu xuất hiện những dấu hiệu của bệnh ung thư, những ngờ vực, rồi lại tự trấn an bản thân, cuối cùng là cái kết quả chẩn đoán vĩnh viễn thay đổi những ước mơ và kế hoạch mà chàng bác sĩ đầy tâm huyết đã vẽ nên cùng người vợ Lucy của mình. Rồi mọi thứ tạm lắng khi anh tái hiện lại hành trình trở thành người bác sĩ mà anh đã trở thành cho độc giả trải nghiệm, cái khoảng thời gian từ khi anh còn bé, cho đến khi học đại học, những định hướng nghề nghiệp cho bản thân.Xuyên suốt khoảng thời gian ấy, hay chính xác hơn là cả khoảng thời gian ngắn ngủi Paul đã sống trên cõi đời, anh luôn trăn trở đi tìm câu trả lời cho câu hỏi về mối liên hệ giữa bộ não với những gì làm nên một con người: các mối quan hệ, tình cảm, cảm xúc… Để rồi cuối cùng, chàng sinh viên đam mê văn chương, với tấm bằng Thạc sĩ Văn học Anh và Cử nhân Sinh học cơ thể người đó đã quyết định chọn khoa Ngoại thần kinh (neurosurgery), với trung tâm là bộ não - bộ phận kỳ diệu nhất, mang tính chi phối nhất và cũng đầy bí ẩn nhất của cơ thể con người - làm hướng đi cho mình. Thông qua ngôn từ của một bác sĩ kiêm nhà văn, Paul đã dựng lại một cách sống động khoảng thời gian anh làm Bác sĩ Nội trú (Residency) - khoảng thời gian thử thách kinh hoàng và áp lực ghê gớm mà bất cứ sinh viên Y khoa nào cũng phải trải qua để có thể chính thức trở thành Bác sĩ. Làm Bác sĩ Nội trú cho Paul những trải nghiệm vượt xa giới hạn của giảng đường và những cuốn sách y khoa, nơi mà ý nghĩa của cái nghề anh đã chọn, câu trả lời anh hằng tìm kiếm về ý nghĩa cuộc sống, vai trò và nhiệm vụ của người bác sĩ đối với bệnh nhân đã dần dần hiện ra trước mắt anh như một sự mặc khải. Đó là nơi mà nhiều khi sự bắt đầu và kết thúc cuộc đời con người chỉ cách nhau một bức tường bệnh viện, là nơi mà Paul nhận ra, trong rất nhiều trường hợp, bác sĩ không nên cố gắng cứu vãn những gì đã an bài. Trong ngành nghề phải chứng kiến cái chết nhiều cũng như chứng kiến sự sống, đôi lúc, bác sĩ phải là nhà sứ giả của tử thần, hỗ trợ một cách tối đa cho bệnh nhân cùng người nhà đón nhận cái chết. Và đồng thời, bác sĩ còn phải là người giúp bệnh nhân nhận ra đâu mới là ý nghĩa đích thực của cuộc sống, và giúp bệnh nhân bảo toàn “nhân dạng” của mình giữa khoảng thời gian khó khăn của bệnh tật.Khoảng thời gian Paul làm Bác sĩ Nội trú khiến tôi lập tức liên tưởng ngay đến bộ phim truyền hình của đài FOX mang tên “The Resident” (vừa mới coi tập đầu trên kênh Fox Life tối qua). Bộ phim khắc họa một cách chân thực cuộc sống và công việc của những bác sĩ nội trú, những giằng xé, khó khăn, trăn trở mà họ phải đối mặt hàng ngày. Cuộc sống của bác sĩ nội trú Paul Kalanithi cùng các đồng nghiệp của mình cũng như thế, cũng đầy những rủi ro không biết trước được của ngành y, cũng đầy những quyết định phải đưa ra trong vài tích tắc - những tích tắc có thể quyết định sự sống hay là cái chết của bệnh nhân. Tôi nhớ có câu nói của nhân vật trong phim, đại ý là nếu nghề y dễ dàng thì cả thế giới đã đi học y rồi, vì đây là nghề tuyệt vời nhất. Đúng vậy, cái cảm giác cứu được một sinh mạng nào đó đúng là cảm giác thỏa mãn nhất thế gian. Nhưng thực tế thì nghề y đồng thời cũng là một trong những nghề khó nhất, đòi hỏi không chỉ kiến thức, kỹ năng mà còn cả sức lực để có thể chèo chống cùng bệnh nhân giữa lằn ranh sự sống và cái chết.Tôi cực kỳ ngưỡng mộ cái cách mà Paul nhìn nhận nghề nghiệp của mình, nhìn nhận công việc mình làm không chỉ đơn thuần là công việc, và bệnh nhân cũng không chỉ đơn thuần là một vấn đề cần phải giải quyết. Trong mắt Paul, nghề y mà anh đã lựa chọn là sứ mạng thiêng liêng, là “tiếng gọi đích thực” (true calling), là mục đích cao cả mà anh sẽ dành cả đời để cống hiến. Nếu như bạn đến với ngành y chỉ vì muốn kiếm nhiều tiền, thì mọi thứ sẽ rất đơn giản, chỉ cần tốt nghiệp, đi làm vài năm rồi mở phòng mạch tư, mỗi ngày khám chừng 15 - 20 bệnh nhân là tha hồ hốt bạc mà không phải chịu căng thẳng, áp lực hay đối mặt với những câu hỏi rất khó tìm lời giải về sự sống và cái chết, về niềm tin, về hy vọng, về ý nghĩa đích thực của việc hành nghề y. Lẽ dĩ nhiên, vì công cuộc mưu sinh, phần lớn con người ta sẽ chọn việc nào giúp họ kiếm nhiều tiền một cách nhanh chóng và dễ dàng, chưa kể lương cứng của bác sĩ ở VN (nước ngoài thì không rõ nhé) chỉ chừng 5 triệu/tháng là cao. Điều ấy khiến cho những người bác sĩ như Paul trở thành những con người với tâm hồn và suy nghĩ đáng quý, đáng để trân trọng, để giữ gìn và tôn vinh. Nhưng đáng tiếc thay, và đau lòng thay, tâm hồn ấy, suy nghĩ ấy đã không thể có được sự hỗ trợ từ một cơ thể khỏe mạnh để có thể tiếp tục cống hiến cho đời. Từ vị trí là một bác sĩ, Paul trở thành bệnh nhân, vào cái khoảnh khắc anh nằm trên giường bệnh, nắm tay người vợ Lucy, lắng nghe một vị bác sĩ khác phân tích tấm phim chụp CT buồng phổi chứa đầy khối u của anh. Cái khoảnh khắc ấy đánh dấu một bước ngoặt đau đớn, một sự thay đổi vĩnh viễn tất cả những gì đã và đang diễn ra trong cuộc sống của Paul Kalanithi. Bỗng chốc, anh nhận ra, việc nghĩ đến tương lai là điều bất khả, và tất cả những gì anh có thể lo lắng là bữa trưa tiếp theo của mình. Những dự định cho tương lai, một mái nhà, một tổ ấm, những đứa con, thậm chí là “nhân dạng” của anh, giờ đây bỗng thuộc về Paul của quá khứ. Anh là ai sau cái chẩn đoán khủng khiếp này? Liệu anh có còn là một Bác sĩ Phẫu thuật thần kinh? Một người chồng? Một nhà văn, hay chỉ đơn thuần là một bệnh nhân ung thư, đang từng ngày từng giờ chống chọi với cái chết?Chương II của cuốn sách đưa người đọc đến với quãng thời gian khi Paul điều trị ung thư, trong lúc cố gắng tiếp tục cống hiến hết sức có thể cho mục đích cao cả của mình bằng việc trở lại thực hiện những ca mổ thần kinh. Song song với đó là những cảm nhận của anh, về thời gian, về cuộc sống, về niềm tin tôn giáo, những suy nghĩ mang tính triết học, được gợi nên bên trong vị bác sĩ giờ đây đang trải qua những gì mà bệnh nhân của anh từng trải qua. Và cùng lúc, Paul đảm nhận cả cương vị bệnh nhân lẫn bác sĩ; anh vừa lắng nghe những đề xuất chữa bệnh của Emma Hayward - bác sĩ trị ung thư (oncologist) của anh - đồng thời anh cũng đưa ra những đề xuất của riêng mình. Cái chết thì vẫn hiển hiện như một bóng ma lởn vởn, nhưng đồng thời cũng là cả sự sống, sự sống hình thành từ công nghệ thụ tinh trong ống nghiệm, đã mang đến cho Paul và Lucy bé Cady - con gái của hai người - giữa thời khắc mà dường như sự sống của Paul sẽ không kéo dài lâu nữa.Ai rồi cũng phải chết, chẳng cần phải là bác sĩ mới biết được điều này. Nhưng Paul không ngờ, thời điểm mà anh chết lại có thể sớm một cách bất ngờ như thế. Tôi khóc trước cái cảnh người cha ôm ấp cô con gái bé bỏng của mình, cố gắng thu nhặt những khoảng thời gian ít ỏi trước lúc ra đi và biến nó trở thành khoảng thời gian vui tươi nhất, đẹp đẽ nhất bằng tình yêu dành cho đứa con mà anh sẽ không có mặt ở đó để chứng kiến những tháng năm trưởng thành. Tôi khóc khi đọc đến đoạn Vĩ thanh (Epilogue) được viết bởi Lucy Kalanithi, vợ của anh, miêu tả một cách sống động và xót xa những ngày cuối đời của Paul, khi anh đã không còn đủ sức lực để chống chọi lại căn bệnh ung thư. Khi anh đã sẵn sàng để ra đi, để bác sĩ rút máy thở, và dành khoảng thời gian ngắn ngủi còn lại với gia đình ở bên, đối mặt với cái kết thúc không thể vãn hồi. Và cuối cùng, như người vợ của Paul đã viết, anh có lẽ đã tìm thấy ý nghĩa của cuộc sống ở những tháng ngày cuối cùng này, ý nghĩa của việc không sợ hãi cái chết, của việc nhìn thẳng vào nó, chấp nhận nó, và sống một cách trọn vẹn nhất có thể khoảng thời gian mình còn sống trên cõi đời.Một số người chọn cách sống với mục đích kiếm thật nhiều tiền để hưởng thụ cho thật đã trong kiếp sống này. Điều đó chả có gì sai, vì như người ta thường nói, bạn chỉ có một cuộc đời để sống. Thế nhưng, theo quan điểm của tôi, cuộc sống, rốt cuộc, không chỉ nên dừng lại ở việc kiếm tiền và hưởng thụ. Cuộc sống còn nên là cơ hội để bạn để lại dấu ấn của riêng mình cho hậu thế; đó là di sản mà nhờ nó, bạn sẽ luôn được nhớ về. Và trong mắt tôi, Paul Kalanithi đã làm được điều đó; cuốn sách này, cùng với bé Cady, chính là di sản của anh, là những thứ sẽ tồn tại để nhắc mọi người nhớ về anh. Đó là những bản thể mà ở đó, tâm hồn của anh, phẩm chất của anh sẽ luôn sống mãi. Chữ viết và nghề viết văn có ảnh hưởng đến thế đấy, vì trừ phi bị đốt bỏ, chữ viết và sách vở sẽ luôn là bằng chứng lưu giữ sự tồn tại về trí tuệ, cảm xúc và suy nghĩ của một người. Thông qua cuốn sách này, Cady Kalanithi sẽ dựng được hình dung về người cha mà số phận khắc nghiệt đã không cho thêm nhiều thời gian để ở bên cô. Và cũng thông qua cuốn sách này, Lucy Kalanithi sẽ luôn giữ bên mình một phần nào đó của người chồng đã mất, người mà cô luôn yêu và sẽ không bao giờ ngừng yêu, dẫu anh đã ra đi mãi mãi.P.S.: Tôi đọc bản gốc tiếng Anh mặc dù bản dịch tiếng Việt đã được xuất bản. Lý do là tôi không hiểu vì sao, một cuốn sách chỉ chừng 230 trang mà giá tiền của nó lại lên đến 105,000 VNĐ. Hồi đi Hội sách công viên Lê Văn Tám, cầm bản dịch tiếng Việt lên coi giá, rồi coi qua số trang mà muốn hết hồn luôn. Lúc đầu tôi cứ nghĩ cuốn này phải từ 300 trang trở lên cơ. Cứ cho là do dịch thuật cuốn này rất vất vả, vì bản gốc gồm rất nhiều từ ngữ chuyên ngành y khoa; cứ cho là có thể, lợi nhuận bán cuốn sách này sẽ được đóng góp vào các tổ chức nghiên cứu bệnh ung thư/giúp đỡ bệnh nhân ung thư. Nếu thực sự định giá cao, thu lợi nhuận nhiều và số tiền đó đến được tay dịch giả, đến được với những tổ chức ý nghĩa như thế, thì tôi sẵn sàng bỏ tiền ra mua bản dịch với giá gốc để ủng hộ. Nhưng nếu chỉ là kiểu hét giá cho cao để bòn rút tiền của độc giả thì xin thôi, đọc bản gốc sướng hơn. Độc giả cũng phải đi làm sấp mặt mới có tiền mua sách, và không phải chỉ đọc mỗi cuốn này. Dẫu biết ngành xuất bản VN còn nhiều khó khăn, nhưng nếu vì lấy lý do khó khăn đó mà đưa ra cái giá cao một cách vô lý như thế thì nên xem lại."
121,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149694522-karen,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read this before my mother passed away almost 5 years ago. I remember how sad I felt about his diagnosis of cancer, and yet, how moved I was by his courage. This man was so inspiring to me. His book was moving, even though there was much to read about what he was personally experiencing was heart-breaking and obviously fatal. Because…We have a young, once vibrant 36-year-old non-smoker, neurosurgeon with lung cancer. He was a rising star at Stanford University School of Medicine when he first began to experience weight loss, and severe back pain that led him to see a fellow physician which would reveal multiple tumors and his diagnosis. In that single moment, he writes, “the future I imagined, the one just about to be realized, the culmination of decades of striving, evaporated.” As readers, we can’t help but feel his heartbreak, too. Because this diagnosis not only stole his future, it stole his identity. He asks, “Who would I be, going forward, and for how long?” How many times in life have we gone through a life introspection? The why am I here – where do I want to go now? What am I meant to do now? Kinds of questions. We are given great insights into his medical training, his steady diet of literature, his learned background, his contemplative disposition and his kindness. Many times, we understand that some doctors want to become doctors for the money, status, and what they can gain from their position. For him, he wanted to “forge relationships with the suffering, and to keep following the question of what makes humans life meaningful, even in the face of death and decay.” And now what about his own? Here he is as a patient. His words are endearing for his honesty. We watch him persevere through tortuous chemo treatments. But he was unable to finish the book. His wife, Lucy wrote the epilogue, and finished the manuscript. Even Abraham Verghese’ foreword adds some perspective to the first-person account.There are so many moments in the book. Kleenex please. Holding his child for the first time, as he lies on a cot in the same hospital room where his wife has just given birth to their daughter, he writes, “the possibilities of life emanated before us.” And yet, a few pages later he says we are reminded that only memory and words, “have a longevity I do not.” Please…Pass the Kleenex. 4.5 stars"

I stayed up late the past two nights reading it while in bed. As I put my Kindle on the bedside table last night I had tears in my eyes.Paul passed away on March 9, 2015 at age 37. He was a Stanford-trained neurosurgeon and writer. He was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer in 2013, though he never smoked. He was married to Lucy (Goddard) Kalanithi who sounds like an amazing woman. When he died he had an infant daughter Cady. His family was extremely close to him.I know Paul’s brother Jeevan Kalanithi. Jeevan co-founded Sifteo, which we invested in with True Ventures. Sifteo’s products were critically acclaimed but not commercially successful and was acquired by 3D Robotics, which we are also investors in with True Ventures. Jeevan is Chief Product Officer at 3D Robotics and has done an awesome job. And, more importantly, is an amazing person.So, as I read Paul’s book, while I didn’t know him, I felt like I had a sense of him through knowing Jeevan. I read Paul’s New Yorker Essay My Last Day as a Surgeon which was published after he died. Read it you want a taste of Paul’s writing, genius, empathy, beauty, and authenticity. Now, imagine an entire book like this. Read his essay Before I Go for another taste. Or try How Long Have I Got Left? which was published in the New York Times a year before he died.If you haven’t yet bought When Breath Becomes Air, please go do it now. It’s #1 on the New York Times bestseller list for a reason. It might be the most powerful book about being human, being mortal, learning about, confronting, dealing with, and ultimately accepting one’s own mortality. It’s beautifully written – almost poetic in its rhythm – and aggressively real. There is no prognosticating, no rationalizing, no baloney – just real, raw feelings throughout the book.And it ends suddenly. Paul dies. Unlike so many things that we hear about that are tied up nicely in a bow, life – and death – doesn’t really work this way. And Paul helps us understand this by taking us through his journey.When I was in my mid 20s, struggling with depression and having paranoid fears about being deathly ill, my therapist recommended I read Norman Cousins book Anatomy of an Illness: As Perceived by the Patient. It changed me fundamentally and shifted my relationship with my own mortality. It didn’t eliminate my depression, but it helped me understand how my viewpoint impacted my physiology, and how important this was in healing.Paul’s book takes this to a new level. Like Cousins, it’s deeply personal, but by being current, it’s more accessible. And for me, more powerful.Thank you Paul for writing this book. And thank you to Paul’s family for bringing it into the world."

127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7619789-leo-robertson,Rating 2 out of 5,"I struggle to understand what anyone got out of this. I found the writing pretentious and saccharine and I was also irritated that I wasn't really supposed to be feeling this because I was supposed to be all weepy or some shit, and I wasn't allowed to feel it because it's rude to feel that about the prose of the deceased, a principle of etiquette I invented when reading this, applied to myself and then I judged myself for deviating from it.My mum was terminally ill for I think 9/18 months she was given. Other sad shit happened to me—though I would hardly put it in a book and pretend you had to read it! (Fuck, I'm SO Rude. Better luck next year)—and I tend to think other people's experience of sad stuff is equal or greater to mine and it's actually a nice way to live: you err on the side of compassion and get pleasantly surprised if people are like 'Nope: got both parents! #Sux2BU'—so what I mean is, reading this, I assumed everyone either had or will have someone close to them who will wrestle through this situation, and it teaches you way more than this book ever could. So I suppose it's a supplement for those people who haven't had that experience. This sounds like I'm gloating but how the hell could I gloat about a thing like this? If I am, Jesus! Let me have it. Also, why bother to put yourself through this now? Every single one of us gets out of bed in the morning because we've planned to deal with death when we come to it. Death: the ultimate deadline to procrastinate!The mechanics of enjoying this book I think also must be prurient to some degree—they always must be in cases of books like these. The first half is that whole, 'Be thankful you have legs because this 12 year-old got some wild disease you've never heard of—isn't life terrifying?!' You know, that whole weird phase we exercised when the TV serieses House et al were popular. There's really nothing to learn from that.One of the most important lessons about the author's situation is that no one ultimately gets a free pass in life. That being the case, why should I pay particular attention to this dying man's document over anyone else's? Is this a unique, interesting account of someone struggling with his circumstances? I guess it's rarer than most. When Still Alice the film came out, people got mad that it seemed to suggest it was sadder to get Alzheimer's if you were younger. I don't know about that but the same applies here, sorta. (I'm not using my whole brain on this because I didn't like it.) Then people must like it because the guy was well-read and kept making literary references (which, by the way, I will not even forgive a dying man for, because I FUCKING HATE that)? That he was trained as a neurosurgeon, so... so?The only insight that appeared original was that statistics don't offer relief from the inevitability of death, which is the opposite of what I posted in a blog last week or something. Of course they do: knowing I'm more likely to die at 80 than tomorrow allows me to indulge in petty arguments for decades. And I'm gonna!Sorry, mate. You had a tough run, and as you say, life doesn't afford you concessions. I sure don't. I hold out for better luck but don't demand or expect it. What can you do, really?Read better books."

131,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78854108-gil,Rating 2 out of 5,"2 ""Well, this is awkward"" stars...Before anything, I'd like to preface this review with some context. Around the time that I picked this up, one of my family members had been living with cancer for about a year. Like many people, I thought it was something that only happened in the movies - I didn't think it would happen to me. So I didn't know how to make sense of the experience. I was feeling confused, trapped, and terrified, and I wanted to read something that would help me understand what I was going through. It was around this time that I stumbled on Mr. Kalanithi's memoir, and at the time I thought it was extremely timely.Unfortunately, while I respect the effort that Mr. Kalanithi put into this work, and while I deeply empathise with his family for their loss, I can't bring myself to say that I liked this book, or that it resonated with my family's experience. This is one of those times where I'm not sure if I read the same book as everyone else. Instead of striking me as being emotional and profound, this book struck me as dry and pretentious. I felt like I was listening to someone detailing his accomplishments and lofty ideals in a bid to prove to other people that he's worthy of being remembered after his death.For example, at the beginning of the memoir, we learn that Mr. Kalanithi has had a fairly privileged life. He grew up reading all the classics under the eye of an intelligent and well-read mother with great ambitions for her children. He's gone to a string of Ivy League schools - Stanford, Cambridge, and Yale - and earned degrees in literature and philosophy. However, he decided to go to medicine afterwards, because it was only through practicing medicine that he could ""pursue a serious biological philosophy"" (p. 43) and give up ""[puny] moral speculation"" in favor of ""moral action"". Further along, he writes, ""I was pursuing medicine to bear witness to the twinned mysteries of death, its experiential and biological manifestations: at once deeply personal and utterly impersonal"" (p. 53).Such abstractions have their place in philosophical tracts, but not in memoirs. If there are any abstractions at all, like the extracts quoted above, I would expect them to be hard-earned and grounded in the author's own experience. But because of the paucity of intimate detail in the renderings of his experiences, these abstractions came across as precisely just 'puny moral speculation' - just empty talk about his noble ideals.This might also have something to do with his style. To use the old creative writing adage, Mr. Kalanithi has a tendency to 'tell' rather than 'show', so he captures all the broad-strokes of his experiences as a doctor and a patient but none of the specificity that I usually look for in memoirs. Also, some people have called his writing 'beautiful', but personally I found his sentences flowery, overwritten, and clunky with self-importance. It felt like he was vacillating between writing an academic paper and a piece that would impress a bunch of MFA students.The one part that I loved about this book was his wife's epilogue. I cried when I read it; it was what I hope this memoir could have been. Ms. Lucy Kalanithi's sentences were spare, but each scene she wrote about from her life with Mr. Kalanithi were limned with intimacy, affection, and grief. It was in the epilogue that I learned about the kind of person Mr. Kalanithi really was, and felt the pain of his family at losing him.All that being said, I'm definitely the minority here (much to my distress, since I didn't expect to be), so I would still recommend this to people grappling with grief. I think the fact that so many others loved this book is proof that Mr. Kalanithi's memoir is more likely than not to resonate with someone on a similar journey. However, I'd also like to recommend Nina Riggs's The Bright Hour: A Memoir of Living and Dying or Atul Gawande's Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End, both of which I'd picked up around the same time, and both of which had been more personally meaningful to me."

Years of preparation and study were about to pay off as Paul was gearing up for his future as his graduation drew closer. But life had other plans. Paul went from a neurosurgeon full of compassion and potential to a patient with an unknown amount of life left. As Paul was trying to navigate his new life, he kept looking for the best use of the time he had left. In the end, he decided to write and reflect. This is his story.This is a short book but do not be deceived by the length. This book packs a punch. Paul Kalanithi was staring at his mortality straight on with every word that he wrote. Paul had degrees in Biology, Science and English. All throughout his upbringing and education, he pondered on the meaning of life. Ultimately deciding that being a doctor would give him the best view, he chose neurosurgery. Paul worked extensively and already had big plans upon finishing his residency. This is a beautiful memoir. Its sad yet uplifting. Paul does not seek pity, he wanted to impart evrything he had learned on this journey. In doing so, he celebrated his life and gave us an insight into how to enjoy our own in the best way possible. I love the introduction by Abraham Verghese but I was absolutely taken in by the afteward written by his wife (and fellow doctor) Lucy Kalanithi. I knew the outcome and yet I hoped Paul would recover. Dr. Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015 (22 months since being diagnosed), which was not just great loss to his family but also to the medical profession. But he left a great legacy behind, one that one day his daughter will be very proud of. Heartfelt, profound, emotional, poetic and inspiring this is a book I would recommend to everyone. It will stick with for a long while."

139,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20035507-nanci,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book, as I see it, has three parts. The first part, written by Abraham Verghese, does not do the book any favors. He writes as if he's using a thesaurus for every other word and has little emotion for what is a very emotional and personal memoir. I do not feel this foreward works at all for the book and actually put me off from wanting to continue to read it.  The second part, written by the author himself is a bit verbose and at times tedious to read. It seems he tries too hard to impress his readers with his writing skills, and just ends up coming across as rather cold and conceited. Paul Kalanithi, had a life long desire to be a writer, but he just doesn't have it. This is a shame, because his story about his diagnosis and how he handles his impending death has great merit.The third part of the book is the epilogue written by his wife, Lucy. She is a doctor too, but she's the real writer. She is a natural and just gets it. Lucy is the one who helped me feel empathy for her husband and grow to like him as a person. If I were rating the book on her writing I would have given it 4 stars. "

142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49577504-george,Rating 2 out of 5,"""When Breath Becomes Air"" by Paul Kalanithi is a short memoir written by a 36-year old doctor as he was dying of cancer. It also includes an epilogue written by his wife after he had died.  Paul and his family seem like nice people. They did not deserve the tragedy of Paul's untimely death from cancer. It's difficult for me to give a less than favorable review of this memoir because I know Paul spent the last year of his life struggling to complete this book. Yet, I would describe the book (not Paul's life) as just OK - not terrible but also not that good. I think an article or blog post would have been enough - rather than a full-length book. Ultimately, there just wasn't enough evidence of personal or spiritual transformation in this memoir for me to give it a strong recommendation.  It seems the reason many people like this book is because they have a fascination with doctors. It's why television shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"" are so popular. If the doctor becomes a cancer patient, that fascination is doubled. If Paul had been a construction worker or a bus driver I don't think this book would be very popular.  I'll conclude with a few positive thoughts: First, reading this book can give you insight into the process of suffering from cancer. It can also help you reflect upon the experience of letting go of a dream (in Paul's case it was his dream of being a doctor). And finally, reading this book can inspire you to reflect upon the shortness of your own life.

I opened this book knowing the outcome. It is no secret that he lost his life to cancer. If there’s a secret, or a reason to read his story, it’s how he spent his time between diagnosis and final breath. Writing this book is an example. It was not left in fear of being forgotten, as if he worried that it his name would not be known. He did not. While still in school, learning to be a doctor, Kalanithi says, “I was driven less by achievement than by trying to understand, in earnest: What makes human life meaningful.”  For most people, I would chalk that up to the idealism of youth, but he followed through on this thought. If his time as a neurosurgeon didn’t prove that, then the many that miss him and loved him certainly does. As his wife Lucy says in the epilogue, ”Writing this book was a chance for this courageous seer to be a sayer, to teach us to face death with integrity.” I turned the final pages thinking I would feel a sense of sorrow, but I think a better word would be impassioned."

Не е книга за хипохондрици, накратко.Второ, не знам до колко стана ясно той дали е намерил въпросния смисъл на живота и не мисля, че бидейки лекар и пациент му е помогнало да се срещане по-спокойно със смъртта.

Cancer is mulititude of diseases, but most have this in common: it strikes the old. Yet the author is only in his 30's, nearing the end of his neurosurgical residency, when he is diagnosed. Paul has been dealing with terminally ill patients and suddenly finds himself on the other side. He faces the facts bravely. We all know we are going to die, it's just our time frames that differ. To sidetrack a bit: in a philosophy class in highschool we had a geriatric professor discussing the difference between believing and knowing. How you can believe without knowing, but that the flip side, knowing without believing is far rarer. My 18-year old self glibly said that I knew I was going to die, but did not believe it. Denial was strong in my young self. Five years later I became suddenly gravely ill and having been forced to face my own mortality, changed the direction of my life forever. Do what you need to do now, you do not have forever."

When Breath Becomes Air is short and the immediacy and honesty of the writing does not require my review to supplement its contents. Kalanithi's journey from boyhood, through medical school, to his residency is contrasted with his experience as a patient and a man brought to face with his mortality. His writing is powerful, but never too heady as he muses on what it means to live through his ever approaching death. Though I'm keeping this short, I believe it is worth clearing up a misconception about this book. Kalanithi did not write When Breath Becomes Air to depress his audience. Rather, he wrote with a fury in his final days to contribute a life-affirming message to a wide audience. Highly recommended. "

The few words of wisdom, doled out from lives of the brave men who left us too soon,to tell us from beyond their grave,about their examined life and how to face death with integrity.A 36 year old intellectual Paul Kalanithi, wanted to tell a similar yet incredibly poignant story about leaving an indelible impression within limited time in context of cancer. The honesty in his writing will deliver its promise and take your breath away.The culmination of decades of striving the rigorous & demanding neurosurgical training to truly understand the physiological-spiritual man, a brilliant neurosurgeon learned a lot about the meaning of life, from examining the depth of doctor-patient relationship,to reaching the milestones, contributing in field of science.The author takes us to a journey of a young man, a lover of literature to become a well acclaimed neurosurgeon. The fragments of narrative is filled with right amount of medical details that he explained precisely to tell us his experience as a neurosurgeon, like Broca's and Wernicke's asphasia which I found very educational. He revealed his sense of being and gave many account of his accomplishments and about the responsibility of a neurosurgeon with its unforgiving call to perfection.Death has a weird way of knocking at your door when you least want it, the Paul who planned to do so much gets physically debilitated after his lung cancer diagnosis was confirmed. He felt helpless.Yet he managed to pull himself back to practice surgery when his condition stabilised with a treatment. But when death is after you, it's not so easy to resist it for long, his condition again worsen after all the 3 alternative failed to work on him.In an epilogue, his wife talks about the death of Paul, how his strength waned yet they continued to experience joyful moments, even in the midst of sorrows. She explained what was really the meaning of life, that introspective Paul was searching, to face death with dignity, one should be deeply in love - to be kind, vulnerable yet grateful.An unfinished nevertheless finished memoir which tried to make sense of how to best use the time left, when there was no way for him to know how limited it was, he surrendered to inevitability of death with courage, which was an emotionally riveting read for me, indeed what happened to Paul was tragic but he wasn't a tragedy and he proved it by profoundly influencing the lives of others even when he is no more.I have read few reviews that says that Paul was self-centered throughout the book, well I can't really judge when it's coming from a man with so much potential (there was no doubt it boasting was all true) who is now dying with excruciating pain yet some how manages to write, if he had more time, this book would have been among one of the best literary works.There were people thinking he was privileged enough to die a comfortable death, I can never agree to it, because to lose one of the world's best neurosurgeon with vision is nothing less than a tragedy.I will strongly recommend this book to everyone with its message that when you come to one of the many moments in life, where you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done and meant to world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man's days with sated joy, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied."

One could argue that these are some of the most quintessential things we can ask ourselves as humans and Paul Kalanithi does a great job of describing his thoughts and feelings on these questions in his memoir When Breath Becomes Air. He was extremely unlucky to be diagnosed with stage IV metastatic lung cancer when he was in his mid-30s and close to the peak of his career as a neurosurgeon, but never do we get the sense that he is bitter and angry about it. Instead, throughout the book there is stoicism and a rawness and honesty in his exploration of his own death and dying that is very touching and I was full of admiration for him.As a doctor, I had had some sense of what patients with life-changing illnesses faced – and it was exactly these moments I had wanted to explore with them. Shouldn’t terminal illness, then, be the perfect gift to that young man who had wanted to understand death? What better way to understand it than to live it? But I’d had no idea how hard it would be, how much terrain I would have to explore, map, settle. I’d always imagined the doctor’s work as something like connecting two pieces of railroad track, allowing a smooth journey for he patient. I hadn’t expected the prospect of facing my own mortality to be so disorienting, so dislocating. I thought back to my younger self, who might’ve wanted to “forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race”; looking into my own soul. I found the tools too brittle, the fire too weak, to forge even my own conscience.One of Paul’s main frustrations was not knowing how much time he had left and the reluctance of his treating oncologist to give him a timeframe….The way forward seems obvious, if only I knew how many months or years I had left. Tell me three months, I’d spend time with family. Tell me one year, I’d write a book. Give me ten years, I’d get back to treating diseases. The truth that you live one day at a time didn’t help: What was I supposed to do with that day?Paul Kalanithi lasted around twenty months after his diagnosis and passed away not long before his 38th birthday in March 2015. We’re left in no doubt that the birth of his daughter ‘Cady’ eight months before he died was the most meaningful thing in his life and the answer to those philosophical dilemmas he posed to himself and to us."

I was afraid it would be just too painful, too sad. After all, a 36 year old man, just finishing his training as a neurosurgeon, married and hoping to have a child, suddenly struck down with stage 4 lung cancer, a very rare diagnosis in someone so young.But curiosity finally won out and I'm glad it did. This is a beautiful book, about living as much as about dying. Kalanithi shows incredible courage and an ability to continue to give himself to life in the face of death. As he says, he wanted to spend his time living, not dying.This is a book about how to have a rich life, how to live deeply and with wonder, how to commit yourself to the world both within and without. Although it is of course very sad it was beautiful. Much of the book is devoted to Kalanithi's search to make meaning of life, both before his diagnosis and after. Kalanithi was torn between his love of literature and his fascination with the brain. His search for a meaningful life included his continuing confrontation with death even before his own illness in his connection with his patients. He wanted to understand all of human experience but especially how we live in the face of the fact that we all die. He tries to make of his own experience a further exploration of this theme.Reading this was a powerful experience which ignited my own desire to live fully and create meaningful connections with other people, the world, and my own self. This book is a guide to live, not just a story about dying."

The whole book is written with such brilliance that one just admires its author for who he is and how he lives through the crisis. As I read the last two paragraphs of the book, I almost cried. One can almost feel the pain, the goodness of those words. I also thought of how his daughter would read those words at a certain point. In the foreword, we are told about the brilliance of the last paragraph, however, I totally forgot about it while reading the book. Only after I finished the book, I read the foreword again for no particular reasons. Perhaps, I wanted to know more about him. The foreword writer is right about the book's strength and exquisiteness.The book shows us how precious each breath is, and what courage means.One reviewer Petra X wrote a rather misleading review of the book. The foreword by Abrahm is not contradictory as she claims. Strangely enough this reviewer goes on and on bashing Abrahm (the foreword writer) and also the author for their style, and for some unknown reasons compare them with Lucy's epilogue, and then repeatedly claims that Paul's wife is the better writer. One wonders why such a comparison. Epilogue or Foreword is not the book. While liking one style more than the other is a matter of personal choice. I would have ignored her review but I see that one cannot comment under her review which confirmed my view that she is doing something else than actually reviewing the book."

Paul was an extremely successful neurosurgeon who studied for years to become one of the top players in his area of medicine. Unfortunately, he was diagnosed with lung cancer in his early thirties and began a long process of trialling different methods to prolong his life. He was undoubtedly a talented man; he held a passion for literature and this comes across in his writing style. This memoir features a lot of complex words, both from a medical perspective and otherwise, which may be challenging for some readers. As a nurse myself, I did indeed learn about the complexities of cancer and how treatment effects the body and mind.How the author managed to return to work following his cancer diagnosis is astonishing.

When Breath Becomes Air is simply a collection of Paul Kalaithni's deep thoughts about life, death, existence and what really makes life meaningful.Paul first studied Literature and Philosophy in Stanford in hopes to get a better understanding of life, when he realized that he wasn't getting what he was looking for he thought what better way to understand the minds of humans other than studying the brain itself so he joined medical school in Yale then majored in neurosurgery , how rare are the people who are truly chasing after knowledge and wisdom and not good salaries or comfortable lives. Throughout the book Paul tells us his reflections about being a doctor and about illness and death through his contact with his terminally ill patients  and by being a stage four lung cancer patient himself  and why he really chose the field of neurosurgery.  ""While all doctors treat diseases, neurosurgeons work in the crucible of identity: every operation on the brain is, by necessity, a manipulation of the substance of our selves, and every conversation with a patient undergoing brain surgery cannot help but confront this fact. In addition, to the patient and family, the brain surgery is usually the most dramatic event they have ever faced and, as such, has the impact of any major life event. At those critical junctures, the question is not simply whether to live or die but what kind of life is worth living. Would you trade your ability—or your mother’s—to talk for a few extra months of mute life?""  Some thoughts of Paul hit me harder than I thought, I agreed with almost everything he wrote, I even asked myself the same questions he asked himself, not too long ago a very dear person to me had to do a major brain surgery, if I haven't faced that situation would I really have thought deeply about it? Would I have connected with this book as much as I did? I doubt it. Nobody REALLY thinks about life and what is really worth it, not until death pays you a personal visit that's when the truth hits you in the face..."

You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.
It's interesting, some books seemingly do everything right and yet you cannot get yourself to love them. This was the case for me with When Breath Becomes Air.The memoir tells the powerful story of Paul Kalanithi who dedicated years of his life to become a skilled neurosurgeon and then found himself sick with lung cancer at the age of 36. Paul reminisces on his life and his experiences which he shares with the reader in an incredibly candid way and it's truly inspiring. There is so much I - and all of us - can learn from him about life and death, showing empathy, and acknowledging that even if you can't understand what someone goes through, you should always take the time to listen to their story. The book paints a picture of what it means to be a doctor as well as a patient; it is raw and uplifting in a way that I didn't expect. Not only is the story important but it is also beautifully written. Paul Kalanithi is a skilled writer and he narrates in an elegant, effortless yet poetic prose that is meaningful without being pretentious. So how could I possibly only give this book 3 stars? I think part of the reason is that despite how much I've been branching out and trying different kinds of books and genres, memoirs just generally aren't for me. There are exceptions of course, but this book isn't one of them. But the main issue for me was that despite the fact that I rationally found this book to be important and meaningful, it didn't make me feel anything. I wasn't impacted in any way, it didn't touch me. Considering how much other people loved it I'm sure it's a me thing and not the fault of the book, but I just found the story to be somewhat lacking. However, I would still definitely recommend this book to the majority of readers. If you like literary fiction and/or memoirs, give it a try.Also, there are some stunning quotes in here.
Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.

Cred că doctorul Kalanithi a fost un OM deosebit, și mă bucur că și-a lăsat amprenta prin această carte. Da, poate că mă așteptam ca scrierea sa să fie mai mult axată pe viața de familie, pe emoție decât pe activitatea sa medicală, dar și așa, cred că toți medicii ar trebui să dea dovadă de aceeași pasiune pentru meseria lor. “Când ajungi într-unul dintre multele momente ale vieții în care trebuie să arăți cine ești, oferă un jurnal cu ceea ce ai fost, ai făcut și ai însemnat pentru lume. Te implor să nu ignori faptul că ai adus ultimelor zile ale unui muribund un preaplin de bucurie, o bucurie necunoscută mie în anii anteriori, o bucurie care nu tânjește după și mai multă bucurie, o bucurie care este satisfăcătoare și suficientă. În prezent, acum, este un lucru uriaș pentru mine.”“Poate că viața este doar o „clipă“, prea nesemnificativă ca să conteze.”“După atât de mult timp petrecut în preajma morții, ajunsesem să înțeleg că moartea cea mai ușoară nu este neapărat și cea mai bună.”“Datoria medicului nu este să împiedice moartea sau să le înapoieze pacienților vechea lor viață, ci să ia în brațe pacientul și familia ale căror vieți au fost dezintegrate și să lucreze cu ei până când se pot ridica pe picioarele lor și își pot înfrunta propria existență.”“Cunoașterea umană nu este conținută într-o singură persoană. Ea crește din relațiile pe care le creăm unii cu alții și cu lumea și nu este niciodată completă. Adevărul se situează deasupra a tot și toate, într-un loc unde, ca și la sfârșitul acelei predici de duminică, semănătorul și secerătorul se pot bucura împreună. „Căci în aceasta se adeverește cuvântul: Că unul este semănătorul și altul secerătorul. Eu v-am trimis să secerați ceea ce voi n-ați muncit; alții au muncit și voi ați intrat în munca lor.“”"

Paul is a 36 year old neurosurgeon who is just graduating from his residency when he finds out that he has stage IV lung cancer. We, as readers know how this will end before we even open the cover. The cloud that presses on you when go decide to read this book steeps down, and then slowly starts to recede before drowning you. When cancer has impacted your family personally, no story that involves cancer is easy to pick up. It hurts, it still hurts, it will always hurt. The book is separated into two main sections. Paul writes about his background, his choices, his schooling, and most importantly how he decides to treat every patient as a person, instead of a number. He talks to them, he explains to them, he asks them about themselves. He never shares the survival statistics. Pretty soon, Paul experiences debilitating pain in his back. As a Doctor, he knows what he happening but doesn't want to acknowledge it. Paul beautifully writes about medicine, about science, and literature. His life is fully lived and he grants us a brilliant glimpse into a legacy he is leaving behind. The epilogue, written by his wife, broke my heart.

The prologue of this book opens with him reading his CT scans and knowing exactly what the scans mean. He has lung cancer.From there the book makes a quick review of his childhood and circular academic path which passed through multiple degrees in English and literature before entering medical school and pursuing the neurological speciality. His experience with several of his patients, some of them terminal, is described. Then the narrative switches to his experience being the patient who has a terminal illness. The contrast of perspectives of being first the doctor and then later the patient is an interesting twist provided by this memoir.The author's wife provides an touching epilog that describes his death and an overall summary of the experience of battling cancer. One poignant feature of their story is the fact that they had an infant child who was purposely conceived after the initial diagnosis (but prior to chemotherapy). Death is part of all life including the lives of those who read this book. This book provides a reminder to appreciate the bit of life with which we are blessed."

I can't go on. I'll go on.
This was such a tragic but beautiful memoir. The author was 36 years old when he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. He was young, in his last year of residency as a neurosurgeon, a graduate of Stanford and Yale and incredibly talented with an undoubtedly bright future ahead of him. Upon his diagnosis, Paul Kalanthi was forced to ask himself what would make his life worth living in the face of imminent death. His answer was to throw himself into the passion of his work and his passion for neuroscience, philosophy, and literature truly radiates through these pages but in a completely interesting and relatable way. He spent time with his loved ones and ultimately achieved his dream of writing a book even though he died in the midst of writing this manuscript. Perhaps living a more fulfilled life than many who live into old age, Paul Kalanthi's book is a beautiful reminder to always pursue whatever it is you value because ultimately... we are all going to die.I appreciated the insight into the world of medicine and surgery. I've always been in awe of doctors and nurses who work in emergency rooms or ICUs and wondered how a human can see so much pain and trauma day after day and stay sane. As Paul describes, it's all too easy to numb yourself to it and learn to see patients as just another thing to cross off a to-do list rather than actual suffering human beings.It was impossible for me to not be reminded of my own father dying from cancer just two months ago and I was hesitant to read such a book so shortly after his death when the emotions are still so raw. This was a library book I put on hold months ago- before he died- and I felt like I had to read it before returning it since I waited so long to check it out and had seen the glowing reviews. The hardest parts to read were definitely the descriptions of how life-shattering cancer is and particularly Paul's wife's epilogue as she described the last moments with Paul. Cancer is a horrible way to watch a loved one die as it literally strips a person of everything... first your hair, and then your strength, and then your appetite, your weight, eventually your ability to breathe without an oxygen tank, and then your ability to breathe without tubes and wires and a hospital bed, your ability to pick up your own water bottle. I watched all this happen to my own father and in soooo many ways Paul's attitude up through his final days reminded me of my dad. My dad battled cancer for nine years. He received several terminal diagnoses over the years where we were told he had eight months or less to live and he still beat it several times. He was such an inspiration to everyone who knew him. While he was always realistic, my dad never gave up even through his final days. He was always accepting that death would come probably sooner rather than later, but would never succumb to the hopelessness and despair that even I found myself fighting off when it wasn't even me laying in the hospital bed. As I was reading this book I found myself asking what made my dad's life worth living in the face of that imminent death? How did he never succumb to that hopelessness in his nine years of being sick? One of the things I'll always remember about my dad was his unwavering sense of humor even during the most difficult times. In 2016, my dad suffered two strokes and a heart attack while undergoing chemotherapy treatments over the course of the year. As he lay in the ICU after his heart attack, the doctor the previous day had actually said to us that this was it, this would be what killed him, they couldn't do a bypass surgery in his weakened state and that chemo treatments would stop and hospice care would be the best option (my dad opted to continue chemo and not do hospice care... a fighter until his last day). Receiving that news I couldn't help but envision it as the beginning of the end, the despair threatening to slam into me, but my dad lay in that bed and joked to me about how awful the vanilla pudding was (he had lost his appetite and taste buds years ago). My dad went on to walk me down the aisle at my wedding two months later. He told me it was one of the happiest days of his life (the happiest being the day I was born) and kept frequently reminding me of it up until his very last day. Part of me finds comfort in the realization that I may have very well been the reason that made my dad's life worth living. (My dad was also a single father and just literally everything to me)Paul Kalanthi's message to his daughter:
When you come to one of the many moments in life when you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more, but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.
So this was a hard book for me to read, as it reminded me a lot of what my father had been through over the years. It was also a necessary book for me to read... since my dad died I've thought about how I waited until those last years to go visit him every weekend. How during those last years every photo of him became a precious treasure. Why was life not always like that? I always loved my dad but never felt this desperation to truly savor every moment with him until I was slapped in the face with a time stamp of his death. I try not to have regrets or tell myself what I ""should"" have done differently... but again, it's all a reminder to always savor every moment with those you love, to always pursue the things you love, because life is short and if you don't do it now when are you going to do it?"

So I’ll keep my review short. When Breath Becomes Air tells the tragic yet vivid account of the life of Dr. Paul Kalanithi, who was once a promising great neurosurgeon, then, a victim of cancer. This book is not just about a young man’s journey in battling cancer, though. This is a book that explores the meaning of life and death. I was moved beyond words and thought so much about my own life. How lucky I’m and how much there is still to chase. Yet the most important thing is to love the ones around you. Though there were some literary references and medical terms that I didn’t fully understand, they didn’t stop me from understanding and enjoying this book. Dr. Kalanithi wrote beautifully, and his experiences in the hospital—both as a doctor and as a patient—were as thrilling and unexpected as some well-crafted novels. I had mixed emotions when reading, but I was never bored. I believed When Breath Becomes Air is a book that you have to read at least once in a lifetime."

Se supărase, pentru că nu vorbeam cu ea despre asta. Se supărase, pentru că-i promisesem o viaţă, dar îi dăruisem altceva în schimb.”Chirurgia este o formulă matematică aflată în continuă schimbare. În fiecare an, apar noi variabile, împreună cu un sistem instabil de reguli, care trebuie dezvoltat treptat, atât pentru binele pacientului, cât şi pentru evoluţia medicinei. Este foarte uşor să spui că „vrei să salvezi vieţi” şi „să faci un bine”, dar când te pierzi pe lista cu „pros and cons”, conştient de viaţa pe care urmează să o accepţi, din momentul în care rosteşti jurământul lui Hippocrate, un alt sentiment îşi găseşte sălaş în sufletul tău. Un sentiment pe care un medic trebuie să înveţe să-l controleze sau să-l ascundă, în anumite momente: teamă.Visul meu de a deveni medic s-a evaporat în al doilea an de liceu, când mi-am dat seama că nu am „sânge rece”, iar o minte matematică nu avea să mă ajute atât de mult într-o sală de operaţii. Nu voiam să fiu o persoană care să împărtăşească veşti proaste, să se lupte cu boli incurabile sau să izbucnească în plâns pentru fiecare pacient pierdut. Nu aveam tăria de caracter sau dorinţa pe care am întrezărit-o la câţiva dintre colegii mei. Am făcut o alegere şi nu o regret. Pentru mine, trupul era un puzzle cu piese lipsă sau puse greşit, acele schimbări reprezentând simptomele unei boli. O viziune simplistă, de care mă agăţam când toceam manualele de biologie, până când m-am trezit la realitate, conştientă că trebuie să îmi găsesc alt drum, o altă chemare.Paul Kalanithi a oscilat întotdeauna între literatură şi medicină. Frumuseţea fără precedent a cuvintelor, conjunctura în care sensul lor este configurat de către fiecare autor în parte, pentru a le oferi o valenţă diferită, în funcţie de propria sa viziune, căutând răspunsuri sau dând naştere la noi întrebări, l-au fascinat pe Paul, care a iubit literatura. A devorat-o, a simţit-o şi a trăit-o. Dar el nu a avut o singură chemare.După ce am terminat cartea, am avut senzaţia că mă aflu la o răscruce de drumuri. Mi se uscaseră lacrimile şi eram furioasă. Furioasă pe viaţă, nu pe moarte. Nu aveam o ţintă pentru sentimentele mele şi nici nu aveam cu cine să vorbesc despre „Cu ultima suflare”, aşa că m-am izolat în bibliotecă şi am urmărit aproape toate videoclipurile cu Paul Kalanithi pe care le-am putut găsi. Credeam că îi cunosc „glasul”, după cuvintele aşternute pe hârtie, dar voiam să-l văd şi să-l aud. Nu a fost cea mai înţeleaptă decizie pe care am putut să o iau. De parcă autobiografia lui nu mă emoționase, să-l văd împreună cu soţia lui, să îl aud cum vorbeşte cu atâta dezinvoltură despre viaţă şi despre moarte, despre transformarea lui, din doctor în pacient..."

death
 has crossed our minds, and just as often, we tend to shrug it off, claiming that perhaps a more positive topic should take place in the conversation. Funnily enough, after emerging our own minds in such fear of what could possibly lead to our death (because let’s face it, we all are going to die eventually), or whether what will become of us after death, we tend to either ignore these unknown questions, or fill our heads with a lighter approach saying we will somehow end up alright in the end.Certainly, people are entitled to having their own resolutions, depending on their walks of life. What is fascinating here that perhaps we would like to know, is the journey which one takes on, before he lies down and perishes. 
When breath becomes air
is actually one of the very few books that is able to provide insights into this intriguing wonder of the human minds. Indeed, it is narrated by a neurosurgeon - Paul Kalanithi - who was also the very author of the book. Always having a knack for writing and reading philosophy, Paul has dedicated such devotion, and what was considered his dying days and months journaling in his diary his most genuine attitudes and reactions towards stage IV lung cancer - the disease which later on took his lives.As challenging as it had been to record his painful process of battling cancer, which sometimes did include his agony and feelings of hopelessness, Paul persisted in writing. One could say that the neurosurgeon considered it his ultimate mission to contribute to the aforementioned topic with his own story. Undeniably, what he left behind was authentic, real, and powerful.Perhaps, he has found a long-lasting meaning to strive for in his life.”I would have to learn to live in a different way, seeing death as an imposing itinerant visitor but knowing that even if I’m dying, until I actually die, I am still living.”"

This book is a beautifully written, philosophically sophisticated and scientifically informed document of his personal journey from the reasonable assumption of a brilliant future to the reality of a young and painful death. The book is an account of Kalanithi's earnest struggle for acceptance, meaning, love and purpose in the undeniable absence of time.If you're already feeling disinterested, hold up, please don't recoil, I promise you the book is utterly life-affirming. Personally speaking, it has functioned as an alarm bell, waking me up out of the trance I fall into on occasion. Sometimes I live under the protective shade of the palliative notion that what matters in life stays stable over time.But what is absolutely apparent in this work, is that in the absence of the privilege of a future, the things that matter change. The things that matter in the context of a hale and hearty life may seem trivial in the context of unrelenting brevity. Kalanithi unearths the profound insight that what matters is as relative and impermanent as everything else. The work of forging meaning and clarifying what it is that you honestly love, and what precisely you can live well without is never ending. As a reader, excepting that realization forces me to trade indolent comfort for a sense of urgency, presence and vitality. The final chapter is a message to his newborn daughter. The epilogue is written by his widow. Cherish life.."

It is interesting, philosophical, beautiful and heart-breaking. The descriptions of day-to-day realities of being a doctor were sometimes disturbing, really, but very interesting. There were a lot of profound thoughts about letting go and living with uncertainty, about one's calling, about accepting the new limitations of one's body.I can't count the amount of times I cried reading it. I generally avoid ""sad"" books, like, about war or cancer or slavery - things that I know are guaranteed to wreck me emotionally. But this book was so much more than that. It was excruciating, yes, but also liberating. Paul Kalanithi was a really interesting, unusual person, and he did have things to say.

I was honestly a little wary of reading it, knowing it wouldn't provide me an 'escape' which reading so wonderfully often does. It was going to feel very, very REAL.It did - feel real, that is. The book was written by a brilliant neurosurgeon (I don't use brilliant lightly - his education taking place at Stanford, Cambridge and Yale no less) whose brilliance is not limited to neuroscience. He is thoughtful, philosophical, and incredibly well read thanks to his love of literature and deep curiosity about life. He was torn about what to do with his career - write, or become a surgeon? His original plan was to go with medicine for the first half of his career, and write afterwards. But after he got the devastating diagnosis of lung cancer, he was forced to make whatever time he had left, count. The first part of the book was pre-diagnosis. I read this part with a constant lump in my throat. Hearing stories about his patients, how deeply he felt his responsibility to them, and his sensitivity, was lovely, especially knowing that the roles would soon be reversed for him.The second part of the book was how he responded to his diagnosis. He soldiered through finishing his residency, which was a super human feat considering he was going through treatment as well. However, what was most inspiring to me was how Paul Kalanithi faced his death, head on. An inevitability, but something we all face (maybe not in our 30's, but eventually). His lack of reproach and/or hysteria towards death was somehow comforting. His bravery and constant examination of life and death, his constant striving to eke out every last drop life had to offer him, were so inspiring. So, yes the book felt REAL (tears), but probably in the best way I could have hoped."

(My rating would be different if epilogue isn't there)Honestly speaking Paul was having very hard and tough circumstances but he had wrote all that courageously & effortlessly without giving a hint about the pain he's going through.Precisely he wrote this memoir in a general way. His career in Medicine, his days as a medical student than as a Neurosurgeon & than the lung cancer. The thing which click my heart is the epilogue, tears rolling down my cheeks and it's hard to breathe though reading  ""When breathe becomes Air"". I really want that her wife Lucy should write a book too what she felt when cancer was diagnosed, how she's going through all that and how she's living now.

I loved that he quoted Sir Thomas Browne in a very astute observation: ""With what strife and pains we come into the world we know not, but 'tis commonly no easy matter to get out of it."" So true.I gave a sob when I realized I'd reached his ending. The book doesn't prepare you for when that will be, which echoes the reality of death. I feel the loss of him. What a brilliant man who left the world. And how lucky he was to have found such a wonderful partner and to have gotten to know his daughter a bit.

At stake here are the very real decisions of one man dealing with his looming mortality as well as that of his his patients. Gripping tension and high stakes likely drive the popularity of this book, though I bet most readers couldn’t stomach even one more page. I know I couldn’t. The story is very painful.What an amazing person writing about his very difficult situation. Still, Mr. Kalanithi's book is not one that I'd highly recommend.

For me, the melancholy of finishing the last page came with the punch-in-the-gut realization that death has robbed the world of Paul’s incredible voice (and his talents as a neurosurgeon/neuroscientist). I could not believe how beautiful his prose was, how easy to read, how, even when he was suffering the effects of chemo, these were the pages he was able to produce. To say he was brilliant would be a massive understatement. I’m going to steal Ann Patchett’s words about Paul’s memoir because they are indeed so fitting: “Thanks to ‘When Breathe Becomes Air,’ those of us who never met Paul Kalanithi will both mourn his death and benefit from his life. This is one of a handful of books I consider to be a universal donor—I would recommend it to anyone, everyone.”I agree with Ann, which is why I’ll keep telling everyone I know about it until it ends up in their hands, too.A few of my favorite passages from “When Breathe Becomes Air” excerpted below: A beautiful sentiment of Paul’s: “You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.” Paul’s final words of the book to his daughter Cady (cue the waterworks): “When you come to one of the many moments in life when you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man’s days with a stead joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more, but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.” And my favorite passage in the gorgeous epilogue that Lucy, his wife, wrote Paul (because it speaks to all those tender moments that make a marriage the blessing it can be): “His diagnosis was like a nutcracker, getting us back to the soft, nourishing meat of our marriage …. [on their remaining time together] …. “We were as inseparable as we had been as medical students, when we would hold hands during lectures. Now we held hands in his coat pocket during walks outside after chemotherapy … He knew he would never be alone, never suffer unnecessarily. At home in bed a few weeks before he died, I asked him, “Can you breathe okay with my head on your chest like this?” His answer was “It’s the only way I know to breathe.” That Paul and I formed part of the deep meaning of each other’s lives is one of the greatest blessings that has ever come to me.”[And finally, as some of you may know, Paul’s wife, Lucy, is the twin sister of Joanna Goddard, founder of A Cup of Jo, my favorite blog on the web. While Joanna is never referenced in the book, the fact that I’ve been a long-time reader of hers and that she has written of Paul’s death (and this book) several times on her blog, served as a powerful reminder of how the Internet can make the world feel so small]"

Perhaps when the knowledge that death has a definable timeline makes the impact of this more powerful, as it is tangible, and not something that will happen “one day”. ”What are you most afraid of or sad about?”, she asked me one night as we were lying in bed. “Leaving you,” I told her.”With time being finite, Paul faces life changing decisions, which most of us take for granted, as we assume that we’ll greet another sunrise. With the cancer sapping his strength, Paul has to consider what path he wishes for his life to take, with the time he has left. What is important to him, what really matters at this crossroads.”No one asked about my plans, which was a relief, since I had none.””Who could, or should, I be?”It was exquisitely beautiful and utterly painful reading of the bond which Paul shared with his baby daughter, born a mere eight months before he passes away. ”Cady rubbed her eyes with chubby fists as her bedtime approached, and a family friend arrived to take her home. I held her cheek to Paul’s, tufts of their matching dark hair similarly askwew, his face serene, hers quizzical but calm, his beloved baby never suspecting that this moment was a farewell.”I thought that the epilogue written by Paul’s wife Lisa was written with much love and grace. She bares her soul about the impact which the diagnosis of Paul’s illness and then death had on his family, friends and colleagues. Paul was always searching for the “meaning of life”. He was a super smart guy, with a keen interest in literature and philosophy. He very much believed that the inner workings of the brain was what made a person who they were, and this all encompassing belief is what made him such an exceptional neurosurgeon. He treated his patients as a “whole being” rather than disassociating the illness from their being. ”For much of his life, Paul wondered about death – and whether he could face it with integrity. In the end, the answer was yes. I was his wife and a witness.”"

""When Breath Becomes Air"" was beautifully written, poignant, and offered tremendous insight regarding processing death in life. Paul Kalanithi was a brilliant man, and truly we have lost a wonderful human with his passing. His ability to convey his journey in life and hardship in becoming a Neurosurgeon was so powerful and thought provoking it kept pulling me back page by page. If you truly take the time to read his thoughts and feelings while accepting and battling cancer, it will undoubtedly leave you with far more than a lasting impression on familial and societal ethics of death, but also in as a treatise on what it means to live for others.On a side note, I thought the epilogue was very much worth the read. It was great to hear from his wife Lucy and her perspective. Their daughter Cadie will be blessed to have had such a wonderful man as a father, and Lucy did a heart breaking good job on describing their precious moments together before his passing.It may be early in the year, but this will remain a favorite read of mine for a long time to come."

Paul a găsit puterea de a scrie chiar și în momentele în care corpul îi ceda și cancerul îl învăluia în brațele sale puternice și neiertătoare. A reușit în mod excepțional să descopere echilibrul perfect între viață și moarte, bucurie și durere.

Kalanithi was an absolutely amazing and brilliant young man. Like my own father, his life ended much too young and at the prime of his life (very close to the same age.) His writing is beautiful and very thought provoking, reflecting his love of literature, scripture, and poetry as well as science. What I did feel the book lacked was passion. I would liked to have known more about him personally (his thoughts, emotions, and his relationships) not only of his career and being on the other side of medicine as a patient. But as his wife said in the epilogue, ""this is the book he wrote; his voice at the time....this is what he wrote when he needed to write it."" There is no doubt it is a moving memoir and definitely worth reading. I am in awe of all he accomplished after his diagnosis. He faced death with elegance and integrity."

In retrospect, it probably wasn’t the best idea to read it while travelling alone on a transatlantic flight, what with the well-known phenomenon that plane travel makes people emotional. My god I cried. I cried and sobbed and wept. At one point an air stewardess looked at me enquiringly, checking if I was OK. I wanted to grab her by her collar and yell ‘WHY? WHY MUST WE ALL DIE?’. I’m glad I didn’t. I imagine the TSA would take a dim view that kind of behaviour at 10,000 feet. So be warned: you will cry. A lot. But you should still read it. I recommend this to everyone.

As someone who watched her father painfully pass away from a brain tumor three years ago, almost to the month, this is not something I could have written such a beautiful book about. This is a perspective you'll not often have the chance to get - the doctor becoming the patient. I can't imagine having that kind of knowledge and knowing with certainty what your body is going to endure. But at the same time, with having this medical knowledge, it gave them time to garner courage for what was to come and put away false hopes of maybe being the exception to the rule.If you are sensitive to death, maybe hold off, but once you're in a better place, this truly is an enlightening read.

193,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66292681-sarah-lumos,Rating 5 out of 5," Re-read: 09/30/18  After I finished this book, I held it and cried. Not just teared up but cried in a way that made my heart ache. Dr. Kalanithi's thoughts, words, and journey touched me in a remarkable way. As his wife stated in the epilogue, while Dr. Kalanithi was unable to fulfil all his goals, he nonetheless left his mark on the world. He taught me, and others, what brings life meaning in the face of death. And also, what one focuses on when life becomes a perpetual present and materialistic goals like wealth or status fade. In my opinion, there are books. And then there are BOOKS. This is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read. A genuine masterpiece. It will stick with me forever, and I know I will return to it again and again.  Previous Review It is 3 in the morning and I just put this book down.  I write this review through a filter of tears and a gnawing ethereal zeal building in my heart.  When I first ordered this book, I was struck by the size. It was small, both length and size wise, but I shoved my feelings aside. Ignoring my thoughts and labeling them as judgmental ( ""a renowned book does not have to be 300+ pages!"" ) and yet, as I finished this book, I realized why it was short – it stopped when it should have kept going. I knew reading this book would be an emotional journey, and one I would learn numerous things from. In  “When Breath Becomes Air” , Dr. Paul Kalanithi chronicles his descent into illness. His book is divided into two parts: before and after his lung cancer diagnosis. Being only in his mid-30s, Dr. Kalanithi was forced to face uncomfortable truths many are fortunate to have lifetimes to contemplate. He chronicles his extraordinary academic career, and the events that sparked his love for literature, philosophy, and neuroscience. And also, the illness that would change the life he had planned forever.  Imagine being at the top of the mountain only to have it collapse. This book forces us to face our own undeniable truth - we all must die.  Dr. Paul Kalanithi wrote this book as a way to bestow upon his daughter, as well as the readers, the feelings he grappled with during his last moments, in the hopes that it would help others work through their own grief and prognosis. Throughout my life, I took on the role of patient, but this book gave me an insight into what it was like to be the doctor, and also transition from that role into the patient. This book gave me an opportunity to witness the dedication and gruelling hours neurosurgeons often spend in hospitals. The brain is a complicated organ, and neurosurgeons not only require a high-degree of knowledge, but also technical and ethical skills. I am paraphrasing this, but he said in the book, if neurosurgery were just a job, it would be an awful one. I felt a bit intimidated by the medical terminology in this book. It has been awhile since my last biology class, but the author intended this book to be for everyone and as I read, the terms sort of dissolved into the background. I sought the bigger picture, which was the way Dr. Kalanithi confronted his illness. Even in his final moments, he strived to help his patients, and now continues to help others through this book. The epilogue written by his wife, Dr. Lucy Kalanithi, is also unbearably stunning. As I placed myself in her shoes, I could not help but cry. What I take away most from this book is that death is inevitable, grief is powerful, but life is magical and beautiful.  As his wife states in the book, “What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy.”  Dr. Kalanithi is perhaps one of the best writers I have ever known. The writing in this book is alluring; it draws you in and captivates your spirits. The prose sings. I kept turning the pages and time dissipated into the background. What stood out to me most was his resilience during a pivotal moment of turmoil. From intense work hours to the compilation of this book, Dr. Kalanithi never stopped persevering.  All I can say is that I was moved by his unflinching honesty.  It was a true joy to learn about this man’s life and the many contributions he made, and continues to make through his words. I think that is the magic of books. People pass away, but their ideas and spirit continue to resonate with us. Despite never having met Dr. Kalanithi, I felt a personal affiliation with his journey. It inspired me and made me question fundamental truths about time, illness, and death."

But above all, see what is to still live, to profoundly influence the lives of others after you are gone, by your words.""""Death comes for all of us. For us, for our patients: it is our fate as living, breathing, metabolizing organisms. Most lives are lived with passivity toward death_it's something that happens to you and those around you.""After finishing this profound, emotional memoir I feel like I lost a good friend. A great memoir. A gasping, desperate, powerful little book, bigger on the inside than outside. As he was living out the end of his life, he wrote this brief powerful memoir. Paul Kalanithi: son, husband, father, brilliant surgeon. He was a healer whose very existence gave hope to so many. When Breath Becomes Air should not be taken as a maudlin reading, but one of hope and one of living a life well, no matter what the promise of longevity reveals. ""Medical school sharpened my understanding of the relationship between meaning, life, & death.""""I had started in this career, in part, to pursue death: to grasp it, uncloak it, & see it eye-to-eye, unblinking.""He wrote his memoir during his last year of life. In his most desperate time. And it is still amazing.“I began to realize that coming in such close contact with my own mortality had changed both nothing and everything. Before my cancer was diagnosed, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. After the diagnosis, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. But now I knew it acutely. The problem wasn’t really a scientific one. The fact of death is unsettling. Yet there is no other way to live.”“The tricky part of illness is that, as you go through it, your values are constantly changing. You try to figure out what matters to you, and then you keep figuring it out. It felt like someone had taken away my credit card and I was having to learn how to budget. You may decide you want to spend your time working as a neurosurgeon, but two months later, you may feel differently. Two months after that, you may want to learn to play the saxophone or devote yourself to the church. Death may be a one-time event, but living with terminal illness is a process.” “The word hope first appeared in English about a thousand years ago, denoting some combination of confidence and desire. But what I desired—life—was not what I was confident about—death. When I talked about hope, then, did I really mean “Leave some room for unfounded desire?” No. Medical statistics not only describe numbers such as mean survival, they measure our confidence in our numbers, with tools like confidence levels, confidence intervals, and confidence bounds. So did I mean “Leave some room for a statistically improbable but still plausible outcome—a survival just above the measured 95 percent confidence interval?” Is that what hope was? Could we divide the curve into existential sections, from “defeated” to “pessimistic” to “realistic” to “hopeful” to “delusional”? Weren’t the numbers just the numbers? Had we all just given in to the “hope” that every patient was above average? It occurred to me that my relationship with statistics changed as soon as I became one.” “The physician’s duty is not to stave off death or return patients to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face, and make sense of, their own existence.”“At moments, the weight of it all became palpable. It was in the air, the stress and misery. Normally, you breathed it in, without noticing it. But some days, like a humid muggy day, it had a suffocating weight of its own. Some days, this is how it felt when I was in the hospital: trapped in an endless jungle summer, wet with sweat, the rain of tears of the families of the dying pouring down.”
 “The main message of Jesus, I believed, is that mercy trumps justice every time.” 

YOU left me, sweet, two legacies,—A legacy of loveA Heavenly Father would content,Had He the offer of; You left me boundaries of pain Capacious as the sea,Between eternity and time,Your consciousness and me.

This might have hit that little bit harder given that Paul's job as a neurosurgeon intertwines somewhat with my own. We had shared interests too, with a love for literature. However Paul had a wonderful way with words, managing to capture so many emotions and thoughts and make them come alive. This isn't a long memoir, more a short look at those last months with Paul and his family as well as a bit of backstory. However the impact will stay with me for some time.

WHEN BREATH BECOMES AIR one of the most beautiful, extraordinary and poignant of memoirs -foreward Abraham Verghese. Paul Kalanithi, a wise and gifted storyteller; a remarkable man, physician, surgeon, husband, son, and father. His childhood, desires, loves, hopes, ambitions, career, adulthood, marriage, and lastly- his ultimate joy and short-lived status, of fatherhood. He writes from his heart---from a physician's viewpoint, as well as a patient. Awe-in·spir·ing! Living, death, fears, mortality, and grief.  How will you embrace the end? Will you leave a legacy behind, or influence the lives of others after you are gone? Paul does so. He writes about time, what it means to him, in the context of his illness. A powerful message. An insightful gift-- he has given unselfishly to others. Paul’s desire was to write this book.  He had a lifelong love of writing and reading. He became a physician instead; yet, always dreamed of coming back to literature, in some form. When he realized this, unfortunately, he had so little time. His end desire was to see the book published. Indeed, this work-of-art, reflects his passion, through each and every word, from beginning to end. Breathtaking. Medical school and neurosurgery. Paul spent time studying literature at Stanford and the history of medicine at Cambridge, in an attempt to better understand the particularities of death, only to come away feeling like they were still unknowable to him. The mysteries, experiential, and biological manifestations.He had a love and empathy for those who suffered, for what they endured and what he personally would soon come to bear. At age thirty-six his life takes an unexpected turn. “You that seek what life is in death, now find it air that once was breath. New names unknown, old names were gone: Till time end bodies, but souls none. Reader! Then make time, while you be, but steps to your eternity. – Baron Brooke Fulke Greville, “Caelica 83” Paul’s diagnosis of lung cancer  hit hard, however as a brilliant neurosurgeon, he knew well what lay ahead. Although Paul accepted his limited life expectancy, the neurologic decline was a new devastation, the prospect of losing meaning was agonizing.  “A man who relied on his own strength and support of others. He faced each stage of his illness with grace. Not with bravado, or a misguided faith that he would overcome or beat cancer, but with an authenticity that allowed him to grieve the loss of the future he had planned and forge a new one.” Paul’s voice in WHEN BREATH BECOMES AIR  is strong, distinctive, and full of hope— not for an unlikely cure, but for days that were full of purpose and meaning. His death and his daughter's birth. Writing this book was his chance, to teach us to face death with integrity. Paul delivers a strong  and bold message for all of us--our fate is to die—whether young or old. We are a ""death-avoidant"" culture. We cannot deny this fact when it is staring us in the face. Some may not get any warning. The fact that we do not talk about death, does not mean that we do not think about it. Many of us are now baby boomers,  we are facing our elderly parents' care, and concerns about our own health –the subject of death become more apparent. We can face it a number of ways. We do not have to be ninety, to begin thinking about it. It can occur at any age, as reflected herein. Through support from his wife, Lucy (an internist), his loving family, faith, and friends----with bounds of courage, they chose to have a baby, and less than a year later he would be gone. There would be difficult choices to make. Chemo, clinical trials, treatments, and end of life decisions. They never knew Paul’s deathbed would be so near. Only twenty-two months ago they received the devastating diagnosis, and only eight months earlier, the joyous birth of their daughter.When Breath Becomes Air  was unfinished, derailed by Paul’s rapid decline; however, he wrote relentlessly, fueled by purpose, motivated by the ticking clock. Despite the unwavering mental focus, sickness, and fatigue, the final book deal came three months before his death. An urgency—a race against time.“Paul confronted death—examined it, wrestled with it, accepted it—as a physician and a patient. He wanted to help people understand death and face their mortality. Dying is one’s fourth decade is unusual now, but dying is not. ""  His desire - to get the reader into his shoes. ""Not the sensationalism of dying; however, here’s what lies up ahead on the road.” He did more than just describe the terrain. He traversed it bravely. The joy and sorrow. The journey. Paul’s strength was defined by ambition and effort, but also by softness, the opposite of bitterness. He spent much of his life wrestling with the question of how to live a meaningful life, and his book explores that essential territory. Readers learn of Paul’s  childhood, and his mom’s love of literature, his dad’s strength as a cardiologist and his dedication to his patients, community, and family. His lovely, wife Lucy, their marriage struggles, and deep love. His love of reading, books, and literature. All of the subjects are part of their truth, struggles, and redemption – the meaning of Paul’s life and Lucy’s.They weathered the storm of Paul’s illness and drew strength from one another, family and their own daughter--as his wife Lucy writes the touching and moving Epilogue. Breathtaking! Profound—""a daily act of holding life and death, joy and pain in balance, while exploring new depths of gratitude and love"". Paul’s writing is utterly stunning —lyrical, poetic, spellbinding. The prose is magical – unforgettable. The title is very fitting, serving as a metaphor for the end, we all must face. Kalanithi reminds us that inevitably the breath of life fades, and we merge with the earth and atmosphere. With humor, wit, love, honesty, and raw emotion -- his love for life, faith, family, and literature shines through. A powerful tale of living with death. Paul tells his story so eloquently-- his contributions as both a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist and his legacy--- his book, his story. A way to help others, a contribution, only he personally, could tell. He chose to look death in the eye.“You left me, sweet, two legacies—A legacy of love. A Heavenly Father would content, had He the offer of; You left me boundaries of pain. Capacious as the sea, Between eternity and time, Your consciousness and me.”— Emily Dickinson Highly recommend  print, digital and audio. The audiobook is outstanding narrated by Sunil Malhotra (Paul), Cassandra Campbell (Lucy). Cassandra Campbell’s  voice is almost angelic- a perfect match for Lucy- Spellbinding. It will capture your heart, mind, and soul—you will find yourself hitting rewind numerous times! Top Non-Fiction Book of 2016. A Must Read! On a personal note:  I have put off writing this review, as there seem to be no words to adequately describe the impact and magnitude of this stunning memoir. There are so many beautiful quotes. I pre-ordered the audiobook, prior to receiving approval for the advanced reading digital copy. I was so captured by the lyrical writing, I listened to the audiobook twice, read the book, bookmarking so many passages, and continue to reference. I have told everyone about this remarkable book, and have watched the videos surrounding the life of this extraordinary couple, and am still utterly speechless. Astounded by their courage and the way they faced death. They lived every moment to the end. Fully alive, despite his physical collapse---this was the life he was given, and this is what he made of it. I can only hope I can be half as courageous when my time comes, as well as my family members.  As many of my Goodreads’ book friends are aware, my mom (83) has stage IV colon cancer (for the last two years) and my dad, (84) has leukemia. I read many books surrounding this disease (both fiction and non-fiction), as well as medical, inspirational and spiritual. This is one of the most inspiring memoirs I have ever read! It has a calming peaceful tone, dissolving fears—beauty and comfort remain with you, long after the book ends. This is not a ""one-time read"". It is thought-provoking. A treasure. A guide. A gift. Kalanithi's love lives on through his brave words.A special thank you to Random House and NetGalley for granting my wish--an ARC of a remarkable gift in exchange for an honest review.

Và quả thật đúng như thế, sau khi nghiền xong Khi Hơi Thở Hóa Thinh Không, mắt tớ cứ rơm rớm mẹ tưởng khóc vì thất tình.Khi Hơi Thở Hóa Thinh Không là tự truyện của bác sĩ chuyên ngành phẫu thuật thần kinh người Mỹ gốc Ấn - Paul Kalanithi - và được chia làm hai phần: Trước khi anh phát hiện ra căn bệnh nan y của mình và Quá trình anh thích ứng với căn bệnh ung thư hiểm nghèo ấy. Trong cuốn sách, Paul đã quay về quá khứ, ôn lại kỷ niệm khi anh còn là một đứa trẻ yêu thích thơ văn và rồi sự yêu thích ấy dần thay thế cho những trăn trở, suy tư của anh về bộ não con người: Làm sao mà bộ não lại có thể tác động đến cảm xúc, suy nghĩ, tình cảm, hành động, vv... của một sinh vật sống như thế. Để rồi chàng sinh viên yêu ngôn từ với tấm bằng Thạc sỹ văn học và Cử nhân sinh học đã quyết định chọn khoa Ngoại thần kinh làm đích đến cuối cùng của mình. Phần I được anh giải thích và tái hiện lại thời gian Paul là bác sĩ khoa nội trú, những thử thách ám ảnh và những giằng kéo trong thâm tâm của người bác sĩ, những hoang mang và cả những kinh hoàng mà Paul phải thích ứng và vượt qua. Mà cũng qua đó, người đọc cũng phần nào thấu hiểu những khó khăn và vất vả rất riêng của nghề y, và đôi khi cái chết chính là phương án thích hợp nhất để chấm dứt mọi khổ đau.Bản thân t�� thừa nhận trong khi đọc cuốn sách này có rất nhiều chỗ không hiểu, những khái niệm sinh học hóa học, những phương pháp trị liệu hay cả những thuật ngữ ngành Y quả thật cực kỳ khó để thẩm thấu. Nhưng lý do để tớ rate Khi Hơi Thở Hóa Thinh Không số điểm tuyệt đối có lẽ là vì ngưỡng mộ đạo đức, lương tâm của một người làm nghề Y như anh, về những gì mà Paul đã cống hiến và sự hết mình của anh, coi nghề y chính là mục đích cao cả và là sứ mệnh thiêng liêng; ngưỡng mộ Paul bởi bên cạnh việc làm bác sỹ, anh cũng là một người chồng có trách nhiệm lo lắng cho tổ ấm của mình, anh hiểu được những trọng trách khi là người đàn ông trong gia đình trên đôi vai anh; và sau đó là vì khâm phục sức mạnh ý chí và tinh thần của Paul - một vị bác sỹ đã đối mặt với căn bệnh ung thư phổi một cách kiên cường và quả cảm - tất cả những điều này đã làm tớ thực sự ngưỡng mộ và cảm động.Căn bệnh ung thư phổi đã biến Paul từ một bác sỹ trở thành bệnh nhân. Bác sỹ suy cho cùng cũng chỉ là một con người bình thường, Paul có tuyệt vọng, có chán nản, có đau khổ, có gục ngã nhưng anh đã lại đứng lên, khôi phục tinh thần và ý chí để rồi chiến đấu với căn bệnh hiểm nghèo của mình bên cạnh sự giúp đỡ của người vợ, của cha mẹ và những người thân, và cả những vị bác sỹ cũng là người bạn cùng sát cánh bên anh suốt quãng thời gian khó khăn ấy. Giây phút Paul ôm trọn cô con gái bé bỏng, cố gắng tận hưởng và lưu giữ tất cả những khoảnh khắc, biến nỗi đau trở thành tình yêu thương đẹp đẽ, thiêng liêng và chân thành nhất cho cô con gái mà anh sẽ không có mặt để chứng kiến những năm tháng trưởng thành đã làm tớ rơi nước mắt trước tấm lòng của một người cha. Và tớ đã khóc khi tới phần Lời bạt được viết bởi vợ anh - Lucy Kalanithi - đã tái hiện lại những xót xa trong năm tháng cuối đời của người bác sỹ trẻ tuổi khi anh đã không còn đủ sức chống chọi lai với căn bệnh. Paul đã sẵn sàng để ra đi, để bác sỹ rút ống thở và dành thời gian ngắn ngủi cuối cùng của mình trong vòng tay yêu thương của gia đình. Paul Kalanithi đã chiến đấu một cách bền bỉ và hết mình như vậy, đã cống hiến tất cả những gì tốt nhất của anh cho nghề y, đã chiến đấu một cách kiên cường với căn bệnh ung thư, đã dành những yêu thương nhất của mình mặc dù ngắn ngủi cho vợ con và đã để lại dấu ấn riêng của anh trong cuộc đời này dẫu anh đã đi mãi về cõi vĩnh hằng.
Paul luôn băn khoăn về cái chết - và liệu anh có thể đối mặt với nó một cách trọn vẹn tâm hình mình hay không. Kết thúc, câu trả lời là ""Có"".
Khi Hơi Thở Hóa Thinh Không với một hình ảnh Paul Kalanithi - 
""mong manh nhưng không bao giờ yếu đuối""
 - như vợ anh đã viết.Khi Hơi Thở Hoá Thinh Không hoàn toàn xứng đáng số điểm tuyệt đối, và chắc chắn là một cuốn sách mà tớ sẽ giở đi giở lại nhiều lần. Highly recommend! (Cơ mà giá bìa thì mắc quá đi mất.)"

I sobbed for the last large portion of this book. Honestly, this is a book that will stick with me. I have no words. How do I describe a book like this?I've been eyeing this book off for months know and I finally decided to pick up an ebook of this because I really needed a book to punch me in the feels right about now. It definitely delivered. Basically, it's an autobiography about Paul's life. He was so close to becoming a renowned neurosurgeon when he got diagnosed with lung cancer which obviously put a halt to a lot of stuff he had planned. He always wanted to be a writer, so when he realised how close to death he really was, he decided to tell his story. I still have no words for this book. It's something you need to experience for yourself and I'd definitely recommend picking it up if you want a real, raw take on mortality."

But even more valuable was that Dr. Kalanithi was a man of great compassion and understanding, striving to be moral in his decisions. In his surgeries he dealt with the most delicate of all human organs, the brain. The slightest misstep could incapacite a patient. He strove for perfection, yet recognized true perfection is unattainable. Even for Dr. Kalanithi, the pressure and stress of the job was heavy in his heart as in this quote: ""At moments the weight of it all became palpable. It was in the air, the stress and misery. Normally, you breathed it in, without noticing it. But some days, like a humid muggy day, it had a suffocating weight of its own. Some days, this is how it felt when I was in the hospital, trapped in an endless jungle summer, wet with sweat, the rain of tears of the families of the dying pouring down.""When Dr. Kalanithi was diagnosed with lung cancer, his world was turned upside down. Now he himself was the patient, but could also act in the role of a doctor, analyzing his treatments. He questioned the purpose and meaning of his life. What was to be his legacy? Supported by family, especially his wife Lucy, Dr. Kalanithi had to redefine his life, choosing to write this book to give his daughter, Cody, a glimpse of the man he was. His message to her is defined in this quote: ""When you come to one of the many moments in life when you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man's days with sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, this is an enormous thing.""May others be inspired by the wisdom to be found in this book."

I'll write a real review when I get my emotions in check lol 😭----I don't know if my emotions will ever be in check again, but here goes this review:Dr. Paul Kalanithi is a young aspiring neurosurgeon in his residency when he gets the devastating news that he has terminal lung cancer. What is so venerable about Paul is how he cared so deeply for his patients and how important the doctor/patient relationship is, especially for those whose lives are hanging in the balance. However, for someone who is exposed to the workings of the human brain as well as the suffering and death of others on a daily basis, Paul realizes that he actually doesn’t really understand what they are going through until tragedy happens to him. To watch the doctor go from aid to aided as he is slowly engulfed by his illness was absolutely poignant. This autobiography made me reflect on my own life as well as from where and whom I derive meaning. The thought of death is terrifying, and the fact that it is inevitable makes it more so. But, I think the thought of not having lived a purposeful, meaningful life rooted in love before you meet that fate is even scarier. At the end of the day, the way in which Paul accepted his fate so readily and fearlessly was very admirable. As Paul passed away before the publication of this book, his wife wrote an Epilogue which ended up being such a moving finish. Although he is no longer with us, it is beautiful that he gets to live on through this memoir. 
“I don’t believe in the wisdom of children, nor in the wisdom of the old. There is a moment, a cusp, when the sum of gathered experience is worn down by the details of the living. We are never so wise as when we live in the moment.”

We try everything to push that end somewhere far far away. But actually, we have minimal influence as human beings, on the ways our body is working and responds. Sport, eatinf healthy, smoking, not smoking, alcohol etc...we are not able to visualise our bodies/tissues/cells to know exactly what is happening there. We know what studies, statistics, reviews, researchers tell us. Still we dont really know our body. We dont see metabolism actually happen, we know about it. The only thing we've got is hope and humbleness in front of this great universe where we are small small little dots.Anyways, being an intensive care doctor who deals with death almost on a daily basis, i was very keen to reading this book. How does it feel when it actually strikes you? How does it feel to be a patient?The only sad thing at this book is the epilogue, so Lucy's POV. i think the actual illness is worse to bear for our loved ones, than for ourselves. One learns to cope, because it is happening TO him. the ones around us see the dreams go to dust, see the loss of strength, see the deterioration of the body, see the everyday torture. And it is horrible for them. This book was about cancer. but let me tell you, there are sooooo many horrible diseases to die from. There are for example genetic diseases like Huntington, which strikes somewhere when you are 40 and even if you do genetic testing and know about, you cannot do anything about it. There is ALS, there is heart failure. All we have is hope not to get all of those, try to keep our immune system happy, and if we get them, try to live and die with dignity. as Paul K did."
212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9750143-bookofcinz,Rating 5 out of 5,"I sometimes tend to judge a book by its title, ‘When Breath Becomes Air” lived up to its breathtakingly beautiful title. Reading this book was like breathing, I felt so many emotions for Paul. It was as if I went through the seven stages of grief with him. The writing itself was like art, I could not get over how well put together the book was and Paul’s use of words. I also could not help but wonder, how a dying man could write something this amazing and what the book would have been like if he was actually healthy. He has such a strong literary voice, he would have been a great addition to the literary community. I am a little sad that Paul’s memoir ended untimely, I would have liked to read more about him and his life. It is clear Paul had a lot to say and it is indeed sad that we will not benefit future from such a brilliant mind. For this reason it is a sad book, not because of he was dying, but because the world will no longer have access to the mind of Paul. The epilogue from his wife was enough to send me weeping. I am always interested to hear a story from a third person and Lucy did an amazing job of bringing Paul’s story to a beautiful end. I loved that she gave an entirely different side to Paul story. She picked up the few slack that Paul left and I loved that she really showed how human Paul was throughout his life. I read this line and I could almost weep because of how beautiful it was: “At home in bed a few weeks before he died, I asked him, “Can you breathe okay with my head on your chest like this?” His answer was “It’s the only way I know how to breathe.”An amazing must read.  "
213,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18911104-will,Rating 3 out of 5,"I'm still making my mind up on this one. Kalanithi is an incredibly compelling writer and his words stay with the reader. But, to be honest, I didn't found much new here. Kalanithi was no doubt an impressive elite neurosurgeon, but I have to admit that his self-praise (I wouldn't go so far as to call it narcissism) started to bother me. My close friend hoping to pursue an MD/PhD told me this is typical of medical ""royalty,"" the gifted doctors who go after glory and shining success. Attending a hyper-competitive college famous for grooming medical royalty as a sociology student has, for me, definitely soured the overwhelmingly positive image of medicine.I think that the near-universally positive analyses of When Breath Becomes Air lack a real critical lens. This work is definitely inspiring because of Kalanithi's persuasive power, his admirable moral compass and dedication to medicine, his inexhaustible work ethic, and his tragic, yet beautiful death. But at the risk of sounding insensitive, I couldn't help but feel that this memoir is so lauded because the author died tragically so early and because his narrative fits neatly into the American tendency of creating popular hagiographies of the elite's elite.I think the epilogue written by the author's wife Lucy on Kalanithi's death is the best and most moving part of the book, and I don't know how that should factor into a measured approach to assessing the whole work. Any thoughts? I'd be happy to be proven wrong.Update: Over the last month, I came to the realization that When Breath Becomes Air is one of my least favorite memoirs (even though it definitely has merit). So three stars it is."
214,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3106785-beth-bonini,Rating 5 out of 5,"I know, from sharing my review of this book with the Bookstagram community, that many readers are put off by knowing how this story ends: Paul Kalanthi - husband, young father, neurosurgeon - dies at the age of 37. He should have been enjoying the summit of his life, rather than chronicling its agonisingly swift decline. Few of us are philosophical enough to interpret Kalanthi's death as anything other than a cruel tragedy, and yet that is really not the story that Kalanthi chooses to tell. Instead, he shares his search for meaning - and how it lead him from literature, his first and enduring love - to the career path of medicine. He also tries to explain what it is like to be a neurosurgeon, making complex decisions about the quality of life - and death. Finally, his wife Lucy Kalanthi describes her husband's final days, and frames her husband's death within the context of his family's loving embrace. This book is sad, yes, but not unbearably so. I did cry when I read his tribute to his baby daughter, but mostly because it was beautiful, and not just because it was so poignant. I felt like it was a privilege to read such a deeply felt memoir, and a reminder that life is not something to be taken for granted."
215,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Absolutely wonderful book. Right as Paul Kalanithi is about to finish his training as a neurosurgeon and neuroscientist, he is diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer. As a surgeon, he knows that he most likely has only a short amount of time remaining to him. As a doctor, he's always been on the other side of the equation. As someone who has extensively studied life and death and philosophy, and with advanced degrees in English, he always planned to write later in his career. This book was written during the course of his illness and published after his death. His attempts to find understanding, his willingness to document his private thoughts and to be open about the physical and emotional issues, and his courage in using his physical resources to return to practicing medicine as long as he can—make this book absolutely compelling. It's beautifully written and almost magical."

223,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28831526-jean,Rating 5 out of 5,"I cried when I read Paul Kalanithi’s autobiography, When Breath Becomes Air. Three times. The first time was when I read the prologue. I thought I was in for a real tearjerker. What I discovered in these pages, however, was the extraordinary life of a man who dared to question his existence and live it with his whole heart, mind, body, and soul.Paul Kalanithi did not set out to become a neurosurgeon. As a lover of literature who was on a quest for understanding of the human mind, like the poet Whitman, to get to the meaning of “the Physiological-Spiritual Man.” The more he studied literature, the more he came to realize that it wasn’t enough. He added biology and science courses to his repertoire. This ultimately led him to medicine, specifically, to neurosurgery. This is a grueling course that requires years of long, tough residency. Tougher still is Stage IV lung cancer. Paul Kalanithi never asked, “Why me?” That’s not to say he did not cry or grieve the loss of his health, his career, and quite likely, his life with his family. Rather, he forged onward, living each day the best he could.In the days and months before the diagnosis, we are treated to some of his experiences as a resident and some of the lessons he learned. At times, he seemed to smile at the early days of his training, such as his first day of obstetrics rotation. But he quickly learned that medicine is about life and death, “any neurosurgical problem forces a patient and family, ideally with a doctor as a guide, to answer this question: What makes life meaningful enough to go on living.” He wrote of learning to treat all his paperwork as patients, not the other way around. Paul Kalanithi comes across as a man who was empathetic, one who cherished each of his patients’ lives as sacred. One of his biggest lessons, it seems, was this: “the physician’s duty is not to stave off death or return patients to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face, and make sense of, their own existence.""Paul had that kind of support in his own life. His wife was a doctor also, and she was a strong supporter of his career and during his illness. His oncologist struck me as a very competent clinician and a very caring, encouraging person who cared about his overall wellbeing. When Paul’s cancer returned after a brief remission, he turned to writing this book, something he had long wanted to do. He wrote honestly and eloquently of his struggles, not only in his profession and with his illness, but also in his marriage. It is obvious, however, that Paul and Lucy had a very strong bond; it comes through in his writing and in Lucy’s epilogue. The second time that I cried was a moment that touched me deeply, for it was both joyful and foreboding. The final time, it pretty much goes without saying, comes as Paul’s narrative ends and Lucy’s begins.Perhaps the most touching quote was this one, recalled by Lucy, “At home in bed a few weeks before he died, I asked him, ‘Can you breathe okay with my head on your chest like this?’ His answer was ‘It’s the only way I know how to breathe.’ That Paul and I formed part of the deep meaning of each other’s lives is one of the greatest blessings that has ever come to me.”Paul Kalanithi finished his residency but never did take his boards to practice as a medical doctor. He was just 36 when he died on March 9, 2015. Among the family he leaves behind are his wife Lucy and daughter Elizabeth Acadia “Cady”. Like this book, When Breath Becomes Air, his beloved daughter Cady is also his legacy.5 stars"

I think the reason I finally picked up this book is that these days I often remembered the sadness I saw in her eyes for her father.This is indeed a difficult book. Paul had been a neurosurgeon. He completed his B.A. in Human biology & M.A. in English literature from Stanford. He worked on Walt Whitman as his M.A. thesis topic. At this time he realized philosophy had a very abstract way to deal with the questions of human life, its meaning & death. He demanded a more direct confrontation, more direct approach. As he belonged from a family of doctors, he felt medical science could answer his questions. He decided to go through the thorough & detailed preparation for admission in medical school. In the meantime he complete M.Phil. in History and Philosophy of Science and Medicine from Cambridge. He graduated from Yale school of medicine in 2007 and received Lewis H. Nahum Prize for his outstanding research. I looked for some of his papers on google scholar. While many of his classmates chose various less stressed high salaried paths considering the stress of medical life & the want for a quality life style. He decided to go for neuroscience - one of the occupations where stress & tensions are like hell. He joined Stanford for his residency training in neuroscience & completing his post doctoral fellowship in neuroscience. During this period he authored over twenty scientific publications and received the American Academy of Neurological Surgery’s highest award for research. He reached the culmination of his ambition & career. Lots of high salaried job offers were waiting for him.At this moment terminal stage of lung cancer came as a bolt from the blue. This is not a biography/memoir to feel sorry/sympathy for such an enormously gifted/ brilliant person. Because Paul himself proved brave in the face of this terminal disease. The disease is one of a life shattering. He took the courage to move back to his OR, strenuous responsibilities of a neurosurgeon, though for momentarily. He shared his feelings & thoughts about mortality in the face of his own death. It's just a gentle reminder of how we are just a speck of dust in the vastness of this whole universe.Paul lived both the life of a patient & a doctor. A few days ago he was the actor who acted upon disease/ patients. Now he became the one who was being acted upon. And for his love of literature, he left back his memoir for us. Though it's incomplete in terms of the final events in his own words, it's complete with the meaning and worth of his life.While reading Harari's ""Homo Deus"" the line that ""Death is just a technological fault"" got stuck in my mid. Whenever somebody, in any of my M.Sc. classes any of my teachers mentioned "" death is inevitable"" - I would feel resistant remembering Harari's statement. Now it seems like Harari just exaggerated. His statement seems like so overrated & full of fantasy. Just something good to ear.As a neurosurgeon while Paul learnt to judge whose lives could be saved, whose couldn’t be, and whose shouldn’t be, in his last periods, he decided to withdraw from his own. Because just to keep breathing with some available treatment or means or machine doesn't necessarily mean to live a quality life worth the meaning. The price of keeping this breath going is huge. As Paul put in the earlier parts of his memoir "" How much neurologic suffering would you let your child endure before saying that death is preferable? ""After a long time I felt compelled to read something at a stretch. This autobiographical memoir will definitely be very close to my heart."

227,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5788507-melodie,Rating 5 out of 5," I finished this memoir almost twenty four hours ago and I am still digesting and struggling to put my thoughts into words. Paul Kalanithi had many things to his credit. He was a compassionate gifted physician and surgeon, a lover of the written word and a seeker of greater meaning to life's greatest mystery.... death.  When he received a diagnosis of lung cancer, his ambitions, hopes and dreams took a hit. He started writing his truth with love and candor. At the age of thirty six, his life ended too soon after fighting lung cancer. Some might say he lost his battle against cancer, I would say he achieved his understanding of life's journey to death. I'm hoping with this memoir, we can speak more freely and embrace more fully life's inevitable transition to death which comes for us all. And most importantly, appreciate each day we are given. "
228,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39346323-greg,Rating 3 out of 5,"Five stars to Paul Kalanithi, and one star for all of the filler material. Let me explain. The Foreward, by Abraham Verghese, is full of passages like: ""Paul, it occurred to me, was [Thomas ] redux. Or given that forward time is our illusion, perhaps it's that Browne was Kalanithi redux. Yes, it's headspinning stuff."" Ah, I'm pretty sure most of us have encountered the theory that time may not necessarily be linear, so why be patronizing? We are not stupid, Mr. Verghese. Okay, once you stumble through this unnecessary prologue/filler, you get to the author's introduction. The author is ill and he goes to visits friends. He is so sick he can't even pick up his luggage to fly home, so his dear, life-long friend offers to mail his luggage to him. If my dear, life-long friend is too sick to take his luggage home with him, I'd be damn sure to accompany my friend home and get him home comfortably or take him to a hospital. Anyway, so now we've read the foreword and the prologue filler. Finally, Part 1 begins. The author tells us of his wealthy upbringing within a medical family and how he finally wants to be a doctor. Then he goes into great detail about dissecting dead bodies and even describes the practice of killing people and selling their dead bodies to doctors. Do we need to know this, or is this more filler? Then the author falls ill and I found the final 50 pages or so written by the author very controlled, very well written. He doesn't aim for tears, just the truth. And then, we get a 26 page epilogue by the wife. So we get a ton of filler material, and about 50 pages which are very good. But that's 50 pages out of 228. So five stars to Paul Kalanithi for sharing his story, especially the last fourth of the book in which he shares his painful decline. But one star to the absolutely enormous amount of filler here. We do have a 50 page beauty, and that would have been just fine for me. There is an excellent novella here but somebody wanted more words to put a $25.00 price tag on this book. "

It never crossed his mind, however, that he may one day be that very patient, his own tragic fate neatly sealed and delivered to him just as his career was about to take off. Kalanithi provides a gritty and insightful account of the daily life of a physician, recounting both his naivety as a medical student and his challenges as a neurosurgeon in residency. His career change was both admirable yet shocking - the jump from english literature to medicine is difficult, and choosing the most challenging specialty is difficult still. Full of thought-provoking philosophical reflections, gritty snippets of his professional and personal relationships, and most of all pages upon pages of resilience and strength, When Breath Becomes Air is a work that is complete inasmuch as it is incomplete. Even when given an estimation as to our time here on earth, we never really know when our end will actually come.  The epilogue, written by his wife Lucy, made me cry like a baby. “At home in bed a few weeks before he died, I asked him, “Can you breathe okay with my head on your chest like this?” His answer was “It’s the only way I know how to breathe.”4/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

But I am crying.What happened to Paul was tragic, but he was not a tragedy.This is the poignant story of Paul Kalanithi, someone who lived and died bravely.You can always says ‘It's not fair,’ or ‘It shouldn't have happened,’ and you'd be right : it's unfair, and it shouldn't have happened. These are truths. But I think this book is there for you to see beyond the unfairness, it's there to teach you something important : there is no such time as right now to go live your life.Because I would have to learn to live in a different way, seeing death as an imposing itinerant visitor but knowing that even if I’m dying, until I actually die, I am still living.I cried. I admit it. I cried while reading this book. More than once. It just touched something deep within me. Seeing how strong someone has to be just to go on living, just to get out of bed in the morning, to rethink their entire life . . . this is something people don't tell you about any illness : how much it actually sucks when you have to be your own biggest fan and your own worst enemy at the same time.I got out of bed and took a step forward, repeating the phrase over and over: “I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”I can't recommend this book enough. I don't have words.4.75"

I'm sure this would bring a torrent of abuse on me, but I'm afraid I must have more in the books I really like than this. It is a terrible tragedy that a young and successful man dies in agony at his prime. This guy was a surgeon, just finishing his internship after years of study. He had a baby on the way and a loving relationship with his wife and parents. His loss is so sad. However, for such a book to mean something more and be memorable to anyone but this guy's family, there must be more to it than just a tragic story. This one doesn't. Other cancer diaries that I've read have given me inspiration and much to think about in terms of finding meaning and joy in life before it ends. This one didn't - it was just terribly heart-breaking all through. Publishers should make a stop to this cancer-telling trend which started with The Last Lecture, and not publish unless the book has more to offer its readers. Otherwise its just suffering-porn. "
233,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Kalanithi was a 36 year old resident in neurosurgery with a young wife and a stellar career trajectory when he is diagnosed with aggressive lung cancer. Written during the final year of his life, this is one man’s confrontation with his own mortality. During the first half of the book, he narrates his journey from a literature major to a medical student prompted by philosophical questions about human existence. His interaction with patients ask him to grapple with the fragility of life and human suffering. In the second half, he becomes the patient; what he encountered through others become his personal reality. I was reluctant to open this book, fearing that it would be maudlin. But it was beautifully written. While sad, the goodness of life, no matter how short, dominated the lines. "

Plină de emoții,curaj și iubire (față de medicina,familie,prieteni și amintiri). Titlul descrie perfect modul in care am citit cartea,și nu glumesc. Paul rămâne a fi un exemplu admirabil al curajului,demnității,ambiție și efortului ! Ce este moartea? Ce prioritizezi tu ? Ce înseamnă să devii tată ,când este inedit dacă vei mai trăi doi ,cinci,zece ani sau câteva luni ? Sunt doar câteva din multele întrebări cu care se confrunta Paul.  Am savurat călătoria lui Paul de la etapa de Student de medicina,la Doctor Neurochirurg și,in final,muribund. Cartea m-a făcut sa contemplez asupra ce înseamnă ,de fapt,să fii un medic bun și unul nonșalant,ce doar își îndeplinește obligațiunile. Ce reprezintă cu adevarat Medicina,lucrul in spital,și farmecul acesteia de după cortine. Subiect tabu,pe care oamenii îl evită sau de care se lamentează ,dar descris atât de pedant și puternic de către Paul. E ,ironic și uimitor,in același timp sa urmărești cursul vieții sale : patosul pentru muncă,lupta pentru viața,curajul și cum învață să moară.  Lucrarea e scrisa intr-o formă lejera,aparent,se citește foarte ușor,dar se digeră greu. Am gasit-o delicioasă in termeni,fraze si cazuri medicale reale. In plus,este explicita,astfel,desi nu cunosc medicina,mi-a fost usor sa inteleg tot despre ce se vorbea in carte,rămânând si cu mici cunoștințe pe care le mai tin minte. Este admirabil cum cartea tratează medicina atât din perspectiva profesioanala,ce tine de cariera,succes și ascensiune,pe cât și din punct de vedere psiho-emoțional. Vorbind despre încrederea dintre doctor-pacient și conexiunile umane,precum și adevarata misiune sufleteasca a doctorului. De a se pune in piele pacientului,si a se gândi cum ar fi mai bine pentru acesta și nu doar al bifa pe lista ca “alt caz salvat”. E scrisă intim,cu lux de detalii ,ca pentru un prieten apropiat,in timpul in care autorului i se administra citostaticele in vene,pentru ai lungi cât mai mult cu putința viața. Scrisa in contratimp,in ultimele luni de supraviețuire,poartă un mesaj important. Moartea poate veni la 87,40 sau 19, neuitând-ne la asta intr-o societate careia ii este frica de ea,Paul ne transmite,ca doctor si ca pacient in faza terminala, cât de important este sa o acceptam,si sa percepem ce este prioritar pentru noi. Ne pune sa reflectam si sa vedem ca noi suntem produsul urmelor pe care le lăsam in urma.  Și,desigur,voi cita niște ipoteze ce mi-au plăcut: • “Inteligenta nu era suficientă,iar claritatea morală se dovedea și ea necesară.”• “A trebuit sa ajut respectivele familii sa priceapă ca omul pe care-l cunoșteau ,plin de viața,independent,trăia acum in trecutul lor și ca aveam nevoie de părerea lor ca sa-mi dau seama ce și-ar fi dorit el: o moarte ușoară sau o viața petrecuta între pungi cu fluide,[…],o viața in care nu mai era in stare să lupte.”• ”Caracterul definitoriu al organismului este lupta. Să descrii viața altfel ar însemna să pictezi un tigru fără dungi.”• ”Datoria medicului nu este să împiedice moartea sau să le înapoieze pacienților vechea lor viața ,ci să ia in brațe pacientul și familia,ale căror vieți au fost dezintegrate, și sa lucreze cu ei pana când se pot ridica pe picioarele lor și își pot înfrunta propria existența.”"

Prisipažinsiu - ašaras teko tramdyti ne kartą ir ne tik todėl, kad esu labai jautrus žmogus...Skaitant šį vieno labai drąsaus žmogaus gyvenimo ir mirties liudijimą išgyvenau labai daug įvairių minčių ir jausmų - juokiausi ir liūdėjau, stebėjausi ir didžiavausi tokiu įspūdingu bei atsakingu, mirštančio, bet vis dar gelbstinčio kitų gyvybes žmogaus darbu.Knyga verta kiekvienos minutės praleistos ją skaitant!O dabar šiek tiek iš asmeninės patirties...🔸Su malonumu skaičiau apie Paulo akušerijos ir ginekologijos praktiką, nes vos prieš porą savaičių pati praėjau šitą dalyką, vasarą taip pat ten teko atlikti praktiką.🔹Su neurochirurgija man taip pat teko susidurti atliekant paskaitos praktiką neuroonkologijos skyriuje. Kai kas skaitant atrodė taip pažįstama, kad net drebulys nupurtė, nes ta praktika, mane kaip žmogų paveikė labiausiai. Jaučiausi tokia bejėgė negalėdama padėti pacientei, kuriai staiga sutriko suvokimas, kalba - pasirodo jos smegenyse 5 navikai, o 4 iš jų neoperuojami. Taip pat liūdniausia buvo stebėti, kaip greitai viskas keičiasi ir iš gerų prognozių, teikiančių vilties, žmogus staiga sužino, kad tikriausiai jam išvis nebėra vilties padėti. Tie pacientai tampa tavo draugais ir nori tu ar nenori, įsileidi juos į savo mintis ir imi išgyventi tą skausmą su jais.Sunku būna, kai dirbi dirbi su pacientu ir atrodo viskas eina geryn, o tada staiga vieną dieną viskas pasidaro dar blogiau, nei prieš tau pradedant su juo dirbti...Arba kai pamatai pacientą po auglio šalinimo operacijos, negalintį nei piršto pajudinti, nors prieš ją jis puikiai viską galėjo... 🔸Reanimacijoje ir intensyvioje terapijoje verda didžiulė kova dėl gyvybės, ten pačios svarbiausios valandos. Ten teko irgi nemažai pabūti. Niekam niekada nelinkėčiau ten pakliūti.🔹Apie tai galėčiau kalbėti ir kalbėti, esmė ta, kad tikrai labai rekomenduoju šitą knygą.

Διάβασα όμως για αυτό στο blog του Χαράλαμπου Γιαννακόπουλου, κι ένιωσα αμέσως την ανάγκη να το αποκτήσω. Ο Paul Kalanithi ήταν ένας Αμερικάνος ειδικευόμενος νευροχειρουργός που σπούδασε πρώτα λογοτεχνία κι έπειτα ιατρική. Ο Paul πέθανε στα 36 του από γενικευμένο μεταστατικό καρκίνο, κι άφησε πίσω την γυναίκα και την κόρη του. Τους μήνες πριν πεθάνει έγραψε αυτό το βιβλίο, για το φοβερό πέρασμα από την ευθύνη για τον θάνατο ή την αναπηρία κάποιου άλλου, στην ευθύνη για τον δικό σου θάνατο. Έχω υπάρξει επαγγελματίας υγείας και κατανοώ βαθιά το πρώτο μέρος του βιβλίου. Εκεί ο Kalanithi εξηγεί πώς είναι να έχεις στην άκρη του νυστεριού σου και στην άκρη του μυαλού σου τη ζωή και τον θάνατο ενός ασθενούς. Πρέπει να συμφιλιωθείς με την ιδέα πως αν το νυστέρι πάει δύο χιλιοστά πιο μέσα, θα προκαλέσεις σύνδρομο «εγκλεισμού», κι αν πάει τρία, θα σκοτώσεις τον χειρουργούμενο. Πρέπει να συμφιλιωθείς με την ιδέα πως ακόμα κι αν το νυστέρι δεν πάει κατά λάθος πιο μέσα, οι ασθενείς σου θα πεθάνουν. Τι γίνεται όταν περνάς από την άλλη πλευρά της ρόμπας; Όταν δεν φοράς την πράσινη του χειρουργού, αλλά τη λευκή του ασθενούς. Τότε τα πράγματα γίνονται πιο προσωπικά. Ανάλογα το ποιος είσαι. Ο Kalanithi και η γυναίκα του ας πούμε, επέλεξαν να κάνουν ένα παιδί ενόσω εκείνος πέθαινε- ένα παιδί που δεν τους έτυχε, αλλά το επεδίωξαν να το γεννήσουν μέσω τεχνητής γονιμοποίησης. Το σοκ του θανάτου ενός ανθρώπου που είναι ακόμα απελπιστικά νέος κι έχει πολλή ζωή να ζήσει ακόμα, με κάποιο τρόπο μετριάζεται όταν το διηγείται ο ίδιος. Όταν αναλαμβάνει την ευθύνη της αφήγησης. Όταν μπορεί να σημαδέψει την τράπουλα. Αυτό μικραίνει και το σοκ του αναγνώστη, δίνει άλλη προοπτική στο δικό του άγχος θανάτου. Και τον στηρίζει- πιο δυνατά και με περισσότερη ενσυναίσθηση- από οποιοδήποτε αμιγώς λογοτεχνικό κείμενο."

Tốt nghiệp cử nhân và thạc sĩ Văn học Anh và Sinh học người, tốt nghiệp xuất sắc ở trường Y và cuối cùng quyết định trở thành một bác sĩ thần kinh. Tại sao một người vừa có ý muốn theo đuổi nghệ thuật lại cùng lúc chọn trở thành một bác sĩ? Câu hỏi được đặt ra với Paul, trong mọi thời điểm đó là việc ý nghĩa của cuộc sống là gì?

Sau những ca phẫu thuật hàng giờ đồng hồ từ sáng đến tối, 7 năm làm bác sĩ nội trú và những năm tháng cuối đời chiến đấu với bệnh tật, Paul đã lựa chọn sống hết mình và sống một cuộc đời có ý nghĩa với bản thân và gia đình dù cuộc đời anh chỉ rất ngắn ngủi.""Chúng tôi mang trên mình một cái ách nặng nề về trách nhiệm trọng đại.

This is a book that everyone should read—it is that good.Paul Kalanithi was a polymath. He graduated from Stanford with a BA and MA in English literature and a BA in human biology (he did, after all come from a family of doctors). He went on to earn a MPhil in history and philosophy of science and medicine from the University of Cambridge, before admitting to himself that he was called to pursue medicine. He graduated cum laude from the Yale School of Medicine, before returning to Stanford to complete his residency training in neurological surgery and a postdoctoral fellowship in neuroscience. He died much too soon—just 37 years old from lung cancer leaving a wife and infant daughter behind.This recounts his journey from learning that he had stage IV lung cancer to his eventual death—but it is SO MUCH MORE than that. Kalanithi talks about his neurosurgical experience operating on the brain and how delicate it is. Only one who understands philosophy so well can convey how careful a surgeon must be in order to protect the essence of a human being. What is life? What makes it worth living? Kalanithi was driving himself hard during his residency trying to achieve perfection in his surgical technique and patient care. It was impacting his marriage negatively. And then cancer struck. And he had to create a new future for himself. He had once wanted to be a writer, and writing this book became his passion in the last months of his life. Highly recommend."

246,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5586131-melora,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow. I don't know what to say about this one. It is profound and sad, but also inspiring. I rarely cry over books, but this one brought me to tears. As much about taking seriously what makes a life worth living as it is about how one might handle death's approach, Paul Kalanithi brings literature, philosophy, faith, and science together in this story of a man bent on living a meaningful life who comes to what he thought was to be the beginning of his career and family life only to find that he is facing the end, but who manages to face that end with composure and grace.Kalanithi's supportive family, comfortable economic situation, and the fact that he has health insurance and access to the best possible medical care make his experience of death from lung cancer, horrible as it is, rather different from that which most people with the same diagnosis would have. However, his circumstances and education allow him to tell the story of his focus on priorities when faced with a rapidly looming but uncertain death, rather than a tale of desperation, financial ruin, and frustration with a complex and uncaring medical system. His tone sometimes feels a bit detached, but it's generally not, and “detached” seems preferable to “overwrought”, which I expect are the two ends of the tonal spectrum when one is writing about one's imminent demise. Abraham Verghese's introductory piece is a waste of paper, but the Epilogue by Paul's wife, Lucy Kalanithi, is wonderful."

A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.""--Mark TwainWhen Breath Becomes Air is the memoir of Paul Kalanithi, a neurosurgeon at Stanford University, who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in his mid-thirties. Kalanithi who completed degrees in both English literature and human biology writes, “I was driven less by achievement than by trying to understand, in earnest: What makes human life meaningful? I still felt literature provided the best account of the life of the mind, while neuroscience laid down the most elegant rules of the brain.” He makes a beautiful argument explaining the role of both fact and creativity in the task of understanding the human condition. He uses the pages in this book to not only tell his story, but also to share his ideas on how to approach death with grace and what it means to be fully alive. Abundant with poetically written prose, When Breath Becomes Air is an exquisite and stirring read about a man who faced death with both dignity and fortitude."

I am so grateful that I decided to pick this up and in turn gained so many valuable lessons. I am deeply touched by Paul Kalanithi's admirable bravery and wisdom, facing his death with such spirit and integrity with the aid of his loving family, and always being authentic to the soul. From start till the end, I was reduced to an uncontrollable sobbing mess, both grief-stricken and thoroughly moved by his arduous yet meaningful and purposeful journey, also feeling blessed and comforted that his words will continue to live on and no doubt inspire a great mass of people. “I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”“But knowing that even if I’m dying, until I actually die, I am still living.”“Words have a longevity I do not.” “When there is no place for the scalpel, words are the surgeon’s only tool.”“We all have a notion of what it means to be good, and we can’t live up to it all the time.”"

Paul was diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 36. He was just completing his residency and was planning a life ahead with his wife Lucy. He came up with the idea of writing a book after the diagnosis, and he died before publishing it.As a doctor, Paul had witnessed many births and deaths. He’d seen the life of a patient from the other side. He narrates how his life, perspectives and priorities changed during his transition from a doctor to a patient, with the realisation that his time is limited. This is not a story of bravery. He was afraid to die like any other dying patients, and was forced to embrace it without a choice.Life of Paul Kalanithi is both heartbreaking and beautiful. It made me think about the choices we make during the critical moments of our lives. The book may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but I loved it."

There are some stories you love in the moment and then forget all about them the next week. Some stay with you and pop up in difficult situations. And then there are those which have the power to totally change your path and make you observe the world in a different light. This book, without exaggeration, changed a small part of me. Made me see a bit of things in my life in a new light. His struggle to his new reality is heartbreaking yet oh so inspiring. Being a medical student, I related and understood so much of his early struggles and possibly will never truly understand his later ones. How he started seeing his life in the looming shadow of death. How he found religion again. Everything. His journey is heartbreaking yet beautiful. Loved every minute of it.

260,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3831795-nelson-zagalo,Rating 5 out of 5,"""When Breath Becomes Air"" é um livro de memórias de Paul Kalanithi, a quem com 36 anos, no final de uma residência médica de 6 anos como neurocirurgião e prestes a conseguir o seu diploma, foi diagnosticado um cancro nível IV (inoperável) nos pulmões (sem nunca ter fumado). Ao longo das parcas 220 páginas (morreu antes de o poder terminar), que se lêem de uma vez, somos conduzidos pelo relato das opções e decisões tomadas ao longo de uma vida que permitiram a Paul Kalanithi chegar ao final da sua formação médica e escrever um livro pleno de expressividade. O seu livro tem servido de inspiração um pouco por todo o mundo — de Bill Gates a Andrew Solomon ou Atul Gawande —, tendo o Departamento de Medicina da Universidade de Stanford, onde se formou, criado mesmo, um ano depois da sua morte, o Prémio Kalanithi Writing para obras sobre pacientes em fim de vida ou cuidados paliativos.[Para ler com imagens, formatação e todos os links ler no blog: https://virtual-illusion.blogspot.com...]Da minha intensa experiência de leitura, comparei-a com o relato da ""The Last Lecture"" de Randy Pausch (1960 - 2008), professor e investigador — de Entretenimento Digital na Carnegie Mellon — morto de cancro no pâncreas. Se Pausch me tinha tocado imenso, foi muito provavelmente catalisado por ser uma pessoa no meu campo científico, alguém que admirava, seguia e lia o seu trabalho de forma regular, contudo desta vez o embate parecia-me ser maior. No entanto, se tenho estudado imenso o que se vai fazendo no campo das neurociências, nem por isso tenho qualquer familiaridade com a neurocirugia. Por outro lado, este relato de Kalanithi fez-me recordar ainda um outro, não de fim de vida, ainda que também de memórias mas de alguém no ativo, ""Sinto Muito"" de Nuno Lobo Antunes, sobre a ala neuropedriátrica e os efeitos dos tratamentos oncológicos em tenras idades.[imagem]A edição portuguesa foi editada pela Saída de Emergência sob o título ""Antes de Eu Partir""Pensei assim que a intensidade da experiência se devia ao fator cérebro, aliás como diz a certa altura Paul Kalanithi, ""a medicina relacionada com o cérebro comporta algo de esotérico que nos atrai e terrifica"". Mas agora que escrevo estas linhas percebo que não foi só pela área de trabalho, foi claramente pelo modo como Kalanithi se expôs, e acima de tudo conseguiu exteriorizar e plasmar na escrita a sua percepção do mundo. Ora a isto não é alheio à formação de Kalanithi, que antes de estudar medicina fez licenciatura e mestrado em Literatura Inglesa, ao que se seguiu um mestrado em Biologia Humana ainda em Stanford, e depois um outro mestrado em História da Ciência e Medicina na Universidade de Cambridge. Foi apenas no final dos estudos em Cambridge que Kalanithi decidiu que queria ser médico, e para isso teve de voltar ao início, fazer provas e conseguir entrar em Medicina em Yale. Até esta altura Kalanithi acalentava a ideia de poder vir a tornar-se escritor.Aliás, o autor fala do momento em que desistiu da literatura para abraçar a medicina, como um momento de viragem, em que bateu na parede pelo lado das letras. A sua ânsia era compreender o ser humano, e vinha acreditando que lá poderia chegar pela literatura, mas entretanto percebeu que em vez de se aproximar se estava a distanciar cada vez mais da vida efetiva. Por isso decidiu enveredar por um caminho que lhe permitisse ""tocar na carne"", assistir à vida de modo empírico. Por sua vez, já no final, quando decide escrever este livro, é exatamente por sentir o contrário. Por sentir, que a única forma de chegar ao que sentia dentro de si era por via da escrita, não tinha outra forma de conseguir compreender o que sentia. Talvez por isso mesmo o livro seja tão intenso, porque ele é uma busca pessoal por respostas para uma vida, tentativa de explicação de um momento, ainda que possa depois ter ficado como legado.Nada disto é novo, a literatura, tal como as restantes artes servem-nos há milénios na compreensão do humano. Se a ciência nos ajuda a compreender os processos e os como, só a arte nos consegue explicar os porquê. Damásio dizia em 2017: ""Quando me perguntam qual é o maior cientista de sempre, respondo: na minha área, é Shakespeare""; e enquanto muitos se admiram com estas palavras, o belíssimo livro de Jonah Lehrer ""Proust era um Neurocientista"" data já de 2007. Mas esta discussão não tem qualquer sentido de novidade, já que ela esteve presente desde o início da nossa civilização, com Platão a divergir de Aristóteles na importância que se deve conferir as artes.Para fechar. Este foi um dos últimos 'memoirs' que li, um género que antigamente desconhecia por o associar à mera biografia, mas que aprendi a amar por via da banda desenhada. Existe algo de muito particular nestes livros, não apenas em fim de vida, mas no simples facto de se apresentarem em primeira pessoa, mais ainda quando as pessoas possuem as ferramentas adequadas para a escrita. As descrições, quando conseguidas, do pensar interior são autêntica telepatia, como disse o próprio Stephen King no seu memoir. E nesse sentido, julgo que estas obras acabam funcionando como o píncaro do objetivo e razão porque inventámos a linguagem e a escrita.Publicado no blog VI:https://virtual-illusion.blogspot.com..."

Δεν ξέρω τι ήταν τελικά αυτό που με ώθησε στο να παρακάμψω αυτή την πρόωρη και αυθαίρετη κρίση και να το διαβάσω τελικά, πάντως χαίρομαι πάρα πολύ που το έκανα.Ο άνθρωπος πίσω από το βιβλίο είναι ένας γιατρός και πιο συγκεκριμένα ένας νευροχειρούργος με έξτρα σπ��υδές στη λογοτεχνία, ο Paul Kalanithi. Ο Kalanithi διαγιγνώστηκε με καρκίνο στα 36 του χρόνια και η πρώτη σκέψη που έκανε ήταν ότι δεν είχε γράψει τίποτα στη ζωή του. Ξεκινά λοιπόν να γράφει το βιβλίο αυτό, χωρίς να γνωρίσει εάν θα προλάβει να το τελειώσει.Το βιβλίο χωρίζεται σε δύο μέρη. Το πρώτο, αφορά στην ζωή του πριν τη διάγνωση. Δεν πλατιάζει, όπως φοβόμουν. Εστιάζει περισσότερο στις επαγγελματικές του επιλογές, την σχέση του με τη λογοτεχνία, τη φιλοσοφία και τους προβληματισμούς του ως γιατρός. Ο θάνατος υπάρχει σαν ιδέα και φαίνεται να τον απασχολεί: τον συναντά, πάντα στα σώματα των ασθενών του, τον παρατηρεί, προσπαθεί να τον ξορκίσει, κάποιες φορές επιτυχώς, κάποιες ανεπιτυχώς. Προσπαθεί να εξοικειώσει τον εαυτό του με αυτόν, ενώ παράλληλα θέτει και ζητήματα ηθικής ως προς την καθημερινότητα του επαγγέλματός του. Για άλλη μια φορά μας επιβεβαιώνει αυτό που ήδη ξέρουμε ή υποψιαζόμαστε: ότι η Ιατρική είναι μια επιλογή ζωής, όχι απλώς καριέρας, που απαιτεί τόσο μεγάλες θυσίες που συχνά σε κάνει να αμφιβάλλεις για το αν ακολούθησες το σωστό μονοπάτι. Το μόνο που με κούρασε στο πρώτο μέρος ήταν η αναλυτική περιγραφή ιατρικών περιστατικών ή η γενικότερη χρήση ιατρικών όρων, καθότι δεν είμαι και του επαγγέλματος.Το δεύτερο μέρος του βιβλίου είναι η ζωή μετά τη διάγνωση. Όπως είναι φυσικό, ο Paul έχει όνειρα: να γίνει καθηγητής, να ερευνήσει, να προσφέρει στον τομέα του, να κάνει οικογένεια. Μετά τη διάγνωση, τα περιθώρια στενεύουν και πρέπει να αποφασίσει τι έχει τελικά περισσότερη σημασία γι' αυτόν. Και ενώ όλοι έχουμε την αίσθηση ότι όταν έρχεσαι αντιμέτωπος με το θάνατο, ξαφνικά σου αποκαλύπτονται όλα τα μυστικά της ζωής και μαθαίνεις τι ήθελες να γίνεις από πάντα, ο Paul μας τρίβει την πικρή αλήθεια στη μούρη αποκαλύπτοντας το χάος που συνέβαινε στο δικό του μυαλό και αποκωδικοποιώντας με αξιοθαύμαστη νηφαλιότητα που θα ζήλευε κάθε ψυχοθεραπευτής τις πράξεις του. Από γιατρός, γίνεται ασθενής. Ένα από τα χειρότερα πράγματα του να ασθενεί ένας γιατρός με τερματική ασθένεια είναι η γνώση. Η γνώση στην προκειμένη περίπτωση αποτελεί μεγάλη κατάρα. Ο Paul ξέρει σχεδόν κάθε στιγμή τι του συμβαίνει, ποιες εξετάσεις πρέπει να γίνουν, ποιες οι επιλογές θεραπείας, αλλά δεν ξέρει ένα πράγμα, το οποίο η γιατρός του αρνείται -ορθώς- να συζητήσει μαζί του: τις ακριβείς πιθανότητες επιβίωσης.Πρόκειται για ένα βιβλίο απλό και συγχρόνως σύνθετο ως προς το νόημά του, βαθιά συγκινητικό και όμορφα γραμμένο. Αντιμετωπίζοντας το θάνατο, ο Paul Kalanithi στοχάζεται και φιλοσοφεί. Χωρίς φλυαρία, χωρίς αοριστία, βάζοντας σε τάξη τις σκέψεις του, προσπαθεί να μας εξοικειώσει με το ταξίδι προς το θάνατο, αλλά και να εξοικειωθεί και ο ίδιος.Να μην πολυλογώ, μου άρεσε. Ήταν μια τίμια προσπάθεια αυτοβιογραφίας, χωρίς φανφάρες και κυρίως χωρίς τα γνωστά χολιγουντιανά κλισέ που υπάρχουν σε αντίστοιχες αυτοβιογραφίες, αλλά και μυθιστορήματα του τύπου ""ανακάλυψα το νόημα της ζωής μόλις διαγνώσθηκα με καρκίνο"". Για του λόγου το αληθές, παραθέτω:“Grand illnesses are supposed to be life-clarifying. Instead, I knew I was going to die—but I’d known that before. My state of knowledge was the same, but my ability to make lunch plans had been shot to hell. The way forward would seem obvious, if only I knew how many months or years I had left. Tell me three months, I’d spend time with family. Tell me one year, I’d write a book. Give me ten years, I’d get back to treating diseases. The truth that you live one day at a time didn’t help: What was I supposed to do with that day?”Θα το πρότεινα σίγουρα σε άτομα που είναι γιατροί ή σπουδάζουν ιατρική και σε άτομα που ασχολούνται με την υποστήριξη ατόμων με τερματικές ασθένειες.Βαθμολογία: ★★★★☆ (4/5)"

Có điều có lẽ mặt trái của nghe sách nói là đôi khi vừa đi mình vừa suy nghĩ vấn đề gì đó rất lung, tâm trí bị cuốn đi nên bỏ lỡ một vài đoạn, phải tua lại. Mình nghe xong thì quyết định mua một bản sách giấy để làm kỷ niệm. Tác giả viết rất hay, nhiều câu rất thơ, bản dịch hơi bám tiếng Anh nhưng cũng rất tốt. Khuyên đọc. Mình trích lại một số đoạn hay. “Thời gian với tôi như một con dao hai lưỡi: Mỗi ngày mang tôi đi xa khỏi thời điểm tệ hại của lần phát bệnh trước nhưng gần hơn tới lần tái phát kế tiếp - và cuối cùng, cái chết. Có lẽ muộn hơn tôi nghĩ, nhưng chắc chắn là sớm hơn tôi mong muốn.”“Chẩn đoán ung thư phổi là chắc chắn. Một tương lai được lên kế hoạch tỉ mỉ và khó khăn lắm mới đạt được này đã không còn tồn tại nữa. Cái chết, vốn rất quen thuộc với tôi trong công việc, nay lại ghé thăm riêng tôi. Ta ở đây, mặt đối mặt, vậy mà dường như không thể nhận ra điều gì về nó. Tại một ngã tư đường nơi lẽ ra tôi có thể nhìn và theo dõi dấu chân của vô số bệnh nhân tôi đã từng chữa trị, thay vào đó tôi chỉ thấy một sa mạc trắng lập lòe đầy trống rỗng khắc nghiệt, như thể một cơn bão đã xóa bỏ mọi dấu vết quen thân.”“Con đường phía trước có lẽ sẽ rõ ràng nếu như tôi biết chính xác mình còn bao nhiêu tháng, bao nhiêu năm. Cho tôi ba tháng, tôi dành thời gian cho gia đình. Cho tôi một năm, tôi sẽ viết sách. Cho tôi mười năm, tôi sẽ quay trở lại với việc chữa bệnh. Cái sự thực rằng bạn sẽ sống thêm từng ngày một chẳng có ý nghĩa gì: Tôi sẽ làm gì với ngày đó đây?”"

The epilogue had me blinking back tears on the drive home.. (read by his wife)Would highly recommend. “Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete.” “That message is simple: When you come to one of the many moments in life when you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying man��s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more, but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.” “You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.” “I began to realize that coming in such close contact with my own mortality had changed both nothing and everything. Before my cancer was diagnosed, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. After the diagnosis, I knew that someday I would die, but I didn’t know when. But now I knew it acutely. The problem wasn’t really a scientific one. The fact of death is unsettling. Yet there is no other way to live.” “The physician’s duty is not to stave off death or return patients to their old lives, but to take into our arms a patient and family whose lives have disintegrated and work until they can stand back up and face, and make sense of, their own existence.” “Literature not only illuminated another’s experience, it provided, I believed, the richest material for moral reflection. My brief forays into the formal ethics of analytic philosophy felt dry as a bone, missing the messiness and weight of real human life.” “I expected to feel only empty and heartbroken after Paul died. It never occurred to me that you could love someone the same way after he was gone, that I would continue to feel such love and gratitude alongside the terrible sorrow, the grief so heavy that at times I shiver and moan under the weight of it.” "

This book walks us through some of the profound moments of Paul’s life, what he saw and how he felt, and how these events impacted and shaped his life.It was Paul’s love of literature, and his interest in biological philosophy that would one day lead him to become a neurosurgeon. Books and words connect people and it’s this connection—relationships—that make life meaningful. The process of experiencing life occurs in the brain, but sometimes the brain is broken or isn’t working properly. Paul wanted to help people, and to understand himself just what makes life worth living.The beautifully written epilogue, which was written by his wife Lucy, will break your heart, and give you hope at the same time.

Overcoming the twin obstacles of rich doctor parents and a Stanford University education, Paul beats the odds to make it all the way to Yale Medical School and a neurosurgical residency.Along the way Paul learns important lessons in life, like how being a good surgeon is very much the same thing as Jesus being crucified (if only Jesus had also driven home from Golgotha in a 7 series BMW, I presume).You will be impressed by Paul's ability to show how much better and more extensive his literary knowledge is than yours, with extensive quotes and references not in the least bit shoehorned in at every opportunity: The King James Bible, Elliot, Huxley, Beckett, Tolstoy, Shakespeare, Beckett, again, it's all there. Whilst an opportunity to include Dr Seuss's famous treatise on surgery 'the Clown in the Gown', was missed, readers' experience will not be too impoverished by the omission.The book is also so filled with such profound insights as 'doctors need hope too’ and 'patients are human beings’ there obviously was no room for 'I’m sure glad I have decent health insurance and don't have to die in a trailer park to pay my medical bills.’"

Well, I managed to get through the foreword before closing the book, gathering my thoughts and contemplating the words I'd just read. I knew then that I was going to be in for a fairly emotional ride.It's no secret that I'm fascinated by all things medical. I'm curious about the human body, germs, surgeons and surgeries. And so I had a sneaky suspicion I was going to enjoy this book. But here's the thing - you don't need to harbor a secret medical fascination to enjoy this book. Yes, the author was training as a neurosurgeon, but this book isn't strictly about that. It's a book about mortality, about life, about death, about living, about hopes and dreams, about what constitutes a meaningful life. For me, in a way, this was also a tiny downside to the book. I say this because there are parts of this book that are very philosophical. I would actually refer to this book as an ""intellectual"" read. Although this book does read like a story and although the author does tell the reader about his journey to becoming a neurosurgeon, including giving examples of things he saw and patients he treated, the book is very much a discussion about life, about what it means to have lived a good life and about how to face death. And yes, I did enjoy those discussions but I was more fascinated by the medical side to the story, and the human side. About how it felt to receive such a terrible diagnosis, to have to give up your ""calling"" and the career that you had trained so hard for, to know that your death was closer than you ever could have imagined.But let me tell you something, this is a wonderful read. It's a book that made me get up in the morning, dress for work, get into the traffic, think about the files on my desk and everything I had to get done that day, and actually feel happy about it. This book made me feel happy to be alive, to have my health, to know that all my loved ones had their health, to be in a position where I was able to go to work and worry about mundane things. One question kept ringing in my head while reading this book - ""why are some people given wonderful lives and other's not?"". This is a book that will make you think about that a lot. And as we all know, there is no answer to that question. It's a great read. Sad but wonderful.Many thanks to Penguin Random House SA, Penguin UK as well as to the author and Lucy, for my review copy."
282,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8580060-kacey,Rating 5 out of 5,"I want to take this book, and force it on every medical professional I’ve ever known. What’s so important to me about this book is not only it’s look at terminal illness, and finding the meaning of life on the verge of death, but it’s examination of what it means to be a physician. Paul constantly is reminding himself of why he went into medicine, and how doctors (including himself) start to look at patients as just patients, instead of the human beings they are underneath their illness. —————————(I wrote my original review a year ago, but it all still rings true)To preface this review, there are two very important facts about me that strongly influenced how I read this book:1. I am currently was in school to become an RN (before health reasons made me take a break)2. Less than 6 months ago, I was diagnosed with a nearly inoperable brain tumor.If you’ve read this book, or even just the synopsis of it, you can see why I found it extremely relatable. Paul is a neurosurgeon in his last year of residency. This book is a look at his collective thoughts on the physiological experience of life and death. From his time as a doctor, to his own journey on the path to death, this captures the essence of what it means to live as we face our own mortality.As a student on my way to join the grueling world of the medical field, and as a patient with an entire host of people on my medical team (neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, geneticists, occupational therapists, etc.), I found this at times to be both poignantly relatable, and excruciatingly painful. All of his seemingly endless post-diagnosis questions have found themselves running through my own mind: Should I continue on this path I’ve worked towards? Will my child live a lesser life without one of her parents? What kind of life have I been living? What have I been doing with that life? What inherently matters to me?What makes human life meaningful?The raw truth of this memoir hit me like a jack hammer. I’ve spent the last few months in and out of doctors offices, spending hours in MRI machines, CT scans, blood work, neurological exams, and never ending questions about my physical capabilities. I related to Paul on such a deep, painful level. I've been the one studying the human body, and I've been the body being studied. Although I am not “dying” (but aren’t we all?) the uncertainty of life is a limbo I will live until my own clock stops ticking. Like he addresses in his memoir, it is almost worse to tread the path of uncertainty than it is to face, and accept, the certain door of death. I have the knowledge of what will most likely cause my demise, without any perceivable timeline, just a finite clarity of the end. It’s unsettling, this acute awareness of deaths inescapability.  All we have is the knowledge of our circumstances, and the solutions that don’t exist to change it.
“'Why me?' (Answer: Why not me?)""
Yes, this is a book about death, but more importantly, it’s about the life we live in spite of that inevitability.  You have a choice, and Paul reminded me of my choice. Live in fear, or live in hope and love. You can spend your days wishing to change your circumstances, or you can accept your circumstances and spend your days cherishing the laughter of your children, the smile of your significant other, the way the sun glows in the morning sun rise, even enjoying a spirited Christmas in your childhood home.
""We would carry on living, instead of dying.""
I think the hardest part of this book was reading about Paul’s daughter, Cady. My daughter was just shy of two when I got my own diagnosis. There’s something even harder about bringing a child into a world of unpredictability than just living in one yourself. Knowing that I might leave this world much earlier than her and I are ready for is something I don’t think any parent can accept. But Paul reminded me that in whatever days I have, I can give her a life worth remembering, and I can give myself immeasurable joy found in her beauty and her love. Even in the shadow of death, there is always, life.I needed this. More than I knew.

“Why? Because I could. Because that’s who I was. Because I would have to learn to live in a different way, seeing death as an imposing itinerant visitor but knowing that even if I’m dying, until I actually die, I am still living.”

""And with that, the future I had imagined, the one just about to be realized, the culmination of decades of striving, evaporated.""  2.Cease not till death:  ""Shouldn't terminal illness, then, be the perfect gift to that young man who had wanted to understand death? What better way to understand it than to live it?""  In this part we'll see how Paul will suffer during his 2 yrs of illness. how he turned from this to this:if you know that your death is near, what will you do? .. Paul asked him self this question, will he continue Neurosurgery or stay at home and become a writer he always wanted to be? Paul decided to be both. ""Thanks to When breath becomes air, those of us who never met Paul Kalanithi will both mourn his death and benefit from his life"" -Ann Patchett I advice everyone to read it! but be careful, between the first page and the last page, many things will change, as Paul approach death, you may want to drop everything and start a new life, a life with a meaning!  ""once you learn how to die, you learn how to live""  ------one of many things that broke my heart is the fact that this book isn't finished, Paul couldn't finish it, he was so ill, which reminds me of John Green's quotes “That's part of what I like about the book in some ways. It portrays death truthfully. You die in the middle of your life, in the middle of a sentence”  ----writing this review & reading the book weren't easy.. my eyes are full of tears as I end it while I listen to this piece of art by Hans zimmer Hans Zimmer-Time"
284,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42662881-fadwa,Rating 5 out of 5,"Full review originally posted on my blog: 

Word Wonders

The writing is absolutely eloquent. Dr. Kalanithi was such a talented writer. You know how I always say I’m not a non-fiction person because of writing, right? How it always feels matter-of-factly and stripped of any emotion? Well, it wasn’t the case at all here, the neurosurgeon’s writing style is breathtaking and lyrical, you can see from that his love and respect for literature, both of which he mentions a lot throughout the book while also quoting writers and philosophers that inspired him in one way or another. He was also very good at conveying a sense of what he was feeling not only while writing his memoir but also while living the events he wrote about.This review will be more of a personal thing than a proper critical review because this book hit me harder than I expected, in more ways than I expected and impacted me more profoundly than anything I could’ve imagined. Dr. Kalanithi wrote this book after being diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer so maybe most people would expect it to be about his battle against the illness but it’s not. Not the first half of it anyway. This book tackles so many aspects of life, of his life, from his childhood up until the end.What impacted me the most was his experiences through his medical studies, his wins, losses, struggles, and huge responsibilities. You all know by now that I am a medstudent, so I’ll forever be grateful for what this book did to me, especially because I read it while I was going through rough times. It comforted me in my questions and doubts in my own journey and it showed me that even though things don’t get easier (let’s not kid ourselves) they do get better. I laughed, I cried and I found myself nodding in approval. His journey was really an inspiring one, a motivational one even, because he had a purpose, a drive and most of all empathy that some medical students and doctors lose along the way. But he didn’t, he never did.As Dr. Kalanithi goes through physical and mental changes after his diagnosis, he starts reflecting on life, its meaning, what matters and what doesn’t, with even more urgency than ever before, it becomes a kind of obsession -not in a bad way. Which made this book more about life than death, about living it to its fullest capacity, while keeping in mind that death is prominent, that it is coming. I know. We don’t like to think about that stuff but as he makes it evident in When Breath Becomes Air, it is important to register that in order to start living. As the end of the book approaches -and his death nears- you can feel a change in his writing as well, it becomes more raw and pressing (if that makes any sense), like he needed to say everything he wanted to say before he couldn’t do it anymore.The epilogue was written by his wife after his death and it was such a beautiful and hopeful addition to the book, an outsider’s look on what we read about throughout the book as well as what life was like afterwards, how important family was to him and to his wife and baby daughter after he was gone. Her contribution was so touching and emotional, her love for him really bled through the pages.Like I said, as a medical student, I have a very deep appreciation for this book, it quickly became my favorite non-fiction as well as one of my favorite books of all time. But I truly believe that this is a book that everyone should read, because each person can relate to it to some extent, some parts of it go beyond the illness, or ever beyond his experiences as a neurosurgeon. They’re simply human, and profoundly humbling."

Vienna is like a dull version of Berlin, Berlin without the sex appeal. And there are so many tourists, so many Americans. The public transportation? Not as good as Seoul. I don't want to pay obscene prices to enter museums, don't want to go out and meet new people, am not even enjoying the coffee. And it's not Vienna. It's me, trudging through, from snow storms in Norway to cherry blossoms in Korea, from hiking in the Alps to Hong Kong's art scene. I'm eternally grateful for all these opportunities but I'm homesick. It took me a few days to narrow it down but here it is: after 8 months away from home, I'm tired. I'm tired and it's okay, it's okay to be tired. In these moments, Paul Kalanithi's voice was a comfort. As I close this period of my life, as I question what the meaning of it all is, as I feel so out of my depth, an imposter no matter where I go, so apt at living out of a suitcase, I needed this reminder. Life begins and it ends, it is up to us to forge the story, to chase after what is meaningful to us. Nothing is as big as I think it is, nothing is quite as important as the present and what it holds. Kalanithi spent his life questioning humanity, be it the mechanics of life as a surgeon or through the words we rely on in literature. I read this entire book cover to cover, instead of going outside. I was blown away by the phenomenal writing, the deep insights and the intriguing questions. Kalanithi comes to terms with his own death, builds a new life with his daughter, writes this book. He did not have enough time but you can't help but feel that he was able to end his life at peace, with dignity and fullness. As always, the idea of medicine baffles me. A human being able to reach through our brain, to touch parts and see changes, it is so hard to actually wrap my mind around. How much responsibility, how can personhood be contained in physical material. Kalanithi writes several times that he is a protector of people's identity, not just their life. What a remarkable idea. This review is so rambley and fuck it, it's not surprising that Europeans are so into talking about climate change when no one has AC. I can't recommend this book enough. Well written, insightful, weirdly comforting and yet, deeply tragic. It touches on the core parts of life with striking beauty and compassion.  What I'm Taking With Me- His thoughts on religion were fascinating- does atheism necessarily believe all knowledge is scientific? - And there isn't room here to discuss how many thoughts this left me about medical care and what the role of doctors actually is, ideas of agency and ownership and selfhood. - The idea that he never got to truly know his daughter remains heartbreaking. -------------------This book left me crying in a Starbucks in Vienna.

286,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3332502-maya,Rating 4 out of 5,"Отношенията ми с тази книга започнаха с трескавото й търсене малко преди да излезе на български. Някак се бях заблудила, че ще се появи около месец по-рано и притесних няколко книжарници с настояването си, че книгата трябва вече да е при тях. Ами не беше. Изтеглих си я на английски, сърдита, че съм се заблудила. И се зачетох. Чак после си я взех и на български и я прочетох отново отначало.Пол Каланити е в края на специализацията си по неврохирургия, когато открива, че е болен от рак на белия дроб, злокачествен, с много метастази и много малки шансове за ефективно лечение. И така, човекът, който още от рано се е вълнувал от въпроса за това какъв е смисълът на живота и в крайна сметка тази сплав от вълнения към биологията, етиката и литературата, го е тласнала към професията на неврохирурга, този човек сега трябва да намери смисъла на своя живот, живот, с неясна продължителност и с особено ясно усещане за край.Странно е да четеш книга, знаейки, че авторът вече го няма, но до съвсем скоро е бил наоколо. Странно е да прелистваш страници, в които собствените ти преживявания от студенстването по медицина, аутопсиите, упражненията в анатомичните зали, първото раждане, на което си присъствал и собствените ти мисли през тези години, надничат от всяка страница, от всеки ред.Един човек, който толкова прилича на теб, че можеш да го почувстваш близък, но никога не си го познавал, а и няма да го познаваш, защото човекът си е отишъл, всъщност си е отишъл даже доста по-млад от тебе. А пък ти си още наоколо и си ги мислиш много от тези неща.Книгата на Каланити хвърля много светлина върху въпроса защо е толкова трудно човек да е лекар. Както и върху въпроса защо е толкова трудно човек да бъде пациент. Тънката граница между двете, която изглежда така нереална, когато носиш на врата си стетоскопа, всъщност е много по-крехка и във всеки един момент може да се окаже, че сме я прекосили. И че имаме нужда от човещина и човешко присъствие.Въпросите, които вълнуват Каланити са въпроси, които трудно влизат в полезрението на професионалистите в българските болници, студентски аудитории и официанлите професионални дебати, но те вълнуват професионалистите и за съжаление това личи в частните разговори помежду им. И на мен това ми се струва много жалко.След като затворих и последната страница, мисля си, че си струва тази книга да влезе в аудит��риите на медицинските университети и да бъде прочетена, разнищена до последното изречение, обсъдена и анализирана от всеки лекар и всеки студент по медицина. Толкова ми се струва важно всеки от нас да усети колко е близо до собствения си край и да си го припомня във всеки един момент, особено когато е облякъл бялата престилка и стане част от живота на хора в момент на страдание и болка."
287,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21351927-pooja,Rating 5 out of 5,"This book was devastatingly beautiful. I finished reading it yesterday evening but after I reached it's end, I set it aside, trying to dissect the multitude of emotions that were running through me.Are you familiar with the feeling you get when you read something so poignant that your heart literally aches? Reading this entire book was like that. Paul Kalanithi, at the age of 36, had everything he aspired to have. He was on the verge of completing a decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, was married to his long term girlfriend, had bright future prospects and had his future planned out. The path that lead him to his 'calling', as he called it, as a neurosurgeon is a very interesting one. He majored in literature and biologically as an undergrad and then went on to do a masters in literature. It was then he realised something which he put very well - ""Literature provided a rich account of human meaning; the brain, then, was the machinery that somehow enabled it. It seemed like magic."" He always seemed to be pondering on the various aspects of life. What gives life it's meaning? What is it that makes life worth living? What is the optimal way of living it? Even before cancerous tumors took over his body, he contemplated a lot about life. But it was post being diagnosed with cancer that he contemplated death.Paul Kalanithi divided the book into two parts. One reflecting on his life before cancer and one on his life after. But for me, this book has three parts, the last one being his wife's epilogue. The first part filled me with awe. It was humbling to know that there are people who keep their minds constantly occupied by reflecting on their actions and thoughts throughout their daily lives. The second part filled me with pride. The honesty with which Kalanithi approached his fight with the disease makes him so dear and so approachable. Your heart goes out to him and his family but you feel pride and not sympathy. The final part was the one that broke me. The change of the POV from Paul Kalanithi to Lucy Kalanithi changes the narrative from a brave soldier who assures you everything's going to be fine before going into the war to that of his family that has to lower him into the grave or burn his ashes. I realised that the saying that cancer affects the family of the patient more than anything I've can imagine is very true. This book for me encompasses life. The beautiful thoughts of Kalanithi accompanied by his even more beautiful wiring is a blessing to this world. I was scared that I wasn't mentally prepared to start reading reading this book. But I'm so glad I did. This will remain one of my favourites for a long time to come."
288,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5246491-suzanne,Rating 5 out of 5,"The only dead person I have ever seen is my Irish grandmother. I was 13 at the time and she was in her coffin, with a rosary in her hands. I remember my brother, sister, and I being horrified when we were encouraged to kiss her corpse at the wake. Not even my Mum and aunts telling us we would get a plenary indulgence of two years off in purgatory was enough to make us comply. That's not to say that I didn't love my Grandma - she was wonderful and always up for fun. But this was my first and only time coming up close and personal with death, and I wanted to stay as far away as possible.Reading ""When Breath Becomes Air"" forces you to to confront death. To really think about what it means to face it, either your own or helping a loved one face theirs. As Paul (and you can't help but feel like you are on first-name terms with him after reading this book) writes: ""Death comes for all of us. For us, for our patients: it is our fate as living, breathing, metabolizing organisms."" It's an uncomfortable read, breathtakingly sad for the human potential that is now gone, and depressing in making you think about things you'd rather blithely ignore. At the same time, it is slightly comforting. There's almost a reassuring tone here. Paul mentions briefly that if he had been more religious, he might have been tempted to become a pastor, and he tries to weave in a pastoral element to his care of patients. That desire to nurture, help, and console comes through strongly in his writing. He talks at one point about how ""human knowledge is never contained in one person"" but the knowledge that Paul built up over his too-short lifetime is both inspiring and slightly intimidating. Not just the accumulation of degrees (of which there were many), but also how much he read. This guy loved his literature and he frequently quotes from his wide reading. He talks about searching for Truth and mentions the Biblical passage of how ""For here the saying is verified that ""One sows and another reaps."" I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the work, and you are sharing the fruits of their work."" Through Paul's writing, we get to reap the work he has done in thinking about death, and be more prepared to deal with questions and decisions when the day inevitably comes. And for that, we should all be grateful."

If I had more stars than 5, I would have given them all to this book. When Breath Becomes Air is the memoir of Paul Kalanithi, a highly intelligent neurosurgeon, who at the young age of 36 is diagnosed with terminal lungcancer. It chronicals his journey of becoming a doctor, leading up to his diagnosis, followed by his transition from doctor to patient. Paul died in 2015, before being able to finish this book, but left behind this incredible insightful, wise and eloquent piece of work. Pauls wife completed his work with a final chapter that has the rare distinction of being one of the 3 books to make adult me cry.I cannot even begin to describe what this meant to me. I borrowed this book from the library and it took me all of five seconds after I finished this, to go online and order the hardcover for full price (which my medstudent-budget can definitely not handle). Two minutes after that, I was on the phone with my dad, telling him to pleasepleaseplease read this because I want to talk to somene about this. Thát was how much this meant to me. Now, a little later, I still think of it. I have reread pages, marked the sh*t out of my own copy and have at times just wanted to hug it for comfort. I have never read a book that has personally resonated with me on so many levels. A tiny little background about me: I am a medical intern, I have survived cancer once, but due to a genetic syndrome I will most likely get cancer again... and maybe even again, until I get a form that I will not survive. I am not telling you to this be dramatic or to get sympathy. I'm telling you because it's why this had such special meaning to me, and the reason I feel I have the right to speak on this book. I have read very few books that made me go: ""this is the way I feel"". This book did that for me and I cannot thank it enough for doing that. I wish I could express to the author or his family how much this book means to me. I genuinely hope his family and his daughter are so proud of the legacy their father/brother/husband left for the world with this masterpiece. "

292,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"This book, like the author himself, remains potential unrealized. Impending death may be cause for revaluation of life and the choices made. It can be preparation for death both emotionally and philosophically. It may be celebration of time well spent. Unfortunately none of that will be found in this book.What is found is the author bearing witness to his own educational and career success. Getting a book published in his grand finale in his resume. More than half the book is spent on his curriculum vitae. From point A to B to C and so on. High school, college, masters degree, doctoral degree, residency graduation, a salary about to increase 6 fold, etc etc etc.There is precious little insight into what it is to live or what it is to die. It is surprisingly superficial and the story of a man chasing success, whatever that may be, ending in one more gold star in his report card: a book in his name."
293,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5942822-alan,Rating 4 out of 5,"Lucy Kalanithi's thoughts on today's ""death-averse culture"" is interesting to think about. To me, death holds an aversiveness that transcends the realm of culture. It is, for the better part of our lives, a deeply embedded genetic code, its manifestation apparent from the first breath of a newborn. What I loved about this book was Paul's bravery. I am not afraid to admit that death terrifies me, and lung cancer is a qualifier that magnifies its effect. Yet being able to witness an embodiment of passion and love walk towards death, ready to embrace it with open arms, was comforting. Fantastic book."

My mind is a big empty hole. Sorry if this review is a little incohesive, but I don’t think I’m able to gather my thoughts into a logical whole even if I finished reading it a few days ago. While reading ,, When Breath Becomes Air” I felt so miserable (especially during the epilogue) that I cried A LOT and almost shed all the water from my body which is about 70% of me, so you can see that's a lot. Now I'm a dried-up bunch of cells (that cannot function without water anyway), trying to describe my feelings in words that I know will never be enough. Despite me being blue, feeling that way does not seem 100 percent appropriate, because the book is filled with an infinite hope that doesn’t let you break down completely. If you asked me to describe this novel with one word, I wouldn't say ""sad"" or ""depressing"". I would say hopeful. While the content of the novel is depressing, the author's writing style does not result in overwhelming despondency. It is not heavy and haughty but full of hope.""When Breath Becomes Air"" is a beautiful story about being a prisoner of time and not letting it break your heart. I got the impression that this book is powerful and vulnerable at the same time. I think overall powerful and vulnerable may be called antonyms to some extent, but in this case, they complement each other. I feel I have to be careful of every word I write so as not to hurt this book (yes I’m well aware that ""hurt a book"" sounds ridiculous). The experience of reading this novel hit me on a very personal level by making me aware of the short-livedness of life. I started to wonder about how one’s life can change diametrically and how the changes could ruin the world that we’ve been working on since we were kids. I can’t even imagine how hard it is to adjust to the new, strange reality that now is your everydayness. A disease like cancer changes your world and your perception of life, and there is nothing we can do about it. The trick is, not to let the disease change you. Cancer makes changes on many levels of your life, but you cannot let it take away who you are, because it's as if surrendering to it. This novel has taught me that nothing really is the end of the world. Some things things are beyond our control and we have to try not to burden ourselves with them, because it’s futile and pointless. To accept changes is to deal with them and that’s the best we can do for ourselves.Paul, who is both the author and the main character of the novel, tried not to lose himself when he had to adapt to his new life from day to day. He faces many choices that most people will never have to make. There are many questions and no answers and he finds out that the only person who can give him the detailed answers is himself. The book aims to answer the question of what is the meaning of life. I found it smart that Paul was looking for the solution in literature and biology. I’ve never thought about how much these two fields depend on each other. I’ve never been really keen on biology, but now when I see that is connected to humanistic subjects that have always appealed to me, I feel a little interested in it. The story of Paul Kalanith takes your breath away and leaves you breathless with million thoughts inside your head. I recommend it to everyone."

Every day is about fighting through a few hours to finally get some shut eye in one’s own bed. By fighting I do not mean to say that everyone fights battles on all days but in our own chosen paths of life, we put together a living inch by inch on every single day. For some it is a chore, be it studies or work they are in fields where they would rather not be and for others who really seem to have found their calling (blessed are they !) each day is one step closer to realizing their dreams. Paul Kalanithi is an individual who from a young age was drawn to literature and in his own words :  Books became my closest confidants, finely ground lenses providing new views of the world. But the more he reads and studies literature, realization dawns on him that his pursuit is for something larger than just the nuances of literature and eventually this epiphany leads him to medical school. Paul works through the mountains of medical literature and the inexorably long residency process with a fine, clear and articulate mind and moves ever so closer to his dream of becoming a reputed neurosurgeon. Paul is incredibly articulate and candid about his time in residency and his learning curve is something we as readers become privy to. In the initial stages all that he looks for are finding cures or solutions, the next step being crushing despair at having come face to face with death and yet being rendered helpless, the third phase is the inevitable busy one when he really does not have much time to empathize with the patient or their relatives and the last is when he comes full circle and accepts the certitude that a doctor can and will fail. He writes :  We had assumed an onerous yoke, that of mortal responsibility. Our patients’ lives and identities may be in our hands, yet death always wins. Even if you are perfect, the world isn’t. The secret is to know that the deck is stacked, that you will lose, that your hands or judgment will slip, and yet still struggle to win for your patients. You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving.It is when he is at the cusp of finishing his residency that nature plays the cruel joke on him. The doctor who treated countless patients finally becomes the victim as Paul is diagnosed with advanced lung cancer with metastases that slowly seem to grow and engulf him with each passing day. Understandably he is devastated and so is the family and yet Paul builds his confidence back and goes into therapy. With the help of his oncologist and the support of his wife and loved ones, he slowly makes a come back to life and even brings forth a young life ( his little daughter – Caddy) into the world. The evil twin however was not done with him just yet and Paul buckles under the onslaught and eventually with dignity and grace takes his final bow.There is a poetic beauty to this book that makes it so touching and incredibly candid. As Paul’s wife mentions in the afterword, the narrative races against time for Paul knew there wasn’t a lot of it left. The language he writes in is strong and empathetic and betrays not much emotion of the soul crushing despair that he goes through. Even when his dreams crumble to dust, Paul remains lucid enough to take us through the exhaustion he feels with a clinical detachment. He would have made such a wonderful writer but alas nature is not known to be much merciful !Strongly recommended. To me this was one of the best books I have read and this goes right into the pile of my favorites.If I may quote just one more bit from the book :  Everyone succumbs to finitude. I suspect I am not the only one who reaches this pluperfect state. Most ambitions are either achieved or abandoned; either way, they belong to the past. The future, instead of the ladder toward the goals of life, flattens out into a perpetual present. Money, status, all the vanities the preacher of Ecclesiastes described hold so little interest: a chasing after wind, indeed."

Memoirs aren't something that I usually gravitate to, but the synopsis of When Breath Becomes Air really struck a chord with me. I'm so glad I read it because it was such a wonderful book. Paul Kalanithi was a remarkable doctor and human being.Paul was diagnosed with stage-four lung cancer at the young age of 36. At the time he was diagnosed, he was in the last year of his residency and on the cusp of starting the life he and his wife Lucy had always dreamed. Unfortunately, his dream of becoming a neurosurgeon scientist went unfulfilled and his life was cut short.Dying in one's fourth decade is unusual now, but dying is not. ""The thing about lung cancer is that it's not exotic,"" Paul wrote in an email to his best friend, Robin. ""The reader can get into these shoes, walk a bit, and say, 'So that's what it looks like from here. Sooner or later, I'll be back here in my own shoes.'  That's what I'm aiming for, I think. Not the sensationalism of dying and not the exhortations to gather rosebuds but: Here's what lies up ahead on the road."" Of course, he did more than just describe the terrain. He traversed it bravely.— From the epilogue written by Paul's widow, Lucy.This book chronicles his life and his unyielding search for the answer to the question: What makes life worth living? It's a question that I think everyone has pondered in some capacity in their lives. Paul's thoughts on the subject are introspective, deeply personal, and poetic. His writing has a sort of grace and depth that leaves an impression on you.What I really liked about this book was Paul. I felt like I got to know him through this story. The way he approached his practice of medicine to way he maintained close contact to his friends demonstrated what a kind-hearted and remarkable person he was.When Breath Becomes Air isn't what you think of when you think of a cancer memoir. He doesn't go into excruciating detail about the numerous treatments he had to endure or the pain—not that those things are bad. But for me, it was unexpected that he spoke more on life than death. His faced mortality with a sense of courageousness and vulnerability that was so profoundly honest.I finished this memoir with tears in my eyes, reading his wife's figurative period at the end of Paul's unfinished sentence. She talked about Paul's final months. Months spent playing with their daughter and typing away on this book—the book that he didn't get to finish.
When Breath Becomes Air is, in a sense, unfinished, derailed by Paul's rapid decline. But that is an essential component of its truth. Of the reality Paul faced.
This book is short, but I wouldn't rush to call it a ""quick read."" While it is not long, its pages are concentrated with a deeply philosophical and personal message. I can't wait to read it again.* I received this audiobook from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

312,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6326169-negin,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book has fabulous reviews and it seems that everyone and their mother has been going on about it. I thought that I would love it for sure. For me, it was just okay and nothing to write home about. A book that is similar with regards to subject matter, but that is far better than this one is Life’s That Way. That book is one of my favorites of all time. "
313,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus,Rating 4 out of 5,"I had fully been expecting Paul Kalanithi's When Breath Becomes Air -- in which a 36-year-old neurosurgeon writes a memoir about his own upcoming death by cancer -- to be a weepy tearjerker; so it's a testament to Kalanithi's writing skills that it's instead a clear-eyed, thought-provoking intellectual treatise about mortality and why humans react to the subject in the ways they do. Then again, it helps that Kalanithi actually acquired degrees in literature and philosophy before going to med school, and in fact only turned to medicine in the first place in a roundabout way; always fascinated by the human mind and in the ways humans interact with each other, he first spent his twenties delving into the arts to find answers to these subjects, only to realize that the true way to satisfy his curiosity was to directly study the biochemistry of the brain itself, putting himself through a grueling ten-year training ordeal that nearly ended his marriage, just to finally graduate and promptly be informed that he had a year left to live.Unfortunately, though, the book isn't very good for the purpose it had been originally been recommended to me; for like most middle-aged children of elderly parents in declining health, I find myself wrestling these days with Big Questions about the end of life, the quality of that life at the end of it, and what the proper way is for both the people at the end of that life and the people around them to react to such developments, and had hoped that this book might shine some light on these weighty issues. Kalanithi's main conclusion about it all, though, is basically, ""Impending death is an inherently confusing, horrifying and baffling thing, and I reacted to it with pretty much all the chaos that everyone else does too...although it did help a little bit to start believing in God again."" (Also, be aware that the last 25 pages of this 225-page book are written by Kalanithi's wife after his death, sort of summing up what happened once he got too sick to write; and she's a much worse writer, one who regularly wallows in sentimentality like a 22-year-old suburbanite bathing in cheap cologne before a night at the clubs, making a substantial amount of this book's total page count easily skippable altogether.)The reason to read this, then, is as a primer on how to handle impending death with a kind of grace, dignity and thoughtfulness that's rarely seen in people about to die, obviously the main reason the book's become so popular in the year now it's been out; but don't pick it up expecting any kinds of insights on mortality, because Kalanithi has none to give, which obviously is itself a telling statement about whether there actually are any kinds of insights about mortality to share in the first place, but you don't need to read the whole book simply to know that the answer here is ""no."" But that being said, it's still a really well-done memoir, one that deliberately skips all the easy beats that usually come with this subject in order to deliver something much more intelligent and honest. It comes recommended in that particular spirit. "
314,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2118933-leo-walsh,Rating 2 out of 5,"I disliked the narrative voice of Paul Kalanithi, whose memoir, When Breath Becomes Air topped many “Best of 2016” lists. To some, this will make me seem cold, unable to empathize with a young father dying of cancer. And grappling with the complex, deeply human concern of mortality. But my objections are stylistic. Instead of a real person facing death, Kalanithi writes like a Nabokov-style hothouse flower, replete with literary name-drops and maudlin “flashes of insight” that made me cringe. Like Nabokov, Kalanithi was a child of privilege. His parents were physicians, and worked to increase his SAT scores with the goal of getting him into the Ivy League. His mother had him reading from the “great books list” at a time in life when most normal kids are playing baseball, soccer and skinning their knees. Due to this grooming, Kalanithi received a Masters in literature from Harvard, and then spent a year at Oxford before taking more classes and entering Stanford’s medical school. Not typical. Granted, we need more education-obsessed parents. I laud the focus. It’s good parenting. But I object to Kalathini’s self-absorption. He was born on third and yet, even while dying, congratulates himself for hitting a triple. In his telling, he’s the BEST doctor, filled with an “empathic” attachment to his patients, devastated by his failures. He tells of his skill with a scalpel in his chosen field of neurosurgery. But his recounting focuses not pride in workmanship, but on him informing readers how great HE was. Not the work, but him. This “I’m great… and probably better than you” attitude left me cold.Even terminal cancer couldn’t knock him down a peg. For instance, after decades of being an atheist, he returns to his Christian church, but disses fundamentalist Christians. Odd thing is, I also dislike literalist evangelicals. But Kalanithi’s hubris, as left my jaw dragging the floor. Instead of focusing on the good people of his church, he focuses on himself. He identified as “Christian,” but not one of those “dirty, unwashed regular Christians.” The narrative self-aggrandizement conspired to blunt the impact of When Breath becomes Air for me. Shocking, because I like books that plumb the moral, spiritual and scientific depths Kalanithi explores. I imagine this speaks more to a human lack within me than Kalanithi, but my disdain for his narrative voice overrode my love of the ideas. That said, I felt sorry for his wife. Her emotional closing chapter was the best of the book. It smacked of honest grief. And because she was not trying to write a “literary memoir,” her simple, direct prose worked. At first, I added a star for this chapter, but retracted it when realizing it was an “afterthought,” the would not exist without Kalanithi’s memoir. Two stars. "

Turned out I am an INTP so the book that was suggested to me is this book. Naturally I have to read it and made it a goal to read this in March as part of my birthday celebrationI was blindly getting it without any knowledge what the book is all about. I have no idea that it is a memoir of Paul, the author. I truthfully thought that this was another general fiction. It's a good thing that I didn't know otherwise I might have lost interest because it's a nonfiction (not really a fan) and missed reading this heartwarming/wrenching storyLike I said, it's a memoir of Paul Kalanithi, the author who was a neurosurgeon who then became a patient because of lung cancer but the story beautifully started when he was 6-8 years old, growing up in Arizona and was forced to read all the classics by his mother as preparation for college. Thanks to this he developed a love for reading and wanted to be a writer at some point of his lifeThen an event triggered his curiosity about life and what's the meaning of it. This led him to take up biology and the rest is historyWhen he found out that he has cancer, he was in his last year of residency. He would have been one of the best and was heavily sought after by hospitals and what not. It was sad that the future he has been striving for was taken from him but he was always optimistic. He knew he might die so he and his wife do all they can to make their life meaningful including having a babyCady was born when he has started his chemotherapy which wasn't working well for him. Eight months later the cancer has spread into his brain and his health deteriorated which led to his deathHe died last year on my birthday. I was crying like mad the whole time I read it. There were lots of tissues involved. I just can't help it because it can happen to anyone, including me, who coincidentally has a lot of health complications of my own. So yeah it hits close to homeI admire him for writing this book despite the pain that he has to endure to write it.Perhaps I might enjoy this book more if I understand all the medical terms that he was using. Other than that it was a great perspective to see the struggle of cancer patient, and a little reminder for me just to enjoy and make my life as meaningful as I canStory 5/5Character 5/5Development 5/5Enjoyment 4/5Style of writing 5/5Overall 4.8/5"
316,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58035793-hiba,Rating 5 out of 5,"I have discussed career options time and over with my mother, always telling her how much I loved the field of medicine, surgery in particular, but how I'd never want to be one, because I didn't trust myself with people's lives, and if I had had a chance earlier, I wouldn't have chosen the field because of how much responsibility came with it and how frail I was in front of it. And this results in how much I appreciate people who have real passion and devotion for this field of work. I was not expecting to love this book as much as I did, partly because tales about people with cancer often describe only how brave the patient was, how strong, and in what spirits they 'fought' the disease, never once stopping to ponder over the fact that the disease was the person itself, so who were they fighting? Their own rebellious cells. Paul's way of counting what he had gone through was soothing in a way, he didn't linger much on anything in particular, he was just re-telling the truth of what he was, and what he had gone through. In a way that I couldn't stop reading, because of how calm it made me feel, even though it engraved on my heart a deep feeling of sadness in the process.The epilogue was probably the hardest part for me to go through, because it was no longer Paul's steady and calm writing, it wasn't his part of the story, where he assessed his cancer rationally and acted practically, it was his wife's, an outsider's POV, and it was painful to read. Because, we sometimes forget what the family members have to go through, we forget about their 'bravery' and patience and that they have to lose part of them, a part that's already used to the idea of dying. Lucy's pages were more raw with emotions in a way, and I had to read it in small intervals to stop myself from crying.It was not just a book to tell us readers that death is inevitable and that we should accept the idea of it or at least try to, it was a lot more. Perhaps more of taking us on a trip of acceptance, slowly integrating us in the feeling of it."
317,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109794023-kiran-dellimore,Rating 4 out of 5,"Writing for some people is like breathing air. It is so natural, that they just do it with consummate ease. Paul Kalathani's memoir, When Breath Becomes Air, embodies this spirit well. His swan song opus tells the heart-wrenching tale of his fateful battle with lung cancer. It is an honest, at times unflattering (sometimes he comes across as an arrogant know-it-all doctor who refuses to accept that he is a cancer patient) account of his head-on confrontation with death and the ultimate crushing acceptance of the limits of his own mortality. What is most striking is his noble attempt to die on his own terms in the face of the uncertainty about when his time would finally come. It is quite telling that Paul's big dream was to finish his autobiography before he passed away. He invested an untold amount of his limited reservoirs of energy in the last months of his life pursuing this goal. It is clear from this sacrifice that Paul had a burning sense of urgency to impart to others the lessons he had learned about meaningfulness in life from his own abbreviated existence. Yet he stops short of offering trite, overly distilled gems of wisdom about the secrets of life divined by death's sudden, unyielding encroachment. When Breath Becomes Air reveals in many ways Paul's bewildering disbelief and tormented struggle to comprehend his fate. In this way it is a very human story that speaks to everyone. My favorite part of this memoir is in fact the epilogue, which was absolutely beautifully written, by Paul's wife Lucy. The epilogue conveys the emotional weight, distressing loss and deep love that she experienced, with immaculate grace and dignity, as Paul's life came to end. When Breath Becomes Air is an inspiring memoir that I recommend unreservedly to anyone who seeks to appreciate the fragility and transience of human existence."
318,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1253673-diane-yannick,Rating 5 out of 5,"This memoir was pretty darn amazing. Thanks to his background in literature and philosophy, Paul Kalanithi brings a unique perspective to the practice of medicine. ""Before operating on a patient's brain, I realized I must first understand his mind: his identity, his values, what makes his life worth living and what devastation makes it reasonable to let that life end."" His sensitivity to his patients' medical AND emotional needs, earned him deserved respect.He knew immediately when he looked at his own lung X-rays that he would need to learn how to die. He had to quickly decide what his priorities were. He had to accept the sacrifices and delayed gratification he'd endured in order to become a neurosurgeon. I, for one, am glad that he used his last months to write this book. He writes beautifully despite some pretty awful chemo side effects that made using a computer difficult. He wrestled until the very end with questions such as, ""Where does biology, morality, literature and philosophy intersect?"" He tried to figure out what makes human life meaningful even when faced with death. Then he set out to live a meaningful life until his last breath. (BTW, isn't the title just perfect?)I believe this book will be a priceless gift for his daughter Cady who was only 8 months old when he died at age 37. Toward the end of his book he addresses her, ""You filled a dying man's days with sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years; a joy that does not hunger for more and more but rests, satisfied."" His acceptance of his death and wisdom left me deep in thought. This is not a book you will read and quickly forget."

I know this is a biography; however, I never expected to read so much intricacies of details so intimately and beautifully written as this was.This was a personal account of an individual and his experiences with the medical field as both a doctor and a patient. I was in tears all throughout; and I wished that he would be alive writing books with this same beautiful style. The book shook my insides, knowing that I love the field of medicine myself. Paul's hardships were extremely touching to me while reading. When he became a lung cancer victim, he knew and expected things medically and was always striving, fighting, and thirsty for knowledge. His unconditional strength broke me as I read; I thought to myself I want to strive to be like Paul incessantly. As a doctor, patient, and father, who is a neurosurgeon and scientist, his capacity and will for doing things was astoundingly amazing.Cancer is generally a person's setback out of every way to live life normally. I never expected such a small book to carry so much value as to personal strength, motivation, time and stress management. This is such a beautiful piece about someone's life, who took death expectantly. Paul read about death, talked about death, and researched it through philosophical and classical readings.I can't speak enough of the beauty of the writing as personal as it was. The book was such a smooth experience of perfect biographical writing. Simply amazing!!"

This is his memoir. Kalanithi certainly writes eloquently about his experiences, both as a physician, dealing with some heart-breaking cases, and as a patient facing his own devastating diagnosis. The forward by Abraham Verghesse gives some additional insight, and an afterward by Paul’s wife finishes the story of how this came to be published. I was interested and moved by his story. It’s a good book… perhaps even a great book. I’m glad he and his wife shared this story with the world, but perhaps my expectations were too high, given all the accolades and the number of people telling me I MUST read this book. It just didn’t rise to the 5-star level for me. The audiobook is narrated primarily by Sunil Malhotra (for the forward and the memoir written by Kalanithi himself), and Cassandra Campbell (reading Lily’s afterward). Very well done audio. "

What I mean by that is that it's a quick, insightful and well laid out documentation of Cancer and neurology. The author was a neurologist when he discovered he had terminal cancer, and one of the things which he wanted to do before his death was to write a book which is this one. He was clearly a very well rounded and skilled person, but also someone who had a lot to battle with in the last years of his life so the fact that he decided to also write this is pretty impressive. I will say the story isn't 'happy' per se, as it's real life and the author didn't get to finish the book in the way he may have wanted. I did like seeing his wife's afterword, and I think there's a lot to take away from a book like this even if you're lucky enough not to have been affected much by cancer. 4*s and a great nonfiction."

""Words have a longevity I do not.""
I cried. I'm unafraid to type that. This touching I-am-about-to-die nonfictional journey written by Paul Kalanithi is incredible. Must admit I was doing pretty well with holding it all together, but when he started talking directly to his infant daughter at the end, I got emotional and reflective about everything life-centric. When Breath Becomes Air just does something to you—something inexplicably deep and freeing—if you have the heart to allow it in. Even though we'll never know when we're to go, expect death...and make sure you embrace days more than a jar does mayonnaise."
