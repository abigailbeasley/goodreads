0,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa,Rating 2 out of 5,"Let me preface this review by saying that I know this a disproportionately emotional review, but it's my review and my emotions and it is what it is.In 1996, the home of the Japanese ambassador to Peru was taken hostage by guerillas during a party and held for 126 days until the home was raided by military force killing all the insurgents, many executed after they surrendered. At a time when Peru suffered an undercurrent of terrorist activity, president Fujimori was praised for his handling of the crisis and his approval rating soared. Since then, the commanders in the Peruvian army have been on trial for homicide but granted amnesty because they were praised as national heros. President Fujimori himself is in prison for human rights violations, not from this incidence, but still an interesting side note since those loss of rights are linked to his low tolerance for terrorist activity. A very interesting story that happened in Peru, a country with a name and a history more interesting than opera, but this I'm afraid was not that story.It upset me to realize that Patchett was using a piece of Peruvian history with no intention of telling a story of Peru or its political unrest or even including a proper description of the country. She only refers to ""the host country"" or ""this godforsaken country"" in a vague brush of one of those South American countries that aren't very important or distinct. Did she neglect to put Peru in the story because it defames the country or really is it that they just aren't interesting enough to her? I know I shouldn't be offended that she dedicated this whole book to an opera singer who wasn't even part of the crisis and even gave it an Italian name, but a little bit I am. Even the ""about the book"" section is dedicated all to loving opera without a mention to the actual crisis that inspired the events.There is a passage in the book about Roxane, the opera singer, singing a Czech piece and Gen, the translator, notes the distinction between knowing the words and speaking the language and only someone who spoke the language would see the lack of understanding. Maybe my reading this book was a little like that. I felt like I was reading two books simultaneously. The one about opera with vague, inaccurate concepts of an unnamed Peru where, if I had let Patchett guide my visual picture of the book I would have imagined the Von Trapp house stuck in the middle of the Amazon jungle. And the other of what I know about Peru and the crisis situation, trying to meld that visual to this story.I realize that this is a piece of fiction and Patchett has the artistic license to write a fictional description of the crisis anyway she wishes, but I didn't like the story she chose to tell. A hostage situation is intense, but even the takeover she stretches through wanderings of the love of opera and manages to dull it so that not even the hostages seem anything other than mildly putout. Maybe it's because I'm not a opera lover (there are opera pieces I enjoy, but as a whole it's not something I seek out), but I found it unbelievable that all these people (most of them men) would be so mesmerized by an opera singer and all of them fall in love with her and her music. I felt as though Patchett was using this story as a vehicle to force me to love opera and me on the other side of the pages resists for nothing more than the force of her request.It took me over 200 pages to get into this 300-page story and the only thing that eventually drew me in and saved it was the relationships between the hostages and their captors. In a normal setting I may not have believed it, but I did of the generally humble Peruvians, which is why the country should have been vital to the story. It took Patchett awhile to get there, but eventually I did like the characters. Even though I knew how it would end, I was anxious for the conclusion, to avoid inevitable tragedy. I could have done without the epilogue that was unnecessary and cheap. If Patchett wanted to include an epilogue, maybe she should have included one about the actual events. Or maybe it's all too appropriate that Peru was ignored. Okay, I'm done with my Peruvian inferiority complex over here. Feel free to talk about the actual story in your review or in the comments section.1.5 stars, somewhere between a book prevented from being a great story and a book that upset me according to my own star ratings. I did find some merit in the book by the end, but it wasn't enough to overcome Patchett's inability to research her setting."
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/307208-lucy,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book came highly recommended, and once I started reading, I kept thinking I had already but couldn't, for the life of me, remember how it ended. Turns out, it only seemed familiar to me because it is based on a real life experience. In 1995, the president of Peru and many of his guests were taken hostage and held for months. Bel Canto is a fictitious story based loosely on those events.I only liked Bel Canto. I understand its appeal - the coming together of hostages and terrorists alike, but the writing was a bit too ethereal and romantic for me. SO much emphasis placed on opera, as if it's the universal band-aid. I know a lot of people that don't enjoy opera at all. In fact, a music lover myself, I'd have to admit that most of opera is an acquired taste. The hugeness of the voice, the strong vibrato and foreign languages take some getting used to. However, according to the author, there is no politician, businessman, servant or gunman that doesn't fall into a deep state of hypnosis when a soprano begins her song. I tend to think that perhaps the terrorist from a South American country, where musical tastes are a bit different, might not have been so cast under her spell, but I could be wrong. I've never thought of it as the only offered solace to a terrifying situation.Which leads me to the other thing that I find a hard time believing. Terrorists...with guns....coming through air vents into a vice presidential palace and no one seems particularly petrified throughout it all. Again, I think this was the author's way of romanticizing the event by leaving out the crapping of pants and desperate pleas for loved ones, but everyone was annoyingly contrite and calm, even the terrorists themselves, who seemed awfully nice and understanding. The end was appropriately tragic. I read a few reviews that described this as an example of magical realism, a genre I try and avoid so this labeling surprised me. Maybe all the lack of fear, suspended time and happy hostage household was part of it. The ending, while sad and tragic, satisfied my need for logic and realism. This event seemed to have a larger psychological effect on the survivors then the original hostage takeover. Whether or not that is realistic or not, I have no idea.I wish she hadn't written her epilogue. It was unnecessary and unbelievable. Sort of like how all doctors on a hospital television show end up as couples, as if there were no one else in the world to date or socialize with. I did not believe or think that Gen and Roxane belonged together...even with their personal losses.The book as a whole, however, is not void of greatness. The Russian cabinet member and his story of the box was poetic. Cesar's natural talent and love of performing made me cheer. And the inward look at most regarding their professions and priorities was very appropriate. All combined, it makes for an enjoyable, flawed book."
2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian,Rating 5 out of 5,"Holy crap! This ""1-Dayer"" deserves applause & praise indeed as it will surely stay with you like some truly terrific (& best yet, catchy) song for days, for weeks to come.What happens when terrorists take over a party held in honor of a Japanese businessman at the house of the Vice President of some unknown South American city? A translator is thankfully employed, a Diva is made to sing like a modern Scheherazade. Renaissance flourishes as these individuals in the most insane of circumstances come together to realize the true WORTH of people and the VALUE of themselves. This is what all those characters in Boccaccio did... ! (& anyone reaching the very heights reached by Boccaccio must MUST be extolled!)This Stockholm Syndrome is comical, sad, romantic. It's written with a less amount of elegance than the cover promises--but that is hardly ever a fault in this book, ripe & so ready to be inscribed into the canon."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17295672-jaidee,Rating 1 out of 5,"1.5 ""overwrought, stereotypical, ridiculous"" stars !! 2015 Most Disappointing Read Award (tie) Of all the books on my reading list, ""Bel Canto"" was one that I was most looking forward to. You see after my faith and my loved ones the thing I most adore is Opera. Opera has been my passion, my solace, my escape and the most direct connection to my emotional life. I have found Opera beautiful, profound, wise and affirming. I was introduced to Opera at the age of 10 and since then there has not been a day where I have not listened to it. I remember traveling through Colombian jungle (with some friends) at the age of twenty four and ran out of batteries for my discman. I was working through some obscure Russian opera at the time. My mood plummeted so severely that one of my friends took out her AA batteries from her mini-flashlight. (now that's a good friend)so that I could listen at night until we reached the next village.I read ""The Patron Saint of Liars"" by Patchett in 2013 and thought it was a very good book (3.5 stars) full of psychological insight and an understanding of what disconnection does to family relationships. I was expecting this book to be even better as it won awards, was a later novel and for God's sake was about Opera.From the get go I felt my heart sink and chapter after chapter I read in disbelief that this was the same book that others gave such accolades. The book rang so false to my ear. The melodrama and overly disgustingly sweet sentimentality was jarring, discomforting and infuriating.I somehow suspected that Ann Patchett had subcontracted a junior writer from Disney Animation and another burned out writer from Harlequin Romance to come together and churn this out while she joined their ideas and linked them with a very few gorgeous passages. The characters were absolute caricatures with extreme gender and ethnic stereotypes. The emotions and story line were completely illogical and the whole experience left me both angry and depleted.The only thing that will act as salve to cure my disappointment is to go and listen to Diana Damrau sing some heavy Richard Strauss songs with orchestra. Thank goodness for that.Addendum: My partner just noted that I rated Veronica Wants to Die by Paulo Coelho higher than this. This is getting scary."
4,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bel Canto, Ann PatchettBel Canto is the fourth novel by American author Ann Patchett, published in 2001 by Perennial, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. It was also adapted into an opera in 2015. Based on the Japanese embassy hostage crisis (also called the Lima Crisis) of 1996–1997 in Lima, Peru, the novel follows the relationships among a group of young terrorists and their hostages, who are mostly high-profile executives and politicians, over several months. Many of the characters form unbreakable bonds of friendship, while some fall in love. Set in an unspecified South American country, the story begins at a birthday party thrown at the country's vice presidential home in honor of Katsumi Hosokawa, the visiting chairman of a large Japanese company and opera enthusiast. تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوم ماه ژانویه سال 2017میلادیعنوان: بل کانتو؛ نویسنده: آن پچت؛ مترجم: محمد عباس آبادی؛ تهران، افراز، 1395؛ در 373ص؛ شابک 9786003261853؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21مجشن تولدی در خانه‌ ی معاون رئیس‌ جمهور یکی از کشورهای «آمریکای لاتین» برپاست؛ مهمان‌ها از سراسر دنیا آمده‌ اند، و در میان آن‌ها یک خواننده‌ ی سوپرانو؛ و میلیاردری «ژاپنی» حضور دارند؛ همه‌ چیز خوب پیش می‌رود، تا اینکه گروهی تروریست وارد خانه می‌شوند؛ هدف آن‌ها رئیس‌ جمهور است، امّا او در این جشن حضور ندارد؛ اکنون دیگر راه بازگشتی؛ نه برای مهمانان، و نه برای تروریست‌ها نیست؛ آنچه باقی می‌ماند کلنجار با موقعیتی مهیب، احساسات عاشقانه، و روابطی انسانی است، که سیاست و اپرا و عشق را به هم گره می‌زندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 07/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 22/07/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie,Rating 1 out of 5,"How could a wanna-read-bad TBR turn into a sorry-ass DNF?WTF? DNF! OMG!WTF?Who AM I? I finish every book I start, yet I did not finish this one! And I LOVE Ann Patchett! Her State of Wonder is one of my all-time favorite books! What the fuck is going on?DNF!I’m having a serious crisis here. Have I thought this out carefully? Can I really pull off abandoning this book? I must do it. Calm down. It’s okay. Listen to your friends who whisper, “It’s fine….let go…” A zillion other books are beckoning. Yes, life is too short to keep reading something you hate. If I repeat that last sentence enough times, I’ll start believing it, right? OMG!Oh my god, I did it! I DNF’d it, and I didn’t die! (A weird feeling still remains, however.)I’m so speechless about throwing this book out the window that I’ve resorted to acronyms to express myself, blurting out clumps of capital letters and exclamation points. Usually I rely on strong verbs and a chain of touchy adjectives, but here, no. I just have unpronounceable cap combos. Now that’s bad.Let’s start with the fact that yes, I’ve been dying to read this. The title, however, shooed me away for a long while; I hate opera and all its bel-canto-ness. Then a friend assured me that it wasn’t about opera, that it was about a terrorist attack with a bunch of hostages. So I ignored my title hatred and rubbed my hands in glee. Who doesn’t like a good hostage story, as long as it’s in the hands of a pro? And I knew Patchett’s a pro. I don’t know how she did it, but Patchett managed to make a terrorist attack boring. I didn’t get a sense of mad confusion or terror; it all seemed muted and sort of civilized. And eventually, many of the terrorists become nice guys. I know she wanted to show their humanity but she went overboard.And my biggest complaint is that she told us immediately who wins in the end. Completely ruined it for me! The fun is in wondering how it turns out. I don’t know what she was thinking, seriously.I don’t like opera, as I’ve said. Surely there would have been at least a few hostages and terrorists who didn’t like it either. But no, every single person seemed to be transported to la-la land when the little songbird opened her mouth. If it were me lying on the floor, surrounded by armed terrorists, I would be bemoaning not only my questionable fate, but also the fact that I was stuck in a room listening to non-stop eardrum-shattering high-pitched screeching. Just my luck, I’d be thinking. It would disrupt any calming thoughts I was working on, it would take away any chance I had of internal peace. I’d be begging the terrorists for ear plugs.The characters were lifeless and boring and I didn’t care an iota about any of them, much in the same way I don’t give a shit about cardboard. The only thing I liked was imagining a whole group of people lying face up and motionless on the floor, having conversations while looking at the ceiling. This unique scenario seemed trippy, and I loved thinking about horizontal chit-chat.Somehow Patchett managed to take the tense out of terrorism, no easy feat! It was pure torture to pick this book up, and I only made it halfway through. I wanted so much to love this book, and god knows I didn’t want to abandon it. I wanted the reality to be different. I didn’t want my love of Ann Patchett tainted. Because now whenever I think of the sweet State of Wonder, I’ll also think of the sour Bel Canto. Very sad. Of course Patchett is a skilled writer. The language is eloquent and there is some insight. But seriously, I just didn’t give a damn."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-canadian-jen,Rating 4 out of 5,"How did Patchett do this? A seemingly horrifying event turned into a mystical one. Where lines of good vs evil are blurred. Where time is suspended.It's a birthday party gala in South America. The guest of honour, a powerful Japanese figurehead, almost didn't make it himself except for the soprano whose voice he adores. As the final note is sung, the lights go out and the guerrillas enter. The party is hijacked for political reasons but what transpires during the next few months are the unusual relationships that are forged by the beauty of a voice which unites both terrorists and hostages. Where for long moments during this siege, captivity is interrupted and they are a group of people witnessing a main attraction, living it day to day.Patchett is an artist. She details a portrait in which I bear witness. I searched arias and operas to get a sense of the beauty and passion this music can evoke. I'm in awe and for that I'm rating it a 4⭐️. I am smitten now with you, Patchett, but, I reserve the final star for the ending I wasn't as smitten with."
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/784513-danielle,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is one of my top five favorite books. Bel Canto made me a devoted Patchett fan, although her other work hasn't quite stood up to the high expectations this one set for her. Just to set the scene, I read this book while on a three week trip through Europe. Travelling by train, I had plenty of time to read, but missed a lot of the beautiful countryside (especially of France and Switzerland) because I simply couldn't tear myself away from this book, it was that good. My husband woke up on the train at one point (the ending of the book) to my sobs. I was so overcome I couldn't even tell him what was the matter (he was really worried for a minute there...then he thought I was crazy). I should clarify that I'm not an especially emotional person. I had just formed such a strong attachment to the characters in this book that the ending hit me almost as hard as losing a friend. Plus, it was just so beautifully done that the loss was almost bittersweet. This book gave me so much to think about that I wanted to grab someone--anyone!--who had read this book and talk it all out with them. Well, that was almost two years ago, so my furor has died down. I need to read it again to write a fair review.For the time being, though, first I loved the writing. I admire any author who can tell a great story with the words ushering me along rather than tripping me up. Another reviewer referred to the book as ""lyrical"" and I heartily agree. It was just beautifully done. Second, such richly imagined characters were a delight to spend time with. I thought each character was fully developed and interesting. Even the minor characters, about whom I received limited information, still felt real. And I got the sense that there was so much more to know about them lurking just below the surface. Finally, the story was heartbreakingly beautiful. As my waterworks attest, it was very moving, without feeling like my emotions were being made sport of. In the ending, it all just came together for me. ""Bel Canto"" referring to the beautiful song that was the idyllic life of the hostages and captives. But just like the opera singer's song had to end eventually, their peaceful suspension from reality could not endure. To me, what made the story and the illusion so poignant was the knowledge they had all along that it WOULD end. An audience can't fool itself into thinking a performance will last indefinitely, but perhaps the awareness of the end in sight makes the beauty of the moment all the more valuable. That reference made this story even more meaningful to me. I just loved it.I gave this book five stars, but it wasn't absolutely perfect. I actually strongly disliked the epilogue. I found it disheartening, somewhat contrived, and generally unecessary. The story would have been better off without it. In spite of that, this book is everything a great book should be.UPDATE: Reread in August 2009. I still loved it, and enjoyed the writing, but it wasn't the same experience it was the first time. I wasn't as impressed, as moved, or as eager to share this book with others as I was the first time around. It must have just been the way it hit me at that time in my life. Even without it being the earth-shatteringly awesome book I felt it was before, I still highly recommend it. "
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane,Rating 5 out of 5,"To me, this book is luminous. Glorious. Magnificent. Perfect. (Well, almost perfect. I'll explain in a moment.)I first read ""Bel Canto"" in 2005, and I was so absorbed in the story that I would sneak away from my desk at work just to have a few precious moments with it. The story opens with a renowned opera singer, Roxanne Coss, giving a private performance at the home of a vice president of an unnamed South American country. Several people in the room are already in love with her, and others will fall in love with the sound of her voice.The moment she's done singing, the room is stormed by guerrilla fighters, and everyone in the home is taken hostage. What follows is a fascinating look at what happens when a group of strangers are forced to live together for weeks. The fighters make demands, a poor Red Cross volunteer acts as intermediary with officers outside, and meanwhile, everyone inside the house tries to get along, despite numerous language barriers. Which brings me to one of my favorite characters, the translator Gen. Without Gen, the entire story could not have happened, because he was the one who helped people communicate. Gen is constantly in demand, translating from English to Spanish to Russian to Japanese and back to English again.There are some surprising and emotional attachments that form -- even Gen falls in love! -- and by the end of the book, I was in tears. My only complaint is with the ending, which I won't spoil, but to say I was devastated is an understatement. But given the scenario, you can't really expect a happy ending, can you?The characters are beautifully drawn, Ann Patchett's writing is gorgeous, and some of the scenes are so vivid that it would make a wonderful film. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone who loves literary fiction. Brava!"
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36859595-nishat,Rating 5 out of 5,"Men of great importance were held hostage with a soprano. Until they realized how trivial their existences have been to the world and the world's to them. Men of different countries, men of different taste and language shut their eyes to the same beauty. Terrorists with gun earned sympathy worshipping that beauty only. A priest found his God next to him.Bel Canto embodies art itself. The book celebrates the love for what is beyond and what is incomparably greater. Our deaths don't define us, neither our birth places. It is always the things we seek. And Ben Canto beautifully explores that. I wanted to write a book that would be like an opera in its structure, its grandeur, its musicality, its melodrama.Anne Patchette's carefully woven tale moves from one being to another within a room. And for a confined story such as this, she gives life to a soaring voice. Drawing no line for herself, the abundance of well crafted words and flow of noble emotions in this savage plot, can get overwhelmingly on one's nerves which may as well explain the mixed reaction.In Bel Canto best human qualities blossom and present the philosophical problem that comes with the idea of every ideal society. With all the contradictions coming from a single room, there's no doubt the room wouldn't stand when the time comes. "
10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have read a few of this author's books now and I know what to expect. Perfect prose, well defined characters, a slow rambling story like a stroll in a beautiful park. And more often than not a difficult ending.Bel Canto demonstrates all of those characteristics. Reading it was a real pleasure and the author did not put a foot wrong literary wise. All of the characters are well defined and by the end they become people you know and some like Gen you really want to meet. Then there is the ending. Just for once I thought the author was going to get it right. It was traumatic yet expected and almost a relief when it arrived. Then she added an epilogue which was most definitely not required. It was just wrong. I can vaguely see what she was aiming for but it was still wrong.Four stars for a beautiful book which would have been five if I could just mentally unsee that epilogue!"

12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51395417-brian,Rating 4 out of 5,"“To think that God heard his name from so many voices.” (4.5 stars)The ending of “Bel Canto” left me in a bit of a daze for a few minutes. The novel cast a spell so strong, that when the jarring reality of life springs up at the conclusion you can’t help but be a little disoriented. This is a novel that has been on my radar for years, but I am just now picking it up. This story, told by an omniscient narrator, follows a hostage situation in the vice presidential palace of an unnamed South American country. The hostages include a world famous opera soprano, and many business and political leaders from various countries. The point of view also considers the guerrillas who take the hostages. I have never read an Ann Patchett novel before. I will pick her up again! She has a simplicity and lovely finesse with language. I was caught up in the story, but also in the words she used to weave it. With a precise prose that brimmed with clarity Patchett created characters that, even if only a few lines of the text were devoted to them, came across as real people. I feel like opera gets a lot of negative attention from readers of this text. And opera is important to many of the characters in the book. However, I feel the bigger point is what opera represents to many of the characters in the text. It is a source of life and inspiration. Something that gives joy and generates much power and strong feelings. That is something different for every person alive, and when you realize that you put opera in its proper context in this book, and you can place the love that characters feel for that art in its proper context, and thus appreciate it, and its potency as used in “Bel Canto”.So many enchanting moments in this book. So many small pleasures. I loved the world it created. I loved the people in that world. So many characters whose small joys I felt as my own. I loved their truth, their pain, and humanity.“Bel Canto” is something else!"
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149694522-karen,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was another one of our favorite authors with our Library Book Discussion group. I am now bringing my review to Goodreads. Did you know that this book was actually based on a true story? Set in South America, readers find themselves in a large room filled with mostly affluent bureaucrats and CEO’s that are suddenly taken hostage by terrorists during a beautiful soprano opera performance by the book’s female lead, Roxanne Coss. The story remains in that same setting, and the hostages are held captive for over 4 months. So what was intended to be just hours, turned into days and then months of standoff. And... Patchett shows readers exactly how universal humanity is... Our cares, our fears, our talents, our values, our love. Where what once was terrorists vs hostages now blurs and becomes a giant group of humans, together. Are we now seeing friendships forming? Maybe even romance? Or…Are we experiencing Stockholm Syndrome? (feelings of trust or affection felt in many cases of kidnapping or hostage-taking by a victim toward a captor.)Are the hostages learning to adjust to this new normal – finding ways to appreciate their spouses better? And the terrorists – some were teenagers with minds and talents – being used in this heartless way – could we humanize them?And then there is Roxanne Coss. Her voice and her music touches everybody. There is something magical and lyrical about her voice that seems to calm everyone. The beautiful, tender, lyrical language. The character development. And then…What was the point of that epilogue? Everything was going so well until then. Is that really how you are going to end this? I’m not sure I could accept it."
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10733023-blair,Rating 2 out of 5,"Some of you loved it, some of you hated it. I'm leaning towards the latter. I thought it was a good idea poorly executed.A small South American country throws a lavish birthday party for an important Japanese business executive with high hopes that his electronics company will build a factory to help prop up their ailing economy. The executive, Katsumi Hosokawa only agrees to come because opera diva Roxanne Coss will be performing. A terrorist group invades the party at the vice president's home taking the partygoers hostage. The hostage crisis continues for months. Stockholm Syndrome takes root, hostages develop feelings for the young gun-wielding terrorists, bonds form, relationships bloom. And the language barrier is not an obstacle thanks to the incredible translation skills of Gen Watanabe. And of course the music, ah yes the incredible singing voice of Roxanne Coss becomes a polarizing, transcendent force that beguiles absolutely everyone. No one escapes its wondrous effect. Just once i wanted someone to stand up and shout 'ENOUGH! SHUT THE F*** UP ALREADY!!!The first 3/4 of the story was boring. Characters in general, were poorly developed (except Katsumi Hosokawa- love that guy) there is little to move the plot forward or hold your interest (the vice president likes to clean. Alot.) and the writing is below average. She's one of those writers that make you think 'hey I can be a writer!!' (I cant) And the ending, albeit emotional, i thought was predictable. I was hoping for a more  imaginative outcome. The ingredients are all here for a good story, I just think Patchett was hoping it would write itself. It didn't.And that epilogue, as my 14 year old son would say, was dogwater."
15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/520753-kim,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was only 3 when Patty Hearst showed up on TV toting a semi automatic weapon looking bewildered and stylish in a ¾ length leather belted coat. Do I remember this? Hell no, I was three, but later… you know when I was like eight or nine and I would think it was so cool that she was brainwashed---what an interesting word--- and I’d have Barbie kidnap Skipper and force her to drop her frumpy ways and really live the lie…, I mean life. Sorry.So, what does that have to do with this? Well, I guess you could say that I was intrigued with the whole idea of Stockholm Syndrome way before I knew it had a name. Just imagine becoming emotionally attached to people that held you hostage. Isn’t that a bit fucked up? Duh. (As my 4 year old would say)So, Bel Canto, while the characters and events are mostly fictionalized, was based on an actual hostage situation in Peru in 1996. Where 72 people men were held up in the Japanese Ambassador’s home for 126 days. I must have been living under a rock, because I do not remember this… you think that something like this would have stuck, you know? I’m sure I was too wrapped up in my glee that Judge Judy was now being syndicated. Whoo. Can you imagine living with terrorists for 4 and ½ months? My god, I can’t imagine that the same level of fear is maintained. I would think that you would start to develop a relationship with these kids (yes, they were basically children) and start to feel that this is what your life has become. And so it goes in  Bel Canto , these characters, hostages and terrorists are introduced systematically throughout the beginning of the ordeal and Patchett does a good job of fleshing them out and getting us attached. To a point. I think that this is one of those books where your opinion of it will vary depending on where you are in your life. I can see this book leaving different impressions on someone who maybe has just found new love and someone who is jaded by relationships. Moreover, I think that this could determine just how much you liked this book. I’ve teetered between 2, 3 and 4 starts in just the few days since I’ve finished it. This is most definitely a chick lit book. You’ve got the Soprano who has men falling at her feet (almost literally) every time she belts one out, you’ve got the young idealists who, of course, are beautiful and destined for a tragic outcome… and you’ve got the older, more elegant group of men, pining for love lost and all that. Something for every taste, I suppose. The appeal of a good book is how long and hard it stays with you. When I finished this, I was eager to share the story with my friends and family but as the days wore on, the shine was lost and I started to see the faults and the hackneyed plot. I miss the first day when I was caught up in the story and lamenting the outcome. Why can’t it always be like that? "

There was no character that I truly cared about, and when the ""hostages"" became ""free"" or whatever I threw the book across the room and there it has remained ever since. A hefty dust bunny now resides atop. I'd rather read Better Homes and Gardens than finish this one."
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/233448-aaron,Rating 2 out of 5,"A novel about a hostage crisis that goes wrong -- with very sexy results, Bel Canto might have been a better read if at some point Patchett did anything to acknowledge the plot's ridiculousness. Instead, she treats the readers to vague social commentary about South America, multiple nobel savage tropes, and a crisis situation where people do have sex, but only after first taking the time to fall in love. It's also somewhat about opera, so allow me the metaphor that Bel Canto hits all the obvious notes with competence but without ever risking enough to engage the audience.Not to be a pure hater, I did love the hell out of the cover art."
18,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/142538-michele,Rating 5 out of 5,"Stay With This One. It's Worth It. Bel Canto is one of those novels that is good on so many levels, it's taken me days after finishing it to put my thoughts about the story and the characters into words. This work is as lyrical and dramatic as any opera, and the word ""brilliant"" isn't excessive to describe the talent of author, Ann Patchett. I wondered how she came up with such a remarkable and unique story, but then learned she'd been influenced by actual events involving a hostage situation in Peru. Patchett goes far beyond the headlines and enters the minds of the players on both sides. It's a fascinating story and a rewarding and entertaining character study.The first 100+ pages were slow going as the stage is set; however, the ennui I experienced while reading helped me relate to the monotony of daily life experienced by the guests of a party, who'd been taken hostage in a failed attempt to kidnap the President of a South American country. The country, unnamed in the story, is a developing, Spanish-speaking nation. The party, hosted by the Vice President, is a birthday party for a Japanese businessman. It is filled with an International guest list, including the famous and enormously talented opera soprano, Roxanne Coss. Virtually everyone in the room, both hostage and captor, falls in love with her during the four-month siege. The story picks up speed when two distinct love stories begin, one between Roxanne and one of her admirers, and another, which focuses on the second-most sought-after talent possessed by a multi-lingual interpreter, a Japanese named Gen. Each, along with several intriguing subplots, led to the building of a unique story and ultimately satisfying climax.The ending comes quickly and shook me to my core. It was not unexpected and yet it still made me cry. And then there's a surprise, which after a lot of thought, made perfect sense. Brava Ms. Patchett. My highest recommendation. "

The first time around, I just couldn't get into it - I put it down to not being in the right mood, although it was puzzling as I adore Opera and I'm keen on Latin anything and I had enjoyed Patchett's writing before.For what it's worth, I wasn't as enchanted with Anna Fields' delivery. I hope this audiobook is reissued, with a better production - I mean you have opera, you have all kind of languages, bullets - it could be an enhanced experience. Whenever a certain aria was mentioned, I found myself singing it, although it hurt my own ears, it's torture for those who hear me. I did get used to the narrator, as one does. As the novel progressed and we got to know some of the characters, I was completely taken with the story. I could easily picture the location, the characters, their interactions. I know this has been made into a movie and I'm kind of desperate to get my hands on it, see what they've done with it.So what is this about?In an unidentified Latin American country, a group of insurgents assail the vice-president's house where a big party was taking place. They were hoping to kidnap the president, who was absent, therefore they find themselves in a situation they didn't prepare for. After releasing the women, the kids and the workers, the insurgents and the fifty-nine others are locked up inside a beautiful mansion while the police were waiting outside. The inhabitants are people from many parts of the world: Japanese, Italians, Germans, Russians, locals, and the renowned American soprano, Roxanne Coss.My favourite characters were the Japanese men: a rich businessman, who's obsessed with opera, Katsumi Hosokawa, and his interpreter, Gen Watanabe. They were classy, dignified and very intelligent. I appreciated that Patchett chose to portray most of the terrorists as more than just jungle rats. To have even the most uneducated brought to their knees by the power of opera was music to my ears and heart. As it's been established, Patchett writes characters incredibly well. She's at her best in this novel. Bel Canto is probably my favourite of hers, so far anyway."
20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36348070-brandice,Rating 2 out of 5,"Bel Canto is the second book I've read by Ann Patchett. Commonwealth was the first and I loved it. I'd been wanting to read Bel Canto for a long time. I liked some of the book but there were parts of it that really seemed to drag on and I had no problem setting it aside at intervals. I felt like the action came very! late in the story. The ending was fine, however, I wasn't thrilled (or even kind of pleased) with the epilogue. For all the hype I'd hear about this book, it was somewhat of a letdown. That said, I liked the overall story enough to want to finish it."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54068-adam,Rating 3 out of 5,"I read this book because my girlfriend--who loved it--recommended it to me. She also implied that I could stand to girly up my reading list a little, which is probably fair. Man does not live by novelizations of '70s cop movies and '80s slasher movie tie-ins alone.Anyway, I thought it was good. The characters were all likable and the story was engaging, if wholly improbable (Bel Canto could just as easily have been titled The Lighter Side of Stockholm Syndrome). My main problem with it was the writing style, which I really didn't care for. Each sentence is perfectly crafted, and would make any MFA writing professor thrilled, but therein lies the problem. The writing is so well-crafted sentence by sentence that it ends up being somewhat characterless and a little dull in large portions. The prose in Bel Canto almost seemed as if it was written to specifically defy any editorial criticisms. It does this with aplomb, but the problem is that it never takes any risks either."

Julianne Moore made this story feels believable for me. Splendid casting.——————This book was so weird. Made even weirder by that epilogue.This is the first book I read that I did not like the epilogue.I just didn't feel 'danger' or 'passion' for that matter. It didn't jump off the page for me. I wouldn't have finished it at all if I wasn't ill with the flu. You know, lethargy and all. That was the only reason I didn't mark this as dnf.The voices in this had this flat tone to them which was strange considering a large chunk of the book talked about singing and opera and passion. I think at times it veered into this sort of fatasy land. Maybe it's the author’s real intention to show us how Stockholm Syndrome felt? Possibly though I'm not sure. I just cannot really see how everyone could love opera that much. Because everyone in this LOVED opera THAT MUCH.It felt like the author didn't follow through and just left a lot of things out. I mean a lot!. Disoriented was a fitting description of how i felt after turning the last page. I was actually laughing but then I have a tendency to laugh when things got too preposterous. I wouldn't say it was that in this case but it got pretty close.Of course, it was devastating for kidnappers and kidnappees alike. But I felt almost no sadness for any of them when the rescue happened since I already knew the outcome anyway, the author told us early on.The end of the hostage situation and the epilogue have this gaping hole left open. And there's a disconnect between those two events that I wish we got to get a glimpse of, if not a chapter.I still to this day, a week later, wonder why the author didn't just show us."

I loved the Dutch House, which I am now beginning to feel was entirely because of Tom Hanks' narration. Next I read State of Wonder which was an ordinary experience and now this - Bel Canto which was a real chore.The characters were paper thin, unrealistic and not well developed at all. What made this experience particularly difficult was the impossibly unreal storyline.Stockholm Syndrome love, inter hostage relationships, combined with chess, music lessons, concerts and outside ball games. This all created a trifle of far fetched, terribly written nonsense. Served up with lashings of over sentimentality.About halfway through I realised this was going to be an unforgettable experience. It was.1 Star"
25,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32318315-hugh,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was my third Patchett novel - I have also read the more recent Commonwealth and The Dutch House, and although I have great respect for her craft as a writer and her books are easy to read, I don't think she'll ever be a personal favourite writer. Like those books, this one has many endearing elements and is very well written, but for me the whole framing scenario was a little too implausible and romantic, and the ending a little too contrived."

27,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/225325-jessica,Rating 5 out of 5,"Exquisite. Patchett does two really remarkable things here. Well, she does many remarkable things, but two I'd particularly like to point out:1. When an author loves her characters too much, the reader can often tell. Situations and descriptions seem contrived, and there is a veneer of (usually unintentional) dishonesty. But in Bel Canto, it's clear that Patchett is in love with her characters, yet she is able to remain objective and in control. Her role as the omniscient narrator allows her to travel in and out of various character's minds, and she does so with grace and assurance. Each emotion feels true to the character, and each character feels distinct and real. Patchett's gentle yet powerful language moves around the room and through the diverse characters easily and intentionally.2. How often do authors rely on villains and extremes to make their stories stand out? What struck me on completing Bel Canto was that the characters are in a situation that strips them down to their essentials and forces each of them to come to know their true selves. What Patchett does that feels almost revolutionary is that for every character, from terrorist to CEO, when they see their true selves what they see there is goodness and love for others. How amazing it is to think that we are so much better than we know!Tragedy is foreshadowed from the beginning, yet the book is really about beautiful moments and realizations. When cut off from the outside world for a few months, both the captors and the hostages are free to discover love and other talents. The bizarre nature of the situation, coupled with the endless stretches of time in one place, allows for people to connect across cultures and individual variances. I'm making this sound cheesy, but it's not at all. Even with such an improbable premise, nothing is maudlin or exaggerated, no character is a caricature -- and that is a real accomplishment."
28,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/766524-robert-beveridge,Rating 3 out of 5,"Ann Patchett, Bel Canto (Harper, 2001)I have spent quite a while mulling this over, and have finally come to the conclusion that, patterned after Greek tragic opera or not, I can't forgive Ann Patchett for the climax of this novel. Much of that has to do with the beginning of the novel; I'd have been inclined to be more forgiving had the first hundred pages not moved at a snail's pace. But the book finally picked up, everything was going along swimmingly, and then, suddenly, bam-the most predictable possible climax.The story is based on accounts of the guerrilla takeover of the Peruvian embassy in 1992, but Patchett moves the action to another, unnamed, South American country and adds a few extra ingredients into the mix. In Patchett's story, opera singer Roxane Coss has been lured to the embassy for the birthday party of a wealthy Japanese industrialist whom the country hopes will build a factory there. During the festivities, the guerrillas invade, and a hostage situation begins. It drags on, and soon the strict militarism with which the siege begins evolves into a more relaxed system, where the line between terrorist and hostage begins to blur.It's after that line begins to blur that the book really takes hold. The original three chapters, that describe the scene and introduce us to most of the main characters, are painfully slow. Patchett hits her stride, and the book takes off. For the middle two hundred pages, it's easy to see why the book won the Orange Prize and was shortlisted for so many others.Then comes the climax. My initial reaction is that it was the biggest letdown I'd had in a novel in a number of years, and that's saying something. After some discussion, I tried to accept it as the pace and events of the book being modeled on Greek tragic opera (where such clichés as the climax of this novel were coined). I don't know enough about Greek tragic opera to really make a judgment one way or the other as to the accuracy of Patchett's patterning. I do know that in modern reinterpretations of older works (think Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres for an excellent example), what we often change is what has become clichéd in the years since the work was originally written. Such is not the case here, and it certainly kept me from enjoying the book as a whole as much as I otherwise would have.Great middle. Mediocre beginning. Awful ending. Still, the hundred pages that are worth saving are remarkable, and worth the price of admission. ** ½ "
29,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-mridula,Rating 4 out of 5,"There are certain books which start with a bang and drag you in. And before you know, you are in the midst of the story. Bel Canto by Ann Patchett is one such book.It is a birthday party in honour of Mr. Hosokawa, a Japanese tycoon, in the Vice Presidential mansion in an unnamed Latin American country, whose government hopes he will invest there. Mr. Hosokawa, however, has come only to hear the famous lyric soprano Roxane Coss perform live - he has been an opera lover all his life, and a fan of this famous singer from Chicago ever since he first heard her. At the conclusion of the performance, the lights go off and when they come back on, the party find themselves hostages of La Familia de Martin Suarez, a revolutionary organisation which are dime a dozen in most of these banana republics. They have come for the president, who was to have attended the function - but who cancelled at the last minute and decided to stay at home to watch his favourite soap opera. So the terrorists are in a quandary. Ultimately they decide to keep the more famous and influential of the hostages and let the others go. These number forty - thirty-nine men and one woman, Roxanne Coss.What follows is the surreal existence of fifty-eight people - forty hostages and eighteen terrorists - in the palatial villa of the Vice President, Ruben Iglesias. Apart from him, there is Hosokawa and Roxane; Hosokawa's interpreter Gen Watanabe; the French Ambassador Simon Thibault; A trio of hot-blooded Russian dignitaries; the priest Arguedas, who even after being released refuses to go as he feels his duty is with the prisoners; Kato, an employee in Hosokawa's organisation who finds hidden talents within himself as an accompanist to Roxane. Among the revolutionaries, there are the generals led by the shingle-infected Benjamin; the brainy Ishmael, who learns chess by watching; the talented Cesar, who is accepted as a pupil by Roxane; and Carmen, the girl soldier, who wants to be taught to read and write by Gen Watanabe. As the days go by and weeks stretch into months, the boundaries between captive and captor become blurred and it just becomes a seething mass of humanity trying to make sense of life at close quarters, in a suspended-animation-like existence where Roxane's singing is the only constant, the fulcrum around which their lives revolve.Everyone is in love with Roxane. Not as a person, or even as a woman; but as a symbol of the divine art which flows through her. Everyone want to possess her, be her - whether it is the millionaire Hosokawa, the government functionary Fyodorov, padre Arguedas, the girl revolutionary Carmen or even the kid Cesar who gets an erection when she sings. It is not coincidental that the novel opens with the sentence ""When the lights went off the accompanist kissed her."" This accompanist, who has been besotted with her and has been forcing his unwanted attentions on her from the moment they got on the plane, is a diabetic dies due to lack of insulin on the second day of captivity - as if prompting others to step into the vacuum. When she says she cannot live without singing, Father Arguedas arranges to get sheet music for her, and Kato jumps in as accompanist. From then on, life in the hostage camp is a musical journey.Apart from Roxane, the one character who holds the novel together is Gen Watanabe. In his capacity of translator, he becomes the tongue and ears of the imprisoned tower of Babel. As the days go by, the languages mix and meld and Gen becomes not only a translator - but a teacher too: most importantly, a teacher to young Carmen in the china cupboard at two o'clock in the morning - of Spanish, English and the pleasures of love.Language and music form the twin threads around which the narrative is woven. In Sanskrit, there is a couplet which says: ""Music and literature are two breasts of the Goddess Saraswati: one, all sweetness from top to bottom; the other, nectar to thought."" I was reminded of this throughout my reading experience.There is a type of movie in which the protagonists meet, interact, form and break relationships in the space of a limited amount of hours, in a gathering where they are forced into close quarters - Jean Renoir's Rules of the Game being the classic example. Here, the Vice President learns the pleasures of housework; the French Ambassador relearns his culinary skills; Cesar and Kato unleash their inner musicians; and Hosokawa and Roxane, and Gen and Carmen, fall in love. However, the narrative here is anything but realistic: it seems poised on the threshold of magical realism, a nod to which is slyly given in the form of one of the revolutionaries reading One Hundred Years of Solitude, and complaining it would take him ""a hundred years to complete it.""Being an ignoramus about Western classical music, I was totally lost about what the title meant and had to Google. This is what I got.Bel canto, (Italian: “beautiful singing”) style of operatic singing that originated in Italian singing of polyphonic (multipart) music and Italian courtly solo singing during the late 16th century and that was developed in Italian opera in the 17th, 18th, and early 19th centuries. Using a relatively small dynamic range, bel canto singing was based on an exact control of the intensity of vocal tone, a recognition of the distinction between the “diapason tone” (produced when the larynx is in a relatively low position) and the “flute tone” (when the larynx is in a higher position), and a demand for vocal agility and clear articulation of notes and enunciation of words.- Encyclopaedia Britannica  Though I got only a vague idea from the above, I feel it fits the ""vocal tone"" of the novel perfectly; with its surreal setting, its cacophony of voices, and its accompaniment of music. The prose is like Ernest Hemingway and P. G. Wodehouse collaborating.A wonderful read!"
30,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/210397-jo,No Rating,"i don't think i want to rate this book. in my opinion it's not a good book, but there is something very powerful about it and i don't think a rating can do justice to the combination of these two facts -- the fact that it isn't a good book and the fact that there is something powerful about it. it isn't a good book for all the reasons everyone who gave it one star brings up. what is powerful about it is that the whole book is a tribute to womanhood. someone told me yesterday that everyone loves women. it had never occurred to me, but of course it's true. womanhood is the locus of desirability. this book is a tribute to the desirability of women. this seems to me its great power. you can say that the desirability in the book revolves around music but that would be false; it revolves around women.what is powerful, in my opinion, is that this point -- that women are the locus of desirability -- is made in a rather unself-conscious, unexamined way in what seems to me, all things considered, a rather superficial novel (sorry everyone). i wouldn't be surprised if ann patchett were not even aware that she wrote a book about the desirability of women (or she may know now because i can't possibly be the first person to notice this, but it wouldn't surprise me if she didn't know it when she wrote it). the fantasy here is that there is a household of men and three women, two of whom are highly desirable, and nothing bad happens to these women. all the men fall in love with the women with a passion all of them find impossible to express, but the line into violation, abuse, violence, or even genderpower is never crossed. in fact, the line barely exists. it's mentioned two or three times in the book by the narrator, but it seems as if the characters, except maybe for carmen, cannot even conceive of it. all fifty-nine (or however many they are) men think and act as if they had made a solemn pact to forget that women are ever taken advantage of. no, that's not true, because then there would be some strain, some tension. so let me try again: it's as if the power of the music or the power of the captivity or the presence of the priest or something had inoculated these guys from the male drive to possession and control of women.as i said, the novel does nothing to delve into the complexities of this, but it is still interesting to me to see how powerfully this fantasy of female desirability/safety is constructed. everything in the novel contributes to shoring it up. the fantasy didn't tickle me (do i love my men and women locked in mortal combat?) but my guess is that what most people liked in this book, what drew them to it, is precisely this otherwordly, peaceful, tender scenario: two women worshiped by more than fifty guys who want nothing in return and would never dream of touching a hair on their heads. "
31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia,Rating 4 out of 5,"I am so upset. But not for the reasons one might expect. The fact that it was not a happy ending was expected. On the contrary, most authors would have made a happy ending out of this story, and I applaud Ann Patchett for not taking the easy way out- however much I wanted it for all the characters I became attached to. Which she did was not necessarily worse, but definitely as bad. It was not only sudden, but seemingly random. Almost as if she was rushed to meet a deadline. Almost exactly in the middle of page 310/318, Roxane Coss screams. Because the hostage situation is finally over. In an unknown country, in the home of the Vice President, a birthday party is held for Katsumi Hosokawa, the visiting chairman of a large Japanese company and opera enthusiast. To get Hosokawa to invest in the country, famous soprano Roxane Coss is scheduled to perform as the highlight of the party. Near the end, a "",very reasonable"" band of terrorists emerge, turning into a hostage situation when they realize the President is not present, as expected. (He elected, instead, to watch his soap opera, changing his mind at the last minute. After some negotiations, bring reasonable terrorists, there are thirty nine hostages kept, the rest released. Among the remaining hostages are not only Hosokawa and Roxane Coss, but an assortment of Russian, Italian, and French diplomatic types. Swiss Red Cross negotiator Messner is roped into service while vacationing. He comes and goes, wrangling over terms and demands, and the days stretch into weeks, the weeks into months.Yes, I said months. Over four months total. And everyone is friendly and no one is shot and there are a few love affairs. Believable? Not really.I actually was not glad to find out this was based on a true story. Somehow, it seemed, disrespectful, for lack of a better word. It was based on the 1996-1997 Lima Crisis in Peru. Yes, the unnamed country was Peru. Which was ridiculous, how far Patchett went to avoid naming the country, using all sorts of pronouns. She should have simply made one up if she was not at liberty to use ""Peru"", instead of making it a distracting ""secret"". Alas, how true to life was it? Definitely based on a true story, not a true story. Stretching the definition on that, even. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanes...) Alas, this is my third Ann Patchett novel, and, as always, her stories are character based. This is what she does best, and does her best yet (as far as the ones I have read) in ""Bel Canto"". I did fall in love with many if not all of the characters. (There were a few more characters than I would have liked to keep track of throughout). The omniscient third person point of view really catered to this book well, floating from room to room, character to character. That being said, supposedly this categorized ""Bel Canto"" as magical realism? I suppose that is one way to define the genre, but not mine. Magical Realism is incorporating fantastical or magical elements into an otherwise rational world, and this was more making a true life event unbelievable with overt scenarios. Not even merely sugarcoating, but making things up. The terrorists playing soccer with the hostages? Falling in love with each other, rendezvous at two in the morning in the kitchen cabinet? Alas, here are my reasons, why Patchett's beautiful use of language, coupled with her insightfulness and my consequential love for the characters she creates ultimately outweighed the idealizing and romanticizing.  ""Their eyes clouded over with tears for so many reasons it would be impossible to list them all. They cried they cried for the beauty of the music, but also for the failure of their plans. They were thinking of the last time they had her sing and longed for the women who had been beside them then. All of the love and the longing a body can contain was spun into not more than two and a half minutes, and when she came to the highest note it seems that all they had been given in their life and all they have them came together and made a weight that was almost impossible to bear.""   ""All of the orchestra supports her now, it reaches with the voices, lifts the voices up, the beautiful voice of Roxane Cossis singing her Gilda to the young Katsumi Hosokawa. Her voice vibrating the tiny bones deep inside his ear. Her voice stays inside him, becomes him. She is singing her part to him, and to a thousand other people. He is anonymous, equal, loved.”  Lyrically said; this is what amazing art can do to us.  ""It was odd the way they never spoke but always seemed to be in communication.""  Reference to the love between Hokosawa and Roxanne. Yes, love can transcend language.  ""We make exceptions in extraordinary times.""  At its heart, this is what ""Bel Canto"" is about. How we all might find out audacious, glorious, magnificent, impossible things about ourselves and each other if only given the opportunity. If only given the chance, we might do things we never thought possible. Of course, in this rendition, they are all for the positive. My thoughts on the characters. **** Spoilers **** Terrorists: Generals Alfredo, Ben, Hector. Ben is the main guy, he has a family, is very ""reasonable, is proud of his terrorists, expresses regret for recruiting some of the girls. Plays chess with Hosokawa. Recruits Beatriz, Carmen, Cesar, Ishmael. Beatriz is addicted to the Maria Soap Opera, Hosokawa gives her a watch even so she knows when it starts (one in the afternoon). Yes, the same soap opera the President neglected attendance for. She also tires confession for the first time there, a sort of coming of age. Carmen, I adored her. Vivacious young girl, torn between her duties and what she sees as noble efforts and her love for Gen. Was very good at being invisible, guided Hosokawa in his rendezvous, to get him upstairs to get room. Cesar is an unborn until now amazing Soprano, becomes a prodigy to Roxanne when he sings out loud for the first time the night after Roxane and Hosokawa's first time together, she being asleep when she typically does her daily practicing. Ishmael impressed everyone by learning chess by watching. He is small for his age, thus impressing even more in his hard work, always more than the others. If offered to live with Vice President Ruben and work for Oscar Mendoza after this is ""all over"". He dares to believe. Oscar Mendoza is great friends with Ruven, often worries about his family, fearing his wife unknowingly allowing young boys to take advantage of his daughters (the way he did her when they were younger), to the point of dreaming murdering them. He is an example of an interesting character. Simon Thibault is the French who cried himself to sleep, caressing his wife Edith's scarf, having reestablished his love for her during the hostage situation, realizing how much he loves her, before she is released. Victor Fyordorv proclaims his love to Roxane Costs with a cute, sentimental story about how his grandmother, above all, treasured a book of impressionist paintings, used gloves to turn the pages, only took it out sometimes, teaching him to appreciate art (thus Roxane and thus gives him some ""permission"" to love her). Vice President Ruben Iglesias. Thus is his place. Throughout the four plus months, he continues to serve as host, realizing how pampered he is, learns to truly appreciate Esmeralda, his maid who actually is the one to stitch a wounds inflicted during the situation, before she is released. He misses his children, his wife, wants to adopt Ishmael. Messner seems to want to be on both sides, obviously unsuccessful in negotiating anything. Father Arguedas holding confession with two chairs pulled aside, an arrangement everyone, terrorists and hostage alike, respect. He is the one hostage that volunteers to stay, not once, but twice. Tetsuya Kato is the pianist, replacing Christoph, when he dies of a diabetic insulin insufficiency. He used to be a secret pianist, but was the only one there when Roxane needed a pianist. Turns out he is a maestro, had him wondering what he will do when real life returns. First love affair. Roxane Coss, the great. Did not really like her, although Hosokawa send to make her a better person and more humbled. Christoph had shared his love for her on the plane, she had shunned him, she feels regret. Hosokawa discovers happiness for the first run. Probably the most changed character. His love for Roxane change him, shows him works and things he never imagined possible. Family and his wife were arranged, he used to see it as an obligation, time was everything. Now, in this works where tune had been suspended, he never wants to leave this was woman that does not even share his language. Second love, which I savored so much more. Carmen the beautiful young terrorist and Gen the translator. How they shyly like at each other and how that became her asking him to teach her Spanish to studying in the kitchen cabinet to get taking him outside onto the grass under the moonlight to make love to the promise of studying English and Spanish for two hours before making love but being unable to keep that promise. Young love (in their twenties). Not only young love, but audacious, unimaginable, compelling disremembering love. Now, the ending? Everyone dies except for Father Arguedas, Simon Thibaut, Vice President Ruben Iglesias, Gen, and Roxane? So why not wed Gen and Roxane? So it occurred in real life. Well, it did not fit this story, in which Carmen and Gen made such a lovely story. The same goes for Hosokawa and Roxane. Totally made their stories, the entire novel, disingenuousness. A generous four stars, although this is only by practicing my own disremembering in regards to the ending."
32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex,Rating 5 out of 5,"Bel canto means ""beautiful song,"" and Anne Patchett wanted to write a melodrama. Big emotions, big events, like an opera. The plot of her book seems allegorical; it's certainly not realistic, which makes it a surprise that it's based on real events. She was inspired by the Japanese embassy hostage crisis of 1996, during which a number of diplomats were taken hostage for a remarkable 126 days. She thought - I'm taking much of my information from a terrific interview at the end of the book - she thought, ""You know what this story needs is an opera singer,"" and here we are.What she's carved out of this lengthy hostage crisis is a utopian society: the have-nots forced to coexist with the haves in a world where art is the only diversion and the unifying force. As in the real-world crisis, people of many nationalities are gathered together. There's a translator who serves as witness. Love is found. They make beautiful songs. It's like a more hopeful take on John Fowles's The Collector.Looming over it all is the suspicion that this probably won't end well, and it's to her credit that toward the end she actually had me half-convinced she was going to write a way out of it. (This is before I realized that it was based on a true story.) Even more surprising, I wouldn't have minded: I liked her characters so much that I would have taken any cheap excuse to see them live. They don't. The eventual ""rescue"" is sudden and agonizing.It's a beautiful song, and this is the best book I've read in a while. "
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/612774-sarah,Rating 2 out of 5,"All in all a little too sugar-coated for my taste – the discovered friendships, unlikely loves, the pervading beauty of every damn thing . . . And the purported passion surrounding one of the most important elements, opera, was unconvincing. It felt largely like a vacuous prop to be honest, like rattling off a list of arias to prove yourself a connoisseur of the beautiful.But the writing was decent and I decided about a quarter of the way through I shouldn’t be too hard-hearted (and the book aimed to soften the petrified heart). I should just try to enjoy it, which, following my snobotomy, I guess I did. But I don’t think it was a marvel of modern literature, or that it deserved the PEN/Faulkner award. I took a look at the list of PEN/Faulkner award winners and have to say those I’ve read were in another league.Finally, the end asked too much of me in terms of plausibility. Not to be mysterious. If you read it, you know what I mean. Or maybe you loved it. My mother did, which is why I read it at all. My mother begged me to read it, as she sometimes does with books she's enjoyed. It is hard not to try to comply once in a while. Still, she just read another Ann Patchett book about a magician and I’m going to have to tell her I’m passing on that one. . . She also loved “The Kite Runner” and whatever that writer’s new book is. I got a very long begging on that, but my snobotomy only goes so far... "

When I looked at it individually, I wasn't that interested, and I stopped reading about after 100 pages.The characters seem uniform (except for the Mr. Hosokowa). Somehow, they became flat. It feels like there's no distinction between gender eventually, and the small quirks that separate each person start to fade out under all the jabbering about the opera singer. Exhausted, worried, bored, depressed hostages would probably not be considering a woman's beauty that much. I can imagine something else happening in a room full of men, isolated for weeks (months, or whatever it might be by the end), with a single, well-dressed woman they keep thinking about. I don't know if that happens, and I'm not really inspired to know. Just too much repetition.. There is not much happening, literally, or psychologically.I also doubt everyone would be so heavily interested in opera, and be so unconcerned about their lives. I can see people being passive a lot of the time, and that they would only get truly scared when they're life is actually threatened, but I don't see them being so casual like this. Everyone has their common knowledge of what a tired, deprived body feels like. I know I wouldn't think about men, art, or a few other things if I were in this state, no matter how much I love them. It just loses a sense of reality.. Makes me roll my eyes.."

42,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50297885-joy-d,Rating 4 out of 5,"The plot of this book is almost like the response to an improvisational cue: “an opera singer and a terrorist – go!” It is so much more than a story of a singer, a group of terrorists, and diplomats being held hostage. If you are looking for an action-packed terrorist takeover thriller, seek it elsewhere. This story is more about human relationships.A group of multinational diplomats, politicians, and business executives have gathered to celebrate the birthday of a Japanese electronics magnate being courted for the economic benefits he can bring to this unnamed South American country. The honoree, Katsumi Hosokawa, is accompanied by his translator. The highlight of the event involves an exclusive performance by a famous American opera singer, soprano Roxane Coss. Hosokawa has agreed to be honored at the luxurious home of the Vice President of the country, primarily to hear Miss Coss, his favorite opera singer. An unexpected hostage situation develops when revolutionaries invade the mansion. Their demands are initially denied, and an impasse ensues. As time passes, discipline among the revolutionaries becomes lax. Lines between the abductors and hostages blur, and unlikely relationships begin to form. A human drama unfolds, where emotional and psychological factors come into play. Of course, at some point the real world will have to be confronted.About half way through, I had an epiphany. The book is not really about what is going on in the story. It is a comment on what makes us human, a moving portrait of what separates us and what brings us together, beautifully illustrated by the interactions among the terrorists and hostages. Themes include the transformative power of music, the need to be understood, the desire to learn, the need to connect, and the importance of teamwork. These people, thrown together by chance, build a subculture. Time becomes fluid. Consequences are forgotten. The beauty of music draws them together. They take time to reflect. Some turn to religion, some to philosophical discussions. They interact and find common bonds. Initially, everyone is concerned about being able to communicate in the traditional manner, and the translator is in demand. Eventually, the language barrier dissolves and they find other meaningful ways to communicate – gestures, actions, mutual appreciation of music, and even romantic love. It seeks to explore the common humanity among very different people. The book starts off a bit slowly to formulate the relationships, but about half way through all the pieces start coming together. My only issue with it was the inclusion of an epilogue, which I thought detracted from the primary message. Recommended to readers that enjoy stories of the transformative power of music and love to bring people together, even in extreme circumstances. "

I really felt like I was there and that I was getting to know the characters as they got to know each other. I felt like one of them. Without giving anything away, I was totally surprised and shocked by the ending. However, in retrospect, I realized that it really couldn't have ended any other way. I recommend ""Bel Canto"" for everyone._____________________________________________________Added August 28, 2009:I was listening to the radio today. The local talk show hosts were interviewing a man who deprograms cult members. (This was in regards to the Jaycee Dugard case.) He was talking a bit about the Stockholm Syndrome. It suddenly struck me that Ann Patchett managed something quite extraordinary with this book. She made the reader experience the Stockhold Syndrome. We go right along with the hostages in identifying with the terrorists that are holding them hostage. How very sneaky of her."

Not sure whether I'm not reading the right books or she is just not for me?🤷‍♀️Bel Canto is about a group of strangers who gather at a mansion of a Vice President of an unnamed South American country to listen to a well-known soprano. The evening is suddenly interrupted when a group of terrorists take over the house and hold the visitors as hostages. Unsuccessful negotiations lead to the strangers being trapped in the house for months with plenty of time to form unlikely relationships. Even though I like opera and enjoyed the opera references, I found the first half of the book pretty slow, bordering on boring. There was not much plot development, however, as I got to know the characters better, I found the second half of the book more enjoyable. One thing I'm struggling to accept is the unexpected turn of events in the epilogue of the book that I consider ridiculous and can't get over it. Because of that I'm going only with 2 stars."

The country is vague, somewhere in South America. This book reminded me of Ian McEwan’s amazing but dark novel Saturday where the setting is also a hostage situation. I enjoyed Bel Canto more, it is less of a thriller but more spellbinding.I am drawn to novels where death is not used as the plot crutch. Rather in Bel Canto it is the act of observing how the characters act out their lives with the omnipresent threat of death. The plot in this book is not realistic and the author does not make any pretenses that it is. However the international cast of characters are all well drawn and it is rare that I find a novel where all of the characters are interesting. I think that is what made Bel Canto so enjoyable for me."

50,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1879031-lisette-brodey,Rating 4 out of 5,"Books are so subjective. No matter how much we know this, it’s still shocking to love a book and see that others hated it, or to hate a book that others loved. It’s the same for everything else in life: people, films, TV shows, vacation spots, singers, etc. etc. We are all so very different. Sometimes, when I finish a book, if I didn’t like it, I will usually have very concrete reasons why I did not. And sometimes I will have very concrete reasons why I did like a book. But often, as is the case with BEL CANTO, it’s simply because the book touched me in a way that I personally can appreciate.  Ann Patchett writes a beautiful story of a lavish birthday party in a small South American country gone wrong. A group of gun-wielding terrorists interrupt a party for a Japanese businessman (at the residence of the Vice President), hoping to take the president hostage and be on their way. But the President is home watching his favorite soap opera, and is nowhere to be found. The terrorists make a quick decision to take the multi-national group of party guests hostage, most notably opera star, Roxane Coss, the party honoree, Mr. Hosokawa, his translator, Gen, the country’s Vice President, a local priest, and many others. I like character-based stories, especially when they are exceptionally well written. I enjoyed seeing how the hostages and the terrorists interacted over a period of months, especially with music as the central theme. I found it quite interesting to watch how relationships developed and blossomed between members of the eclectic group of people who found themselves living together in the vice presidential residence.This is my kind of book as I’m a true people watcher. I can appreciate why it might not be for everyone, especially those preferring more action than interaction, but for me it was a beautiful story with some very tense, poignant and engaging moments."
51,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have never read a book like this before.The story opens at a party in an unspecified South American country. The guests include Japanese businessmen, French diplomats, the vice-president of the host country (the president didn't attend the party because he had to watch his soap opera), and the opera singer Roxane Coss. During the party, terrorists invade the house and take all two hundred guests hostage.The terrorists came for the president, and since he's not there, decided to keep the guests hostage in the vice-president's mansion until their demands are met. The guests are held hostage in the house for four months. During that time, escape is difficult, but definitely not impossible, but no one tries to leave. And really, why would they? They're trapped in a mansion, with food delivered daily by the police outside the walls, watched over by surprisingly civilized terrorists (most of whom are about fifteen years old), with a Swiss negotiatior to bring them soap and newspapers. One of the hostages is a translator who's fluent in every language spoken by the assorted international hostages, and they have a woman who sings opera for them every day. The desriptions in the book were beautiful, especially when the author describes Roxane Coss singing. It made me want to go to an opera, something that doesn't happen often. The story is unique and surprisingly touching, and I really enjoyed it. The ending was the only part of the book I didn't absolutely love, and that's the only reason this doesn't get five stars. Everything else about the story is beautiful in the most unexpected way."

Melancholy, yet infused with the beauty of the world; the glorious potential of life. How can such a perfect novel falter so fatally in the final few pages? The short epilogue is truly misguided, and almost undermines the rest of the novel."
53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70046142-elle,Rating 4 out of 5,"I originally picked this Ann Patchett book as my follow-up to The Dutch House in part because it was her most read novel. But also because it seemed to be the most action-packed; reading the blurb felt like a thriller or heist movie. I mean, there’s a massive kidnapping of powerful people from all over the world by South American terrorists at a Japanese man’s birthday party featuring a famous American singer. But what it ended up being was a lot of ...sitting .....waiting .........and translating. That’s probably my mistake for interpreting the description incorrectly. Patchett has a pretty distinct writing style and point of view that I should have picked up on earlier. Bel Canto isn’t plot-driven, it’s all about the interactions between individuals ensnared in each others lives as they deal with difficult circumstances. Her characters are rich and layered and I never tire of meeting a new one. So if you’re looking for something fast-paced and suspenseful, this probably won’t be for you. Not to say this book is boring, it’s not, but that’s probably due to the writing. Patchett writes mundanity with such an elegant flair that you might not have even noticed you just read 20 pages about the vocal exercises involved with singing opera. ....Which was one of the bigger sticking points for me. I just don’t think opera is as big of a deal as, apparently, everyone in this novel thinks it is. Won’t go too deep into the specifics without a spoiler tag, but it’s just utterly bizarre and pushing believability that a group of 59, mostly men, half teenage boys who have never seen television before, would be so incredibly moved by an opera soprano that they crown her their unofficial princess. How is everyone proclaiming their love for her after, what, a week or less? I feel like Patchett may be one of those people who deeply appreciates opera and maybe she’s projecting a bit here, but every teenage or young guy I know would have zero interest in listening to that kind of music. I would sum it up with this: Roxanne successfully negotiating with terrorists:And sorry to keep using the spoiler tag, but I really don’t have any other option! This ending was a slow march to an expected fate, but one that you were actively hoping wouldn’t be the case. It makes sense, especially once I found out this was inspired loosely on the Japanese embassy hostage crisis of 1996 in Peru, so it couldn’t really end up any other way, could it? I wasn’t clear whether the captives ever acknowledged that they had Stockholm-Syndrome or if they kept the facade going, but maybe that was intentional. I did feel like killing Mr. Hosokawa and Carmen gave them a way out of dealing with the ramifications of their choices during those several months, once they were on the outside.I also found Gen and Carmen’s relationship creepy. He is a fully grown man, and she’s a teenager half his age. He’s a hostage and she’s a child soldier who can’t read. This was just too fucked up to be actually romanticized.In the two books of hers I’ve read, Patchett has a type of understated devastation that keeps looping around in my head. It’s hard to shake. And even when it’s difficult to say “I loved“ something so melancholic, I do deeply appreciate it."
54,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76100631-holly-r-w,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a beloved book by Ann Patchett, judging by the 2,258 people here on Goodreads who have tagged it as a personal favorite. Since I have enjoyed other books by the author, I wanted to read this one also. The story is about a birthday party given for Mr. Hosokawa, a businessman from Japan who owns a fabulously successful electronics company. He is invited by the government of a South American country, whose motivation is for him to build a factory in their impoverished country. Mr. Hosokawa has no intention of doing so. His motivation for attending the party is to hear the famous opera star, Roxanne Coss, sing in his honor. He is her adoring fan. The birthday party is then interrupted by armed terrorists whose own motivation is to kidnap the absent President. (He had skipped the party due to his own wish to watch his favorite televised soap opera.) What follows is an almost whimsical look at the hostage situation that resulted.I found it fascinating to watch how the situation unfolded. The reader becomes involved with the daily dramas of both the people held hostage and their captors. Gradually, they get to know each other. Complicating matters is trying to understand each other when so many different languages are spoken: Spanish, English, French, Russian and Japanese. Luckily, Mr. Hosokawa has an interpreter (Gen) who accompanied him to the party. Gen becomes a central character in the novel.The story is imaginative and interesting. I like Patchett's style of writing and how she employed humor. Unfortunately, I found the epilogue to be disappointing, but can overlook it.4.5 stars"

56,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-kara-babcock,Rating 5 out of 5,"One of my favourite shows is Buffy the Vampire Slayer (I could get into why, but then we’d be here all day). One of the villains in the second season is a vampire named Spike. He’s a cold and ruthless antagonist, but then in season four he gets metaphorically declawed. With a chip in his head that causes him intense pain if he harms humans, Spike is neutralized as a threat. He spends a good deal of that season tied up in Xander’s basement. It becomes a running joke, in fact, how harmless he is, and gradually Spike transforms from villain to non-entity to ally. It’s one of the many subtle, long-term arcs that contribute to Buffy’s greatness.The hostage situation in Bel Canto reminds me of this subtle transformation. It lasts a matter of months, but in those months Ann Patchett manages to make one care about a dizzying array of characters, hostages and terrorists alike. This is a beautiful book. The prose is lyrical without feeling like it’s overdone. At first the emphasis on description over dialogue annoyed me, but I gradually allowed myself to become seduced by the way Patchett would dip in and out of each character’s thoughts, sharing along the way some of their background story.The multiplicity of these stories is key to Bel Canto and its ensemble cast. Although Patchett focuses on a small core of characters, even her most minor characters have a detailed, comprehensive backstory that provides their motivation. None of Patchett’s characters are stock, because she can always justify who they are. Normally this would be overwhelming, but the timeless, ambling quality of the narrative allow Patchett this type of freedom in her characterization.See, Bel Canto exists in that fringe space of absurd that straddles reality and fiction. On the one hand, it seems so implausible that a group of terrorists this incompetent could show up at a party to kidnap a president who isn’t there and wind up babysitting hostages for four months. On the other hand, situations this long have happened before. In this case, however, the combination of the terrorists’ abject failure to get what they want and the duration of the standoff contributes to a kind of mutual Stockholm syndrome. While the distinction between terrorist and hostage never disappears, the barriers to civility do, and gradually the Vice President’s house becomes a kind of community of unhappy circumstance.It’s a bit like a lab experiment. Patchett puts these people under the microscope in a controlled environment and watches them react. Because all of the characters have different ways of coping with their isolation, with the separation from their loved ones, with the sense of dread accompanying the knowledge that this can’t go on forever. Indeed, like many once-in-a-lifetime events, the standoff is a cathartic and life-changing experience for those involved. Mr. Hosokawa enters the house as a lover of opera—it is his passion to the exclusion of almost all other pleasures, including those of his family, who perplex and bewilder him more than they do provide warmth and companionship. Gen enters as an employee of Mr. Hosokawa, nothing more, but he gradually discovers within himself a capacity and ambition he had not recognized before. Vice President Iglesias undergoes perhaps one of the more interesting transformations, for he decides his role as host continues and begins obsessively tidying the house and cleaning up after people. In a situation where he is powerless to change their circumstances, he seizes upon what little power he has to make things better.Strangely enough, however, Patchett captures the nature of this transformation best when describing a fairly minor character. Tetsuya Kato is one of Mr. Hosokowa’s corporate vice presidents and accompanied him to the party. When Roxanne Coss decides she must begin practising again, we learn that Kato can play the piano—he can, in fact, play it beautifully. At first this revelation is a convenient plot point and emphasizes one of the book’s themes, which is that people are full of surprises and have all these hidden talents we don’t know about because we don’t necessarily ask. But there’s something deeper going on here, and I’ll quote from the only paragraph I bothered sticky-noting in this book:They spoke to one another by handing leaves of music back and forth. While their relationship was by no means a democracy, Kato, who read the music the priest’s friend had sent while lying on the pile of coats he slept on at night, would sometimes pick out pieces he wanted to hear or pieces that he felt would be well suited to Roxanne’s voice. He made what he felt to be wild presumptions in handing over his suggestions, but what did it matter? He was a vice president in a giant corporation, a numbers man, suddenly elevated to be the accompanist. He was not himself. He was no one he had ever imagined.That last line really resonates with me. Hosokawa, Gen, Iglesias, Kato … the hostage situation prompts a profound crisis of identity in these people, and they find themselves not just stepping from their comfort zone but leaving it behind entirely. But Patchett makes it happen so fluidly and so beautifully that it feels natural.I’m not a fan of opera. It’s not that I dislike opera; I just haven’t listened to it that much. I have enough trouble deciphering song lyrics I know are in English…. Anyway. I know for some people, Patchett’s decision to use opera as a metaphorical way to unify the story detracted from their enjoyment of it. Fair enough. However, Patchett is doing more than talking about opera. That’s how it starts, but pretty soon the metaphor extends into music in general. Patchett reifies the spiritual reverence we as humans accord to the experience of music. When Roxanne sings, she literally stops the terrorists in their tracks, momentarily making them hostages to her voice. I may not have listened to much opera, but I understand the power of the human voice. It’s in the orator whose speech sways the crowds not just because of the words but the way they’re spoken. I love just sitting in my reading chair late at night, a cup of tea by my side, with the haunting vocals of someone like Florence + The Machine as company. In a medium with no sound, Patchett harnesses something primal about our sense of hearing and asks one to listen.In case it’s not clear, I’ve fallen for Bel Canto. It’s beautiful as a work of literature. It’s beautiful as a reading experience. I’ve fallen for it so hard that it’s difficult for me to evaluate it critically, because honestly, I just want to close my eyes and bask in Patchett’s luxurious narration of everyone’s thoughts and desires.And then there’s the ending.It’s not a stretch to say I felt betrayed by the ending, at least in the first few seconds of seeing the scene play out on the page. To be fair, Patchett foreshadows the hell out of this thing, reminding us that despite what some of the characters might hope, nothing can last forever. Except that, thanks to the way Patchett writes, this situation seems like it could defy such a truism. The story has a quality of timelessness to it. Yet something, as they say, has to give. I understand that, but I was so invested in these characters that I wanted them to get out alive. Not all of them, mind you—I didn’t care what happened to the Generals, not even Benjamin. But to see Hosokawa and Carmen brutally cut down like that … that hurt. I wanted a happy ending for Carmen and Gen so badly.I don’t feel cheated though. As I said, the ending makes sense given the story Patchett has written. The characters who survive are changed, their paths in life altered, even warped unrecognizably by their experience. They have a new perspective on what it means to live. Fortunately, I don’t have to endure four months of being hostage for such transformation, or even a few weeks in Xander’s basement … I just have to read books like Bel Canto.

57,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1270803-terri,Rating 5 out of 5,"I love the writing of American author Ann Patchett. She can write brilliantly about human relationships and how they are forged... no matter what the situation or historical context. She makes it look easy but only an experienced writer of her caliber, can pull it off so well. Ten year ago, 14 members of an activist guerrilla group captured over 600 hostages in Lima, Peru. Ms. Patchett has based her novel loosely on what she imagined happened during the intense hostage hold-out that lasted four months. A very rough and bloody encounter of Peruvian history told in a beautiful, sensitive way. Good for Book club discussions."

These plough right through the different social classes and languages. The unexpected romances are also a nice touch, which also break through several barriers of class and cultures."
60,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala,No Rating,"There are a lot of themes here, opera and the bel canto tradition of singing, a siege by a group of exceptionally gifted terrorists in a south American country, communication difficulties between a group of people thrown together without a common language, impossible love affairs between unlikely characters. Patchett handles some of these themes convincingly, for example, the beautiful voice of the soprano reaching into the souls of the other characters and awakening feelings previously unsuspected in their depths. But as is the case in most operas, credibility was stretched quite a bit throughout the tale, not least by the almost complete absence of violence between the dozen or so kidnappers and their forty plus hostages, all confined within a small space for more than three months.The pace was painfully slow at times, perhaps reflecting the stagnant nature of the siege but the writing was excellent.

Set in an unnamed South American country, it was a pretentious bore, filled with stuffy characters who are suffering some form of Stockholm Syndrome as they are being held captive by guerillas. So the famed opera singer bonds with a Japanese bigwig, and other characters fall for each other when it’s supposed to be a night of real panic and horror- and there’s beauty in this? Ms. Patchett writes beautifully, with humorous sentences that sometimes leap from the page, satirical and sentimental at the same time- but this one did not do it for me. It is the epitome of Bougie fiction that I’ve come to despise."

As we get to know the characters, they are getting to know (and love) each other. A reciprocity develops where the captors and captives become fond and used to one another, despite the inevitable upshot. The reader enjoys seeing these kinships develop, even though they are impossible. Opera singing, music, and languages as sub-plots enhance the story in unique ways as well. I can see why this won so many awards. "

I've heard a lot about Ann Patchett and her books from my Goodreads friends. Many either love her books or find her works forgettable. There seems to be no in-between area with her novels, which meant that I had to give one of her books a shot to see where I land on the spectrum. This is my first time reading an Ann Patchett and it was a really nice experience. This is a slow paced plot so my friends who need action and constant changes or things occurring should avoid this book. For me, the slow pace gave me time to feel like I was in a dream where I could clearly picture the characters, the mansion and its scenery, and truly care about what happened to them all in the end. The epilogue doesn't really sit well with me so I'm going to try and forget about it.I truly enjoyed this listening experience and think the audiobook is the best way to go when reading another Ann Patchett novel. In complete honesty, I'm not sure I would have been able to stick with just reading a print version of another slow paced plot. Sometimes you need a little extra something to keep the interest levels peaked."
66,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1504904-kasia,Rating 1 out of 5,"Art, love and a terrorist attack. Sounds intriguing, doesn't it? I, certainly, approve of the juxtaposition - politicians and opera divas entrapped by guerrilla fighters in a villa, in some undefined South American country, getting affected by the Stockholm syndrome by minute. Sadly it wasn't what I expected. The opening sequence is captivating, but from then on, the plot becomes scarce and progresses forward at a speed of a glacier. The usual character build-up gets nowhere. As a result, characters' motives and behaviors remain largely unexplained throughout the novel, making it hard if not impossible to identify with any. And all further attempts at revealing what makes these individuals tick only skim the surface of their emotional life, leaving them seem cartoonish and flat. Consequently when both captors and prisoners have sudden revelations (Prompted by what exactly? Boredom? It's never fully explained...), we're told to trust their words and random declarations of love. Not all that satisfying, to tell you the truth. Shouldn't the author make me care for and believe the characters? Why am I asked to take that leap of faith. It's a lot to ask, if one's not a romantic at heart. But I'm ranting. Back to Bel Canto. Towards the end the action picks up a little, FINALLY creating a moment of suspense. But even that fails miserably, as the outcome is predictable and delivered too abrupt. To top it all (Oh, why, Ann Tyler, why?!!) you're given a sappy and uninspiring epilogue. Why was this awarded an Orange Prize? I clearly must be missing something...Looking back, I'm surprised I stuck with this book till the very end. Usually I have no qualms whatsoever about aborting a book. With Bel Canto, I was determined to persevere, to be able to count it towards one of the reading challenges. Bad judgement on my account, could have gone with some other book. "

The plot is basically a hostage situation taking place in a Vice-President's palatial home. 39 men and 1 woman from different countries comprise the hostages. The woman is an American opera diva. Pretty soon relationships sprout up between the captors and captives, including romance. Negotiations grind to a standstill, and time drags on for 15 weeks inside the palatial home. Characterization is one of novel's the strengths and drives the narrative interest at least for me. I guessed the ending early on, but the journey is more important than the destination.

70,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28905221-diana,Rating 5 out of 5,Thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story was a slow burn and all the characters and developments in the plot were so well developed. One of my favourite reads this year. 
71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury,Rating 4 out of 5,"I have been rather slumpy lately but after reading an essay by Ann Patchett I thought maybe she was just the thing to break the slump. And this got the job done, although it's not my favorite of hers. It had been so long since I'd read it, and it was shorter than the other one I had in the house, so it was the obvious contender. What I like about Patchett is the way she considers human connection and this book certainly does that, but this book also holds you at a distance for so much of the time that it isn't quite satisfying in the way I particularly wanted right now. That said, I think she's successful in what she sets out to do here, the omniscient narration is unique, for much of the book it almost feels like you are in everyone's heads at once. I just missed the intimacy of spending time with a smaller number of characters that you get to know well.It is almost cheesy, the way it sees a kind of utopia created by music in the most awful of situations. But somehow it never goes all the way into schmaltz, even if it is extremely romantic in that old-fashioned sense. Even as an opera lover myself, I occasionally wanted to say to the book, ""We get it, the power of music, whatever,"" but it still manages to be not quite annoying, just walking the line. The trick of the romanticism, of course, is to bring the reader into the same delusion that all the characters have, tricking you into forgetting that there is an inevitable outcome here and that it will never come. Like I said, she's successful in what she sets out to do. It's quite effective even if it wasn't quite the book I wanted to be reading. (That's a me problem, not a book problem, as I tend to say.)"
72,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23827-susie,Rating 3 out of 5,"I did enjoy Bel Canto. I found it to be a very pretty book in writing and plot. The characters each had something about them that appealed to me as a reader and made me associate with them. I enjoyed the idea that music (more specifcally opera) was the one thing that they all understood no matter what country they were from nor which side they were on. Though I do not know opera, it was easy to associate the devotion these people had to music to other things in my life which made relating to the expressive style of writing a tad easier. Understandably everyone knew how the story would end (minus one or two minor suprises) and I'm not sure if that made it better or worse. I like to think that a happy ending for everyone would have been possible, but then, like so many other stories that end with tragedy, I am not certain the book would have had the same force had things ended in a fairy tale type sense.The most interesting thing perhaps about Bel Canto, for me, is the fact that although I don't really have anything negative to say about it, I don't have anything overly positive either. I like it, but I certianly didn't love it. I am happy I read it (as I don't feel that it was a waste of my time) but I would not have ever felt that this was a book I just had* to read. The one thing that I truly remember from it was Gen and I found him to be a very interesting character and one of the better flushed out one. Perhaps, in the end, that is the problem: though each character is given their moment and has their uniqueness about them, none of them ever truly came alive to me. More than anything the idea of opera and music did. Maybe that is what was sought after, or maybe not.All in all, in my order of books, this would be a middle of the road one I feel."

81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17693553-melissa-stacy,Rating 1 out of 5,"The supposedly-literary novel, ""Bel Canto,"" by Ann Patchett, first published in 2001, won the Orange Prize for Fiction and the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction. The book was adapted into an opera in 2015, and then adapted into a Hollywood film in 2018. ""Bel Canto"" brought Ms. Patchett financial success and literary fame. The work of writing the book also introduced her to opera, a journey she describes in the essay, ""How to Fall in Love with Opera,"" which was included in my paperback copy. The essay's title was the working title of the novel, before ""Bel Canto"" was chosen. While the fans of this novel are legion, and ""Bel Canto"" came highly recommended to me by the literary author Colum McCann, when I finally picked up this book in February 2020, I was revolted by the text. Of the 318 pages in ""Bel Canto,"" I managed to read 42 of them before I put the book down in disgust.The story is boring. It's completely unrealistic. It's also entirely racist. I would not call this book literary fiction. While the story employs a somewhat elliptical timeline, hinting at the ending throughout the text, and the paragraphs are packed full of flowery tangents that signal ""literary prose"" and ""Iowa Writers Workshop,"" the text is dull and not realistic at all. ""Bel Canto"" runs on stereotypes and melodrama: racist stereotypes and racist melodrama, to be exact. ""Bel Canto"" is set in a mansion in an unnamed country in South America, a country that is only described as possessing ""dismal jungle,"" ""guerillas,"" illiterate peasants, and emasculated, wealthy brown men who are obsessed with watching soap operas, cleaning house, and fawning over white people. Plenty of countries are named in this book, and understood through the novel's omniscient narrative voice to exist with a specific history, and respected as such: Japan, Greece, Australia, Russia, the United States, Britain/England, etc. etc. But no Latin American countries are named. In this book, the ""host country,"" which is often referred to as the ""godforsaken country"" in the text, is not named because the reader is meant to understand the setting of ""Bel Canto"" is ""an interchangeable Third World sh*thole"" that needs no description and no history, and therefore, does not even get a name.Nowhere in the book, or in the supplementary materials published with the book, is it mentioned that Patchett used a real event, the Japanese Embassy hostage crisis, also called the Lima Crisis of 1996-1997 in Lima, Peru, as the basis for writing her book. Patchett thoroughly researched opera to write this novel, but Peru itself received zero study, zero consideration at all, and that fact is glaringly obvious on every page of ""Bel Canto.""If you enjoy ignorant, racist stereotypes about Latin America and Latin Americans, this book is here for you. Patchett employs every single stereotype I'm aware of, and a few more for good measure. In addition to racist stereotypes, there are some ableist tropes. The primary antagonist, a vaguely-revolutionary general who leads a takeover of the Vice President's house, is afflicted with shingles, which are described in great detail on his face, an ableist trope that marks the man as morally inferior and destined to die. In describing the themes of ""Bel Canto"" in interviews, Patchett has stated that it was her intention to portray these illiterate, uneducated guerillas as people who never understood the value of education, or the value of sitting down to enjoy a meal and relax, which is why (as Patchett explains) they turn to ""violence,"" which is ""ignorant"" and ""never the answer."" Patchett's comments display not only a glaring ignorance about the real lives of Latin Americans (people who do, in fact, enjoy meals and know how to relax, as well as understand the value of education), but a glaring ignorance about how the United States military-industrial complex works, wherein educated men who are able to ""enjoy meals"" and ""relax"" develop imperialist schemes to invade and dominate other countries. Violence is ""ignorant"" when illiterate peasants use it. But when ""educated U.S. citizens"" use violence, I suppose Patchett would say it's a mark of enlightenment, because white people.In ""Bel Canto,"" the illiterate guerillas take over the Vice President's house while he is hosting a birthday party for a wealthy Japanese businessman who loves opera. A beautiful, white American soprano has been hired to perform for the night's entertainment, and she remains the only female hostage in a group of 49 or so male hostages. The novel describes a fantasy version of the 126 days of the hostage crisis from real life, with the addition of a sole female foreign hostage. In real life, the foreign female hostages were all released after the initial shoot-out. All of the men in the story (hostages and terrorists alike) spend the book fawning all over the beautiful white American woman. If you are a white American woman who wants to experience the thrills and ego-boost of being the Center of the Universe, if you long to be worshipped as a goddess in the Most Unrealistic Hostage Crisis Ever, this book is here for you. Illiterate brown peasants, emasculated rich brown men, and intelligent wealthy businessmen are eager to shower you with love and praise, and obey your every whim. You will never have to worry about rape, sexual abuse, taking a bath in privacy, or using the toilet, because this book is Fantasy Crisis, and you are the star. You are the diva of this book, in every sense of the word. Everything about this story is artificial, cloying, and banal. On one level, ""Bel Canto"" is art at its finest: an artificial version of real life. Fake Life sells well as art, as do racist stereotypes, ableist stereotypes, and depicting all of Latin America as ""an interchangeable sh*thole.""But this is simply not the kind of ""art"" I crave in my stories, especially stories that strive to be literary. I expect realism and authentic humanity in my literary fiction, not wish-fulfillment melodrama and U.S. nationalism. I'm honestly disgusted that this book won so many prestigious awards. It just sickens me. But then I look at what happened with ""American Dirt"" in January 2020 (the backlash that book received after it was published), and I realize how far we have come, as a literary community. People are raising their voices more and more against the brutal stereotypes used in award-winning, bestselling literature, in supposedly-literary works like ""Bel Canto"" and ""American Dirt."" If Patchett had published ""Bel Canto"" in 2020, rather than in 2001, the ecstatic reception this book received would have included a backlash similar to the one ""American Dirt"" just received. In the case of ""Bel Canto,"" Patchett took a political story set in Lima, Peru, and made it all about a white American woman who is worshipped as a goddess. ""Bel Canto"" is an ignorant, romanticized version of real life that employs racist stereotypes about Latin America and Latin Americans to run the whole plot. The same argument has been made by critics of ""American Dirt."" Negative stars. Definitely not recommended. "
82,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1393741-deette,Rating 2 out of 5,"The premise of this book was very intriguing to me. A group of people, all from different countries, are at a presidential dinner party in an unnamed country, when revolutionaries storm the house and take everyone hostage. What ensues is a nearly 6-month long captivity for 39 men and 1 woman plus 15 ""terrorists"". I thought this would be a fantastic tale, full of rich characters...since they're all stuck in a house for 6 months there's bound to be some great stories (or backstories or something), right? I must say I was pretty unhappy with the character development. I felt like I didn't really get to know anybody very well, the love stories were very contrived and forced, the ending was incredibly anti-climatic and then really bizarre. I wasn't even sure about the motives of the revolutionaries, the author spoke in vague generalities about ""freedom for the people"" and I found myself asking, 'freedom from what'? And the ending...after nearly 6 months of captivity, the resolution (I use that term very loosely here) is written in less than two pages!! I kept reading because I was hoping for more details and a deeper feeling, but unfortunately neither one came to me. "

I think it very neatly shows off social constructs, humanities ability to adapt, and what parts of our world we internalize and perpetuate, even in absurd circumstances. All while being very empathetic toward a cast of people moving toward a rude intrusion of outside forces. It took a while for this book to click with me. I had it in mind that it would be a weird thriller, or something. But I’m not sure what I’d describe it as. Thematically it is perfect. The character work is top notch. It’s poignant and sad and a reflection of societal problems that brilliantly reflect the reason for the event to even happen in the first place. You see it coming and you’re still shot right through at the end. Brilliant stuff."

87,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3932962-barbara-the-bibliophage,Rating 4 out of 5,"Originally published on my book blog, TheBibliophage.com.Bel Canto, published in 2001 by Ann Patchett, is a melodic story of an extreme case of Stockholm Syndrome. It’s an elegant and meaningful exposition of kidnapping, but also of love. A group of businessmen, diplomats, and important people gather in an unnamed Spanish-speaking country to hear a world-renowned opera singer perform. They’re celebrating the birthday of Japanese businessman, Mr. Hosakawa. It’s what you might call a motley crew, but in fact none of them are motley. Instead, it’s a sophisticated group. But they have virtually nothing in common except possibly the desire for a night away from the routine and some musical excellence.And then the unthinkable happens. A group of rebels slips in through the heating ducts, and takes everyone in the party hostage. What they want is to kidnap the nation’s President. But sadly, he stayed home that evening, preferring television to opera. So instead, the rebels capture everyone else. What follows is a unique progression from aggression to near complacency. And maybe even love.There’s a saying that music is the universal language. But in this case, communication depends on Mr. Hosakawa’s translator, Gen. He becomes a central character, since his translation services are needed in nearly every scene. But, truthfully, Patchett develops many of the characters. This is a true ensemble piece.The rebel soldiers are diverse also. They’re young and inexperienced in the ways of the world, except for their generals. Living in a home with this much luxury is entirely foreign to them. But carrying guns everywhere they go is not. And it rattles the hostages. This is a story of contrasts.My conclusionsBel Canto is my first experience reading Ann Patchett’s work. And I adored it. She takes two groups of people and tosses them together like salad ingredients. The dressing is music, for it is the thread that winds its way through every page of the book.The musical term bel canto is a style of multipart opera and Italian courtly solo singing. Patchett creates just such a novel, with a blend of character studies and story arcs. We follow the health of some people, while watching over the blossoming romances. Yes, romances in a hostage drama. Hence the feeling that these characters start to lose the defined line between aggressor and victim.Through it all, Patchett weaves the melody of musical tastes and performance. The opera singer, Roxanne Coss, becomes both mother figure and object of desire. She draws her audience in, and uses music to create a kind of harmony unknown in diverse groups. This is a cultured version of the reality show, Big Brother.If you like intense character studies and locked room mysteries, this might be the book for you. There’s not much mystery, except for the question of how it will end for the hostages and their captors. But every step of the way is intriguing. For me, it was well worth my time."
88,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/346802-rachel,Rating 4 out of 5,"I read Bel Canto in the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, 2008. It was an excellent choice for an interim period: I was between projects at work, wrapping up the old year and planning for the new, trying to maintain a sense of autonomy while upholding family expectations as I visited my parents for the holidays. A friend from church choir recommended this book to me, presumably because of our shared love for music. Although Roxane Coss, a major character in Bel Canto, is an opera singer, an appreciation for opera is not necessary for one to enjoy the book. Aside from telling a gripping fictionalized version of a mid-1990s hostage situation in Peru, Bel Canto prompted me to consider some uncomfortable but important philosophical questions.What impressed me most about this story was the psychological evolution of the characters. After a terrorist attack on a party at the vice president's mansion - organized to kidnap a dignitary who was absent that night - goes awry, rather than leave empty-handed the revolutionaries decide to hold the party guests hostage. In the months of confinement that follow, the distinction between captor and captive blurs and their common humanity emerges. The prisoners, stripped of their identities as businessmen, learn to define themselves and fill their days in new ways. The opera singer structures her time and holds on to her sanity by establishing a daily practice schedule. A corporate executive reveals his passion and talent for playing the piano. The vice president takes pride in keeping a clean house, working with his hands. People fall in love.As the group in the mansion adjusts to their warped new reality, the terrorists' discipline slackens but the prisoners forget to seek opportunities for escape. Instead of pushing their limits, they choose to live inside them. How many of us do the same thing? What walls do we accept as insurmountable obstacles? What walls do we simply not see anymore? What excuses do we make for following a divergent path from the one that would make us truly happy? In the absence of familiar faces, roles, and pastimes, what matters most?I would have rated this book 5 stars instead of 4, except I did not care for the epilogue. In fact, I almost wish I had never read it. It seemed insincere and too tidy compared to the rest of the plot, which was rendered with compassion and humor even when it turned violent. I believe that Gen would rather cherish his memory of Carmen than tarnish it by accepting Roxane as a proxy. I doubt that Roxane could love someone who did not swoon over her singing, and Gen was one of the few characters who seemed immune to the power of her voice. Gen and Roxane were just not right for each other. I would have preferred for the final scene not to take place at all; if it had to happen, I would like it better if the Thibaults were written out of it. The epilogue was extraneous and distracted from the overall quality of the book. "
89,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103544-sammy,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett truly did an amazing job with writing this book. She wrote in a style that made you feel like you were there being held hostage. Time played no factor in the story... just like the hostages lost their sense of time. After a while you no longer knew if it had been two weeks since the terrorists had crashed the party, or two months. And when you do find out it's been two months you're just as shocked as the hostages.You grow weary along with the hostages when you read about some mundane thing taking place, but that's the point. You are just as bored as the hostages and even the most simple thing can be the highlight of the week. You are introduced to characters that you remember well, and then there are others that fade in and out of the background, just as the hostages see one another. You like some, you dislike others. It's just amazing how you become one of the hostages, yet it feels completely natural when you are pulled out slightly and become the all-knowing narrator.The book was long and felt tidious at times, but I realized it made you feel what the characters were feeling. The writing was beautiful and the characters were well-developed. It seemed a little too convenient to have the Ultimate Translator handy for this event to take place, and you could easily see it as a tool Ann Patchett used to get her characters into easier communication, she turned him into such a key character, he no longer seemed like a convenient tool.Overall the book was amazing, and I still can't get over how the writing reflected so much on the ordeal itself. The only major problem I had with the novel was the Epilogue just seemed tacked on as some sort of final closure. She could have just left the epilogue off and had a very shocking and abrupt ending. I think that would have been befitting and followed the style of the rest of the book. The ending we do have just... I don't know. It didn't seem necessary, didn't explain all that much about other characters, and seemed a little odd with the two major characters it addressed.Other then the ending... epilogue... the book was fantastic and a definite must-read this summer.Oh, and don't think this stereo-types South Americans as gun-toting terrorists. While some of it does seem a little stereotypical, the terrorists in this are really humanized and you actually grow to like some of them."
90,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/962322-dennis,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was such a beautiful book, more about love than terrorism, the prospect of losing love, and the impossibility of love under some circumstances as well as its possibility only under special circumstances - what could have been, if only... It's very loosely based on the taking of the Japanese embassy in Peru by Sendero Luminoso - that serves as more of a starting point than anything else - but anyone who appreciates impossible love, or has lived it, can appreciate this book.(Added January 2024: the state of Florida has blacklisted this book in schools, and what better recommendation can you ask for? As Ann Patchett said, you'd think that a book where a group is unsatisfied with the government decides to take matters in their own hands to overthrow said government would be just the message they'd embrace but no - maybe it's because they haven't even read it?)"

Beautiful people with their lives at stake? It sounded like a recipe for success. Patchett, however, took a good thing and smashed it into the ground. She bit off more than she could chew and both character and plot development suffered for it. It was as though she would actually have a good thought and then go: ""wait, I need to explain the background of this good thought,"" go on a 3 page tangent, lose the thought that she had, and continue sucking.This review is harsh, to be sure, but it seems all the books I'm picking up lately are just boring, boring, boring.C'mon literary world!

It was strong on both plot and people. I wonder if the film rights have been sold. It would do well as a movie if you could get a cast talented enough to play the lead roles.

95,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was a unique reading experience for me. I can only compare it to starting moving to very slow dance music which then loops and regroups and all the time, there's a slow rhythm underpinning everything, saying 'go slowly reader go slowly'. There is so much nuance, so many moments in time delicately worked through, reflected on, turned this way and that. Meanwhile the characters come into focus, a few at a time and there is a large cast wit many highly memorable individuals. Published first in 2001, the book's layout was dense with some long passages of exposition, especially early in the book. Those factors plus the unusual 3rd person omniscient POV meant I took awhile to become caught up. But I'm so glad I did because it's a beautiful piece of work. It feels like an ambitious book - the characters have several different first (and in some cases only) languages and the translator character, Gen is perhaps the most central character. But we are given insights into the minds and backstories of an astonishing number of characters (I counted 16), of whom I would call 4 the main characters. No single protagonist. What a brilliant idea for a book, matched by the artful, equally brilliant execution. "

Podczas pocałunku gasną światła, a wszyscy zgromadzeni są przekonani, że to element programu, tymczasem do sali wtarga grupa terrorystów z zamiarem porwania prezydenta, który jak się okazuje jest nieobecny na sali, bo został w domu, żeby oglądać telewizję. Kilkaset gości jest przetrzymywanych w roli zakładników. Pomysł brzmi interesująco, jednak wykonanie nie jest satysfakcjonujące. ""Belcanto"" ma klimat serialu ""Dom z papieru"", jednak w moim odczuciu nie dorasta mu do pięt. Brakuje tu emocji, pogłębienia portretów psychologicznych bohaterów, trzymania w napięciu, odpowiedniej dynamiki. Cała historia jest rozwleczona i mało angażująca, językowo nie powala. Tak mnie ta historia wymęczyła, że nawet nie próbowałam doczytywać jej do końca, tylko zrobiłam DNF, bo szkoda mi było czasu, żeby czytać coś, co przestało mnie interesować. ""Belcanto"" ma potencjał - inspiracją do napisania książki były prawdziwe wydarzenia, kiedy to w 1996 roku opanowano budynek ambasady Japonii w Peru i uwięziono w niej grupę japońskich dyplomatów przez członków Ruchu Rewolucyjnego im. Tupaca Amaru. I jak ""Stan zdumienia"" Ann Patchett mi się podobał ze względu na klimat i naukową otoczkę, tak z ""Belcanto"" się rozminęłam i nie mogłam zaangażować w historię."

The president has called off, preferring to sit at home and watch his favourite soap opera. Mr Hosokawa was wary about attending, but when he heard that his favourite opera singer, Roxanne Coss, had been booked to sing to the private gathering, he decided to attend. After she had finished singing, there is a pause and the house is suddenly full of men with guns, who were there to kidnap the president. When they find he is missing there are incredulous and angry, almost not believing them and thinking he is hidden amongst the people there. As the tension mounts, a hostage dies and the partygoers realise that it is not a game anymore. A day or so later there is a knock at the front door, the soldiers open it and on the other side is a Swiss guy who was supposed to be on holiday, is there on behalf of the Red Cross to begin negotiations. A list of demands is drawn up and he is sent off with them. The government is not wanting to negotiate unless some of the hostages are released, and the women and children a few others are let out, but they soldiers decide to keep the opera singer, and life in the house settles down into an awkward routine. A chess board if found and Coss decides that she needs to practice her singing to keep her voice in check and it turns out one of the guests is an accomplished piano player; slowly the authority of the Generals and their soldiers begins to ebb away. This is an interesting take on the usual action-packed hostage trope, Patchett has let the sluggish responses of a government feed into the characters in the home as people on opposite sides start to talk, develop relationships and try to act like this is actually normal life. It isn't but even then, love manages to flourish even under the most trying of circumstances. If I had one quibble, I thought that the epilogue was a little unnecessary as a way of tying things up, otherwise a really enjoyable read."
98,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6163718-rusalka,Rating 4 out of 5,"There are certain books that are discussed with an air of reverence. That are referred to by name, and everyone stands around and just collectively reflects for a moment with a ""hmm"" and a serious nod. And I feel that Bel Canto is one of those books. Which, now I have joined the ranks of those who have read it, I can see. However, I feel like the book has possibly grown in esteem from those group ponders rather than the book itself. Now do not get me wrong, I think it is a pretty great book. I enjoyed it and mainly the characters immensely, much more than I thought I would. I wish it was the first Ann Patchett book I read, although State of Wonder was enjoyable but this book was obviously a lot stronger. But I was invested in the characters particularly and wanted to know how it ended for them all, even though I had a feeling that there was some possible, dreadful resolution ahead throughout the whole book.Things holding it back from a 5 star read for me, and it's tiny petty things:- I read Roxanne's characters name as Roxanne Cross, and it's Coss, for half the book. I got very spun around that my book suddenly had a lot of typos in it when I noticed her actual name. I am not sure why I did this, but I did. That is probably all me however.- I thought the house was very, very tolerant, and unbelievably so, of an opera singer singing opera all day every day. I know that they were bored and cooped up. I know they had little entertainment. But not everyone likes opera. I am not a big fan and I trained in operatic singing for a few years. And because of that, I know what Roxanne's warm ups would have been like and you do not want to be subjected to that constantly if you don't need to be. I probably would have swapped to the kidnappers' side after a couple of weeks.- There was a tiny bit where the story started to drag. I don't know if this was deliberate to illustrate how long it had been. It was just a little noticeable but I was glad it passed quickly.Overall, though, very much worth a read."

The political situation leading to the hostage taking in the unidentified South American country and the protracted negotiations over several months are not the focus of the story. Instead, the situation is effectively a literary experiment to isolate a bunch of mostly strangers from diverse cultures and have them become a microcosm of human nature. The insurgents had intended to capture the President of the country as part of a coup, but instead they have ended up with only the unimportant Vice President and, after letting wives and workers leave, about 30 foreign diplomats and businessmen and an opera singer. The singer, Roxanne, is an American diva who captivates everyone, and her daily singing is a civilizing factor for the narrow, absurd, and dangerous situation they all find themselves in. The other main character is Gen, a translator for a Japanese businessman who soon becomes tasked with translating among all parties. The tale highlights the wonderful qualities of human kindness and ability to love in a situation of adversity. As in anyone�s life, many characters and the reader hope to linger and not face the ultimate resolution."

109,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus,Rating 4 out of 5,"BEL CANTO is an operatic story intensified by the passion of interspersed arias. That is to say, the story reaches improbably heightened emotional peaks and transcends impossible contradictions in its reassessment of love. Instead of the confinement of a stage, the characters enact their drama within the walls of a spacious mansion which they are unable to leave.The setting is an unnamed South American country. The government has thrown a lavish birthday party for a Japanese industrialist whom they hope to woo as an investor. The President was supposed to attend but canceled at the last minute, leaving the hosting responsibilities to his Vice-President. The industrialist has no intention of investing. He is there solely for the purpose of seeing the world famous coloratura Roxane Coss perform for this very private audience. Along with a clutch of dignitaries eager to schmooze with the industrialist, a few rabid opera fans have also finagled invitations. A trio of Russian officials from the Commerce ministry, a music-loving novice priest who leveraged a friendship with the cousin of the Vice-President's wife are among these outliers. Suddenly, the lights go out and we have a hostage situation. This might be summarized as the “Overture.”It being South America, the terrorists or revolutionaries (the choice is up to you), are hardly surprising to the reader. They are a motley band of inexperienced guerillas, underfed, ragged, uneducated and certainly not multilingual. Fortunately, the industrialist's interpreter, a polyglot, is present and able to convey translations: Spanish to Japanese, French, Russian, Swedish and English. The raid is already botched. The guerillas intended to kidnap the President, who is a no-show. They pare down the hostages to a core of male guests and one woman, Roxanne Cos, the opera diva. END: ACT I.The hostages lapse from abject terror to the rhythms of a new normality, realizing that their stay will likely be quite long. A member of the industrialist's group, a senior VP in finance, no less, turns out to be an accomplished pianist. Coss resolves to resume her regimen of daily practice and they arrange for the delivery of a box of musical scores. In a pivotal scene, Coss confronts the three generals leading the guerillas. She sings Puccini's “O mio babbino caro” from the opera Gianni Schicche. (Listen to it. You will recognize it immediately. It's one of the most famous arias in the world). The effect on her audience is electric:  “They cried for the beauty of the music certainly, but also for the failure of their plans. They were thinking of the last time they had heard her sing and longed for the women who had been beside them then. All of the love and the longing a body can contain was spun into not more than two and a half minutes of song, and when she came to the highest notes it seemed that all they had been given in their lives and all they had lost came together and made a weight that was impossible to bear. When she was finished, the people around her stood in stunned and shivering silence.” (p.152-153) Coss declares she will not sing again unless the generals give her the box of music immediately. This passage occurs almost at the exact center of the book. END: ACT II.Patchett dispenses with the political rationale for the situation almost immediately. Who exactly are “The People” and what are they supposed to be freed from? Instead, she provides intimate portraits of individuals. There is seventeen year old Carmen who can barely speak Spanish. She speaks Quechuan. She is so shy that she is dressed as a boy and hardly opens her mouth. On the one hand she is fiercely loyal to the generals. On the other hand, she has a thirst for learning, a quick mind, and an instinctive appreciation of music. There is the Japanese industrialist, Katsumi Hosokawa, who all his life had squeezed a half hour out of a long workday to listen to his opera recordings, and now feels enormous guilt that the hostages are here because he agreed to attend. Human connections emerge that are so deep, the imposed isolation feels almost like a gift. What starts as an uncomfortable and embarrassing confession of love by the Russian, Victor Fyodorov, turns instead into a touching moment of heartfelt candor. He tells her his life story: privation in Leningrad, a grandmother who spoke of a long dead lover, a book of art her lover gave her and that she kept throughout the war, wrapped in a shawl, and wore gloves whenever she showed it to her two grandchildren. Of his own feelings for Coss, only made possible by the uncertainty of their situation, he declares:  “It is a gift. There. Something to give to you. If I had the necklace or a book of paintings, I would give you that instead. I would give you that in addition to my love....When you think of love you think as an American. You must think like a Russian. It is a more expansive view.” (p.221-222)Other characters reveal themselves in equally astonishing ways.Patchett inserts sly bits of humor into her narrative to alleviate some of the tension. The interpreter Gen is so busy that he can scarcely eat the food allowed in by the surrounding government forces. He is unable to take his mind off the cake which he can see others enjoying while he goes about his labors. Later, groceries are sent in instead of sandwiches and the group must tackle the problem of meal preparation. The Vice-President suggests they ask Roxane Coss. After all, she's a woman. Surely she must know how to cook?  “Why would he think I know how to cook?” she asks Gen. (p.180) Fortunately, the French ambassador is among the hostages and he does know his way around the kitchen. BEL CANTO moves slowly, but I never lost interest. I did, however, have to take frequent “intermissions.” Patchett has a superb sense of structure. The encore Cos sings just before the lights go out is “Song to the Moon” from Dvorak's Rusalka. The lyrics speak of a water sprite's longing for the love of a prince. It's a longing that will reverberate in the memories of each of the characters as the novel progresses.NOTES:songs cited in the book:p. 7: “Song to the Moon,” Rusalka, by Dvorakp. 34: “Vissi d'Arte,” Tosca by Puccinip. 152: “O mio babbino caro,” Giani Schicchi, by Puccinip. 200: “Belta crudele,” Rossinip. 266: “Ebben?

He's a workaholic and only agreed to attend after hearing his favourite opera singer, Roxanne Coss, would be there. The party is going well until interrupted by a group of terrorists. Their plan, to hold the President hostage and make demands upon the government. When they discover the leaders absence, the terrorists are forced to rethink their plan.This is one of the most lyrical and poetic books I've read. The way I can best describe it is an easy read, soft and quiet like a lullaby. It's fitting though as the title translates as ""Beautiful Song"" and the party is attended by one of the world's top opera singers. Music is what serves to connect everyone in this book and I loved the fact you didn't have to know anything about music to appreciate the story. Music, like math, is a universal language.There are lots of characters in the book that could have ended up being stereotypes but Patchett ends up turning this idea on its head. Carmen may seem to be a ""hot-blooded latin"" on the outside but she's also a very dedicated student when she determined to learn. Hosokawa could have been stamped as a ""workaholic Japanese businessman"" until we learn he's a closet opera fanatic who savours those moments alone with his stereo system. My personal favourite was Kato for what he does for the house.The Bad:This book is much like ""The Shipping News"" in that the tension is undercut. We're told at the very beginning what happens to everyone in the house. This disappointed me because it swept the dramatic tension of the story under the carpet. But, this opened up another avenue for the story where the reader doesn't have to depend on this driving force. Instead, you're lulled into a slow passage of days that blend into one another and by the end, you're shocked out of this false sense of security that you share with the characters.The Ugly:The epilogue was very jarring to me. I wasn't expecting it and I don't think I agree with Patchett's decision, despite how it tied everyone together. You'll know I mean when you read and maybe you can explain why Patchett constructed it that way."
112,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/337591-zinta,Rating 5 out of 5,"When Ann Patchett came to the college where I work on staff to give a reading to our students, I attended. The room was packed and bursting to the seams. Her book had been assigned as part of a summer reading program for incoming freshman, discussed in groups, now discussed with the author herself, and all concluding with her reading. It was a delight. Many authors who write well do not read well, but Patchett does both - and very well. Bel Canto is a simple enough story (and those are always the best) contained in a house, specifically at a dinner for dignitaries gathered to celebrate the birthday of a prominent Japanese businessman. His gift - an opera singer. Roxanne sings for him, and her voice captures the hearts of all who are present. This, however, does not just include the dignitaries. When the lights go out, the terrorists arrive. This is not the scene of violence one might expect. The story unfolds on a stage of seeming opposites, the terrorists in their misguided ideals and poverty, the dignitaries in their wealth and isolation. Hostages and terrorists unite and interweave in beautiful song, literally and figuratively. A terrorist falls in love with a hostage. A hostage teaches an illiterate terrorist how to read. A terrorist reveals his own musical talent, and then, his own flagging self esteem, hidden behind his ever present weapon. Such a drama cannot end well, tragedy must break in on this unlikely community of souls, but this clash of reality is appropriate.Patchett is a writer deserving of her many awards. Her storytelling ability is keen, and her writing talent is often breathtaking. She has an eye for the kind of detail that makes a story become life. Her expression is fresh and her own. Her readings, if available (I understand she now does very few), are also a literary treat. "

Because the synopsis starts with mention of a terrorist takeover at an A-list social event in South America, and I don’t do terrorism for pleasure. Since I read for pleasure, seeing the word “terrorist” was enough to turn me off.How. Stupid. Ann Patchett is one of my favorite authors, and so many of my friends had loved BEL CANTO that I should have listened. Ach. Better later than never.The fact is, I don’t think I’ve smiled, even laughed so much reading a book as I did reading (listening to, actually) this one. There was dry wit and out-and-out humor. It helped that the audiobook reader was phenomenal. She had so many different voices to portray – Opera singer, two female terrorists, three Asian men, three Latin generals, a Russian, a Frenchman – that a lesser reader would have failed. This one spoke perfectly in all these different voices.The real gem, though, is Ann Patchett. She isn’t full of herself. Her writing is smooth and vivid, if spare. She imbues each of these characters with unique qualities, all of which blend to make her story an exquisite tapestry.“Bel Canto” translates to “beautiful singing,” and yes, opera plays a part in the book. Not being an opera buff, I wasn’t so much intrigued by this, though, as by the emotional growth of the characters as days of siege become weeks, then months. Some reviewers point to Stockholm Syndrome to account for the connections that form between captives and captors, but I think there’s more. What we see in BEL CANTO is the removal of people from their prescribed lives enough to be able to see themselves and their strengths in very different ways.BEL CANTO has zoomed to the top of my all-time-favorites list. I highly recommend it!"

It is unfortunate that several other components took away from the lovely prose.The plot moved rather slowly, which is surprising given the plot synopsis, and the plodding pace took away from what should have been tense and suspenseful. The ending, on the other hand, came abruptly and was too rushed. It is always a turn off for me when a love interest develops between two people that are inappropriately aged. There is nothing I can relate to about romantically desiring someone old enough to be my parent (or child), and it typically results in some disengagement from the story. The book also gave the reader an almost claustrophobic feeling with a desperation to get out of the house where everyone was held hostage. While this is a testament to the author's skilled ability to create a vivid atmospheric read, it also made me reluctant to return to the story once the book had been put down.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: If what a person wants is his life, he tends to be quiet about wanting anything else.

The true purpose of the party for the government is to persuade Hosokawa into building a factory in their poor nation. Mr. Hosokawa, on the other hand, has absolutely no interest in doing business there – he has accepted the invitation in order to see a private performance by his favorite opera singer, Roxane Coss. The party is in full swing when 18 freedom fighters come barreling into the mansion and take everyone hostage. Bel Canto is the story of their time in captivity.What a strange little novel. I was hoping I’d form a definitive opinion by the time I finished, but I’m still stuck shaking my head. I did enjoy the numerous amounts of characters in this book.

But add to that the layers of atmospheric brilliance. and you've got the kind of book that makes me clutch my hands to my chest in dramatic awe.Listen, I get that a lot of people hate the ending. Is it farfetched? YES. HELLO, of course it is. While Bel Canto is based on real life events, it's a dramatised version of things. It's a tragicomic tale of terrorists and romance, of a kind of Stockholm syndrome that grows so slowly and thickly around you that somehow, somewhere along the line, you, the reader, are trapped in the house of hostages and you never want to leave. It's a slow burn of a novel, the beginning might be too slow for some, there are so many characters and it takes time to keep them all straight, much less learn to deeply care about them. But once you do, once you love them all, Patchett sucker punches you in the gut."

However, it all goes terribly wrong when a group of home-grown rebels invade the home and take the group hostage because they were hoping to kidnap the president!! The action is slow. I kept reading and reading hoping for something major to happen but it didn't unless you count the last two pages. Maybe I was expecting too much. It was the discussion book for my book group.

I’ve never read Ann Patchett before, but I quickly became infatuated with her storytelling over the course of this novel. To be completely honest, this was a 5 star read until the last ten pages. I shouldn’t have been so blindsided by the climactic events. The story does, after all, revolve around opera. But I was indeed blindsided. I feel slightly scarred. It was still a great book, and one that I might even read again someday, but the list of people to whom I would recommend it shrunk significantly in those last pages.“Some people are born to make great art and others are born to appreciate it. Don't you think? It is a kind of talent in itself, to be an audience, whether you are the spectator in the gallery or you are listening to the voice of the world's greatest soprano. Not everyone can be the artist. There have to be those who witness the art, who love and appreciate what they have been privileged to see.” In an unnamed South American country, a birthday party is being held in the home of the nation’s vice president. Mr. Hosokawa, the Japanese businessman who is being celebrated, would never have attended if not bribed with a private performance by his favorite opera singer, Roxane Coss. Immediately after the final notes are sung, every party attendee is taken hostage by a terrorist group. The terrorists invaded with the very distinct purpose of kidnapping the president and holding him for ransom in order to free their compatriots from prison. There’s one snag in this plan: the president isn’t in attendance. It just so happens that Mr. Hosokawa’s birthday fell on a Tuesday night. The president catches up on his soap opera on Tuesday nights, and even such a distinguished and economically important an event will not draw him away from his television on this night. The terrorists find themselves with over a hundred hostages instead of the one important hostage they sought.“If someone loves you for what you can do then it's flattering, but why do you love them? If someone loves you for who you are then they have to know you, which means you have to know them.”This is such a deep dive of a character study. So many people from so many backgrounds are kept together for an extended period of time, outside of the professions that have defined them and without even the ability to chat with the others without the help of the lone translator in the group. The impact that the language barrier has on the group is immense. And yet, at the same time, it means absolutely nothing. What can bind up together during such a time? Music. Music is the language that everyone on the planet shares, no matter the language in which the lyrics are written. The way Patchett portrayed music and its importance spoke to me on such a deep level. With the aid of music, we see love cross the barrier of language, and it is beautiful to behold. I truly believe that music is one of the most powerful forces in the universe, and Patchett conveyed that very well.“She sang as if she was saving the life of every person in the room.”It’s amazing what strange circumstances to which you can adjust yourself. Even when you find yourself in terrible situation you never could’ve expected, sometimes you can find immense beauty in weirdness and even discomfort. And you can keep learning no matter where you are. Education plays a fanscinating role in this book. Not only how it impacts the life you live, but also how thirsty minds can find ways to learn in any situation.“It makes you wonder. All the brilliant things we might have done with our lives if only we suspected we knew how.”Bel Canto is a brilliant novel, even if I didn’t care for the ending. Honestly, as much as I disliked those final events, I could have respected Patchett’s choice far more had she not tacked on an epilogue that felt like a weak attempt to pacify fans by giving them a semblance of a happy ending. If you’re someone who can handle fictional tragedy and uncomfortable situations, and especially if you love music in literature as much as I do, I recommend picking up Bel Canto. Just brace yourself as you near those final pages.You can find  this review and more at Novel Notions. "
121,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1007892-bunga-mawar,Rating 4 out of 5,"Sinopsis pada sampul belakang buku hijau berjudul asli Bel Canto ini begitu mengundang saya mengambilnya dari bak buku obralan di TM Bookstore Detos pada akhir tahun lalu. Sinopsis itu, bagian pertamanya saya ceritakan kembali seperti ini:Pada suatu pesta makan malam para diplomat dan usahawan di sebuah negara miskin di Amerika Selatan, sekelompok tentara gerilya menyerbu. Mereka menyandera lebih dari 200 tamu karena tidak menemukan presiden negara itu - sasaran utama untuk diculik - di antara hadirin. Yang konyol, sang presiden absen karena ingin menonton telenovela di rumah.Sampai di sini, sudah sangat komedik sekaligus satiris sekali cerita ini akan dibawa. Satu, pesta makan malam itu diadakan sebagai hadiah ulang tahun bagi seorang asing, industrialis Jepang terkemuka agar mau berinvestasi di negeri itu. Dua, bisa dong dibayangkan negara miskin Amerika Latin itu susah payah merogoh kas mereka demi mengadakan pesta kalangan tinggi dengan ratusan tamu. Tiga, aduuuh... betapa memalukannya rakyat dunia ketiga yang begitu kekurangan hiburan! Sampai2 presidennya sendiri tidak rela ketinggalan menonton episode telenovela yang tayang striping Senin sampai Jumat malam, di mana malam itu tokoh jagoannya Maria berhasil membebaskan diri dari sekapan musuhnya. Dahsyat! Mungkin kalau AC Nielsen membuat survei, rating telenovela itu bisa mencapai 8.5.Yang berikutnya terjadi, para gerilya penyerbu memilih menahan para sandera di tempat hingga tuntutan mereka dipenuhi pemerintah. Sambil menunggu, kita lihat sinopsis bagian dua: Para sandera perempuan kemudian dibebaskan, kecuali soprano ternama Roxane Coss dari Amerika Serikat.Roxane malam itu mendapat tawaran honor tinggi untuk menyanyi di pesta ulang tahun Katsumi Hosokawa. Berkat status selebritanya, Roxane kemudian menjadi pengikat kehidupan di rumah dinas wakil presiden Ruben Iglesias itu. Untunglah pengarang cerita ini baik hati, menciptakan komunitas sandera itu kelompok kelas atas, para diplomat dan usahawan kakap dunia yang tidak asing pada karya Puccini, Verdi, Chopin, atau Bellini. Semua orang di sana begitu memuja cewek Chicago itu. Bayangkan kalau yang manggung malam itu Rihanna atau KD. Siapa coba, bapak2 Jepang atau Rusia atau Jerman atau Spanyol atau Yunani atau Prancis separo baya yang bisa rela berhari2 mendengarkan ""Ela... ela... ela... oo...ooo.."" atau ""Pernah ku mencintaimu... tapi tak begini...""?(hmm. Tunggu. Kayaknya ada salah sontrek lagi ya? Maap deh... Sengaja, hehe...)Demikianlah. Lanjutan sinopsisnya sebagai berikut: Kelompok tentara terus menuntut penyerahan presiden dan pelepasan kawan-kawan mereka yang ditahan pemerintah, namun tak kunjung dipenuhi. Walhasil, dalam masa sandera lima setengah bulan, semua sandera dan penyanderanya mengembangkan perasaan saling tergantung.Kondisi ini tanpa disadari terbangun atas sibuknya Gen Watanabe - aslinya adalah penerjemah Hosokawa - mondar-mandir menerjemahkan di berbagai sudut rumah itu: antara sesama sandera, antara sandera dan penyandera, serta antara penyandera dengan negosiator yang dikirim pemerintah, si orang Swiss Joachim Messner. Dari bagian ini, kita akan membaca dunia yang tersembunyi di balik partitur musik di atas piano Steinway di rumah sekapan para sandera itu. Hosokawa boleh dibilang pengagum Roxane, bahkan Roxane juga yang menjadi alasan satu-satunya hadir di perjamuan malam itu. Yang tak disangka, wakil presiden perusahaan Hosokawa sendiri, Tetsuya Kato, langsung menyingkap rahasianya sebagai pianis handal demi mengiringi Roxane. Bagaimana Fyodorov, menteri canggung dari Rusia tak bisa mengelak dari keindahan pesona lagu-lagu klasik itu membuat kita menyaksikan pernyataan cintanya yang tanpa syarat, karena tak minta dibalas. Demikian pula wapres Ruben Iglesias, yang selama ini cuma ban serep di negaranya, bisa menemukan perhatian dan cintanya pada hal2 kecil di sekitarnya, yang ternyata lebih penting dan bermakna daripada jabatan wakil presiden.Ternyata musik yang dinyanyikan diva itu tidak hanya menyentuh para pria kaya yang sering mendatangi gedung opera. Rasanya begitu bergetar saat membaca Roxane dan nyanyiannya memenuhi hati Pastor Arguedas, pria yang telah berikrar mengabdi pada Tuhan itu untuk berbuat baik. Salah satu anggota belia pasukan penyandera, Carmen, sampai rela tiap malam tidur berjaga di lantai depan pintu kamar Roxane, dan koleganya Cesar begitu penuh perasaan menyanyikan kembali lagu2 sang soprano tanpa paham artinya. Dan betapa para ""jenderal"" pasukan gerilya itu bisa begitu pengertian, memaklumi semua kebutuhan sang penyanyi il bel canto itu.Ah, ya... masa penyanderaan yang diisi dengan latihan menyanyi Roxane dan Cesar, tanding catur Hosokawa dan Jenderal Alfredo, kursus privat membaca dan menulis untuk Carmen oleh Gen, serta masak makan malam bareng itu akhirnya sukses menciptakan Sindrom Stockholm. Itu lho, sebutan bagi kondisi di mana korban penculikan atau penyekapan malah menjadi simpati pada penyekapnya. Baik para sandera maupun penyanderanya, sebagian tidak ingin kemesraan itu cepat berlalu. Mengutip lagu jadulnya Search, ""Kita yang terlena, sehingga musim berubah..."" dari sini cerita ini berjalan makin datar, hingga tak terasa lembar buku yang kita tahan di tangan sebelah kanan mulai menipis... menipis... dan berakhirlah kidung yang indah ini.Berakhir dengan cara yang mungkin sudah terlintas dalam benak. Berakhir sebagai jalan yang paling mungkin terjadi, kalau kita sering membaca berita penyanderaan.Tapi tetap saja...Sulit sekali buat saya menerima kenyataan bahwa kidung indah ini sudah tidak mengalun lagi. Sulit juga bagi saya untuk tidak beberapa jenak memikirkan betapa banyak anak2 di belahan dunia ini telah meyandang senjata bahkan membunuh. Sebagian besar karena terpaksa, demi kepentingan yang tidak mereka pahami tujuannya. Di Myanmar. Irlandia. Gaza, Somalia. Angola. El Salvador. Di mana2. Saya tak bisa menghindar dari memikirkan kenyataan bahwa setiap ada revolusi, rakyat kecil selalu menjadi korban terbesar, bukan seorang presiden gila telenovela. Sialannya, kok saya tidak bisa tidak menuding Amerika Serikat sebagai biang kerok, nih???Satu hal lagi terus melekat: jangan pernah menunda untuk berbuat kebaikan. Seperti saya tidak menunda membuka Embi dan mengetik review ini begitu Bel Canto ini selesai saya baca.Catatan tambahan: 1. saya memilih tidak menuliskan pasukan penyandera sebagai ""teroris"", istilah yang dipakai pengarang buku ini, karena ingat bagian dari novel Contact-nya Carl Sagan: ""Jika kamu suka pada mereka, maka mereka adalah pejuang kemerdekaan; jika kamu tidak suka, mereka adalah teroris; dan jika kamu tidak bisa memutuskan menyukai mereka atau tidak, sebut saja mereka pasukan gerilya."" Posisi saya adalah pembaca, bukan sandera, jadi mereka adalah gerilya.2. saya jadi ingin mendengarkan Verdi lagi. Ada yang bersedia kirim albumnya? *ga modal*15/01.2010"

123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1721356-ioana,Rating 2 out of 5,"What Bel Canto thinks it is: a lyrical, magically beautiful exploration of the unlikely bonds that can form between people, especially under duress-conditions (i.e. a prolonged hostage situation); a tender examination of the underlying goodness of all people (even those deemed criminals, i.e. the hostage takers); a metaphorically rich illustration of the parallels between beauty (opera in this case) and life, coupled with an interrogation of ""what really matters in the end"" when we are faced with life-death scenarios.What Bel Canto  actually is: a privileged, ahistorical, implausible, racist, sexist, meandering ode to the power of opera. (1) Privilege & History: I am highly indebted to Annalisa's review for pointing out this glaring deficiency. Bel Canto is really a book about opera/music/love of art and the power of art to sustain us through crisis. But there's a real story here, too. The story of a 1996 hostage attack on the home of the Japanese ambassador to Peru, and subsequent events (please read Annalisa's review!). And the fact that Patchett not only excludes all politics from her telling, but also does not deem it necessary to bring attention to the historical context for her work and to the plight of the real-world people she describes, even in the epilogue or in ""author notes"", is, imho, dangerous for its omissions. This is a story of terrorism as can only be told by a privileged person who has never known oppression as experienced by those who truly suffer, and in remaking their story into a ode to opera, Patchett not only silences their voices, but minimizes their plight and in effect, colonizes the collective memory of the historical event.(2) Racism & Sexism: present themselves frequently throughout the pages of Bel Canto. There is the ""unnamed country"", of course, and the ""noble-savage"" tropes used in much older literature. It's a story we've encountered too many times before: savages from the mountain, fawning over soap and linen, with powerful white men aghast at having to cook their own dinners. Then there is the constant fawning over the Opera singer, who sustains the group through her heavenly singing, and who sends everyone into paroxysms of delight. Those are but two examples, there are plenty more instances of thinly veiled racist/sexist stereotyping.(3) Meandering Ode to Opera: This was probably one of the most boring books I've ever read, and one of the few I stayed up to finish in a day or so because I just couldn't wait for it to be over, to move on to the next thing. There's no reason for us to care about any of the hostages or terrorists, because we don't know them before the story starts; and while their stories unfold with the crisis, since there is no grander arc than ""look at this person, he has a history, a brother or mother whom he loves, he is a good person"", these interludes and backgrounds provide little satisfaction or enticement to continue reading. Too many times I wanted to just stop wasting my time and shelf this as ""unfinished"", but I plodded on for one reason alone: despite how turned off I was in every respect, I will allow that Patchett is a skilled writer, so I felt I owed this book at least a skim-through to the end (this is also the reason for the additional star above 1).There's a bunch of other reasons I didn't enjoy this, but I've already wasted too much time trying to finish both reading and writing any kind of review, so I'll leave with this: (4) Implausibility: there's simply no reason to believe a true hostage scenario would unfold as Patchett describes. She certainly has no experience in the matter, and much of what occurs reads like a romanticized version of what an art/opera afficionado may dream into being - that, in the end, when faced with death, wo/mankind would choose art, and be saved by art, and realize that the only thing that matters is art and love. While I myself would love to believe this, I am not naive; if anything, this perspective only serves to underline Patchett's privilege, and the ways in which it blinds her to the realities of suffering as it actually occurs in the ""real"", historical world.

125,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bel Canto is an intensely romantic book based on (or inspired by) the events of the 1996 Japanese embassy hostage crisis in Peru. But it’s not the trashy sort of book you might expect when you hear “romance” and “hostage crisis” in the same sentence, with a young female captive falling in love with the terrorists’ strong but sensitive captain, etc. Instead it’s a leisurely-paced story of life inside the captured vice-presidential residence during a months-long stalemate between the militants and the government. While they wait, the boundaries between captors and captives are eroded and people fall in love, discover new talents and reevaluate their priorities.The reason this book works--for me, anyway--is balance. The extent to which the story is an out-of-body experience for everyone involved is balanced by the mundane details of daily life. The hostage situation seems to bring out the best in everyone; but still, the characters are well-developed and feel real and human and believable in their roles (with one exception, discussed below). There’s romance--more in the general atmosphere than of the lovey-dovey sort--but there’s also self-centeredness, and the characters have believable interior lives. There’s intense emotion, but proportionate to the circumstances, and the characters’ behavior is generally reserved. The result is a lovely story that--while we can envision it developing quite differently--accommodates the suspension of disbelief and steers clear of melodrama.Only two aspects of this book fall short. The ending is rushed, and the epilogue feels tacked-on and makes little sense. And the terrorists’ teenage foot soldiers (comprising the majority of the group), while realistic enough as teenagers, aren’t quite believable as terrorists. None seem to have any strong feelings or opinions about their cause, nor any particular propensity for aggression. The three “Generals” are fully believable, but kept on the story’s periphery. Leaving the impression that Patchett assumed she couldn’t get readers to sympathize with major characters who are committed to the cause they’re supposedly fighting for, and thereby sold herself short. (I created a “militants, terrorists and guerrillas"" shelf just to prove how many authors have in fact pulled this off successfully, and even I was surprised by how many books I found to put on it; almost all portray their militant characters sympathetically. Apparently, terrorists are only really villainous in thrillers. Which I don’t read.)Opinions on this book vary drastically, from those who consider it literary fiction to those who think it’s trashy pop lit. I’d put it right in the middle, as a fluidly written piece of mainstream fiction. Recommended for those looking for an unusual, romantic story with solid characterization."

Стоя недокосната, сякаш отлежава на купчинката, все най-отгоре, с интересната си почти мрачна корица и непрегъвани страници. Четох какво ли не за нея, но то винаги избледняваше на фона на някоя друга книга с по-шарена или по-екстравагантна корица. Защо ли не прочетох тогава поне малко от началото, за да потъна в нереалната атмосфера, създадена от Ан Патчет. И един ден попаднах на кратко аматьорско клипче, заснето в оперна зала. Звукът не беше добър, предаден неадекватно през мобилно устройство, но ръката, държаща устройството, потрепваше неконтролируемо при случаите, в които изпълнителката на арията влагаше мощ в гласа си. Разбрах, че певицата е „превзела“ изцяло човека с телефона и той е в плен, неспособен да контролира записа си. Клипчето трая около минута и прекъсна поредния изблик от страст на изпълнителката. За късмет следващото клипче показваше точно същото, но записано професионално. Заглавието беше O mio babbino caro от някаква опера на Пучини. Същата вечер в главата ми се преповтаряше все същия откъс, докато от време на време хвърлях по някой поглед на „Белканто“ на Ан Патчет. После просто я взех и започнах да чета. „Когато светлините изгаснаха, пианистът я целуна. Може би тъкмо беше започнал да се обръща към нея миг преди да стане тъмно, може би само бе вдигнал ръцете си. Сигурно бе имало някакво движение, жест, защото всеки присъстващ в стаята по-късно си спомняше за целувката. Не я бяха видели действително, това би било невъзможно. Тъмнината, която ги обгърна, беше стряскаща и непрогледна.“ Всичко продължи няколко часа, без да мога да откъсна поглед от книгата. Стилът на писане на Ан Патчет се оказа толкова притегателен за мен, че почти не осъзнавах аз ли чета или някой друг реди думите в главата ми. „Белканто“ се оказа един изящно написан роман, който действително омагьосва. И въпреки че от време на време повяхваше заради нетактичните тиради на един от героите (някакъв си самозван генерал), чувството остана до края. Като че бях награден с една от най-пленителните истории, четени от мен през последните десетина години. Всъщност в нея не думите са възвишени, а идеята за едно духовно пречистване (странни думи в моята уста, да знаете), стелещи се като атмосфера наоколо. Изказът е плавен и ненатрапващ се, като безкрайно пътуване на вълна, която никога няма да се ра��бие в бряг. Сцената е камерна, мащабите са сведени до една голяма стая, където известен японски бизнесмен празнува рождения си ден. (Продължава в блога: http://knijenpetar.blogspot.bg/2015/1...)"
127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24266382-ashley,Rating 3 out of 5,"An ode to art. This book can go hand-in-hand with “Dead Poet’s Society.” It was wonderful and poignant -- but unfortunately the last chapter was the most emotional, and the only part of the novel to incite much of a reaction from me.  It’s hard to explain exactly why I'm on the fence, but if I’m trying, I suppose I could say it has something to do with the slow-moving plot that failed to quicken until the very end. If you're looking for the slowest of burns, then look no further; Bel Canto is for you.Certainly, it's tough to write an engaging story that takes place solely in one location (a large house in a South American country) and over the course of several interchangeable days; it’s almost impossible to write such a story that is also exciting and intense and gripping. Ann Patchett came close to achieving this. Her eloquent writing style almost made this monotonous book mesmerizing. And while I understand that this book has been heralded as one of the best to ever be published, while I understand there’s more to literature than simply its ability to keep you engrossed, I unfortunately cannot account for Bel Canto’s acclaim. I found the plot too slow, too meandering, with, granted, frequent sparks of brilliance – but nothing consistent enough to make reading it NOT A CHORE. It had a diverse array of characters that, though I found were boring, were certainly multifaceted, two-dimensional, and whom I definitely sympathized with. My favourite was Simon Thibault and I wish less time had been spent on Roxane to make way for more of Thibault’s kitchen adventures. (For the record, there was nothing to dislike about Roxane but there was nothing to love about her either. And on top of this, I think that having every man fall in love with her was a little too much for the reader to stomach. She started to appear like a sickly sweet siren, like tea with too much sugar in it, and when all the rational men fell head-over-heels it made me wish they would grow up. Sure, it drove the point home that everyone is attracted to music or art in some form – but even Messner succumbed to her beauty?? Really? And all the married men?? And even the terrorists? Bye.) I loved that this book demonstrated the importance of art in life and how art lies at the core of everything we see / hear / do (i.e. music, paintings, film, language, cooking, interior décor…). I loved that a diverse collection of characters were able to make profound connections with each other against the odds. It taught me to appreciate life with all its twists and turns, to look for beauty in everything, to see art and wonder in everyone… And yet it was such a chore."
128,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131009655-ana,Rating 3 out of 5,"I don’t know how this book begins and it kills me. The reason is that in the copy I own, the first 38 pages are not from Bel Canto, but from Happiness (TM), a satire about consumerist culture by Will Ferguson. It also kills me that I don’t know how Happiness (TM) ends (this sadistic bookbinding error is brutal!). At the bottom of p.38 there’s a tongue-in-cheek observation about Jenni who felt the flow of the universe directing her towards fortune cookies. As I was becoming emotionally attached to Jenni’s story, without my consent, p.39 pushed me into Bel Canto’s suspenseful plot with these words: “armed man behind him.” For the rest of the book I had constant anxiety the narrative would jump back, mid-sentence, to Happiness (TM), which wouldn’t have made me happy at all.Bel Canto is loosely based on the historical hostage situation known as Lima Crisis. Patchett is a good writer, but here she romanticizes a life-threatening situation. All hostages develop Stockholm Syndrome. There are some flashes of violence, as you would expect, but most of the book consists of long tender passages about love, tenderness, and a bit too much about opera singing. Without exception, everyone in Bel Canto is obsessed with the opera singer at the centre of the plot. We are told that she sings as if “she was saving the life of every person in the room.” I wish I was more impressed by this.A few quotes:“He believed that life, true life, was something that was stored in music. True life was kept safe in the lines of Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin while you went out in the world and met the obligations required of you. Certainly he knew (though did not completely understand) that opera wasn't for everyone, but for everyone he hoped there was something. The records he cherished, the rare opportunities to see a live performance, those were the marks by which he gauged his ability to love.”“It was too much work to remember things you might not have again, and so one by one they opened up their hands and let them go.”“Maybe there would be a bad outcome for some of the others, but no one was going to shoot a soprano.”"
129,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy,Rating 5 out of 5," I first read Bel Canto in 2004, before I was blogging or on Goodreads, though I was keeping a fairly thorough reading log. The novel was my introduction to Ann Patchett and I have since read almost every one of her books. This is what I had to say about Bel Canto back in 2004:""An international opera star, a Japanese businessman, his interpreter and others are taken hostage in the home of a South American Vice President. The power of music transforms all these people. The hostages as well as the terrorists (who are poor people from the jungle) all undergo changes. Several people fall in love across political and national and even language barriers. It has a surprise ending.Much of what happens is fairly improbable but it is that which makes the book so charming. It is purely a work of imagination. The writing is beautiful with a nice light touch. Completely a pleasure.""I still find that a correct assessment. In 2004 I read it for a reading group discussion at my local library. This time I reread the book for one of my current groups. At my suggestion we made an event out of our meeting. We went together to watch the movie, then gathered at Molly's mom's home to discuss.Most of us loved the book. Rereading it, I loved it even more. Also most of us felt the movie fell far short of Ann Patchett's exploration of the inner lives of the characters. I however, was entranced throughout the film and merely dubbed in what the characters were thinking and feeling because the novel was still brilliant in my memory.Julianne Moore was excellent as the opera singer, though being a singer myself I was not convinced she was actually singing. She was not. She was lip syncing to Renee Fleming who almost made me like opera.In summary, if you liked the novel I recommend the movie despite it shortcomings. It is showing only in a limited number of theaters in Los Angeles so I predict it will not stay for long, possibly not past this Thursday. It is not nearly as bad as the negative reviews would lead you to believe."
130,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1040930-laura,Rating 5 out of 5,"In the hope of attracting foreign investment, an obscure South American country hosts a birthday celebration for an opera-loving Japanese industrialist. They’ve managed to lure him to their third world backwater by luring his favorite soprano as entertainment. The plan seems to be a good one until, during the encore aria, a group of terrorists break through the air-conditioning vents to take the president hostage. The problem is that the president actually stayed home to watch his favorite soap opera, leaving the vice-president in charge — a man, everyone quickly recognizes, who isn’t much of a bargaining chip. Realizing they need to regroup, the terrorists let most of the guests go, keeping as hostages the vice-president, assorted foreign diplomats, the famous soprano, and the Japanese business man and his translator. With police and reporters gathering outside, the terrorists hunker down to figure out how to get their demands met.What follows is an extraordinary exploration of human nature. As this disparate group of people pass days, then weeks, cooped up in the vice-presidential mansion, cultural and political differences are heightened and yet broken down. Unlikely relationships form, dormant talents emerge, and the characters have to take on new roles — some natural, some unexpected. It’s as though being imprisoned in a suspended, alternate universe allows the characters to become the people they really are. Their shared humanity — exemplified by the universal language of music — transcends the circumstance of hostages versus terrorists as well as the differences among the individual characters. You know a situation like this can’t end well, but it’s a beautiful and poignant glimpse into the possibilities that none of the characters, nor the reader, could have foreseen. One of my favorite books I’ve read in the last ten years. "
131,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2266055-daniel-villines,Rating 4 out of 5,"Ann Patchett constructs a setting where people are allowed to grow while unplugged from the burdens of life. In a sense, she removes the training posts from the trees that comprise the initially disciplined characters of the novel. She then allows these characters to thrive without constraint, and they proceed to grow in ways that would otherwise be impossible. This is a very subtly written book. If one could transform her writing into a painting, her brushwork would be finely detailed, to the point where the completed image would be a true reflection of the real life subject. The author develops her plot and characters without bold or overt lines, but the overall meaning is crystal clear. The exploration of love, in its many forms, is artfully woven into the fabric of the entire novel.If there is a shortcoming, it may be in a lack of a preface or foreword to better frame the reality of the setting. My crude attempt would be something like this…Though out modern times, groups of the oppressed have struggled against their oppressors. Somewhere between the extreme violence of a battle and a peaceful demonstration for civil rights, every fight for freedom can be placed and defined. As it happens, the definition of the fight can also be used to define those engaged in the struggle. However, a simple leap of faith by the reader would accomplish the same thing."
132,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2039269-sheila,Rating 5 out of 5,"Someone told me you can’t write a novel without first choosing a single point of view. It’s not true. Ann Patchett’s Bel Canto uses multiple viewpoints to powerful effect, riding musically over events then focusing tight on the tune of a single voice, only to twist and turn away again. Terrorism writ small in the lives of a small group of people; terrorism writ quiet in the waiting game; terrorism where terror recedes and common humanity takes over… this novel paints the characters of a very real world while keeping the details secret, because it’s not the cause or time or place that matters so much as the people.Relationships grow in a microcosm of hope where captors and hostages settle in to eat and sleep, to watch and to learn from each other. A quiet sense of foreboding intrudes like the bass beat repeated with reminders that this settling life must end. The knowledge that any ending’s going to be bad plays a haunting refrain. But the author kept me guessing right up to the final resolution; I hoped as the people hoped, felt inspired by the opera singer’s song, and dreamed a better place.In the end, a book has to close and the world has to be reopened again. The author closes Bel Canto with a curiously convincing confidence, leaving the past still playing in the eaves as the last notes rise and fall in a haunting echo. I really loved this book.Disclosure: A good friend loaned me the book in hopes I might love it. "

I read it at a decent pace, and felt the opening started with a bang. I felt the middle was a tad dull and was hoping for a better build up. Then, I loved/hated the ending. When I say hated, I merely mean I wish it would have ended better, more ""happily ever after"". My heart broke at the end.However, after sleeping on it, I decided to give this book 4 stars, and I think the middle, ""dull"" parts were needed, and actually beautiful. There are over 50 hostages stuck in the house with the terrorists, and they are all different nationalities.

141,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5194069-jenbebookish,Rating 4 out of 5,"3.75 rounded up to a 4.This is my 3rd book now my Patchett. The first book I read by her 'State of Wonder' I absolutely loved. One of my top reads of that year. The next two books, 'Commonwealth,' and now 'Bel Canto,' made for interesting and engaging reading, but they didn't quite match the level of 'State of Wonder.'I did enjoy myself as I was reading, the pacing was a pleasant consistent pace and I never found myself bored or losing interest in one character more so than another. Despite the book revolving entirely around a hostage situation, which one would think would mean that it was all action packed & plot driven, it was in actuality entirely character driven! Based on the real life Japanese embassy hostage crisis, an attempted political kidnapping gets botched at the birthday party of a Japanese diplomat, forcing the would be kidnappers to come up with plan B on the fly. They wind up taking several of the party goers as hostages, including Roxanne Cross, the beautiful and talented opera singer who was hired to sing at the event. What follows over the course of the next several weeks as the kidnappers and people on the outside attempt to negotiate, is a very interesting character study of all the various individuals within and the way each of their dispositions, makeups, psyches and talents contribute to their experiences during the crisis.I really really loved the concepts here, but there was just something missing in the execution for me. It might've been partially because of the fact that I am not an opera fan, and considering that a good amount of the storyline revolved around the opera singer Roxanne's talent and the mesmerizing and uniting effects of her voice, that whole section just didn't click for me. It was actually really hard for me to imagine a bunch of people being held hostage and fearing for their lives and then a person breaking out into some operatic tune and somehow bringing everybody together through this music. If I were to be held hostage by people with guns and a lady started belting out some opera jams, I would 100% be appalled and tell her as kindly and politely as possible, please will you just shut the f*ck up. Now is not the time for singing of any kind, let alone opera . Which is probably why I never found myself connecting with that aspect of the story, which was actually a large chunk of the book which was why it was surprising to me that my overall feelings were not more affected. Aside from that tho I was very much invested in all the various POVs & storylines, and despite having guessed at the inevitability of the ending, it did not make it any easier to swallow when it came. I felt that the impending end to the situation, whatever it may be, gave the story a certain tint of melancholy, & mixed with the actual setting...a beautiful house with a exquisite, lush garden, gave the whole experience a sort of enchanting, dreamy, esoteric feel.I enjoyed this very much and I can understand why it was such a beloved book during it's time, it just did not resonate with me as much as I would have liked. The writing was excellent, and it has been on my TBR for so long I am happy to finally get to check it off the list and I enjoyed it enough to actually make a point of seeking out her other works & any new releases she might release in the future. I might note actually too that whereas most books drop their rating as time goes by and I have more time to sit with my feelings, Bel Canto is having the opposite effect and the feelings that remain are positive ones."
142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1798222-shane,Rating 3 out of 5,"Based on the kidnapping of diplomats at the Japanese Ambassador’s residence by the Tupac Amaru revolutionaries in Lima in 1996 and its tragic conclusion four months later, this book is set in a fictitious South American country where the young revolutionaries hide in jungles, speak Quechua and eat guinea pig — close enough to the Peruvian true story, with the exception of the music...In this account, the diplomats are gathered at the Vice President’s residence in the capital to honour Katsumi Hosakawa, the chairman of a Japanese company, who is being courted to invest in the South American country. Mr. Hosokawa has no such intentions and is only present because Roxanne Coss, a famed opera soprano, is performing in his honour; he has being arranging his business meetings around the world to coincide with her concerts as she is the ultimate in music to him. After the rebels occupy the house, the standoff begins with only the able-bodied male guests and Ms. Coss being held back by the revolutionaries; the others are set free in exchange for various demands that mostly go unfulfilled by an uncompromising government led by President Masuda (ironically, Peru also had a president of Japanese origin at the time: Alberto Fujimori). Communication between this motley cast of characters left behind in the villa, that speak a multiplicity of languages, falls upon Gen, Hosakawa’s translator.As monotonous days flow into weeks and months, the roles of captor and captive begin to blur, new relationships form while others deteriorate, and discipline becomes lax. Hosokawa falls in love with Roxanne; Gen falls in love with one of the revolutionaries, Carmen, as he teaches her Spanish and English inside a pantry cupboard; the generals among the rebels fall to the charms of TV and chess, the soldiers take up soccer in the yard, the Frenchman Thibault cooks for the residents and the Vice President becomes housekeeper. However, it is Roxanne who dominates everyone when she starts practicing her scales every morning; the role of captor and captive invert, for she captivates everyone, including the generals. And when the revolutionary Cesar imitates (and surpasses) Roxanne with his a capella renditions of the operas she is practising, we know that art has subdued violence, and is a more potent force for change. Even the continuous chants of the police outside the gates, shouting, “Surrender,” “Hopeless,” and “Will Not Negotiate” only serve as background music to the developments inside the villa. The omniscient narrator is effective in working like a conductor with his orchestra, bringing up certain instruments when needed before moving onto others. In fact, the entire story proceeds this way, as we move within the claustrophobic setting of a suburban villa and bop in and out of the heads of the main players assembled within its walls. There are often dead spells, when there is little movement, interspersed with occasional crescendos, before we are thrown into the maelstrom of the tragic finale. Only the emaciated bearing of negotiator Mesner foreshadows how everything will end, while the hostages and captors continue to enjoy a harmonious, albeit restricted life. My one beef about this existence is the absence of greed, petty jealousies and political posturing that usually accompany those who live with slim pickings; everyone gets on so swimmingly that I wondered whether this was naivety on the part of the author or deliberately introduced to establish that we can get along with each other despite our differences.What is obvious is that revolution will not breed if people have education, basic comforts and the ability to realize their ambitions, as we see with Carmen learning languages, Cesar learning music, Ismael learning chess, the generals hogging the TV, the Russian Fyoderov and the rebel soldiers having the opportunity to exercise in the yard, and everyone having a great house to live in and a plentiful supply of food for free. Yet, people having a lot of time on their hands and facing the prospect of death reflect on the things they did not do in their lives: Hosokawa regrets not having learned languages, especially English, so that he could tell Roxanne he loves her without relying on a translator; Mendoza wishes he’d made love to more women; Roxanne wishes she had learned how to enjoy life.The postscript of this story comes as a bit of surprise for the tragedy spawns a new and unexpected relationship. It is as if the new lovers are marrying in order to keep alive the memory of those they really loved and lost in the storming of the villa by government troops. It reminded me of the conductor ending his beautiful song, his bel canto, on a suspended note to remind as that art, like life, can be incomplete. "
143,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/545568-elizabeth,Rating 1 out of 5,"I've got quite a few bones to pick with this book. So here's your TL;DR:People behaving unrealistically does not ""magical realism"" make. If you can't juggle a large cast of characters, don't create a large cast of characters. If you're gonna write about music don't just name drop operas, you have to describe what I'm supposed to be ""hearing."" Don't skip or skim over plot points and what little character development you have, show me what happened instead of just telling me after the fact. Speaking of character development, your characters have to start at point A and go to point B for them to develop (I'm looking at you, world's kindest terrorists!).The reason I started reading this is because it's being made into a movie. And I'm going to get a little sacrilegious here and say that the movie has the potential to be better than the book. This was a good idea for a story but was poorly executed. If you are going to ask your reader to believe that literally every character loves and is moved by opera you have to describe what is being sung. Every instance of singing pretty much went like this: it was beautiful, her voice was powerful and went really high, it washed over everyone and they were moved and loved it. Was it happy or sad? Did it make them hopeful or resigned? Don't know. One time the opera name dropped was Tosca which I recall was about a woman who commits suicide. So I guess that aria was probably in minor. (Vague spoilers from here on out, big ones will be blurred)Also there are 60 people trapped in this house but at the end of the book there are really only about a dozen characters. If she couldn't make it feel like there were 60 people trapped in there than she should have just lowered the number. This is another reason I think it could make a better movie. A good actor can take a character that an author has poorly defined, take responsibility for them, give them motivation/physicality/depth etc. There are 20 terrorists and the only thing scary about them is their guns (NOTHING about their characters) and they make in clear right from the beginning that they aren't going to kill anyone. And the less-than-a-handful you know ANYTHING about are naturally gifted and/or kind and sensitive. Every hostage loves opera, every hostage is/falls in love, every hostage is calm patient and resigned to being stuck in the house, nobody plots escape or even discusses or argues about it. In the beginning when the terrorists separate the men from the women to let all the women go NONE of them refuse to leave their husbands. NONE? No older couples who would fight to stay together? No young loves? But I guess all those relationships had to be weak so everyone could fall in love in that house, huh? Ugh. A scene that could/should have been heart wrenching passed with little fanfare which is at best a huge missed opportunity. At another point we're told that a captive and guard (opera singer and carmen) are now friendly. We're just told what they do together now but not shown the first time that happened and how that line was crossed. Considering how boring this book was I would have enjoyed actually reading some of these scenes.Also now that I'm just on a role spewing everything I hated about this book- everyone being completely unable to communicate without the help of the ONE translator was silly. People not learning a 2nd language is an American thing. It's really awkward that the American author thinks this is an everyone thing. In a house full of highly educated businessmen and diplomats the common language would be English. The ending was predictable and the epilogue did nothing to save it. BTW, didn't we establish these characters ages? Isn't Carmen a teenager, Gen in his 20s, and Roxane in her late 40s early 50s? Things I liked: Gen and Messner. But maybe that was only because they stood out.If you want magical realism about people trapped in a building read The Children's Hospital. If you want deeply flawed characters whom you find sympathetic and that confuses and upsets you because the morals are so blurred and questionable read The Bone People."

Bet turbūt tokiu pat statusu kaip skaitau (gal tiksliau nesugebu užbaigt nuo vasaros....) Ozeki ar naująsias Barneso knygas. Maždaug: įdomu, kas vyksta litpasaulyje, bet ne daugiau.""Bel Canto"" skaitosi lengvai, labai gerai įsuka į dramatinį tornadą, bet tai, kas lieka kitapus knygos, ją smarkiai sumenkina.Siužetas: vyksta turtuolių balius, ten atvykusi dainuoja pasaulinio garso sopranas, turi dalyvauti ir prezidentas, tada į namą įsiveržia vietiniai (ispanakalbiai) teroristai - jie ieško prezidento - ir paima visus įkaitais, o tada laiko kokius kelis mėnesius ir patys tame name kartu gyvena.Knygos esmė: parodyti, kaip randasi ir vystosi žmonių tarpusavio santykiai stresinėje, daugiakultūrėje (ir beveik nebylioje, nes praktiškai niekas nekalba kita kalba nei savo - anglų, rusų, japonų, ispanų, prancūzų; tam yra maginis personažas vertėjas Gen, kuris kalba visai visomis kalbomis; kaip patogu....) uždaroje aplinkoje. Kaip reikia tikėtis, galiausiai tie santykiai užsimezga, teroristai susidraugauja su su įkaitais, tampa jiems artimi; užgrobtame name kaip inkubatoriuje ima vykti sau pakankamas, smarrrrkiai idealizuotas gyvenimas. Plėtojasi meilės istorijos, kuriose abi pusės aistringai myli viena kitą. Užduchintas berniukas randa sau pakaitinę šeima - naują tėvą ir dėdę. Mažas teroristukas pasirodo gebantis dainuoti ne prasčiau už pasaulinio garso sopraną ir jau, jos padedamas, fantazuoja apie tarptautinę muzikinę karjerą. Visos tos istorijos paperka, įsuka, tu imi sirgti už tokį sklandų, kone evangelinį žmonių bendravimą ir nori, kad jis nesibaigtų.Visam tam labai padeda tiesiog meistriškai išpildytas daugiabalsiškumas. Akademiniu žodynu kalbant - tai kintantis fokusavimas, kai rodoma vis kito veikėjo perspektyva ar girdimas vis kitas vidinis balsas. Nuo perspektyvos prie perspektyvos Patchett šokinėja tobulai; atrodo, kad ji išmoko mintinai visą Bachtiną, nusibraižė Dostojevskio kūrinių schemas ir dabar visa tai pritaikė savo tekste. Palieka didžiulį įspūdį ir tikrai labai įtraukia.Vis tik skaitant, ypač perskaičius, knyga sykiu ir kėlė kažkokį nejaukumą ar nerimą. Dar iki kol perskaičiau jos priešistorę. O priešistorė tokia: pasirodo, viskas grįsta tikru įvykiu Peru, kelis mėnesius trukusia įkaitų drama ir labai labai kruvina tos dramos atomazga, po kurios valstybinės policijos atstovai iš esmės tapo žmogžudžiais. Teroristai protestavo prieš nehumaniškas įkalinimo sąlygas, kurios, savaime suprantama, labiausiai paliečia žemiausio socialinio sluoksnio žmones ir dar labiau didina socialinę atskirtį. Taigi tai - bet kuriuo atveju, centre yra socialinio jautrumo klausimai, situacija, kuri nėra gera pati savaime ir kuriai taisyti nėra gerų priemonių. (Rašau apžvalgą tą dieną, kai vyksta Tapino aproprijuotas mokytojų protestas ir nors jame nedalyvauju (gyvenu kitam mieste, tai biški galima pabėgt nuo dilemų), iš galvos negaliu jo išmesti. Su įvairiom mintim ir reakcijom, nebūtinai vien kritiškom ar vien palaikančiom.)Deja, Patchett knygoje visas įmanomas / kadaise buvęs socialinis kontekstas ar socialinis jautrumas yra, švelniai tariant, recyclinti ir perdirbti į meilę operai, odę muzikai, kuri tipo suvienija ir teroristą, ir turtuolį korporacininką. Kaip rašė kritiški šios knygos komentatoriai čia, GR, - tai ne tik šiaip nejautru, bet ir dar labiau suniveliuoja žmones į ""all white males"" (šiaip, kai iš įkaitų būrio paleidžia moteris, 80 % likusiųjų tokie ir yra.... išskyrus teroristus, žinoma, kuriuos gal ir galima išgelbėti iš laukinių statuso pasitelkus operą). Kuriems visiems aktualu Puccinni ir Bellinni. Kurie nesupranta kalbos, nesupranta apie ką dainuoja, bet kaip po dieviško apreiškimo įtiki į operą. Kuriems aukščiausia asmeninės sėkmės forma - tapti panašiems į kilnųjį įkaitą, dainuoti operoje, gyventi name su vonia.Visa tai - labai graži ir gera drama, bet tokia - posh drama for posh people. Aišku, tokia yra didžioji dalis popso. Gal tik, kai tekstas labai gerai padarytas ir paveikus, labiau pikta. Tarsi čia būtų kažkokia neteisybė. Gal čia mano pačios vidinis socialistukas rėkia apakęs. Vis dėlto, galvoju, geriausi - man - tekstai būna tada, kai tarp perdėto jautrumo ir perdėto užsimiršimo veikia kažkoks sveiko proto balansas, kai nė vienas kraštutinumas nėra pardavinėjamas, nė vienu nėra spekuliuojama. Net ir operoje ar melodramoje - jei ji gera - tas balansas gali išlikti. Not this time tho."

It was not a choice.”In the vice-presidential mansion in an unnamed South American country, one of the world’s most celebrated Sopranos comes to sing at the birthday party of a Japanese businessman. Before the end of her performance, a band of terrorists descends. Their target is the president, but he is not there, having stayed home to watch his beloved soap opera. Now the partygoers become the hostages. Hailing from 60 countries, they communicate through a gifted interpreter, another hostage, the assistant to the businessman whose birthday brought them together. Days, weeks, then months go by and as the situation becomes increasingly charged and unstable, the hostages - and some of their captors - connect in ways that no one would have imagined.I’ve read four of Patchett’s other books and always felt embarrassed that I hadn’t made it to Bel Canto, probably her most widely-praised and beloved work. My husband has been gently nagging me to read it for nearly twenty years, and for whatever reason, I kept shutting him down, poor guy. “Nope! No thanks! I’m good!” Let’s just say that after reading it, I’ll be paying closer attention to my fella’s suggestions. We finally had our book club meeting last week, twenty years in the making, just us at the kitchen table. I hope he thought it was worth waiting for. Book club, accomplished!Bel Canto is gorgeous, a quietly heart-breaking, wise read. If you can point me towards anyone who writes prose as clear - precise and yet revelatory - as Patchett’s, I’m listening. The way that she slowly peels back the layers to show us these characters is masterful. This book made me think about the human tendency to judge others so immediately, to slide people quickly into categories that reassure us and our sense of how things are. What worlds are inside of each person? What does it take for us to stop and see others, even those who have wronged us (perhaps especially them)? What is left when so much that we count as valuable in our lives is stripped from us, or released by us? The answer this story offers is profound: perhaps everything."
147,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana,Rating 5 out of 5,"Ann Patchett fell in love with her characters, and you could tell that from the beginning. And what she did, I did as well. I'm so happy that Bel Canto and I shared some time together. It was pretty much difficult to say goodbye. I felt bonded with it like it was my friend, as I attached myself with some of the characters very much. It so rare to find a book where you have such a big group of people, on extreme opposite sides and, the middle with no sides, for which you can say that is so essential in finding goodness, compassion, understanding and love for each other. So there was this part in the book where Roxane started singing Puccini's 'O Mio Babbino Caro'  and my eyes were full of tears, as I heard her through my Maria Callas memories from the period when I was obsessed with her. Just to give myself another wind under the wings, I clicked on You tube and I sobbed. I call that perfection, as I adore when some book produces this emotional avalanche. I was feeling this hyper urge to learn more about languages. I added my own personal experience to Bel canto, and it made me feel like there is so much more that you can do with a language, and this book is such a rare gem. There is this basic core, something that we use constantly – verbal communication. And if you know this basic basic thing of more than just your own mother tongue, where is your end? When I was reading epilogue, I felt a bit betrayed, but just for few minutes. Everything that they wanted and loved stayed in that house. Thibault was the only one who was yearning for the outside world, but the rest, they had to find a way to stay within those captured walls and within those memories of joy, strange relationships, forbidden love and passion. I understand perfectly why they did it. They just couldn’t live without those memories even for a day. "

На цій вечірці було багато посадових осіб (звісно) і бізнесменів з численних країн, а також серед гостей була справжня зірка – оперна діва Роксана Кос. Тут розігрується справжня мелодрама, гідна рівня будь-якої опери – заручники настільки сильно здружуються, що вже мало хто хоче, щоб їх рятували. У інтерв’ю про цю книжку Енн Петчетт не приховує, що доводила всі сцени до такого драматизму, який можливий за жанром лише в опері, та знаєте, що можливо сприйняти в опері, важко сприйняти в літературі. Від надто великого драматизму мені було важко повірити в історію. Авторка ввела в історію героя – перекладача, який наче знає всі мови, на яких спілкується ця інтернаціональна публіка, та видно, що сама Петчетт не знає жодної мови, крім англійської, бо коли вона описує цього перекладача, який жонглює десятком мов одночасно, то розумієш, що таке може придумати людина, яка не знає жодної іноземної. До того ж там просто стереотип на стереотипі: якщо французи – то романтики і люблять готувати, якщо росіяни – то з загадковою російською душею “нараспашку”, якщо японці – то сама ввічливість і стриманість.. це вже занадто, чесно… Так ось в книжці ми читаємо про дуже довге перебування цих заручників на території одного простору – обійстя прем’єра. Тут вам і трансформації кожного під впливом співу діви, і спогади героїв про минуле, і спроби взаємодії у ситуації, коли не знаєш мов одне одного. Отже, з хорошого тут: ідея! Ідея показати, яку трансформуючу силу має мистецтво! За неї я б поставила 5. Навіть ідея з поданням роману за законами опери мені теж сподобалася. Але ось втілення цієї ідеї могло би бути більш живим і правдоподібним. Тому за загальне виконання я поставила трійку."

It is a comical situation, a bunch of amateur terrorists enters the vice-presidential mansion through the air conditioning ducts, their target is the president, who did not attend the party (because soap operas are so much better than birthday parties). So now they are stuck with hostages that they didn't really want. Things go awry, and there is never a happy ending for holding hostages under your wing. There are colorful characters in the house, the Soprano opera singer, and Russian, Italian, and French diplomats and a priest (one always needs a priest if you are in a house with terrorists). And it is a Tower of Babel, where so many people speak so many languages, but can't understand one another. Luckily, they also have a translator there (that knows pretty much every language existing).But, and that is a big but here, while this is all amusing, it is not well executed. The writing is very detached, very far removed in my opinion, so I didn't find myself caring about any of them (let's say that with terrorists you are supposed to be afraid that your favorite character is going to be shot or thrown away from the roof for negotiation). In addition, the ""frightening threatening"" terrorists part was so short and quickly disappeared and the closeness and friendship between the hostages and the terrorists came quickly to full blown relationships (that is no Stockholm Syndrome, just pretty normal friendship). I would say that the interesting thing would be to see this gradually happening, especially with a real Stockholm Syndrome, and that is quite clearly not a real part of this novel. 3 stars, great idea, less than average execution. "
150,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12840458-kalena,Rating 5 out of 5,"Fiction; first read by this author. Why can't all books be this good?!? I simply loved this book. One of my favorites of all time. The characters, the plot, the setting, the study of human behavior--whatever Ms. Patchett served, I devoured and wanted seconds. From the love of music and the relationships between characters (especially Mr. Hosokawa and his interpreter, Gen) to the conflicts that abound in a hostage situation. Who has woven a tale about terrorism and love so deftly? I am already excited about rereading this novel and gleaning new insights into a masterpiece that I savored and repeatedly lost myself in. My highest recommendation.Upon my second reading, this remains one of my top ten books. The insights and perspectives throughout the book just strike me in such a profound way. It may be the emotional archaeologist in me--how the characters, both the terrorists and the hostages survive together. I felt such attachment to these characters. How this illustrates that we may find love or at least understanding for all people if we knew their story. Also, my deep affection for language in its many forms is highlighted here in wonderful ways. Will continue to reread to be captured myself. P.S. Sadly, I found the movie to be terrible--they changed or left out so many wonderful moments and do not expect any of Patchett's remarkable character development. They turned this brilliant novel into muck. *Heavy sigh* Dear Hollywood, please quit doing this! Please do not let the movie deter you from the novel! "
151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/834122-travis,Rating 2 out of 5,"I wanted to like this novel; I really did. And I didn't hate it, so I'm giving it two stars instead of one. The premise was very promising, but the execution left much too much to be desired.I am willing to suspend my disbelief for the sake of fiction, but this was not at all believable: months and months and months of terrorists holding hostages with no significant intervention from the government? the terrorists taking no significant action to have their demands met over all that time? the government unable to devise a plan to overcome basically 3 adult terrorists and their teenage ""soldiers""?And the pacing of the novel, to be blunt, was simply boring. The climax: it was horrific. ****Spoiler Alert**** The massacre of the terrorists at the end was, granted, quite realistic and what one would expect from a 3rd-world government. Yes, it was exceedingly depressing, tragic even. Patchett, however, attempted to toss her readers a proverbial bone in the epilogue by having Gen and Roxane get married. No! This made no sense at all: none. It seemed terribly contrived. It would have been far better to end the novel with the massacre and then just a brief epilogue telling the readers what had happened to the surviving hostages, but the marriage of Roxane and Gen: yet again, Patchett strays into the realm of--even for a work of fiction--the incredible.Bel canto? No, mal canto."
152,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3126915-imi,Rating 3 out of 5,"An intriguing premise and a fantastic opening sequence, but maybe I am just too cynical for everything that followed. I think above all I was disappointed by the character development. Considering this unusual group of characters are locked up together for 6 months, I was suspecting some surprises, conflicts or something... Instead I don't feel that I really understood many of the characters' motives or behaviours, and the improbable love stories all felt contrived and forced. There was also no other way the novel could have ended. It was predictable, but tragic and had to happen sooner or later otherwise the book would have gone on forever. I would have been reasonably satisfied with this ending, but then Patchett decided to write a sort-of epilogue and I really wish she hadn't. It was unnecessary, unbelievable and really a bit laughable. Still, parts of the book were wonderful: Fyodorov's story of his grandmother, Thibault longing for his wife, Father Arguedas' feeling of duty and of course the reason for the president's absence from the party (brilliant!). Maybe if there had been more focus on these thoroughly more believable secondary characters than on Coss and Hosokawa's relationship, then I would have liked this a lot more."
153,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9110769-elaine,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a lovingly written book. I was taken back by the skillful way in which the author integrates love into every fiber of the book: love of child, love of a spouse, love of a home, new love, long term love. All forms of love are skillfully exhibited while the book goes about the more serious way of describing a misguided attempted kidnapping of the President of a country. Instead, the kidnappers end up with a spectacular opera singer and almost 50 people to take care of. The story itself is a well known story, a story that is often resolved in a single dramatic episode of a drama show, or extended a bit into a movie. The skillful writing and careful unfolding of each facet of the tale is what allows the book to seeringly leave the reader both wondering what happened to the characters after the book is done, yet content that the story would go on. "
154,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9429655-luce-cry-baby,Rating 5 out of 5,"Rating: 5A moving tale in which language is key. Patchett's lyrical prose vividly renders a – somehow – surreal situation by focusing on the mundane: we see terrorists and hostages take part in ordinary everyday things (such as cooking, listening to music, playing chess...). A whimsical and absorbing story where characters albeit being limited by 'language' found other means through which they can understand one another. Patchett confines a diverse cast of characters in a restricted space thus creating all sorts of interesting relationships. The tone of the novel is somewhat light: plenty of subtle humour is found in the most tense moments. An atmospheric and moving novel that beautifully conveys a complex – and very dangerous – situation. "

So, I almost hate to rate this one as I do not know whether my opinion is a true one or whether it is caused by my slump. Was I distracted because it didn't capture my attention? Or, was I distracted because I am easily distracted lately? Ugh. I really do not know.So, for now I give it 3 stars. The writing was good though I really didn't love any of the characters. I didn't find myself rooting for any of them in particular. I wasn't enchanted. Maybe one day I will read this one again and have a different opinion, but for now it is a totally average book which doesn't linger in my mind."

I'd say this is much like life in general. In Psalm 119 we ask G-d, ""Avert my eyes from seeing futility"". So that is what happens in this book, the people avert their eyes from seeing futility and we are engaged in an unlikely world of life.This book is absolutely stunning, it is almost perfect, and so so sad. I must reserve judgment on the epilogue because in tragedies the survivors do have to continue to live and that is a tricky and tragic business all on its own."

It is a very character driven story that examines the human condition under the excruciating stress of being taken hostage. Now while I can certainly understand that some readers might feel dissatisfaction regarding the way relationships evolve between the victims and the villains I would state that it was a necessary step for Ann Patchett to end her book in the way she wanted. An ending that I felt was bittersweet and at the same time a satisfactory conclusion to the story.

(Please hold onto your gasps.) And I was not disappointed. In an unnamed South American country, an extravagant birthday party unfolds at the home of the vice president, celebrating an influential Japanese businessman. Roxane Coss, the world’s most celebrated soprano, has been invited to perform for the vast array of powerful international guests. However, the serene atmosphere spirals into disarray when armed terrorists infiltrate the party, hoping to kidnap the president. With the president absent, the terrorists hold the partygoers hostage, hoping to negotiate their demands.Based on a real-life incident in Peru during the winter of 1996/97, Patchett delivers her trademark fantastic characters, rich with a diverse range of depth and complexity within a balanced narrative. Drawing inspiration from the incident, Patchett overlaid a situation that frees up space for her characters to shine. Through a third-person narrator, she masterfully navigates the various vignettes and milieus, moving around the tension-filled house.While the ending felt a bit rushed, it remained true to the underlying plot points and themes, so I don’t fault it there. The only thing that really didn’t work for me was the epilogue, strangely disconnected, somewhat muddying the drama it followed.But I found the heart of Bel Canto in its exploration of human adaptability, intricately woven throughout the novel. As creatures of change and prisoners to time, we are bound to navigate our ever-changing landscape, adapting and progressing in the face of adversity. Patchett skillfully illustrates this human resilience, not only through her characters' actions, but also through the tapestry of languages spoken and the operatic music sung in the book. As her characters move beyond their roles, Patchett cracks the façade of the terrorists and softens the steely compliance of the hostages, shifting the dynamics in the most human of ways.Audiobook, as narrated by Anna Fields: Fields did a phenomenal job of handling the narration for Bel Canto. Not only was her reading voice sublime, but she found a way to project the feeling of both moving inside the story and weaving in and around it, delivering a dynamic performance."

Tak jak w fenomenalnym ""Domu Holendrów"" niby nie dzieje się tutaj nic wielkiego, ale och, jak bardzo nasycona uczuciami jest to powieść. O muzyce, o pięknie, o językach i miłości do innych światów i kultur, o operze, o sztuce, o celebrowaniu codzienności, o przewartościowywaniu swojego życia ze względu na zupełnie niespodziewane okoliczności. (Jasne, jest tutaj też atak zakładników i wątek polityczny, ale kto by się takim czymś przejmował). I okej, możliwe, że ""Belcanto"" działa na mnie tak mocno przez moje tegoroczne doświadczenia, które, mimo że skończyły się dla mnie lepiej, niż kiedykolwiek mogłam podejrzewać, udowodniły mi raz na zawsze, że mimo iż czasem myśli się o tym, jak nasze życie będzie wyglądać za pół roku, zazwyczaj popełnia się wówczas totalną pomyłkę. Możliwe, że jestem przez to nieco nieobiektywna... ale hej, w końcu to moja recenzja.Bardzo podoba mi się to, jak delikatna jest opowieść Patchett. Niby zaczynamy tutaj od ataku terrorystycznego, brania zakładników i innych wątków rodem z kina akcji, ale już po chwili całość staje się o wiele bardziej wysublimowana i delikatna, opierając się na emocjach bardzo wyraźnie zarysowanych bohaterów, a nie na konkretnych wydarzeniach. I mimo że w ostatecznym rozrachunku całość staje się zaskakująco smutna, to och, jaka ładna i czuła jest to powieść. Trudno jest mi opisać jej fabułę, żeby nikomu nic nie zepsuć, podejrzewam też, że wielu osobom (jak dowodzą recenzje na Goodreads) po prostu się nie spodoba - bo będzie za wolna, zbyt skupiona na psychologii bohaterów, zbyt mało fajerwerkowa. To jest jak najbardziej okej, ale dla mnie jest to jedna z najwspanialszych opowieści tego roku."

But in this case I just want to close the door on this book. I really did not like this novel, and no one is more disappointed (or surprised) than me. I am a new Ann Patchett fan, having devoured two of her books this fall and I pledged to read through her books in their entirety this year. I had very high hopes for this one -- the premise sounds so intriguing, I was excited to see what Patchett did with it. The book has been out long enough that most readers know the plot, but this is the story of a hostage crisis - not a dinner party, but a HOSTAGE crisis. And yet, there is absolutely nothing in my response as a reader to evoke that emotion. I was so incredibly bored. Patchett loves opera and as a reader I felt as though she used that to try to force some social commentary and it felt very heavy handed. The characters were very flat, the writing felt choppy, and I just kept thinking ""this would NEVER happen!"" I understand this is a work of fiction, but there is no way anyone would behave the way these characters did given the situation; it was a ""Pollyanna"" hostage crisis. I assume her goal was to take a life altering event, show the goodness of the ""bad"" people and teach the ""good"" people some lessons. Didn't work for me."

I loved all these different people and how they lived peacefully despite the hostage situation. They became an odd sort of family who grew to deeply care for and love one another. One could argue that many were suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, but the characters were painted as neither good nor bad, just human. So many shades of gray.(I just learned about Lima syndrome, the opposite of Stockholm Syndrome, which was coined from the event that this book is based on, in Lima,Peru, 1996. It’s where the captors felt sympathy for their victims. I’m going to read more on what happened. I have some vague memory of hearing about how the government killed the terrorists while they were playing soccer.)It’s quite remarkable how people can come together in the most dire circumstances. And I wanted so badly for it to end well for ALL of them!This was my second Ann Patchett book and I’m excited for more. (Also, being in quarantine and reading about others who are trapped inside is very relatable!!! 😬)A beautiful and haunting story, like an aria echoing in the night."

I didn't really know what to expect from the summary and all I could think was, 'How can a hostage situation last 300+ pages and remain interesting?' The pace was a bit slower, but I enjoyed the way the relationships developed between the hostages and terrorists. I enjoyed the way the characters learnt about themselves and grew as people the longer they were in the house. I especially liked Gen and Ruben Iglesias. I did not like the epilogue.

Was the South American nation the only one unnamed? Was it to avoid embarrassing a specific country because of the disparaging way people referred to it? By not naming it all of them are named. It came off as a poor and unnecessary choice to make. The first thing I noticed about this book was how beautifully Patchett writes. She has such command of the language. She pays awed attention to the beauty of the details in a moment and in turn so to the characters and so does the reader. I love that in writing: careful appreciation of the things we often do not notice. This knowledge of human emotion and artistry of writing carried me through to the end.And then came the second thing that bothered me. The Epilogue. It jutted out awkwardly from the rest of the book."

This hostage situation is based on a true story, and I felt the historical bits could have been developed further. Why doesn’t Patchett mention the name of the country at all? Just descriptors like “jungle,” and “south america”…. The hostages knew where they were, so why didn’t the reader??Next, some of the romances needed WAY more development. If you’re going to have two characters fall in love, who don’t even speak the same language as one another, at least make it believable. Especially if one of them is going to commit adultery!!!

When living in Nashville, I used to visit her bookstore ""Parnassus Books"" whenever I was in the Green Hills area (highly recommended if you are ever there!!!). However, I could never quite get myself to read one of her books, so THANK YOU San Diego Book Divas for adding Bel Canto to your list!! Now the book. I want to give this a 3.5. This story is beautifully written and I liked it, I just had a hard time keeping engaged in the plot. For a story about a hostage situation (inspired by the 1996 Lima Crisis), it's rather subdued. The hostage event starts off in the typically chaotic, violent mess but then settles into an almost utopian like housebound life where both sides just settle into their fate. This idealistic hostage life is mostly due to the lovely operatic singing of the lovely Roxane Coss. Apparently, she's spell-binding. This is where the story was lost on me because as much as I love good music and understand the need to hold on to something beautiful during a crisis, opera is just not my cup of tea. I did enjoy the interrelationships of the hostages and terrorists. Patchett did well showing that all ""sides"" are human beings. "

For a long time. I've never read anything by Ann Patchett and her other works are immediately going on my TBR list. Her writing style is beautiful in it's simplicity. It sang the same way Roxane Coss did.This is not a thriller, as it was so poorly advertised to be upon release. It is barely even a drama, as one would typically think. Bel Canto is a microstudy in emotional intelligence. ""Based on a true story"" is a very, very loose statement here. The real hostage takeover in Lima did not involve women, did not involve a famous singer, and I'm sure was not so pleasant. But that's not at all the point. Patchett's complex weave of character interactions are based around the question: ""What do I find myself to be when all I have are others?""Roxane is a world-famous soprano. Mr. Hosokawa and Kato are internationally-respected, wealthy businessmen. Gen is an awe-inspiringly intelligent multi-lingual translator who built his world around his mind. Ruben is consumed by his political career. Beatriz, Carmen, Ismael, Cesar, are all practically kids who were sucked into the business of rebellion by men who alleged to know more about the world. The generals are fueled solely by the injustices of government. What happens when these people lose their societal functions? What happens when their careers and social statuses fail them? What do they do when their life must revolve around the cadence of personal relationships, instead of accomplishments or money? This story happens.I was so excited to read Patchett's take on all the varieties of love as presented in this story, and not all of it romantic. Mr. Hosokawa has a romance with Roxane that is built on mutual admiration, respect, and common interests. Yet Mr. Hosokawa has also placed Roxane on a pedestal, has turned her into a goddess, and is fully aware that what they have is transient - it is not real. It is real only in the context of the moments they have between 2 and 4 am. It is love from a Greek Goddess to a mortal that can be sung about for ages but not replicated. And he is ok with that.Mr. Hosokawa and Gen also present a love story, albeit platonic love. The bond and devotion between the men is only revealed in the most dire circumstances, but grows their friendship to the height of ultimate sacrifice. Mr. Hosokawa loved Gen more than he loved Roxane, as proven by his final act of self sacrifice. Mr. Hosokawa wasn't trying to save Carmen. When he was trying to save Carmen's life, the real person he was trying to save was Gen.Gen and Carmen's romance is one of first love. Their eyes are open to the world for the first time. Every second of their being is turned towards the other. Their passion is reckless in the face of the circumstance. It's the kind of love to think of at age 80, longingly but not painfully. Even love without a person on the other side is represented. Beatriz finds God. Ceasar finds self-worth. Ismael finds family acceptance. These are embodiments of love; of special relationships that can make one whole outside of their career or social function. Every moment of self-revelation was beautifully told.Lastly, yes, Gen and Roxane have an accurate representation of love. I understand that a lot of readers hated this ending, with Carmen and Mr. Hosokawa dead and Gen and Roxane married when the dirt has barely settled. But hear me out.More often than not, love does not have pure motivations. It can be propelled by a need to fill a void in one's own self image; the need to care for or be cared by another person; the need for social acceptance; the dependence on routine and the comfort of avoiding change; the need for an emotional anchor outside yourself. Gen and Roxane had real love, but love that was built on a foundation of grief. They married in grief. It's a form of love, but a desperate and shifting form. One that won't last. I know in my heart at the end of the epilogue that Gen and Roxane had pure intentions on their wedding day. I also know that neither of them was thinking of their newly-minted spouse, but the ones they already buried. I'm positive that their marriage fell apart; as their grief morphed over time (because grief never disappears, only changes clothes), the foundation of their love cracked and crumbled.And I'm ok with that ending. That, to me, is an accurate representation of some marriages. Some traumas. Some self-reflections. Some loves. Ann Patchett wasn't writing a thriller or even a scene she wanted you to believe. She wanted you to find out what you would love if the world wasn't looking at you."

I definitely could have done without that epilogue. I was so upset about it, to me it didn’t make sense. The ending was captivating, it moved so fast and I was definitely crying while listening to the audiobook. The book reminded me a bit of Luis Buñuel’s “The Exterminating Angel”. It definitely had an element of magical realism to it. I can definitely understand what people love about it but it didn’t captivate me. Pratchett is definitely an amazing writer, she’s very descriptive and her words are lyrical and poetic. I met up with my IRL book club to discuss this book and it was the first time that no one liked the book. It still made for an interesting conversation and there were definitely elements of the book that were liked. The overall consensus was that is a bit overrated....Bel Canto tells the story of a birthday party gone wrong. There is a hostage situation, days stretch into weeks which then stretch into months. The goodreads summary states that “time stands still, priorities rearrange”. Ican definitely attest to the fact that for me time stood still while I was readingit. I was honestly thinking when are you going to get to it Patchett. There was an artificial feel to the book. The setting was there to try to make me feel something when there was nothing to nurture those feelings for me. The read didn’t have tension, these people were in a hostage situation for months but you would have thought they’d gone on vacation. The character development that should havehappened during this course felt superficial. I wanted to know more of the backstory of the “terrorists”. The characters were very two dimensional. There was some backstory snippets given to them but definitely not enough....I would still recommend this read because there were definitely times when I fell in love with Patchett’s writing. She definitelyhas a way with words and can set up a good story. I just have a problem with her characters. I liked her characters but I wanted more development. I wanted more from them and I didn’t get it.  So overall, this was a ⭐️⭐️⭐️ for me."

This is one of those books you instantly like or dislike, I think. I couldn't give this one less than a 4 because the descriptive prose here was floating on so much lyricism, a savoring read. Some books you read to get to another scene, plot, turning point, pivotal moment, etc...some books you read to savor. This was such a book. One setting: a vice president's home. Characters: party invitees, diplomats, rich businessmen, rebel soldiers who hold them hostage. Main character: lyric soprano who is apparently a beauty (Or is it her singing that all the men seem to be enthralled with)? The entire book centers around these characters held hostage. What Patchett does well is develop and introduce her characters by revealing the inner workings of their minds; the subtleties. Not too many writers can accomplish the omniscient narrator so well. The characters all have the love of music and of one woman in common, yet Patchett calls to attention themes of misplaced love, the perspective of impending death, second chances, and cultural commonality.My issues: About 150 pages in, I wanted to know more about the kidnappers and some of what was going on on the outside (we heard from one character about it--for approximately one or two pages). Throughout the book, I was mortified that the South American country was never named (what)?! And the ending? Not my favorite."
179,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9750143-bookofcinz,Rating 4 out of 5," Updated- August 13, 2018 I read Bel Canto six years ago and I remember thoroughly enjoying it. It was the first novel I read by Ann Patchett that led me to fall in love with her writing. While I remember giving this book five stars 6 years ago, I down graded a bit to four stars this time around. That is not to say it was bad, I just wasn't as moved as I was six years ago. In Bel Canto we open to an opera performance by a world renowned singer at a birthday party for a high ranking official from Japan. The lights go off at the end of performance and we are greeted with guns and terrorists. What transpires next is a hostage situation with persons from different background and languages. The terrorist group main aim was to kidnap the President and overthrow the government, but the President wasn't in attendance so that led to the Terrorist having to re-evaluate their plans. What was supposed to be a grab and go hostage situation turns into a month of negotiating and holding the hostages at ransom. During that time, we learn more about the hostages and the persons they captured, we almost fall in love- or maybe I got Stockholm syndrome... but needless to say, the book ended and I had ALL the feels.  A beautiful, well written novel that hits you directly in the feels.  May 27, 2012 Well written, a must read. First novel Ive read by Ann Patchett and I am pleasantly surprised. Awesome novel."

There were times that I wasn't sure whether I liked it or not, it's almost like an acquired taste and it took me some time to appreciate the subtlety in the writing.On the surface, this is the story of a group of people who attend a party, some with not the best of intentions in accepting the invitation and then finding themselves in the middle of a terrorist plot to kidnap the President of the country who was supposed to attend but at the last minute canceled as he did not want to miss his weekly soap opera.The story takes place over the 4 months that the guests are held hostage in the home of the Vice President and the relationships that develop between guests who did not know each other at all before the night of the party and the hostage-takers is really complex and interesting.As I kept reading I really began to appreciate the writing and the individual stories of all the various characters and found the ending to be a rather unexpected twist.A good book, worth investing the time to read slowly and absorb."

I have read other books where the universal power of music was celebrated, but I felt like this book worshipped the music, the singer, the song. And I just didn't get it. The terrorists seemed buffoonish and ineffectual, and the hostages are so calm and collected. With one sweeping vibratto, the soprano controls the house. Miraculously, there is morning tea and girlish laughter, love bursts into flower and peace reigns for a hundred pages before the guillotine drops and blood covers the streets. But wait. Before you stop caring, there's an epilogue! Reminiscent of a fanciful fan fiction lovefest, Patchett marries people off with blissful abandon. I was disappointed. I feel like she's such a talented author, but I still haven't been impressed. Her writing style is excellent, but her plots and characters need some umph. Should I give her one more try?"
183,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62181206-daniela,Rating 3 out of 5,"3.5*This was a truly wonderful book. The writing is rather good and completely suits my personal taste. The characters are believable and well built. There's a certain abstractness that owes a lot to magical realism - you don't know exactly where the action is set, or even the wider political context surrounding the plot. And indeed, those aren't really very important questions since the story unfolds perfectly well without them. The author avoids unnecessary clichés. In fact, one senses how easy it would be to let the whole narrative fall into a massive cliché. And yet it doesn't: Patchett gives us to reasons to care for the characters, to feel for their plight.The epilogue was, admittedly, a little bewildering, but the novel remains a very enriching reading experience."
184,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/773729-kelly,Rating 4 out of 5,"It's funny because I found myself, like the characters in the book, trying to forget about life after and outside the hostage situation. Ann Patchett tells you on the first page that none of the terrorists are going to survive. And, because I became so invested in the characters I spent the rest of the book trying to forget that little fact...which is exactly what the characters in the book spent so much time doing - forgetting that they were actually ""terrorists"" and ""hostages"". Pushing away the thoughts that told them something would eventually happen to bring that to an end. They became so emotionally attached to each other they got very good at denial."

The expectation of pages turning rapidly as we draw ever closer to a nail-biting conclusion. However, Patchett foreshadows how the hostage situation will play out early in the book. With this knowledge, the book becomes more of a character study and an exploration of Stockholm Syndrome. But I didn’t feel particularly engaged with any of the characters or their stories. There were so many of them and perhaps this was the problem. Patchett can write beautiful sentences, but I was never really drawn into this story emotionally. And the epilogue felt wrong."

Since I am a huge fan of Ann Patchett's newest work, such as Commonwealth and The Dutch House, I was fully expecting to fall in love with what people proclaim is her best work yet. God, with all of the hype around this book, I really did not expect it to be such a let down to me. It still has a lot of the common Patchett literary elements, primarily a character driven story.One thing that I think sets apart this work from the ones that I have read is that it takes place over the course of four months, told in a chronological fashion. Previous novels I've read have spanned over numerous years and jumped from one time point to the other, which is what kept it so interesting to me. I am gonna be honest, I did find myself bored a lot of the times sitting through this book. I was sitting here waiting for something to happen because it felt so dry. Sorry, I forgot to tell you what this book is about. Fatigue, you know??? A bunch of politicians and high-class super wealthy people all gather together at a party where the Italian president to be. And there's like a famous singer performing there to so there's that. Some terrorists come in and take over, and they planned to kidnap the president, but the president wasn't there, so they just held everybody hostage for like 4 and a half months. Yeah. Dry. I wasn't even clear as to why these people wanted to kidnap the president, but perhaps that requires knowledge of history? Or maybe I didn't pay enough attention.As time passes by through their hostage state, the terrorists and the hostages start making friends with each other. I am literally falling asleep as I write this, so I don't think this makes much sense. But I guess the moral of the story is wow! We are all the same! Humanity <333. I thought that was cute, yeah sure whatever. But the epilogue bullshit made me so mad. It just jumped a certain period of time into the future and pulled some shit out of nowhere. I am mad. I am upset. What the fuck was that, Patchett? Why do people call this your best work because I love you. I literally love everything else you do. But not this one lol okay hahahaha goodnight!!"

Grupa gerilskih militanata provalila je u japansku ambasadu i zatočila stotinjak visokih dužnosnika. Talačka kriza trajala je nevjerojatnih 126 dana.Važno je napomenuti da je Ann Patchett ovaj događaj uzela tek kao inspiraciju, i od njega stvorila priču po vlastitom viđenju, priču koja na meni nesnosno prelijepi način koketira s magijskim realizmom, a zapravo je nježna priča o ljudskim odnosima, umjetnosti, suosjećanju i ljudskosti.U sam centar svoje priče Ann postavlja jednu opernu pjevačicu, najveću svog vremena, istinsku umjetnicu velike karizme. Operna diva Roxane Coss počasna je gošća na političkom eventu u nekoj neimenovanoj zemlji Južne Amerike, a pjeva u čast jednog japanskog poslovnog čovjeka koji obožava operu i Roxanin rad, kojemu je rođendan, i ta mala zemlja mu se pokušava smiliti ne bi li Japanci uložili u industriju te male zemlje.Roxane jedva da je dovršila svoj kratki nastup kad na event upadaju teroristi i otimaju cijelo društvo raznih dužnosnika iz cijelog svijeta koji uopće ne govore jezikom jedni drugih. Talačka kriza traje mjesecima i polako se među njima stvaraju odnosi, bliskosti, čak i ljubavi. Sve ono što se ne bi trebalo stvarati u situaciji koja možda traje u nedogled, ali sigurno neće završiti dobro. Jer iz tih odnosa, bliskosti, čak i ljubavi nisu isključeni ni vojnici koji ih drže na nišanu.“Nikad nije ni pomislio, ni jedan jedini put, da takva žena uopće postoji, osoba koja stoji tako blizu Bogu te se iz nje izlijeva sam Božji glas. Koliko je duboko morala unići u sebe da bi ga prizvala? Činilo se kao da glas dolazi iz samog središta Zemlje i da ga ona pukim naporom i snagom izvlači iz blata i stijena, te se probija kroz drvene podnice do njezinih nogu prožimljući je, a ona bi ga hvatala, dizala i zagrijavala, te bi se potom oslobađao iz bijelog ljiljana njezina grla i uspinjao ravno do Boga na nebu.”Zaljubljena sam u način na koji je autorica osmislila magijski realizam i mistiku u ovoj priči. Oni gotovo u potpunosti proizlaze iz čarolije glazbe i ljudskog glasa kao najljepšeg i najčarobnijeg instrumenta – pjevanje kao duhovno iskustvo. Taj glas čarobni je sastojak koji polako ohrabruje priču da ode u smjeru koji je izuzetno zadovoljavajući. I ta magija, kako to obično i biva s magijskim realizmom, postavlja neka svoja pravila po kojima funkcionira ova knjiga.Prvi dio knjige pomalo je spor i strpljiv, lako je odlutati mislima, ali autoričino pisanje je fokusirano na cilj koji postane jasan negdje u posljednjoj trećini knjige. Odnosi koji tada postanu vidljivi nježni su i osebujni, karakteri su divni i životni, njihova komunikacija postaje nepredvidljivo kreativna, a autorica veliki trud ulaže u propitkivanje ideje alternativnih ljudskih sudbina – što bi neka osoba mogla postići samo da je rođena u drugim okolnostima, pod nekom sretnijom zvijezdom?“Kad samo pomislim što smo sve izvanredno mogli učiniti sa svojim životima, samo da smo znali kako!”Iako o samom epilogu knjige doista ne znam što bih mislila, kraj glavnog dijela priče bio mi je vrlo… dojmljiv. Oh, kako li je samo bio dojmljiv! To je sve što ću o tom kraju reći, vama će sve biti jasno jednom kad knjigu pročitate, a rado vam je preporučujem.Po meni, ovo je čarobna knjiga s velikom, iako intimnom, pričom. Za strpljive je čitatelje koji vole iščitavati između redaka. Predivne je atmosfere i prava je oda opernoj umjetnosti, odnosno, prava je oda magiji koju svaka umjetnost u sebi nosi. Mene je istinski oduševila."

In my College Prep class for seniors, they were charged with choosing titles from recommended reading lists to work through and reflect on. I inherited the list, and as a first year teacher with three preps, I wasn't in a hurry to change things I didn't need to. Time and again students were choosing Bel Canto, and then recommending it to their peers, and I regularly read their responses on it. I intended to read it someday, and it looks like it only took me fifteen or so years.Bel Canto starts with an assorted gathering of wealthy, notable people gathered in a South American country for a concert in the Vice President's residence. Terrorists arrive, intending to take the President captive, but when he's not there, the situation grows beyond their scope and the situation goes on, unresolved, for months.The book demonstrates the fluidity in relationships as extended time together blurs roles and separations.

This book threw unlikely characters together in unusual circumstances with multiple native languages and the ensuing communication issues. It had an irregular pace (an hour could take pages and then a week or more would pass with a sentence). It had obvious foreshadowing of the fate of some characters (""when he thought of that day later..."" I guess he survives). I was 16 pages from the end of the book and could not see a satisfactory resolution. And yet when I closed the book, I took a deep sigh, and realized that the only possible conclusion had been reached after all.

I thought, perhaps, that it was a story about the opera. Imagine my shock when the the story begins with a dramatic hostage situation in a South American vice-presidential home one night in the middle of a private party for a Japanese delegation.The bel canto reference is for the opera singer, Roxane, engaged to sing at the party. Her voice personifies the musical definition of 'full, rich, broad tone and smooth phrasing'. She has the entire party in her thrall, including the future terrorists hiding in the walls waiting to spring out and begin the hostage drama.Patchett subtly explores the Stockholm syndrome that ensues.Full review here - http://bronasbooks.blogspot.com/2019/..."

209,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10706354-kevidently,Rating 5 out of 5,"Is Bel Canto one of the best books I've ever read? Quite possibly. Last year, Patchett's The Dutch House immediately became one of my favorite books. Do that once and it's a wonderful fluke. Do it twice and it's a pattern. I am now a major Ann Patchett fan.It's so hard to know how to describe this book. It begins with a botched terrorist takeover of a birthday party held in vice president's home of a host country that remains unnamed. Somewhere, it seems, in South America. The birthday party is for Mr. Hosokowa, opera fan, and the guest of honor is Roxane Coss, beloved opera singer. The other guests are luminaries from a clutch of nations: Russia, Spain, France, America, Japan, more, and s the situation settles and this disparate group of people remain together for longer and longer, an unexpected camaraderie develops. Not just amongst the hostages against their captors, but often between hostage and captor. To say this feels trite. You could say Stockholm Syndrome, and I'm not entirely sure you're wrong. But the care and love that develops out of this bizarre and unexpected situation feels so natural, so right, that it resists simple analysis. At the center of this whole story is Gen Watanabe, the translator who works for Mr. Hosokowa, and his elevation from side character to the beating emotional center of the book. For the time spent in the vice-president's mansion, life becomes something of a dream. Sometimes a bad one. More often not. Every character changes, and almost every one for the better. They discover new compassion, new talents, sometimes so unexpectedly that it takes us a moment to catch our breath before we accept it. But we do accept it.Which is out mistake, even though we cannot help it. We're told at the very start of the book how, in general, it's going to end. But near the end of the book, Patchett discusses the type of forgetting those in extreme circumstances sometimes retreat into. One character forces themselves to forget the person they're in love with is a terrorist. Multiple characters forget that the people they're thinking of as schoolchildren are their captors. Music, which is at the center of this book, does not stop this situation; it only changes it. We forget all of this because we fall in love with everyone in this book. And that's why it's a tragedy. Because we know what's going to happen and we care anyway. And that's also why it's a brilliant novel. One of the best I've ever read. "

Since the novel is set in one place and time, it allows exploration of relationships and people. Music becomes a common language and bond for hostages and captors alike. The only thing that kept it from 5 stars was the ending. It was unsatisfying. I’m not sure what would’ve been a better ending but this one wasn’t it. Listened via Libby"

It's not such a bad thing, being loved for what you can do.""Soon enough the days were divided into three states: the anticipation of her singing, the pleasure of her singing, and the reflection of her singing.This multi-award winning book from Ann Patchett (winner of both the Orange and PEN/Faulkner prizes) is a somewhat odd mishmash of opera and a hostage crisis. It's a meditation on the solaces of art and love, and the simultaneous strength and fragility of both. It doesn't always quite work-although I can't put my finger on why-but I can't find it deserving of less than four stars. The story takes place in an unnamed South American country (it was inspired by the Japanese embassy crisis in Lima, Peru in 1996.) It opens when a terrorist group invades the home of the Vice President, who is hosting a dinner party for a gathering of local and international businessmen and dignitaries. Attendees at the performance include a Japanese CEO, lured there by a performance from his favorite singer, opera legend Roxanne Coss. The intruders' plan is immediately thwarted when they discover their target, the President, has bailed on the event at the last minute. Having no plan B, the terrorists pare the group down to the male dignitaries of various nationalities, a priest who refuses to leave, and the soprano Roxanne. And then, months pass in a hopeless stalemate with the government.As time passes, an odd alchemy develops in the house. No one forgets that there are soldiers and guns, but mutual interests in chess, soccer and opera form friendships. Roxanne begins giving daily concerts that become a fulcrum of joy and beauty for all parties, including those gathered outside of the house. Romances develop, all the more passionate for being doomed. Some of the younger soldiers, children really, begin to wish and believe that they can stay in this stasis forever--living in this rococo mansion with beds and lavish bathrooms. One child takes singing lessons. Another plans to be adopted by the Vice President. There is no world outside of the house for the reader or the characters. Once a character exits the house (the wives, the Red Cross negotiator), their story drops away. What the characters want isn't so crazy. As the reader you know better, and yet you read the story hoping irrationally that they can all just stay there together (at least, those that want to.) If they could all just somehow find happiness and respite there, in this odd oasis of art and companionship that makes no sense except somehow it does. I guess the story does have wisps of magical realism, as some claim, but I think it just as easily celebrates the rare and impossible to recreate chemistry random groups of people can have. When I was in Syria years ago (long story. No, I'm not a terrorist), my roommates and I took a bus home from the University one day. In my memory, the bus was painted like the Partridge Family's, but maybe that is just a trick of remembrance. Everyone on the bus was so happy. The driver sang to us. I gave my seatmate a mint and the container got passed around while everyone yelled the Arabic word for mint, ""Nana"", in delight (I lost the one tin of Altoids I had brought with me, but it was totally worth it.) We got off and everyone yelled, ""Goodbye, Americans!"" We never saw or rode that bus again. Crazy, wonderful things just happen sometimes. You just appreciate the magic and ephemeral nature of them while you are living in them. **Just to be clear, there was no hostage situation on that bus. Unless you want to count my Altoids. **Syria is a wonderful country with an asshole government and an asshole would-be occupation force. Please keep them in your thoughts. **A book about the solace of art could not be more well chosen at this moment in US history. **Opera is an interesting choice as the unifying force here as it's such an, uhm, acquired taste. I can't say I'd be that excited about an opera concert every day. But I guess if you're a hostage, you don't have a lot else to do. "

222,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/931455-dorothy,Rating 5 out of 5,"In an unnamed host country, somewhere in South America, a birthday party is taking place at the home of the vice-president. It is a party in honor of a wealthy and successful Japanese businessman, who the host country's government hopes will make a sizable investment in that country.The Japanese businessman is an opera fan; one might even say an opera nut. In order to flatter and please him, the host country has brought in a world famous opera singer, Roxane Coss, to entertain at his party.Many people from the diplomatic community are present at the party, but one guest is missing: the country's president. The president's great passion is not opera but soap opera. He is enthralled by a particular soap opera that is on television daily and then has a nighttime episode on Tuesday that provides a roundup of the whole week's story, and he stayed home on the night of the party to watch his beloved soap opera.Nevertheless, the party proceeds successfully. Roxane Coss sings her arias to great acclaim, including one especially beloved by the honoree. As she finishes her last song, the lights go out in the house and a band of terrorists who have entered the house through the air conditioning ducts burst into the room and take all the partygoers hostage.The terrorists' plan is already a failure, though, from the outset. Their plan had been to kidnap the president who they believed would be at the party. They would then force him to have certain people released from the country's notorious prisons. Without their intended hostage, they determine to hold the male guests and the famous soprano, while they release the rest of the women and children who were in the house.A Red Cross representative comes to the house to try to negotiate a settlement, but neither the terrorists nor the government seem interested in any kind of good faith negotiation. Instead, the terrorists and their hostages settle into a kind of routine. As the weeks pass and the stalemate continues, they grow more familiar with each other, alliances and friendships form across lines, and, most unexpectedly, some fall in love.The standoff continues for months and finally the Red Cross representative warns the ""Generals"" in charge of the terrorists that no progress is being made on the negotiations and that things will end badly for them. He urges them to surrender. Still they are unwilling to give up their demands or their hostages.I found Ann Patchett's writing to be utterly compelling and beautiful. Like the soprano she writes about, she shows great range, filling her story with flashes of unexpected brutality and terror, followed by long stretches of incipient ennui as the hostages and their keepers settle into a boring daily routine, and finally bits of humor, as well as subtle insights into the nature of desire and longing and the growth of love. Moreover, the characters are superbly drawn. The premier cast includes Mr. Hosokawa, the Japanese businessman, and the world-class soprano Roxane Coss, and Hosokawa's interpreter, the polyglot Gen (pronounce with a hard G) and a female terrorist aptly named Carmen. There are many languages represented by the guests and Gen is kept constantly busy interpreting and helping them communicate, but, in time, they learn to communicate almost without language, through the music, the games they play (chess and soccer), and French cuisine.But, in addition to the four main characters, all the other terrorists and hostages are also beautifully described. They become real human beings for us and we long for them to be able to continue in the happy state which they achieve after a few weeks of their enforced intimacy. Throughout the book, however, we have a sense of dread that things will not end well for these people and, indeed, they do not. The only thing that I did not love about this book was the epilog. It was most unexpected and seemed a lamentably inappropriate conclusion for the story that had gone before. In spite of that ending, I still found the story amazing."

226,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7036662-bookslut,Rating 4 out of 5,"**spoilers**This was a two-star read for almost the entire book, and I thought it was a beautifully-written book that I would push through without ever being glad I was reading it. It gave me this antsy feeling. Fred and I have talked about how we are two different kinds of museum viewers. He wants to read every plaque and learn something about each exhibit. I kind of just want to breeze through hall after hall of curiosities, and skim. And when I go to a museum with a Fred-like person, I get so antsy, to keep moving. That is how I felt in here--I saw that the whole book was going to be set in this house with the terrorists, and I wanted to just get the body count and a one-paragraph summary and keep moving. This probably is the wrong kind of book for me. If it is full of really careful, really beautiful writing and slow pacing, I want there to be a strong plot or to connect with it somehow. I don't want to hang out forever with a bunch of interminably lovely words. So, a bad fit. But, but-but-but-but. I was wrong! Because then at the end, she did this masterful thing. See, right at the beginning, she tells you all the terrorists are going to die. This causes you, as a smart reader, to immediately build a wall to protect yourself from ever becoming too vested in anybody holding a gun--which doesn't seem hard, bc they're the bad guys, and they're not that charismatic anyway. And for 2/3 of the book, that was no problem. I was bored, but I knew who the good guys were, and I was waiting on the end of the incident. But somehow, even though she's warned you and you're practically ready to finish it, all of a sudden you care so much! I didn't even really notice it happening, and then I was utterly devastated by what I knew was coming. There is one moment, where the Vice President holds Ishmael's head in his hands, that I felt a genuine sob well in my chest. I think there was even a physical tear, which was last preceded (I think) by a very moving vampire novel in seventh grade. And I'd never even really realized I wasn't stil waiting for it to be over. Now a lot of people talk about the ending of this book, and by that they mean the epilogue, and people say you either love it or you hate it. My reaction, I think, was worse than either of those: it felt insignificant. It's obviously designed to provoke, but I was unprovoked. I think it was a mistake, definitely, but not even because of the (questionable) choice she made, but simply because nothing could rival the scene before it. She should have left it alone, or added a non-provoking epilogue, because this one left me completely unmoved. As a side note, the ending of her other book I've read ALSO had a very provoking ending. And that seems dangerously like a schtick, a predictable, formulaic cheap trick, and I would tread carefully in the shocking endings for a long while if I was Ms. Patchett."

It's not to be consumed in fast food fashion; it's for gourmet buffet. It's not hustle and bustle; it's stop and smell the flowers. Every page is filled with lyrical prose that needed time for me to digest. There were moments when I had to reread paragraphs not because I couldn't comperehend the first time but because I wanted to relish every word, every nuance, every metaphor.The rich characterization and thoughtful dialogues I read and loved in The Dutch House are both present in Bel Canto, and in this book, I was even more drawn towards the characters regardless that they are numerous. The plot moves along like opera indeed: suspenseful, dramatic, humorous, smooth, bel canto.While some critics consider Bel Canto as pretentious for being based on a tragic real life event, I consider it as affirmation of Ann Patchett's skillful storytelling for she was able to create colorful characters that I could not help but sympathize with and to make music as its central theme. A very memorable read.4.5/5 stars."

229,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1377720-deborah-edwards,Rating 4 out of 5,"This is a small miracle of a book. How a book about a hostage situation in a South American country can be so tender and filled with such marvels of human observation is still a surprise to me. The hostages, who consist of a famous American opera singer, a powerful Japanese businessman, and a host of attendees from various countries who speak diverse languages, all come together (through a four and a half month stalemate with the government) to form a small, self-sustaining, and eventually beneficial unit. There is one translator who acts as a conduit of verbal communication between the various hostages, but otherwise they are left to their own devices to coexist with any understanding of each other, and the book shows us the many forms of communication that can exist between people, as well as the many words that can hold different meanings for each speaker. Love is one of these words; happiness is another. There are so many different ways in which we love and so many diverse scenarios that can represent true happiness. The hostages become aware of this in ways they never imagined. They begin to form a bond with their captors, and through it all the group shares the unifying power of music as a central theme of the story. The opera singer becomes almost a metaphor in and of herself for the best part of the human spirit. Juxtaposed against the violence of society and the social inequalities of the world at large, we view a microcosm of that world and see the utopia possible when a group comes together in acceptance. Of course, utopia is a conceptual entity and we know as we read this story that eventually the world will be showing up at the door to try to knock that utopia down, but I, for one, kept stubbornly ignoring that fact, the way the hostages do, happy in my self-delusion as they were in theirs. And ultimately, this book requires that we decide for ourselves whether or not we know what love is, whether or not we know the meaning of happiness, do we believe in the goodness of people and embrace all that is good in the human spirit, do we accept the differences of others, and is there truly hope for us all.

Although I felt that the Epilogue was not the strongest part of the novel, the rest of this story is lovely. Wound around themes such as the passage of time, religious faith, what it means to be literate, and especially the power of art, beauty, and music to change our lives, Bel Canto (which translates to ""beautiful singing"") is an enchanting view of what it means to be human under trying circumstances. Opera and classical music have been in my home once childhood and the thrill of sitting in an opera house as the orchestra warms up and the light dim is palpable delight at its best. Consequently I was surprised at how the author, who admits to only recently beginning her admiration for this art form, is able to make it sound so authentic and integral to this story. Without a retelling of the plot, I will state that the book actually reads like an opera on many levels. Katsumi Hosokawa recalls how his life forever changed after his father took him to see Verdi's Rigoletto as a child. From that point on, ""There was nothing more to want than the privilege to sit and listen."" His favorite recording star is Roxane Coss, modeled on lyric soprano Renée Fleming. Pachett's descriptions are at times, exquisite: ""Her voice was so pure, so light, that it opened up the ceiling and carried their petitions directly to God. It swept over them like the feathery dusting of wings, so that even the Catholics who no longer practiced their faith, and the non-Catholics who came along because there was nothing else to do, and all those who had no idea what he was saying, and the stone-cold atheists who wouldn't have cared anyway, because of her singing they all went away feeling moved, feeling comforted, feeling, perhaps, the slightest tremors of faith."" 200. As Roxane exults, ""who did not feel the joy in such music?""This book contains so much to examine (references to music abound), to savor and contemplate that it has earned a spot on my bookshelf. "
231,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5819312-sheryl-sorrentino,Rating 5 out of 5,"Bel Canto is a touching and intelligent tragicomedy delivered by a colorful cast of quirky characters. An exclusive birthday party for one Katsumi Hosokawa is hosted by the vice president of a fictional Latin American country. In attendance are a potpourri of international diplomats and business dignitaries. The feature entertainment is the great opera diva Roxane Coss, who has everyone under her spell—until the vice president’s mansion is taken over by a pack of guerrilla terrorists whose aim is to take the president hostage. But the joke is on them, because the president elected to forego this shindig in favor of staying home to watch his favorite telenovela, Maria. A hilarious premise to kick off this delightful adventure.Ann Patchett weaves a gripping tale of broken barriers and unlikely attachments. Few of the characters share the same language (they communicate through the birthday boy’s translator and right-hand man, Gen). And yet, they all understand Roxane Coss’s irrepressible language of music. You can practically hear the operatic notes rising from the pages. Over time, both the hostages and their captors come to understand a deeper, quieter language than words—the immediacy of the here and now; of interdependence and play; of seizing each and every moment. And then, connections, affections, and unspoken understandings that took months to cultivate are torn asunder in about two minutes in a climactic and bittersweet finale. (I could have perhaps lived without the unlikely epilogue, but hey, nothing in life is without its flaws.)I probably would have never picked up this book had a friend not recommended it and passed her copy along, but I am so glad I did. Patchett’s sparse, evocative writing and decidedly perfect pacing—despite the stationary setting—make this unusual story a top-notch work of fiction. "
232,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/321673-jamie-collins,Rating 3 out of 5,"I liked the narrative style of this, and the characterizations are charming. However, it’s almost unbearably saccharine and sentimental. This story, about terrorists who kidnap dozens of people and hold them hostage at gunpoint for months, could be made into a TV movie and shown on the Hallmark Channel.It takes place in an unnamed Spanish-speaking third world country. Terrorists invade a dinner party populated with a multinational array of wealthy executives, politicians and diplomats, plus one famous opera star who everybody keeps falling in love with. The terrorists are fierce locals, bristling with weapons, but they’re rather at a loss when their Plan A falls through. As the kidnappers and kidnappees coexist, the magic of music pierces their hearts, relationships break out everywhere, and it’s all heartwarming, and then predictably tragic at the end.The whole thing is slightly surreal, but I had one particular nitpick: I refuse to believe that people are universally mesmerized by opera. The original party plausibly included a large number of opera fans, but it seems to me there should have been at least one person in this story who wanted to wring the singer’s neck after enduring her hours of daily practice. That would have broken the spell, though, and the book is about people reacting to a severe break in their reality as if they’ve been enchanted, or transported to a fantasy world."

I kept postponing it because the premise seemed so off-putting: a gathering of elite international guests are taken hostage in an unnamed banana republic (a small South or Central American country, not the store). Yet once I resolved to get past the grim set-up I was swept away by the author's subtle, inventive and ambitious tale of the Stockholm Syndrome run amok as guerrilas and prisoners work out a way of living together over a period of months while trapped in the vice president's mansion. The book is remarkably (and happily, in my view)apolitical; the story is all about human nature and how it transcends language and culture. The common ground that does bring this unlikely group together is music, and although I prefer the middle-brow Broadway musical form to the more refined opera that touches these souls, still I could feel the passion behind the passion. The book starts surprisingly slowly, considering how many assault weapons are involved, and there are side trips into various characters' pasts that will bore some. But I'm very glad I finally got it off the shelf; I'm a better person for having read it, if not ready to run for office."

I found this book a rather tedious exercise as it took me forever to get through it because it never grabbed my interest until about the last 50 pages. I kept waiting for an ending that would lead me to consider the book a good read, and I was let down. And although I enjoy opera, I could not for the life of me understand this utter adulation for Miss Roxane Coss - the opera singer and only female hostage in this story - especially as the author did not convincingly describe or flesh out this character, in my opinion. Overall the characters were uninteresting (except for Gen and Mr. Hosokawa). To me, the characters came across more as caricatures than real life people, and they might appeal to a group of students during a book study, but they were not authentic enough for me to enjoy. The premise of a stately vice-presidential residence filled with hostages and their captors for months might have been a genius idea to start with, but how the author tackled this, felt surreal – and maybe that was the author’s intention all along? Still, I want to give points to the author because although I often got bored with this book, I will not easily forget it."

The first paragraph drew me in and I really enjoyed the writing and the characters. The situation was really interesting too. It wasn't anything too heavy or deep, just entertaining and a good story. I was actually interested enough that I had one of my rare nights of staying up until the early hours of the morning to finish it. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the ending. I don't know exactly how I would have wanted it to end, but I know I wasn't satisfied with the way it did. I don't write books, but I can imagine knowing how to wrap things up would be one of the hardest parts, and in this case I just wasn't happy with how it was handled, but it's hard to knock the book too much when it kept me interested and turning the pages. I also found myself laughing out loud in the middle of dramatic situations. There would be something funny come up that lightened the tension and I enjoyed the humor. So all in all, a pretty good novel for just escaping into for awhile."

When a birthday party is held in an unnamed South American country, a famous soprano opera singer sings at a birthday party in honor of a visiting Japanese industrial titan. The party is interrupted when 18 terrorists enter the vice-presidential mansion in hopes to hold the president hostage. Unfortunately, the president never showed up because he was watching his favorite soap opera, defeating the purpose of the terrorist visit. Instead, they hold the people from the party hostage to try to get their demands met and what develops are unexpected relationships between the party guests and even the guests with their captures. The book developed the characters well, but I felt hostage too when the plot did not drive itself forward enough for me. If the book had been scaled back in pages, I would have enjoyed it so much more. That said, it read more like a play to me than a book as this is such a character-driven piece all taking place in one setting. I would recommend this one for readers who love slow builds and rich characters. "

My book club had read it before I joined the group and all but one woman raved about it. My first exposure to Ann Patchett was reading State of Wonder, which I enjoyed, so that was another reason for high expectations. But I found myself being rather bored with Bel Canto. The plot plodded along and eventually the cast of characters (both victims and captors) form close bonds. Amongst those characters, I found the few women to be rather two-dimensional and undeveloped. For instance, everyone loved the diva for her voice and petite loveliness--but WHO WAS SHE REALLY as a person?? The two pretty women were loveable and admired; the one homely woman was disliked or generally ignored. And finally, as so often happens in plodding books, the ending when it came happened in an instant, and that was followed by an epilogue that was startlingly unbelievable.

I recently read some reviews of her other books and asked around regarding which ones people had loved. But I didn't get any ""loves.""

I have had ""Bel Canto"" on my to-read list for more than 10 years. Why it took me this long to read it, I don't know. But sometimes a reader needs to be ready for a book, and I think that's what happened here. I was in a place where I was ready to appreciate how finely crafted this book is. An unnamed South American country. A birthday party for an influential businessman, featuring an acclaimed opera singer. And then terrorists arrive. And then the guests become hostages. And then the weeks pass. This book is no generic exploration of the Stockholm Syndrome. Every single one of the characters - terrorist or hostage - is human. And it is their humanity that Patchett captures so masterfully. I have always admired Ann Patchett, but with this book I understand what a genuinely significant American writer she is. "

I read it shortly after it was published; so I really needed to refresh my memory. For my first read I enjoyed it, but wasn’t gung-ho for it. Several things make it a difficult book to read: there are many characters, and it is “dense.” By that, I mean the paragraphs are long, often filling an entire page. For this reading, I listened to the audio while following along with the ebook. That helps me so much when there are names that are not English. I really enjoyed this second reading. Since I was leading the discussion, I did a great deal of additional reading about the book and also the author. I came to really respect the author.

Speaker: And are you prepared even if it costs you your life?  Tamino: I am. In December of 1996, members of the MRTA seized more than 400 guests at a diplomatic reception at the residence of the Japanese ambassador in Lima, holding them hostage for more than four months. Peruvian Special Forces rescued the hostages in late April of 1997, killing all 14 insurgents, one hostage, and two soldiers. Bel Canto looks more closely at what might have happened during the standoff, changing my perspective, at least, of both rebels and hostages. This is the story behind the story, the story that I will think about as we read the news (these are people). In this version of the story, the kidnapping occurs at the Vice President's home during a birthday party for a Japanese businessman. The guests/hostages were Japanese, Russians, Germans, Americans, Swedes, citizens of the unnamed country where they were. The ""gift"" that pulled this reluctant attendee to the party was Roxanne, a famous soprano. Everyone adored her voice – and her: It was as if the voice came from the center part of the earth and by the sheer effort and diligence of her will she had pulled it up through the dirt and rock and through the floorboards of the house, up into her feet, where it pulled through her, reaching, lifting, warmed by her, and then out of the white lily of her throat and straight to God in heaven. It was a miracle and he wept for the gift of bearing witness. (p. 54) The rebels are part of the fictional La Familia de Martin Suarez, named after a child killed by the government's soldiers. They have the moral high ground, wanting to draw attention to the brutal Peruvian prison system and to free their jailed friends and family members. The real Peruvian prison cells are dug into the Andes along a network of tunnels; the rooms have ceilings too low for prisoners to stand and move around. (I have been struggling with what language to use to refer to the kidnappers. Rebels? Guerrillas? Domestic terrorists? This is a point of view, reflecting our biases and politics rather than accurately seeing the group's dangerousness or intent. If the Vice President had broken into the house to kidnap the President, it would have been called a coup.)When we live closely with others and begin to see them as people, we gain empathy toward them and are transformed by them (e.g., Patty Hearst's experience when kidnapped by the SLA). This empathy is sometimes dismissed as Stockholm Syndrome. The rebels, mostly born in the jungle and illiterate, are exposed to and awakened by opera, chess, French cooking, soccer, and languages. The hostages are transformed by friendship and love with both each other and the rebels, new views of who they are and how they want to live, and finally discovering happiness. They learn that work isn't everything. Roxanne is loved and adored, and several men proclaim their love for her, the only female hostage. One Russian needed nothing more than the opportunity to tell her. Another, released because he was ill, refused to leave her (and died in a diabetic coma). Another followed her around, although they did not share a language. But, do they love her? Can they love her when they don't share a language with her? ""If someone loves you for what you can do then it’s flattering, but why do you love them? If someone loves you for who you are then they have to know you, which means you have to know them” (p. 224). Carmen and Beatriz were never identified in the papers after the rebels were killed and the hostages were released. The inconvenient parts of stories are edited out – that two of the ""men"" were women, that the rebels were human and by no means dangerous. They were not a danger to anyone and did not need to be killed. Both my mother and best friend told me that they'd read Bel Canto years ago. Both were neutral about it. Bel Canto left me sad about the ways that those in power objectify and waste oppressed peoples, about all of the lost possibilities in our lives.This is an autobiographical story from Ann Patchett that my mother sent me.

263,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13493599-jim-elkins,No Rating,"When Novels Are Too ComfortingThis book has a strong and consistent tendency that is both unusual and, for me, strange: the author has the desire to comfort everyone, both the reader and the characters. This isn't just because the narrative is a hostage situation. The desire permeates the implied author's choices and descriptions. It matters that the hostages are as comfortable as possible: one has a tiny pillow, another loosens her hair, a third rests on her husband's shoulder. They all get bathroom breaks. This interest in comforting, consoling, and assuaging extends to inanimate objects. One character worries about pipes in his house, even though he doesn't own it. The narrator (who is near-omniscient, but ""focalized,"" as Genette says, on a number of characters) even tells us that the wonderful carpet is safely cushioned by a pad, so it won't be unduly worn by all the gunmen and hostages.There's an equally consistent and heartfelt need to tell readers how mesmerizing, how sheerly beautiful, women can be. An opera singer hypnotizes one character after another. A servant's beauty makes a man forget his pain. Intimacy and quiet are important; people whisper to one another nearly inaudibly in Spanish, French, and Japanese. The opera singer's voice is heavenly, to everyone with ears, which means almost everyone worth describing.At first -- around page 20 -- I thought that this authorial nursing would make it impossible for anyone in the novel to suffer or die, but then -- 10 or so pages later, and so very early in the book -- I realized that one of the author's principal purposes in writing is to provide a glow of reassurance over everything and everyone, to illuminate life with an aura of maternal love. What a strange purpose for a novelist. It isn't exactly sentiment, although it is often very sentimental: it's more a kind of unassuaged need to show that things and places as well as people can be nurturing and nourishing, good for you to contemplate.This desire feels like it was once an anxiety, before the author began to write, and that she healed herself by writing. It's as if the calm and warmth of the prose need to be continuously renewed by narrative. If I read through the narrative, as it were, to the anxious state of mind that I imagine might have impelled it, then I'm interested; but I am not convinced by an author who wants to console me at every minute: it's like being in the company of an overly solicitous, determinedly optimistic nurse.(This is not a complete review. I only made it to page 89. So much reassurance: by p. 81 there is a death, but we're told in many ways it was for love, and then we're told how that love was reciprocated, not only by one person, but by an entire crowd of people, who somehow understood what was happening even though they spoke a variety of languages; and we, the readers, are reassured that everyone appreciated and was inspired by the love they witnessed.)All this made me wonder what the opposites of ""Bel Canto"" might be. ""Bel Canto"" consoles and cares about every doubt or anxiety a reader might have; what books disregard their readers' doubts? One of Patchett's opposites would be Beckett, who can sometimes want to tell us over and over that things are hopeless. Or writers like Houellebecq, Capote, or Ellis, who often want to remove consolation. Those names come to mind because they are authors who set out, in a way, to do the opposite of what Patchett does. The norm would be narrative that sometimes consoles but typically doesn't, that sometimes shows how people care and are cared for, but generally doesn't. If, as a reader, you don't feel any special pleasure in being continuously reassured, or if you find, as I do, that this continuous solicitous care, the relentless comforting, raise questions about the person who needs to administer that care, then this book may seem less calming than disturbing."
264,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9572229-georgie-who-is-sarah-drew,Rating 3 out of 5,"Every now and then, I venture back to literary fiction. And more often than not, I wonder whether the authors of LitFic wouldn't be better off immersing themselves in the craftsmanship of what gets called (pejoratively) Genre Fiction. ""Bel Canto"" (at its simplest, a hostage drama) is a case in point. It is written predominantly without dialogue. There are snippets of speech, of course, but Patchett's style is to observe omnisciently and to report thoughts and conversations through indirect speech.""The doctor closed his eyes and gently wagged his head from side to side in a way that would attract no attention to himself. Whatever would happen would happen. The stitches would neither save the man nor kill him. That card was already played and there was nothing to do but wait and see the outcome."" She observes very precisely, and with an edge of humour.""His face was such a remarkable assemblage of colors. The very blue of his eyes, the very white of his skin, red where the sun had burned his cheeks and lips, the yellow hair which was the color of the white corn Gen had seen once in America. He was all primary colors, Gen thought. From such a face any beginning was possible.""Patchett uses multiple POV narrations, pushing the reader constantly to zoom in here, zoom out there. I think her intention is to foster sympathy for all participants in this high-stakes situation. That certainly happens, but it is at the expense of real engagement. The overall effect of so many POVs, with so little dialogue, is one of detachment, of being kept at one remove from the characters. GenFic's concentration on 1 or 2 POVs tends, IMHO, to be better at immersing the reader in a tale. Patchett, on the other hand, gives readers a microscope and invites them to watch characters perform like bugs on a slide.One of the other characteristics of GenFic is the way characters drive plot—very often by the bad decisions they make. (That's not the exclusive preserve of GenFic, of course; The Mayor of Casterbridge is only one example of how LitFic uses this.) But for me ""Bel Canto"" falls into the trap of making characters' actions ultimately pointless. The situation of the hostages and terrorists is such that they cannot influence to any real degree the outcome of the siege. What they do while they wait for a resolution has no bearing on the resolution itself. True, Patchett offers beauty & acuity in describing their lives, observations, conversations, burgeoning relationships, but again, it's in the manner of one waiting for a bus while taking an idle interest in others in the queue.I'm glad I read this (not least because I'm a bel canto fan anyway), and I enjoyed Patchett's mannered style. It just didn't provide the integration of plot and character I admire in other books, and so it was ultimately unsatisfying.NB Annalisa's review is excellent on the real-life background to the hostage-taking.Also, a gorgeous cover by Roberto de Vicq de Cumptich (https:// www. devicq.com/ publishing).

Terrorists barge into a birthday party for a prominent Japanese businessman in South America under the rouse of possibly helping the small community financially. Mr. Hosokawa, however, is there only to hear the operatic voice of Roxane Coss, the famous soprano. The story winds and turns, without any violence and minimal demands, as it is learned that the terrorists are, for the most part, young boys looking for the release of a few prisoners; there are two girls sprinkled in for good measure. Predictably, yet, beautifully, Roxanne and Mr. Hosokawa, who do not speak the same language, fall in love with the help of Gen, Mr. Hosokawa’s translator, who falls in love with one of the female captors. There are several other undercurrents of love; the love for music, the love of chess, the love of running, the love of parent and child.The book is nearly over, and 4-1/2 months into captivity, when out of the blue, the army, or anti-terrorist team, swarms the house and kills all of the terrorists, including the translator’s love interest and accidentally, Mr. Hosokawa. On the next page, the last page, the translator and the opera singer get married; they state they are in love. The end.What?! I reread the last page twice and still don’t understand what happened, or for that matter, why it happened.Oh. My. Gosh. I don’t remember being so disappointed in an ending for as long as I can remember reading. Seriously. Boo. So, why then would I recommend the book? Because it is wonderfully written and a remarkable, touching story of love. The book leads us to look at love in a different light. It is fresh and unique, though not a page-turner, and is quite entertaining. (Except for the ending, of course.)"

I feel totally wounded, emptied, and bereft. The only thing I can really say is that in real life I realize there is NO way this group would have been allowed to stay together for over four months! (Although Patchett's initial motivation to write this began with a true story of a four-month hostage siege in Peru in 1996. So I guess this could happen...) That would prevent the attachments and bonding that developed among the various characters in this novel.I just don't know. I guess I should rate this highly because it did what Patchett meant to do. But I can't say I like it... This is one I will definitely research further in the aftermath of having read it. Update: Patchett did mean to do exactly what she did. And I get it, it will just take awhile for me to accept the ending. The ending is realistic, IMO. Though it was lucky that only one of the hostages was actually shot, IMO. I expected more of them to accidentally die in the final attack. This does prove what I've found to be true, though in very different circumstances, a group of strangers can indeed become friends and develop interpersonal relationships that might initially be thought impossible. We are all human, after all, and music is definitely an across-cultures/across-languages language of its own. This is the next day and I'm feeling better about this, but the ending was so jarring...after getting to know these characters so well and then having ""real life"" insert itself into the circumstances and watch so many of them die..."

Constatado que o Presidente não compareceu à festa, forma-se um impasse. Era de se esperar que, dando tudo errado, o sequestro proporcionaria situações de tensão na casa, mas Ann Patchett constrói essa narrativa focada nas diferentes e inusitadas relações interpessoais que se formam no período de cativeiro. Dias se tornam semanas; semanas se tornam meses; e o marasmo toma conta da casa...e da narrativa. O assunto do momento passa a ser uma partida de futebol, o desenrolar da novela ou os embates de xadrez.

To be honest, this book drags. It's also surprising to me how much I wasn't invested in the story given that historically I love character driven books. While it certainly had elements that made me smile or gasp there was just too much that I didn't enjoy. I did not like how almost every man in the house is aroused by the opera singer at all, which surprised me given that Ann Patchett strikes me as a strong female author. I was also weirded out by (spoilers) the interaction between Gen and Cameron. It feels like sacrilige to say that and maybe I've misunderstood it but a relationship between a 17 year old and a man in his early twenties just doesn't do it for me (I sound like a prude but I'm 17 so I feel like that at least helps). I recognise that the exceptional circumstances means most norms are thrown out the window and that the relationship is loving and wonderful but something about it man, *shudder*. With those especially harsh criticisms a three star rating probably looks weird, but I did enjoy the demonstration of human resilience and the depiction of the terrorists as people themselves. I think this book has a lot of lovely elements but it does not live up to the praise I have heard and I probably won't be jumping to recommend it to others unless there are elements of it I know they will like.

However, around 2/3s of the way into the book, something clicked and I Got It. I think a good foundation had been laid for me up until that point and I’m sure bread crumbs had been dropped for me that I was choosing to ignore but the book just began to speak to me!

I just think this book is such a good meditation on how we, as humans, with completely different cultural backgrounds and multiple, large language barriers would react and interact when forced to live together in one house, trapped for months. It’s fiction but it’s also very real to me, because I DO believe art would be the connection between us and we WOULD all individually discover what is actually important to us and we would spend each day doing things we were BORN to do, which would be discovered by sitting around all day with nothing else to do. Oh Ann I will never doubt you again I swear.“The dead we can imagine to be anything at all. My brothers and I were all excellent observers. Some people are born to make great art and others are born to appreciate it. Don’t you think? It is a kind of talent in itself, to be an audience, whether you are the spectator in the gallery or you are listening to the voice of the world’s greatest soprano. Not everyone can be the artist. There have to be those who witness the art, who love and appreciate what they have been privileged to see.”"

It doesn't focus on ransoms or standoffs. It's written in third person omniscient so the reader sees inside the minds of many of the hostages and their captors, and this is how the reader develops empathy for each one.I felt like this fact flooded over me throughout the book: we are all the same. No matter where we are from, what language we speak, how educated or affluent we are, whether we are good guys or bad guys, we are the same. We love, hope, laugh, and sing.We sing. One of the hostages is an opera singer and the captors and hostages are all equally (almost magically) mesmerized by her singing. Music is infused into every page of this book, which is why it is called Bel Canto, or ""beautiful singing.""I will be honest and say that I wasn't gripped by this novel until maybe half way through. I don't feel like I attached to the characters as much as I wanted to. But I can also say I will always remember this unique, intriguing book and I'm so glad I read it.Bel Canto is Ann Patchett's fourth novel, published in 2001, and loosely based on an actual hostage event that took place in Peru in 1996. It won several awards and will be a movie in December starring Julianne Moore.As far as content goes there are some sexual situations and obscenities. A few crude parts and f words but they were not a major part of the book. "

It's not such a bad thing, being loved for what you can do.''But the other is better.''Better. I hate to say better, but it is. If someone loves you for what you can do then it's flattering, but why do you love them? If someone loves you for who you are then they have to know you, which means you have to know them.”A group of terrorists/rebels take over the house of the vice president of a South American country, including the vice president and all his guests. They planned to kidnap the president but he was not there (he preferred , at the last minute to watch a soap opera instead). Now they do not know what to do, as kidnapping all these people was not their plan. The star of the evening is a famous opera singer who was performing at the party.The terrorists are mostly young boys with 3 “generals” that are older and they basically do not want to harm anyone and are actually not sure what they want.At this stage, the story develops into a comic/dramatic/pastoral path where the people (who are from all around the world and speak many languages), get used to the life in captivity and a special relation forms between the captives and the captors and between the captives. Many of the captives and captors find the situation in the house fulfilling and actually do not want it to end.This is a story about love:Love of musicLove of lifeLove to the country/people (as manifested by the sacrifice of the terrorists)And some incidents of romantic love between men and women and other types of love between people .I enjoyed the book, it is brilliantly written and has beautiful descriptions and insight"
272,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4401739-michelle,Rating 5 out of 5,"5 minus. Okay, I really like everything I have read by Ann Patchett, except that she really pissed me off at the end of State of Wonder and again in Bel Canto. However, I really loved all but the epilogue of Bel Canto so I am just going to rate it as 5-.Bel Canto is a story of terrorists and hostages. Not my normal genre. Until you realize that the story is not about the act of taking the hostages and all the torture you figure you will encounter with this storyline. Instead, it is the story of the relationships between the terrorists and the hostages. I really enjoyed the way each character was portrayed and developed throughout the story. The story focuses on many of the terrorists and hostages throughout the book. Some you come to care about, some are just there to facilitate the story, but the reader will surely connect with several. My biggest complaint was the Epilogue. I hated it. Also, I felt the ending was rushed. I wish that Patchett had included more detail during the ending. I also wish the ending would have been different, but the ending as written was unexpected and I probably would have written a more predictable ending and then criticized it for being predictable. Ha.Overall, I reallly enjoyed this book and recommend it to just about anyone."

As a type 1 diabetic, I find it super unrealistic that Roxanne’s accompanist 1) would have been able to hide his diabetes from her while they traveled on planes together, etc, 2) wouldn’t have insulin with him, 3) wouldn’t just like, you know, go get his insulin before going back in the house and especially, 4) would die so quickly. He’d fall into diabetic ketoacidosis, but first he’d be thirsty, sluggish, feeling like shit, and being all “WHY DIDN’T I JUST GRAB MY INSULIN BEFORE RETURNING? IDIOT!”I just want accurate characterizations of type 1 diabetes in fiction sometimes. Is this so much to ask? Like, does EVERY characterization have to be minimally researched and maximum offensive? Even in an otherwise terrific book? Someday I will write diabetes into a book, and make it accurate. Mark my words."

A gripping Summer Holiday™️ read with a big brained dollop of literary theory running through it. Tony Pinkney get this shit on the Utopian Fiction module asap! I'm not fucking around!!! The concept - a South American paramilitary group accidentally taking a hot opera singer and 49 hopeless simps hostage - is so completely absurd but feels like the most natural thing ever. The direction of the story is so unique. It FEELS like a thriller, but actually 90% of what's happening is incredibly heartwarming. Everyone is learning each other's languages and learning piano and falling in love and taking turns to play chess. Fate and love trickle through Patchett's beautiful writing to the extent that what starts as a terrifying situation ends as a window into a twistedly blissful, alternative way of life. But then every time you slip into that fantasy you remember that everyone has a gun on them and could get merked at any moment.So many amazing characters. So much bangin detail (you know I'll go insane for any author willing to talk extensively about decorative plates). Whenever I wasn't reading it I was yearning for it. I was loving and routing for them all, and I will miss them all now that they're gone.Stockholm Syndrome has never been so sexy."

The writing is good no doubt, the concept unique but where was the plot and execution of it.It was not even a character driven book because each character has like one characteristic , that's it.The author should have stuck to one or two pov.The only interesting character I found was the translator Gen and his unique situation in all this and then the author ruined this, by making him fall in love head over heels for the pretty terrorist. Like wtf, the girl is a terrorist holding you'll hostage and you're sleeping with her out of love,like wtf. Also conveniently she is beautiful,lolAlso everyone seem to kiss the ground that Roxanne Coss walks on yet she has no characteristic other than her voice. She is talented that's it. Mr. Hosokowa has an unhealthy obsession with this woman's voice that's his characteristic, everyone love her, that's their characteristic. Its just a mess overall.Like why where this people falling in love in such a situation and at the end that marriage is so unnecessary. A marriage based PTSD is not gonna be a happy marriage. "

Among them is a famous opera singer and a Japanese man with an extraordinary ability to speak and translate many languages. The terrorists turn out to be a fairly sorry bunch, many of them young, barely adult, uneducated and in awe of the people and surroundings in which they find themselves. As the weeks go by relationships form that benefit the individuals in different ways as we wonder how this situation will ever end without disaster and heartbreak ensuing.It was quite a beautifully told story but I found there was not enough propelling it forward for me so it didn't hold me as interested as I had hoped."
277,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/662102-libby,Rating 5 out of 5,"AFTERFinally! After some seven months I finished listening to Bel Canto, and my friends, I am prepared to eat some serious crow. My earlier reservations remain intact, but what can I say, I have seen the light.Somewhere halfway through this ambivalent little dance I'd been doing with Ms. Patchett, I started marveling at how I'd come to believe, wholeheartedly, in a world and in a set of actions, that should have been wholly unbelievable. The captives begin to fall in love with their captors, but the love does not go unrequited, indeed, the captors begin to love their captives. And this love takes many forms beyond that of romance; filial love emerges between the characters, religious love/awakening blooms, the love of one talent for another, the mentor and the mentee dynamic is delineated beautifully, the love of language, and time telling, and chess playing, and opera.AND none of the above love emerges as a form of Stockholm Syndrome. The novel is brave enough to demand that we, the readers, abandon our preconceptions ands step boldly forward into a more complex, more complicated system than the ones we may have previously elaborated for ourselves when it comes to ideas about power and authority. There are almost no ""bad guys"" in this novel or truly unredeemable people.In the end, the terror arrives in the form of the would be rescuers. The climax broke my heart. I had no idea how Patchett would see us through, the task seemed so impossible, but she deftly and piercingly nailed it.I'm really in awe of so much of what she accomplished here, from her time management to her transitions to her world building to her handling of such an unruly ensemble cast, as it were. I finished the book on the plane to Rome, and when I finally did make it to Lucca, I had to remind myself that Roxanne and Gen and Simon and Edith weren't real people, and that I didn't need to share in their sadness, the novel was that persuasive.BEFOREConfession: I am listening to this book, not reading it in the old school sense. I listened to it trekking around the Sepulveda dam/basin with the mountains of the Valley rising up all around me and the herons gliding over the rehabilitated Los Angeles river. I listened to it speeding down the 405 to Newport Beach on Christmas Eve to see a friend I hadn't seen in years. I listened to it on the plane back to this awful frozen city while I crocheted a scarf I'll never finish. And now I listen to it at night in bed in the dark when I can't sleep and don't want to bother Jason. I've listened to it in all those ways and yet my feelings about it remain constant. For no legitimate reason whatsoever I have avoided reading this book ever since it burst on the scene, sealing  Ann Patchett's stature as a leading literary light. I guess, unfairly, I thought of it as one of those literary books, like  Julia Glass's  Three Junes, which I have also never read, that readers who can't do challenging fiction love. Does that make any sense, beyond the snobbery? No!Anyhoo, a good friend of mine from the MFA program, whom I respect greatly, loves this book, so I decided it would be my next Audible download. It is a good listen, which is a whole other category in its own right (not all great reads make great listens): the narrator is skilled and the narrative is compelling, despite the fact that so far, four hours into it, it all takes place in one room (a writing feat unto itself).The premise is this: a group of international dignitaries and businessmen have gathered at the home of the vice president of an unnamed South American-ish country, to celebrate the birthday of a Sony-like Exec, whom the country is hoping to woo into opening a factory within their borders. The country has brought in the famed opera singer Roxanne Kass to sing, the exec's favorite, to seal the deal. In the middle of the party, terrorists storm the house and take everyone hostage.The novel is an object lesson in the potential and power of a third person narrative. Ann Patchett's narrator is sneaky, subtle, unparalled at shifting from character to character and scene to scene. The transitions, the seams, are invisible. It is amazing in that way. Despite the inherent claustrophobia of the setting (one house) the book feels expansive and open, because of the narrative vision and scope.However, I find the writing to be overly mannered (although I always read about Patchett's ""effortless"" and ""gorgeous"" prose). Also, the book feels flat to me, the characters who populate it feel stiff, more like beautiful paper dolls than flesh and blood individuals. Finally, every single man in the novel, from lowly terrorist to hero of capitalism, is in love with Roxanne Kass, which begins to feel a little... predictable? Boring? Patchett certainly hasn't done the work to make her believably singular, or to make us understand the power of her singing. Reading this sometimes feels too much like listening to one's male friends from high school drone on about that one pretty girl they all liked for no discernable reason beyond her great rack and hesitant smile.I'll finish it, but more to out of curiosity to see how Patchett will unfold the next five hours than out of a great love for the book."

The premise of the novel was very interesting and the characters were all so compelling. I found it fascinating how the character development allowed the reader to feel connected to both the hostages and their captors in such a powerful way. What struck me most about this novel was how the circumstances caused many of the characters to live in the moment and there was a lot of beauty in that. With their futures so uncertain, they only had ""now"" and that led to some interesting relationships & friendships. Loved this book!"

I’m so glad I kept reading because it started to pick up for me in chapter 3 or 4. I love how music brought everyone together no matter their background or the language they spoke. The characters really grow on you as you listen to their inner monologue and see camaraderie develop. The ending didn’t come soon enough but arrived too quickly at the same time. Beautifully written.Additionally, I listened to classical pieces as they come up in Bel Canto and it made the book more enjoyable for me. "

And also because the specifics of our lives matter and the trees *make* the forest. In no other book is such a notion more true: by illuminating the odd, bright specifics of each of the novel’s captors and captives we see both the depth and breadth of love (devastating joys, joyful devastations) for this is the novel’s fascination. And oh. On every page there at least three lines so spectacular and beautiful you will truly feel like you are a part of something rare—-a book that used a microscope to illuminate a universe (lol that was cheesy, but true!)

315,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45876711-jules-buono-the-literary-lifestyle,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bel Canto is an award winning Ann Patchett back list book with rave reviews that I brought to the beach with me. I thought the concept and themes were perfect: In an unnamed South American country, a world-renowned soprano sings at a birthday party in honor of a visiting Japanese industrial titan. A band of terrorists then enter the vice-presidential mansion where the party is hosted. Things go awry when the terrorists realize their target, the president, is not in attendance.They take the party guests as hostages, including Russian, Italian, and French diplomats. Over the course of months, joined by no common language except music, the hostages and their captors forge unexpected bonds. Ultimately, of course, something has to give...Themes include questions of war and peace and the commonalities in humanity. Theoretically, it doesn't get better than this. However, while I loved the beginning and the end, the middle did feel pretty slow to me, and it took me a while to get through. Overall, however, it was a very worthy read for literature lovers, one that many name as a favorite. "
316,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1859256-freesiab,Rating 5 out of 5,"This is a book for which the reviews are entirely unsatisfactory, as is the book blurb. It is unexpected and marvelous. Succinctly, it is a literary opera and like all opera it’s about love and tragedy. Perfect"
317,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1721356-ioana,Rating 2 out of 5,"What Bel Canto thinks it is: a lyrical, magically beautiful exploration of the unlikely bonds that can form between people, especially under duress-conditions (i.e. a prolonged hostage situation); a tender examination of the underlying goodness of all people (even those deemed criminals, i.e. the hostage takers); a metaphorically rich illustration of the parallels between beauty (opera in this case) and life, coupled with an interrogation of ""what really matters in the end"" when we are faced with life-death scenarios.What Bel Canto  actually is: a privileged, ahistorical, implausible, racist, sexist, meandering ode to the power of opera. (1) Privilege & History: I am highly indebted to Annalisa's review for pointing out this glaring deficiency. Bel Canto is really a book about opera/music/love of art and the power of art to sustain us through crisis. But there's a real story here, too. The story of a 1996 hostage attack on the home of the Japanese ambassador to Peru, and subsequent events (please read Annalisa's review!). And the fact that Patchett not only excludes all politics from her telling, but also does not deem it necessary to bring attention to the historical context for her work and to the plight of the real-world people she describes, even in the epilogue or in ""author notes"", is, imho, dangerous for its omissions. This is a story of terrorism as can only be told by a privileged person who has never known oppression as experienced by those who truly suffer, and in remaking their story into a ode to opera, Patchett not only silences their voices, but minimizes their plight and in effect, colonizes the collective memory of the historical event.(2) Racism & Sexism: present themselves frequently throughout the pages of Bel Canto. There is the ""unnamed country"", of course, and the ""noble-savage"" tropes used in much older literature. It's a story we've encountered too many times before: savages from the mountain, fawning over soap and linen, with powerful white men aghast at having to cook their own dinners. Then there is the constant fawning over the Opera singer, who sustains the group through her heavenly singing, and who sends everyone into paroxysms of delight. Those are but two examples, there are plenty more instances of thinly veiled racist/sexist stereotyping.(3) Meandering Ode to Opera: This was probably one of the most boring books I've ever read, and one of the few I stayed up to finish in a day or so because I just couldn't wait for it to be over, to move on to the next thing. There's no reason for us to care about any of the hostages or terrorists, because we don't know them before the story starts; and while their stories unfold with the crisis, since there is no grander arc than ""look at this person, he has a history, a brother or mother whom he loves, he is a good person"", these interludes and backgrounds provide little satisfaction or enticement to continue reading. Too many times I wanted to just stop wasting my time and shelf this as ""unfinished"", but I plodded on for one reason alone: despite how turned off I was in every respect, I will allow that Patchett is a skilled writer, so I felt I owed this book at least a skim-through to the end (this is also the reason for the additional star above 1).There's a bunch of other reasons I didn't enjoy this, but I've already wasted too much time trying to finish both reading and writing any kind of review, so I'll leave with this: (4) Implausibility: there's simply no reason to believe a true hostage scenario would unfold as Patchett describes. She certainly has no experience in the matter, and much of what occurs reads like a romanticized version of what an art/opera afficionado may dream into being - that, in the end, when faced with death, wo/mankind would choose art, and be saved by art, and realize that the only thing that matters is art and love. While I myself would love to believe this, I am not naive; if anything, this perspective only serves to underline Patchett's privilege, and the ways in which it blinds her to the realities of suffering as it actually occurs in the ""real"", historical world.

321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/440929-yosafbridg,Rating 5 out of 5,"Bel Canto gathers together a rather disparate group of people of varying nationalities and classes in an unnamed South American country to hear a world renowned American opera singer perform and to make important political and business connections. Gathered at the vice-presidential mansion for an elegant party celebrating the fifty-third birthday of Katsumi Hosokawa, the CEO of a huge Japanese electronics firm whose business the country (and everyone else is hoping to woe). Hosokawa is there because of the soprano, everyone else is there because of Hosokawa. Once the soprano finishes her last song (the one Hosokawa requested) everything goes black and eighteen terrorists storm into the room taking everyone hostage.At that moment few of the hostages feel they will escape the situation alive, and though Ann Patchett may write with a light and subtle hand, it is difficult for the reader to see this being an easy or terribly ecstatic read. However, in some ways those expectations are defied. Once i was about one hundred pages into the novel i found myself unable to stop until i reached the end (a little over two hundred pages later), i'm not even sure how long that took me. As the first day of the crisis moves into the first week, and then into further weeks, finally moving into months; both guests and guards find themselves settling into routine; into an almost uneasy Stockholm Syndrome and taking the reader along with them. Although we gain glimpses into many of the characters' lives and pasts (of necessity, mostly male) we gain very little into that of the soprano, Roxanne Cos, except what we observe of her and filtered through the eyes of her many admirers; which seemed to me to be a strength rather than a weakness of the novel. This is a world peopled with characters whose lives revolve around Roxanne, around opera, both her opera and soap opera (those they watch and those they live. This is a world that never leaves the mansion. It has transcended time and reality, in the same way the novel transcends time, reality, and difference. Both the people living in this world and those reading about it know that it will come to a crashing, inevitable end, but somehow wish to escape that inescapable eventuality.Apropos of nothing, there was also a (somewhat) hidden staircase in this mansion, something that i am completely enamoured of. I was always longing for some kind of secret passageway or stairway or secret rooms in the various houses i lived in growing up, and was always searching for them on the odd chance that i might find one (after all Trixie Belden~of the books i devoured at the time~was always finding them, not to mention the secret passage ways in Clue~although those weren't much fun just whisked you from one place to another.) Imagine my disappointment when, renovating my basement bedroom, my stepfather, shining a flashlight into a cubbyhole behind the furnace, exclaimed ""Look, a hidden staircase!"" only to illuminate the Nancy Drew book i had apparently dropped back there. I did live in a house in grad school where, we discovered a ""servant's"" staircase boarded over, right over our basement stairs, off of our kitchen bathroom leading to our second floor bathroom closet, where i kept my shoes (i once was late for one of my classes because my roommate was in there performing his ""toilette""~whole other story...) Another roommate and i plotted how we could uncover those stairs but, alas, it was never to be. Anyway, the staircase in this novel brought a tiny thrill, and all those associative memories flooding back...Both a friend and other reviewers have mentioned some dismay at the epilogue (perhaps a sense of tacking a happy ending on something that really shouldn't have one) but i saw it not so much as a happy ending as a fit conclusion for survivors of a truly tragic trauma (how's that for alliteration?) moving on in any way they can."
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6970638-sheri,Rating 4 out of 5,"I liked the premise of this even though the Stockholm syndrome (when someone falls in love with a kidnapper) is nothing new. Patchett does a great job with all the moments in the novel in which a few characters communicate deeply (sometimes even without a common language); she also manages to keep things entertaining even though the setting never changes and ultimately not much happens that is unexpected (they wait for 4+ months and then the military breaks in and shoots the ""bad guys""). It was a well developed character piece with no real change; just growth of characters and commentary on the ""greyness"" of deciding who is ultimately a ""good guy"" and who is a ""bad guy.""I thought the fact that the president was not there simply because he was at home watching a soap opera to be hysterical. I read that this is loosely based on a real-life hostage situation; I'm not sure if this detail is accurate or not, but either way it was very funny.Ultimately, the novel is about love. It starts this theme with the Thibaults renewed affection. Simon realizes once he has been exiled to this ""godforsaken"" country that he does really love his wife: ""he found her again, like something he never knew was missing, like a song he had memorized in his youth and had then forgotten. Suddenly, clearly, he could see her, the way he had been able to see her at twenty, not her physical self at twenty, because in every sense she was more beautiful to him now, but he felt that old sensation, the leaping of his heart, the reckless flush of desire."" I think there is much to be said of the difference between the first bloom of new love and the enduring love of the long married. Thibault is startled back into noticing his wife (rather than just co-existing with her) and Patchett's prose describes this well.Next, we see the love of the famous. Certainly, some of the guests are in love with the opera (something I don't share and don't quite get. I understand the beauty of song and I have seen my share of operas, but ultimately music does not reach me the way that it would some. One complaint I had about this book was that EVERYONE in it...including the most jaded of guerillas are in love with both the opera and Roxane), and see Roxane as a physical representation of the music. Others, are in love with her as a celebrity: ""(with the exception of the priest, who she could not understand) all the men in their desire to speak to her had decided to leave her alone as if it was some sort of respect, so alone she sat."" I was not convinced that everyone in the room should react in this same way. Finally, Patchett explores new romantic love between couples (Gen/Carmen and Roxane/Mr. Hosokawa). These couples are ultimately very different (especially since one of them do not share a language), but both relationships are based on mutual respect and admiration. I also thought it was fitting that Gen and Roxane are married in the end. After all, Roxane was the first woman to whom Gen said ""I love you"": ""It simply had not occurred to him to say it and now on the first day of his life when it might have been appropriate to speak of love to a woman, he would be declaring it for another man to another woman."" Unfortunately, she was not the first woman he loved; but one can understand how such a life changing experience (not just the kidnapping, but the loss of a newly found loved one) could bring the two together. No one else could quite understand their feelings for each other and for the lost ones.Overall it was entertaining and well written with some poignant moments. I wasn't completely sold on all of it, though which is why I only have it 4 (and not 5) stars."
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34951827-jessica,Rating 4 out of 5,"Heartbreaking, but not necessarily in a depressing way. I like how there were little glimpses of what was going to happen and that coloured the way you saw certain events."
324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2439952-charlie-ravioli,Rating 5 out of 5,"The story of a private birthday party for a Japanese executive somewhere in South American in which a world-renowned opera singer performs to a crowd of unrelated, influential, international guests that goes awry when local terrorists take everyone hostage and the interconnected relationships that emanate over the protected period of captivity.Interestingly, the publication date of the book was May 22, 2001 which was soon after the dotcom bubble bursts but less than 120 days before the world truly changed as a result of actual terrorist attacks on 9/11.Central to the book is the before and after effect of how everyone’s lives come into sharper focus and clearer depth once they are forced to slow down while trapped in captivity, almost like an extended form of meditation. Paradoxically, once taken hostage by the terrorists, each character is unfettered from the confines of their chaotic, self-interested daily concerns and once freed (from their personal subconscious prison) experiences a deeper, more connected mental state.Wikipedia states that Bel Canto denotes ""the Italian vocal technique of the 18th century, with its emphasis on beauty of sound” and references Sara Rodgers in her book The Philosophy of Singing who states “the true purpose of singing is to give utterance to certain hidden depths in our nature which can be adequately expressed in no other way given the voice is the only vehicle perfectly adapted to this purpose; it alone can reveal to us our inmost feelings, because it is our only direct means of expression. If the voice, more than any language, more than any other instrument of expression, can reveal to us our own hidden depths, and convey those depths to other souls of men, it is because voice vibrates directly to the feeling itself, when it fulfils its 'natural' mission. By fulfilling its natural mission, I mean, when voice is not hindered from vibrating to the feeling by artificial methods of tone production, which methods include certain mental processes which are fatal to spontaneity. To sing should always mean to have some definite feeling to express.”This book made me think whether I have experienced a similar life event. Something where my normal existence was terrorized by some outside agent for a prolonged period that unlocked my mental state into a deeper understanding, a time when Life got in the way of my life and I discovered the beauty of Life. The answer is yes, when my wife had cancer almost 25 years ago and the 1-year period that became her survivor story. Similar to the character Messner (the Red Cross worker/negotiator that shuttles to and from and keeps both the terrorists and the prisoners tethered to the outside world), I was my wife’s caretaker. These were long days and strewn with “hidden depths in our nature”. And as odd (or wrong) as it may sound but identical to the prisoners in the book, I hated but also cherished and sometimes even miss those days given the singleness of my purpose and the clarity of my mind and existence. And although the cancer is gone (thank God), the memory of it all (like Carmen) have survived and emerge every so often but especially when I experience something as pure and beautiful and thought-provoking as Bel Canto."
325,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6991670-bob,Rating 4 out of 5,"Summary: An international group gathered in a South American country for a dinner party to celebrate a Japanese industrialist's birthday are taken hostage in a failed attempt by a revolutionary group to seize the country's president. When months pass without a resolution a strange, an oddly wonderful community develops among hostages, and captors, one strangely forgetful of the inevitabilities of a hostage situation.Roxane Coss is a world-renowned opera soprano from America who agrees to fly into a South American country to sing at the birthday of Japanese industrialist Mr. Hosokawa, who has loved her voice from the moment he first heard it. He is joined by his ever-diligent translator Gen Watanabe and celebrated by an illustrious cast of dignitaries at the home of the country's Vice-President. President Masuda is also expected to be present in this ill-disguised attempt to persuade Hosokawa to locate a factory in the country. But President Masuda, stays home at the last minute to watch his favorite soap opera.On that last minute petty decision turns the whole plot. What was meant to be a kidnapping of a president by a revolutionary militia becomes a protracted hostage siege. Joachim Messner, a Red Cross negotiator visiting the country steps in, with the help of Gen the translator. Ultimately 19 revolutionaries hold 39 men and one woman, Roxane Cass.At first the threat of death hangs over the hostages, who saw the Vice President brutally pistol whipped and Roxane's accompanist die in what they too late learned was a diabetic coma. As time drags on and only demands for food and necessities are met, the phenomenon know as the ""Stockholm syndrome"" develops as bonds form between hostages and captors, even various kinds of love between Roxane Coss and Hosokawa, between the efficient and retiring Gen, and the girl soldier Carmen, between boy soldier Ishmael and the Vice President, and Cesar, another boy, with a tremendous voice who Roxane dreams of turning into a great singer.All of this is narrated by Patchett in her voice of measured wonder. She describes the unfolding of a world where captives and captors nearly and sometimes do forget the reality of a hostage siege which must end in surrender or bloodshed. It is a world that at least some do not want to end. Perhaps only the negotiator and Father Arguedas, the poor parish priest who volunteered to stay, knowing a priest would be needed, see clearly the alternatives.Even here, she finds a way to end a book in a surprising implausibility that one didn't see coming, and to this reader just didn't seem quite right. It is true that she is not predictable, but the very best do unpredictable in a way that is satisfying, where one might say, ""I didn't see that coming, but it fits, it works.""Of all of Patchett's novels, I think this the best. The characters she draws, the measured progress of the plot, moving at the speed of developing relationships and situations, and the strange wonder of the world she creates all draw one in and forward. I will likely read another Patchett book because of the quality of the writing and the stories she develops, and I'll keep hoping for that fitting ending."

327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74932-sydney,Rating 4 out of 5,"Here's the setup: a bunch of richies and dignitaries and businesspeople converge in the mansion of the Vice President of a poor, unnamed South American country. The guest of honor, a Japanese businessman, Mr. Hosukawa, thinks he's there for his birthday party, but really, the South Americans brought him in so he'd decide to invest in their country. But the only way they could get him to come was by paying loads of money to bring his favorite opera singer, Roxane Coss, to perform at the party. Roxane is singing her last song when all of the lights go out, and the party is cut short by a band of gun-wielding terrorists looking for the South American president. He's not at the party (having stayed home for a potentially embarrassing reason I won't disclose). So they decide to just take everyone at the party hostage until their demands are met. What follows is a several-months-long standoff between the terrorists inside the mansion and the police and Red Cross outside. Neither side will budge. And inside the house, boundaries between terrorists and hostages, South Americans and Russians, men and women, become blurred. Over time, complex relationships form among the people inside the house, and these relationships are at the center of this novel. Patchett's characters make this book. They are sympathetic and multidimensional. That's one of the best parts; the characters, like real people, constantly evolve. They cannot be pinned down as ""bad"" or ""good,"" heroes or villains. Their actions are impossible to predict, and this makes them fascinating. And Patchett juggles them easily. She shifts from one perspective to the next several times within chapters and describes the same events through multiple pairs of eyes to flesh them out. She's also really good at getting inside people's heads. The way she describes emotions is dead-on, and this also makes it easy to empathize with all of the characters. As for opera, let's be real: I've never listened to it, nor have I been interested in doing so. But the way Patchett describes opera makes me want to go out and get some. The music becomes another of her characters. It lives inside the house, and it changes what happens inside. Patchett's characters mark time by music (waiting for the music, listening to the music, and reflecting on the music), and the story can be broken into similar chunks based on what's happening with the music at any given time. Highly recommended. Let's talk about this book while we stand barefoot in unmowed grass because reading this makes that sensation sound so incredible. Right? "
328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6130276-alondra-miller,Rating 4 out of 5,"4.5 StarsI must admit it. I absolutely loved this book. I have read some reviews after reading, and there are quite a few that are quite harsh. I expected as much, given that there is a background to this story based in truth. There was an actual kidnapping in Peru of the Japanese ambassador. Many reviewers felt Ms Patchett did a disservice to the Peruvian people/country by not telling the true story. I thought this was a work of fiction based on a truth? I thought this was the author creating a ""story"" of what could possibly have gone on in that house for the 126 days that the hostages were in there? It is called imagination, fantasy or just plain fiction. We know through the history and news reports, everything that happened. This is just her fictional version.... and I liked it.Anyway.... This story has been calling to me for months and I could not wait to read it. I am not sure why, but I could feel how beautiful it would be. It was. Beautiful. I don't particularly like opera, but I love music in general and classical 'moves' me. To base so much emotion upon this piece of art, and infuse it into the characters, was an interesting move by the author. To link everyone's humanity to a soprano voice, and creating a bond that followed in life and death for these characters, was just amazing to read. I am not sure if Stockholm Syndrome had anything to do with what happened between the hostages and terrorists/kidnappers; or if it was just time and circumstance. I only know that I loved the characters, their story, and the mood of the book. I don't think this book changed my life, but it did touch me. It was romantic (i hate romance books), thought-provoking, tender, lovely and disappointing. The ending made no sense, but made all the sense in the world. We, as the readers, knew it was coming and we were not prepared. We were not prepared to have the hostages hearts broken, and love lost. It was unfair to the characters, and unfair to the reader. How two pages can turn the tide just gets me upset. That is why this book did not get 5 stars from me. The ending reminded me of Mockingjay in the Hunger Games trilogy. That ending made no sense either... I mean marriage and babies; Suzy-happy-homemaker?? give me a damn break!! . I miss these characters already and hope that if you decide to read this book, that you do so with an open mind. This is a work of fiction with only a hint to its truth. Many books are created this way, so grab your favorite blankie, a cup of tea and enjoy."

As the hostages adapted to their capture, they learned about their captors and understood themselves and the mistakes they were making in their everyday life and they resolved to make changes if they were freed. Terrorists realized that there was another way of life and discovered opportunities that they had never considered.This is a great book and would be fantastic for a book club discussion. As I was reading, I had a strong feeling how the book would end (sorry, not spoilers here) but found myself hoping that I was wrong. I loved learning more about the characters, understanding how a few key terrorists were recruited and thinking about how things could be different.I am thankful that it was gifted to me by Alan, a member of the CanadianContent Goodreads group. It was a great book and one that I will recommend. I had previously enjoyed State of Wonder, Commonwealth and was in the midst of listening to This is the non-fiction book, This is the Story of a Happy Marriage (which so far was a collection of essays about her experience writing) when my time ran out… I am waiting to finish it as I was disappointed to find out that there were 5 people ahead of me waiting to check it out.Ann Patchett is not only the author of 7 novels and 3 works of non-fiction but also runs a bookstore in Nashville, Tennessee. Her website states that she is known as a “spokesperson for independent booksellers, championing books” and I am looking forward to reading more of her work."
