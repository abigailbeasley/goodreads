In this case, you unpack a sucker punch of feelings straight to the heart and we are all better for it. Claire Keegan’s Foster is such a book, being taut and economical in Keegan’s pitch perfect prose but delivering an emotional resonance far surpassing its brief 80pgs. Originally published in 2010 in Ireland where it garnered awards and school curriculum reading, Foster has finally arrived on US shelves, no doubt aided by the success of her recent novella, 
Small Things Like These
, which was nominated for the Booker Prize this year, and the film adaptation of this book. I found Foster to be even tighter and more succinct, which was to its benefit though Small Things was fantastic itself, and this novella manages to say so much in all the unsaid moments. Thriving through a story taking place beyond the grasp of the pre-teen girl who narrates the story, Foster is a tiny, bittersweet masterpiece that captures the aches and living and comforts of love all set against a lush Irish landscape.‘“I try to remember another time when I felt like this and am sad because I can’t remember a time, and happy, too, because I cannot.’Foster is a simple enough story, a young girl is sent to live with distant relatives for a summer while her mother is pregnant with yet another child and the short time together builds a deep emotional resonance in the lives of the girl and the Kinsellas who take her in. While it is a tight and succinct novel, Keegan depicts gorgeous landscapes and has an ear for dialogue that brings this story to life and makes you feel like you are with them as they run to the Irish sea or play cards amidst the laughter of the night. While there are only a few passing scenes of domestic life—a shopping trip, life around the house doing chores together, walks through nature and a wake—a whole world of emotions explodes from every sentence, even if the narrator can’t quite corral them into words. ‘I have learned enough, grown enough, to know that what happened is not something I need ever mention.’There is a beauty in the way Foster exists most in awkward spaces, in the silences between words, the space between dark and light, or between understanding. ‘Everything changes into something else,’ the narrator observes, ‘turns into some version of what it was before,’ and we are met with frequent references to the world around her in moments of flux. This is a very loving household, though one that values both openness and knowing when words are not necessary. Mrs. Kinsella is upfront about this from the start: ‘‘Where there’s a secret,’ she says, ‘there’s shame – and shame is something we can do without.’’This seems to contrast with the narrator’s home life, one we are lead to assume has landed her here because the father drinks and gambles too much and they have too many mouths to feed than they can afford with another on the way. We also have Mr. Kinsella’s thoughts on not always needing to speak:’‘You don’t ever have to say anything,’ he says. ‘Always remember that as a thing you need never do. Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.’’Better to be quiet than be a fool. Though this is also reflective of the novella itself and how so much understanding is in the unsaid. Much of this is built through the perspective of the narrative that is attempting to recount ‘things I don’t fully understand, things which may not even be intended for me,’ and written only through how she is able to comprehend the world around her. There are cute flourishes such as the narrator mentioning Mrs. Kinsella asking for ‘Aunt Acid’ at the pharmacist (presumably antacid) and other misreadings that no attention is called to and brings the narrative voice alive. It is a massive success and sticks the emotional landing through the dramatic irony that we are watching the narrator just on the cusp of understanding while ourselves knowing how her heart will inevitably crack open when it sinks in deeper in the time after the novel has concluded.The idea of silence, however, also plays into the political backdrop of the novel and the culture of silence that permeated Ireland during The Troubles. The wrong words, or any words at all, could land you on the wrong side of the violence. Midway through the book there is a brief conversation about a hunger striker who has died, reminding us of the violence lurking within the idyllic landscapes of Ireland and Kinsella questions if he has earned being well fed while people are starving for freedom. 'A man starved himself to death but here I am on a fine day with two women feeding me.' Of course this also juxtaposes the girl's family and her starving sisters and asks us if they deserve to go without due to the sins of their father. Perhaps some of the darkest aspects of the book go in silence as well, only hinted at—Kinsella teaching the girl to run the very specific distance from a house to a road, her bed wetting and avoidance of her own father seem to possibly imply an abuse that is never vocalized.‘He looks happy but some part of me feels sorry for every version of him.’There is a tender, sore spot at the center of the novella that is only addressed briefly and directly once, but the bruise is felt throughout. The Kinsellas are a loving family now without a child, trying to do best by the girl now in their care while also trying to not resent her family who have many children growing up without care. This novel drifts dreamily through the summer towards an inevitable end and a final paragraph that is certain to tug your heartstrings into tears. We see the girl being as much a gift for growth to the Kinsellas as they are for her, with the girl observing ‘I feel I have her balanced,’ about Mrs. Kinsella. In a scene ripe with symbolism, the man is only able to find her footprints to retrace home and jokes ‘You must have carried me there,’ though this is the sort of joke that reveals a deeper emotional truth about their attachment. My heart skipped a beat when, looking out over the sea, he points to the three lights in the sky and says that earlier there had only been two. 'There, the two lights are blinking as before, but with another, steady light, shining in between.' The imagery is beautiful.'My heart does not so much feel that it is in my chest as in my hands, and that I am carrying it along swiftly, as though I have become the messenger for what is going on inside of me'I can’t stress enough how beautiful and emotionally charged Foster was for me. David Mitchell has compared it to Anton Chekhov which isn’t wrong, as each sentence feels carefully crafted and chosen in construction of this sturdy and succinct little story that has a power as deep as books thrice it’s size. Keegan has an ear for dialogue and a gift for perfect sentences that feel like squeezing an ocean from a stone and Foster is a miraculous novella of the ways love can creep in and fill our hearts.5/5‘As soon as he takes it, I realise my father has never once held my hand, and some part of me wants Kinsella to let me go so I won’t have to feel this. It’s a hard feeling but as we walk along I begin to settle and let the difference between my life at home and the one I have here be.’**Update: Finally watched the film adaptation— An Cailín Ciúin (The Quiet Girl)—and it was absolutely wonderful. I cried again. Shoutout to my partner finding it online as it’s not in the US yet. Great performances, they change Mr Kinsella at the start a bit but it builds nicely due to that, and I loved that it’s mostly in Gaeilge. The interpretation of the final scene is great and I like how it shows the duality of the final line. Watch the trailer here.**"

2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7234171-jaline,Rating 5 out of 5,"A poor Irish family, large with children, is going through a rough patch. They live near Clonegal so it is a fair long trip for her father to drive the little girl to spend some time with her relatives on the coast in Wexford. She allows her imagination to form pictures in her mind of who the Kinsellas might be: what they look like, how they are, what their home (and hers for the next while) is like.While she lives with the couple, the little girl experiences many things she had never encountered before, and her mind is busy absorbing and sorting and placing these thoughts and feelings where she feels comfortable with them. Her relatives spend time talking with her, teaching her, and validating her. Even when she makes mistakes, it is given to her to figure out how to do better next time.She also goes with them to a funeral and through people she meets there, she sees reflections of her old life at home – attitudes, compulsions - the stirring of pots that don’t need stirring, the small unkindnesses that may not be meant but are uncomfortable all the same.And then, after time has passed, the letter comes asking the relatives to bring her back home.This short story is a treasure. There are lessons on nearly every page that we can all learn from. I know that I did. The writing is beautiful, the cadence of melodious speech pitch-perfect. I highlighted so many fresh and inspiring passages that I have had to refrain from including any of them in this review: I simply can’t choose only a few.When I love a book or a story, I talk about how I feel about it and what I think about it, but in my reviews I rarely ever encourage my friends and anyone else who is reading random reviews to go out and find the title and read it. Immediately, if not sooner. I am saying it now, because I believe this story has something of value for each of us. Maybe not the same “something’s”, but that isn’t the point. It is all about the adventure, the seeking, the finding, and the joy of experiencing a wonderful story well told.Thank you to our esteemed author and revered book friend, Kevin Ansbro, for bringing this story to my attention. You were right – it probably did take less time to read this than the time it takes to make a casserole!"

""If I hadn't seen such richesI could live with being poor.""
—From the song Sit Down, by James.Set in rural Ireland, this very short story is spoken in the first-person narrative by a dirt-poor tinker’s daughter whose anonymity throughout serves to emphasise her incidental existence.The girl's struggling mother, who gives birth as frequently as a hen lays eggs, has another on the way, so leaves the child in the care of the Kinsellas - farming relatives whom the kid has never met. It swiftly becomes clear that our young narrator is unused to home comforts; even a hot bath is alien to her. The Kinsellas (themselves bereft of a child) are only too happy to lavish their unsentimental brand of love upon their menial charge.Much is intimated but left unsaid by the author. Keegan expects her readers to fill in the gaps and draw their own conclusions. The girl is damaged but her wretched life has at least taught her to observe and adapt. Cautiously, she begins to blossom in her bright new world of hot baths and unbidden kindness. Slowly but surely our child-in-limbo dares to become the flower that grows through a crack in a pavement.The prose is deliberately sparse, which I didn't mind as it perfectly suited the gritty subject matter. In an almost surreal fashion, the characters ghost around each other, amping up the overall sense of detachment and fear of commitment (put me in mind of Bruce Willis's solitary interaction with humans in The Sixth Sense).Although I'm not usually a fan of a bare-bones narrative, there is clear evidence here of the author's confident penmanship. It's an intelligent piece, mostly because of the details that are kept from us, and which loom large in our imagination.I won't be giving anything away by saying that the girl's conflicting loyalties are vividly captured in a poignant, almost cinematic, final scene.Not the best book I'll read this year, but an achingly sad and evocative capturing of a moment in time that requires the reader to work in tandem with the author."

I was looking forward to reading/listening to more of her work and decided on only other novella. She mainly wrote short stories, will get to them soon enough.Foster was really good, powerful and tender but it somehow did not touch me as much. Maybe because I already knew what to expect from the author. A small girl is sent to live with foster parents on a farm in rural Ireland for an unknown time. There, she discover warmth and affection but also a secret. It is written in first person and, if I remember well, there was more in what was not on the page than what was written. "

Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.”When a young girl from Clonegal, Ireland, in 1981, goes with her father to a farm in Wexford she has no idea what to expect. Told only that she will be staying with a man and his wife, the Kinsellas, she doesn’t know if she will ever be going back home. Her mother, Mary, is with child and near her time.

Unforgettable are her final pages which break your heart.My dear friend Jaline from Canada, and friends to many on Goodreads, wrote a plea to read this novella of 88 pages “immediately, if not sooner.” I decided to take her up on it, and did so.

6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8148922-gaurav,Rating 4 out of 5,"Everything changes into something else, turns into some version of what it was before.It is the second book by the author I read in last fortnight, normally I don’t read more than one book by an author in such a short span of time, but the author here delightfully forced me to do so. The world of Claire Keegan is the familiar one with tight prose, beautifully honed out of the various probable mix of words to produce shimmering text of miraculous potency. The book may be slim in the size but the impact it has on its reader is equivalent to that of a few hundred pages long book. Claire Keegan is an author of sparse, and thin but assertive sentences which beam with inexpressible joy of lively prose. While the big books have their importance as they draw out the characters’ life from various aspects, these pristine gems with formational brilliance stand apart as if the venerated space, they live in, is too sacred for anyone or anything to touch. The artistic skills required to condense the words to produce such a taut prose is not ubiquitous and in fact, quite rare, for it may require the precision of a surgeon to craft sentences which may convey your views in a few words. We have on one hand literary geniuses like László Krasznahorkai who produce pages long paragraphs without having sentence breaks to portray the reverberating melancholy of life through the ripples of monstrous sentences, so as to be called as master of apocalypse. While on the other hand there are authors such as Claire Keegan who craft their sentences with minimal words however the undulating sensation waves the prose of minimalism may send across the reader are second to none. link: sourceWhat does it take to write with such a lively succinct prose as if it’s beaming with pure existential bliss, perhaps the aptitude of a patient observer and precision of a woman of exclusive and eclectic tastes. The story starts in the silent rural background of Ireland wherein you may feel the sense of tragic air blowing through the landscape of Keegan; however, it reveals itself in a restrained manner as if precisely controlled by the author as to when to release out or pull back. The author’s world is a provincial one wherein the discussions of her characters, mostly farmers, often hover around the price of cattle, the E.E.C., butter mountains, the cost of lime and sheep-dip.The reader would appreciate the extraordinary ability of the author to make some of the very old stories to be alive and specific as if they are too unique to be emulated. I guess what differentiate Keegan from others is that though you may guess the story right from the onset but it would surprise you with its stunning liveliness, it takes time to sink in since you keep thinking and imaging it, eventually to be etched in our your consciousness and thereby becoming a part of your memory; it is like swimming through a fresh stream of water which affects you deep in our soul through its melancholic beauty. We have the narrator as a young girl in the rural Ireland who is sent by her parents to live with the Kinsella family, someone she has not seen before and not familiar with, during the process of her mother, Mary prepares to deliver another child in a household fluttering with children. The house of Kinsella’s echoes the tunes of mystery often associated with human abodes having shadows of bygone existences, as if these apparitions of extended human existence try to convey their miseries and plights.  Neither one of us talks, the way people sometimes don’t when they’re happy — but as soon as I have this thought, I realize its opposite is also true. link: sourceThe narrator experiences the life in a way which is altogether unknown to her, in the foster care, she is cared for, bathed, taken out to buy new clothing. She gets a new leash on life wherein she is being catered and heard in a way she never has been, as if her being springs out of the sea of nothingness to life and for the first time she feels what it is meant to be truly alive. The man of the house, John teaches her some truths of life to metamorphosize her- “By the time this summer ends,” he promises, “you’ll be like a reindeer.” Gradually her mind shifts to the newly found understanding of life and sense of primal fear creeps in her consciousness while realizing the possibility of shattering of this dreamlike existence on going back to her home. The author manages to weave in the entire world in just a few thousand odd words as if the entire universe is contained in the foster home. There are some scenes in the book which makes one to feel the magnanimous soup of life, one of them is when the narrator hold Kinsella’s hand, the emotions of the narrator seems to be pouring out with eyes so full of happiness so as to not to say anything as if the sheer joy fills one’s soul to the brim. As soon as he takes it, I realise my father has never once held my hand, and some part of me wants Kinsella to let me go so I won’t have to feel this. It’s a hard feeling but as we walk along I begin to settle and let the difference between my life at home and the one I have here be.link: sourceThe prose of Keegan is so engrossing that we seem to be in the tight grip of concise but beautiful sentences of the author to see, feel, hear and observe the world of the narrator as if we are having the privilege of first-hand experience. Foster is not a typical minimalist novel like that of Ernst Hemingway or Samuel Beckett but it is somewhat in an enigmatic way having a self-sufficient prose which has all the necessary details intricately infused in it with the precision of an artist of highest grade. The prose of the author may look to be minimal in appearance to the casual reader, but its scope is certainly so full, rich and luxuriant, which may reveal itself more with every reading. Claire Keegan uses first-person, present tense narrative to intertwine the world of the narrator child as if the things are occurring in the immediacy or perhaps to underline the sanctity of the narrator’s universe as a timeless truth. Though our narrator is a young child here, but the author has masterful in her portrayal to make the story an believable account of innocent but careful and insightful observations of the narrator’s tender age. The requisite balance between the innocence and intelligence quintessential to the age of the narrator is perfectly poised by the author, so as to pull the readers into narrative to feel the emotions of the narrator. This lovely account of saddening beauty of human relationship, its grace, yearnings, pain and emotions will be etched in the memory of the readers for a longtime.’Nothing happened.’ This is my mother I am speaking to but I have learned enough, grown enough, to know that what happened is not something I need ever mention. It is my perfect opportunity to say nothing."

She trusts her readers and allows them to read between the lines to find the deeper meaning. This is the type of writing that makes me glad to be a reader.This is a novella, but one that needs to read slowly in order to read between the lines, and absorb what is being left unsaid. It’s a heartbreaking and poignant look at the power of kindness in the life of a young girl who has known only deprivation, and her rebirth after being shown love and kindness. In one home she is living in abject poverty and seen as a burden, where even the most basics of needs are not met, especially love. In the other home, she is loved and cherished and seen as deserving of good things. I love an author who trusts her readers. It’s not the things that are spoken that will break your heart, it’s the things that are unspoken. Her sparse prose belies the deep meaning within. The author is able to say so much and leaves you with a story that begs to be pondered.And, oh that ending….*I received a digital copy of the e-book for review via NetGalley. All opinions are my own"

""It's too good, she is. She wants to find the good in others, and sometimes her way of finding that is to trust them, hoping she'll not be disappointed but she sometimes is.""
 ― Claire KeeganJudging by the title and the cover, Foster was not what I expected, yet was everything I could have wanted it to be. The writing is so pure that there is no effort in the reading. I absorbed every word and was transported to a farm in Ireland where I met a girl with long legs, taken by her impoverished father to spend the summer with relatives. It sounds like a straightforward tale, but I promise you it is anything but simple.The youngster, one of many siblings, found herself an only child in this new home environment. It was uncomfortable in a comforting way. Mrs. Kinsella, the substitute mother, scrubbed away the child's dirt and replaced her worn dress with sturdy work clothes. The story is filled with relatable exchanges that might have appeared humdrum if written by a lesser author, but in the hands of Claire Keegan became a cleansing of the soul – mine included.I don’t want to give away the soulful beauty that lies between the covers of this incredible book. Suffice to say, Foster is eighty-eight pages of brilliance. Keegan wrote the book that my heart already knew about, and by the time I turned the last page, I felt I was that girl in Ireland. Bravo, Ms. Keegan!If you haven’t read this, I urge you to run - don’t walk - to your nearest bookstore and pick up a copy. It would be a terrible shame to miss this glorious short story!I’ve already pre-ordered her next book, and I can hardly wait!"

I am in a spot where I can neither be what I always am nor turn into what I could be.”At the onset of the novel, we meet our young narrator as she is being driven by her father to a relative’s home in Wexford County in the Irish countryside. She is to remain in John and Edna Kinsella’s care for an undecided interval of time. She has never met the Kinsellas before and is uncertain of how she will fare with her foster family.” But this is a different type of house. Here there is room, and time to think. There may even be money to spare.”Edna and John are a kind and compassionate couple. They take care of her and involve her in their daily routine. From what we understand, when compared to her home with her parents, her experience with her foster family is markedly different. Unlike her own family where she is one of many children (her mother, Mary, was heavily pregnant at the time of our young narrator being sent to the Kinsella’s home) and there are more mouths to feed, here she wants for nothing- food, clothing, kindness and a deep emotional connection- a family among whom she feels loved and wanted. She observes that there is a lot of work that is done throughout the day on the farm, but Edna and John proceed at an easy and unhurried pace. Edna and John have secrets and have experienced loss in the past but they embrace this young girl as a part of their family. She reciprocates their feelings and in their care, she thrives. However, this arrangement is temporary and as her time with Edna and John nears its end and she is taken back to her biological family, we share in her realization of how the definition of home and family can change over time. As her heart breaks, our hearts ache for her. Much is left unsaid and left for the reader to understand and interpret. Claire Keegan’s prose is simple yet elegant. Seen from the eyes of a child, the story revolves around themes of family and belongingness and how even the smallest gestures of kindness can profoundly impact the innocent heart of a child. With its vivid imagery and emotional depth, Claire Keegan’s Foster is a short but impactful story that will stay with you long after you have finished reading. Last year I was first introduced to Clare Keegan’s work with her beautiful novella, Small Things Like These. With Foster, Claire Keegan does not disappoint and proves without a doubt that she is a masterful storyteller.Many thanks to NetGalley and Grove Atlantic for the digital review copy of this poignant novella.

Her mother is pregnant again and there are many mouths to feed at home. At John and Edna Kinsella's house, she is the only child at the table. She is shown kindness, given new clothes, and made to feel welcome in her new surroundings. She has chores to do, lessons to learn, and rules to abide by. Yet with daily displays of affection from her foster parents, her feelings of uncertainty remain. She wonders if she'll ever be going home and then begins to wonder if she really wants to...What a beautifully written story and I continue to be amazed by Claire Keegan's ability to confine so much emotion and life into short reads time and time again. I love how she leaves an 'unspoken' ending to this story allowing the reader's imagination to take hold and create their own. For me, this writing style encourages a deeper dive into the hidden depth of a story and its characters.The audiobook narrator Aoife McMahon breathes life into all the characters with her range of voicing. This is the third listen I've had the pleasure to experience Aoife's beautiful Irish accented narration and it's one that shouldn't be missed. In addition, since this is such a short read, I listened to it twice, back-to-back, and happy to report I discovered more details to the story the second time around! I believe everyone should read or listen to a Claire Keegan book. She is a remarkable storyteller and I have plans to read everything she has written and continues to write. I highly recommend this audiobook. All five stars!Thank you to NetGalley, HighBridge Audio, and Claire Keegan for an ALC of this book. It has been an honor to give my honest and voluntary review. "
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily,Rating 4 out of 5,"Secrets and shameAdult emotions can be hard to fathom when you’re a young child, especially if the reasons are hidden from you. Some families explicitly have secrets, others claim to have none.“There are no secrets in this house… Where there’s a secret… there’s shame.”When adults keep secrets from their children, they usually say, even to themselves, that it’s to protect the children. Often, it’s to hide the parents’ shame. Sometimes secrets are by omission:“You don't ever have to say anything… Many's the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.”We’re told it’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. I’m not sure that’s true of romantic love, let alone any other sort of love. What about mild poverty and neglect: is it better for a child to stay in the familiar family home, with parents and siblings, or to have a taste of something better? When the story stops, everyone has had glimpses of ease and happiness, but I think they are all sadder as a result. Was it worth it? Image: Illustration of the girl running, by Simon Pemberton, for the original short story in The New Yorker (Source)Ireland now, back thenThis novella is told with the breezy immediacy of the first-person present tense. It’s about a little girl being sent to spend the summer with relatives she’s never met. It’s set in a small town in SE Ireland, probably around the 1980s. The town is real and named; the child is nameless and seems to be about seven or eight. Her mother is pregnant with yet another child they can’t afford, but this girl is the only one sent away. She doesn’t know how long for, or why, though her father jokes about the expense of her appetite. Back-to-front Irish syntax in the dialogue roots it in the Emerald Isle.“It’s only missing her I’ll be when she is gone.”Time to care“This is a different type of house. Here there is room, and time to think. There may even be money to spare.”The Kinsellas are not wealthy, but they have wondrous things like a washing machine, freezer, vacuum cleaner, and a deep bath filled with hot water. There are chores, but fewer and less pressured than back home; there is time and space to teach her to do things properly. They are kind, gentle, and generous, and there are tender and understated scenes with the Kinsellas separately and together. Such kindness exposes her divided loyalties: when Kinsella holds her hand, she realises her own father has never done so.“My father has never once held my hand, and some part of me wants Kinsella to let me go so I won't have to feel this.”The girl realises money doesn’t buy happiness, despite the joyful extravagance of being given a pound to spend in a seaside town. She sees the shadow of sadness in the Kinsellas long before she has any understanding of its cause. Image: Silhouette of the girl and Mrs Kinsella in a field, from the film. (Source)Who’s talking?“I feel at such a loss for words, but this is a new place, and new words are needed.”The bewilderment, gratitude, and blossoming of the girl is delightfully, plausibly portrayed. But there is an inherent problem: how much is the narrator’s adult hindsight skewing her analysis? For example, when she thinks of her sisters throwing clay against the gable wall, which will turn to mud in the rain, she muses:“Everything changes into something else, turns into some version of what it was before.”Her parents are not given to that sort of abstract talk.Quotes•	“This way men have of not talking: they like to kick a divot out of the grass with a boot heel, to slap the roof of a car before it takes off, to spit, to sit with their legs wide apart, as though they do not care.”•	“In a spot where I can neither be what I always am nor turn into what I could be.”•	“He is given to lying about things that would be nice, if true.”•	“God help you child.

You can read that version HERE.•	After reading, I watched the film. Inevitably, there are a few things you won't know or might not notice if you haven't read the book, but I thought it really good in its own right, and as an adaptation. It’s mostly in Irish, is called An Cailín Ciúin or The Quiet Girl, and has been nominated for Best International Feature Film at next week’s Oscars. It is explicitly set in 1981 with a 10-year old girl and filmed in the sort of muted tones Wes Anderson uses. There are lingering shots of dimly-lit interiors, the landscape, and the farm, with little need for words. Dialogue is sparse, and mostly taken directly from the book. See imdb.By chance, this was my third consecutive book about children being sent away. It made for interesting comparisons, as the three are very different:•	Being sent to single-sex boarding school aged 11. I wrote about my experience, in lieu of a review of Ysenda Maxtone Graham’s Terms & Conditions, HERE.•	A 16-year old is sent to a mental institution for more than 60 years, for trivial and wrong reasons. It’s fiction that is close to many real cases, and, remarkably, it’s not a depressing book. Maggie O’Farrell’s The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox, which I reviewed HERE."

But this is a different type of house. Here there is room, and time to think. There may even be money to spare. ABOUT 'FOSTER': A small girl is sent to live with foster parents on a farm in rural Ireland, without knowing when she will return home. In the strangers’ house, she finds a warmth and affection she has not known before and slowly begins to blossom in their care. And then a secret is revealed and suddenly, she realizes how fragile her idyll is.MY THOUGHTS: Claire Keegan writes with a poetic beauty that reminds me of calm waves lapping at the shore. Although the reality of where this young girl has come from, and will be returned to, is harsh and stark, Keegan's writing is anything but. There is a stunning emotional depth in this novella. Keegan conveys much in very few pages. There are a lot of lessons to be learned here on how to treat a child, and the blossoming of this girl away from a life of overcrowded poverty, just one of many children, in a place where she is recognised and cherished as a person in her own right, is a wonderous experience. I have been awed by everything I have so far read by this author. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐#Foster #NetGalley I: #clairekeeganfiction @groveatlanticT: @CKeeganFiction @GroveAtlantic#fivestarread #historicalfiction #irishfiction #novella #sliceoflife THE AUTHOR: Claire Keegan was born in County Wicklow, the youngest of a large family.

16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91622714-rosh,Rating 4 out of 5,"In a Nutshell: Touching and subtle. Beautiful writing, heartfelt emotions, realistic characters. You’ll want more at the end. But you’ll also realize that you have acquired far more than the 90-odd pages contain.Story Synopsis:The unnamed first-person protagonist, a child of unspecified age, has been sent by her parents to live with a foster family on a rural Irish farm while her mother readies herself to give birth to yet another child. She doesn’t know the people she is to stay with, and she doesn’t know when she is to return home. What she doesn’t know is that life is going to bloom for her in this foster home. But all good things come to an end, right? Or don’t they?I loved the three main characters: the child and the two foster parents. Keegan sketches their personalities in a striking way without going into details. It is only with every subsequent scene that you begin to put a picture of what might be the backstory of the characters.I’ve read three Claire Keegan works so far, and each time, I’ve read the respective story twice. The first time the regular way, and the second time to see what more clues I might have missed. Her writing is very intelligent, and she also respects her readers’ intelligence by not spoon-feeding them every single detail. Nor does she shove the emotions into your face but causes you to feel them through simple scenes and hidden cues. I do appreciate this trait of hers, though it makes me work that much harder to glean the best of her writing as she leaves a lot unsaid. In this story though, I wish she had revealed at least a few more details. The age of the protagonist, for one. While we can gauge that the child could be anywhere between 6-10 years old, but I like knowing the age of child characters so that I can picture them and their behaviour better. Names in all their forms have a significant role in the delivery of this novella, which is quite ironic as our narrator remains anonymous throughout the story. She is referred to variously as ‘girl’ or ‘petal’ or any other term, which reveals how the speaker views her. What is also interesting is her own approach to names. Her temporary foster mom, for instance, is always “the woman” in her thoughts while the foster dad is mostly “Kinsella”. There is also a significant moment connected to names at the very end, which is the most poignant moment of the story.The writing is, as always, poetic without being over the top. Keegan maintains in her scenes the perfect balance between description and conversation, never allowing one to overpower the other. She is also true to the national identity of the characters, and retains the Irish lilt in their lines. The child’s emotions of awe and worry and fear and comfort come out well through the first person rendition. The story is medium-paced, and it would be better if you read it slower to get the exact sense of what’s happening. Keegan’s books are never to be skip-read. The bittersweet ending left my heart longing for more. Though I know it was the only possible ending for this story, one can still wish that fiction worked better than reality and gave the girl an ending she deserved instead of an ending she was destined to have. All in all, this isn’t a story that will leave you easily. It isn’t perfect, but it is striking in its writing and memorable in its characters. Definitely worth a read. 4.25 stars.My thanks to Grove Atlantic and NetGalley for the DRC of “Foster”. This review is voluntary and contains my honest opinion about the book.‘Foster’ was an international bestseller on its release in 2010, and one of The Times’ “Top 50 Novels Published in the 21st Century.” A variant of this story was published on the New Yorker site.

17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/98741439-michael-burke,Rating 5 out of 5,"Claire Keegan once again delivers magic. “Foster” presents an unnamed young girl who finds herself shuffled off to an aunt’s house while her mother is in the final stages of a pregnancy. This girl has been neglected, both by an overworked mother and an insensitive father who– even when he is dropping off the girl– fails to say goodbye or even let her know if she will be coming back. ‘Good luck to ye,’ he says, ‘I hope this girl will give no trouble.’ He turns to me then. ‘Try not to fall into the fire, you.’Every child craves and deserves attention. The aunt and uncle immediately take to her and she is bewildered by the comfort of a nurturing she has never known. We feel a confidence blooming as the girl comes to understand she fills a need in this house, a need springing from an intimate secret. “Foster” is an updated version of a short story Claire Keegan published years ago. Like last year’s powerful “Small Things Like These,” we become emotionally attached to characters living in a believable world. She has the remarkable gift of drawing you into her stories and I find myself rereading each a number of times to savor her magic. I strongly recommend sharing this young girl’s life changing journey. “Kinsella takes my hand in his. As soon as he takes it, I realise my father has never once held my hand, and some part of me wants Kinsella to let me go so I won’t have to feel this.”Thank you Grove Atlantic and NetGalley and Edelweiss for providing the advance reader copy in exchange for an honest review. #Foster #NetGalley***Nominated for an Academy Award, ""The Quiet Girl"" is based on this story.

She’s not an orphan as you might suspect when thinking of a foster child. She’s one of number of children in a family struggling to feed and care for their children where love and warmth is as devoid as the food on the table. She’s sent away to stay with relatives for a summer. She makes a journey that is not just to another house to live, but a journey of the heart to a place she never knew. She finds not just the comfort of the food she’s missed, what a hot bath felt like, but the comfort to her young heart and soul by a simple touch, a kiss on the cheek. An awakening that there was a different life from what she knew. I many times enjoy stories from the perspective of young children, whose innocence and perceptions never fail to touch my heart. This was no exception. I don’t usually like it when I don’t know the main character’s name because sometimes I feel separated from them. However, that was not the case here. I can’t quite give it five stars because I wanted more in the end . It’s a short novella, but it’s a profound and beautifully sad story. Another by Claire Keegan that made me want to read the rest . I hope to see the movie The Quiet Girl which is based on this story."

20,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles,Rating 5 out of 5,"At the end of last year, I was telling everyone I met about a novella called “Small Things Like These,” by the Irish writer Claire Keegan. It’s about a coal seller who discovers a troubling secret in his village just before Christmas. I don’t have much faith in predictions — the future’s tastes are impossible to fathom — but “Small Things Like These” seems destined to be a classic (rave). Now comes another little book by Keegan — a short story, really — called “Foster.” The New Yorker published an abridged version in 2010, but this lovely hard-bound edition, with the original text, is a keepsake. Keegan’s work takes me back to when I first experienced the palpable thrill of entering an author’s world. Her sentences are so artfully honed but so free of artifice they feel as rough and verdant as sprigs of fresh heather. “Foster” is about a little girl from a poor Irish family. With her mother pregnant, again, and her ne’er-do-well father unable to provide for so many mouths, the girl is handed over to the Kinsellas, a childless couple in another village. The transition is abrupt; her father drops her off without a hug or kiss, or any indication of when he might be back — just a quip: “Try not to fall into the fire, you.”Although the girl is nervous, her new guardians are tender and kind. She’s awed by the unfamiliar atmosphere of their home. “Here there is room, and time to think,” she says. “There may even be money to spare.” After she wets the bed on her first night, Mrs. Kinsella brushes her shame aside, cleans up the mess and insists it’s only the mattress weeping. When Mr. Kinsella takes her for a walk, “he takes shorter steps so we can walk in time.” She suddenly realizes: “My father has never once held my hand.” With the simple incidents of village life, Keegan captures the spirit of a girl being loved and appreciated in a way she’s entirely unaccustomed to. “I feel at such a loss for words,” she says, “but this is a new place, and new words are needed.” Our perspective is limited to the girl’s impressions, but we can tell that the Kinsellas’ affection is tinged with grief and with the knowledge that this child is theirs only for a short time. I don’t want to say anything more about “Foster,” except “Read it.”This review is drawn from The Washington Post's free weekly Book Club newsletter.

Che talvolta è prodromo dell’adozione, o, comunque, di un affido permanente. In questo caso, invece, l’affido è a termine, il tempo di un’estate, il tempo che la mamma porti a termine la gravidanza e partorisca.Ma è e sarà un’estate indimenticabile per la Quiet Girl, come la definisce il bel film che è stato tratto da questa novella dell’irlandese Claire Keegan.A rendere l’estate indimenticabile c’è la calda accoglienza degli zii, la sorella della madre e suo marito, che vivono in campagna a nord del paese. Non hanno figli e per la quiet girl che invece sulle pagine del romanzo è più loquace, meno silenziosa, e viene da una famiglia dove c’è poco tempo per cure e attenzione, magari perché la prole è numerosa (Certo, con tutti quei bambini), magari perché c’è sempre tanto da fare tra casa campi e bestiame, e l’economia domestica è più faticosa e stentata – un esempio illuminante: quando il papà che ha accompagnato in auto la figliola a casa degli zii decide di ripartire – il più presto possibile, come se si annoiasse, o avesse davvero tanto da fare – se ne va senza salutarla, senza dirle che tornerà a prenderla, e si riporta via la piccola valigia della bambina. In fondo, mamma e papà si sono detti che gli zii se la possono tenere finché vogliono, nessuna fretta di riaverla.Quando la zia le fa il bagno, la quiet girl pensa che:Le sue mani sono come quelle di mia mamma ma hanno anche qualcos’altro che non ho mai sentito prima e a cui non so dare un nome.Gli episodi che avvicinano la bambina ai due adulti si ripetono e susseguono: la quiet girl sembra trovare una nuova famiglia, e quest’ultima perfino più accogliente.La novella della Keegan non indugia, è rapida e veloce, procede con quel suo tono sommesso e preciso, diretto e semplice."
22,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem,Rating 4 out of 5,"  So delighted to see this book made into a movie “ An Cailin Ciuin” (The Quiet Girl) and has now being nominated for an Oscar. Beautiful Book and Movie   What a terrific find this little book was and I have no idea how I missed out on this one for so long. Foster by Claire Keegan is skilfully crafterd and thought a provoking Novella which really brought me back to my childhood with its wonderful sense of Irishness and it's rich prose and unsettling storyline. This for me is the Ireland of the 1980s and Claire Keegan has truly got inside the mind of a child and crafted a story where what is unsaid is more important than what is actually said.""image: This Novella (under 100 pages) tell the story of a a young girl from a struggling farming family in rural Ireland who spends a summer with better off childless relatives on another farm. She's been sent away during the summer to lessen the burden on her strained mother who is pregnant yet again. The girl doesn't know when she will be going home. Her father who drives her there doesn't say when he her will return for her, or even say goodbye properly. The couple, each in their own way show her a love and affection she is unfamiliar with, as she settles in she comes to learn that the couple have their own sorrows. This is one of those remarkable short books where not a wold is wasted and every sentence is skilfully crafted. On finishing this book I went straight back to page one and read the book all over again as I wanted to read it with a different view this time. I absolutely loved the sense of time and place as you see and smell the Irish countryside, experience the quiet pace of life and the rural communities where your business is everyone's business. This would make a fantastic bookclub read and I can understand why this is has won so many awards and why it is on the reading list for Leaving Certificate English in Secondary School as so much to discuss in this one."

26,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76203549-nika,Rating 5 out of 5,"4.5 starsI have been meaning to read Claire Keegan for a while. Foster turned out to be an excellent starting point. It was evocative, concise, and touching. I loved the complex simplicity of her writing. In just under 100 pages, Keegan crafts fleshed-out characters and makes the reader empathize with them.The story takes place in rural Ireland during one hot summer. It is told from the perspective of a child. A young girl has been sent to spend summer vacation with some distant relatives, a childless couple. The girl proves herself a sensitive narrator and keen observer. Her views of the events and people that surround her are authentic and honest. Although the narration does not provide many details, we can assume that the girl has received little love and attention at home. Her parents seem to be constantly preoccupied with financial troubles. They are now expecting a new addition to their already big family. This causes them to send one of their children to stay with people she has never met. However, our narrator quickly warms up to her hosts, and the feeling is mutual.Lovely friendship is born out of kindness and care. The couple not only temporarily looks after the girl, but they demonstrate genuine kindness towards her not by their words but by their actions. The best way of dealing with difficulties is not reprimanding a kid but being amiable, patient, and tactful. With such an approach, the fear of wetting the bed and breaking things evanesces.I could feel a growing sense of attachment between the couple and the girl. Does it matter that she is not their biological child? I do not think so.The summer cannot last forever. The girl knows that she will have to return to her parent's house one day. To sum up, this is a story about parents and children, about upbringing and the encouragement of development and growth (see one of the meanings of the word ""foster""). The final scene was strong and moving."

The child will be staying with a childless foster family while her mother gets ready to deliver yet another baby. The child came from a large family and through her narration, we learn what she thought is expected of her at the farm, but instead she received all the love and attention that seems foreign to her.Foster is a tender and poignant story about family and kindness. I also love the vivid description of rural Ireland during summertime. Although this is a short listen, it was beautiful.Aoife McMahon's narration is wonderful and her beautiful accent is not difficult to understand. There are words that I'm not familiar with and without a print copy, I can't really look them up. Nevertheless, that didn't ruin the story for me but made it more genuine.I may have to listen to this story again. Claire Keegan's Foster bittersweet ending left me wondering.🤔Thank you RB Media, HighBridge Audio, and Netgalley for my ALC."

The incident late in the story at the well? The foster family's recently deceased son is a kind of ever-present ""ghost"" in this story, or ghost, depending on your point-of-view. I LOVE this book, and showed excerpts from the beautiful and moving 2023 Academy-Award-nominated film based on the story, The Quiet Girl (available now on Hulu), as well.One of the things I am paying attention to in this second read is the mention of ""secrets,"" which I had not paid much attention to in my first reading, but other reviews I read later speculate on what is going on with that. In short, I think there are secrets throughout this story, though some are worth speculating about.Foster (2010, but republished in 2022, as a wider group of people across the planet, including me, were introduced to her work through the Man Booker Shortlisted Small Things Like These [2021]) is a book about an economically disadvantaged girl from a growing Irish family who is fostered for a summer by a middle-class couple--her mother is a cousin to the host woman--we come to learn later in the story had recently lost their son, to drowning.A personal reflection: When I was 9 and my sister N was 7 my father drove us to the farm of his childhood friend an hour or so from our house. At the time no one knew when or even if we were going back home. We knew very little about it, but we knew our mother was very sick; I think my parents thought she would die. We were in the same sense as this quiet girl being “fostered” on a farm. A trip to a research hospital was lucky, the cause of my mother's pain was identified and corrected and in the early fall we returned home. So this is a weird way to talk about this book, maybe, but I’ll admit I was influenced in the reading of this book by my son’s photography project (I know!) about Liminal Spaces, and we have been taking lots of photographs together, talking about what is in the lines between light and darkness, as in noir art--possibility, sure, but also fear of the unknown, mystery, magic. So since I was in that mindset I thought the whole book was about liminal spaces, in various ways, for this girl who is, after all, growing up, in the liminal space between childhood and adolescence, comparing the state of her family to a family less precarious than her own.Here’s some examples of what I mean:“It is a hot day, bright, with patches of shade and greenish, sudden light on the road.”“In places there is bare, blue sky. In places the blue is chalked over with clouds. . .”“I picture myself lying in a dark bedroom with other girls, saying things we won’t repeat when the morning comes.” (whispering in the shadows)“It’s something I am used to, this way men have of not talking. . .”“There’s a moment when neither one of us knows what to say. . .”“There’s a moment of dark, in the hallway; when I hesitate, she hesitates with me.”“I am in a spot where I can neither be what I always am nor turn into what I could be.”“The presence of a black and white cat. . .”“. . . the woman’s shadow stretches, almost reaching my chair.”“. . . everything changes into something else, turns into some version of what it was before.”“He looks happy but some part of me feels sorry for him.”“. . . we can see everything and yet we can’t see.”“. . . the wind blows hard and soft and hard again. . ““. . . things I don’t fully understand. . .”In-between-ness!There’s ominous signs of things to come, fear, worries. There are times in which the story is eerie. We learn over time that the foster parents lost their child to an accidental drowning, so the spectre of this tragic event hovers over the girl's time at the farm, climaxing at one key turning point in the story that calls forth Irish myth, in some ways. There’s a black dog, the black sea. . . she's early on wearing the boy’s clothes. . . is something beckoning in the well where the boy had drowned?“I keep waiting for something to happen.”This is a marvelous short book y’all should read right now!  “My heart does not so much feel that it is in my chest as in my hands, and that I am carrying it along swiftly, as though I have become the messenger for what is going on inside of me.”"

Keegan takes us to Clonegal, Ireland where we stand with a young girl who struggles with the parting of an emotional sea. Her father coaxes her into the back seat of the car as she nervously unties the braids that her mother tied so tightly just moments ago. Undoing the past....uncertain of the future.Keegan keeps the girl's name tightly in her closed palm. We never know if it. But what we do know is the rush to take this girl to her mother's people, the Kinsellas who live in Wexford on the coast. Mary, her mother, is about to give birth to the next one in line and Dan, her father, wishes to be done with the task of dropping her off. Edna and John Kinsella welcome the child with open arms. This ""girleen"" will be a great help to Edna. And the days go by with chores checked off on this farm. The girl warms to the touch of them both and begins to feel valued for the first time. But she knows not when her father will return for her. ""I am in a spot where I can neither be what I always am nor turn into what I could be.""And then the curtain is lifted and the young girl will come upon a secret that Edna and John have kept in the warming place in their hearts. The child is so limited in her ability to express an emotion so tender and so volatile. And Claire Keegan will find a voice for her characters like no other. Raw, heartfelt, sorrowful, and bitter sweet. Keegan knows the soft nudge of compassion and the deep knowing of the heavy footprints left behind in one's journey in life. Secrets in the dark recesses brought into the light.I received a copy of this book through NetGalley for an honest review.

And I liked her 2021 novel too — Small Things Like These.This book reminded me of ‘Ellen Foster’ (1987), written by Kaye Gibbons.

A nameless girl, referred to only by pet names by the foster family whom she finds herself living with, surrounded by love and a sense of the expectation of change.  Highly recommended"
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11889829-suz,Rating 5 out of 5,"Being new to this author and having introduced to her work via So Late in the Day, I have such respect for the writing style of somehow saying so much, by using so little. A very small book lacking flamboyance, but in no way a small story. Big hearted and emotional, this is the story of a young girl given away to a childless couple while her own parents deal with another birth to a growing family, which they can certainly not afford. This couple have their own past, they work hard, grappling with their own trauma and learning about their own strengths and weaknesses as well. A beautiful couple, making up for as much as they can for this girl, in an unpretentious and loving way, a respite for the girl providing love, the comforts of home and a lovely environment with good food and a peaceful abode. The girl does not know how long this sojourn will be, and I, the emotional wreck I am when I listen to these stories, wanted it to be forever. A warm bath, clean clothes and toenails, freshly shampooed hair. She deserves this and so much more. Life lessons both incidental and more impactful, are shown to her with care and grace, while never being sappy or overly sentimental. Again, as in the book mentioned earlier, the ending is impactful and provoking, leaving me to ponder the story in its gentleness and brutality. I felt enveloped into their love, as much as I saw theirs for the girl, and the emotional impact on their lives not to be taken lightly, either.I listened to this via BorrowBox and my public library - I always feel drawn in by the lovely Irish lilt."

Foster has been adapted to film in a movie called The Quiet Girl which was nominated this year in the Oscars.I was not as immediately enamoured by the book as many of the other reviewers were. The author writes beautifully but I can never feel really enthralled by a story which is not clear to me. I know I can make up my own ideas but I do not want to. In my mind the author is writing the book and I am merely reading it, not making my own conclusions as to what may have occurred.In this instance I finished the story and had no idea what had happened. I searched around online and read other people's ideas and thought yes - that may be it - or perhaps it was something else. And I just feel dissatisfied. It was definitely an unhappy ending with no real hope for the future - I managed to infer that much!I guess I just have to accept it was not my kind of book. Three stars for the beautiful writing and the wonderful feeling of being in Ireland and amongst its people. Weirdly I have to say this was a beautiful book to read despite the fact that I did not understand it. "

""If you were mine, I'd never leave you in a house with strangers."" pg. 18Foster by Claire Keegan is a beautiful short story that evokes big emotions in such little pages. It takes place in rural Ireland, following a young child who is taken to live with distant relatives, not knowing if or when she will return home. She soon learns that there is a huge juxtaposition between her original home, where she and her many siblings starve due to an alcoholic father who leaves barely enough money to feed the family, and her new home, which is full of warmth and love. ""Ah, the women are nearly always rightm all the same,"" he says. ""Do you know what the women have a gift for?""""What?""""Eventualies. A good woman can look far down the line and smell what is coming before a man even gets a sniff of it."" pg. 38The writing and prose in this story is stunning. I was raw and emotional, without being aggressive and overbearing. The Irish countryside setting, with a hint of The Troubles, really served well to mirror the contrasting worlds the young girl was experiencing, one of conflict and one of closeness Foster really reminded me why literary fiction is my favorite genre, I really have not read enough of it this year!"

I loved this author’s style of writing. The language is spare and much is implied as details are slowly unfolding. It’s a great example of showing instead of just telling a story and made all the more powerful and vital for it. I’m the ninth of ten children raised in an Irish American family. Most of my siblings are gone now and some were raised during the Great Depression.

She doesn’t know for how long, but her mother is having another baby, and she would just be in the way at home. Her father says almost nothing.“He turns to me then. ‘Try not to fall into the fire, you.’ I watch him reverse, turn into the lane, and drive away. “There are no children in the house, and she is almost overwhelmed when the woman later gives her a big, long luxurious bath, something she has never had all to herself!“The bath fills and the white room changes so that a type of blindness comes over us; we can see everything and yet we can’t see.”When they look for the girl’s clean clothes, they both realise her father has left her in such a rush that he forgot to leave her belongings. Some small pants and shirts are found, and the girl begins to settle in. She’s very unsure of herself, but she enjoys helping on the farm, and unlike stories of mean-spirited foster parents who take kids in just for free labour, these people seem to care about her. At one point she hesitates to reply to the man.“He laughs then, a queer, sad laugh. I don’t know what to say. ‘You don’t ever have to say anything,’ he says. ‘Always remember that as a thing you need never do. Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.’”What good advice. Both the husband and wife pay attention to her and offer suggestions and build her confidence. When she learns something of their history, she begins to understand them. Her behaviour reminds me of a rescue pet that is unsure what to expect – punishment or kindness. We are all animals, conditioned by our circumstances, after all.The word foster can mean to take care of a child, usually temporarily. It can also mean to encourage an interest or talent, or growth. I think Keegan uses it in both senses of the word. I’m partial to her stories and her people, so of course I thoroughly enjoyed this novella. Thanks to NetGalley and Grove Atlantic for the copy for review.It was a lovely read to end my reading year. Happy New Year!"
39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors,Rating 5 out of 5,"That such a short story could provoke such a deep impact is nothing short of astonishing. From the opening lines of this deceptively simple narrative I felt my gut clench tightly, anticipating an emotional blow that didn’t fail to arrive in the form of a single word put in the precise context. “Daddy”.Kindness when not expected can be a miraculous gift but when taken away it can turn into cruelty. The little girl who thrives in the care of her distant relatives knows she will have to go back to her family where love is scarce and kindness a luxury when too many mouths have to be fed as her mother needs to make ends meet with a gambling and absent father.As in her other stories, Keegan’s artistry relays in the small details, in the things left unsaid, in the charged glances between the little girl and the poor couple who embrace her as their own. The imagery is rich, the swift descriptions of the Irish summer are vibrant with color and expectation, and a small walk along the riverside with a man who smiles, who holds the smaller hand of a girl craving love, guiding her footsteps, becomes an opening of the heart, a source of healing and restoration. Where there were only two half-extinguished lights in the shore, there are now three, shinning in spite of the darkness looming above; three hearts beating at the rhythm of a new found family, as fragile as that new-found balance might be."

41,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39272121-marilyn-trying-to-catch-up,Rating 5 out of 5,"Foster by Claire Keegan was such a moving and touching story. This was the first book that I had the pleasure of reading by Claire Keegan. Her writing was so exquisite and her descriptions of the Irish countryside were so authentic. They made me feel like I had been transported back to that impressionable summer of 1981 and saw the Kinsella farm through the eyes of young Leanbh. Foster was a very short story or novella. Although it was stingy when it came to the number of pages the book was comprised of, its deep and meaningful message was heard loud and clear. Leanbh was a young girl who lived on a poor Irish farm with her mother, father and many siblings. The family was quite poor. Affection was not something that any of the children of Dan and Mary expected or experienced. It was just the way things were. At the beginning of the summer of 1981, Leanbh’s mother was near the end of another pregnancy, with yet another child. Without any explanation or discussion, Leanbh’s father drove her to a farm that belonged to a distant relative. Leanbh had no recollection of ever meeting these strangers. Her father left her with these strangers without any explanation of why she was spending the summer with them or when she would return home. There were no hugs, no promises of seeing each other soon. After delivering Leanbh to the farm that belonged to John and Edna Kinsella, her father just got in his car and left. Leanbh was all of six or seven years old. What kind of parent does that?Leanbh took some time but eventually settled in and realized for the first time in her young life that there are all kinds of families. She looked forward to spending time with both Edna and John. John and Edna Kinsella showed Leanbh kindness, cared for her, taught her things, displayed patience, honesty and compassion and had no inhibitions of displaying their feelings toward her. The time Leanbh spent with John and Edna Kinsella was magical for her. It was in such sharp contrast to her life with her own mother, father and siblings. Would Leanbh have to return to the home she grew up in? Edna and John were also harboring a secret. Would that secret surface? How would it affect them if it did? What would Leanbh’s fate be?I really enjoyed reading Foster by Claire Keegan. It was beautifully written and triggered all my emotions. I look forward to reading more books by Claire Keegan. If you have not read this heart wrenching book I highly recommend it. Publication is set for November 1, 2022.Thank you to Grove Press for allowing me to read Foster by Claire Keegan through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."

It seems as if Claire Keegan enchanted the whole world and I keep falling for good reviews and try her again and again. Admittedly it's easy to do since she wrote so little and everything is so short. And I got Small things like these all over again: manipulative, unsubtle tearjerker. I was so surprised hitting the last page that I went on the google and apparently this short story is studied in schools somewhere. So there are study guides. And I read one and it gave me nothing. I guess this might work for tiny kids. Is she a young children's author? Don't worry, you'll never have to read my reviews of Claire Keegan's work ever again!"
43,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/730754-ken,No Rating,"On the cover of Foster is a pithy David Mitchell blurb: ""As good as Chekhov.""Wow. Go there, Mitch. Where angels fear to tread.Really, if I were author of this book, I might be flattered as hell with those words, but it would seem bad ju-ju to plaster them all over the cover, so either Claire Keegan is one confident scribe or the marketing team at Grove Press is one to be reckoned with (incoming Russian missile -- Chekhov, no less!).Speaking of marketing, much like the other Keegan I read and enjoyed in October, Small Things Like These, this isn't really a novel. Novella, maybe? I suppose, at 92 pp., but when you consider the huge font, perhaps even a long short story is more honest.Wasn't it Poe comma Edgar ""Spell-My-Middle-Name-Right"" Allan the one who defined a short story as a piece of literature one read in a single sitting, one that had a single powerful effect? Check (but not -hov) and check (but not Chekhov)!Whatever. Call it a hedgehog, if you wish. It's a curious little period piece that reminds me of America's pastoral past. You know, a place where schools are actually off summers so children can help with the harvest. No, wait. This is Ireland, not Indiana. One's a red state, the other a green state -- or in Keegan's adept hands, a ""read"" state.Dunno. It just feels like comfort food reading tiny little books about family, everyday household and farm tasks, cows, milk, water in dippers, neighbors who drink, neighbors who want to know your business, families with secrets, families who claim to have NO secrets (when, like mammals with hair, shedding all secrets is a familial impossibility), so on, so forth.And the plot. Simply the oldest in the book. Little girl goes to spend time with relatives on farm and finds in them a distant mirror, one that reflects parts of herself she never knew. That's all, folks. A challenge to pull off, but Keegan does it with aplomb, with grace, with a minimalist style that hits the right spot as if in answer to a dare.So, yeah. One sitting. Singular effect. Liked the book, even though not much happens. Makes you wonder if we're ALL novellas or long short stories because nothing much happens. In our lives, I mean (and I'm discounting those who put their every thought and move and dinner and day trip on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok, to which I can only say #whocares). In this little protagonist's case, I did care. And if it's as much about subtext as text, so much the better. Unsaid sometimes fills a room more than said.Or so I've heard said.Bottom line: Recommended, if low expectations ride shotgun."

And...This short novella packs an emotional punch in its telling of a young girl in 1980’s Ireland sent from her home to live with an older couple for an undetermined amount of time. The story is narrated by the girl, whose observations are keen, naïve and perceptive at the same time. When…Entering the home unbathed in ill-fitting clothes, we become aware of the poverty that existed for this girl. We learn she is coming from a household with several sisters and a pregnant Mom, along with a Dad who gambles away important assets. And…When her new caregivers provide her with a bath, and clothes and respect, we sense a feeling of need in them that carries over to the girl. “The sun, at a slant now, throws a rippled version of how we look back at us. For a moment, I am afraid. I wait until I see myself not as I was when I arrived, looking like a gypsy child, but as I am now, clean, in different clothes, with the woman behind me. I dip the ladle and bring it to my lips. This water is cool and clean as anything I have ever tasted: it tastes of my father leaving, of him never having been there, of having nothing after he was gone.”Is it possible that maybe her parents won’t come after her and she can stay with this loving couple? Or…Will we experience utter heartbreak if she is expected to return home?“Kinsella takes my hand in his. As soon as he takes it, I realize my father has never once held my hand, and some part of me wants Kinsella to let me go so I won’t have to feel this.”And then…How are we to feel when the woman who cared and gave so much to this girl says to her…“If you were mine, I would never leave you in a house with strangers.” Kleenex please."

What intrigues me about Keegan is that her stories appear so deceptively simple and are composed in such clear, sparse prose (just look at Small Things Like These), but they develop depth through the quiet empathy that fuels the narration.""Foster"" is written through the eyes of a young girl (in the movie, she is nine years old - seems about right) who is sent to temporarily live with foster parents parents until her mother has given birth to yet another sibling - the family is poor, the father drinks and gambles, both birth parents seem emotionally neglectful. Thus, the girl spends the summer on the farm of a married couple, the Kinsellas, who pay close attention to her needs and treat her with kindness and respect - and the girl experiences a whole new mode of life. Slowly, it is revealed that the Kinsellas suffer from their own trauma, as they have lost their young son.The story is full of precise observations, written through the eyes of a kid that comes from an emotionally stifled environment, learns to open up and constantly ponders the world of the grown ups around her. Sure, the text is loaded with intense metaphorical imagery that could easily veer into kitsch territory when employed by a lesser writer, but when Keegan tackles it, it works. It's a tearjerker, but masterfully done, because it beholds emotional truths that are easily relatable. This author is starting to win me over, and I guess I have to read more Keegan."

I especially could not find this book, Foster, which is enjoying a new publication, so of course I became obsessed looking for it. And then, what do you know? The book showed up on NetGalley. No sooner had I requested it when I received an email from Grove Press offering me a copy for my honest review (talk about timing). So, first of all, my honest review. I loved the book and I love this author (one might have guessed since this was the THIRD book I read by her in as many weeks).A young girl’s father drives her to the Kinsella farm in another town, where Mr. and Mrs. Kinsella have agreed to look after her for the summer until her pregnant mother gives birth to sibling #? (everyone has lost count). The young girl leaves the reader to believe that her mother would be happy for her to stay indefinitely, and she is clearly troubled by this. Her fear that she is unloved is validated by the fact that her mother is not affectionate by nature and rarely hugs or nurtures her other than the odd query whether she would like another pancake on a morning.Mr. and Mrs. Kinsella take the time to parent her, include her almost completely in the family circle of friends, teaching and nurturing her in family chores, personal hygiene, values, and instructing her in the proper way to respond and converse, plying her with treats and affection that she has never experienced. The Young Girl clearly loved the routine, order and stability, and threw herself into the role with enthusiasm.Watching the child’s emotional growth and development in just those few months where the Kinsella’s were devoted solely to her was captivating. She was so warmly treated that she dared to indulge herself in the fantasy of staying on and continuing in the role of “only” child in the Kinsella household. We were offered a glimpse of the close-knit farming community where neighbors. including the Kinsella’s, reached out to help one-another….and also to gossip about one another.It was interesting to watch how the child’s loyalties are naturally bestowed, on her family and how those loyalties manifested also in defense of the Kinsellas, who she came to love and view as surrogate parents.So, How do I Love Thee Claire Keegan?I love thee because your prose is beautifulI love thee because the reactions of your characters are pitch perfectI love thee because your stories are original, unsettling, and unexpectedI love thee because you are not sappy and make me cry, although your characters or the circumstances they find themselves in are often tragicI love thee because you take me to places and times I have never visited (including emotionally and intellectually)I love thee because you say what you have to say in 200+ pages or less (God Bless You.

But summer never lasts… It’s rare that I agree with any of the cover blurbs - “a real jewel”, “a thing of finely honed beauty”, “a small miracle” - but this time I completely do: Claire Keegan’s Foster is a masterpiece. The way Keegan tells her story is about as perfect an example of the writing adage “show don’t tell” as she shows us what her narrator’s home life was like with her biological parents in how her aunt and uncle address her various problems when she arrives at their farm. Similarly, there’s the unspoken question of why the girl is there in the first place, and why a childless couple could be such excellent parents. As scant a story as there is - it’s mostly the girl doing chores with her aunt and uncle around the farm and house, and venturing out into the nearby village - it’s never boring. I think it was Stephen King who pointed out in “On Writing” that readers simply enjoy reading characters doing things, no matter how banal, and that’s probably one reason why. Another reason might be how warm and kind John and Edna Kinsella are - they are the ideal parents that you rarely see in fiction, in the same way that Atticus Finch was an ideal father in To Kill a Mockingbird - and it’s an irresistible quality that many readers will respond to. If the story had simply been just that - an idyllic summer where a neglected child experiences a wonderful home life, however briefly - this would still be an undeniably charming book. But Keegan adds another layer to the story of the Kinsellas by explaining why a couple so clearly perfect for parenting could somehow manage to be childless and, like so much about what makes this such a remarkable book, it’s a quietly devastating reveal that really puts it into the top tier of fiction. It’s amazing that the narrative builds to such an emotional climax in such a short amount of time but it manages to do it, and, still more impressively, it’s earned. I don’t expect many will fail to be moved by that ending - I know I was in tears, in the best possible way. The ending - do you know how difficult it is to write a good ending? And Keegan does it beautifully. What a writer. I don’t have a lot of good things to say about art awards but this year’s Booker did one positive thing which was introduce a lot of new readers, including me, to Claire Keegan via Small Things Like These and, like a domino effect, hopefully onto her other books, like Foster. Both novels are fantastic but Foster is really special. A small novel full of heart, impeccably written, with a wonderful cast of characters and a compelling narrative - Foster is the best book I’ve read all year and I couldn’t recommend it more. "

Or, ""That dog is the spitting image of its human,"" (which I think is true at least 90% of the time).Now, come to find out from this novella, I know it is spit and image, which doesn't make any more sense than ""spitting image"" if you ask me. That's what stands out for me most with this book. So many people love it and get the feels from it. Me? I'm just amazed to learn I've had a phrase wrong my entire life. It's a sweet story I guess, about a little girl who goes to stay with another family for a while. It's kinda sad, but I found it pointless. Perhaps that's all the point is, to get the reader to feel for the little girl? I don't know, but these kinds of stories make me feel like I'm a robot compared to most people. Yeh, it's sad, but I still don't see the point, the reason the author had in writing it, the reason normal people love it. (Image: GIF of humanoid)~The spit and image of me and my cold, cold heart.~It's written well, and unlike this author's Small Things Like These, not full of unnecessary and distracting commas. I enjoyed reading the dialect and ""hearing"" the Irish accent of the characters in my head.

Here she finds a stark contrast to her own family and home, not just economically but also in attention and behaviors.the heart of the story…We never learn the real name of the child but she comes to be called Petal by John Kinsella who slowly develops an endearing relationship with her. She’s aptly nicknamed as she “blossoms” from a quiet, almost invisible little person to one who begins to thrive and engage. Edna Kinsella shows her kindness and care but it’s John who becomes her teacher. Petal isn’t the only one who’s thriving as the Kinsellas have a heartache of their own to heal.the narration…It was helpful to have an Irish narrator, one who seemed to perfectly capture the spirit and nature of the child who has the sole point of view. I could “hear” her changing. the bottom line…The simplicity of the story is its strength as we experience the child’s reaction to warmth, affection and attention. Sustenance is a factor but it’s her burgeoning relationship with John that has a lasting impact, a man far different from her own slacker father. The ending still haunts me, one I had to rewind and listen to several times. It’s a beautiful, poignant story that will inspire and sadden you at the same time as her return home is destined. 4.5 starsPosted on Blue Mood Café"

Many's the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing."" (p.64)It was put to me while I was reading this, that I was laughing a lot. Yes, it's quite sad I explained. Given the above quote, which I note is popular among reviews of this book - you see you'll not find originality here in this review, the best thing might be to look at the Swiss Cheese and concentrate on it's holes. The less said about this booklet, the more eloquently and comprehensively it is reviewed. A young girl from a growing and squalling family is taken by her father to stay with relatives - I took them to be her uncle and aunt, but that's not explicitly said. The girl is very observant, but maybe not the best at drawing conclusions from the adult world around her. She might stay with these relatives for much of a Summer, or maybe a bit less. Anyway, the story really focuses on the first couple of weeks and the last couple of days of her stay.During this time we see, or perhaps feel, the holes in the cheese, and those revelations make the story. However before I give you the impression that this is all about the negative space, the moments of dialogue and character interactions are a joy too.The story reminded me of one of the tales in Edna O'Brien's collection saints and sinners, but I don't remember which one, so maybe I'm just fooling myself anyhow. A quote on the back cover evoked Chekhov, which is generally a safe reference for any short story because he wrote so many varied tales, but Foster reminded me of reading The Steppe many decades ago, just because of the atmosphere of a child brought into a different environment and their response to it."

A young girl pluked out of poverty and neglect and placed in prosperity and love only to be pluked from prosperity and love and placed back in poverty and neglect.

71,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie,Rating 5 out of 5,"Simply perfect. Hardly long enough to even be considered a novella — more of a long short story — Foster is packed full of narrative power, atmosphere and depth of character. A poor County Wexford farming family about to welcome yet another child in an already teeming brood sends a young daughter to summer with an older, childless farmer couple. They welcome her with matter-of-fact kindness, integrating her seamlessly into their quiet lives. The child marvels at the order of their homestead, the calm bounty of their kitchen and of their hearts. Despite their grace and their obvious contentedness as partners, there is a sadness to these dignified country folks. When the child finally discovers the source of their sadness, she is drawn to it while the reader watches helpless and keening.Claire Keegan writes with a spareness that belies the profundity of her story, the massive arc of emotion that we swing through when a child races to the bottom of a lane to fetch the day's mail, her heart full of an old man's soft praise as he waits for her to arrive home again. Much of the story's power lies in the white space, in the unsaid, which is really the room that Keegan has left for the reader's heart. If your soul isn't flayed open by this tender, lovely, achingly sad story, you might check for a pulse. "

73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55478778-laura,Rating 5 out of 5,"I liked this - a lot, I'm surprised to hear myself confess. Surprised because I started on her popular short story collection 'Antarctica', published 1999, and hated the first one - of the title - 'Antarctica'. See my review for a full appreciation. I have a problem with William Trevor, and I have a love/hate relationship with Anne Enright. I thought I should get to the bottom of this Irish writer phobia - on the other hand, I loved 'Never No More' by Maura Laverty - and the Northern Irish writer Janet McNeil - love her. Sebastian Barry - eugh. So obviously this is not a definitive analysis of all things Irish - there are many gaps - John Banville - no, Iris Murdoch yes, James Joyce - difficult, but 'Dubliners' - love love. Let's go back to Keegan and 'Foster'. It's only a 100 pages, so a long, short story, and it's very simple. The eldest daughter of a family is taken to some relatives, near the coast, county Wexford, for the summer. The girl's mother is expecting her 5th child and the absence of one child is to try and ease the burden on this family - Dan and Mary. We understand the material differences between the two families as the child experiences the comfort, order and cleanliness of her new home; and her temporary mother, Mrs Kinsella treats her with love and kindness. One day, however, the girl learns from a neighbour some of the recent past of the couple she stays with - a child has been lost - they are grieving. The problem I have with Irish writers is that I can hear or rather see through any false dialects or even the details of the farming life in rural Ireland. On turning to the back cover of this book I discover Keegan was born in 1968 in Wicklow. It's the same county where I spent most of my summer holidays - reading some of her stories from 'Antarctica' I can easily place her time line as around the 70s, maybe early 80s - so many elements of her stories are familiar to me. And in this one 'Foster' - it all rings true - it feels authentic. I can feel that - right down to the details of the 'floury potatoes' Kinsella brings from his farm for the hard-up Dan and wife, the girl's parents.Here are some extracts where I thought yes - that brings back memories - just little details that I recognize vividly. It's not just the authenticity of people and places, however, there are those subtle explorations of power that Keegan offers with impressive skill.'Give this to Mary,' she says, coming in. I'm snowed under with rhubarb, whatever kind of year it is.'My father takes it from her but it is as awkward as the baby in his arms. A stalk falls to the floor and then another. He waits for her to pick it up, to hand it to him. She waits for him to do it. Neither one of them will budge. In the end it's Kinsella who stoops to lift it. 'There now,' he says.Here is something that I totally loved - the couple take her to Gorey, the local town to buy her some new clothes after her Dad has gone and driven off with her things. Outside the shops, so many things are hanging in the sun. There are plastic nets full of beach balls, blow up toys. A see-through dolphin looks as though he is shivering in a cold breeze. There are plastic spades and matching buckets, moulds for sand castles, grown men digging ice cream out of tubs with little plastic spoons . . .They shop for clothes and a bit later in the same section:Out in the street, the sun feels strong again, blinding. Some part of me wishes it would go away, that it would cloud over so I could see properly. We meet people the woman knows. Some of those people stare at me and ask who I am. One of them has a new baby in a pushchair. Mrs Kinsella bends down and coos and he slobbers a little and starts to cry.'He's making strange,' the mother says. 'Pay no heed.'For me it's that description of the dolphin and then the sun, 'blinding' etc. Keegan depicts so well the tensions between the two couples. The girl's parents; Dan, who drinks and offers no help in the home. Kinsella, who treats the girl as his own and takes the time to explain to her why some people don't need to have all their questions answered.It's short - but remarkably well done. Everything gels, the time, the place, the attitudes; and the child's difficulty of observing the differences and her own preferences."
74,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110812-kinga,Rating 4 out of 5,"The first confusion is the cover and the title. Almost monochromatic, some children and ‘Foster’ written across in big letters. I was ready to dismiss it as another product of misery lit but before I turned away I noticed something about the ‘New Yorker’. As it turns out, Claire Keegan is an accomplished writer and ‘Foster’ appeared as a short story in the New Yorker before it appeared in a slightly expanded version as a stand-alone book. For a publisher to do something as reckless as to publish one short story in a separate book must mean it’s a true gem. The second confusion are the Irishisms - ‘What way are you?’ – how that confused me at first before I figured out it’s just Irish for ‘how are you?’. From then on I could just sit back, relax and enjoy this little thing. I remember I was reading it late at night, home alone, sprawled on the sofa, wondering if the rain would lull me to sleep before I finish reading. Keegan’s writing is very delicate and unassuming. This book would step back and let me sleep if I needed to. It would then gently penetrate the periphery of my dreams.In one of the interviews Keegan said: ""It's essentially about trusting in the reader's intelligence rather than labouring a point. To work on the level of suggestion is what I aim for in all my writing.""What we know of the story is what we fill the gaps with. A little girl is brought by her father to spend the summer with the Kinsellas on a farm. Only through her reactions we learn how different her life at home is to what she experiences with her temporary foster parents. It’s a different sort of farm and a different sort of parents. For those summer months she is the only child suddenly, valued, appreciated and cherished. Yet, there is no gut-wrenching drama (that the cover would imply). The most emotional moment for me was a scene at the beach where the girl was taken by her foster father. On the way back he is trying to retrace his steps but he can’t find his own footprints, only the girl’s. So he says“You must have carried me there.” "

I wonder what it will be like, this place belonging to the Kinsellas. I see a tall woman standing over me, making me drink milk still hot from the cow. I see another, less likely version of her in an apron, pouring pancake batter onto a frying pan, asking would I like another, the way my mother sometimes does when she is in good humour. The man will be no taller than her. He will take me to town on the tractor and buy me red lemonade and crisps. Or he’ll make me clean out sheds and pick stones and pull ragweed and docks out of the fields. I see him taking what I hope will be a fifty pence piece from his pocket but it turns out to be a handkerchief. I wonder if they live in an old farmhouse or a new bungalow, whether they will have an outhouse or an indoor bathroom with a toilet and running water. I picture myself lying in a dark bedroom with other girls, saying things we won’t repeat when morning comes.
Foster is quite short (it took about an hour to read) but it contains an entire novel’s worth of story and emotional depth. Set in the early ‘80s in rural County Wexford, Ireland, a young girl is sent to live with an aunt and uncle she has never met while her overworked mother prepares for the birth of her fifth child. I do love an Irish storyteller, and Foster delighted me in setting and voice. Author Claire Keegan packs so much into this — between what is written and what remains unsaid — and in no small measure, it filled and broke my heart. A complete pleasure, I will definitely read Keegan again. (Note: I read an ARC of an impending, expanded rerelease of Foster through NetGalley and passages quoted may not be in their final forms.)
And so the days pass. I keep waiting for something to happen, for the ease I feel to end: to wake in a wet bed, to make some blunder, some big gaffe, to break something, but each day follows on much like the one before.
As the novel begins, the girl (unnamed) is driven to the farm of her mother’s sister and unceremoniously dropped off by the father who we eventually learn is lazy and feckless and given to drink and gambling. The girl is dirty and anxious and used to work and want, but as her aunt and uncle — who have no children of their own — take loving and empathetic care of her, the girl begins to blossom into happiness. Some secrets will be revealed, some will remain hidden, and throughout, Keegan leaves hints of what the girl’s life must have been at home:
‘You should wash your hands and face before you go to town,’ he says. ‘Didn’t your father even bother to teach you that much?’ I freeze in the chair, waiting for something much worse to happen, but Kinsella does nothing more; he just stands there, locked in the wash of his own speech.
As the summer plays out, her aunt enlists the girl to help with genial household chores and her uncle makes a game out of timing her as she races to the mailbox at the end of the lane for him:
‘It’d be a swift man that would catch you, long legs. We’ll try you again tomorrow and see if we can’t improve your time.’‘I’ve to go faster?’‘Oh aye,’ he says. ‘By the time this summer ends you’ll be like a reindeer. There’ll not be a man in the parish will catch you without a long-handled net and a racing bike.’
Eventually, and as expected, her mother gives birth and the Kinsellas are asked to drive the girl back to her crowded, chaotic life; and as loyal as she does remain to her mother, the girl understands that she can never reveal the details of her happy weeks of “foster care”:
‘Nothing happened .’ This is my mother I am speaking to but I have learned enough, grown enough, to know that what happened is not something I need ever mention. It is my perfect opportunity to say nothing.
Ultimately, this makes you question what’s best for the girl: Of course she was expected to return home when her parents were ready to care for her again (although, as the oldest, maybe it doesn’t make complete sense that she hadn’t been needed at home to help care for her younger siblings as her mother became incapacitated), but she had such a lovely and loving summer — with family who were so pleased to have a child in the house — that I couldn’t help but feel bad for her return. This story amused and affected me in the moment, and left me thinking about it long after the last page was turned, and I can see why it was an award winner when it was first released."

Effectively word perfect I described it in my review as a gem of a novel and commented ""it also thankfully acts as a counter example to two if the most pernicious trends in literary fiction: that quality is correlated to length and literary merit to being transgressive or misanthropic.""This story is if anything even more compact and powerful and was originally published as a New Yorker story (in a slightly more abbreviated version -https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/20...) in 2010, it has become part of the Irish leaving Certificate and was also in 2022 adapted into a n equally critically acclaimed film - the Irish language “The Quiet girl""For more details on the book which is about a young girl fostered for a Summer to a childless couple, I would recommend this resource (https://vinhanley.com/2017/12/19/stud...) but most of all I would recommend reading it.One is tempted to say that rather than being on the Irish Leaving Certificate it should be compulsory on all Creative Writing courses and one of the better known lines in the book 'You don't ever have to say anything,' he says.'Always remember that as a thing you need never do. Many's the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing'Could be changed toMany's the author lost much just because they missed a perfect opportunity to leave something to the reader’s imagination.Finally this book was one of my Jólabókaflóð gifts in 2022 and formed a perfect read for Christmas Eve.
'See, there's three lights now where there was only two before.'I look out across the sea. There, the two lights are blinking as before, but with another, steady light, shining in between.'Can you see it? he says.I can.' I say. 'It's there.'And that is when he puts his arms around me and gathers me into them as though I werehis own.

This is a short story of a young girl that is sent to live with foster parents on a farm in rural Wexford Ireland. It is a journey through childhood innocence but also of loss and hope. Keegan’s powerful lyrical prose is penetrating. Her ability to make a simple story so relevant is uncanny. “This water is cool and clean as anything I have ever tasted: it tastes of my father leaving, of him never been there, of having nothing after he was gone.”Thank you JimZ for the recommendation.

The first, Small Thing Like These, I listened to and in thinking about realized I missed much of what other reviews had commented on. So for my second I decided to read the print. I did feel this made all the difference in enjoying the author's gift at description and just using the right words to impart an image that gave the story such life. But then I had to listen to it, to hear the wonderful story told by the lovely Irish voice of Aoife McMahon and now I can't decide which I liked best.The story is of a young girl left in the home of relatives (strangers to her) and the summer her world opens for her. The reader is never quite sure of her age (I guessed about 7 or 8) and the transformation love and caring can make. There was certainly much packed into 96 pages and I related to a lot of it even being in my 70's. 4.5 stars rounded up for the several phrases I had to copy out and set to memory.

Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing'Of her wonderful Orwell Prize winning novel Small Things Like These I commented that it was ""a beautifully judged novel from Claire Keegan, the sort of exquisitely crafted book one hopes creative teaching writers thrust in the hands of their MFA students as an exemplar"". And the same applies here, although Keegan herself has this as a long short story. The laconic, compassionate and wise, Kinsella (I was reminded of Sean Kelly, who in the 1981 in which the novel is set was a year away from his own golden years) is the perfect model for Keegan's own writing. Stage 15 of the 1981 Tour de FranceAnd the media critics who seemed obsessed with an overblown and overlong Irish novel that, in their view, should have won the Booker, would benefit from reading this as well.Early on a Sunday, after first Mass in Clonegal, my father, instead of taking me home, drives deep into Wexford toward the coast, where my mother's people came from. It is a hot August day, bright, with patches of shade and greenish sudden light along the road. We pass through the village of Shillelagh, where my father lost our red shorthorn in a game of forty-five, and on past the mart in Carnew, where the man who won her sold her not long afterward. My father throws his hat on the passenger seat, winds down the window, and smokes. I shake the plaits out of my hair and lie flat on the back seat, looking up through the rear window. I wonder what it will be like, this place belonging to the Kinsellas. I see a tall woman standing over me, making me drink milk still hot from the cow. I see another, less likely version of her, in an apron, pouring pancake batter into a frying pan, asking would I like another, the way my mother sometimes does when she is in good humor. The man will be her size. He will take me to town on the tractor and buy me red lemonade and crisps. Or he'll make me clean out sheds and pick stones and pull ragweed and docks out of the fields. I wonder if they live in an old farmhouse or a new bungalow, whether they will have an outhouse or an indoor bathroom, with a toilet and running water. "

94,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6942006-suzy,Rating 5 out of 5,"Another short, powerful book - my current favorite genre. I've concluded that after reading this and Small Things Like These that Claire Keegan is the master of uncertainty and ambiguity, for both the characters and the reader alike. This story, told in first person by an unnamed girl of an indeterminate age (maybe 8 or 9?), starts after Mass with her da taking her to Wexford ""where my mother's people come from"". She muses:""I wonder what it will be like, this place belonging to the Kinsellas. I see a tall woman standing over me, making me drink milk still hot from the cow. I see another, less likely version of her in an apron, pouring pancake batter onto a frying pan, asking would I like another, the way my mother sometimes does when she is in good humour. The man will be no taller than her. He will take me to town on the tractor and buy me red lemonade."" And on and on she imagines what this arrangement for her to stay with the Kinsellas will be like, having no frame of reference except how life is being part of a large family, one with another baby on the way, where she seems just another mouth to feed and child to clothe. Keegan then spins a tale, in her trademark spare language, of exactly what the girl's experience is like over the next few months. For 92 pages, I had tears just behind my eyes, a lump in my throat and an ache in my heart for all three of these characters, Mr. and Mrs. Kinsella and our unnamed narrator. Keegan gives sometimes direct and more often vague references to everyone's backstory yet keeps the focus on these main characters and how they adjust and adapt to each other in their new circumstances. When the end came (and it came very quicky!), it was another of Keegan's masterful ambiguous and heart stopping endings that leaves the reader imagining, just like the girl, what comes next. This was another book where I wanted to go back to the beginning immediately upon finishing to have the benefit of the experience again. Indeed, I put the audiobook on hold to have just that. I just learned from s.penkvich's masterful and poignant  review that an Irish language film has been made of this story, The Quiet Girl. It's getting all kinds of award nominations and wins! Will be in wide release in theaters in the U.S. in February 2023. Why I'm reading this: I put this on hold at my library as soon as I saw they were making it available. Finally came through!"

Its language settles in your belly and then your bones only seconds after it has passed your eyes.”Lynn Steger Strong ~ Los Angeles TimesMagical and devastating.Earthbound yet cinematic.

Although Foster feels like a timeless fable, a brief mention of IRA hunger strikers dates it to 1981. It bears all the hallmarks of a book several times its length: a convincing and original voice, rich character development, an evocative setting, just enough backstory, psychological depth, conflict and sensitive treatment of difficult themes like poverty and neglect. I finished the one-sitting read in a flood of tears, hoping the Kinsellas’ care might be enough to protect the girl from the harshness she may face in the rest of her growing-up years. Keegan unfolds a cautionary tale of endangered childhood, also hinting at the enduring difference a little compassion can make.See my full review at BookBrowse.

“You don’t ever have to say anything,’ he says. ‘Always remember that as a thing you need never do. Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.”
The ability to capture such tender emotions in an achingly raw yet simple setting in few words is a rare gift that very few excel at - Claire Keegan's Foster is a beautifully written example of that. There is something not quite different, but still so very distinctive about her style of writing that makes it so very unique and have the ability to tug at your heart-strings, as it did mine. 🤍The story of Foster takes place during the summer of 1981 in rural Ireland, where a young girl is dropped off at her relatives' house, while her parents welcome a new sibling into their family. The Kinsellas are an ordinary couple, who welcome her into their home, with acts, that in her eyes, are extraordinary. 🙏🏼 It is the quaint and simple depiction of their farm lifestyle, the fostering of affection and simple gestures of kindness that these relatives bestow upon her, awaken a sense of belonging in the young girl's heart - that she matters - that the impoverished and neglected life she had with her family, can be something different. It is a short story, but a deeply poignant and moving one - one that makes you look at how the title has a much deeper meaning to the story. 🤌🏼 🤌🏼 “Kinsella takes my hand in his. As soon as he takes it, I realise my father has never once held my hand, and some part of me wants Kinsella to let me go so I won’t have to feel this. It’s a hard feeling but as we walk along I begin to settle and let the difference between my life at home and the one I have here be.”With a wistful touch and a yearning sense of something more meaningful to happen, Ms.Keegan's quiet writing invites the reader into a family life that was once blessed with happiness, but never lost their ability or desire to still gift that feeling of acceptance to others. The simple joys of childhood, the comforting touch, the firm but gentle reprimand are echoes of parents who are so very eager and willing to give it to this young girl who never knew such gifts were provided. 🥺🥺 At first it is with a hesitant and fearful approach, the girl goes about the daily activities that are tasked to her - that she feels she has to earn her keep to belong. But through her innocent eyes, we start to see the subtle changes - the strengthening of her bond with them - her steady realization that she has been welcomed that she need 'never, ever tell' - that she has 'learned enough, grown enough, to know that what happened is not something I need ever mention. It is my perfect opportunity to say nothing.' Because, there are people who truly do good - simply from the kindness of their hearts, without ever asking for anything in return. 😢😢There are two key moments that stole my heart for me - that spoke volumes greater than the sparse words the author used to evoke the profound sadness of a child on the cusp of being 'in a spot where I can neither be what I always am nor turn into what I could be.' 💔 That scene, where the young girl ventures into the recesses of the waters - and she gets the haunting glimpses of a young life that once graced these very lands - that brought the happiness to the couple taking care of her - to be so plain, to simply say it was so heart-breaking doesn't do it justice - but, it truly was.And that ending... 🤧🤧 For it was in that heart-wrenching ending, upon her return home that the title truly breaks you - that through her stay with this foster family, it inevitably reaches into her heart and makes it her true family. And you don't just read it happen - for there is more weight in things left unspoken - you feel it - you witness that rebirth taking place in her mind and in her heart. 🤍🤍 “My heart does not so much feel that it is in my chest as in my hands, and that I am carrying it along swiftly, as though I have become the messenger for what is going on inside of me.”"

Maybe I should stick with scary stuff?It’s not that I didn’t like it; I didn’t like the writing style, but it looks like I’m in the minority on that. It was a decent story, a sad story, but nothing that blew my mind. A young girl in Ireland goes and stays with another couple while her mom is pregnant, they are kind to her for many reasons, then it’s over. 🤷🏼‍♀️Like I said, this is fine, but I just wasn’t a huge fan. Luckily, it was a shorter story and a very quick read. It was a little cute, quite depressing, and the ending was slightly confusing. Maybe you’ll love it more, though. Three stars for one that just didn’t grab me like I’d hoped it would.(Thank you to Grove Atlantic, Claire Keegan, and NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for my review.

A young, un-named girl is taken to live with relatives she does not know while her family prepares for the birth of another child. It is there that she learns what it is to be cared for and looked after. The husband and the wife treat her kindly and with respect and encouragement. Having come from a large family with few resources, this is all new to the child. However, the relatives have a loss of their own which is not spoken of but is gradually brought to light in a very delicate touching way. At the end of the summer, the girl is returned to her family and the ending is incredibly poignant. This book and author show how powerful a small story can be.

120,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"A deeply touching, perfect gem of a book about growing up and seeing things in new ways. To be honest, I am at a loss for words to describe what ""Foster"" is and how it works on the reader's mind and emotions. To say it is subtle in its brilliance and acuity is accurate but does nothing to convey strength of this very short novella, of Keegan's ability to convey so much in so few words. The protagonist, a young girl, is left with some relatives while her mother gives birth. So much of what she experiences there is new to her, unexpected, and brings up complicated feelings. She immediately senses the difference between this place and her home, though she doesn't always have the words or perspective to sort out what the difference is. ""I am,"" she thinks, ""in a spot where I can neither be what I always am nor turn into what I could be."" We watch her struggle to make sense of her new circumstances and the emotions she is feeling. When ""the woman,"" as she describes one of her hosts, bathes her she thinks, ""Her hands are like my mother’s hands but there is something else in them too, something I have never felt before and have no name for. I feel at such a loss for words but this is a new place, and new words are needed."" Keegan makes us privy to the child's complicated feelings. In one exchange, the woman tells her she's too young to understand something, and the girl feels a flash of resentment: ""As soon as she says this, I realise she is just like everyone else, and wish I was back at home so that all the things I do not understand could be the same as they always are.”Another moment has her reacting to what she feels when Kinsella, her other host, shows affection: ""Kinsella takes my hand in his. As soon as he takes it, I realise my father has never once held my hand, and some part of me wants Kinsella to let me go so I won’t have feel this.""I could share other examples of tender beauty in this book, like the perfect and suggestive moment of synesthesia that comes when she drinks from a well: ""This water is cool and clean as anything I have ever tasted: it tastes of my father leaving, of him never having been there, of having nothing after he was gone.""But enough. To call ""Foster"" lovely is to diminish it and make it seem a thin, pale thing. To say it is perfect, as I have, risks making it sound hard and inhuman. So I will just praise it, celebrate it, and wait eagerly for the audio version so I can experience anew.My thanks to Grove Press and and Edelweis for providing a digital ARC in return for an honest review."

This novella speaks both to the good in people and to the good that people can do. A young, insecure girl, who is a victim of parental neglect, goes to live temporarily with her relatives, who desperately need someone to love. Her relatives are the kind of guardians that every child should have, and that everyone with children should aspire to be. 
Her Birth Parents
They have more children than they want, and a new baby is on the way. Her “father,” if he can be called that, is a drunk who is never around. “Why did he leave without so much as good-bye, without ever mentioning that he would come back for me?”
Her Foster Parents
They love her, want to spend time with her, and work hard to show her that she is accepted and loved. For example, after she wets the bed accidently, her foster mother responds:“These old mattresses … they weep. They’re always weeping. What was I thinking of, putting you on this?”

Nicht so bei ""Das dritte Licht"" von Claire Keegan. Die Autorin schafft es ergreifend und realistisch von einem Mädchen zu erzählen, das für einen Sommer zu Pflegeeltern kommt. Es sind die frühen 80er Jahre auf einem irischen Bauernhof. Das Mädchen kommt aus einer ärmlichen, lieblosen Familie. Die Mutter erwartet ein Kind. Das ist der Anlass, das Mädchen für einige Zeit zu dem kinderlosen Ehepaar Kinsella zu geben. Hier erlebt das aus der Verwahrlosung kommende Mädchen einen wunderbaren Sommer. Zum ersten Mal erfährt es Liebe. Auch wenn es ein dunkles Geheimnis im Leben ihrer temporären Pflegeeltern gibt. Die Geschichte wird im Präsens sensibel und behutsam erzählt. Sie ist berührend, aber niemals sentimental oder gar kitschig. Die Umstände und im Besonderen das Geheimnis der Kinsellas hätten Gelegenheit für eine dramatische Herangehensweise gegeben.

 ""You don’t ever have to say anything,’ he says. ‘Always remember that as a thing you need never do. Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.""

Claire Keegan's novella Foster is a thoughtful rumination on family dynamics, isolation & displacement, and the complexities of finding your own identity as a child. Set in rural Ireland, the story unfolds through the perspective of a young girl temporarily placed with a foster family during the summer. Over the course of one fast-paced story, Keegan crafts a touching and intimate portrayal of the girl's experiences. Familial bonds vs. the harshness of life, belonging vs. alienation—it's astonishing to me how much Keegan was able to convey through such a short piece of literature. Her prose is lyrical and evocative, transporting you into life on a farm and making you feel part of this curious family.In the end, what struck me about Foster most was Keegan's understanding of the meaning of brief encounters. The quiet girl's visit with the foster family lasted only one summer, but the effects of this particular summer on her character will last a lifetime, a fundamental component of her upbringing and the formation of her identity.

She wants to find the good in others, and sometimes her way of finding that is to trust them, hoping she’ll not be disappointed, but she sometimes is.

The girl is left with the Kinsella family, the father returns to her mother, soon to give birth again. There is no goodbye or word of when he might return. This is Ireland. Remember Nora Webster and all that is unspoken?So begins Claire Keegan's long, short story Foster, a vivid telling of the period following a girl being fostered into a family in rural Ireland. In the stranger's home she finds an atmosphere unlike that which she is used to, one she enjoys and becomes used to, though always there is the presence of that feeling that it might soon all be taken from her.'When I follow the woman back inside, I want her to say something, to put my mind at ease. Instead, she clears the table, picks up the sharp knife and stands in the light under the window, washing the blade under the running tap.'Seen and heard from the perspective of the girl, we learn the circumstances of both families that led to this situation. They fall into a regular routine, life settles in this new family and nothing appears to happen to destroy the ease with which the girl has come to know.There is a strange atmosphere throughout the book, it is the anticipation of something, we, like the girl, are wondering and waiting for it to happen. For she seems like the pawn on the chess board, her parents on one side having handed her over, the foster parents on the other having received her. Each move, every event that is outside the daily routine, ignites in the girl heightened powers of observation, developing an acute awareness of even the most subtle changes in those around her.'Kinsella looks at me and smiles a hard kind of a smile then looks over to the window ledge where a sparrow has come down to perch and readjust her wings. The little bird seems uneasy - as though she can scent the cat, who sometimes sits there. Kinsella's eyes are not quite still in his head. It's as though there's a big piece of trouble stretching itself out in the back of his mind. He toes the leg of a chair and looks over at me.'A touching and yet eerie telling of a story that begs to be read and reread, the writing is exquisite in its depiction and ability to create a taut atmosphere without significant plot, it showcases an author with an immense talent for the short story and makes the reader want more.Claire Keegan is an Irish writer highly regarded for her award-winning short stories, she has published two collections Antarctica (1999) and Walk the Blue Fields (2007)."

In FOSTER, the nameless narrator is a child, sent by her impoverished parents to live with distant relatives in Wexford. The young child has no idea when she will be going back home again. Her mother is about to give birth to another baby, adding to their already large brood. Her father is a no-good loser caring for no one, thinking only of himself. He drops off our narrator to the Kinsellas, Edna and John, out in the hinterlands. They give her a dignified life, a room of her own, and space to breathe. She also has plenty of food at meal and tea times, enough to pluck from the earth, to cook, to eat and to permit her to grow. Secrets are discouraged and no one need be shamed. This artless story portrays a liminal period for a child that, simply by being herself, is enough to deeply touch us, to evoke our empathy with her steady forbearance. Spaces are never empty, voices are never alone, days march forward and give us more to count on. This new life contrasts with the girl’s former childhood neglect, and the pain of knowing that is sometimes intensified, even as this new family embraces her with affection. Keegan doesn’t implement time, but her characters modestly mark time’s graceless lethality, and its measure for mercy. The drama is between the lines, in the hush of the gesture, the unspoken depths. A secret is later revealed by a gossipy neighbor regarding the Kinsellas, and the child quickly kens the profound but featherweight fragility of life. As I steadily read on, I was consumed with the weight of emotion, a heft ten times the number of these lightly held pages. Keegan’s talent for unveiling the world in a word is stunning. I was carried gently to the finale, to a potent winged word that punctured all the narrative tension, and undid me; it utterly cracked me open."

Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.”As an inveterate “oversharer” and a person who thinks they need to fill nearly every silence with words, I’m a slower learner in the art of saying nothing. This idea/thought struck me hard for several reasons - some being personal, I suspect. But the art of withholding information - of telling through not telling - is definitely one of the hallmarks of Keegan’s storytelling style. I marvel at how much she tells us, or even just suggests to us, with carefully chosen details and a few select words. She doesn’t explain everything, or belabour her points, and yet her spare writing aches with emotion. This is a simple story of a childless couple who foster a young girl for a few months because her own mother is about to give birth to yet another child. We know, through one simple line about the IRA prisoners on hunger strikes, that this book is set in 1981 (or near enough), and yet 1980s Ireland could be 1890s Ireland in some ways. One family has more children than they can feed or emotionally nurture, and another has love and food to spare but no children.

146,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59161878-laura-rogers,Rating 4 out of 5,"Foster is a jewel of a book that proves that good things come in small packages. It is a study in contrasts where one household, one family is found wanting in every way and the other is full of everything good and loving. It is the difference between a child being seen as a burden versus a gift to be cherished. Keegan has given us a beautiful story of poverty and indifference, heartbreaking loss and shining love, not spoken aloud but shown in a hundred small ways. It is a story where a young, introverted girl thrives and matures in her found family and, as a result, she will always see the world through this new lens. It is the love that will stay with me and though it ends as it must, I can't help but imagine the story into the future. Could we have a sequel, please! I received a drc from the publisher via Netgalley."

Uma história de ternura, de amor, de carinho… acolher é mesmo isso. Gosto muito da forma como a autora escreve: deixa-nos perceber o que não está escrito. Já tinha sentido isso no maravilhoso “Pequenas coisas como estas”. Foi a última leitura de 2023 e recomendo tanto!! "

151,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4793025-martie-nees-record,Rating 5 out of 5,"Genre: Coming of Age Irish NovellaPublisher: Grove AtlanticPub. Date: November 1, 2022“Foster” is a heartbreaking but humane story about parents and children in Ireland. Though the year is not mentioned, politics suggests that we are in the 1980s. As with the author’s “Small Things Like These,” which was a Booker Prize long-listed novel, this novella is also both concise and gut-wrenching. In seemingly simple prose, Keegan explores class differences through a child’s eyes. Due to her mother's recent pregnancy and the stress of feeding their huge family, a young unnamed girl is sent to live with Mr. and Mrs. Kinsella, the girl’s childless relatives that she never met. We learn that the girl's parents have a history of ignoring her. They didn't tell her when or if she would return home. When dropping the child off, her father tells them, “She’ll ate, but ye can work her.” When her uncle replies, “there will be no need for that here,” we know she is now with a very different kind of family. Keegan’s lyrical novella might be considered a class in child narration. Like the character, Francie Nolan in “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,” our girl’s voice also is never precocious and walks the perfect balance between naïveté and innate intelligence. Keegan does not always tell us what the girl’s thoughts mean; her subtle suggestions are perhaps even more potent. “When the girl accompanies Mrs. Kinsella to milk the cows, she observes inwardly, I can hear them pulling the grass up from the roots. The breeze, crossing the rim of the bucket, whispers sometimes as we walk along. Neither one of us talks, the way people sometimes don’t when they are happy — but as soon as I have this thought, I realize its opposite is also true.”Our unnamed protagonist, whose age we do not know, shares the same long legs as her mother and aunt. One of the many tender moments is when her uncle introduces her to running. His love is not stated, merely implied by taking time out of his farm duties to clock her runs. “By the time this summer’s end you’ll be like a reindeer.” With ""room and time to think,"" she realizes that she enjoys the sport and the challenge of beating her time. This struck a nerve for me because it’s the kind of reading that motivates parents to do better for their children. Foster is a treasure with pitch-perfect writing that will take you on a roller coaster of emotions—expect to shed tears while looking at the injustices of poverty, lack of education, and the damage that shame can bring. Mrs. Kinsella whispers to the sleeping girl, “If you were mine, I’d never leave you in a house with strangers.” Keegan quietly pulls on our heartstrings. This is the sort of book that, once you finish, you immediately want to start reading again to see if you missed anything.I received this Advance Review Copy (ARC) novel from the publisher at no cost in exchange for an honest review.Find all my book reviews at:https://books6259.wordpress.comhttps://www.goodreads.comhttps://twitter.com/NeesRecordhttps://www.amazon.comhttps://www.facebook.com/martie.neesr...https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/c..."

Deze in 1968 geboren Ierse debuteerde in 1999 met haar verhalenbundel Antarctica, waarna in 2007 een tweede bundel volgde. Het vorig jaar verschenen Dit soort kleinigheden is bijzonder goed ontvangen, iets wat geldt voor al haar werk. Onlangs kwam Pleegkind uit, een oorspronkelijk in 2009 gepubliceerd kort verhaal dat prijswinnend bleek. Dit lange korte verhaal telt 86 kleine pagina’s tekst met een vrij groot lettertype. Het is niet veel, maar wat zij schrijft is wel bijzonder mooi.Weinig woorden nodigKeegan valt meteen met de deur in huis.“Op een zondagochtend brengt mijn vader me niet zoals altijd meteen na de vroegmis in Clonegale naar huis, maar rijdt hij dwars door Wexford naar het plaatsje aan de kust waar de familie van mijn moeder oorspronkelijk vandaan komt.”Het naamloze meisje wordt ondergebracht bij haar tante. Haar moeder is weer eens hoogzwanger en kan geen tijd aan haar andere kinderen besteden. Tussen de regels door kun je uit de eerste pagina’s al wat conclusies trekken. Zij komt uit een straatarm gezin:“We komen door het dorp Shillelagh, waar mijn vader onze shorthorn verspeelde met klaverjassen.”Pa heeft in ieder geval last van een gokverslaving, een plausibele verklaring voor die armoede. Zoals vaker voorkomt met verslaafden probeert hij dat te verhullen. Als het gaat over de hoeveelheid hooi zegt hij dat “de hooizolder tot de nok toe vol ligt.” Het meisje weet wel beter:“Ik vraag me af waarom mijn vader liegt over het hooi.”Waaruit je meteen kunt opmaken dat zij een scherp oog heeft voor wat in haar omgeving gebeurt. Pa vertrekt, het meisje blijft achter, maar zonder spullen. Haar vader is ‘vergeten’ om haar koffer uit te laden.Het meisje ondergaat een opknapbeurt qua hygiëne, voedsel, kleding en aandacht. Het Pleegkind bloeit op door de warmte en de genegenheid die zij ervaart. Maar ook dat gezin heeft zo zijn geheimen. Als zij hierover hoort, zet dat haar aan het denken. Het geeft een extra laag aan de manier waarop het pleeggezin haar bejegent.Pijnlijk mooi eindeAls haar vader na een paar maanden belt, gaat zij terug naar huis. Met haar oom Dan rijdt zij weer door Shillelagh en zegt: “Daar heeft papa de rooie vaars met kaarten verloren.” Het is weliswaar nieuws voor haar oom en tante, maar het verrast hen niet.De ontvangst door haar vader is veelzeggend, het eerste wat hij vraagt: “Is ze nog lastig geweest?” In de paar laatste pagina’s wordt dat er niet beter op. Het pijnlijk mooie einde laat zien dat het Pleegkind, het machteloze meisje, voorvoelt hoe haar toekomst eruit zal zien.Weer is Keegan erin geslaagd om met heel weinig woorden een prachtig verhaal te vertellen waarin meer gebeurt dan in veel vuistdikke romans. Zij schrijft niet alles uit, verklaart weinig en laat veel ruimte aan de lezer voor eigen interpretatie. Geen overbodig woord, alles doet ertoe, Pleegkind is een fraai kunststukje, sober, veelzeggend en schrijnend."

Scritta con una profondità emotiva che inevitabilmente crea un legame straziante con la protagonista, il libro tenero e nostalgico è impreziosito da una prosa semplice e toccante che descrive con cura i personaggi e la rurale Wexford, talmente vivida da essere facilmente immaginabile C'è un'atmosfera strana in tutto il romanzo, come fosse l'anticipazione di qualcosa, e noi lettori, come la protagonista, ce lo chiediamo e aspettiamo che avvengaLa protagonista sembra una pedina sulla scacchiera e ogni mossa, ogni evento che esce dalla routine quotidiana, accende nella giovane un forte spirito di osservazione e la consapevolezza di saper cogliere i cambiamenti più sottili in coloro che la circondano. “C’è una grossa luna che splende sull’aia, e come un tratto di gesso segna il nostro tragitto fino al sentiero e lungo la strada.

154,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5052439-wulf-krueger,Rating 5 out of 5,"""Foster"" by Claire Keegan is a short story about (parental) love. A girl from an economically-challenged family is sent to relatives, Mrs. and Mr. Kinsella (who have lost their only child), to be temporarily cared for. The Kinsellas seem to be slightly better off than the girl’s parents but certainly not much.The strength of this short story lies in what’s implied: From the very beginning the unnamed girl is treated with kindness. When she wets her bed, her foster mother scolds herself (and the mattress!) for putting the girl on an old “weeping” mattress and simply goes on to clean it with the girl's help.The girl’s foster father takes her on a walk and while talking to her, gives her all the room to respond or to remain silent (and explicitly tells her so) - whatever the girl needs. He simply takes her hand and guides her along her way. Letting her go and return, letting himself be carried by the girl’s quiet joy...During her stay over the summer, the girl lives through completely ordinary situations but the Kinsellas do not just give her food and lodging but share their lives and love. They completely open up to the girl and allow themselves to feel for her and treat her like the girl was their own child.The girl herself realises her own incipient tender feelings only at the very end of this story.The writing is immaculate, the pacing is great and the length of less than 15.000 words is perfect. This is probably the most emotional, tender, and kind short story I’ve read so far.Five out of five stars for the shortest masterpiece I’ve read. Highly recommended!Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest | Medium | Matrix | TumblrCeterum censeo Putin esse delendam"
155,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9582364-andrea,Rating 4 out of 5,"Republished to coincide with the release of The Quiet Girl movie, this small but emotionally deep story conveys as much in what it doesn't say, as in what it does.‘You don’t ever have to say anything,’ he [Kinsella] says. ‘Always remember that as a thing you need never do. Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.’A father drives his young daughter deep into County Wexford to leave her with distant relatives - strangers to the girl - for reasons, and for a length of time, she hasn't been told. Her siblings have stayed at home with their mother, heavily pregnant with yet another not-really-wanted child. John & Edna Kinsella are a kind, childless older couple, who quickly begin to open the girl's eyes to what it is like to live in an environment where warmth and love abound. But the Kinsellas have a tragic secret and when the girl is told the details by a gossiping neighbour, her fragile contentment begins to crumble.Somewhere between a short-story and a novella, this book can easily be read in one sitting, and will be all the more powerful if that's how it's consumed. I can't stop thinking about it, and the ambiguous ending now has me desperate to see the film to see how it has been interpreted for the screen.With thanks to NetGalley and Grove Atlantic for a copy to read and review."

Dies gelang ihr bei Kleine Dinge wie diese, das ich letzten Sommer gelesen habe. Bei Das dritte Licht waren meine Tränen am Ende sogar fast noch stärker.An einem Sommertag in den frühen 80er-Jahren in Irland wird ein kleines Mädchen von seinem Vater bei einem kinderlosen Ehepaar abgegeben, mit dem seine Familie weitläufig verwandt ist. Es soll dort auf unbestimmte Zeit bleiben, da ein weiteres Baby unterwegs ist und die Familie möchte nicht noch ein weiteres Maul stopfen müssen. Das Mädchen ist zunächst sehr verschüchtert, lebt sich aber schnell ein und wird zu einem ganz anderen Menschen. Denn bei ihren Zieheltern erfährt sie etwas, das es Zuhause nicht gab: Liebe. Doch irgendwann ist jeder Sommer zu Ende und das Mädchen muss wieder nach Hause.Auch beim schreiben dieser Rezension kämpfe ich noch mit den Tränen.

Frases cortas, descripciones precisas y sin apenas entrar en juicios de valor, ni de los protagonistas, ni del entorno, ni de las cosas que cuenta cada personaje. Me ha encantado.Entrando en el fondo, digamos que es un librito muy tierno y que sugiere más de lo que dice. La narración juega mucho con las emociones y sentimientos. Esa primera persona que narra desde la perspectiva de una niña es fantástica. No parece pecar (no mucho, al menos) del fallo de obras parecidas, en que la perspectiva del niño/a a veces la olvida el narrador y entra en cuestiones que jamás entraría un niño pequeño, se ve la mano del adulto detrás. Aquí no.Profundizando un poco más en los temas que toca, apenas insinuados, creo que aborda una clara contraposición entre dos formas opuestas de entender la infancia y la educación por parte de los adultos: bien con ternura y paciencia (como una bendición), o bien con resignación y desgana, con prisas (como una carga). Ese error extendido de que los niños no perciben esto, se encuentra presente en la narración."

When she is sent to a farm for the summer, she experiences true caring for the first time in her life. Kindness and affection are new to her experience and she laps them up - though always with a grain of suspicion that this cannot last.The story spoke to the age old need to be loved and valued. It was sad and moving portrayed by eloquently drawn characters, spare poignant prose, and a deep understanding of human needs.The setting, rural Wexford, Ireland was splendidly described and easily imagined.Written with an emotional depth that evokes a heart-breaking connection to the protagonist, I absolutely loved this novella, and wished it were longer..."

I really like her understated writing - not a word wasted but with such depth of feeling and insight. Here, she uses just the right words, in just the right number, to describe a summer in the life of the narrator, a young Irish girl sometime in the 1980s or so who is dropped off to spend it with relatives she doesn't know. Her own home is evidently crowded and chaotic, rough and lacking in care. The home of the Kinsellas by contrast is quiet and orderly, the adults attentive to her needs: these are adults who match her spirit well, and who are happy to have her. Yet the close of summer in a child's life often signals change and return. Beautiful. 4.5."

For the first time in her short life, our protagonist is lovingly nurtured and encouraged and included. We never learn her actual name but know her through the kind endearments the Kinsellas use for her: leanbh (“baby girl”), Petal, good girl, girleen. In her crowded home in Clonegal, she is called “you” and wets her bed and worries about breaking things. She doesn’t know how long she will be allowed to stay in this place of peace and so takes nothing for granted.

I found this story to be one of encouragement and possibility for the nameless child protagonist, but I would have preferred a more concrete ending. The prose was very good in this story and the author had me liking the good guys and disliking the bad guys. The story line was easy enough to follow, but it ended up being incomplete for me. A young girl was taken by relatives for the summer due to her over crowded household deep in poverty. With the relatives she learned love and acceptance, along with respect, tidiness and cleanliness. Knowing this new life, as autumn drew near and she was taken home, she knew she faced neglect, hardship, and poverty once again. And that is how it ended. I feel cheated when an author ends a story like this one did. I open a book to READ a story, the authors imagination - not to play fill in the blanks. "

A little girl is sent to live with a new family in Ireland. She knows nothing about the reason or strangers in rural Ireland who welcome her with loads of love and affection. She is surprised by the love they give her (something she has never had) and begins to bloom. However, she is unsure of how things stand when the reason is finally revealed. This is a short book brimming with emotions and beautiful prose that reflect the complexity of human life. The story comes from the nameless girl’s POV. Oh, what do I say? I’ve become a fan of the author’s writing after reading Small Things Like These last year. This book is no different and packs a punch in less than 90 pages. We have a little girl of probably seven or eight years who tells us what she feels, thinks, and understands during her stay with the Kinsellas. There is so much to the story than the given plot line. We see an undernourished girl have a better life for a few days. It’s not just the food either. It’s nourishment in all forms- care, affection, correction, gentle advice, and love. The writing is evocative yet understated. Most of the story relies on the reader to understand what’s not being said. Take your time to read this one and cherish it. Award-winning books and stories make me wary, but this is an exception. I felt for the girl and the Kinsellas. I wanted them to have a happy ever after. The ending is bittersweet and suits the story. But I wanted more. I understand why the author ended it at that point, but I needed more from this book. The ending is a bit vague, so if you are like me, check out this blog on Julian Girdham’s website . It’ll make you feel better. To sum up, Foster is a beautiful and bittersweet story about life and human choices. It’s a short read but will stay with you for a long time.

Никоя от нас двете не говори, както се случва да правят хората, когато са щастливи - но щом тази мисъл ми минава през ума, си давам сметка, че и обратното е вярно. Където има тайни, има и срам. А срамът е нещо, което можем да си спестим. Ръцете й са като на майка ми, но в тях има и нещо друго, нещо, което досега не съм усещала и което не мога да назова.

Част от мен иска баща ми да ме остави тук, докато друга част иска той да ме върне към познатите неща. Намирам се на място, където нито мога да бъда това, което винаги съм, нито да се превърна в онова, което бих могла да бъда. Свикнала с тези неща, с този начин на мъжете да не водят същински разговор - те обичат да изровят с петата на ботуша някой чим трева, да удрят с длан по тавана на колата, преди тя да тръгне, да плюят, да седят широко разкрачени, сякаш изобщо не ги е грижа.

""Can you see it?"" he says. "" ""I can,"" I say. ""It's there."" And that is when he puts his arms around me and gathers me into them as though I were his own. Told from the perspective of a young girl, left in the home of strangers by an overwhelmed family. A summer that germinates greater awareness of the differences between people, between parenting styles, between existing and living, between indifference and love, between surviving and thriving. Bittersweet story well worth reading. Addendum...watched The Quiet Girl last night and did not know until I turned it on it is the movie rendition of this book. Well done and sweetly touching.

It is a study in contrasts where one household, one family is found wanting in every way and the other is full of everything good and loving. It is the difference between a child being seen as a burden versus a gift to be cherished. Keegan has given us a beautiful story of poverty and indifference, heartbreaking loss and shining love, not spoken aloud but shown in a hundred small ways. It is a story where a young, introverted girl thrives and matures in her found family and, as a result, she will always see the world through this new lens. It is the love that will stay with me and though it ends as it must, I can't help but imagine the story into the future.

What was it about? A child who was never loved felt strangely sad yet hesitantly happy at this new feeling of being loved at another place. You find yourself swept away by the simplistic descriptions of the Irish landscapes, the narrative of a girl who feels unwanted at her home, only to find herself belonging in a place she desperately wanted to call home.""You don’t ever have to say anything,"" he says. ‘Always remember that as a thing you need never do.

It’s a hard feeling but as we walk along I begin to settle and let the difference between my life at home and the one I have here be. He takes shorter steps so we can walk in time. I think about the woman in the cottage, of how she walked and spoke, and conclude that there are huge differences between people.”Foster is an extended short story by award-winning Irish author, Claire Keegan. When her mother is heavily pregnant with her fifth child, a young girl is deposited with John and Edna Kinsellla, a couple on a Wexford farm, people from her mother’s family. How long she will stay is unsure, and she has no expectation about her reception there. The care and attention given her by these strangers ought not be unfamiliar to her, but she initially struggles to trust the genuineness of the approval, encouragement and warm praise she receives. Criticism is what she's up used to from her parents, proud but poor folk struggling to make ends meet, her father a little too fond of a smoke, a drink and a wager; “With my mother it is all work: us, the buttermaking, the dinners, the washing up and getting up and getting ready for Mass and school, weaning calves and hiring men to plough and harrow the fields, stretching the money and setting the alarm.”With Edna Kinsella: “Her hands are like my mother’s hands but there is something else in them too, something I have never felt before and have no name for. I feel at such a loss for words but this is a new place, and new words are needed.”The girl is happy to help with chores around the house and farm and enjoys the spirit of cooperation the couple has; any mistakes or missteps are excused without fuss. It's later that a gossipy neighbour reveals some thing about the couple that helps her understand her position with them. Shown kindness and love, it’s little wonder she’s sad to leave them at the end of summer.Keegan’s descriptive prose is often gorgeous: ” There’s a big moon shining on the yard, chalking our way onto the lane and along the road” and “The wind is high and hoarse in the trees, tearing fretfully through the dry boughs, and their leaves rise and swing.” Her spare prose succinctly evokes setting, situation and mood. it is no surprise this story is a prize winner.This unbiased review is from an uncorrected proof copy provided by NetGalley and Grove Atlantic."
183,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134833559-mark-bailey,Rating 5 out of 5,"More or less a carry on from my last review - here I am again mesmerised by another Claire Keegan book. This time it's 'Foster', published a decade before the phenomenal 'Small Things Like These', and once more lapped up in a frenzied couple of days. While both of the aforementioned are short in length, it by no means compromises the quality. And as Keegan quite aptly remarked in an interview: 'something needs to be as long as it needs to be'.  Foster is the story of a child as she is taken by her father to live with relatives on a farm. It isn't clear when, or if, she will ever return. The relatives are the Kinsellas, and the warmth and comfort they show the child is clearly lacking from her immediate family. As a result, it is the Kinsella's who permit her to blossom as she navigates new spaces and ways of living. Ways of living that are disparate at home: intentional, rewarding of basic attention and affection, assuaged by the Kinsella's tenderness. Ultimately, the family afford the child something so simple, yet so often criminally overlooked: time. Moreover, Keegan gracefully states in relation to writing itself: 'fiction is temporal art', based on time that is 'irreversibly passing in one direction'. Everybody is aware of what 'a day' is, hence making reading so universal and pleasurable. Yet eventually a day will come for us all that we won't see the end of - 'and that piece of time between now and then is called our lives'. In Foster, due to tragic experiences earlier in their lives, the Kinsella's understand time and its fleeting nature more than anybody else... Another absolutely stunning Irish novella from a writer who puts a lot of things into perspective."

This kinda caught me off guard because in the narration she sounded very mature and it felt like she was a 20 years old woman recounting her childhood story but she used present tense so that wasn't the case, then in her conversation she sounds just like a child. It was a bit confusing too because a lot of things such as identities and time were blur in this, like we don't know what year they are living, what's the mc age, how long was the timespan in this story... so yeah- it's not giving me anything.But I do enjoyed this and finished it but only because I was just too curious to find out where this is going.

“You don’t ever have to say anything,’ he says. ‘Always remember that as a thing you need never do. Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.”
I had heard of this novella before, but it was not until I got the chance to watch the masterful adaptation by Colm Bairéad that I got determined to read it. A brilliant movie, if I may add it here. Recommendable to everyone.It is not fair to compare two mediums, but some comparison gets registered in your brain once you experience the same material in both mediums. Nevertheless, it is confounding how much power such a simple storyline can evoke. The storytelling is also very mature. Usually, a story as emotionally resonant as this one endangers itself on the verge of becoming melodramatic. But not here. The narrative is Hemingway-simple, keeping in mind how the brain of a socially awkward youth works and how several complicated emotions start to get formed but never get consolidated enough to present themselves to the outer world.
“It’s a hard feeling but as we walk along I begin to settle and let the difference between my life at home and the one I have here be.”
One thing that can get slightly jarring is that our protagonist's narrative doesn't always feel like that of a very young person. It matches the maturity level an adolescent mind can achieve, but as the story remains very vague concerning the particulars, I was confused a few times at the start of the novella, I won't lie. The adaptation manages to play it off better, in my opinion. I have always felt this, but it works better for me when the turmoil of emotions inside an introverted youth is expressed only through a performer's eyes (or body language). Whereas introspective prose, like this one, tries to be more articulate about those feelings. That slightly downplays the emotional devastation that is supposed to hit us at the end of the story. I mean, I teared up at the end of the movie. Didn't work so much when I was reading the story.
“This water is cool and clean as anything I have ever tasted; it tastes of my father leaving, of him never having been there, of having nothing after he was gone.”
Again, I don't think that is the author's inefficiency. Maybe it is just the incapability of the literary medium or just a preference? Either way, a brilliant read whatsoever."

Catherine Clinch is the young girl. I have not seen the movie but intend to do so. I am becoming a fan of Claire Keegan. This work, like the others I have read, is spare, gentle, quiet - yet covers so many emotions. I found myself thinking about it over and over after I finished it. A young girl, not understanding what is happening, is taken to relatives to live since her mother is very pregnant and has many other children (we never learn how many). Frankly, she is just dumped on them, no explanation - she is a bit frightened at first. She has no other clothes, shoes, toothbrush, comb, brush - nothing personal and mostly needed, The couple treat her gently, help her, get clothes (new and used) for her, teach her -- all the things parents should do but her own parents are too busy and too lazy to teach her or help her. The gentleness of the couple is wonderful - they are quiet, clean, orderly, helping, not demanding - the child is amazed and begins to trust them. Then she gets some maturity and understanding. I wanted the book to go on forever. It is a short book but packed with emotions and teachings for us all. The ending was painful for me but still teaching a lesson. This short gentle book would be wonderful for a book discussion club."

Clearly, as demonstrated by one of my rare 5 star ratings, this did not disappoint. Keegan writes elegantly about Ireland and the people, sometimes earthy, sometimes sad ,but always capturing humor and also the vivid intoxicating natural world there.This tiny novel has much to tell in its pages. Apparently it first appeared in the  New Yorker , but it was published in a revised and expanded form. This is a lovely, sad, yet sweet tale of a little girl whose family was with limited means. She spends a summer with a kind and loving couple on their farm. It was easy to envision life there, perhaps somewhat ordinary, but always filled with glorious discoveries. I will not reveal spoilers here because I wish others would feel the pleasure I had while reading. I truly wanted more!Some examples of Keegan's messages in this book:On Nature-  The wind is high and hoarse in the trees, tearing fretfully through the dry boughs, when their leaves rise and swing. It's sweet to feel the open road falling away under us, knowing we will, at its end, come to the sea. The road goes on and the sky, everything, seems to get brighter.

Her latest novel Small Things Like These explored the Magdalene laundries through the eyes of a person who lives a comfortable life, thus mixing a topical subject with social class. 2010’s Foster is only 88 pages but there is a lot going on.The plot is deceptively simple: a neglected girl is sent to distant relatives who are husband and wife as her mother is having a baby and her father is not really capable of looking after her. Through various episodes, the girl discovers that life with the relatives is better and that showing care changes her. the backdrop is the TroublesHowever there is one scene where she asks the wife whether she keeps secrets to which she says that she never does.As the book progresses we discover that now and then we all keep secrets.Told beautifully, with a lot of heart, I’m amazed at how Claire Keegan manages to create such well rounded characters in a small space of time.

197,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2103966-canadianreader-not-receiving-all-notifications,Rating 3 out of 5,"I’ve no complaints about Keegan’s sensitive writing, but I found this novella underwhelming. I’m afraid I was unable to read it free from the memory of the first, very dark, narrative in Keegan’s collection, Walk the Blue Fields. That story, “The Parting Gift,” features a young girl on the cusp of womanhood fleeing a highly dysfunctional family, her father a brute and her mother enraged at having been pregnant for the greater part of a bitter and disastrous marriage. One child after another—until a “solution” had been found. It was to offer up her pre-pubescent daughter, the main character in the story, to the girl’s father to be used sexually by him for some years so that the mother would not have to endure sex and further pregnancies. . Rather than be struck by the fineness of Keegan’s prose or taken by her powers of observation, I wanted the author to simply allow the little girl in Foster to be rescued by the couple, John and Edna—relatives who’d lovingly cared for her over the summer while girl’s mother awaited the birth of yet another child. The fact that, once brought home, the girl runs after the departing couple, evidently fearful and fleeing her father, said it all for me. It would, of course, have been something of a fairytale ending for the child to be given a chance to escape the shame that overshadows her life, a shame that’s frequently mentioned in the novella, though its source is never explicitly stated. True as the ending of Foster might read, I wanted it to be otherwise."

Some quiet sobbing ensued at the very touching conclusion.A couple of quotes:“‘You don’t ever have to say anything,’ he says. ‘Always remember that as a thing you need never do. Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.” “There's a big moon shining on the yard, chalking our way onto the lane and along the road.

It's interesting how closely the film follows the book, and how the two versions speak to one another: An Cailín Ciúin is richer, more imagistic, and perhaps less subtle, but both are beautiful pieces of work that compliment one another. A subtle, moving novella about an unnamed girl who lives with her mother's sister while her mother has another baby. The strength of the book lies in its evocation both of place and what it feels to be a child: uncertain, vulnerable to the whims of adults, and strongly aware of the outside world. The details of the dusty summer, the small Wexford farm, cooking and cleaning, are all perfectly evoked, and the allow the reader to inhabit the narrative. The emotions beneath the surface come to the reader slowly, as the child begins to understand what's going on. It's flawless piece of writing, compelling and spare."

210,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/158205373-paulo---listening-days-of-future-passed-by-the-moody-blues,No Rating,"I have great difficulty finding the right adjectives, in terms of quantity and especially quality, to clearly express what I think about Claire Keegan's works.She is certainly one of the greatest modern writers who use the short story form to achieve a magnificent impact on the reader's heart and mind.Her work is influenced, according to her, by the writing of Frank O'Connor and also by another O'Connor, Mary Flannery, whose Gothic tales she read during her stay in New Orleans and her studies at Loyola University.This is a social realism novel, written in the present continuous tense by an omniscient first-person narrator.In certain respects, this story has all the classic elements of a Bildungsroman (""education novel"" or ""education novel"" that portrays and explores how the protagonist develops morally and psychologically). In its classic form, it involves a young, uneducated person forced by circumstances to face the harsh realities of life sooner than normally expected, but I'm not sure that can fully apply here.All past events are narrated by an unnamed little girl, aged seven or eight (her real age is never mentioned), in a fast-moving photo-type story. The whole plot revolves around the dilemmas in which the narrator finds herself with her loyalties divided between a known hard life, to which she owes her allegiance and a new, unknown but seductive reality with temporary but kind and loving adoptive parents. Keegan wonderfully captures and conveys just how difficult subsequent guilt of conscience can be for a child this age.One of the things Keegan pulls off with stunning accuracy here is how heartbreaking never known before love and tenderness can be because it emphasizes and reveals what's missing. Claire Keegan's keen sense of empathy, attention to detail, and deep understanding of the moral issues raised by meanness and suffering lead the readers to look outside of themselves and beyond their little world in their navel. Keegan has a perceptive ear for worldly evil, but she attunes even better and more clearly to goodness and its complexities.Only the ""muggles"" of this world have a ready answer to all the moral questions this brilliant story raises, mainly in the undercurrent created in our subconscious because of what is not said and also because of what is not fully understood by the main character.More than most books five times the size, Foster delivers everything we ask of great literature: it expands our world and opens our souls and minds. This is a small book with an outsized universal impact.Since its publication in 2010, Foster has been part of the school curriculum in Ireland.Keegan's creation is rare and her stories are as sparse as they are impactful because they are sculpted long and delicately until they are distilled to an essential purity that cannot be ignored only digested and savoured slowly. If she published something that isn't perfect, I haven't read it yet."
211,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65597491-shannon-m-trying-to-get-all-my-reviews-written,Rating 5 out of 5,"FOSTER is a novella that is poignant, spellbinding, provocative, and impressive but it is not entertainment. I am glad that I read it but wouldn’t want to immerse myself in another similar narrative. It captivates by showing the world through the eyes of a young girl being temporarily fostered at the home of a relative while her mother waits to give birth. We are never told the girl’s name or her age, but my guess is that she is around ten.At her own home, her mother is loving but has little time to devote to the girl or her siblings. With my mother it is all work: us, the butter-making, the dinners, the washing up and getting up and getting ready for Mass and school, weaning calves and hiring men to plough and harvest the fields, stretching the money and setting the alarm.The girls father, on the other hand, is a ne’er-do-well, a lazy, unproductive loser, whose buffoonery is obvious even to his young daughter. I wonder why my father lies about the hay. He is given to lying about things that would be nice, if they were true.At the farm where she is fostered, she slowly uncovers truths about emotions and love and sadness, and life in a more normal world, one where men work, women gossip, and there’s enough money for small treats; a world where tragedy is endured with tolerance. And she forms a relationship with a man who she wishes were her father.Eventually she returns to her real family; its miserly, sparse environment has not changed. She wishes she had remained a “foster”. The ending is somewhat ambiguous, but while reading it, I assumed it was a wish-fulfillment dream, and not reality.A deep-felt story told in simple words. Philosophical in tone. Throughout most of it, the young girl’s voice is authentic. Although she sometimes verbalizes thoughts beyond her years, these are repetitions of comments made by the adults surrounding her. I found only one sentence off-putting because it expressed wisdom beyond her age. This occurred early in the story, when her father is leaving her with the relatives, and is not a repetition of what an adult says: I am in a spot where I can neither be what I always am nor turn into what I could be. This is not a child thinking; it is the author describing the child’s situation. Otherwise it is near perfect.Recommended for when you want to read a sad literary tale. It’s short, and so can easily be read in one sitting.I borrowed this book from the Greater Victoria Public Library."
212,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2497735-brenda-cregor,Rating 5 out of 5,"*SPOILER ALERT*This story is simple.Simple language.Simple characters.Simple plot.No graphic horrors.The genius of this short story [ and, though it is in ""book form"", that is what it is] lies with its surprise ending.I was surprised I did not want the girl to return to her parents.Why?There were no clues that she had been abused or neglected [beyond the ""neglect"" that comes to any child in a large family] by her biological parents.It is true her family was very poor, but there is no particularevil that comes to a child from growing up temporallyimpoverished---unless there is filth and laziness, and shedid not seem to be lazy. Sure she was a bit grungy, but that comes with the territory of childhood in a rural area.What it came down to was that I felt this girl was notcherished by her own parents.I am sure they did their best, under the circumstances of their life,but even their own young flesh and blood understood, after a shorttime with the precious saintly Kinsellas, the difference of between beingsomeone's ""ward"" and being someone's ""child"".While reading this story, I remembered family goes beyond the bonds of genes, blood,and/or matrimony. Our family consists of those who choose to cherish and nourish us: temporally, emotionally, and spiritually.We should make it an important quest in our life to choose our ""family"" carefully, as they will bethe genesis of many of our joys and sorrows.Children are ""stuck"", sometimes real victims, of their family-realities, unless there is outside intervention, if they are in danger. This is sometimes their greatest life tragedy. As adults, we can choose our family-connections. We should take advantage of this and become victors of our relational destiny.The stark contrast between the child's parents and the Kinsellas, even with the limited exposure theauthor gave the reader, as to details, made the ending a tragic one.The ""present tense"" in-the-moment first person narration made the telling more intense."

It's not yet at my local library but this novella was and I wanted to sample her writing. So glad I did. She's a masterful writer. The sun's at a slant now, throws a rippled version of how we look back at us. For a moment, I'm afraid. I wait until I see myself not as I was when I arrived, looking like a tinker's child, but as I am now, clean, in different clothes, with the woman behind me. A slightly ominous tale, you feel like the young narrator's life is in the balance, either in her parent's hands or in her foster parent's hands. The writing quickly drew me in, to the point I was quickly enthralled and had an emotional connection by the end. Really impressive when it's only 88 pages long. My only problem now is do I wait for her booker nominee to turn up at the library or do I add it to my own shelves. Decisions, decisions."
215,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76115822-buchbesessen,Rating 5 out of 5,"In ""Das dritte Licht"" geht es um das Thema Familie.Die Protagonistin und Ich-Erzählerin, ein namenloses Mädchen, ich schätze es auf etwa sieben, wird zu ihr unbekannten Verwandten gebracht. Ihre Mutter ist wieder schwanger, ihr Vater, der trinkt und spielt, lädt sie ab - sie soll so lange bleiben, wie Edna und John es wollen.Bei den Kinsellas ist alles anders: Sie ist nicht nur geduldet, nicht eine von vielen. Sie ist willkommen, wird angenommen und gefördert. Ihr wird vor Augen geführt, was ihr bisher fehlte - eine schmerzliche Erfahrung.Zunächst steht Edna im Vordergrund, von der Hauptfigur vorwiegend als ""Die Frau"" bezeichnet. Sie kann sich nicht auf eine Weise auf sie einlassen, wie ihr Ehemann es vermag. John behandelt die Kleine wie sein eigenes Kind, will sie weder auf Abstand halten noch ersetzen. Sie spürt das - und die Geschichte läuft auf ein Ende hinaus, das ergreifend und umwerfend ist.Ich liebe den Schreibstil der Autorin.

Small Things Like These is a beautiful book, slender but exquisitely written.Foster is going on my ""Favorites"" shelf: gorgeously written, simple, tender, and deeply moving. It is the story of a little girl who is dropped off by her father to stay with relatives. The child doesn't know when--or if--her father is coming back for her. Although I read it in less than two hours, I felt deeply impacted. I borrowed it from the library but I'm considering buying a copy so I can reread it. Also, I want to support this enormously gifted writer, in exchange for the gifts she has given (and hopefully will continue to give) us through her writing. "

But the summer must come to an end.This is a perfect, quiet little story, about the small moments that can mean so much. It is the kind of book that makes you consider the impact of the kindnesses you've been shown throughout life and the gratitude you wish you'd expressed more of. Above all, it feels like a thank-you to the wise and kind, the understanding and encouraging. I sobbed through the last page of this, what a wonderfully perfect little story."

233,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4406720-baz,Rating 4 out of 5,"Another work of potent beauty and depth by Keegan, one of my favourite author discoveries of 2022.I note down and collect things I read that writers and artistic minds say about what literary fiction is. Or anything that speaks to me about my favourite styles of writing, or kinds of fiction. Knowing how hard it is to talk about, describe or articulate what great art is, or how it’s achieved and what its effects are, I figured a while back that a stash of quotes that I can go back to, and add to, reread and think about, would be super handy. And it is.All that to say that I added two more quotes, both from praise for Foster and Keegan, which beautifully captures the great art of her writing, and what gives me immense pleasure:1. ‘A masterly combination of things pregnant and poised, frozen and in flux.’2. ‘She creates luminous effects with spare material, so every line seems to be a lesson in the perfect deployment of both style and emotion.’ This one from Hilary Mantel.There’s a simplicity in both Foster and Small Things Like These that feels like wisdom. A simplicity that is the end product of a brilliant mind that has compassion, integrity and exacting artistic standards.There’s a line in the book where the young narrator says: ‘I think about the woman in the cottage, of how she walked and spoke, and conclude that there are huge differences between people.’A small realization, epiphany, like this, so simple and straightforward, feels incredibly powerful. When you can do that as a writer, say there are huge differences between people, and for it to be devastating: that is miraculous. That is real art."

Seeing through her eyes, we as readers don't have a full picture of what's going on in all their lives outside of this small vignette, and as the girl starts to piece things together so do we.It felt like every single word was crafted with precision with layers of meaning and with something to foreshadow. The wallpaper with the little boys on it, the well, the horses at sea -- every word had a purpose, even if it was a subtle one. The prose was soft and smooth like silk. I loved the Irish brogue in the dialogue, too.It was short, and ended with a bit of ambiguity. I can imagine that with more pages, Claire Keegan could have gone deeper into the story -- but that would have defeated the point. It was a vignette of one summer, of a little girl gaining a better understanding of the world around her, of seeing another way to live without secrets or shame. We don't see what came before this summer or what will come after, we can only hope that things will work out for her. This was a five star read for me, and one that pairs so well with Small Things Like These."

She is naturally curious, imagining different versions of what the Kinsellas may be like, while we realise in the course of that drive and their arrival at the Kinsellas’ farm that our narrator’s father is far from ideal, gambling away their cow, not even caring to say goodbye when he drops the little girl or when or whether he will return for her. Her mother (overworked and with the responsibility of the farm and large family on her hands) may have braided her hair and dressed her as best as she could but by the time they arrive at the Kinsellas, she’s a wild child, hair all loose. But while she may be apprehensive, almost from the moment they arrive, she feels something she has never experienced before, in the welcoming kiss from Mrs Kinsella, like her mother but yet notshe is even taller than my mother with the same black hair but hers is cut tight like a helmet. She’s wearing a printed blouse and brown, flared trousers.in the homely smells—baking, disinfectant and bleach—likely very different from her own home, a nice meal, a cat around, leaving our narrator confusedI am in a spot where I can neither be what I always am not turn into what I could be.From her very first bath in the Kinsellas’ home with the ample warm water she has never had, to Mrs Kinsella’s motherly touch and her soon being woven in to the Kinsellas daily lives and chores—that go on seemingly without rush, yet are always moving—she finds the warmth and ‘love’ (though she may not name it that) that is the true meaning of home and family. But of course, this arrangement isn’t meant to be permanent, the time to go home will come. What then?This is such a lovely lovely story with as much unsaid as said, and so perfectly told in through the little girl—perfect in that she can convey what she sees and feels even if she can’t quite name it, My heart does not so much feel that it is in my chest as in my hands and I am carrying it along swiftly as though I have become the messenger for what is going on inside me.and the reader feels that range of emotions with her from confusion to warmth and love, from sympathy to heart-break (even some humour when on a shopping trip with the Kinsellas, she describes Mrs K as asking for ‘Aunt Acid’ at the chemist’s, something I couldn’t stop laughing over), all with little said, more expressed in small actions and touches. Though this is essentially the story of these characters and the bonds that exist or form, one also gets a broader sense of the time and place as well.The ending seems to be heading in the inevitable direction, yet it doesn’t quite as Keegan leaves it ambiguous, for us to understand as we will. A truly wonderful, emotional reading experience."
248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler,Rating 3 out of 5,"This is a story of a young girl experiencing a loving and caring home environment for the first time. The book's narrative raises feelings of tenderness in the heart of the reader without using words that explicitly ask for such feelings. In other words, the author didn't waste any words but simply tells a simple story in the first person voice of a girl from a crowded and poor family who has been temporarily farmed out to another couple for several summer months. Her temporary foster parents are very kind and patient with her. One of the things that the story reveals is that a son from this foster family has recently died. Perhaps the young girl has been loaned to them to fill the emotional void created by the lost son. When the end of the summer arrives she is taken back to her biological family. The reunion with family and siblings is emotionally chilly. Her mother has given birth to another baby while she's been gone. She runs and hugs her foster parents while they are leaving, and the story ends there.The reader can imagine the story continuing from that point in any way desired."

Η Claire Keegan έχει ένα μαγικό τρόπο να μεταφέρει πάμπολλα συναισθήματα, αλήθειες και καταστάσεις μέσα από τα πολύ μικρά σε έκταση αλλά τεράστια σε σημασία και νοήματα βιβλία της. Μετά το «Μικρά Πράγματα σαν κι αυτά» με το οποίο τη γνωρίσαμε στην Ελλάδα, έρχεται να μας χτυπήσει και πάλι εκεί που πονάει με την εξαιρετική νουβέλα «Τα τρία φώτα».Πόσο καιρό να την κρατήσουν;Δεν μπορούν να την κρατήσουν όσο θέλουν;Αυτό θα τους πω; ρώτησε ο πατέρας μου.Πες ό,τι θες. Πάντα αυτό κάνεις άλλωστε.Ιρλανδική επαρχία, αρκετά χρόνια πριν. Το καλοκαίρι είναι σε πλήρη εξέλιξη. Ζέστη και ξηρασία τρώνε τη γη. Ο κόσμος πεινάει. Πολλές οικογένειες δυσκολεύονται να τα βγάλουν πέρα, ιδιαίτερα οι πολυμελείς. Σε μια τέτοια ανήκει και το κορίτσι που πρωταγωνιστεί στην ιστορία μας. Για την ακρίβεια, η οικογένειά της ετοιμάζεται να δεχτεί ένα νέο μέλος και οι γονείς δυσκολεύονται όχι μόνο να τα βγάλουν πέρα οικονομικά, αλλά και με τόσα παιδιά. Αποφασίζουν λοιπόν να αποχωριστούν για λίγο ένα από τα κορίτσια τους και το πηγαίνουν να ζήσει με κάποιους συγγενείς για το καλοκαίρι. Το κορίτσι δεν ξέρει πόσο θα κρατήσει η διαμονή της εκεί. Φαντάζεται ότι είναι μόνο για το καλοκαίρι και στην αρχή ελπίζει αυτό να τελειώσει γρήγορα. Δεν γνωρίζει αυτούς τους ανθρώπους και ο πατέρας της βιάστηκε να φύγει μόλις την άφησε. Ούτε μια αγκαλιά δεν της έκανε για να τη χαιρετίσει, ενώ από την πρεμούρα του να εξαφανιστεί, πήρε μαζί του και τα λιγοστά της πράγματα που είχαν ετοιμάσει με τη μητέρα.Σύντομα το κορίτσι μαθαίνει στην ήρεμη και ήσυχη ζωή των Κινσέλα, την τόσο διαφορετική από τη ζωή της στο σπίτι. Κοντά τους θα βρει όλα όσα της λείπουν στην οικογένειά της. Στοργή, ζεστασιά, προσοχή, χρόνο για τον εαυτό της και ποιοτικό χρόνο με άλλους. Μαθαίνει τον κόσμο. Να κάνει λάθη και να μαθαίνει από αυτά. Να δοκιμάζει και να σκέφτεται. Μα και να αισθάνεται. Και στο σπίτι αυτό αισθάνεται συναισθήματα που δεν είχε ξαναδοκιμάσει. Αισθάνεται σαν να βρίσκεται σπίτι. Μπορεί οι Κινσέλα να μην είναι οι γονείς της, όμως της δίνουν περισσότερα από όσα της είχαν δώσει ποτέ οι βιολογικοί της γονείς. Κι αυτό είναι που μετράει τελικά για το κορίτσι.Μια συγκινητική ιστορία, για το πως τα παιδιά πρέπει να μεγαλώνουν σαν παιδιά. Να αισθάνονται ότι τα αγαπούν, τα φροντίζουν, ότι νοιάζονται γι’ αυτά. Να αισθάνονται ασφάλεια μέσα στις φτερούγες της οικογένειας. Να ξέρουν ότι έχουν σε κάποιον να βασιστούν, όχι μόνο για να τους στηρίξει σε κάποια δυσκολία ή να τους βγάλει από μια δύσκολη θέση, αλλά και για να τους προσφέρει ηθική και ψυχολογική στήριξη, να τους μάθει πως θα γίνουν άνθρωποι αλλά και πως θα παραμείνουν παιδιά. Να ξέρουν ότι έχουν κάποιον δίπλα τους για να μιλήσουν, να γελάσουν, να εμπιστευτούν.«Αν ήσουν δικό μου, δεν θα σε άφηνα ποτέ σε ένα σπίτι ξένων».Η Claire Keegan με τη μοναδική φωνή της, μας φέρνει την Ιρλανδία του παρελθόντος πιο κοντά, αναγκάζοντάς μας να τη συγκρίνουμε με τα δικά μας βιώματα του παρελθόντος, με όσα ζήσαμε, ακούσαμε, είδαμε ή διαβάσαμε και θέλουμε να ελπίζουμε ότι όλα αυτά ανήκουν στο παρελθόν και πως είμαστε πια άνθρωποι… Κι ακόμη πως όλες οι σχέσεις χτίζονται με προσπάθεια και από τις δύο μεριές, δεν εκβιάζονται, όπως ακριβώς η σχέση του κοριτσιού με τον Κινσέλα, ��ναν άνθρωπο που νιώθει πιο κοντά κι από πατέρα της.Το βιβλίο έχει μεταφερθεί στον κινηματογράφο με τον τίτλο «Το ήσυχο κορίτσι» και ήταν υποψήφια για Όσκαρ ξενόγλωσσης ταινίας. "

251,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/402584-teresa,Rating 5 out of 5,"Wow! What an absolutely beautiful, scintillating gem of a book – 96 pages of pure perfection. If I was to recommend a book to all of my friends, both avid and reluctant readers, it would be this, described as a “long, short story” rather than a novella.Winner of the Davy Byrnes Irish Writing Award in 2009, Claire Keegan has excelled herself here, in a long story which was originally published in a shorter form, in The New Yorker. Without giving away too much of the plot, our narrator, an unnamed young girl, is taken by her father to a farm in Wexford to be “fostered” out to the Kinsellas for the summer months while her mother gets ready for the birth of yet another child. The impression given is that the girl comes from a near-impoverished background with a father who is a loafer and a mother who strives to keep their heads above water. Therefore, she is thrown into a totally alien environment amongst strangers – yes, its rural, farm setting is similar to her own home but there the similarities end.Foster is too short to be a coming of age story but it is certainly a “coming of awareness” story in that our narrator’s view of the world is vastly expanded in the space of one hot summer, and we don’t have many of those in Ireland, I can tell you! I loved the fact that it’s not a sterotypically Irish tale of woe and misery – of course, alcohol does feature but in the context of a wake at which it is the norm to toast the deceased. Instead it’s a timeless tale of rural Irish life in which the bleatings of the outside world are somewhat muffled. Indeed, apart from a passing reference to the death of one of the strikers (the H Block Hunger Strike in the early 80s), you would think you were in a bygone era.The writing is exquisite, so simple, yet carrying such underlying emotion and meaning. I stand in awe of a writer who can capture the essence of rural Ireland and the story of a young girl’s engagement with the world in so few words. Small is indeed beautiful and I wholeheartedly recommend this story to all readers."

Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.”The story of a young child in an Irish village sent to live with distant relatives while her mother is pregnant. So simple, nothing happens at all and therein lies its beauty. Foster celebrates silence, the most misunderstood quality. Personally, I have been the 'quiet girl' all my life which has often been mistaken for 'lack of a life', rudeness, and arrogance. Then I accidentally landed in a corporate field wherein I fake talkativeness for 12 hours a day. Lots of loud chatter, words and words and more of them, mistaken as meaningful when they are anything but that. Keegan prefers to say more with the absence of words than some contemporary authors are able to say with 500 pages of meaningless nothing. And in this silence, there is so much emotional power, such tenderness, wisdom and humanity. The writing invites you to listen to these silences and make your interpretations, think through each scene where seemingly nothing happens but an incredible amount does. Foster hits you in the gut just when it's making you complacent."

Tuttavia speriamo che la luminosa esperienza di amore genitoriale, anche se è durata l’intervallo di una sola estate, possa mettere radici durature nel cuore di una fanciulla.“Benedetta bambina.

The young girl at the time has no idea if she'll go back to her family and doesn't know much about the couple who has taken her in.While there, the young girl learns about true love, kindness and what caring feels like and grows to really love the couple as they buy her things, make her feel at home and care for her in all the ways that a young child needs and wants.The whole story was just bursting with emotion and feeling on each page and definitely didn't feel only 80 something pages.

Mas quis começar por ""Foster"" por a premissa ter captado á minha atenção, uma adolescente irá passar um verão na casa dos tios enquanto sua mãe encontra-se grávida. Os primeiros capítulos demonstraram serem muito promissores, demonstrando o carinho que a tia oferece á esta sobrinha que sofre com a falta de tempo dos pais para lhe dar atenção. Mas depois da descoberta do segredo a história torna-se um pouco previsível, e o final achei demasiado dramático para o meu gosto. Apesar de não ter sido uma leitura marcante é um livro que aconselho a sua leitura, pois nos leva a refletir sobre as relações entre pais e filhos.

The depiction of that couple’s relationship and of their caring for the girl is masterfully and profoundly done. If I must quibble, there are a couple of plot points that feel a bit forced, but these are easily overlooked because of the richness and depth found everywhere else.The story’s structure at times reminded me of both the song “Ode to Billy Joe” and of the short story/play Trifles/”A Jury of Her Peers”, since, as with those, the lives of the characters are often revealed by small details and conversations that blend daily mundanities with hints of things more profound.The first-person narration mostly works, though (and maybe this is just a problem I have these days) the narrative voice that is supposed to be a young girl’s is a bit uneven — sometimes feeling wise, sometimes ignorant; sometimes like the girl’s, sometimes like that of the grown woman writing the book.I read Keegan’s later work Small Things Like These for my book club a while back; the characters and tone of this story are very similar, and, as with that one, ""Foster"" seems more like a short story than a novel, but what a lovely, poignant, deftly-crafted story it is."

Der Originaltitel dieser Erzählung lautet „Foster“. „To foster a child“ kann sowohl „ein Kind in Pflege geben“, als auch „ein Kind in Pflege nehmen“ heißen, und beides geschieht in dieser Erzählung von Claire Keegan, beide Seiten werden beleuchtet, viele Dinge nur angedeutet, aber nicht ausgesprochen oder auserzählt und das ist auch die grosse Qualität dieses relativ kurzen Textes.Es sind die Geheimnisse, die unausgesprochenen Dinge, die diese wunderbaren knapp hundert Seiten lange Erzählung dominieren und mich als Leser beschäftigen. Es ist diese einfache und alles durchdringende Sprache und in gewisser Art und Weise auch dieses haften bleibende unbefriedigende Gefühl, das am Ende eben genau diesen Nachgeschmack hinterlässt. „Das dritte Licht“ ist sehr ambivalent, hat etwas raues und ursprüngliches und ist doch voller Poesie und wunderschöner Einfachheit. Die Erzählung wurde unter dem Titel „The Quiet Girl“ verfilmt und erhielt die erste Oscar-Nominierung Irlands als bester internationaler Film."

The girl’s parents, vexed life and poverty, limit their capacity to care for her and her siblings, with her mother Mary heavily pregnant again. It’s with precise insight, our young protagonist navigates her way through a somewhat bleak adult world, gently observing the differences with discerning emotional depth. “With my mother it is all work: us, the butter-making, the dinners, the washing up and getting up and getting ready for Mass and school, weaning calves, and hiring men to plough and harrow the fields, stretching the money and setting the alarm. But this is a different type of house. Here there is room, and time to think. There may even be money to spare.”The language, the prose … it’s mysterious, quiet and unassuming …yet it’s loud and rumbling, it’s unsettling and shimmies right to your heart. A true example of size doesn’t matter - can I say this? - it may be a small story but it’s core essence is huge, it effortlessly illuminates the depth of the human spirit, love and above all kindness.

So I read the whole book. Turns out, she had one question about the ending of the book that was very clearly answered by the book itself. Her question was about the plot. It's like her asking, Do you think she did it? about Where the Crawdads Sing. I was like huh???It's just a small book about a little girl who is sent to live with an older, childless couple that absolutely leaves you a little heartbroken. Everything that happens is exactly what you'd expect but is still very affecting, credit to the author. Really warms your heart and I got all emotional over children, and parenthood, and caring about other individuals, and tight-knit communities—not bad for a book under 100 pages.

I began to wonder how many children are in the house altogther, why did they send her with nothing only the clothes on her back. You begin to move to the foster parents and many questions leap at you from the page as to the reaction the mother has when the father wants to go to Gorey and how everyone will ask questions about the little girl.The ending is so beautiful that you can't help but feel sorry for her own family and yet so much happiness for the little girl and her foster parents.It was very bleak and dark in places yet the caring and loving can through in glimpses that you could feel.A definite re-read as you should read it slow and take in everything and question everthing the book does NOT do or say."

There, she experiences love and tenderness for what appears to be the first time in her short life.

286,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127645342-emma,Rating 4 out of 5,"Foster is a short story that reminds you that simplicity in literature produces remarkable results. Set in rural Ireland, we follow a young girl who is taken to live with distant relatives with no set time frame as to how long she will be there or when she will return home. Away, she discovers the love and fulfilment that her familial home lacks due to a lack of money and alcoholism but there is a secret she will discover that threatens the warmth of her foster parents’ home. Quite simply exceptional. Claire Keegan will extract more emotion from you than you thought possible in such a short book. The prose is beautiful - raw in the way it shapes the two differing environments you get to know and emotional in the way you watch the innocence of childhood form in a girl who knew way too much at such a young age due to familial conflict. Cannot recommend this, nor the short film adapted from it, enough."

Und trotzdem: Es lohnt sich, denn „Das dritte Licht“ ist eine eine zarte, dichte Erzählung über Familienbande und Zuneigung, die nachhallt.Wir befinden uns im Irland der 1980er Jahre. Ein kleines Mädchen, höchstens zehn, soll den Sommer bei einem Ehepaar verbringen, das es (bisher) nicht kennt. Ihre eigene Familie hat mit zahlreichen Problemen zu kämpfen: Der Vater trinkt und spielt, die Mutter ist schwanger – schon wieder. Das Geld ist knapp und noch ein Maul zu stopfen, wird nicht einfach werden. Sich um eines der Kinder nicht kümmern zu müssen, ist offenbar ein verlockender Gedanke. Als die Kleine bei ihrer neuen Familie ankommt, wird schnell klar, dass hier vieles anders ist. Die Kinsellas sind liebend, fürsorglich, leise, fördernd. Sie nehmen das Mädchen auf, binden es ein und geben ihm ein liebevolles Zuhause. Doch diese gestohlene Zeit wird endlich sein – schließlich geht es zurück zu den Eltern.Nie verlässt Keegan in ihrer schmalen Erzählung die Gedankenwelt des Mädchens. Dadurch klingt vieles nur an. Vieles wird beobachtet und erzählt, aber natürlich nicht vollends verstanden – das wird dem Leser überlassen. Dadurch passiert das meiste in diesem kleinen Band zwischen den Zeilen, zwischen den Sätzen, in den Pausen. Diese leise, nachdenkliche, fast schon melancholische Grundstimmung speist die Kraft und den Sog von „Das dritte Licht“. Keegan erzählt – schon aufgrund der gewählten Perspektive – sehr zurückhaltend, nie plakativ. Sie lässt den Leser selbst denken und zu Schlüssen kommen und durch diese Freiheit entfaltet sich die ganze Stärke dieser Erzählung.Beizuwohnen, wie dieses kleine Mädchen ganz offenbar zum ersten Mal in seinem Leben liebevolle Zuwendung und das Interesse von Erwachsenen erfährt, ist berührend. Erst mit dieser überraschenden Erfahrung erkennt sie auch mehr und mehr die Defizite ihrer eigenen Familiensituation. Und doch kommt hier nie Bitterkeit ins Spiel, alle handelnden Personen nehmen die ihnen zugewiesenen Rollen als gottgegeben hin und arrangieren sich mit den Karten, die ihnen das Leben ausgeteilt hat.„Das dritte Licht“ überzeugt trotz seiner Kürze mit einer sprachlichen Intensität, die von der ersten Seite an packt. Das macht nur noch neugieriger auf mehr von Claire Keegan! Und wer zusätzlich zum Lesen auch noch Schauen will, der kann sich die im letzten Jahr herausgekommene Verfilmung von „Das dritte Licht“ vornehmen: „The Quiet Girl“."

Enviada a pasar el verano con una pareja de granjeros sin hijos, se nos presenta un agudo contraste entre su vida familiar, llena de pobreza y dificultades, y la calidez y cuidado con que los Kinsellas la acogen, introduciéndola a una realidad hasta entonces desconocida.La escritura de Keegan es un manantial de sensibilidad y minuciosidad. Cada palabra y frase parece haber sido escogida con un cuidado sublime para evocar el paisaje, la atmósfera y las emociones de los personajes. La obra está llena de momentos significativos que resuenan, creando un mundo rico y pleno, delicadamente elaborado, que convierte su lectura en una experiencia envolvente y gratificante.Uno de los temas principales es la pérdida. La niña y los Kinsellas han experimentado pérdidas profundas, y a lo largo de la historia, cada uno aprende a enfrentar y procesar estas experiencias. El otro tema es la idea de la familia y el hogar, y cómo estas ideas pueden ser más una cuestión de las personas que nos cuidan y aman que de los lazos de sangre.Esta narración es realmente sorprendente, me expuso a la cruda realidad del sufrimiento inherente a la existencia, a los destellos transitorios de aquello que nos es inalcanzable, y al duelo por las identidades que nunca podremos adoptar. La habilidad de Keegan para decir tanto en tan pocas palabras es asombrosa. Su estilo me recuerda a Chéjov, pues en sus relatos hay un rastro persistente de empatía, atención meticulosa a los detalles que revelan más de lo que aparentan, y un sutil manejo de las cuestiones éticas que se derivan de la crueldad y el sufrimiento tanto de los observadores como de aquellos directamente afectados.'Tres Luces' es un relato conmovedor y bellamente plasmado que trata temas universales y complejos de manera delicada y matiz.'Tres Luces' es un relato conmovedor y bellamente plasmado que trata temas universales y complejos de manera delicada y matizada. Claire Keegan demuestra su habilidad al construir y desarrollar su historia, guiándote por un viaje emocional a través de la vida de una niña durante un verano que cambia su vida."
290,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57961368-jacquiwine,Rating 5 out of 5,"When I look back over the last three months, Claire Keegan’s beautiful novella Small Things Like These stands out as one of my favourite recent reads. Set in a small town in County Wexford in the run-up to Christmas 1985, the book tells the story of Bill Furlong, a thoroughly decent, hardworking man who stays true to his personal values when he sees worrying signs of abuse at the local convent. It’s a deeply affecting story about standing up to the Catholic Church and doing right by those around you, even if it puts your family’s security at risk.Clocking in at under 100 pages, Foster is an earlier novella in a similar style, drawing on themes of family, kindness and compassion from a child’s point of view. It’s a gorgeous book, just as exquisitely written as Small Things Like These, confirming Keegan as one of my favourite Irish writers alongside the wonderful Maeve Brennan.As Foster opens, a young girl from Clonegal, County Carlow is being driven to County Wexford by her father, Dan. There she will stay with relatives, an aunt and uncle she doesn’t know, with no mention of a return date or the nature of the arrangement. The girl’s mother, Mary, is expecting a baby, and with a large family to support, the couple have chosen to take the girl to Wexford to ease the burden at home.Almost immediately the girl detects some differences in her new environment with John and Edna Kinsella. Like the girl’s parents, the Kinsellas are country folk, living and working on a farm – and yet the atmosphere feels more relaxed here than at home, less rushed with more space to think and breathe.With my mother it is all work: us, the butter-making, the dinners, the washing up and getting up and getting ready for Mass and school, weaning calves, and hiring men to plough and harrow the fields, stretching the money and setting the alarm. But this is a different type of house. Here there is room, and time to think. There may even be money to spare. (p. 12)The story is narrated by the young girl herself (whose name we never learn), a viewpoint that gives the novella a beautiful sense of intimacy, perfectly capturing the uncertainty of not knowing how the future will pan out.To read the rest of my review, please visit:https://jacquiwine.wordpress.com/2022..."

The girl's mother Mary is in the family way and the family has more mouths to feed than the number of hands that can work. The girl doesn't know the foster family or she has never been to their house ever. She is unsure of how her life is going to be here. What she doesn't realize is that she was going to bloom there physically and enamored in love in bits and pieces. Does this last forever or is her stint at the foster home going to end? Read on to check this amazing story out** This is my first story by the author and I loved her writing. Beautiful prose and the emotions are so raw and everything seems so real. The picturization of the rural Irish farmland has been done in such a beautiful way. You feel like you are there and you belong there. ** The characters are so well etched without giving too much of a backstory about any of them. You read more into the story to understand about each of them. ** The writing is not over the top and the hidden cues in the story makes you feel that you are discovering more about the story and the characters. This is something that I really loved. The story evokes emotions in the reader and for sure its not sappy emotions. My heart went for the little girl and the foster parents. The love Kinsella (foster dad) shows on the little girl in different ways without going over the top and the way Kinsella's wife also showers her love on the girl in totally different ways is so beautifully written. This shows the author's writing power. I really wanted to have more of the story. This is a short but a very beautiful story that stays with you.My rating is 4.5 rounded to 5

“This water is cool and clean as anything I have ever tasted; it tastes of my father leaving, of him never having been there, of having nothing after he was gone.”

If this is any indication of Claire Keegan’s talent, the hype is no lie. I’m a HUGE fan of short stories with subtext, and there’s tons of that here, but it’s the voice of the story that captivated me. It held me in a spell for most of its length, with a lilt that transports the reader to its Irish setting. Here, we meet the protagonist as she is separated from her blood by poverty and patriarchy and placed in foster care. It is in this new role that she finds, for the first time, a different kind of family, where shame and guilt are chased away, and understands the transformative power of wealth, how it shapes our relationships, affords us time to savour them, and how without it, we are vulnerable to vice and degradation. Keegan lends the tale an eerie atmosphere, plagued by uncertainty, by the omnipresent dangers of growing up as a girl, culminating with a passing suggestion of the otherworldly, so that you’re always waiting for the shoe to drop, expecting something devastating to transpire... until you realise that she was showing you another sort of upheaval all along."

Il ne faut pas y voir de désintérêt de ma part mais de ce roman lumineux (ou de cette nouvelle, à moins qu'il ne s'agisse finalement d'un conte...) moins on en dit, mieux c'est ! Car ici, Claire Keegan laisse le lecteur libre de ressentir le foisonnement des émotions et des sentiments que son histoire suscite, celle toute simple d'une petite fille en manque d'amour et d'attention, recueillie le temps d'un été par un coupe de fermiers taiseux et taciturnes.Parenthèse enchantée dans un quotidien fait d'indifférence, l'auteure décrit avec beaucoup de pudeur et de délicatesse, la vie et l'épanouissement de la fillette à mesure que celle-ci découvre la bienveillance et l'amour sincère de ses hôtes. Claire Keegan suggère, par petites touches subtiles, comment, au rythme de la nature et des travaux de la ferme, un lien fort et tendre naîtra de ces trois personnages fragiles et attachants.Un petit bijou de littérature, délicatement ciselé, qui me réconcilie avec le genre de la nouvelle et que j'aurais aimé voir scintiller un peu plus longtemps...

Claire Keegan’s 2010 novella “Foster” has been published in the US, and it’s as wonderful as “Small Things Like These”.An unnamed girl of about 7 is sent to stay the summer with relatives on their farm. She is the first-person narrator and we “see” and understand more than she does at her young age. She comes from a large family where she is somewhat neglected. At the farm with John and Edna she is loved and cared for; she blooms. (John calls her “Petal” towards the end, but it’s unclear if that’s her name as he has several pet names for her.)I did not want it to end. I did not want her magical summer to end. I even stopped reading 10 pages from the end because I needed a break to “collect myself” for the ending. Keegan is an amazing writer. She can convey in just a few pages what others can not in hundreds of pages. She doesn’t “tell” the story, she “shows” it to the reader. Now, I’m going to go read it again."

It is very short, 10k words, 50 pages at most. The ending is, and I am probably too prosaic, odd, what it ends like that? What next?

Básicamente, cuenta la historia de una niña cuya madre está por dar a luz, entonces la dejan al cuidado de unos parientes. En esta casa, ella encontrará una muy distinta a la suya, pero que con el correr del tiempo se irá haciendo cada vez más parte de sí misma. Tres luces narra pocos días en la vida de esta niña, aunque suficientes para distinguir la trasformación que se ve en ella. Pasando por distintos hechos (algunos más importantes que otros) que la irán marcando, el lector tendrá la posibilidad de vivir la vida de una niña que debe abandonar su casa temporariamente para pasar a otra diferente, con todo lo que eso conlleva en la perspectiva de una persona tan joven como ella. Una persona que piensa que su mundo anterior es el mundo, hasta que se topa con otras posibilidades que hubieran sido difíciles de imaginar. Me gustó mucho la prosa de la autora y cómo consigue que nos metamos de lleno en los pensamientos de la protagonista y cómo esta vive su nueva vida. Fue como si nosotros mismos, los lectores, estuviéramos todo el tiempo presenciando lo que pasaba, aunque sin intervenir. Esto no es para nada fácil de lograr; es más, hay muchos libros que terminan no convenciendo porque no es posible empatizar con el mundo que narran ni con los propios personajes. Por suerte, este no es el caso. La historia en sí es bastante simple, pero está muy bien llevada. Una historia de menos de 100 páginas invita a seguir. Igualmente, sería una lástima que uno termine un libro porque es corto. Eso significaría que no te brindó nada, que no tuvo nada que te llame la atención más allá de su corta longitud. En cambio, Tres luces no solo se termina rápido por su cantidad de páginas, sino que el contexto que narra es atrayente y atrapante; todo esto, atravesado por el importantísimo cómo. Es muy interesante cómo la autora, a partir de un estilo sencillo y cuidado, logra cautivar y hacer que un argumento simple se convierta en una historia más profunda.En conclusión, Tres luces es una historia muy atractiva más que nada por cómo está llevada. Una lectura muy entretenida, contada por alguien que sabe cómo narrar y nos permite, mediante su elegante estilo, formar parte de ella. "

Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing’Foster by Claire Keegan is a story set in Ireland in rural Wexford, in the 1980s. It tells of a young girl who is fostered to the Kinsella family over the summer months. This story is based on the juxtaposition of her life with her own family, and of that with her foster family. It is a story of hope, friendship and a glimpse into a better life. Keegan has a beautiful writing style- what she doesn’t say is just as important as what she does say. This is apparent through the way she describes the Kinsella family, in that it shows the reader how little the girl’s own family cares for her. The Kinsella’s are a childless couple, and they care for the girl as if she were their own, buying her beautiful clothes and bring her on days out. She feels accepted, and has the opportunity to prosper under the care of this family. The girl learns a different, better way of living, so different from what she was used to. Another aspect of this story I enjoyed was the Ireland Keegan portrayed in this book. She describes an Ireland not of darkness and despair, but one that has hope. As the story is set during the summer months, this contributes to the portrayal of a better Ireland. This story contrasts greatly to other books written during this period, and it is refreshing to see such love and compassion in a story. I give this book a rating of 4 out of 5 stars, both for its originality and in how well the writer contrasts the life the young girl leads with both families. "

This touching novella is the furthest thing imaginable from flashy, and yet I was dazzled. Winner of the Davy Byrnes Memorial Prize. My heartfelt thanks to @groveatlantic and @netgalley for the advance review copy. All thoughts are my own.Our setting is Ireland in the 1980s. We meet an unnamed girl, driving with her father to a farm to visit relatives she hasn’t seen since she was a baby. We soon realize that her parents have too many mouths to feed, and that the girl’s relatives have agreed to foster her for an indefinite period of time. The story is told from the girl’s perspective, “in the eyes of a child” so to speak, with the emotion just below the surface, ready to burst free at any moment… Oh my gosh, I LOVED this book and I LOVE LOVE LOVE this author. Keegan is the queen of quiet, the sultan of subtle, the virtuoso of things left unsaid. And I am so sick of this expression but, yes, for being so small (89 pages) the book packs a mean punch. What an achievement, truly.Lately, I’ve been preferring shorter works, and Keegan knows how to get to the heart of things efficiently, without needing any superfluous words. There’s no fluff, there’s no showing off, it’s just pure depth. Be still, my heart! I can’t offer a higher compliment to Keegan than that.I’m not typically pushy with my recommendations, but this fantastic piece deserves my very highest endorsement. I encourage you to pick this up pronto, and grab Small Things Like These while you’re at it! You can read either, or even both, in one sitting. The emotion and the kindness on display makes this perfect for the holiday season, a time when I think we all strive to be just that little bit more compassionate. Now please excuse me while I go read it again…"

Atmospheric. Beautiful. Devastating. Honed with absolute precision.I read this novella, as I'm sure many others also did, because of all the buzz surrounding Keegan's more recent novella, Small Things Like These, which was short-listed for last year's Booker Prize. I was floored by that one, but Foster completely knocked me out. Although (deceptively) simpler in terms of subject matter, for me it packed even more of an emotional punch. The story itself is uncomplicated. A young girl is taken in for the summer by the Kinsellas, a kind married couple distantly related to her mother. Her parents have more children than they can provide for, both in terms of sustenance and love, and have yet another on the way. The Kinsellas are a loving couple who carry a deep sadness, and care for the girl as if she were their own. The short summer they spend together has a profound emotional impact on all of them. As soon as I finished Foster, I went right back to the beginning and read it again. And one more time. And then went online and ordered Keegan's other 3 books that the library doesn't carry. There is no fluff, not a single sentence that doesn't serve a purpose in driving the story forwards. This novella is a work of art and should be a staple in all literature curricula."
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32098685-chris,Rating 4 out of 5,"""Foster"" is a beautiful short story about the need for love and the effect bestowing and withholding love has on a human being. A neglected young girl is sent to live with her aunt and uncle one summer while her mother delivers another baby in an already full household. The girl is barely fed, clothed, and tolerated in her own home. When her father drops her off he doesn't even leave a suitcase of belongings for her. But under the melancholy yet tender care of her aunt and uncle the young girl thrives over the summer. The relatives harbor a secret of temporary tragic negligence that makes them cherish the newcomer. But like the itinerant Fern from the movie ""Nomadand"" who says ""I'm houseless, not homeless. There's a difference."", there's a difference between temporary negligence and neglect. Anyone who has raised a child knows that you can guard him or her with your life but terrible things can happen if you just look away for a split second. Parents can spend the rest of their lives in self-reproach over a negligent act and there are few opportunities for redemption. But neglect is worse because it is ongoing and deprives the individual of dignity, self-worth, and love. ""Foster"" ends ambiguously but the author, Claire Keegan, makes it abundantly clear which set of parents she is siding with - the same ones I sided with. And if the reader was allowed to add a paragraph in closing, he or should would end the ambiguity in favor of redemption."

Η μικρή που έρχεται στο σπίτι τον Κινσελα για να περάσει το καλοκαίρι φέρνει το φως στις καρδιές τους, απαλύνει τον πόνο ,ξεθωριάζει το μαύρο που τους περικλείει και νιώθουν και πάλι ζωντανοί. Ένα βιβλίο που θα σας αγγίξει χωρίς να χρειαστεί να πει πολλά... Ένα βιβλίο που μπορεί οι λέξεις του να φαίνονται ότι έρχονται σαν χάδι αλλά θα τις νιώσετε στιγμές σαν χαστούκι που έρχεται να σας ταρακουνήσει και να ξυπνήσει τα οποία ίχνη ενσυναίσθησης σας έχετε..."

This was among her recommendations in Irish literature. Of course it was. As I had checked this one out, so it went to the top of the reading list. A novella, I inhaled this in one sitting. Before returning it, I think I’ll go back and savor. The language is sparse and lets the reader be smart. The words are chosen so well, multitudes are relayed with so little. If this is exemplary, Claire Keegan may join the echelons of my favorite authors. I seem to have a penchant for Irish and UK writers.)It’s an art to choose the right words that will convey such emotion. So much is said with so little. One summer. One small girl. The scope is small, but its accomplishment is huge. I am wrecked. NOTE: Coincidentally, I came upon a trailer of a movie aptly called “The Quiet Girl,” a film adaptation of FOSTER. It’s an award-winning Irish-language film that has made a huge splash. Apple TV tells me I can preorder for $9.99 without giving an ETA. The trailer is gorgeous, as is the young, Irish actor who brings our previously unnamed narrator to life. I read it doesn’t deviate too much from the page. It may do this extraordinary novel justice.

328,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32345761-abigail-bok,Rating 5 out of 5,"This was my first venture into Claire Keegan’s writing and it blew me away. I love indirection in fiction and this is definitely a story that lives between the lines.The narrator is a child, and at the start of the story she is taken by her father and dropped, without explanation, at the farm of two strangers. Nobody bothers to explain why she’s there, how long she is to stay, or even who they are, through she has a vague sense they are related to her mother. This state of affairs gives the story a 1950s feel, since that was an era in which adults didn’t explain much to children and certainly didn’t explain their traumas. But the narrator is quite observant and the attentive reader gradually picks up what is not said.The setting is rural Ireland and the characters are what are patronizingly called “simple folk,” but Keegan accords them full respect for their humanity, subtlety, and complexity. The writing is spare but resonant and it’s impossible not to become attached to the child narrator and those she loves. The ending is a heartbreaker.This is a longish short story, not a novel, and I inhaled it over the course of an evening in a beautifully designed hardcover edition that I’ll keep on my shelves forever."

I finished reading a book last night about a lost child that was 300 pages long and took me a week to slog through. I sat down and read Foster this morning and am now sobbing my eyes out after 92 pages that packed more punch, emotion, history, feeling, scene and character development than most writers can even attempt to get close to in four times the pages. Her writing is immaculate. Absolutely intensely incredibly beautiful. "
