It's more of a collection of essays, ""blog posts"" and articles you'd see on HuffPo (or perhaps NPR).There are some parts of the 'book' that were well researched, provided excellent points and I thought to myself ""oh wow"" and ""I'm going to have to read this again!!!"" Then there were other parts that I was like ""WHAT IS THIS?"" and ""WHY IS THIS HERE?"" The writing also oscillated between deplorable to somewhat academic. There are times where it reads like a polished, academic book but more often it is ranty with slang like ""Cray cray"" and vulgar examples that Manson seems to slip in for shock value except it doesn't work.Manson is also a terrible narrator. His voice isn't just bleh, but he can't even seem to properly read his own writing--he can't deliver his own jokes and punchlines. It comes out awkward and unnatural-- making his ""cray cray"" and other slang even more distracting.I also kept having a revolving thought, ""DAMN THIS IS SOME RICH WHITE MALE PRIVILEGE & MANSPLAINING"" not that the subjects he approached where ""white male privilege shit"" (though there is some of that) but that he seems to overlook privilege quite a bit.Yet there were some parts of the book that I thought were excellent, though most of them were rehashing from other outstanding books I've read such as Thinking, Fast and Slow, Ryan Holiday/Stoicism, Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress or anything by Pinkner, Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard or anything by Chip & Dan Heath, plus Nietzsche & Plato. His last bit on AI was interesting, though I suspect that was parlayed from somewhere/someone else.(UPDATE after more thought and discussion, this isn't a 3-star, it's a 2-star)"
1,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50052871-ella,Rating 5 out of 5," This book will not be a well loved book. I only say this because as a person who has read a lot of his articles as well as his previous book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, there are a lot of concepts in this book that can be perceived as radical, and possibly downright offensive. The keyword is perceived. When you come into this book hoping and/or believing that this book will affirm all of your biases, all of your hopes and dreams, all of what you stand for, then you wouldn't have a great time. This book talks about philosophy, human existence, psychology, democracy, religion, politics, money, etc. and it takes quite a controversial but rational standpoint on these fields. Yes, sometimes while reading this book it'll be difficult to get through some of the philosophical concepts. Yes, sometimes (or most times) you will get offended by what Mark says. And yes, you would want to put the book down.But don't. Instead, read on, or better yet, reflect first as to why you feel the way you feel. Don't succumb to the dichotomy of ""good"" and ""bad"" feelings i.e., if you feel offended, don't automatically assume that it's because what Mark wrote was wrong and you're right. This book calls upon reflection of everything ugly in all of us, and if you can't keep your biases at bay, or on hold, you will not enjoy reading this book.But, if you go into this with an open mind, prepared to feel both validated and hurt, both offended and reassured, then I think this would be a great reading experience for you. Overall, I gave this book 5 stars, because just like The Subtle Art, it called into question everything I believed, and for me, it strengthened some of my beliefs, and weakened others. A first for me in a long time."

The writing is insufferable, he grossly oversimplifies ideas that need a more nuanced view, makes preposterous generalizations about mental health and related concepts, and generally makes you wonder what his point really is. Not sure how he gets published, but seems to be riding a strange wave with the word *fuck* in his titles."
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11087982-uddipta,Rating 1 out of 5,"Did not finish.He starts off by mentioning the holocaust, how people had ""real"" problems back then, compared to us who are now weeping at minor inconveniences behind closed doors: crying for an ex, crying because someone was rude to us, etc. I find this comparison disgusting and I mean it. The problems back then were physical and very different. There was no internet back then. Now, in the internet age, we have lots of things to compare ourselves with. Everyday, whether we want it or not, we are constantly reminded of the things we lack. And at the end of the day, when we reach home, it takes a family or a closed one to help us forget those things. Secondly, the writing. He speaks of things in a very patronizing manner which I found really irritating and was what made me drop this book. I loved his first book and on my worst days, it provides a sense of comfort unlike anything. But this book, I don't know what happened with the author. I am not trying to find comfort, but maybe just give me some substance. Time is precious and I cannot waste it anymore after getting into 20% of this one. Maybe he got too much into himself. Now that he is rich, he forgot how to relate to the common folks. This book is indeed ""f*cked""."

 What made Mark Mason's first book a huge success was the freshness in the idea he was trying to discuss. But now, when the second book is published, there are many books with the same theme already published and read by the readers. Even if the author tries to treat a few chapters differently, there is a high probability that the readers will be bored after reading a few chapters of this book.The author attempts to take a different approach in some chapters by trying to discuss philosophy, epistemology, and ontology. He tries to discuss ideas shared by some great people like Friedrich Nietzsche, Bertrand Russell, and Yuval Noah Harari. You will feel these portions as just average if you are a follower of the above philosophers and have read their books. Still, I must admit that it was a brave attempt by the author to think out of the box, especially after the massive success of his initial book.The condescending manner in which he discusses this book will also be boring to some readers who have already finished the author's first book. I feel that he should have been a little more careful while describing mental health. Despite all these negatives, you will get some critical ideas that might be helpful to you.
My favorite three lines from this book. 


 ""Because pain is the universal constant of life, the opportunities to grow from that pain are constant in life. All that is required is that we don't numb it, that we don't look away. All that is required is that we engage it and find the value and meaning in it."" 


 ""You must love someone without expecting anything in return; otherwise it's not true love. You must respect someone without expecting anything in return; otherwise you don't truly respect him. You must speak honestly without expecting a pat on the back or a high-five or a gold star next to your name; otherwise you aren't truly being honest."" 

 ""Ultimately, the most meaningful freedom in your life comes from your commitments, the things in life for which you have chosen to sacrifice."" 
The negatives in this book are greater in number compared to the author's first book. Still, some great points are hidden in a few corners, like a few of the above lines I shared. If you are someone who liked the author's first book, you can give this book a try."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52402667-adam-woods,Rating 4 out of 5,"Something is very wrong with the world. It’s us. We have abandoned our quest for character in favour of one for happiness and we have created a world of diversions that give the illusion of freedom but in fact keep us docile and imprisoned.Manson has written a book that will stay with me for a while. This very well-researched exploration into human virtues (and hope in particular) isn’t exactly warm and fuzzy. Nor is it pessimistic. In fact it is paradoxically optimistic for a book that genuinely and convincingly lays out that everything is indeed f*cked!His trademark wit is still on display but Manson strikes a slightly more academic tone than in his first book, which was a welcome change of pace. In fact this book has inspired me to learn more about Manson’s (and the world’s) philosophical greats and read a few of his sources. I think that’s a good thing.Manson, once again, holds a mirror up to the reader, which can be confronting (in a good way), and makes demands on us to be better. Not merely hope to be better. But BE better. And that’s a message I can get behind.Give this book a go..."
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84317608-javier-lorenzana,Rating 1 out of 5,"I really wanted to like this book. As a fan of Mark Manson, I enjoyed his at-times comical writing style and humorous anecdotes in his other books. Yet, this felt stale.The book is lazy. It's essentially a bunch of repackaged Nietzsche and Harari stuffed together without any flow whatsoever. The central theme of hope acts as a loose umbrella topic to otherwise disconnected chapters. The book talks about subjects right out of Sapiens and Homo Deus by Yuval Harari. The only difference is that Manson inserts his unique voice in this commentary, including a lot of 'f*cks.' Sounds great right? Not exactly. The subjects are oversimplified, the language feels condescending at times, and the charm that Manson usually puts on in his books was nonexistent.What made Manson's earlier books good was that he spoke from experience about topics he was passionate about. But this attempt into deeper subjects doesn't cut it. It is neither comprehensive nor original. It's just not as good as other books in its field.TL/DR: Just read Harari and Nietzsche."

Amazing read, push through the first few chapters and you’ll see how it all ties together in the end!"
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa,Rating 2 out of 5,"The book was a meaningless string of random thoughts and stoic philosophy and meditation. It was funny at parts, but mostly just a few interesting stories and cliches that are set up as being new insight. Also, I don't buy stoicism and meditation as a way forward. I am still interested in progress and I do think social movements can make people's lives better. Manson seems to think it's all just vain showing off and we should all just chill, but life isn't about peace and happiness. We also search meaning."

10,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17745108-david-lee,Rating 5 out of 5,"Smart and funny, this book will help you make sense of your mind and the world we live inIf you liked Subtle Art, you'll enjoy this too. I couldn't put it down, actually, reading it in under a day. Mark has a talent for taking potentially boring subject matter, such as the teachings of philosophers, and bringing it to life in easy-to-understand language (with plenty of expletives). I especially liked his Consciousness Car metaphor in explaining the Thinking Brain vs Feeling Brain (would love to see an animated cartoon version), and thoughts on antifragility and how we benefit by choosing to accept (and even seek out) discomfort in our lives.If you've been feeling like the world is a mess (especially in terms of politics) lately, this book can help you make sense of what's going on. And, it includes some takeaways we as individuals can use to help make a positive difference for ourselves, and by extension, society. "
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17322218-fran-cormack,Rating 2 out of 5,"I wish I had enjoyed this book more. I really wanted to. I so enjoyed Mark's first book, I had high hopes for this one. Alas, I found it uninspiring, and without much direction. Lots of rambling, with famous people from history thrown in, for which I never saw the connection. It felt a little forced. Contrived even. Like Mark is really, really trying to fill a book. I will be watching for what he writes next, and hope to get my love back for Mr Manson."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7986781-heidi-the-reader,Rating 3 out of 5,"This creatively titled self-help book, Everything is F*cked, presents psychology, philosophy and the author's view of reality. In a series of essays, Mark Manson discusses a variety of topics including the differences between the ""thinking brain"" and ""feeling brain."" He uses Isaac Newton's laws to create a parallel universe's version of emotional laws and completes a fairly scathing dissection of religion. Throughout the various topics, he circles back to the idea of hope and how it can potentially create more problems than it solves.Why did Manson write a book about hope?""This book is my little source of hope. It gives me purpose; it gives me meaning. And the narrative that I've constructed around hope is that I believe this book might help some people, that it might make both my life and the world a little bit better."" pg 15I did not read Manson's other incredibly popular title, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life, so I went into this one not knowing what to expect. I found Manson to be particularly adept at breaking down complex topics into simple, easy-to-understand analogies.For example, here's his take on the psychological cause of a underlying feeling of unworthiness: ""This feeling of unworthiness is usually the result of some bad sh*t happening to us at some point. We suffer through some terrible stuff, and our Feeling Brain decides that we deserved those bad experiences. Therefore, it sets out, despite the Thinking Brain's better knowledge, to repeat and re-experience that suffering."" pg 46And here's the analogy he crafts around his explanation of unworthiness: ""Put another way, the problem isn't that we don't know how not to get punched in the face. The problem is that, at some point, likely a long time ago, we got punched in the face, and instead of punching back, we decided we deserved it."" pg 46His writing is simple and succinct, which could be incredibly useful for readers who are looking for more information about the self help topics presented. I didn't particularly care for Manson's overall style, but that's a personal preference rather than a commentary on the value of what he's discussing.""The stories of our future define our hopes. And our ability to step into those narratives and live them, to make them reality, is what gives our lives meaning."" pg 70I think this author may be similar to Sarah Knight and her series of self help books about The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k. Readers either love or hate those, I fell somewhere in between.My favorite part of this was when Manson dived into some Buddhist philosophy in the chapter, ""Pain is the Universal Constant."" He discusses the teaching of suffering being similar to a person struck by arrows. The first arrow brings physical pain and the second brings the emotional pain, which can be far worse and last longer than the physical pain because of the narratives we weave around it. Through meditation, the second arrow, emotional pain, can be diminished or perhaps eliminated.""That while pain is inevitable, suffering is always a choice. That there is always a separation between what we experience and how we interpret that experience. That there's always a gap between what our Feeling Brain feels and what our Thinking Brain thinks. And in that gap, you can find the power to bear anything."" pg 186Recommended for readers who aren't offended by strong language and have the ability to hold the book they're reading in that gap in their minds — between the thoughts and the emotions, in the space of pure being. I'll meet you there. :)"

14,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"How this guy keeps getting published I will never understand. Why I keep reading his books is something else I cannot understand. However, I saw it was marked 50% off at B&N, so I went ahead and bought it. I have read through it while doing cardio after lifting and can say that it is awful. It is more-or-less his other book rehashed with different wording. Not to mention, he misunderstands concepts but uses them throughout his book anyway.He states, ""Nihilism and the pure indulgence of desire that accompanies it are gripping the modern world. It is power for the sake of power. Success for the sake of success. Pleasure for the sake of pleasure...It aheres to no great truth or cause. It's a simple ""Because it feels good."" He doesn't understand Nihilism or Nietzsche, even though he uses both throughout his text. Nihilism was not a hedonistic philosophy. Full stop. I'm out.F*ck Mark Manson."
15,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"After loving The Subtle Art, I found this a real disappointment. It was very dry and lacking the playfulness of his first book. I also found it hard to track the overarching ‘story’ of the book, it felt more like a jumbled collection of articles. Just couldn’t connect to it in any meaningful way"
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77383456-sam,Rating 4 out of 5,"Everything is Fucked is a much more mature book than his last. While in the last book we looked at things we shouldn't care about, this book more focuses on what to care about. And I have to say that this book was really well done, and in my opinion, better than his last.This book will definitely leave you feeling different than when you started it. I never take notes while reading a book, but this one time I did, because a lot will stick with you, and you won't want to forget it. ""Don't hope for better. Just be better""This book covers lots of different topics: Hope, maturity, religion, social media, technology etc. It covers a lot more than his previous book, and for the better. Mark really shows us what's wrong with the world in this book, and what we can do to fix it, while also having his signature ""fuck you"" sort of humour. Some of the things that I read were kind of obvious (don't be a dick, act like an adult and not like a child etc) but he goes into more detail than that, and really makes you question how you act as an individual. ""The pursuit of happiness is a toxic value that has long defined our culture. It is self-defeating and misleading. Living well does not mean avoiding suffering; it means suffering for the right reasons. Because if we're going to be forced to suffer by simply existing, we might as well learn how to suffer well""Like his last book, Mark gives us some really interesting historical events that eventually lead to his main point that he is trying to make. I personally found that some of them were a bit dragged out and went on for a little too long, and I found that I ended up missing the point he was trying to make due to the example being very long. However this is just my opinion, and isn't necessarily a bad thing, just my personal taste. I will say that some of the events he tells are amazing and eye opening, and will definitely leave an impact on you.""When we deny ourselves the ability to feel pain for a purpose, we deny ourselves the ability to feel any purpose in our life at all""This book is a much more satisfying, mature, and deeper book than his last. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to view things with a different eye, and is open to changing the way they are as a person. And while not everything in this book is breathtakingly amazing, it will still leave an impact on you for a long time."
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4671027-miquixote,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book’s thesis has already been written. Many times. This is stoicism. This is Nietzsche. This is Kant. This fact does not reduce the subject's interest whatsoever. I post 2 reviews below: A Pop Culture Full Metal Alchemist Review (recommended if you have some symptoms of A.D.D): “A lesson without pain is meaningless. That's because no one can gain without sacrificing something. But by enduring that pain and overcoming it, he shall obtain a powerful, unmatched heart. A fullmetal heart. That is alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange. In those days, we really believed that to be the world's one, and only, truth. But the world isn't perfect, and the law is incomplete. Equivalent Exchange doesn't encompass everything that goes on here, but I still choose to believe in its principle, that all things do come at a price, that there's an ebb and a flow, a cycle, that the pain we went through did have a reward, and that anyone who's determined and perseveres will get something of value in return, even if it's not what they expected.” “The truth is cruel but right.”“You see, I'm sure we can change. Because we're weak. And because we die. We have to fight in order to live, and that's what will make us strong” “Stand up and walk. Move on. After all, you have perfect legs to stand on.” ― Hiromu Arakawa The Nit-Picky Review, or if you have O.C.D. symptoms (with spoilers): Mark’s Uncomfortable Truth: Pleasant feelings are evidently not Mark’s goal here. He wants us to grow through pain since it’s the only universal constant. Bertrand Russell, for one, would say be wary of those who glorify pain because the historical antecedents are not impressive. The fun is in deciding how far in which direction you will go. The Classic Assumption: Thinking vs. Feeling. We quickly learn why Mark swears so much: humans have no self control. The classic assumption, says Mark, is that our Thinking Brains are in control: Plato onwards, through the Christian ages, until very recently were proponents. Kahneman and Tversky in 2011 revolutionized thinking theory and suggest otherwise. Mark here says the feeling brain actually calls the shots. Needless to say, it’s been a popular activity to imagine our brains are divided in two, the feeling brain and the thinking brain. Mark joins the frenzy:1.	Plato. Reason (thinking brain), spirit (feeling brain), and appetites2.	Hume: Impressions (Feeling) or Ideas (Thinking)3.	Freud: Ego (thinking) and Id (feeling)4.	Probably the worst theory to date: ‘Thinking Brain has balls and is from Mars, Feeling Brain has breasts and is from Venus’. 5.	Kahneman and Tversky: Feeling (fast thinking) and Thinking (slow thinking)Clown Cars: Mark’s brain theory involves seeing our feelings as cars. Clown cars (selfish narcissists) are toxic. Healthy cars see them coming a long way away and move into the slow lane, avoiding contact with them as much as possible. Clowns flock to other clown cars. Clown cars think healthy cars are boring and uninteresting. Clowns probably drive too fast, run over pedestrians and get into way too many accidents. I imagine they are literally toxic like gas-guzzling, expensive and unreliable SUVs. Clowns probably drink and drive. If they can’t get away with that, they’ll smoke pot and drive. With a Whopper in the other hand. Woodstock represents well this type of car: Times of free love, the 1960s, if it feels good do it! The New Age counterculture was clownish all the way. In fact, indulging one’s emotions is STILL often equated with great spiritual awakening. White middle-class yuppies that were raised and told that the thinking brain calls the shots, at a later age rebelled and let their feeling brain run rampant. They never really had any real problems except feeling bad and they blamed their Thinking on that. They call that turning off of the Thinking Brain ‘spiritual growth’. Sound familiar? I am SURE you know people like this…They think that self-absorption is enlightenment. But it’s still just a Clown Car with a new `spiritual’ paint job though. The Moral Gap: Our self worth equals the sum of our emotions over time. There is something here he likes to call The Moral Gap: When someone hurts you, you think: he is shit, I am righteous. If you don’t act on it, you switch to I am shit, he is righteous. It was the best or it was trauma. They hate me because they’re envious, afraid of me, don’t want to admit that I’m better? Justification of the superiority of the narcissist. No subtleties or nuances like in real life here. You’re special no matter what. And your identity will stay your identity until a new experience acts against it. Of course, there is the 3rd alternative: A High Degree of Self-Awareness, that of forgiving others and yourself. You’ll see later that only those in the Adult Development Phase are capable of this.The 3 Types of Religions: Mark suggests that all of us generally believe the key to our eternal salvation is to stop thinking critically and join any of the hope clubs below: 1. Spiritual 2. Ideological (the isms: communism, capitalism, anarchism, fascism, environmentalism, feminism, leftism, etc.) 3. Interpersonal (people worship: romantic, celebrity, children, etc.). Codependency: addicted to supporting or receiving validation from another person. Putting a person on a pedestal, the center of your world, the basis of your thoughts and feelings, the root of your self-esteem, to be your God value.The above Religions compete for resources and those that win out are those that most efficiently use labour and capital. The Root of all Social Conflict throughout History: Right vs. Left? His next target - radical leftists, with his guns all a blazing: To Mark, the true equality that all leftists are fighting for will never exist. Pain will always be there. And he’ll have us see the worst thing we can do is get rid of pain completely. We need something called ‘Legitimate Suffering’ (see The Road Less Travelled, Scott Peck). Now that it seems the leftists have been floored; we need a bully to kick the leftist while they’re down. Enter Nietzsche’s Master morality vs. Leftist’s Slave Morality. Strength, Dominance, Hierarchy vs Sacrifice, Submission, Equality; Right vs. Left; the Bullies vs. the Ressenters. Mark says Nietzsche was a globalist, rare and radical, believed in the value of a person’s deeds, nothing else, no system, no race, not nationality. And apparently Slave morality requires same beliefs, Equality and Totalitarianism. Well, now that leftism is seemingly bleeding all over the tarmac now, gasping for breath, let us take a quick reality check before the next round: Not sure here if Mark misunderstands Nietzsche, glorifies Nietzsche or cherry-picked a nibble from Nietzsche here? Let’s be absolutely clear, I mean no beating around the bush: Nietzsche loves, I mean loves, LOVES violence and ruthlessness. Not sure how much Mark wants that side of him as part of his philosophy. I mean Nietzsche just totally got erections for violence. I mean full daylight erections. Not morning hide it under the cover, wait- until-it-takes-a-chill-pill erection. Example hard to beat: Nietzsche loved Napoleon. He was like THE MAN for Nietzsche. Yes, mass murdering, war-mongering Napoleon. So, I think it’s fair to say that Nietzsche’s ethics were highly questionable (even if his criticism of religion and literary output were very important in philosophy). No, no grasping now my Nietzschian bullies, he was certainly not A BUDDHIST. To Nietzsche, the majority are only a means to the excellence of the few. Let it be known that this contradiction still does not eliminate the necessity of a conflict of ideas here. Kant vs. Nietzsche: Mark does acknowledge that Nietzsche did not believe in Kant’s ideas and scoffed at the Law of Humanity (something Mark clearly believes in here too, so we need to try to understand the apparent contradiction). Mark can’t not understand that Nietzsche was all about ends. Not means. The polar opposite of Kant in that way. I am guessing what Mark likes about Nietzsche was that he was certainly pro-pain. But Mark evidently needs to be good with Kant too. Or Mark would certainly be an all-out nasty dude. Nietzsche didn't mind being seen as nasty but something tells me Mark isn't quite ready to take that step. It gets even more problematic: Kant’s value system that transcends religion is a religion too. This led Nietzsche to accuse Kant of being absurd, naïve, and outright narcissistic (talk about calling a kettle black…). Mark concurs with Nietzsche that all beliefs are inherently imprisoned by our own perspectives and are faith-based. But Mark admits some value systems produce better and more logical results than others. Science (faith in evidence) produces the best belief systems (according to Mark). Similarly, Kant has the best basis for creating value systems: value that which perceives value above all else (consciousness). We can conclude that Kant’s belief that morality can be deduced outside religion is absolutely true and is admirable. While scientifically pursued moral philosophy is Mark’s apparent goal. But Mark suggests that conflict must exist for hope and meaning to exist and he still comes across positive about war. He says: ‘war has created the most positive innovations, it brings out the best in our character’. Yikes, not sure how far he wants to take that…So, Mark is seemingly stuck. He clearly betrays religious ideological leanings with open belief in amor fati (love of fate), Stoicism and Kant’s Formula of Humanity (where you are honest, humble and brave at all moments). But he also likes the idea of going beyond Good and Evil and is just as clearly reluctant to dismiss Nietzshe despite Fred's ruthlessness.Developmental Psychology: Despite these obvious ideological contradictions we can’t write off Mark just yet- he has more interesting stuff up his sleeve. He proceeds to explain developmental psychology theory, and how most of us are stuck at an adolescent phase: When you are a kid, you are an explorer. Then you grow up and realize there is too much to explore. A child is all about pleasure vs. pain. An adolescent learns to understand life as a transaction. He gets pleasure through bargains, as a means to a pleasurable end. Becoming an adult is doing the right thing for the simple reason that are doing the right thing. Honesty is the best example. You tell the truth as an end, not a means to get something. Because honesty is good and valuable. Sound idealistic? That’s because it is. Is this actually practicable? It reminds me of the Jim Carey movie: Liar, Liar, where a lawyer is charmed (or cursed) with the inability to lie and all the chaos that ensues. Have there been any studies about people who have actually attempted to live their lives under this Formula? Apparently there are so few people actually doing this that ‘replicability’ is an issue with any study. Suffice it to say: not enough evidence, no science. So we are in the dicey religion area still. I guess there is no way around it. (Yes Nietzsche starts jumping up and down again. He certainly wouldn't like Mark playing both sides…) But let’s ignore Nietzsche one minute, and stick with the theory for now: with this undeniably interesting theory that trauma and/or neglect cause people to get stuck in either the child or adolescent mode. And prevent us from becoming the low percentage of adults that apparently exist (some 13% in the studies that have been made, but duly note the lack of evidence and replicability). Becoming an adult involves 3 things, according to Mark: 1. Enduring pain (Nietzsche has an erection again. Fred, put that thing away!)2. Abandoning hope (this shouldn’t be taken too seriously, as you see Mark clearly has hope in science, evidence and Artificial Intelligence.)3. Letting go of the desire for more pleasant and fun things. Assuming the above as gospel, what’s holding us back from being adults?Fake Freedom: We’ve been given the blue pill for too long. It’s made us weaker and more fragile. Who is to blame? Marketing. Marketing has convinced us to be flooded with Diversions. Marketing understands how to manipulate our Feelings. Our Thinking brain hasn’t been trained to compete. And our Feeling brain is taking the Clown Car to a whole new level. Due to this Law of Diminishing Returns, this is the state of our current Character:1.	We are Fragile. We have Diminishing Values, obsessed with Comfort and Pleasure.2.	We are consumed by Low-Level Addictive Behaviours: phone, email, Netflix, Facebook, Instagram. Compulsively experiencing more stuff. Addiction produces a downward spiral, thus numbing Pain (no Pain: no Meaning and ability to find Value), generating greater Pain, and greater numbing. 3.	We have too much Choice: the more Options we have, the less Satisfaction. Consequently, we have constant Anxiety over whether we made the best Choice. This Insecurity, Doubt and Intolerance is not Freedom. It is an endless cycle of Hope. This Fake Freedom is an endless series of Transactions and Bargains which you feel you’re winning. Modern tyranny is Diversion, BS information, and Distraction. The breadth and power of the internet has created a global system of Propaganda by governments and corporations steering our desires and wishes. That is our Current Reality. Perhaps this is our Orwellian Brave New World. Big Brother is indeed watching us and steering us THROUGH Pleasure. Huxley and Orwell all in one. Mark calls Fake Freedom TOO MUCH Pleasure. We are told not to forget that maybe people actually start Revolutions because of Pleasure. Too much Pleasure and Comfort cause low tolerance for Discomfort and Inconvenience. Political Revolution then becomes a Privilege. This is called a Revolution of Rising Expectations. The leaders of the French Revolution were actually wealthy citizens. The American Revolution likewise (wealthy landowners who didn’t want to pay taxes). Prosperity, Pleasure and Convenience can thus cause a crisis in Hope. Finding Meaning is more and more difficult. But the key tipping point may be Information. Once awareness of Inequality is well-known, when it is revealed how uncontrolled Wealth has become, the Revolution of Rising Expectations may be inevitable. Maybe that’s why here Mark has footnoted Pinker and Rosling telling us things are really good? Because they know we will get pissed when we realize things aren’t actually good. We will elect demagogues and Democracy will be overturned. Prosperity, Pleasure, Convenience, lack of Hope, and Inequality awareness may just cause a Revolution. If AI doesn’t beat the people to it. Mark’s betting on AI.Education (but please, not Sparta): Obviously, Education is the only way around this. We need an educational facelift; Mark says that our Children are the masters of Pain and Antifragility (see Taleb). Maybe, but Mark let’s not start leaving our kids out during winter nights to see if they can tough it out like the Platonic ideal of Sparta actually did (see Plato’s Republic). Knowledgeable philosophy readers might be forgiven if they are alarmed by a bit too much of the less-reputable sides of Plato (and Nietzsche) here. Real Freedom? According to Mark, Real Freedom is actually Self-Limitation. Consciousness of your Time, Attention and Choices. This causes an Increase in Return. Greater Commitment. Greater Depth. Less Superficiality. We must stop hacking life. Real Freedom is victory over Desires, seeing the world unconditionally. Freedom requires nothing of the world. Just your Will. This is very Stoic. Things we can do that don’t just involve Self-Help: From an activist point of view Mark admits that online Advertising and Fake News must cease to exist. We need independent 3rd party algorithms to rate veracity of headlines. Evidence is the only life preserver in an infinite sea of Lies. This is Mark´s Hope and Religion coming out of the masturbatory sock of self-help. His hope seems to be that AI will fix this Manufacturing of Consent. The new Religion: He reminds us again and again that each subsequent Religion’s attempt at Global Harmony has only been partial and incomplete. But he has his own final Religion: AI, and us as domesticated dogs. We already submit to artificial algorithms and we love it. The best of us are shitty information processors, even if you or I can access, harness, and manipulate information better than others, we can’t compete with AI. Elon Musk was asked what could cause the end of the world. He replied with 3 possible outcomes: 1. Nuclear war. 2. Climate change. 3. ComputersMark thinks otherwise. He thinks computers will behave better than us and correct the other 2 of the above.The Richer you Are, the Sadder you Are: Technology has brought us empty, meaningless variety, and endless options. But supposedly it has reduced poverty. Forget that Reduced Poverty is patently false since the 70s, unless we are speaking about the 1%, but that doesn’t change the argument: we DO live near the top of history in quality of life. It is emphasized that the wealthier the country the more its people struggle with feelings of meaning and purpose. This book is for them. Only 10 percent in a yougov survey of people from the 17 richest countries felt the world was getting better. Wealthier countries and neighbourhoods also have higher suicide rates on average. Mark raves about Steven Pinker and Hans Rosling here. Their works are deemed in the notes as ‘excellent, indispensable and important’. Apparently, they are dead on about how lucky we all are. But Steve and Hans care nothing about how depression works. They are addicted to big stats like the GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Even from a purely statistical perspective, they lack subtlety. They don’t want or care about the mathematics of noticing that median real wages have actually reduced since the 70s (see my review of Factfulness explaining the math). So Inequality is going up big time. Mark acknowledges this although he certainly emphasizes that we have way more than enough prosperity. The difference being that Mark definitely realizes that life actually sucks for most people in rich countries. Mark suggests the problem is Lack of Meaning. To Mark, it is clear that Material prosperity is not more valuable to us than Purpose. To Hans and Steve our disconnect, our addictions, our lack of connections are not the core of life. Prosperity is. Mark Manson points out what they miss: Meaning matters. (See ‘Man’s Search For Meaning, Frankl).Some tough truths about pain vs. pleasure: Despite all the above argumentation noted, we are still missing evidence here. Remember Evidence and Science are the only Religion worth following now right? The thing is there really aren’t conclusive studies to suggest that Pain improves us. Similarly, there aren’t conclusive studies to suggest that Pleasure does either. To make it all even more confusing, there aren’t conclusive studies to suggest what the right balance is. Since we don’t have community like we used to, Inequality is worsening, we are unhappier whether Steve, Hans or Mark think we have reason to be. Mark definitely suggests we are wimps. That we need to toughen up. Maybe, but did I say that there is no conclusive evidence about all this? With all this in mind, there is no doubt your motivation, whether it’s intrinsic or extrinsic, matters. You gotta love that Mark talks about Intrinsic motivation: the simple pleasure of doing an activity well, rather than for an external reward, motivates you to continue doing that activity. Mark says that’s why he wrote the book. Not for the millions of dollars. Nice! Let’s assume it’s true. 😉In agreement with his polemics or not, give Mark Manson credit for putting passion and prudence on the scales again."

The entire book basically points out the fact that pain is universal, suffering doesn't have to be, as it's based on how we perceive our circumstances.Manson brings into the mix Nietzsche, Kant and Plato. I don't see myself reading them any time soon, but it was good to learn about some of their views.Manson also mentions everyone's ""favourite scientist"" - Einstein - who is attributed all sort of sayings and quotes that he never uttered - ie ""Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.""; ""The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results."" ""The average human only uses 10 per cent of his brain."" and so on.I appreciated learning about: The Blue Dot Effect: humans warp their perceptions to fit their expectations, ie if you look for something bad, you'll find it/see it, even when it's not there. (look it up).The last chapter on AI gave me anxiety, although he sort of puts a positive spin on it. I guess we'll wait and see, there's no escaping it."

It can be concluded that this book has a more didactic tone, that is, it goes deeper and scrutinizes our intrinsic values, showing us the myopic effect they impose on our life. The thing is Manson's previous book had a very straightforward scheme (not that I am a stalwart supporter of linear plots, actually it is the exact opposite), however, this book was deprived of the ""logical sequence of subjects"". I could barely connect, Kant's daily schedule to the sci-fi-Isaac Asimov-ending. From my standpoint, the second half of the book was the fulcrum of the entire book. As for the first half, the exorbitant information regarding ""religions"" was extraneous and could have been truncated and the same thing can be said about the last chapter. It was all way too ""predictivy like an ominous presentiment.To put it in a nutshell, Manson is trying to say what Krishna Murti was trying to say many years ago. Someone asks Murti: what is the right ""way""?and he answers: there is no ""way"".Manson tries to convey the same thing with ""hope""One must go ""beyond"" hope. To hope as Nietzche described it is fraught with danger, man should go beyond Good and Evil to transmute into something Nietzche called ""Superman"" or ""Übermensch"" . One should simply put in the action.""Don't hope for better. just be better"".This book is much deeper than his last book, it tries to convey a deeper more philosophical meaning. I can understand why some readers cannot relate to it the way they had related to his previous book. "
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90347401-elsa-rajan-pradhananga,Rating 3 out of 5,"The book starts off with the remarkable truth that  ...We are inconsequential cosmic dust, bumping and milling about on a tiny blue speck. We imagine our own importance. We invent our purpose—we are nothing. Drawing from psychological facts and the wisdom of philosophy, Mark Manson establishes with ease that hope is a mechanism to steer forward despite the uncomfortable truth of life that human existence is meaningless. The author won me over with his logic, sharp observations and interesting anecdotes. There's no denying that the emotional part brain has an upper hand when it comes to decision making and that unless the thinking and feeling parts of the brain are at an equilibrium, everything feels hopeless. It didn't feel convincing enough that us faulty algorithms may worship AI in future.  Everything is fucked  presents to readers what we have to know and not what we want to (another need for bridging the gap between our feelings and reasons) and gives us an opportunity to reflect on our beliefs rather than follow it blindly. Apparently we should shift our focus away from hope and better ourselves. Isn't that easier said than done?"

Sukses dengan buku The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, 3 tahun kemudian Mark Manson barulah melanjutkan tulisannya melalui Everything is F*cked. Buku yang sepertinya sudah ditunggu-tunggu oleh sebagian besar pembaca setianya ini lebih fokus membahas tentang hope atau harapan.Masih khas ala Manson, semuanya dibuka dengan kisah dan bahkan tragedi. Kekuatan story telling yang apik membuat pembaca bisa memahami konteks sebelum akhirnya Manson masuk ke dalam materi. Uniknya, Manson membagi buku ini menjadi dua bagian yang cukup kontras. Tentu saja, masih tentang bagaimana kita merespon kejadian-kejadian dalam semesta kita sendiri.Bagian pertama adalah tentang harapan. Bahwa manusia hidup memang dalam yang namanya Uncomfortable Truth. Ada masa-masa dalam perjalanan kita yang membuat kita tidak nyaman, tapi itu tetap harus dijalani karena memang begitulah keadaannya. Semua manusia pasti mengalami Uncomfortable Truth tetapi jangan malah menjadi hilang harapan. Sebab, karena harapan, manusia jadi memiliki semangat untuk berjuang dan berusaha keras. Uniknya, pada bab yang membahas How to Make All Your Dreams Come True, Manson menggunakan analogi agama/kepercayaan. Baginya, manusia meyakini sesuatu yang ada di luar kuasanya (meski Manson sendiri adalah seorang Atheis, ia mengakui hal tersebut) dan apabila diolah sedemikian rupa, agama/kepercayaan bisa menjadi senjata sekaligus semangat menuju harapan. Manson pun menuliskan beberapa tahapan jika ingin membuat mimpi kita terwujud melalui analogi uniknya itu.Misalnya:
""Because, as we'll see, religion is all about emotional attachment. And the best way to build those attachments is to get people to stop thinking critically.""
Sebuah satir halus namun cukup mengena.Masuk ke bagian kedua: Everything is F*cked, Manson mengajak pembaca untuk tidak memiliki harapan dan ekspektasi. Bagi Manson, memiliki harapan dan ekspektasi malah membuat rasa kecewa kita semakin besar jika hal itu tidak sesuai/tidak tercapai.Jika bagian satu Manson menggunakan banyak kisah bahkan menggunakan analogi agama/kepercayaan, di bagian kedua Manson cukup banyak mengutip cara pandang filsafat seperti Nietzsche dengan narasi ""God is dead."" Bahkan Manson juga mengutip cara pandang Stoa tentang bagaimana manusia menjalani hidup tanpa berekspektasi. Ada pula satu bab yang khusus membahas soal Pain, soal luka dan sakit. Bagi Manson, pain bukan untuk dihindari karena ia akan selalu ada. Pain hendaknya dirangkul sebagai suatu konstanta. Ia pasti ada dalam setiap fase. Secara keseluruhan, aku hanya sanggup memberikan 3 bintang. Meski cara penyampaiannya unik dan khas Manson, tapi dalam beberapa bab aku terkadang merasa jenuh dengan inti cerita yang sebenarnya masih sama dengan bab yang ada di depannya. Manson melalui buku ini memainkan peran sebagai pengingat, karena semua orang sebenarnya juga tahu tentang harapan dan ekspektasi. 
""The only true form of freedom, the only ethical form of freedom is through self-limitation. It is not the privilege of choosing everything you want in your life, but rather choosing what you will give up in your life.""
Ohiya, Manson juga memperkaya tulisannya dengan studi kasus dan data-data pendukung, termasuk bukunya Jonathan Haidt. Tulisannya bukan sembarangan hanya opini Manson semata membuat buku ini memiliki standing point sendiri. "

Mark Manson (of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck persuasion) takes us on an unorthodox journey which is supposed to be about hope, but not really. A pleasant potpourri of great minds (Nietzsche, Kant, Einstein, Kahneman), a touch of pop psychology, a smear of motivational speaking and some gratuitous shits & fucks for good measure; it's supposed to be a cool book, after all, because youth. I rarely question the academic background of an author and the argument from authority is not really my thing, but one has to marvel at Manson's vast knowledge of history of religion, existential psychology, politics and the global economy as displayed on this work (if you can't see it through the screen, I'm rolling my eyes so hard I'm getting a headache). But I digress. My final verdict?

I partially blame myself for listening the audiobook so irregularly (usually only when I am doing some copy work or other brainless things). Maybe I would've liked this book more if I had bought the physical copy and annotated my way along.

39,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11041240-zarathustra-goertzel,Rating 2 out of 5,"Unfortunately, my impression as that the further Mark deviates from dating and relationship advice, the poorer the quality becomes. I respect the effort as Mark's simple dating related advice doesn't need any additions :). Ther book lacks a coherent thread, perhaps even more so than ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck"", which was a fairly decent book. tl;dr - probably not much to be gained over the articles on his blog. And the good sections, frankly, could just be articles.Perhaps I'm simply not the audience? As a pessimist may be needed to effectively reach out to fellow pessimists, Mark writes to those who ""truly feel that everything is fucked"" (and I'm not one of them).A large theme of the book is, basically, to solidly accept how ""fucked"" everything is, in that dark humor dickish way, and then see what to do from there (again, an approach I have some sympathy for). Yet it's also just wrong.For example: ""no one, no matter how much you love them or they love you, will ever absolve that internal guilt you feel simply for existing. it's all fucked. everything is fucked. it always has been and always will be. there are no solutions, only stopgap measures, only incremental improvements, only slightly better forms of fuckedness than others""Really now? He clearly hasn't read The Finders. This ""restless discontentment with life"" can go away and be replaced by ""inner peace and acceptance of life"". After a long tirade about how there is no meaning in life (and everything we do is insignificant, ""The Uncomfortable Truth""), and any morals we choose are ultimately Subjective as we need to subjectively choose them (ok, sure), Mark presents his favorite Kantian law as ""logically derived and therefore objective"", The Formula of Humanity:“Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.”The point is pretty nice (and subtle). There's clearly a human-centric bias that is, in my not so humble opinion, unwarranted. The Formula for Humanity clearly points to ""presence"" in ""the moment"" -- as musn't every moment then be treated as an ends itself? Thus this can lead to switching from ""discontentment with life"" to ""peace and appreciaton of life"", yet somehow Mark doesn't quite make this leap. Curiously ""Amor Fati"" (love of one's fate) in many ways also points in a similar direction.There's the claim that ""Honesty, Humility, and Bravery"" follow from this Formula for Humanity. But they don't exactly. The Formula instructs me to lavish the lies I tell, not to merely tell the lies to get something else: tell a fun lie and really get into the charcater!-sigh- Which leaves Mark trying to push his preferred Morals and Values via ""rational reasoning"" that doesn't hold. Not that I haven't done that myself :p Mark's clearly read a lot of philosophy and enjoys sharing what he learned with us, but the personal contributions fall short.Mark has a fetish for commitment and self-limitation. Which is also used to fling arbitrary critiques. Does learning a language in 3 months really not require commitment? I'd spend 8-12 hours a day if I wanted to do that. That's 'sacrifice', boi!(Rational) Self-Control is an illusion as the Feeling Brain has the wheel in the Consciousness Car, but the best advice is still to learn to trick and guide the Feeling Brain into doing ""the right things"" the Thinking Brain wants it to. Mark generally believes that we should do the right thing regardless of our feelings. Emotions are to be coaxed into support of doing the right thing, as without working with them, we won't be able to do the right thing (as our Thinking Brain isn't driving).I found myself a bit surprised in the start that Mark was talking up the Feeling Brain initially, as my impression was that he had moved to eschewing emotions (or ""fuck your feelings""). Which is ironic, as he's still pro ""factual honesty"". Nonetheless, he maintained his form later in the book.Probably the best chapter of the book is ""Newton's Laws of Emotion"" that discusses moral gaps, and value hirearchies, how ""our self-worth equals the sum of our emotions over time"", and ""that identity only changes when contradicted"". This chapter was interesting, cutely written, and had various good points. I wish the rest of the book kept up this pace.Unforutanely the next chapter is a sarcastic satire of ""how to start a religion"" and promise the fulfilment of all your dreams (-- ok, your dreams will be fulfilled with sufficient followers). And there's the argument that Religion means ""believe without sufficient reason"", but if Value is inherently ungrounded, then any belief in the Value of something is ill-founded. Thus to Value anything is to be faith-based, and thus religious! Value your family? That's an ""Interperonal Religion"".Value equality? That's an ""Ideological Religion"".Valu your eternal soul? Ok, that's a traditional ""Spiritual Religion"". Basically the realization of the non-derived nature of Value is utterly butchered.""Pain is the Universal Constant"" covers the hedonic treadmill. Yet, the hedonic set-point generally hovers around 7/10. Seven out of Ten. That's ""fine"", not ""pain"". I could just as well argue that this means ""Joy is the Universal Constant"". Mark talks about how as we strive for happiness and avoid any small pain, we become increasingly fragile and sensitive. There may be some truth to this :0The book ends on, surprisingly, a Singularitarian note: AI will dominate the world and do everything better than us. What's next? The religion of pleasing our AI Gods, in hopes they bless our lives. The discussion of Child, Adolescent, and Adult modes of life was interesting, to be fair. Child :- immediate Pain - Pleasure reactionsAdolescent :- seek transactional rules for Pain - PleasureAdult :- live according to Principles regardless of pain or pleasure (in particular instances)Basically, as one grows and matures, one acts according to a world-model of increasing abstraction or generalization :) The problem with ""Hope"" for good times in the future? Well, shucks, brother, that's transactional thinking! Like you can get guarantees there anyway: you can't, and thus you'll always have some restlessness. That's why the answer to ""Hope"" is to do your best now. Principles are good as you bet they'll likely lead to about as good a future as you can fight for. It's easier to feel good about your actions and choices if aligned with Principles (aka Virtue ethics over Consequentialism).In the end, there are many interesting points and insights, but lost in a muddled presentation full of pseudo-reasoning and the author's personal moralizing. Cuz, yes, you suck if you do things against the author's personal moral code."

Hope? Everything being f*cked? Life? People? Better call it “The Book of Random Thoughts”. What the author doesn’t understand is that a book needs a structure and a bigger idea, unless you call it a collection of essays and then I know what to expect. It’s just so random. My guess after reading his first book, which btw is much better, is that he’s taken a number of blog posts about things being f*cked and/or hope, put them together and pretended there’s some bigger point in it (other than making money). I don’t see that point! The stories and conclusions that follow don’t seem to be governed by cause and effect logic either. Blah blah blah. Don’t read it, stick to his blog."

47,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"I can feel that this book is going to be great. Imagine if you write out all your thoughts on a book and the whole world read it, this is how I feel while I am reading his books, Also I'd really love to talk to someone like Mark(same thoughts about life) on a daily basis! *After reading review*This book is great as I expected. The author's greatest gift is giving a new definition to something we already understand it in the opposite meaning. On Greatness:  ""My formula for greatness in a human being, is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it - all idealism is mendaxity in the face of what is necessary - but love it"" -Nietzche  On Hope:  ""This is our challenge, our calling: To act without hope. to not hope for better. To be better. In this moment and the next. And the next. And the next. Everything is fucked. And hope is both the cause and the effect of that fuckedness"" On Freedom:  ""You can become freer right now simply by choosing the limitations you want to impose on yourself. You can choose to wake up earlier each morning, to block your email until midafternoon each day, to delete social media apps from your phone. These limitations will free you because they will liberate your time, attention, and power of choice. They treat your consciousness as an end in itself.""  This book is a treasure, there are many things to learn, it's funny also, for example: ""If I worked at starbucks, instead of writing people's names on their coffee cup, I'd write the following: one day, you and everyone you love will die. And beyond a small group of people for an extremly brief period of time, little of what you say or do will ever matter. This is the Uncomfortable Truth of life. and everything you think or do is but an elaborate avoidance of it. We are inconsequential cosmic dust, bumping and milling about on a tiny blue speck. We imagine our own importance. We invent our purpose-we are nothing. Enjoy your fucking coffee. Lastly, as Mark said:  Don't hope for better. Just be better.  "
48,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54912691-bianca-a,Rating 1 out of 5,"Never understood how this author made it big - his books are everywhere on the shelves and people seem to be digging them. One quick look at his background and you can tell the kind of quality to expect from this type of literature before even cracking open the cover. Is it really all about the cover design and click-bait title that makes the modern reader so ready to pick this sort of thing up? Or is it convenience? The first impression I had of this book is that it's a clear rip-off of Steven Pinker's 'Enlightenment Now' which was a MUCH better read. There are innumerable more books out there that give the same message of reassurance through outlining the recent accomplishments behind the argument that the good outweighs the bad. Some call it hope inducing, some try to call it something else. At the end of the day all it's really trying to be is a means to diminish ignorance.Or perhaps you want example stories such as Pilecki's? Just go right ahead and open history books - they're full of heroes who stood against the odds and made the so-called 'impossible' happen for some virtuous cause. Making conclusions about human psychology is just an opinion. One that people have taken too literally in books such as this that pertain in no way to science. Throwing names of famous philosophers in is also a strategy to impress the gullible and ignorant. If you've got money and interest in books of this sort that you think might help you, why not just read Kant or Nietzsche straight? Or better yet, psychology? Anyway, that's my 2 cents about it, and if I could give it less than 1 star, I would."
49,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4461733-paperclippe,Rating 1 out of 5,"Welp. I was skeptical of this book from page one when the author made some off-handed remark about how things weren't as bad as they could be, making comparisons to WWII, but I said, You know, whatever, we're not like, rationing shit. Maybe that's what that means. I started to make side eyes when he blamed all mental illness on a crisis of hope instead of like, unbalanced chemicals in your brain, but then he said positive things about cognitive behavioral therapy and told the scathing, horrible story of how lobotomies were used to treat mental illness, and I thought, Well, maybe he meant the parts of mental illness we can control. But then he made a derisive comment about folks who need safe spaces in the same sentence as he made a disparaging comment about white genocide, and I was done. There are a lot of good ideas in here, a lot of truths from Kant and the like. But somehow the author manages to twist that all into some weird boomer nice guy mentality and draws conclusions that studies have proven recently just aren't true at all (participation trophies do not in fact make people more self-entitled and also who the fuck decided it was a good idea to give out those trophies in the first place, asshole? It wasn't the grade schoolers participating). So anyway, in terms of what's fucked, it's pretty much this book. And I don't mean that as a compliment."

And even though they're all supposed to somehow tie together and convey the same point, they don't!I suffered through the book, skipping pages here and there because I loved his first book and kept faith that it was ultimately going to pay off, but alas!I wouldn't recommend the book, only giving it 2 stars since there are some redeeming ideas here which do make profound sense.

53,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68985512-tmr,Rating 2 out of 5,"Note: A sequel to A Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck. So read that one first before you jump into this one, although they are both subjectively different. But to understand the writing, perhaps it would be wise to try the first one out. Sigh, where do I begin?I had high expectations for this novel considering the fact that I had highly enjoyed the previous novel therefore I was sure that this would be just as equally informative but with some witty dialogue interwoven. But boy was I wrong.The cover is not much to look at, but the title almost screams that there is something interesting to gain from reading this novel. Perhaps information, perhaps understanding ourselves more, giving more hope? All of these lessons were to be expected acknowledging the title itself. So I was definitely intrigued and curious to know what hid this time in this author's novel. The summary itself. The summary is interesting and quite straightforward in itself overall. It simply talks about where we have faults in terms of keeping hope in a certain situation and how we can fix it to gain hope back in our lives. So pretty straight there with the reader, nothing more to the summary. But still good enough to get a rating. But then, there's such a thing as fate and how it screws up everything just when you're having fun or enjoying it. That's exactly what happened when I had crossed the threshold to almost 100 pages being left.To point out exactly what happened, here are some answers below.Numero uno 1. The whole time there are only bits and pieces of his own advice and his own experience about losing hope and gaining back hope. But the rest of the time it's even worse than a college student's plagiarised paper, with so much information churned out in the form of internet facts thrown left and right. Nothing personal, only mere factual information. Numero dos 2. Two many historical facts piled in, that was one fact I kinda dislike about the first book too, but it's been some time, so.. Almost felt like I was reading a history book for my high school class. And I really didn't enjoy those, to be honest. Thank god, I'm out of that hellhole. Moving on..Final point, numero tres 3. He's mostly pointing out the faults of everyone who ever lost hope, criticising them, making fun of them in a way. And he's dragging the religion point a bit too far. Two things: You're supposed to in a way suggest what could be done to better oneself, give hope back rather than mock someone for a poor choice made at one point. And another thing is that everyone has a different reason to believe in their religion, to have that faith in something. Because as Mr Manson said, you have to give a fuck or have faith in something. So contradicting yourself in that one or two pages is really not such a grand idea. Overall, a shambles. Never would I have thought this novel would want me to throw it to the floor, stomp on it a few times and then hurl it out like goddamn Tarzan and yell...But miracles do happen. Until the next read,-J.B"

true freedom doesn't really exist because we all must sacrifice some autonomy for stability. no one, no matter how much you love them or they love you, will ever absolve that internal guilt you feel simply for existing. it's all fucked. everything is fucked. it always has been and always will be. there are no solutions, only stopgap measures, only incremental improvements, only slightly better forms of fuckedness than others. and it's time we stop running from that and, instead, embrace it.
expanding outward from his previous work, the subtle art of not giving a f*ck, mark manson's new one, everything is f*cked: a book about hope, focuses a little less on individuals and interpersonal relationships and a little more on the state of the world and our engagement with it. while manson does not offer any epiphanic insights, his ability to infuse his message with a no-bullshit approach and abundant dark humor allows it to resonant more than it otherwise would (he's certainly addressing an audience for whom such an approach works best). everything is f*cked isn't a mere chronicle or litany of worldly ills (for you'd surely need several tomes to do that!), but a dissection of what lies at their foundation: namely, you. and me. all of us, individually and collectively.if you're already a fan of manson's writing, you'll inevitably love everything is f*cked and his trademark mordant wit. unlike so much of the schlock that makes up the motivational genre, manson doesn't really offer a recipe for fixing yourself (let alone the world around you), but instead tries to offer perspective, reflection, and lessons from minds greater than his own. in sum, he just wants you to be a better person... which, if enough people strove to actually do so, a better world likely come around on its own.throughout the rich and developed world, we are not living through a crisis of wealth or material, but a crisis of character, a crisis of virtue, a crisis of means and ends. the fundamental political schism in the twenty-first century is no longer right versus left, but the impulsive childish values of the right and left versus the compromising adolescent/adult values of both the right and left. it's no longer a debate of communism versus capitalism or freedom versus equality but, rather, of maturity versus immaturity, of means versus ends."

This book was less about psychological studies and more about interesting philosophies and ideas. Manson grabbed a bunch from Nietzsche and Plato. He also dug into their life and who they really were which was interesting.It had interesting idea's about the world and where we've come and where we're going. Artificial intelligence is an exciting yet scary thing. You can easily create your own religion because they're basically all the same.Instead of flying cars we got twitter. lololol It's because what we think we really want is sometimes not actually what we really want, there's other things that are important that we didn't realize.There's the left side and right side of your brain, for feelings and emotions and the other for logic and reason. They both have to live in harmony with each other, you can't ignore your feelings.Don't strive for happiness, strive for pain and suffering and you'll be happier. This food for thought was kinda like - expect the worst so that you'll never be disappointed.Talked a lot about how it's human to have hope and faith but having hope is always wishing for something greater, and you will never be fulfilled.

I actually really like Mark Manson’s writing but this is not his best work to say this least. I recommended ""The Subtle Art"" to so many of my coworkers, because we wanted to believe that this miserable job won't define our careers. We all really hated that job. But anyway, let’s start with the audiobook which is my favourite way to consume nonfiction. The narration for this book was not good, which is a surprise because the author narrated it himself. Usually, authors narrating their own books are great but for some reason, Manson was robotic, failing to emphasise on his own points and there were many instances where the punchlines to his own jokes were delivered badly. Trudging through 4 hours of this, I switched to the physical book and honestly it wasn’t much better.The whole point of this book was lost on me because there was no visible link between the chapters and the idea of hope seemed to get lost in all the other things he chose to talk about. While reading/listening to this, I kept wondering to myself “Mark, what the fuck are you actually on about?” It’s a Mark Manson book, a certain level of profanity is allowed. I was expecting it be more like his first book where he based it on his experience. This one seems like drawing from an accumulation of surface-level knowledge, and sometimes stretching it too far to make it fit with the theme. I was expecting the second half of the book to talk about the lack of hope, and how to live without it as was specified- what I got were entire chapters on moral philosophy. We had Nietzsche, Kant and Plato. Now I don’t mind philosophies being used or referred to, but if I wanted to read philosophy, I would read a philosophy book. There are people who have written about it, and done it better than Manson. This also makes me think that the marketing for this book was misguided. I think Manson’s first book took off because it was better but also because the idea of ""sweary"" books was somewhat new. Now that the novelty has worn off, the excessive use of profanity was not appealing. Not to mention that Manson is being condescending in this writing, instead of being quirky. I've never used the word ""mansplaining"" but I believe it applies perfectly in this scenario. Needless to say, quite the disappointment. Mark, go sit in the corner and think about what you’ve done."

This one is nothing ground breaking, but it was the fluffy easy read I needed amidst darker reads. And, I actually found it kind of encouraging/cheering. Yet totally cheesy. “Because pain is the universal constant of life, the opportunities to grow from that pain are constant in life. All that is required is that we don't numb it, that we don't look away. All that is required is that we engage it and find the value and meaning in it.” “Freedom itself demands discomfort.”“The only true form of freedom, the only ethical form of freedom, is through self-limitation.

That Manson pulls it off is a testament to the clarity of this thinking on weighty topics of what it means to be human and how we can best navigate the world in which humans have to interact with each other. Read it for the discussion of the Feeling Brain / Thinking Brain debate (Kahneman et alia), for the fascinating observations about AI (it has already won.

“...Tom Waits 1970’lerin çoğunu gözünü açık tutmaya ve sigaralarını nerede bıraktığını hatırlamaya çalışan bir alkolik olarak geçirdi. Ayrıca bu süreçte yedi tane çok parlak albüm yapacak zamanı da buldu. Çok üretken ve derindi; ödüller kazandı ve tüm dünyanın beğendiği milyonlarca albümü satıldı. İnsanlık konusundaki içgörüsü çok çarpıcı olan ender bulunur bir sanatçıydı. Waits’in lobotomi konusundaki sözleri bizi güldürse de içinde bilgelik saklıdır: Hiç tutkusu olmayacağına dolu bir şişeyle tutku sorunları yaşamayı yeğler; hiç umut edememektense berbat yerlerde umut aramak daha iyidir; güdülerimiz olmadan bizler birer hiçiz...”“...İyi bir insan olmanın tek yolu, düşünen beynin hisseden beyne baskın olması, aklın duygulardan, görev duygusunun arzulardan önemli olmasıdır. İnsanlık tarihinin çoğunda insanlar kaba, batıl inançlı ve eğitimsizdiler. Ortaçağlarda spor olsun diye kedilere işkence eder ve çocuklarını kasaba meydanında bir hırsızın hayalarının kesilişini izlemeye götürürlerdi. İnsanlar sadist, içgüdüsel boklardır. Tarihin çoğunda dünya yaşaması hoş bir yer değildi; bunun nedeni de herkesin hisseden beyninin amok koşusunda olmasıydı. Medeniyetle tam anarşi arasında duran tek şey klasik varsayımdı. Sonra bir sonraki asırda bir şeyler oldu. İnsanlar trenler, arabalar, merkezi ısıtma sistemi ve başka şeyler icat ettiler. Ekonomik zenginlik insanın güdülerinin önüne geçti. İnsanlar artık yiyecek bulamamak ya da krala hakaret ettikleri için öldürülmek gibi şeyler için endişelenmemeye başladılar. Hayat daha konforlu ve kolaydı. Daha önce akıllarına bile gelmemiş olan her türden varoluşsal boklar hakkında oturup düşünecek zamanları vardı artık...”“...Çünkü duygularını kontrol edemezsin, düşünen beyin; kendini kontrol etmek bir illüzyondur. Her iki beyin hizalı olduğunda ve aynı eylem planını izlediklerinde meydana gelen bir illüzyondur. İnsanlara umut vermek için tasarlanmış bir illüzyondur. Düşünen beyinle hisseden beyin hizada olmadıklarında insanlar kendilerini güçsüz hissederler. Bu illüzyonu daima sürdürebilmenin yolu sürekli beyinlerinle iletişim halinde olman ve aynı değerlerin çevresinde hizalanmalarını sağlamandır. Bu, su topu oynamak veya bıçakla gösteri yapmak gibi bir beceridir ve çaba gerektirir. Bu yolda başarısızlıklar da olacaktır. Kolunu kesebilir ve her yeri kan içinde bırakabilirsin. Bu giriş ücretidir. Ama şu senin elindedir, düşünen beyin: Kendini kontrol edemezsin, ama anlamt kontrol edebilirsin. Senin süper gücün budur. Bu, armağanındır. Güdülerinin ve duygularının anlamını kontrol edebilirsin. Ne kadar uygun görünseler de onları deşifre etmen gerekir. Ve bu inanılmaz derecede güçlüdür, çünkü duygularımıza verdiğimiz anlamdır ve genellikle hisseden beynin duygularımıza verdiği anlamı değiştirir...”“...Istırap ahlaki boşluklar oluşturur.

Evinizi su basarsa üzülür, Tanrı’ya, evrene, hayatın kendisine küsersiniz. Bunlar ahlaki boşluklardır. Yanlış bir şey olduğu duygusudur ve siz (ya da bir başkası) yeniden bütün olmayı hak ediyorsunuzdur. Nerede ıstırap varsa illa ki içten gelen bir üstün- lük/alçaklık duygusu vardır. Ve her zaman ıstırap vardır. Ahlaki boşluklarla karşılaştığımız zaman eşitleme yönünde baskın duygular geliştiririz; bir ahlaki eşitlik peşine düşeriz. Bu eşitlik arzusu bir hak etme formunu alır. Size yumruk attığım için yumruk atılmayı ya da bir şekilde cezalandırılmayı hak ettiğimi hissedersiniz. Bu duygu (ya da benim hak eden acım) sizde benim hakkımda güçlü duygular oluşmasına neden olur (en muhtemeli öfke). Ayrıca yumruk yemeyi hak etmediğiniz, yanlış bir şey yapmadığınız ve hem benim hem de çevrenizdeki herkesin size daha iyi davranmasını hak ettiğiniz çerçevesinde güçlü duygulara sahipsinizdir. Bu duygular üzüntü, kendine acıma ya da kafa karışıklığı şeklini alabilir. Tüm bu bir şeyi “hak etme”, ahlaki boşluğun karşısında yaptığımız bir değer yargısıdır. Bir şeyin bir diğerinden daha iyi olduğuna karar veririz; biri diğerinden daha haklıdır; bir olay bir diğerinden daha az arzulanır. Ahlaki boşluklar değerlerimizin doğduğu yerdir...”“...Koşulsuz davranmak zordur. Birini onun da sizi seveceğinden emin olamadan seversiniz, ama yine de seversiniz. Canınızın yanacağını bile bile birine güvenirsiniz. Çünkü koşul- suzluk belli bir dereceye kadar inanç gerektirir; daha fazla acıya neden olsa da, siz ya da karşınızdaki açısından işe yaramasa da inanç buradaki doğru şeydir...”“...Yetişkin davranışları son safhada hayranlık uyandırıcı ve değerli olmalıdır. Çalışanlarının hataları nedeniyle düşüşü üzerine alan patron; çocuklarınınki için kendi mutluluğundan vazgeçen anne; sizi üzecek olsa bile duymanız gerekeni söyleyen dost. Bu insanlar dünyayı bir arada tutarlar. Onlar olmasaydı gerçekten boku yemiştik...”“...Mutluluk için değiş-tokuşa girişirseniz mutluluğu yok edersiniz. Özgürlüğü dayatırsanız onu inkâr edersiniz. Eşitlik yaratmaya uğraşırsanız eşitliğin altına mayın döşersiniz. Bu ideolojik dinlerin hiçbiri eldeki ana konuyla uğraşmamışlardır: koşulsuzluk. Bundan söz etmezler ya da Tanrı değeriniz neyse bir noktada ona yaklaşmak için insan hayatını pazarlık konusu yapacağınızı itiraf etmezler. Doğaüstü bir tanrıya, soyut bir prensibe, dipsiz bir arzuya ibadet ederseniz ve bunu yeterince uzun yaparsanız bu ibadetin amaçları uğruna ya kendi insanlığınızdan ya da başkalarınınkinden vazgeçersiniz. Ve sizi ıstıraptan kurtarması beklenen şey bu kez gerisin geri ıstırap içinde bırakır. Umut-yıkım döngüsü yenilenir. Ve Kant burada işin içine girer...Hayatın Tek KuralıHayatının erken döneminde Kant huzursuzluk veren hakikat karşısında umudu korumak için oynanan oyunları anlamıştı. Ve zalim kozmik oyunun farkına varan herkes gibi umutsuzluğa kapıldı. Ama oyunu kabul etmedi. Varoluşa kendiliğinden bir değer olmadığına inanmayı reddetti. Yaşamlarımıza rastlantısal bir anlam vermek için ebediyen hikâyeler uydurmak zorunda olduğumuza inanmayı reddetti. O çok kaslı düşünen beynini umutsuz bir değerin nasıl olacağını anlamak için işe koştu.Kant basit bir gözlemle işe başladı. Tüm evrende gerçekten kıt ve özgün olan tek bir şey vardı: bilinç. Bizi tüm evrenden ayıran şey mantık yürütme becerimizdi - çevremizdeki dünyayı alıp mantık yürütme aracılığıyla onu iyileştirebilirdik. Bu onun için özel, son derece özeldi ve neredeyse bir mucizeydi, çünkü varlığın sonsuz yelpazesinde (bildiğimiz kadarıyla) bir tek bizler varlığı yönlendirebilirdik. Bilinen evrende bir tek bizler özgünlüğün ve yaratıcılığın özgün kaynaklarıydık. Bir tek bizler kaderimizi yönlendirebilirdik. Kendinin farkında olan bir tek bizler vardık. Ve bildiğimiz kadarıyla evrende akıllı bir kendini düzenleme mekanizmasına sadece bizler sahiptik.Kant akıllı bir şekilde, mantıksal olarak evrendeki en üstün değerin kendinden değer çıkartabilen ��ey olduğu sonucuna vardı. Varoluşun tek hakiki anlamı anlam oluşturabilme becerisiydi. Tek önemli şey öneme karar verebilen şeydi.Ve bu anlamı seçebilme yetisi, önemi hayal edebilme, amaç uydurabilme bilinen evrende kendini yayabilen tek güçtü; aklını yayabilir ve giderek artan seviyelerde organizasyonu evren içinde yaratabilirdi. Kant mantık olmazsa evrenin ziyan olacağını, boş ve amaçsız hale geleceğini düşünüyordu. Akıl ve bu aklı uygulayacak özgürlük olmadan bizler birer kayadan farksızdık. Kayalar değişmez. Değerleri, sistemleri ve organizasyonları yoktur. Farklılaşmazlar, iyiye gitmezler ya da yaratmazlar. Sadece oradadırlar.Ama bilinç - bilinç evreni yeniden düzenleyebilir ve organizasyon artarak kendi üzerine eklenir. Bilinç bir sorunu, belirli miktarda karmaşık bir sistemi ele alarak daha büyük bir karmaşa yaratabilir. Bin yılda küçük bir mağarada oturmaktan milyarların aklını birbirine eklemleyen dijital hükümranlıklar inşa ettik. Başka bir bin yılda rahatça yıldızların arasında olabilir, gezegenlere ve alan/zamanın kendisine yeniden şekil verebiliriz. Şeylerin büyük şemasında her bireysel eylemin anlamı olmayabilir, ama mantıklı bilincin korunması ve promosyonu her şeyden önemlidir.Kant’a kalırsa en temel ahlaki görevimiz hem kendimizdeki hem de başkalarındaki bilincin korunması ve büyümesiydi. Her zaman bilinci en öne geçiren bu prensibine “İnsanlık Formülü” adını verdi ve bir şekilde... yani; her şeyi her zaman açıklıyordu. Temel ahlaki kurulularımızı açıklıyordu. Klasik erdem kavramını açıklıyordu. Gündelik yaşamlarımızda hayali bir umut vizyonuna takılmadan nasıl davranacağımızı açıklıyordu. Nasıl boktan biri olunmayacağını açıklıyordu. Bu yeterli değilmiş gibi her şeyi tek bir cümlede açıklıyordu. İnsanlık Formülü şöyle der: “İnsanlığı, kendinde ve başkalarında hiçbir zaman sırf bir araç olarak değil, aynı zamanda hep bir amaç olarak görecek gibi eyle.” Bu kadar. İnsanlık Formülü insanları ergen pazarlıkçılığından yetişkin erdemine yönlendiren biricik ilkedir...”“...Modern demokrasi ortalama insanın bencil ve hayalperest olduğu varsayımıyla icat edilmiştir ve bizi kendimizden korumanın tek yolu birbirine kilitli ve bağımlı bir sistem yaratarak bir kişinin ya da grubun nüfusun geri kalanını ağır bir yenilgiye uğratmasıdır...”“...En tehlikeli aşırılık yanlıları çocuksu değerlerini pazarlık diline ya da evrensel prensiplere tercüme edebilenlerdir. Sağcı bir aşırılık yanlısı her şeyden çok “özgürlük” istediğini ve bunun için fedakârlık yapmaya hazır olduğunu söyler. Ama asıl istediği kendi haritasında yer almayan değerlerle uğraşmak için özgürlüktür. Başka insanları marjinalleştirmek ya da değiştirmek için özgürlük ister. Kendi özgürlüğü adına başkalarınınkini kısıtlamaya ya da yok etmeye isteklidir.Sol aşırı uç da aynı oyunu oynar, sadece dil farklıdır. Solcu bir aşırılık yanlısı herkes için “eşitlik” istediğini söyler, ama asıl söylediği kimsenin acı çekmesini, zarar görmesini ya da kendini aşağıda hissetmesini istemediğidir. Kimsenin ahlaki boşlukla karşılaşmasını istemez. Bu ahlaki boşlukları ortadan kaldırmak amacıyla başkalarına acı vermeye ve rakip olmaya hazırdır.Sağda da solda da aşırılık son birkaç on yılda tüm dünyada politik olarak öne geçti. Birçok akıllı insan bu konuda bir sürü karmaşık ve üst üste binen açıklama yaptılar. Ve muhtemelen de bir sürü karmaşık ve üst üste binen neden vardır...”“...Çünkü ıstıraptan kurtulamazsınız; ıstırap insanlık koşulunun evrensel sabitidir. Bu nedenle ıstıraptan kurtulma girişimi, insanın kendini tüm zararlardan koruması sadece geri tepebilir. Istıraptan kurtulmaya çalışmak sadece ıstıraba olan duyarlılığınızı artırır, ıstırabınızı hafifletmez. Her yerde tehlikeli hayaletler görmeye, her otoritede zulüm ve baskı sezmeye, her sarılışın ardında nefret ve hayal kırıklığı aramaya başlarsınız...”“...İyi yaşamak ıstıraptan kaçınmak demek değildir; doğru nedenlerle ıstırap çekmek demektir. Eğer sadece var olduğumuz için ıstırap çekmeye zorlanacaksak iyi bir şekilde ıstırap çekmeyi de öğrenebiliriz...”“...İşler ne kadar boka sararsa insanlar o kadar bok yemeyi isterler. Sağlıklı bir aşk ilişkisi anti-kırılgandır: Talihsizlikler ve ıstıraplar ilişkiyi zayıflatacağına güçlendirir. Gaziler sık sık savaş kaosunun askerler arasında hayatlarını değiştiren ilişkiler kurup güçlendirmesinden söz ederler; bu kaos bu bağların çözülmesine neden olmaz...”“...Ama eskilerin bildiğini unutmuş görünüyoruz: Dünyada ne kadar zenginlik olursa olsun hayatlarımızın kalitesini karakterimizin kalitesi belirler ve karakterimizin kalitesini belirleyen de acımızla olan ilişkimizdir.Mutluluğun peşinde koşmak bizi dosdoğru nihilizm ve uçarılığa götürür. Çocuklaşırız ve toleranssız, bitmez bir şekilde daha fazlasını arzularız; bu, doldurulamaz bir boşluk, dindirilemez bir susuzluktur. Yozlaşma ve bağımlılığın, kendine acıma ve kendini yıkıma uğratmanın kökenidir.Acıyı izlediğimiz zaman acının hayatımıza getireceğini seçebiliriz. Ve bu seçim acıyı anlamlı kılar, böylelikle hayatı anlamlı kılar.Çünkü ıstırap hayatın evrensel değişmeziyse bu ıstırap sayesinde gelişmek de hayatın değişmezidir. Tek gerekli olan başka yöne bakmamamızdır. Ona angaje olmamız ve onda anlam ve değer bulmamızdır.Istırap tüm değerlerin kaynağıdır. Kendi acımızı uyuşturmamız bu dünyada anlamı olan her şeyi uyuşturmaktır. Acı zamanla en derin değerlerimiz ve inançlarımız olacak ahlaki boşlukları açar.Bir amaç uğruna acı çekmeyi inkâr edersek hayatlarımızda bir amaç olmasını da inkâr etmiş oluruz...”“...Demokrasi olgunluk seviyesi yüksek ve karakteri sağlam vatandaşlarla mümkündür...”“...Eski tanrıların yerine yenileri geçecek: algoritmalar.

I really enjoyed Mark Manson's previous book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*uck. It was fun and fresh, he talked about his personal experience, choosing better things to give a fuck about, and it was overall a good time. This book was definitely not a good time. It was just a lot of wannabe-philosophical babbling that lacked cohesion and a clear message. There were a couple of passages that were almost interesting but I didn't find enough meaningful takeaways in the book to make sitting through all the noise worth it. (I listened to the audiobook, narrated by the author in a pretty disengaged manner, which didn't help either.) If you're intrigued by his books, read The Subtle Art and feel free to skip this one.

Виторговувати в батька любов, у друзів — підтримку, у начальника — повагу якось навіть і не хочеться. Купувати любов і повагу бридко. Бо тоді все трісне по швах. Якщо когось доводиться переконувати любити вас, значить, та людина вас не любить. Якщо когось треба підкуповувати, щоб він вас поважав, значить, справжньої поваги від нього ви не дочекаєтеся. Якщо когось ви мусите улещувати, аби він вам довіряв, довіри так ніколи не й буде.Найчудовіші й найважливіші речі в житті — за визначенням купити й дістати неможливо.

Omitting this chapter would have made this book slightly better. There were one or two good points the greatest I feel was, avoiding painful things will not help you but rather make you more fragile in the long run.

Because a lot of people who would otherwise never have heard about these intellectuals can know about them in a millennial friendly language .Talking specifically about this book I would say I liked it pretty much until the last chapter which was a big letdown for me . It read more as a elaborate conspiracy theory against AI, the like of which you usually find on Reddit and I thought he was being too paranoid and preachy there .For the rest of the chapters he derived much of his ideas from the Buddhist philosophy and works of the philosphers like Neitzsche and Kant and Plato .His insights on behaviour economics were clearly borrowed from Daniel kahneman and Taleb (which isn't a bad thing like I mentioned before ) so the content of the book will look very intellectual and academic if you arnt familiar with the work of the aforementioned writers On the contrary if you have read these authors, this book I'm afraid won't add much to your knowledge base ."

Many of his themes are common and very old. HIs conversational style at times can raise a smile or snicker. His theories are intellectually consistent, to the extent I understand them. His view of humanity is very low, though supportable by history and facts. This is a good book to inspire meaningful thought and reflection and one's own thinking and actions.Ethics, morality and doing the right thing for the right reason will always merit at least four stars."

The rest was just like trying to explain what is hope, and how to remain the strength of the hope to come true. The concept of you wish for something, hoping that you will get it, but at the same time, you have to work for it, ensuring that you have an endless effort to achieve it. But if you didn't get what you hope for, you have to accept the situation, and keep on hoping. The idea of making people to realize that there's always hope for you, no matter what.Arghh!!! Forgive me, I just didn't like it. Mark Manson left a very high benchmark on The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck and I am going to remain my brain in that strength of hope but, not this latest book. It's more like reading a common thesis or research for a psychology study and behavior research. Maybe the gist in it is good, but not the elaboration."

This book is basically about hope in the sense that if one cut down negative ie.diversions (transactional or merely about pursuing pleasure like hedonist and numbing pain) influences and goals from our life and start pursuing true and better goals & dreams which are full of honest experiences of pain and failures which make us more antifragile more of a human, then there is a lesser need of hope. This make us find and give meaning to true freedom. Surely life isn't easy as many of us thinks.The book is very knowledgeable and is more kind of complied blog and article.

105,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59371159-ilana,Rating 2 out of 5,"This was a timely book for me. I’m on a lifelong path of recovery from complex PTSD from sustained childhood trauma, combined with Bipolar and anxiety disorders... and whatever other labels they invent next to explain my type of brain chemistry, neurological organization and unique life path. These are majorly fucked up times for humanity at large. Extremism is now the norm at both ends of the political spectrum. Truth is dead. WrongThink is back in 2084, this age of Wokeness and Transhumanism. Voices are daily muzzled & supressed. News organization, politicians, scientists, “influencers” of all stripes worldwide are all in the pocket of global corporations. Everyone is experiencing anxiety & depression at unprecedented levels. And as if completely by accident... these times are especially challenging for those afflicted by mental health issues to try to recover a measure of sanity and composure. Mark Mason seemed to offer what I was in need of: a short but convincing argument for countering our modern day disaffection. A way back to hope in the age of cynicism. With the advent of science, humanity was able to solve many of the problems that made life a punishing business; filthy, disease-ridden and rather short. Technological advances have brought us countless convenient solutions to everyday problems and has consequently left us with more time to fill up with distractions. Marketing came in to advance economic pursuits and used Freud’s findings that we are motivated by feelings rather than rationality. And of course, this is true, no matter our mastery of stoicism. Advertising has become a ubiquitous part of living, and it operates by appealing to our emotions and making us feel we are incomplete without the next New & Improved thing. This feeling of incompleteness is brought home without pause when we’re constantly bombarded by messages promising us we could so much happier, with this or that thing or service or game, snack or movie. All of which is exacerbated because we’re more isolated and lonely than ever before, with the erosion of families and communities. Little surprise we are more depressed and dissatisfied with life though living conditions have become so much more comfortable. Taking ideas from various philosophies, with a strong emphasis on Nietzsche & Buddhism, Mason argues that the pursuit of happiness is a leading cause of our dissatisfaction. When we get what we want, we immediately want the next thing. When one dream comes true, we’re left dealing with the new reality and its built-in problems and dreaming up new possibilities for a new boost of happiness. It’s an endless frustrating cycle which capitalism thrives on. Mason calls all belief systems and ideologies “religions” the same way Yuval Noah Harari does. We adopt ideas and treat them as being extensions of our selves and create communities with others sharing similar ideas, demonizing those who have different notions which don’t match our own. All religious systems are based on a promise of something better: they bring us hope of a better tomorrow or afterlife. All religions must also create a common enemy to help strengthen adherence. All religion require blind faith, in turn ensuring individuals are compliant and willing to sacrifice themselves for “the greater cause”. Sports are a religion. Food is a religion. Video games are a religion. The notion of identity... same. Children learn early that what is painful is bad, and what feels nice is good. As we grow older, those who gain in maturity and become adults (as opposed to overgrown children or teens) understand that life can’t be based on seeking feel-good moments and all-you-can eat ice cream, and that sacrifices must be made to attain meaningful rewards. To have a committed, nurturing relationship, one can’t also have an exciting dating life. To have a successful career, one must put in all the time and effort which inevitably is taken away from other pursuits. And so on. We’ve been sold the idea that “fun” is the most important value. But those who’ve reformed from a life of hard partying often say (as I do) they’ve found much more satisfaction from a quiet life of contemplation. This is where the idea of meditation comes in. Most people hate meditation because, let’s be real, it’s a crashing bore. There is no way to be good at meditation, there are no levels or awards or power ups or extra lives, and instead, it involves sitting quietly with the mess of ideas, memories, and feelings our minds throw at us. There is never a material result or any way to measure progress. What it is instead, is an exercise in resilience. An exercise, as Mason puts in, in anti-fragility. As someone who’s been terrible at sustaining a meditation practice, I wholeheartedly agree. What meditation teaches is, how to sit with discomfort. Essentially, how to endure pain. Because as humans, we all suffer one way or another, so learning how to endure unease is a skill worth pursuing. When we are depressed or angry, it is a sign we have lost hope. We need hope to sustain us, and give us the will to reach out beyond ourselves. We need the illusion of a better tomorrow to distract us from our mortality. To distract us from the insignificance of our lives and its accomplishments or lack thereof. Hope is useful, but it is also a source of pain, because our hopes are all too often dashed. Mason doesn’t offer answers, but calls on us to reflect on what is of greatest value and where our energies are best put to use. What pain we’re willing to endure to make life bearable, knowing humans are deeply flawed and forever dissatisfied beings. True freedom isn’t an absence of pain and a endless number of agreeable options, but rather the option to choose the pain we are most willing to live with. His example is the polio vaccine: the momentary pain of needle prick replacing the pain of a horrible lingering disease. Or the pain of long work hours building a career as opposed to the pain and worry of financial distress. Well, maybe that’s not the best example. Moving on. We living in Westernized countries have a problem of plentitude. Too many options do not make for happiness—they lead to greater dissatisfaction as we constantly questions our choices and wonder what we might be missing out on. What we need is to learn to restrict our options and make sacrifices which in turn yield rewards and happiness. The sacrifice and discomfort of a regular exercise routine to be more vigorous and fit and with perseverance, even toned. The sacrifice of giving up mindless tv shows, movies, games & social media (ha!) for the greater reward of the pursuit of knowledge.I loved this book. I loved how simple and straightforward his delivery was, and how Mason organized his material. I thought: this is one of the best books I’ve read this year, this is great, I need to actually read Nietzsche now, been putting if off for decades, I can relate to Nietzsche’s frame of mind. Then, the last chapter. This is where disaster struck. Mason, like so many men (it definitely seems to be a male obsession) is completely in love with the idea of artificial intelligence, aka AI. He goes on at length to explain how incredibly rapid the advances in AI have been, surprising even its biggest proponents and investors such as Elon Musk and Bill Gates. AI is now so advanced is has outsmarted the most intelligent humans. It has invented languages we can’t begin to decipher. It can teach itself complicated games of strategy within a few hours and beat the most sophisticated human minds. Soon we’ll be listening to music and watching movies and entertainment all conceived by virtual intelligence. We’re already partly there. According to Manson and all who are deeply vested with AI, soon AI will develop its own AI machines and they will become our masters. AI will fix our shortcomings and inherent flaws as mere biological beings and provide the ultimate algorithms for improving our lives. As he says, science, which essentially killed god, will have been the tool through which humanity will have created its new gods. And like gods, the machines will be unknowable, all-seeing and mysterious. And humans in turn will instinctually make sacrifices and create new rituals to celebrate and appease the new gods of Artificial Intelligence. In short, AI is the new religion. Its adherents live in hope humanity will somehow meld with machine and we’ll all happily swim in a pool of universal consciousness in a microscopic chip somewhere while exploring the galaxies with our immortal combined souls. Or some shit like that. So: don’t hope we can fix our own problems as a species on this planet we’re destroying with glee, since there’s probably lots of other great planets out there anyway. Our destiny lies in following the new religion of AI (sometimes known as Transhumanism), and trust the new gods of AI will make everything better for us, because they’ll be so all-knowing they’ll guide us along a more desirable path, away from our messy and unsatisfying mortality. The answer isn’t greater agency, but less. I was waiting for Mason to cackle and say, I’m just pulling your leg guys. But no. He believes, like all followers of this particular cult , this is the most logical way to evolve to our perfect algorithmic iteration.. Well, Fuck that shit.I’m... not a big believer. In anything. I certainly don’t believe it’s a good idea to create machines that outsmart us to the point where they render our bags of flesh and bones obsolete. I like nature. Most humans find sanity and wellbeing in nature. Many of us find great beauty and inspiration in nature. Many of us prefer the company of animals over other insufferable humans and their mixed up ideas and annoying egos. Personally, animals are a reason for not stepping off this mad ride a few stops early. If I believe in anything, it’s that nature is more intelligent than mankind seems to be willing to accept. I don’t like the idea that we must “conquer” nature. Conquering means taking what doesn’t belong to us. We are raping nature because it’s too inconvenient to ask permission or make a long-term commitment to. I think creating new gods is asking for trouble. I think the lack of humility of men who think they can improve on nature is beyond idiotic: it’s criminal and well, evil as fuck. But that’s me. And I’m just a nobody. So... whatever.Would’ve been 5 a stars read, by I’m so spooked by the idea that he’s made this whole case to sell us on this better and improved religion which is geared towards rendering nature obsolete... Well—hell, no."

He advises, ""To build and maintain hope, we need three things: a sense of control, belief in the value of something, and community,"" even if that means deconstructing a few ""value-laden narratives"" along the way. This contrary, original, and quirky self-help best seller is entertaining, informative, and thought provoking. I gave it five stars because it's a pretty good read. The author is a big fan of Plato, Nietzsche, and Hume, but clearly he's a twenty-first century writer, as his farfetched yet uncannily believable conclusion demonstrates. The book is well organized. Step by step, the author describes his theory of human consciousness evolving in a world in which everything is fucked. By the time he reveals the outcome he expects, it seems far less improbable than it might have seemed before being systematically foreshadowed in earlier chapters."

Manson’s work begins with an analysis of human psychology and it’s inherent limitations, of which there are many. In fact, we simply cannot trust ourselves to make good decisions. Manson’s work intersects various ideas which make for an interesting train of thought, but may be difficult to follow. Stoicism, Nihilism, AI, Newton, Einstein, Antifragility, and you. Key insights: 1.) Humanity is a biased, self-serving, irrational entity which demands validation over fulfillment, and emotional satisfaction over rational decision making. 2.) It is this inherent fact which characterizes humanity, and that instead of fighting our human nature. We should work with it and move forward. 3.) Hope is fucked. Hope can be created, manufactured, sold and is almost indestructible. Don’t play for feeling good about yourself, play to win. 4.) Pain is ever present. Freedom isn’t what you can experience, it’s what you can limit yourself to. TLDR: “I found a resource that made all the difference, I learned how to think.” - Edward Thorp"

126,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58259892-charlotte,No Rating,"2020 POPSUGAR CHALLENGE25. A book with only words on the cover, no images or graphicsIk had hoge verwachtingen voordat ik aan dit boek begon. Ik had zijn eerste boek met heel veel plezier gelezen en hoopte dat ik net zo euforisch over dit boek zou zijn. Zeker in het begin viel dat enorm tegen. Ik kwam niet door het eerste gedeelte heen (""wat een filosofisch geleuter""). M'n gedachten dwaalden continu af tijdens het lezen en het werd daardoor eerder een 'moetje' dan dat ik er plezier in had. Wél was ik vanaf het begin af aan enthousiast over de humor van Manson. Het is zo tof als je goede humor kan introduceren in een non-fictie boek.Toen ik 'm weer oppakte na een pauze, was ik razend enthousiast over de laatste paar hoofdstukken. Ik herkende bepaalde stukken voor mijn eigen situatie en was daardoor soms zelfs opgelucht, om bevestiging te krijgen dat er verklaringen zijn voor hoe je je soms voelt of hoe je denkt. Wat interessante voorbeelden en quotes:- De menselijkheidsformule stelt: 'Wees menselijk in je handelen, tegenover jezelf of tegenover de ander, en altijd als het doel, nooit als middel.' (pagina 172)- Pijn is de de universele constante. Die constante pijn resulteert in wat de 'hedonistische loopband' wordt genoemd, waarop je je benen uit je lijf rent om de denkbeeldige tien te bereiken. Maar wat er ook gebeurt, je komt altijd weer uit op zeven. Die pijn is er altijd. Het enige wat er verandert is je waarneming. Zodra je het iets beter krijgt, verschuiven je verwachtingen mee en ben je weer licht ontevreden. (pagina 190)- Het najagen van geluk leidt onherroepelijk tot nihilisme en lichtzinnigheid. (...) Als we daarentegen pijn niet uit de weg gaan en zelfs opzoeken, hebben we een keuze in welke pijn we in ons leven toelaten. Die keuze geeft betekenis aan onze pijn en daarmee ook betekenis aan ons leven. (pagina 210)- De paradox van de keuzevrijheid. Hoe meer opties we krijgen, hoe minder tevreden we zijn met de optie die we uiteindelijk kiezen. (...) De enige echte vorm van vrijheid, de enige ethische vorm van vrijheid, verkrijg je door zelfbeperking. Het is niet zozeer het voorrecht om te kiezen voor alles wat je maar wilt, maar juist om te kiezen wat je wilt opgeven. (...) Jezelf dingen ontzeggen is tegenstrijdig genoeg het enige waardoor je meer vrijheid in je leven krijgt. (pagina 227-228)- We hebben het nodig dat ons leven zin heeft, en hoewel de verbluffende opmars van de technologie het moeilijker heeft gemaakt om betekenis in ons leven te vinden, komt de grootste innovatie op de dag dat we inhoud aan ons leven kunnen geven zonder strijd of conflict, en de dood geen voorwaarde meer is om de waarde van het leven in te zien.

I also didn't like the part with the AI and robots taking over and extinguishing us. However, the first part where Manson explained how hopelessness is at the core of all our misery, of all mental health issues, helped me understand some, or better said, realize how true it was. It was also nice that it made me chuckle a few times. And I also jotted down some quotes I want to come back to later.""The opposite of happiness is hopelessness, an endless horizon of resignation and indifference. Is the belief that everything is fucked.""""Hopelessness is the root of anxiety, mental illness, and depression. It is the source of all misery and the cause of all addictions."" ""We are moved to action only by emotion. That’s because action IS emotion.""""Why don’t we do the things we should do? Because we don’t feel like it.""""Always ask yourself ‘how do you feel about this?’""""Thinking brain, you may not have self control but you do have meaning control. This is your superpower. This is your gift. You get to control the meaning of your impulses and feelings. You get to decide for them however you see fit. You get to draw the map. This is incredible powerful because it’s the meaning that we ascribe to our feelings that can often alter how the feeling brain reacts to them. And this is how you produce hope.""""The Gods wanted to create a companion for mankind, someone who would command the men’s whole attention, someone who would introduce complication and uncertainty to the easy life of shotgunning bear cans and to playing fuss ball all night. So they decided to create the first woman. For this project all of the major Gods helped out: Aphrodite gave her beauty, Athena gave her wisdom, Hera gave her the ability to create a family, Hermes gave her a charismatic speech. On an on the Gods installed gifts and talents and intrigues into the new woman like apps into a new iPhone. The result was Pandora."""

It made some good points and connections, but most of its substance is discussed better elsewhere (for example, Daniel Kahneman’s “Thinking Fast and Slow”). It does read quickly and relatively easily, so in a sense one can “hack” (said ironically given the book’s points about “hacks”) a bunch of perennial wisdom. The tone of the book could be controversial, as it can come off as a “f*ck it” attitude. I think some people will love this tone and others will hate it. Personally I found it mildly annoying. I would say that it is worth a read, but don’t expect too much and you will probably be pleasantly surprised."

He is straight forward, speaks his beliefs, very mature themes and dive into things maybe people are uncomfortable in.I really enjoyed the first book he release. However this one though was not as much. I feel like he uses on examples such as religion, war histories and culture through the understanding of his opinions and research but it may not be the same agreement to the reader hence it disturbs the reading enjoyment of the reader.I skip through some parts which I find not needed or the example he uses was just not getting to me.There are some parts that are amazing and make sense. The things I wish people around me will tell me or someone will. You know when you give someone advice and you wish you listen to it, yep there are some parts that does that to me. So i did a whole lot of highlighting there and just a good reminder now and then when I am in both a good and bad place in life.I feel like in this one there are some parts I did not agree on with Mark as compared to the first book.I feel like the first one was more familiar and I be able to relate more.Mark's mind just amaze me on how he looks towards life. Sometimes I am like why didn't I think like that. But I guess no matter how much motivation or inspirational books each of us read, we all have our own journey and the way we deal with life and that is okay. There is no right or wrong answer. But sometimes its nice when we feel lost there is someone or something to guide us. “I have tried to live my life such that in the hour of my death I would feel joy rather than fear.”"

The key is to navigate the relationship between emotional response and action.‘The only true form of freedom, the only ethical form of freedom, is through self-limitation. It is not the privilege of choosing everything you want in your life, but rather, choosing what you will give up.’The first half of the book explains the importance of hope, the second half explores the horrors of a world without hope, a world in which people feel disconnected and undervalued.In this book, we are being asked to think about how to address an absence of hope, to think about how we can each become the best adult we can be. Philosophy is part of the answer and I confess that I found Mr Manson’s contemporary presentations of Plato, Newton, Kant, Nietzsche, Freud and Einstein comparatively easy to read and understand.Worth reading.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70211-claudia,Rating 4 out of 5,"I was excited about this book because I loved the first one...this is different, with a different tone. It is sticky-noted and annotated in the margins as I tried to put it all together.What resonated most deeply, and saved the book for me, was his discussion of maturity...of our journey through childhood and adolescence, to, for SOME of us, adult thinking. He combined the research of Piaget, Kohlberg, Erickson, Kierkegaard, and a new name for me, Kegan...What are our values and our goals and our missions as we mature? Kant's Formula for Humanity helps ground all this...What do we WANT as we grow? Children want pleasure; adolescents bargain for that pleasure and formulate rules. True adults (only 13% of us...Sorry!!) seek self-awareness, humility, awareness, consciousness. Adults act unconditionally...no bargaining. Acceptance of their own behavior. Much to consider...much to work toward.So...the subtitle is, A Book About Hope. But maybe hope isn't the best goal to have...maybe living our goals, searching for virtues should be the goal. Maybe that quest for hope brings us unintended consequences that actually make it harder to live as self-actualized adults. When you read this book, READ THE ENDNOTES!! "

142,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52553772-neha-shehrawat,Rating 3 out of 5,"I had so high hopes from this one. But Mark Manson is right about one thing. That hope is a dangerous thing. It will be wrong to say that I didn't like this novel, but surely his first one is far better than this one. I actually have mixed feelings while writing this review. There were moments where he caught me out of the blue, when he explained how hope can uplift us, or it can destroy us; the story of Quang Duc, so captivating and heartbreaking; when he talked about Nietzsche and Amor Fati, it was astonishing. Only it gets dull when he starts talking about how it's so easy to create our own religion and its prerequisites. We all are somewhere aware of it. He talks about our Thinking Brain and Feelings Brain or as we say mind and heart. Or while he talked about Final Religion and AI takes over the planet, well, we are aware of that as well. I think the novel was Okay. Not that good and not that bad either. But if given a chance, I would prefer reading his Subtle art of not giving fu*k twice than reading this one again. I am still not giving up on Mark Manson though."

Although I can admit at some points what he was trying to say made my concentration fly away, the most of the time I was absorbed by his writing. He presented some important points that make you question your thinking and make you open your mind. He points out this new perspectives in an ironical, funny but simultaneously serious way that make you realise in what kind of world we live or how we CHOOSE to use our brain, feelings, thoughts. I guess you would have to read this one to truly understand what I mean. So, with that said, I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone. In my case, it really changed my mind and my understanding for some uncertainties.Something I loved: the presentation of Feeling Brain vs Thinking BrainQuote: ""Self-control is an illusion that occurs when both brains are aligned and pursuit the same course of action."""

Do I agree with everything that's in this book? Nope. But I'll insert here some quotes from the book for later reference. Until then, hope for nothing.One day, you and everyone you love will die. And beyond a small group of people for an extremely brief period of time, little of what you say or do will even matter. This is the Uncomfortable Truth of life. And everything you think or do is but an elaborate avoidance of it. We are inconsequential cosmic dust, bumping and milling about on a tiny blue speck. We imagine our own importance. We invent our purpose—we are nothing. Enjoy your fucking coffee.By experiencing our hopes, we lose them. We see that our beautiful visions for a perfect future are not so perfect, that our dreams and aspirations are themselves riddled with unexpected flaws and unforeseen sacrifices. Because the only thing that can ever truly destroy a dream is to have it come true.They forgot that the world doesn’t run on information. People don’t make decisions based on truth or facts. They don’t spend their money based on data. They don’t connect with each other because of some higher philosophical truth. The world runs on feelings.Why don't we do things we know we should do? Because we don't feel like it. Every problem of self-control is not a problem of information or discipline or reason, but, rather, of emotion. Self-control is an emotional problem. Laziness is an emotional problem. Procrastination is an emotional problem. Underachievement is an emotional problem. Impulsiveness is an emotional problem. This sucks, because emotional problems are much harder to deal with than logical ones.It basically meant: hope for nothing. Hope for what already is—because hope is ultimately empty. Anything your mind can conceptualize is fundamentally flawed and limited and therefore damaging if worshipped unconditionally. Don’t hope for more happiness. Don’t hope for less suffering. Don’t hope to improve your character. Don’t hope to eliminate your flaws.Hope for this. Hope for the infinite opportunity and oppression present in every single moment. Hope for the suffering that comes with freedom. For the pain that comes from happiness. For the wisdom that comes from ignorance. For the power that comes from surrender.because as intelligence increases, so does the intensity of suffering"

A lot of my erratic thoughts found a shape and grounding in this book, not because they were going in opposite direction but because of the high resonance after all we like to consume what aligns with out beliefs. Biased like that. That got too personal. But, this book is really objectively looking at how we function as human beings. I feel somewhat humbled after reading this. Not exactly sure right now why that is the case. Some takeaways:- Values and our feeling brain steer the world, not the thinking brain.- Freedom is not the same as variety, on the contrary in fact. - Pain is constant. Going away from pain is not happiness, feeling it through and accepting its role is. - Happiness is not in choosing pleasure but in managing pain.- With more technology, our suffering reduces but the pain we expect from life remains the same and as a result we feel more pain in smaller incidents. - We need to encourage anti fragility and self-imposed limitations than protecting everyone's feelings. - Let's choose some trouble, some pain and live in them than avoid it altogether to get more fragile- Democracy gives us what we want. However, that does not ensure much freedom or happiness because what we want and what our feeling brain wants sucks.- Treat people, not as means, but ends.- There is more freedom in commitment than in paradox of choice. In variety there is fake freedom and in commitment there is meaningful freedom.Don't hope for better. Just be better.I highly recommend this book."
168,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38844777-anangsha-alammyan,Rating 3 out of 5,"I loved how this book began. Mark Manson talks about how humans actually have two brains - the ""thinking brain"" which is the logical, rational part, and the ""feeling brain"" - the one that takes decisions ""from the heart"" and is actually in control. The feeling brain takes us in whichever direction it wants to go, and the thinking brain makes up excuses and rational justifications for the direction we chose to tread on.So far so good.But then, the author starts talking about religion and what you had to do if you were to start your own religion. I had recently completed reading Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. There was nothing in Manson's thoughts that I hadn't read in Harari's words before. At this point, the novel started to feel repetitive. I couldn't carry on further after that.However, if you are new to the concept of organised religion, this book can serve as a good refresher course. However, if you want to delve in deep and not simply skim the surface, ""Sapiens"" is a better option."

171,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23744955-livia,Rating 5 out of 5,"I’m adding the audiobook format and will update this with a more complete review after I finish listening to this non-fiction book.Format read: Unabridged Audiobook via Los Angeles Public Library loanNarrated by: Mark Manson (the author)Length: 7 hrs and 2 minsRelease Date: 05-14-19Publisher: HarperAudio The end of chapter 1 (I believe) was full of wise gems. I was running errands when I started this audiobook novel, so I could not easily bookmark while I was driving. There is so much I can relate to in this one so far, and of course, they are fantastic observations about behavior, Cognitive Behavior Therapywhich I just learned in my work stress clinic that ended earlier this month. I was at the mall when the below favorite observation thus far was shared by the author. This is approximately 2 hours and 13 minutes in:‘All peoples are more the same than they are different. We all mostly want the same things out of life. But those slight differences generate emotion. And emotion generates a sense of importance. Therefore, we come to perceive our differences as disproportionately more important than our similarities. And this is the true tragedy of man, that we are doomed to perpetual conflict over the slight difference.’ Full Review Added: 6/1/19I’m not going to attempt to summarize what this non-fiction book is about. The synopsis does that very well. This book caught my eye thanks to the author doing a book signing event at the Barnes & Noble – The Grove location in West Hollywood, California that unfortunately I couldn’t attend in person. The author and the fans in attendance at the signing took a really cool picture of all of them holding up the book, thus prompting me to read the synopsis and then subsequently checking it out from my local library via their Overdrive lending system.I agreed with so much of what the author said. His observations were similar to ones I had made on my own or facts about human behavior that I have learned. For example, I recently learned the importance of controlling anxiety through the Cognitive Behavior Therapy which he mentioned in his book as well. I liked how he also incorporated historical figures and pop culture – Skynet, anyone? Or his rant about AI listening to his conversations with his wife and then sending ads to him online, lol! - into his observations that supported now well-established psychology. ★¸¸.•*¨*•★Unabridged Audiobook Info★•*¨*•.¸¸★Narrated by: Mark MansonLength: 7 hrs and 2 minsRelease Date: 05-14-19Publisher: HarperAudio Ratings Overall ★★★★★ This is a must-read for understanding human behavior during our reactionary social media era.Performance ★★★★★ Surprisingly, the author did a great job narrating his own material. He wasn’t flat at all and knew exactly how to vary his tone and infuse some sporadic humor into his performance.Story ★★★★★So, I did a lot of bookmarking and attempted to transcribe some of my favorite observations in this non-fiction book. Since I don’t own a copy of the actual book, I’m sharing all of them here. Don’t read on if you don’t want spoilers!★¸¸.•*¨*•★Spoilers alert★•*¨*•.¸¸★You exist. You didn’t do anything to deserve existing. You don’t even know why you started existing. You just did. Boom. You have a life. And you have no idea where it came from or why. If you believe God gave it to you, then holy shit do you owe him big time. If even if you don’t believe in God, damn your blessed with life. What did you ever do to deserve that? How can you live in such a way to make your life worthwhile? This is the constant and yet unanswerable question of the human condition. And why the inherent guilt of consciousness is the cornerstone of almost every spiritual religion. 3hr05min approximatelyPrayer is like a gratitude journal. Guilt alleviation. 3hr7minI disagree with the author regarding the Buddhist monk setting himself on fire without screaming out in pain. He thought it was horrific but inspiring. In my opinion, this monk’s actions were just horrifying and a waste of a human life. He probably had a lot more to contribute to this world, but we’ll never know because he felt he had to make this kind of tragic and dramatic gesture. 5hr25min approximatelyThat pain is inevitable, but suffering is a choice. 5hrs36min approximatelyPain is a universal constant...Pain is the source of all value. 5hrs45min approximatelyI paraphrased greatly: Death is psychologically necessary to create stakes, to understand value. To grow is to successfully navigate pain. The pursuit of happiness shouldn’t be our life goal. It should instead be to have a life of character, the ability to sustain pain and navigate chaos. 5hrs47min approximatelyVariety is not freedom...More stuff doesn’t make us freer. It imprisons us with anxiety over whether we chose or did the best thing...In a vacuum, variety is meaningless. 6hrs11min approximately Life hacks are forms of fake freedom because people try to reap rewards without putting in the time commitment. Paraphrased. Committing to having less is freedom. Fake freedom is addictive and has diminishing returns. 6hrs17min approximatelyLoneliness is also a growing issue. Last year, for the first time a majority of Americans said they were lonely. And new research is suggesting that we’re replacing a few high-quality relationships in our lives with a large number of superficial and temporary relationships. 6hrs19 approximately Nukes wouldn’t be a problem if there weren’t some dumb fuck tempted to use them. 6hrs45min approximately"

Żyjemy w najbezpieczniejszych, najbardziej dostatnich czasach w historii, a mimo to poziom stresu, niezadowolenia i nieszczęścia psychicznego jest wyższy niż kiedykolwiek. Zgadzam się z nim. I moim zdaniem jest tak dlatego, że gonimy za czymś, czego nigdy nie złapiemy. Z drugiej strony, kiedy odpowiednio poukładać sobie w głowie, życie może być satysfakcjonujące i wypełnione radością.Polecam tę książkę, jeśli:- lubicie zamyślić się nad sensem życia- dobrze Wam robią mentalne kopniaki w tyłek- akceptujecie prosty i dosadny język- nie znacie książek zgłębiających filozofie, szczególnie stoicyzmNie polecam, jeśli:- jesteście w psychicznym dołku- uruchamia Was podważanie dogmatów religii- macie obcykane książki filozoficzne"
173,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82958506-nasar,Rating 4 out of 5,"An interesting read. This is more of a pop-philosophy work (with psychological underpinnings) rather than a typical self-help one, although it's written in the same spirit. And it was refreshing to come across a work where the focus was not on the superficial aspects of personal development, but instead on the core principles behind the ideas of 'getting better' or 'having a good life' (the question of 'why' rather than 'how').'Re-evaluation of values' has been one of the central themes in philosophy, with direct practical implications (many of them to do with what people love to consume from the generic self-help books/articles) and yet it remains evidently untouched by popular self-help authors. Not that Mr Manson has produced anything original or game-changing, it's just that whatever he did was a step in the right direction (atleast that's how I see it).His previous book was definitely more fun to read but, as far as the themes are concerned, this one seemed to have more depth. Also, it would be better to see it as a series of essays, loosely connected to the problem of values and hope. I enjoyed it."

It's a bit more chaotic and all over the place, although the idea itself is still interesting. Why the current world is like this, why people seem to be more unhappy each day even though in general life gets so much better than a hundred years ago? And why hope become one of the biggest (but also the most devastating) factors in our so called happiness?It's still snarky, witty and full of dark humor. And I still recommend it for people who love Manson's previous book. "

I was worried for the first chapter or two that I would hate it because the author comes off as kind of a dick. This was quelled, or at least diluted, by his historical anecdotes and commentary. The only other thing I didn't like was his ""comedic"" use of curse words. I'm not offended by them, I just don't find it funny when they are used specifically to be funny. It seems too fake I guess.Anyway, I'm a sucker for historical anecdotes and there are plenty in here. I appreciated the amount of research done for this book. It's not just Manson's outlook on life. Although there is a lot of that as well. Some of his ideas I disagree with, but I feel like, for a book titled ""Everything is F*cked,"" the author was actually fairly respectful to other ideologies other than his own.

When he professed his atheism, that was my cue to get outta there. I have nothing against other people’s religious beliefs, but the fact of the matter is that he is his own higher power. A lot of truths are in this book, but at the same time, it’s too depressing to listen to a harsh reality we all experience."

This one is written in textbook language with a few f-bombs thrown in to remind us who the author is. I can’t believe it, but I actually prefer the writing in the first book. This is boring and wandering and Manson can’t seem to hold a thread. The only sections worth noting were in the “self-control is an illusion” chapter but even then his language is getting in its own way. "

Mark Manson has sth to say and i really recommend that we should hear it.“Being heroic is the ability to conjure hope where there is none.”“When we deny ourselves the ability to feel pain for a purpose, we deny ourselves the ability to feel any purpose in our life at all.”"

197,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61808093-alexander-rivas,Rating 5 out of 5,"7/14/19I decided to reread this book because the first read was so good but it didn't have the same impact as the first read. A lot of the content the author brought to light in this book was new to me and was so stimulated Intellectually on this first read. What I did get out of it this time was the power of hope in a deep way where I see my self kind of preaching it to others. I have gained awareness of how people are not consciously using hope to there benefit or at times to save them. It is kind of worrying me how much people around avoid hope or don't seem to understand the importance of hope that this book does so well of expressing.Another important aspect of this book is the mission of comforting your uncomfortable truth, which is something I'm working on identifying. It seems easier to spot in others than spotting them in yourself and that could be from how much time and effort I have put into avoiding those uncomfortable truths. Lastly, I paid more attention to the content of the differences between the ""thinking brain"" and the ""feeling brain"" this time because it reminded to ""Thinking. Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman. Understanding what part of the brain is influencing you are being stimulated is key to attaining a higher level of consciousness. 6/6/19This is one of the best books I have read in 2019 and much better than his prior book ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck."" After reading this book I am inspired to read Friedrich Nietzche's books because prior to this book I had the idea he was just a nihilist. It has also given me a different perspective on the coming AI revolution that doesn't make it seem like the end of the world but just a transition to knew gods we worship. The section on Edward Bernays is just genius to me and brought clarity to why marketing as morphed into what it is today.Even the content on Immanuel Kant was fascinating and also inspired me to start reading some of his books. I know this author is known for giving contrasting advice to the majority of other ""self-help"" books out there and he continues that strategy in this book. If you enjoying reading a different view on how our society got to where we are today and a different view on how to live in our society, this is the book."

You have found your man.This book is truly not about hope at all. The vast majority of Manson’s time is spent making very odd philosophic conjectures that often lead to very problematic conclusions. How was this ever a book that was recommended anywhere?!??[audiobook’ed it]"
199,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14551209-dan-connors,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a tough book to read- full of ideas and not a whole lot of hope. I had to read it and listen to the audiobook to get the story.The author cover a lot of ground-- The feeling brain vs the thinking brain, and which one is charge (feelings)- How to start a new religion- The blue dot effect and how our assumptions and expectations cloud our perceptions of what is really happening.- The uncomfortable truth and how we avoid accepting that we will die and our legacy will be minimal if any.- The hedonic treadmill, and how our expectations shift as our life circumstances change. We never attain happiness because the next hill appears as we reach the top of the last hill.- Nietsche and his ""God is Dead"" philosophy- Kant and his ""treat others as ends and never as means to an end"" philosophy- The feelings economy and how advertising appeals to our inner child and gives them what they want, even if the inner adult knows it's not good for you.- For some reason, pain is good and the universal constant- The story of Witold Pilecki is worth the read alone- would make a great movieSo after all this dive into some interesting topics, Manson hits us at the end with why everything is f*cked- climate change, nuclear war, and artificial intelligence. If anything should inspire hope and change, it would be those three, but instead the suicide rate is increasing, drug abuse is escalating, and even leaders look like they've given up and are just phoning it in until the inevitable. I guess I wanted to be more uplifted than this book provides. The final chapter tries to pull things together, but I wish it had more to offer. ""Don't hope for better- be better"" is his war cry. But before we can be better we have to have an inner story that makes us feel a tiny bit in control. That things matter- truth and character matter. Fascinating book but left me wanting more..."
200,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8625721-alessandra,Rating 5 out of 5,"Tocmai am terminat prima carte pe 2020 si nu pot spune cat de mult mi-a placut de aceasta data Mark Manson.Am citit de la el si ""The subtle art of not giving a fuck"" care m-a lasat rece. Abordarea acolo era destul de liniara, o serie de povesti personale, fără niciun fel de imput psihologic, istoric, sociologic, printre care presarase intes cuvinte colorate. Înțeleg ca e un element distinct pentru cărțile lui, dar nu exista un echilibru iar vocabularul mi s-a părut doar o forma de a atrage atentia de la inexistenta substantei.⭕️De aceasta data, prin ""Everything is fucked"" - din nou gasim acelasi titlu colorat care e clar ca îl diferențiază de alți autori- în conținut se observa o maturizare a lui ca si autor. Probabil influentat de Harari, am observat acolo o structura asemanatoare ca in Sapiens si Homo Deus, Manson livreaza o carte extrem de concisa, bine conturata ca structura.Abordează subiecte extrem de sensibile precum religia, relatiile, viitorul, istorie si psihologie într-un mod extrem de relaxat. Explica felul de a gandi al oamenilor, despre necesitatea găsirii unui scop personal, despre comportamente deviante, despre cum viața este acum infinit mai sigură si trăim intr-o abundență nemaintalnita, oamenii sunt mai nefericiti. Aduce in discutie scrierile si viața lui Friedrich Nietzsche, Plato, despre nemurire si cum ne va afecta atingerea ei existenta si valorile, despre roboți si o religie viitoare. Nu este o carte profetică pentru ca, real, nimeni nu poate prezice viitorul si felul în care va evolua omenirea, dar este o carte care pe mine personal m-a ajutat. O recomand tuturor celor care își doresc o lectura usoara dar profundă in același timp. Pare ca Manson a descoperit rețeta scrierilor de succes.#Selfdevelopment #everithingisfucked #markmanson #psihologie #religie #dezvoltarepersonala"
201,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68384348-stiltzkin-vanserine,Rating 4 out of 5,"For me, this book isn't as hard-hitting as The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, not a slap in the face or a punch to the gut. It is, however, more thought-provoking.Mark Manson draws inspiration heavily from the ideas of philosophers such as Plato, Kant, and Nietzsche, blending his arguments with historical events and a hefty sum of social commentary. His trademark frankness and humor is still perceivable, though a bit more subtle than the last book.We live in a paradoxical age. Our material comfort has never been better, and we live in the most peaceful time of human history. Yet, we aren't happy. So many modern society-induced illnesses such as depression and anxiety are growing day by day. We have the Internet and infinite connection, but we seem to be more lonely than ever. Why?It's because the pursuit of happiness is, in fact, a fallacy. Manson reminds us that pain is the only constant of life. What gives life meaning is not the pleasure you choose, it's the pain, the sacrifice. As psychologist Viktor E. Frankl famously said, ""When man cannot find a deep sense of meaning in life, he distracts himself with pleasure."" We live in a world filled with mind-numbing pleasure and distractions; thus, we are lost.Amor fati. It's Latin, which literally means ""love of fate."" This is an attitude proposed by Nietzsche as well as many Stoic philosophers of the past. To hope that something happens not the way you want it to, but the way it's supposed to. It also echoes the line spoken by Amy Adams in the movie Arrival: ""Despite knowing the journey and where it leads, I embrace it, and I welcome every moment of it."""
202,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9763366-sonnet-fitzgerald,Rating 2 out of 5,"My brother, whom I love, and who is also a severe alcoholic who has lost everything in his life due to his disease and been told he would not survive the night more times than I can count, mailed me this book from the shelter he's currently living in so I could read it. My brother is a sweetheart, and he has faced a lot of loss and despair in his life. He is also a cishet white male, born into the world with a breathtaking amount of privilege, and I truly think the only people this book really appeals to will fall into this category.It's not that the content is bad per se, it's not! There were some great insights and fun information. The writing style is very casual and of-the-moment, but it never irritated me the way some other books written in that style do. I don't want to slam it completely, because it's a way of looking at things that is going to be helpful to some people, and you can tell the author is earnest AF about this content. I respect that, and I hope the author continues to communicate helpful ideas to the people who will find them helpful.It's just the whole thing has this vibe of coming from someone who has absolutely never faced the kind of systemic forces most of the world does, almost Pollyanna-like in the belief that YOU can do ANYTHING with the right attitude! And it's glazed in a very sour coating of ableism and sexism that grated on me terribly. I don't use the term ""microaggressions"" often but geez, this book is a collection of them. I doubt the author is aware of this at all and of course none of it is intentional. But still.To me, it's not worth the postage my brother paid, unfortunately. I'm still glad it gave him hope and purpose."

Here are a few of my takeaways.Hope, apparently, is a bad thing. So is religion which is the source of hope. It's because of hope for better we do bad things to ourselves and each other. Can't argue with that.Instead of right brain, left brain we have Feeling brain, which is driving the consciousness car, and Thinking brain which is slow on the uptake and keeps the car on the road. This metaphor was beaten to death, revived and the run over a few times. Our default happiness setting in a scale of 1 to 10 is a 7. We expect a certain amount of evil and will superimpose it where it doesn't exist to make ourselves right.Again, I can see the logic here.The AI takeover is inevitable. Dude, tell me something I don't know. Any author that has been trying to scratch together a living using Facebook ads or Amazon algorithm is well aware of this fact. We spend hours trying to caress the AIs like two-bit whores just to scratch out a living. Okay so all that aside, the most disturbing part of this book is that the author mainly hopes that being uploaded to the cloud when the AI's take over will happen before some Feeling Brain driven nut job blows us to Kingdom Come. I have watched way too much Sci-Fi to ever be okay with this end result. Sign me up for the resistance. Marketable skills, being contrary, especially to know-it-all male authors."
204,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50011497-amanda,Rating 5 out of 5,"I guess you know you love a book when you never want it to end, right? In this follow-up to The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck, Mr. Manson uses his combo of personal insights, anecdotes from philosophers and other writers whose work you were probably supposed to read in school but didn't, and references to real world events/pop culture to expand and illustrate his argument on the false security and even danger hope can put us in, individually as well as a society. He forces readers to confront what he refers to as ""The Uncomfortable Truth""-the reality that individually we will not leave a large impact on the world and that the idea of a ""life's purpose"" is basically full of it-and provides a guideline to how we can better go about life with that knowledge.One of my favorite things about Mr. Manson is his ability to make what seems like a dull lesson much more engaging. One section in particular that I enjoyed much more than I expected to was Kant's theory of consciousness in Chapter 6. After illustrating the difference between child, adolescent and adult mindsets and how they interpret pain and pleasure in their everyday instances, he brings in Kant's belief that humans' ability to think critically sets the species apart; and that part of our purpose in life should be to cultivate and expand this ability to reason logically. I can already say that this one of my favorite reads of the year. I borrowed the book from the library, but plan to purchase my own copy soon so that I can attack it with sticky notes and a highlighter."

And, Having both read, I can safely say that this one is far better than the previous one. The sarcasm and wit used by Mark Manson is just brilliant, turning this factful book into a fun read. This book is definitely well researched, more mature, satisfying and life changing - urging the reader to be a better person or to take an action. However, few parts in the book got too dragged that I lost my interest mid-way and had to take a detour.▪️While the previous book explained how we shouldn't give a damn about certain things, this one talks about things that we should care about. Themes discussed in the book include, HOPE, Faith, Self-Control, Maturity, social media and religion along with several others. ▪️There are chapters that'll hit a nerve because you'll disagree with it. There's this discussion on interpersonal religion which made me think, Bookstagram is a religion too- for we all share similar beliefs, interests and values.▪️Also, the colored bookmarks are a proof of the lines & facts I absolutely fell in love with. One that really got to me was,'Self control is an emotional problem & emotional problems are harder to deal with than the logical ones. Hence, control is an illusion.'Those of you who liked the previous book will absolutely love this one, and those of you who didn't, you'll end up liking this one!!!I'll definitely recommend this one to you guys, it left a lasting impact on me."

This has impelled me to pick up his second book Everything is F*cked: A Book About Hope and had great expectations from it.However, I did not find it to be much of a page turner with some practical advice as more a research into human psychology and the functioning of the mind. The chapters are long drawn out and fail to engage after a point. Moreover, I could not find any prominent takeaway from the book other than that the human mind is a complex system with often many contradictions and paradoxes. I would not recommend this book, however, if one is a fan of research & science works, they can give this book a shot."

A great book to read.I really liked It and the expectations set by the earlier book of mark Manson subtle art of not to give a fuck were met by this book also.Indeed a very knowledgeable book I would say specially the incident in Vietnam gave me goosebumps.The witty style of writing of Mark Manson will keep you amused and glued to the book, there were various instances in the book when i actually started laughing because of his sarcasm and jokes.The concept of emotional brain side and logical brain side and who is driving the car and why is an eye opener.The middle section of the book is about how to start your own religion. You know, belief systems, followers, rituals, scapegoats. Don’t worry, it all makes sense at the end.🤣And I agree that Living well doesn’t mean avoiding suffering: it means suffering for the right reasons. Get better at feeling bad. Don’t hope. Don’t despair either. Just be better. Be more compassionate, more resilient, more humble, more disciplined. Maybe meditate. Though actual Buddhist meditation is hard. You’re supposed to suck at it.

Para além disso, o autor vai buscar exemplos tanto da sua vida como exemplos históricos para explicar o que pretende tornando a sua leitura mais interessante. Este registo manteve-se neste e, à semelhança do anterior, gostei bastante. Apenas achei que tinha demasiadas notas de rodapé que, a partir do 2 capitulo, não li mais por achar que interrompia em demasia a leitura."

Per dire, in dieci pagine illustra pensieri nicciani e kantiani con ironia, pulizia e logica, con note a margine che approfondiscono o rimandano ad altri testi. Illustra fin da subito una (LA) Scomoda Verità di cui ero già a conoscenza, ma messa così è ancora più affascinante. In questo libro, più che nel precedente, si vede che Manson ha studiato: filosofia, psicologia, università della strada - ma non da coglione.Un bel saggio: attuale, utile e squisitamente dissacrante. Sulla parte finale dedicata alla AI sospendo il giudizio, perché l’ ipotesi mi sembra assai lontana, nel quotidiano.Molto utili le pagine delle note, che hanno generato ulteriori acquisti di libri."

Makes some good points, although much of it may seem self evident to anyone with a background in philosophy and/or psychology. Love the humorous spin on all sorts of topics. He’s right about pain being the only constant and that pain is not always bad for us. He’s right about the need for more discipline and emotional maturity. His conclusions about AI (artificial intelligence) seem about right to me. Overall, a very timely look at our modern age—how we got into this mess and what steps we can take to improve our lot. "

Some of the ideas Manson puts together here at first seem wild and random but when he explains it, it’s genius. Hello, Nietzsche and Kant, and woah, Plato and Bernay, to name a few. And I knew going through this that many people would hate this. But he’s so so right about the state of our society today. His observations of the weaknesses of BOTH sides of the political divide here are on point. I’m sure I’ll be adding more to this as I think about how much I loved this book.

I don't want to end up hate-reading it like I did his previous one. I was morbidly curious to see where it goes but from these first few chapters, I can already see that he wrote this to mansplain his way through the concepts he picked here and there on the internet or maybe even a few books. His musings on life are lunch hour talks with my coworkers. On top of this, that ego of his that gives him the impression that he's some sort of ""millennial philosopher"" is seriously off-putting."

My opinion is that this book perfectly accomplishes its purpose. It is not meant to be academic nor be compared with different classics. I agree that the language was not necessary to deliver the message, but the purpose was to draw attention. Realistically, the average person doesn’t read Nietzsche, Kant, or other philosohers, so the author brings very well researched ideas and presents them in a easy mannner for the wide public. It does trigger curiosity, questions, and interest."

He writes in such an irreverent way, especially at the beginning of the book, that I continued to be skeptical. But by the middle he dealt with the topic of what makes life meaningful really well and then I ended up getting a lot out of the book.Debating between 4 and 5 stars."

Full of contradictions. The book leads you down the path from hope to nihilism to existentialism as the only proper way to live. But if ""everything is f*cked"", then why isn't existentialism also f*cked? Where does it end? It is a great book about our necessity to hope and how to hope better and not fall into despair (ch. 1-8 are really good) but his conclusions in ch. 9 are just a big contradiction, which sadly changes your perspective on the book."

I liked the comparisons with theories in physics (what Newton’s laws would have look like if applied in sociology or psychology) and some of the stories presented to prove the points along the book. The only chapter I resonated with is chapter 7: pain is the only constant. It talks about how the pursuit of happiness is a new modern concern, how it affects the way we perceive it and our satisfaction. While pain is inevitable, suffering is always a choice."

228,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37101241-carmel,Rating 2 out of 5,I quite enjoyed Mark Manson's first book and certainly more than this one. Perhaps it is because as I read this one I didn't feel like there was anything new that he really explored and perhaps again that is because I saw him live discussing the book and its contents. Its a bit hit and miss with its research - picks up on what he wants to hear? - and sometimes a bit offensive ( but I guess that is to be expected with a title and his style).

247,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/85995365-vali-c,Rating 5 out of 5,"If you are looking for a somewhat easy read that can simultaneously radically change your outlook on life and the driving forces behind people's seemingly erratic behaviours throughout history you can stop here. This book gave me more ""Eureka!"" moments than any other book I have read so far. While I can't say that the author comes up with radical brand new ideas as I do not claim to have read that much on philosophy I can definitely say that he has a knack for explaining complicated philosophical ideas in really simple terms that make you feel like you ""get it"". A lot of times I was actually concerned with the fact that things can't be that simple and there must be something more to a particular concept that might have suffered from oversimplification. Well, I haven't found a definite answer to this yet, but I would advise you to try to decide it for yourself and enjoy the ride.Similar to his previous book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck"", Mark Manson adopts a down to earth and sometimes colorful language throughout the book. He somehow manages to break down difficult concepts and proceeds to explain them in a very accessible way, sometimes drawing parallels to modern life and always adding in a bit of good humour. That being said, he is not averse to using ""big words"" when necessary. I can recall some occasions when I had to look up some words in a dictionary, but I'm not a native speaker so that could be the reason as well.Without spoiling too much of the book I can say that I really liked the idea of splitting religion into three categories (supernatural, ideological and interpersonal) and explaining how they all have in common the element of hope and the promise of a better future. The author's use of ""hope"" throughout the book is a bit different than the mainstream or maybe even correct definition, but I feel like he does a good job of explaining it in the beginning, especially in the footnotes. The first part of the book is about explaining why hope may not necessarily be a good thing after all and the second part concerns itself with the crisis of hope that we currently have in the modern world. The second part is also the place where the author sets out to try and envision a way of life in the absence of it. Manson heavily draws from Nietzsche, Kant and other great philosophers and manages to tie some of their biggest ideas together in order to make his point. His explanation of Nietzsche's ""amor fati"" is the best one I have seen so far and I feel like it really helped me develop an understanding of the concept after having struggled with it before.The ""make your own religion"" chapter is really funny and tongue in cheek. The author goes deep inside the value systems that we all have in our lives and manages to make some very insightful observations. If you ever wondered why some people do not seem to have grasped basic empathy or compassion even well into adulthood this book offers a really interesting theory about that. It draws from psychology when describing a three step system of values consisting of child, adolescent and eventually adult values that a person adopts at each developmental point in their life. There is a nice footnote here showing that 89 percent of people do not ever cross over into the ""adult"" phase throughout their lives so make of that what you will.When considering some possible negative aspects of the book I have to say that this book is definitely not scientific. The author draws from a lot of scientific studies and philosophical treaties, but the writing style is far removed from what you might expect from a more rigorous study. However, if you keep this in mind and treat this as a pop science book you are definitely in for a great time. One pro tip that I have actually discovered at the end is to try and read the footnotes as well when going through the chapters. There is a lot of interesting information there that you might otherwise miss out on.All in all, this is a true 5 / 5. I cannot recommend this highly enough!"
248,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71086404,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book started with telling a story of a hero who helped people to survive since 1918- 1947.After that it was about how people base their life after their loved ones died or someone close died they continue to live their life in away to make their loved one proud. Also the author linked this fact with the fact that religious people suffer from depression and commit suicide in far fewer numbers than non religious that is because they have hopes. To build and maintain hope you need to develop a sense of control, belief in the value of something, and a community. The author tells a story to show the importance of self control in life by explain how a person who maintain his abilities of (intelligence, memory, and attention) and they were all in perfect shape after a successful surgery of brain tumor, however he lost his self-control (emotionless) which then led him to losing everything.In the book the author discussed the difference between two sides of our brain Thinking brain and Feeling brain 🧠. You would know the effect of having one of them driving the other one. After that he presented Newton’s Three laws of Emotion:First law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite emotional reaction.Second law: Our self-worth equals the sum of our emotions over time.Third law: Your identity will stay your identity until a new experience acts against it..In addition, the author mentioned in this book that our Thinking brain decides how things are, on the other hand our Feeling brain decides how things ought to be.The last chapter of the book is about Artificial intelligent (AI), still I don’t know why he relate god to it, by saying (AI gods) WHAT!! 🤨 Also are we basing our future on “what if?”, the author in last chapter showed me how far our imagination could reach, he kept assuming the worst thing to happen in future when AI take control of the world 🌎. Is it about hope or fear from the future..Note:”I disagree with the author in the area of religion not all of it but in most parts, He mentioned in this book that he questioned his family’s faith and went atheist at age twelve😅. And now he has a whole chapter in this book about religion (how to start your own religion) and how to let others follow you (what a surprise). I wonder If he started his own religion because it didn’t make any sense. I liked the part where he said that he likes to ask questions and the problem he faced is that nobody give him an answer that satisfy him, well maybe you weren’t asking the correct people even if you did please don’t judge all religions based on your limited knowledge of one religion. I was surprised when I read this in his book: (No religion will ever make you feel blissful and peaceful all the time) really!! What do you know? Have you tried all religions or Have you done a research and got that conclusion?”.Quote:” Classic assumption: that the only way to be good person is through dominance of the Thinking Brain over the Feeling Brain, the championing of reason over emotions, duty over desire.”."

Buku kedua dari Mark Manson yang bisa saya gambarkan, ada empat kali lipat untuk bisa dipahami setiap paragrafnya alias saya kesulitan dalam memahami isi bukunya. Setelah menuntaskan buku ini dalam waktu yang berhari-hari dan di cicil setiap hari, bahwa memang buku ini tidak sesuai dengan judulnya. Buku ini jelas dari judulnya, isinya membahas tentang sebuah harapan dari berbagai bidang. Mulai dari harapan dalam ilmu kedokteran, psikologi, biologi, fisika, geografi, sampai dunia algoritma pun di bahas secara detail dan tentunya digambarkan dengan cerita-cerita pendek. Tapi jangan salah, meskipun cerita pendek, semua paragrafnya harus di cermati dengan baik supaya sampai maknanya. Tapi seperti yang saya katakan berkali-kali, bahwa ""Tidak semua buku itu penting, tapi setiap buku pasti punya kalimat penting."" Salah satu kalimat yang menurut saya bisa dijadikan poin penting, seperti kutipan yang saya rewrite di atas. Sederhana tapi maknanya jelas. Yang bikin saya terkejut adalah buku ini juga berisi tentang hal-hal yang sensitif, yang dibahas secara gamblang seputaran agama. Benar-benar menguras emosi dan pikiran untuk menuntaskan buku ini, jadi teman-teman yang penasaran dengan buku ini, sebaiknya pikir-pikir dulu. Pembahasannya cukup berat, tidak semudah untuk menyebut kata Ambyar yang ada di sampul buku ini."

Tajā laikā nebiju saskāries vai apzinājies nevienu Marka Mansona aprakstīto problēmu. Acīmredzot tas vairs nav stāsts, jo tad es turpinātu rakstīt savā kladē šos domu apkopojumus, nevis izplatījis tos internetā, kur nu vēl bildi ielicis sociālajos tīklos ar grāmatas vāku un kafiju. Sākot lasīt, viegli bija pārprast, ka grāmata būs vēstures bagātu cilvēku dzīves gājieni un aizraujoši stāsti. Bet ātri vien tos nomāca autora pesimistiskais skats par cilvēci, tehnoloģijām, nākotni un jebkuru citu lietu, kuras vārds sākas uz burta “da-jebkāda”. Ņem šo grāmatu rokās tikai, ja esi open-minded, jo saskarsies ar kontroversāliem uzskatiem un mācībām. Ja neesi gatavs uzklausīt kā cilvēci sabojāja cilvēciskums, visuma problēma ir cerība, tad šī grāmata nav priekš Tevis.

PS: one of my favorite thing I got from this book: Don’t hope for a better world, just be better."

Особено първите страници все едно са писани точно за периода, в който се намираме. „Тънкото изкуството да не ти пука“ беше много положителна. Книга, която ме разсмя и която ми показа, че не е правилно да не ни пука за нищо в този живот, а по-скоро да ни пука за наистина важните неща за нас в него. Признавам, очаквах нещо подобно като настроение и във „Всичко е прецакано“. Само че получих изненада от американския блогър.„Всичко е прецакано“ определено е много по-песимистична. Посрещна ме един малко ядосан Марк Менсън, доста по-критикуващ и определено по-научно обоснован. В предната си книга той залагаше повече на разговорен език, интересни примери. Не, че в тази ги няма – даже мисля, че той е задобрял в иронията, сарказма и забавното писане, но в тази книга се вижда, че вече той не е просто блогър, а писател, който е готов да задълбава в темата.

255,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24198246-prakash-yadav,Rating 5 out of 5,"My sincere opinion regarding this book its a f*cking good book. I recall having admired Manson for his earlier book that brought advanced concepts of personal development in a street vernacular that the target audience could relate more to. Once again he brings advanced philosophical ideas in a language rarely used in its usual circles.The book is primarily regarding Hope: its power, its limits, its usefulness and when its pointless or even harmful. Counter intuitive deductions from real life examples you will find fairly obvious. Witold Pilecki, Thích Quảng Đức, Kant, and other personalities are used as proofs as well as examples.Books can become compelling and convincing when expletives are strewn around like confetti. What I personally like about THIS book is that the fluid narrative doesn't run amock the pages like a monkey looking for a fan to fling its shit at. Ideas are well drafted and there is even a useful 20 page appendix at the end of the book. Accept it or not, Manson is the future of philosophy. Philosophy need not be an erudite topic to be discussed only in Academic circles. Manson shows us that a 3am soliloquy at a seedy bar can be equally deep and thoughtful. "
256,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16749385-sangeeta-sharma,Rating 5 out of 5,"For me, Mark Manson's books are remedial. Previously, the book talked about how not to give a f*ck, but this talks about how everything is already f*cked. I loved the subliminal manipulations that he discussed regarding marketing. During my best friend's MBA, I learnt how people are being manipulated at a subliminal level. This book is not only a self-help book, but it provides a panorama of knowledge that many must have belittled in their lives. Mentioning about Thích Quảng Đức was an ultimate eye-opener. Manson, who always research thoroughly before flooding with information takes a pedestal and guides his readers through the valley of human virtues. I was one of those who preordered this book well in advance only to be surprised by the content. His succinct writings didn't overwhelm but produced an assemblage of solutions that can be followed by a different notion. A quote that I am certainly taking to my grave would be ""That while pain is inevitable, suffering is always a choice. That there is always a separation between what we experience and how we interpret that experience. That there's always a gap between what our Feeling Brain feels and what our Thinking Brain thinks. And in that gap, you can find the power to bear anything."" "
257,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80892063-a-r,Rating 4 out of 5,"An enjoyable, a little controversial, and informative read that offered comprehensible analysis - for the lay person - of the nature of human beings and the reason for where we are as a species today, and our trajectory. Topics covered include the concept of hope and why and how we have formed it; this involves explaining the construct of our mind - a distinction between the thinking brain and the feeling brain - ‘laws of emotion’, eg that emotions have to be equalised, that our self-worth comes from an accumulation of emotions over time, and identity being dependent on all preceding experiences - changing when a new experience acts against it. Moreover, he also talks about religions, which he claims there are 3 types of: spiritual, ideological and inter-personal. With his bias, he argues all of these religions are man-made, all to help foster hope and achieve our agendas. Furthermore, he gives an argument on normative ethics, essentially defending Kant with his ‘formula for humanity’, and talks about the impact of technology and modern markets that thrive off of a consumerism which plays on our feeling brains. Ultimately, Manson, in a fairly well put together structure, is arguing that we must strive not to hope for a better future - to make ourselves feel better - but constantly be engaging our rational, thinking brains to work and actually achieve a better present. It must be said that his concluding chapter, in which he advocates for AI being the positive discovery that could save humanity, seemed a little out of place in relation to the rest of the book, not to mention that he (purposely or not), exactly contradicts the central thesis of his entire book by hoping for a future where AI is our religion. 3.5 stars because he makes too many bold statements about spiritual religions without having enough knowledge about any of them, often using Christianity - with which he personally had a bad experience - to pass judgements about the nature of all the others, and because, his overall argument seems a little flawed in places. A recommended read though nonetheless, leaving you with plenty of food for thought."

Manson's writing starts off charmingly conversational but eventually starts to grate on you, like a cross between some teen WIDPSC competitor's persuasive speech and a long winded Reddit textpost on r/seduction. His ideas were either an repackaging of other philosophers with nonsensical Words and Metaphors He Capitalised (with the glorification of Nietzsche and Kant) or reckless assertions. I'm not opposed to this style in and of itself (Wait but Why is fantastic, and I like Manson's blog well enough), but in book form it becomes tedious very fast. True, there were some interesting points, but its a bad sign when you skip to the bibliography and get excited because you find out there are 70 pages less pages to read. I did like the bizarre 'robot overlords' twist at the end though, which was so left field I had to laugh.1.5*"

Because that is the sum up of this read.This book was less about psychological studies and more about interesting philosophies and ideas. Manson grabbed a bunch from Nietzsche and Plato. He also dug into their life and who they really were which was interesting.It had interesting idea's about the world and where we've come and where we're going. Artificial intelligence is an exciting yet scary thing. You can easily create your own religion because they're basically all the same.Instead of flying cars we got twitter. It's because what we think we really want is sometimes not actually what we really want, there's other things that are important that we didn't realize.There's the left side and right side of your brain, for feelings and emotions and the other for logic and reason. They both have to live in harmony with each other, you can't ignore your feelings.Don't strive for happiness, strive for pain and suffering and you'll be happier. This food for thought was kinda like - expect the worst so that you'll never be disappointed.Talked a lot about how it's human to have hope and faith but having hope is always wishing for something greater, and you will never be fulfilled.Basically robots will take over at the end of the day, you can either like being controlled by robots or you may not. This basically sums up this novel. Oh, and you will be easily brainwashed into any sort of religion if you are down in the dumps - that is childish dictator’s dream come true.

Tal como o livro anterior de Mark Manson - ""A arte subtil de dizer que se f*da"", este livro é muito fácil de ler e traz-me uma certa satisfação por estar recheado de pontos de vista ""não tradicionais"".A primeira parte, intitulada ""Esperança"", não me conquistou. Foi difícil perceber o fio condutor do pensamento do autor, o que fez com que muitas vezes parecesse que estava a ler ideias soltas. Na segunda parte, porém, tudo se alinhou. Gostei muito da perspetiva que o autor tem sobre a dor (capítulo 7: ""A Dor É a Constante Universal"") e com certeza que irei levar algumas das suas ideias comigo. Também gostei da conclusão deste livro e de como tudo se conectou, acabando por me fazer refletir bastante. Mais uma vez, Mark Manson fundamenta muito bem os seus argumentos com uma pesquisa teórica sólida. Adorei que este livro trouxe ciência, filosofia, marketing e história de uma maneira leve e interessante. Só achei que as notas foram demasiado extensas e por vezes desnecessárias. "

I happen to share a lot of the same views as the author and I also happen to really like his writing style. The extra details on sociology were a big plus for me too.That being said, I think I lost him right around the end of the book. All was going well, until the excitement sky-rocketed and AI technology was taking over the world and that was a good thing apparently. And sure, I mean, why the hell not? It's never been done before, we don't know that it will suck any more than any other phase humanity went through in the past. But the writing got a little funky, and I must say, it left me just a tad bit let down. A slightly forced sum up to an otherwise nice book. I would still definitely recommend it!"
262,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/165833149-prinz,Rating 3 out of 5,"Mark Manson has really good points, but I feel he really seems to be trying too hard to convey his points in a way that muddies up his point. I wish it was properly written. The author makes a strong point that it is important to get out of hope, but just be better. He also goes on to say that the problem is with us, and we are the ones messing things up. Eventually, he looks forward to the day when AI starts ruling us all.Overall, there are points that I can agree with, and points that are based on the author’s own cynicism and skepticism. Often he throws in a line that is so arbitrary and without explanation, that I often went “Whoa, what?”This isn’t a book about Hope, but rather to not have any hopes. So have no hope about this book. Maybe you might like it. For me, 3 stars is good."

I think the stronger parts of the book were the various studies and references to philosophers that the author incorporated. If you don't know much about philosophy, this tries to give an introductory approach to some more in depth topics. I'm not sure how much you'd get out of this if you're a philosophy buff though.I do have to add, Manson lost me a bit when he would take examples from extreme historic tragedies and try to relate that to our current, more mundane lives. I know he was just trying to say some attention-grabbing stuff, but it didn't always come off the way I think he wanted it to. Felt a little manipulative on his end in those cases.Overall, this was a mixed bag for me personally. I'm not mad that I read it, but I am glad I got it from the library."

Unlike with his previous book where he has a personal experience of moving towards developing values and choosing his path, he has less of a personal connection to the subject. As a consequence, the lack of citations stands out as he aimlessly drafts from hand picked stories and studies and formulates a broad set of ideas that are neither linear nor coherent. Read nitzche or kant or the stoics and one will arrive at the same conclusions as he did. He is trying to answer the unanswerable question of hope in ways people have done better in the past. His novel approach to the first book, 6 years later from the first, and read by me 6 years after he wrote, is less striking and his thesis that the emotional brain is in charge and needs to feel meaningful does not land as well as it did in the first book. he best ideas are borrowed in the book: ""treated everyone as if they were an end and not a means to an end"" -Kant To take on the role of arbiter is not what humanity was to be, love what is in the moment, good and bad (amorfati) and you will find happiness - Nietzche This review may seem harsh, and maybe it is reactionary, but I saw a clear lack of humility in this book which was present in the first. Ultimately the book was longer, more aimless, and smarmy and is not worth reading, unlike the first book. Also his techno rant about ai at the end was a little unhinged. Who is it for?"

It doesn't have the same charm as the first one, and it just feels like the author is regurgitating information from other people in his own voice. What I loved about the first one was that it was really all him. This one feels a bit like an analysis of already exisiting theories that have enlightened the author in some way, and he's trying to convice his readers to also see how they are enlightening. Nothing wrong with that, but my expectations after the first book were pretty high! Maybe the second half of the book delivers more of his charm and unique voice, but I'm not very interested to find out."

The bits about distractions, and always wanting to feel a 10 ion the happiness scale. Also the part about what real trauma and true suffering is which is more than just words. He hits some good points that I’ll keep with me.I get that people today should be sensitive to others feelings but others should also get a tougher skin. It works both ways. There are ppl who really have suffered horribly. I need to remember this for me as well. How we chase the high of always seeking happiness. We need to stop and just be.

The introduction uses an example of a Polish man who resisted the Nazis. Who was then killed by the Nazis.

If you enjoyed his first book, this one certainly continues in the same manner but delves into another whole realm of topics. I’m not sure if I’m supposed to feel more or less hopeful by the end, (especially when the author seems to logically debunk any and all means to which we construct hope, which for me having a correct understanding of the Gospel solves), but my brain is spinning with thoughts on it all."

Or maybe it is? Who knows? I was excited and HOPEFUL that this book was THE BOOK. I don’t know what the heck I was looking for in this book-HOPE? As he realistically explained HOPE, it made me view it differently his way and not the positive way anymore as I was taught by parents, schools, society, religions, and more. Well,...good luck reading it. I’m going to go outside now, because that’s even better than the book. "

I haven’t really read any self help books previously to compare this too (which is probably a good thing!) but I would imagine this one is unique among the majority. Mark Manson’s tell-it-like-it-is tone and dark humor made this an entertaining read to say the least. He does a good job at referencing historical events and relating them to modern situations. Also, he makes effective points by taking philosophical ideas and modifying them to fit the meanings and examples of modern issues and struggles. There were points in this book that felt as if he was ranting or going off on a tangent. Perhaps I didn’t try hard enough to make sense of what these rants meant in relation to the rest of the text. Some of the self-help passages seems a bit redundant or pessimistic. But there were certainly ideas gained and historical facts learned that made this a valuable read for me.P.s. his info and thoughts on AI at the end felt somewhat unrelated to the rest of the book but also kind of blew my mind.

It was basically like hey everything is going to end with us being controlled by AI so we might as well be good people. He basically ripped apart todays society saying that people will fall behind any cause because they feel like they need a community. A lot of the stuff he was saying was true, but I didn't feel up lifted after finishing it. I felt sad about the world out look. Also I felt like he wanted to make more money so he put out another book. 5/10 would recommend to anyone that spends way to much time on their phone and wants to change their out look. Wouldn't recommend to anyone that is religious, looking for a light-hearted read, is complacent and happy."

I'm not going to tell you what this book is about, because I think you should read it for yourself. I found myself thinking and wondering more than I had in a long while. Any book that does that is already successful in my eyes.The writing style was amongst my favourite aspects of this book. If I were to describe it, I would say it be 'academic informal'. While it took a rather academic approach, subtle acts of humour was incorporated throughout which I wasn't mad at. It gave the book a more lighthearted feel despite the book consisting of some rather heavy topics. The chapters occasionally felt like they lacked connection with one another, especially with the chosen layout Mason decided to approach it with. However, the ideas flowed well and each one held importance of what it added to the book. I think there is something for anyone in this book, whether it be a small sentence or the entire argument at hand. Whether you enjoy Manson's work or not. The ideas and issues that are brought up in Everything is f*cked are heavy and explained well. The ending especially left me with something to think about for a long time. "

The book perfectly illustrates the reasons behind the way we act by describing how our perceptions, morals, and beliefs influence our actions. The reason this book changed my life forever is because it changed the way I behave since it gave me a new foresight of what the world could be if we act the way the book wants us to do. The book ultimately wants us to enjoy everyday of our lives and do good in a world where its so easy to do bad. I would recommend this book to people 13 or older since it has swearing in it. "

That does not mean that I do not think that this book is without it's faults. It is not as cohesive as I would have preferred. The book starts off with a thesis of what it will deliver and ends with a . . .well I can't really deliver any of that just wait for the AI apocalypse. I found human nature to be a bit too simplified. The talk of the emotional brain versus the logical brain is a very simplified way of looking at human perception, and then he kept lumping it into mental health without actually making any links.I like the way that the book made me think about things outside of the book, more than I liked the book itself. However, I also think that is a positive of the book. I do plan on going back and reading Manson's first book. "

It raises uncomfortable questions about the plights of humanity through a broad discussion of philosophy, psychology, history, and current events. Ultimately, this book altered many of my perceptions about myself and the world around me. It has sparked within me an urge to learn more about the human condition and the internal influences that have plagued civilization for millennia, as well as the direction in which we’re headed. "

This one ultimately seems designed for the subset of people who believe their gym habit is the most important work they could be doing. Good for them. Despite the title, it’s kind of a book against the concept of hope. It���s fine and it was about a 60/40 split on when i found it insightful vs annoying.I wonder if the storygraph has a trigger warning for a mention of Elon musk bc i really don’t want to ever read another word about that guy again in my life."

A wide range of topics are discussed from how to create your own religion to how our future will be ruled by AI and the connection between these topics is unclear.

He is obviously well-read, great at marketing and has found a niche gaining attention for generally decent ideas. I found myself feeling very inspired at times before being worried that some of the simplified philosophy and advice might be as manipulative as the religious and marketing tactics he complains so much about. Like most self-help, his commentary just needs to be taken with a grain of salt."

294,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26634103-annie,Rating 4 out of 5,"So this book went from a 1 star rating to 4 star one. When I started it, I couldn't stomach the language and the disdainful way that the topics were presented. And it also felt like all the ideas were just copied from other best selling books. But as I went on, I had to grudgingly accept that it was all presented in a thought provoking way and the book did a great job in pushing us to think differently - to challenge our our preconceived biases and views on living.I have added some notes below, it's not a review but just some reminders on some of the major chapters from the book. The uncomfortable truth of life - In authors words 'One day you and everyone you love will die. Beyond a small group of ppl and an extremely short amount of time, little of what you say or do will ever matter. This is the uncomfortable truth of life. And everything you think or do is but an elaborate avoidance of it. We are inconsequential cosmic dust, bumping and milling about on a tiny blue speck. We imagine our own importance. We invent our purpose - we are nothing.The opposite of happiness is hopelessness, an endless gray horizon of resignation and indifference. It's the belief that everything is fucked, sp why do anything at all? It is the root of anxiety, mental illness and depression. It is the source of all misery and the cause of all addiction. Chronic anxiety is a crisis of hope, it's the fear of a failed future. Depression is a crisis of hope, its the belief in a meaningless future.Self control is an illusion - People who lose ability to feel emotions (foe e.g. after brain surgery) end up with very poor decision making. Unlike what we have been told to think, we need more than the rational brain to make good decisions and actions. The author says we have 2 brains - a thinking brain and the feeling brain. unlike what we assume, it's the feeling brain that's driving our consciousness car (or our mind). To make us feel good about ourselves, the thinking brain develops a tendency to draw maps explaining or justifying where the feeling brain decides it already wants to go. This is called the self-serving bias.Newtons laws of emotion - For Every Action, There Is an Equal and Opposite Emotional Reaction - When someone causes us pain, our feeling brain summons up emotions to motivate us to equalise.Our self worth equals the sum of our emotions over time - But what if we can't equalise? We will make ourselves think we deserved that (good or bad)Your identity will stay your identity till a new experience acts against it - We hold on our narratives and it feels natural to us. We will stay like this till there is an incident that tears away these assumptions and challenges us to face the uncomfortable truth of life.The formula for humanity - Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.Pain is the universal constant - Blue dot effect - The better things get, the more we perceive threats where there are none, and the more upset we become. This is the heart of the paradox of progress. The more we look for threats, the more we will see them, regardless of how safe or comfortable our environment actually is. The effect is everywhere, it affects all perceptions and judgements. Everything adapts and shapes itself to mild dissatisfaction.Regardless of our external circumstances, we live in a constant state of mild-but-not-fully-satifying happiness. Things are pretty much always fine, but they could also be better. We assume that we are the universal constant in our own experiences. Som days are good, some are bad but we remain the same. But truth is - pain the universal constant in life. No matter how sunny the skies get, our minds will imagine just enough clouds to be disappointed. This is the hedonic treadmill - we run and run chasing our imagined 10 but always end up with a 7. As soon as your life improves, our expectations shift and you are back to feeling mildly dissatisfied again.The antifragile system - whereas a fragile system breaks down and a robust system resits change, the antifragile system gains from stressors and external pressures. As an example using the human body, if we welcome pain and actively workout then our body becomes antifragile and it gets stronger the more stress you put on it. Don't avoid pain, welcome it. use it to gain strength and resilience.Everything you do, everything you are, everything you care about is a reflection of this choice: your relationships, health, work, emotional stability, your integrity, your engagement with your community, the breadth of your life experiences, the depth of your self confidence and courage, your ability to respect and trust and forgive and appreciate and listen and learn and have compassion.If any of these things are fragile in your life, it's because you have chosen to avoid pain.Meditation is a good practice of antifragility. The feelings economy - The world runs on feelings. Real freedom in life comes from self-limitation.It comes from commitments, the things in your life that you have chosen to sacrifice."

If you are looking for a Lil motivation and inspiring words that push you to do your best and reflect the better person in you, then sorry bro this book is not a good choice. As the writer himself has written:""Look, it may be that you came to this book looking for some sort of hope, an assurance that things will get better—do this, that, and the other things and everything will improve. I'm sorry. I don't have that kind of answer for you."" Although, it will give you the proper understanding of the word ""Hope"" and that will somehow unexpectedly motivate you. And for me, this book has taught me a lot of things, like yea, A LOT OF THINGS. As it contains some info about history, philosophy, psychology, biology, business, technology, and many more. I was disappointed at first about 'what the book turned out to be.' (Coz I wanted a self-help book, ofc) But the knowledge I gathered from this book can also not be denied. So, I'm giving it 3 stars."
