And if this is the case—which to some extent it surely is—then by studying evolutionary biology and psychology, along with modern hunter-gatherer groups, we can gain some insights on the roots of many of our physical, mental, and social problems. Then, and only then, can we begin to reevaluate some of our behaviors to better align with our nature and our history, thus resolving many otherwise intractable problems. This, in a nutshell, is the argument and purpose of the book. The problem, of course, is how far you’re willing to take this argument. It’s one thing to concede that evolution gives us certain predispositions (e.g., the compulsion to binge eat) that no longer match environmental realities (an overabundance of sugary foods), leading to disastrous consequences (obesity, heart disease, etc.), and that by understanding the mismatch, we can modify our behaviors (whole food diets, intermittent fasting, etc.), leading to better outcomes. Few reasonable people would argue against these more clear-cut cases.But the authors don’t stop there. They want to take the argument further and claim that all long-standing cultural adaptations “evolve to serve the genome” (and they really mean this). This tactic, however, seems little more than using genetics and evolution to support the beliefs and practices approved by the authors. If every long-lasting cultural practice can be said to support the genome, then those practices can be defended on seemingly scientific grounds. But this is nothing more than an illusion, and should be recognized as such by the reader. It’s not necessarily useful to think of humans in this way. Humanity separated itself from the rest of the animal kingdom primarily via our ability to transcend genetic determination and to decide how to live using reason and experience. And if a cultural practice is bad for the genes but good for the individual, to hell with the genes. The classic example is contraception. This long-running practice of enjoying sex without bearing children cannot have “evolved to serve the genome,” and yet those who practice it by intentionally not having children are not living an impoverished or defective life in any sense simply because their genes may not like it. If reason tells you that you would prefer a child-free life, then that’s what you should do, irrespective of what your genome would tell you. Similarly, in many matters, evolutionary biology offers us no help whatsoever in making life choices; rather, philosophy becomes far more important. But the authors want to pretend that every aspect of our lives can be guided by evolutionary logic when in reality they’re simply using a particular reading of evolution to justify their own beliefs (don’t watch porn, have casual sex, or take medication). Readers should be able to see through this ruse pretty easily, I would hope. So take the content for what it’s worth. As I said above, there’s much to learn about our evolutionary past, which can provide deep insights into how we can modify our behavior for the better. But don’t think that evolutionary logic can make all the decisions for us, or that our own reason and capacity for independent philosophical thought cannot or should not override what may or may not be “best” for our genes, or for whatever traditional practices justify themselves on the basis of longevity alone (a bullshit argument often used by conservatives or religious fundamentalists).

2,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/129301624-spen-cer,Rating 2 out of 5,"To say that I was disappointed when I finally got this book after preordering it would be a vast understatement. This book had so much potential to be an interesting and scientific trip through how our evolution leads us to be who we are today. Instead what I found was a lot of unsubstantiated correlation based thinking. Especially when it came to medicine and food. It seems like if the authors had their way we wouldn’t do anything advanced until knowing every possible parameter, which is just not possible or realistic. Also a note for the audiobook is that they should not have narrated their own book. There are a lot of great audiobook voice actors and they are not among them. I managed to slog through 75% of this book and while it gets 2 stars for chapters 2 and 3 the rest is just untenable. Take this review for what you may, but this will be one that I’ll be returning to audible. "
3,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22009196-antigone,Rating 3 out of 5,"Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein are evolutionary biologists. They are a married couple and taught as professors for many years. Their ongoing studies of evolution and adaptation have brought them invitations to speak around the globe. As we read through this, their first book, we come to understand they spend a lot of time trekking through various sparsely-inhabited regions and communing with a variety of cultures. As such, they are particularly well-suited to discuss humans from a species standpoint, and how we fare (or falter) in the adjustments our societies tend to ask of us.Topics covered here include medicine (there's far too much of it), sleep (far too little and poorly regulated), food (largely misunderstood), parenting (overly comparative), and culture (heavy on novelty, short on tradition). Each chapter ends with a feature they've titled The Corrective Lens which serves as a thumbnail advisory for alterations the reader might choose to make, or at least keep in mind.I thought this whole approach was a terrific idea. And timely, too, as we finally imagine cracking open our doors to step out from what has essentially amounted to a world-wide lockdown. Years have passed. Thoughts have been formulated, reckonings made. Change is in the air. It felt like a fine point for me to chisel down to the fundamentals. Only, as it turns out, there was more than that going on here.About a third of the way through the book, its tone began to creep into mission-speak. There emerged an assertion that there was a right way to live and a sadly ignorant one, a clear set of choices and an obvious set of mistakes. Science became what religion so often becomes, a clique composed of those walking a superior path. And maybe I'm just a little sensitive to that sort of assertion these days. And maybe Heather and Bret have spent a little too much time in those jungles to get a keen sense of what their modern-day readers have been up against. Tone's a critical matter now, whether one likes it or not.Let's just say, by the time they got around to suggesting we could have avoided this pandemic altogether had we only pitched tents in our backyards? I was not in the mood to hear it.Fortunate for my authors, they saved this to their Afterword."
4,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book loosely weaves together some legit evolutionary science with angry manifestos and personal opinions. The epigenetic link between culture and genetics, which much of the book is built upon, is poorly explained. They interpret this emerging science ina way that is convenient for the worldview they are trying to expound. The first few chapters are interesting and stick closer to evolutionary theory. From about chapter 4 and on the book starts to feel more like propaganda. Somewhat convincing because they use lots of fancy science words and come off as real hoity toity intellectual types, but their arguments begin to feel more loose and strained Should be noted that the authors are taking ivermectin and doing a right wing media tour to promote their ideas, a pretty telling sign of the underlying politics that cloud real evolutionary science."
5,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37226659-amara,Rating 5 out of 5,The amount of times in the last couple of months that I've checked my pre-order to see when this releases is absurd. I'm on the edge of my seat in excitement.
6,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83095784-yasir-sultani,Rating 1 out of 5,"All the good bits are old and all the new bits are not that good. I highly recommend reading the following review since it says every thing I want to say and more with much more authority and style( link ).Ok it seems I have to add some of my own dislike here.1. Book is titled "" A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide"" but the justifications the authors provide for most claims are anecdotal . It is either about them or their children or some other combination of their family.2. B & H were professors at a third rate college and both of them have very little original work to their name . In fact it seems they haven't really kept up with the literature since a lot of their arguments are based on some sort of hyper-adaptationism. 3. Bret in particular pushes for criticizing pharmaceuticals based on his theory . He believes lab mice have longer telomeres and this renders them more resistant to drug toxicity. Thus, since they are used for human pharmaceutical research we can not be sure which drugs are potentially toxic to humans. Bret also thinks he should have received a noble prize for this claim and that his idea was stolen ( He is wrong on all counts as detailed  here  ) . I should also mention that B & H don't actually mention all of this in their book but we need this context to make sense of their advice in regards to fluorides in water , sunscreen etc etc.Edited to include more links to a diverse range of people and their reactions to this book:Review by biologist PZ Myers:  (ignore Myers petty takes, just focus on his critique of the ideas) Review in Areomagazine:  Lengthy but well worth the read Related but not about the book. Jerry Coyne calling out Weinstein on his bullshit:  Jerry Coyne is probably 10 times the biologist Weinstein thinks he is "
7,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/565363-mark,Rating 1 out of 5,"Very disappointed. Official DNF.Okay, this bothered me so much I had to expand on this review. Here it is:The messiah complex is a state of mind in which a person believes they are the savior of the world. Usually the person can be found on a street corner or a soapbox. Or in a treehouse.The Bookis titled A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century, co-authored by a middle-aged married couple. Both of whom earned PhDs in Biology and recently resigned teaching positions from a liberal college in the Northwest. ""They cohost weekly livestreams of the DarkHorse podcast."" The podcast is shot in what looks like a backyard treehouse.When I learned of the book I preordered it. I am a proponent of Evolutionary Psychology and an author, too. I was very much looking forward to reading it. It sounded like something right in my own backyard.DNFis book-speak for ""did not finish"". I couldn't - it was that bad. However, I don't disagree with the major premise - that we humans evolved in a world that is much different than the one we have created. And that we are therefore ""mismatched"" to it. Ironically, or of a paradox as the authors purport.But by page 90, I'd had enough. Though I did skim the rest. The writing is redundant, pompous, poorly constructed and the thinking magical. The authors like to make up words, principles, rules, and concepts, then pretend they're doing ""science"".There are boxes at the end of most chapters wherein they list remedies, or instructions / rules, to ""guide"" the reader toward survival. They call the lists ""The Corrective Lens"". In fact there are 103 of these corrections. The implication being if you follow these instructions you'll correct the mess we've made.The Writingand story telling is awful. They mix metaphors, stories, philosophies. Repeat themselves. It reminded me of children I used to counsel in residential treatment. Six, seven, eight-year olds with their nonsensical yammering. Kids in a tree house using their imaginations to construct a make believe world.Examplesare so numerous you can open to any page and find them. Why use mutual when you can use ""mutualistic""? Did you know that fire is ""abiotic""? Why be precise when you can flood the page with maybes, probably's, suggests, mights, may have been's, almost's, etc. and so on. And commas, oh my word. Blah,blah, blah, and yada, yada.Did I want to turn the page and keep reading? Nope. That defines bad writing and 'did not finish'.The Noble Savagemyth is the belief that those people - the ""natives"" who we white folk killed, enslaved, conquered and oppressed - had it right. And yet, almost in the same sentence, Heying and Weinstein deny they are romanticizing that lifestyle and belief. The authors label us (readers of the book) WEIRD.WEIRD stands for Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, Democratic. It's one of the authors' clever (?) inventions. What they mean is: English speaking white people, with some college, living with indoor plumbing and full-time electricity, adequate income, and voting rights.That's hardly a majority of people living in the ""West"". Even in the US! Yet, here's another one of their favorite paradoxes: we are killing ourselves. With all our convenience. We are too soft and too clean. Furthermore, we live in square buildings with ""carpentered corners""! And those corners prevent us from seeing the world as it is.This book is amazing. At least so far in the 21st Century, 2021. The worst year ever? What's truly amazing is that it's gotten any traction at all. Moreover, some high praise from some pretty smart people (Sebastian Junger for one).Seems like the magical (crooked) thinking of kids in a treehouse works. Robert Wright takes exception. Calling the Weinsteins ""crackpot"". I agree with Mr. Wright. Skip this one. Try these: Set Yourself Free: Twelve Books to Read on Human Nature in stead."
8,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25056631-liene,Rating 1 out of 5,"Is it me, am I the problem? Because this was torture. Long ramblings about philosophy, psychology, sociology and any other kind of –ology you can name that seemed a bit too subjective to be scientific. Paragraph after paragraph about animals (there’s nothing wrong with literature about animals, but I was promised a book about humans, so I wasn’t particularly interested in swans and their sex lives). Also, what’s with all the personal stories? They might have seemed cute for the authors, but I really don’t care about their life-changing trips to the jungle or their son. Not to mention that all of this was presented with such a know-it-all and holier-than-thou tone that made the book extremely irritating (for instance, the chapter on parenting, the way people do it – wrong, authors’ way – yes, you guessed it, the right one). Ah, must be wonderful to have all the answers. "
9,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109739055-petros,Rating 2 out of 5,"I was looking forward to this book (I pre-ordered it and started reading it just a couple of days after it arrived). I like the authors, have listened to a number of episodes of their podcast and have watched a number of interviews of Weinstein in previous years. So I really wanted to like this book, but it was a disappointment.My main issue is that I don’t think this book is well-argued. It is clear the authors have good intentions (for the betterment of society and individuals) but the book seems more like a collection of opinions/assertions rather than anything resembling rigorous argumentation.For instance: there is the claim that sleep evolved because eyes can’t be excellent at both seeing in the day and in the night. But we know that organisms like the worm c elegans also sleep and they don’t have eyes (and it is almost certain our most recent common ancestor didn’t have eyes either, so the hypothesis of sleep evolving due to trade-offs relating to eye function doesn’t seem reasonable).Sometimes there were not even enough details to understand a point. For instance: there is the claim that, in animals with breeding seasons (as opposed to animals who, like humans, can be fertile year-round), it is easier for a single male to monopolize the reproduction of several females. No explanation is given as to why, and I can see an equally (if not more) valid argument for the contrary: if all females ovulate at the same time a single male should have a harder time to control and mate with all of them.Considering the above, I felt that even some factual claims might be suspect. For instance this claim: “an octopus can die in contact with her hatching eggs, thereby handing over the nutrition of her own body to her hungry offspring.” Now, I love octopi but I hadn’t heard of this fact. As the book offered no reference for it, I tried looking it up online but was unable to find any information that supported it (on the contrary, all relevant information I found seemed incompatible to it). Some other statements seemed cryptic to me (e.g. “[human] software is the interplay of experience and knowledge with capacity”; I definitely think this statement required additional explaining for its meaning to be clarified).Another point I found particularly surprising... in the chapters about sexual behavior (which do offer some interesting food for thought), the authors describe three possible “reproductive strategies”: pair-bonding, forced reproduction (i.e. rape) and free/consensual sex without commitment. They consider the third opinion to be “junk sex, formulaic and without depth”; this is an opinion they provided some arguments for (through their “evolutionary lens”), so it is a position the reader is free to find convincing or unconvincing (I think their analysis is narrow, overlooking alternative points of view that could also have merit). But later on they write: “...if you are a man engaging in reproductive strategy two or three, it does not benefit you to fall in love. While reprehensible, these strategies have been effective for men throughout history...”. So consensual sex without commitment is reprehensible; I think that’s blatant moralizing and crosses a line of good taste (and is also counterproductive if the authors want to change the minds of people who don’t already agree with their opinion).The book does have some interesting thoughts to offer: their culture vs consciousness analysis (although the authors define consciousness very differently than the term is commonly used: according to their definition an octopus doesn’t have consciousness), the chapters on child upbringing and education (very interesting ideas which I wholeheartedly agree with; although, still, not that well-argued for) and their analysis of addiction as reward vs opportunity cost (with boredom signifying zero opportunity cost) have some merit. But even those are generally not that well explored (mostly offered as opinions).In general: the book contains some interesting and/or thought-provoking ideas (regardless of whether one agrees with them or not), but too often there are generalities, claims are offered without adequate argumentation (some claims seem suspect of being “just-so stories”), mechanisms are not explored to a deep level and possible counter-arguments are generally not addressed. I wanted to like it but, as it turns out, I don’t think I gained much from it."

In the book, Bret & Heather argue that the modern world is out of sync with our evolutionary biology. For example, we evolved to live in small tribes. But many of us live in cities and don't even know our neighbor's names.It's a fascinating book!Five stars."
11,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/101170806-tyler-gish,Rating 1 out of 5,"I wanted to give this book a better review, perhaps a solid 2-stars, for some fun interesting facts and perspectives inside. However, so much of this book is stinky doo doo, and I would not want anyone to use their free time reading that much stinky doo doo. I once heard a saying which went like this, ""a little poop in the pudding makes the whole pudding poopy"", well there is a lot of poop in this pudding."
12,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21239546-benjamin-krishna,Rating 2 out of 5,"The whole book feels poorly thought through. The authors clearly have particular views on issues like GM food, casual sex, sleep patterns and water fluoridation. They then cherry pick scientific studies to support their beliefs and move on without properly considering the literature. It’s a self help book with a sciencey veneer."
13,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102290345-brian-sachetta,Rating 4 out of 5,"I’ve enjoyed listening to Bret on the Joe Rogan Experience over the years, and I’ve dabbled in his (and Heather’s) podcast as of late as well. Both he and Heather are great thinkers and scientists, and they present things in a straightforward and practical way. That’s why I decided to grab this title.Overall, I thought it was pretty good. It’s got a similar vibe to their “DarkHorse” podcast in terms of its pragmatic and scientific approach.The basic structure of the book is this: take a subject (say, sleep, for instance), discuss its evolutionary purpose, talk about what helps or harms it, then make some recommendations on it. For example, when it comes to sleep, the pair says we should reduce our use of blue-light-emitting devices, sleep in dark, cold rooms, and be careful not to consume caffeine within eight hours of going to bed.Though some of the conclusions they draw are ones you may have heard before, it’s the evolution-based science that makes such findings interesting and drives them home; this book isn’t just a “do this, don’t do that” guide — it’s also a thoughtful explanation as to why we should or shouldn’t act in specific ways.There’s no doubt in my mind that implementing the ideas in this one would improve one’s quality of life overall. The only reason I’m going four stars is that the book does, at times, feel overly academic or like it could use a little more excitement. An extra story here or there would’ve helped tremendously. The science is great, but it does get a tad dry at times.-Brian SachettaAuthor of “Get Out of Your Head”"
14,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1283603-ryan-somma,Rating 1 out of 5,"This is philosophy masquerading as scientific thought. The author's assert that floride in water is bad because it's not natural; nevermind the decades of hard scientific evidence showing otherwise. The authors say we should trust cultural norms that have been around for a long time because they must have evolutionary advantages, except when the authors disagree with the long-standing norms of other cultures, like infant-swaddling--then it's a bad thing. Authoritative parenting is bad because it coddles children, and then they describe the ideal parenting style... which is a perfect description of authoritative parenting. I could go on and on, but I learned long ago not to waste my time on pseudoscience."
15,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43941809-luke-spooner,Rating 1 out of 5,"I hate this book.I stumbled upon it on Overdrive and seeing as I teach evolutionary biology, the themes really appealed to me.However, it is much more self help than any kind of piece of science writing. Most of the points are reinforced by anecdotes or analogies and very little actual data. Being evolutionary biologists does not make them any sort of authority on parenting or managing relationships. Further, being evolutionary biologists does not also mean they are experts in education, pharmaceuticals, or medicine in general.Basically, all their points boil down to one argument: in the span of evolutionary time urbanization and industrialization are pretty new and some of the aspects of these processes could be bad but we do not know which ones are, so avoid as many as possible. Therefore, they are against fluoride, screens (sleep outside), vaccines, plastic, porn, vitamins, gmo's, surgeries, dating apps, wearing casts for the requisite amount of time, people transitioning, and the list goes on. This argument is simple and harmful, and does nothing to reflect the overall scientific consensus that refutes it.The main problem with all of this is that the book is very well written and very readable, and they do a good job of making basic evobio principles interesting (speaking from experience this is tough to do). I later found that these two frequent the Joe Rogan, Bill Maher circuits, promoting ivermectin and discouraging people from receiving mRNA based vaccines. It checks out, they're good at communicating and their good at nonsense.I would give it a half a star if I could."
16,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104090874-omar,Rating 3 out of 5,"A pop science book by a husband-wife duo that bridges evolutionary science with the challenges of the modern world. The authors write that the rate of change is so rapid now that our brains, bodies, and social systems are perpetually out of sync and that our species is essentially in danger of destroying itself and the world. The book’s aim then is to navigate these terrains through first principles reasoned thinking through an evolutionary lens in this age of hyper-novelty in order to move forward in a logical manner that’s best for the survival of our species. The tone is a bit on the alarmist and preachy side of things, and the propositions often times reflects their own personal philosophy and familial values-- for better or worse. Some of the reviewers here are also claiming that the science isn’t up to date or accurate, which doesn’t come as a surprise if you’re familiar with Bret’s recent history. Despite it’s issues, it’s still a decent read for the layman to think about the currents and trends that are challenging/changing us in a very readable way. 2.5/5"
17,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90291855-michael-setford,Rating 5 out of 5,"Society needs this book: perhaps most importantly because it presents an evolutionarily-based model for understanding our species in all domains, as well as a toolkit for determining how we should best move forward together. To get the most out of this book—if you do not already have a science background—it is imperative that you approach it with an open, yet healthily critical, mind, as the authors do an excellent job explaining complicated evolutionary phenomena for the lay ear. The most controversial idea, that culture ultimately exists to serve the genes, is not fundamentally controversial: though, it sounds an awful lot like social Darwinism to those who are not paying attention. To combat this misunderstanding, Bret and Heather kindly provide the Omega principal, which states that in order for an observable trait to be adaptive, it must satisfy three criteria: (1) it is complex, (2) it has energetic or material costs, which vary between individuals, and (3) it has persistence over evolutionary time. Therefore, many phenomena within culture, such as religion, can be interpreted as adaptive as they are complex, expensive, and increase survival rates among individuals who practice them. Moreover, many religious beliefs are literally false but metaphorically true—meaning those who behave as if such stories within religion are true prosper and their genes move forward in time at rates higher than those who do not. If it were maladaptive, those who practiced religion would have experience differential success against this who didn’t that dwindled to zero. In addition to this important idea, the authors provide other useful models for interpreting information in our age of hyper-novelty. Chestertons fence and the precautionary principle in particular provide one with a safeguard against making myopic decisions based on short-term vision. As a species, we are running out of time. We are destroying our planet and wasting resources at an extraordinary rate with seemingly no plan to fix it. At base, the authors argue, this is a problem of cornocopianism: essentially a faulty viewpoint characterized by a misguided belief that because resources seem abundant now, they will always be so. Interestingly, I found many parallels between this book and Jordan Petersons beyond order, in that they both share a central philosophy that dichotomizes order and chaos. In this book, Heather and Bret unpack culture vs consciousness, which is essentially similar in structure to order vs chaos. Culture, or tradition, is a culmination of ideas and behaviors that persist over time. Consciousness is a mechanism used to amend anachronistic traits that no longer benefit those practicing them. This idea can be extrapolated to the political realm, for example with regard to conservative vs liberal ideology. In general, this mechanism exists to maintain homeostasis. It is extremely important, perhaps more than ever, that humanity recognizes this. Overall, this book is an absolute gem and I couldn’t find many things I disagreed with. Congratulations Bret and Heather!-Michael Whetsel Setford"

Every single paragraph is deliciously loaded with lateral thinking - of things we know, deep down. I'm so happy they finally wrote this book!!!"
19,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76105804-rick-wilson,Rating 2 out of 5,"I picked this up hoping for a meal, and instead got a big serving of junk food. Great claims require great evidence. This book has many of the former but little of the latter. So, starting with the fact that I agree at a high level with a lot of the things the authors have to say here, I did not think this was a very good book.The model of “we are hunter gatherers in the world beyond comprehension.” Is one that I regularly think of. It blows my mind that I travel daily in a box at speeds my ancestors only could reach by jumping off a cliff. I genuinely think a lot of first world problems stem from living in a world of abundance while running firmware that is predicated on scarcity. The authors share these opinions and more. And I do think I would probably enjoy dinner with the authors. However, when writing a book, assuming that your audience agrees with all your points doesn’t work. And the glaring issues in this book make it an extremely frustrating read even if you do agree with most of the points. This book is an aggregation of dubiously sourced counterfactual aphorisms about modern life. While interesting, many of the ideas contained will contradict each other, and no one idea is explored enough in depth to convincingly sway anyone who doesn’t already agree with it. This results in a sort of schizophrenic leap from concept to concept wherein the authors give condescending prescriptive advice about things as far ranging as nutrition, child rearing, healthy relationships, and the importance of bonfires. One of the first chapters talks about the ill fittingness of our bodies and minds in modern society. Sitting for hours a day while over consuming carbohydrates and social media. But the support for that information is just assumed. An arm wave into “these are not the droids you are looking for” is not evidence that there are no droids. The whole book follows this trend. Occasionally pointing to personal anecdotes, vague studies, and sometimes just eschewing evidence altogether. It’s like showing up to a talk where there was a handout with all the supporting evidence, except you didn’t get the handout. So the authors discuss “brain old, society new” and the danger of that. While in the following chapter discussing the overconfidence of medicine, and to support their claim, they dredge up a personal antidote where the author‘s kid breaks their hand and heals organically without the use of pesky modern casts. Naturally, they write this with a straight face while talking about shooting spacefaring x-rays and other imaging into the appendage before the doctor exclaims at the miracle of natural healing to validate the supremacy of their point about natural healing. And to repeat, I mostly agree. Not all modern medicine is good. Up until just a few decades ago our best Psychologists were descended from the Freudian tree of thought and would gather around in their trench coats (assuming on the apparel here) to discuss the wonderful enlightenment that lobotomies bring to their patients.“Good sir, I do believe that man is fascinated with his own genitalia as a result of how his mother fed him too many bananas.” “Very good, we shall never attribute human motivations to anything but sex” “Yea verily” “Interesting that you say Verily. How suspiciously close to the word ‘virile’ perhaps YOU have some latent sexual desires to uncover” “Why you!” *muffled sounds of one Psychoanalyst choking the other in an Oedipic rage….And again, this skepticism is probably for a good reason. If the recent pervasiveness of the opioid crisis is any indication, it is good to continue to be skeptical of physicians bearing gifts. BUT THE AUTHORS DONT BACK UP ANY OF THEIR @#$%^%$ CLAIMS. How did this pass any sort of editor? And that leads me to the second major issue with this book. There is absolutely no nuance or accounting for counterfactuals. Every statement is definitive. Every point is uncalibrated. If someone in JV High School Debate tried this they would be lampooned by every other JV HS debater misquoting Kant or the Social Contract. I mean, to claim that a single chapter or two comprehensively covers any of the expansive subjects they claim to cover is not only ridiculous, it seems harmful to peoples health. It’s all fun and games to make wild claims, but Steve Jobs died because he valued natural healing over listening to a doctor. There is a tremendous amount of confidence in boldly presented ideas where that does not seem to be appropriate. And so much of the book follows this trajectory, there’s a lot of folksy, anecdotal, emotional arguments towards the ability or inability of some group or another to accurately show our “true nature as hunter gatherers” depending on what side of things the authors choose to portray. There’s an assumed reasonableness that really isn’t warranted, and much of the advice comes off as prescriptive when it seems like it should be presented more akin to a smoke sesh on a faded futon amongst undergrads. What’s lacking from this book that I think someone like Robert Sapolsky does really well is to calibration of how accurate the statements being made likely are. At one point the authors talked about how laugh tracks were responsible for falsifying human connection to such an extent that the disintegration of modern society could be pointed to from that.

That example can, and should, be made fun of, laugh track or not.At another point, theres a digression about how parents should not take photos of their kids to ""allow them to change."" How does anyone see this as anything more than ""Old man yells at cloud?""And while those are amusing, where we get into trouble is when we venture into the murkier waters. Like I said above, I agree with the authors on a lot of the basics, but what this book fails to give is any sort of information on where their ideas come from, and as such it’s near impossible to disentangle the nonsense from the reasonable assumptions I picked this up with the understanding that this was supposed to be a scientific book. Both the authors have PhD’s. And their folksy aphorisms probably play well to the undergrads they teach. But under any sort of critical lens, most of the claims couldn’t withstand a soft breeze on a summer day. I found myself looking up supporting evidence for points made in the book AND I AGREE WITH THE POINTS. I’m not particularly looking to blow holes in the side of my own belief system. But at least when I get high and talk about gut microbiomes or the prevalence of inflammation in modern life, I try to use actual evidence to back up the reasonability of those claims."
20,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"Disappointing Pseudo-Science: polarizing opinions guising as facts of biology.As an Archaeology and Anthropology graduate, I was disappointed by this book. This title may appear like it should sit on the ancient history, popular science, or even smart thinking shelf, or that it is a good recommendation for those who enjoyed Sapiens: this could not be further from the case. The book is better shelved next to David Ike. Heying and Weinstein resigned from academia during the 2017 Evergreen college protests, under what might be considered controversial circumstances. They are biologists by profession, studying frogs and bats respectively. They use the social standing of their professorships to give credibility to their work, yet throughout the book undermine academia and those who engage with it, effectively undermining their own authority. It would be nice if people knew exactly what they were buying. I expected a scientific book, not an opinion piece. While I understand this is not an academic essay, it would not pass a peer review process in the state that this finished title finds itself without serious editing.The title is confusing, as the writers don't have any real foundation of knowledge about hunter-gatherers past or present. Their anecdotes of times spent in Central and South America - studying dart frogs, not human prehistory - offer up their own opinions on the people who they met there. However, they poise these opinions as facts, often making generalisations and unsubstantiated claims: one example is that a singular experience in a Nicaraguan market leads to readers to asses that "" we have just gotten a view into some traditional gender norms, one in which women are viewed as the property as men "" without any further exploration or explanation. Their experience in cultures other than their own are filtered through the lenses of white, educated, western people and yet there is little acknowledgment of their own point of view. The authors seem to have a distain for who they refer to as 'weird WEIRD' (p.114) people (WEIRD is an acronym for Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic used in psychology). They use WEIRD as a pejorative term to undermine the options of others they don't agree wit throughout the book , even though they belong to this demographic themselves. The anecdotes don't seem to serve much point by way of argument, and read in a way which very much 'others' the cultures they claim to have been immersing themselves in. Othering was very prominent in early anthropological texts whose authors were white, western men, who saw anything different to their own culture as a 'exotic' or deviant 'other'. Heyings and Weinsteins experiences echo such outdated texts.Each chapter starts with an anecdote, followed by onion, followed by suggestions for a improving the modern human life. The text flips between informality, and at times lazy writings, to using extremely scientific jargon which would leave the general reader confused: is this jargon meant to prove to the reader that the author is telling the truth and only dealing in facts? If not, the constant reiteration of "" all of that is true. All of these explanations are true"" (p.108) might convince you... just.The chapter on 'sex and gender' in particular has some disturbing statements. There are some obvious biases at play in this book, and I would urge readers to question the motives of statements such as:""women are more likely to have anxiety disorder"" (p.109). Their argument is that there is a biological basis for anxiety and that women are more predisposed to it. However, medicine is not simply biological, it is also social: given that people practice medicine, define illness, and make diagnoses of other people. I would be inclined to question this statement, are women really biologically more anxious, or are they more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety disorder. See "" unwell women"" for a social history of medical myth and misogyny.""Until recently women have preferred long-term partners to one-night stands (p.118)"""" the final alternative male {reproductive} strategy, however is not honourable or desirable for society and yet has been encouraged for women by ""sex positive"" activists as a sign of freedom... one-night stands... if women adopting some of the worst traits of men is our evidence of equality and freedom, we need to reinvestigate our values"" (p.118).""when people of both sexes are routinely seeking frivolous, no-emotional-connection sex, they are creating conditions in which everyone is behaving like men at their (second) worst"" (p.119)""porn, we posit, produces what we call sexual autism"" (p.120).""For straight women: do not succumb to the social pressure to embrace easy sex"" (p.121)""Children's claims to be the sex that they are not should [therefore] not be indulged as anything beyond normal play and searching for boundaries. While actually intersex individuals are real and incredibly rare, and actually transgender people are also real and very rare, much of modern 'gender ideology' is dangerous and contagious"" (p.122).""in several species of frogs, there is an established relationship between exposure to common environmental contaminants... and an increase in hermaphroditic individuals... we will not be surprised if it turns out that some of the modern confusion around sex and gender ends up attributable to widespread. endocrine disrupters in our environment"". (p.122).By 122 pages I was tired of being compared to frogs, alligators, birds, and moose.Did not finish."
21,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81083913-jessica,Rating 5 out of 5,"A lot of what is in this book is common sense to me but it seems that it's not common sense to every one. After reading the chapters on parenting and childhood, I actually went and thanked my mom for allowing me to go to funerals, play with friends on my own, and grow and learn by suffering the consequences of my actions. She encouraged me to go outside and tromp through the woods and get injured and solve my own problems and she trusted me to ask for help when I needed. It was almost like she read those chapters herself before raising me. Of course that is impossible. But now, even as I'm typing this, I realize the problem is that what was common sense when I was growing up is no longer common sense today. In less than 40 years, everything about raising children has changed. We are no longer interested in raising children that can become happy adults who are functioning members of society capable of solving problems. We are interested in keeping kids safe, in a protective cocoon that makes them think that they are the center of the universe, which leads to dissatisfied adults who aren't really adults at all. How could that happen so quickly? That is one of the questions Heather and Bret address in this book.The last chapter is a bit scary. I've read similar warnings from other authors. What is new for me to think about is the American obsession with growth. It's been at the back of my mind before but I've always pushed it away as an uncomfortable thought to worry about later. They also mention crises that I have thought a lot about, like a Carrington Event, or a nuclear event, either of which could take out society as we know it. Of course, it's obvious to most intelligent people that the status quo is unsustainable. That's why people like Elon Musk want humans to go to Mars. Heather and Bret lay out some ideas that do not require going to Mars, but I don't know if our society is capable of accomplishing them without some major catalyst occurring first. In any case, wouldn't it be nice to have more than one plan in place?"

This is more ancestrally consistent to how humans lived 10,000+ years ago. Polygyny may have been beneficial especial for women practicing fast mating strategies- if you purposefully confuse paternity, more men and women will team up together to raise kids. This is even easier when practicing mainly polygamy- there is an essential endless supply of sperm and several females to help raise children. Nuclear, monogamous families are a modern concept spearheaded by the need for guaranteed paternity in passing down of property, finance, etc.This is an argument coming from a woman who has absolutely no desire to be with a polygamous/polyandrous partner.https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/arti...Heying and Weinstein refer to a study talking about the Big 5 traits and rank women as more agreeable, altruistic, and extroverted. However, this study doesn’t look into whether this pattern is created by normal biological nature or whether it is created by nurture. In families, girls are often expected to take care of their younger siblings- something that is less required of older male siblings. From a young age, women are taught to be nurturing and agreeable. As such, women end up doing more emotional labor in families as adults and even in the workplace. These are traits that can be cultivated by men provided they are also forced to perform this level of emotional labor within families.Beyond this, Big 5 tests are also known for their acquiescence bias- especially in developing populations. Personality test responses in general reflect what a person wants to be vs who they actually are. Self response personality tests are fundamentally non empirical forms of psychological analysis and evidence. So are women naturally more agreeable, extroverted, nurturing, and neurotic or are are we just inclined to believe that these traits are desirable and marks of womanhood? https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/bl...https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-ins...Heying and Weinstein also discuss the variability hypothesis as though it is biology that dictates IQ and representation amongst top performers in STEM fields.

These two academic refugees from a great idea turned racket (Evergreen College) are wonderful teachers. They are the professors we all wished we had experienced and their love/passion for their subject is clear with every chapter of this book. They tell the story of human development to modern day through the lens of practically experienced evolutionary biologists. They start with the beginning of life and proceed through our development including civilization, culture, medicine, food, sleep, sex and gender, parenthood, childhood and school. It is a holistic interpretation of what humans are evolutionarily as well as how our current reductionist thinking is in direct opposition to the evolutionary process. Every open-minded reader will gain something from this book.The ending is a bit fatalist/Malthusian from my point of view. However, it does not detract from the insights gained from the first 13 chapters. After reading it, I will exercise and sleep more, eat better and be more social (maybe). In the audiobook, I would have preferred hearing the conclusion from Heather's comforting voice instead of Bret's cautionary one. No spoilers here - read the book. You'll be glad you did."
24,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35643641-andr-s-astudillo,Rating 5 out of 5,"I really want to thank the authors for having written this marvelous book.I want to explain something. Human biology has been constructed in a natural effort that took millions of years of contrivance, so, biological evolution takes a really, really long time. Our brains are a product of biological evolution, thus our behavior as well. This is explained by -evolutionary psychology-. On the other hand, cultural and technological evolution develops and is transmited way faster than biological evolution. Technology is new. The first electrical plant was announced in 1881. Electrical wiring is not even 200 years old. Cultural evolution, also includes patters such as development of fast food, media development, and almost everything that surrounds us, including politics.This is the part in which the book takes place. We are beings worth a million year's time using technology that evolves so fast, that both our evolutionary biology and psychology cannot keep up. It just can't.Let's mention one simple example. Obesity.Being fat is not a healthy thing as opossed to what progressives say. NO, BEING MORBID IS NOT A GOOD THING. We have walked, jumped, ran, and sweat for hundred thousand years in order to survive. Sitting 8 hours a day, or watching Netflix while eating Doritos is not a natural scenario. Sedentarism was not the rule, the rule was to keep always moving, saving ourselves from predators, running for protection, finding and killing animals or climbing trees for food. Another example.Light, LED light and electrical wiring.We are diurnal animals. Ever since dinosaurs dissappeared, our common ancestor stopped living on those tree branches and started to crawl or move in plain daylight - from that moment on, we became diurnal animals- we need to sleep, and the natural scenario was total darkness; just your small tribe and the moon light. Later on, some people used fire to lighten a bit the environment and tell stories, origin stories. What is it that we have now? LED lights even when we got to sleep. There's biochemistry here -melatonin and the circadian cycle-. That is the way our body senses that light is diminishing in the environment (red shift in physics) and our brain prepares itself to sleep. So, a problem of our new world is that we have become desperately in need of cellphone even when we are going to sleep, meaning that our sleeping cycle fucks itself up.There are several reasons why we are getting sick in this modern world. We need to understand our biology and our evolutionary psychology to correctly live in this world, if we really wanna keep doing that.They also talked a lot about my country Ecuador, and that was really amazing. They mentioned the Earthquake, Quito, Pedernales and the Amazon.The most important thing is that the book content is real, so postmodernists will rate this book as 1 star, because they might feel offended or sad. Too bad."

They can certainly string well worded sentences together and present information within their field of study, but after diving in for about an hour something felt really off. Although they were presenting a broad picture of evolution and where we are today, their opinions and beliefs structures starting leaking through. They interjected their prescriptions of what we need to do in order to avoid doom. I both agreed and disagreed with some of their ‘recommendations’, but the fact that opinion was interjected into the book makes it lose credibility. Presenting a book as an academic work then trying to sell your personal beliefs within isn’t good. Authors should have picked a genre and left the sale of their beliefs out of this text. If they had it would have been a whole different experience. Note: I had no idea who the authors were when reading the book.

If you have a thing for indigenous ingenuity, this is the kind of book that will make you giddy with delight. To me, on the other hand, it sounds like celebrity name dropping. But that doesn't change the unique wonder of listening to folksy scientists working to popularize deep and consequential ideas that are generally only obliquely referenced by actual hack celebrities. Their approach to evolutionary biology is methodological and yes a bit simplified for the reader but substantial nonetheless. What I have come to see is their counterweight using the Precautionary Principle to David Deutsch's open-ended infinity [stone] approach to applying knowledge to life. Where Deutsch is a die-hard epistemologist who asserts that the human mind will achieve all, Heying and Weinstein see how 'we moderns' have managed, after a virtual infinity of evolutionary years, to get a whole lot wrong. Knowledge is not only created, but destroyed. This book reminds us of how much we arbitrarily destroy for the sake of modern convenience. If you come to this book looking for their last word on COVID vaccines and such, don't bother. It's in the appendix or the afterword. It's no big reveal. The point is rather that you come to understand their thinking process. There are no cheat codes. There are mysteries about why, when most of us only want what and sometimes how. The team shines most in their retelling of parenting stories. If you've ever sat in school and dreaded the idea of one or both of your parents being schoolteachers, they will relieve you of such fears. They are the absolute opposite of helicopter parents and understand something deeply important about what a child knows and how he is supposed to learn. This is marvelous because it is without a doubt the most important job any of us are likely to have. For that alone, I cannot recommend this enough.On the other hand, as the book draws to its conclusion, there is more than a whiff of Malthus in the air. I would have expected them to have a better grip on economic theory, but they clearly do not. They do understand that we are rats in an urban rat race, and from the POV of the rat, they do excellent work. But they fall short in their understanding of what can be properly engineered and evolved in institutions and systems. That should come as no surprise given their horrid treatment at the cowardly hands of Evergreen students, staff and leadership. At the individual level they are right on target, and they also understand the dynamism of complex systems. Yet they make the error of suggesting that controlling for the single variable of sustainability will deliver us from evil. Nope. I'm glad I read the book. I will refer back to it. I will also continue listening to the podcast. They are both excellent teachers at ground level. "

31,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27609802-david-quijano,Rating 2 out of 5,"My thoughts on using hunter-gatherers as a guide to better living in the modern world are mixed. On one hand, I am inherently skeptical of people claiming we should live like hunter-gatherers. Some branches of humanity stopped being hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago. That’s a lot of time to evolve. On the other hand, there are many recent changes in the modern world that seem to have completely disrupted our traditional way of life. It is one thing to switch from being a hunter-gatherer to farming over several generations. It is a much bigger change to go from farming to sitting in front of a computer for eight hours a day with zero physical activity within two or three generations. And that is just one change. There are probably dozens of changes from food, sex, physical activity, etc. that have all changed dramatically within the last 80 or so years. Many of our modern problems (obesity, diabetes, autoimmune disorders, drug abuse, suicide, etc.) are new or are on scales so much larger than in the past, that they are likely caused by some of the trappings of modern life.So when I first saw A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century by Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying on Joe Rogan’s Instagram, the title caught my attention immediately. I have previously been exposed to Weinstein’s work from Rogan’s podcast and my general impression is that he is someone I don’t particularly agree with, but is kind of an interesting dude. I knew that he was a biologist and his wife and coauthor was an evolutionary biologist. I know they are both liberal-ish and secular, so what I hoped to get out of this book was some science-based advice on how to overcome the various ways that modern life disrupts human existence. Although this book isn’t bad, it is a mere introduction to the idea that the modern human lifestyles is often in direct opposition to the way we evolved and it lacked the depth and originality I was hoping for.What really drew me to this book was a clip of the authors on Mikhaila Peterson’s podcast where they talked about dating strategies. This is a subject that interests me and I found their take (pro-monogamy) interesting, considering the fact that they were secular. The clip made me recall a book I read a few years ago titled, Sex at Dawn. In that book, the authors describe the sexual practices of various ape species as well as the recorded sexual practices of various hunter-gatherer groups (some historic and some who still exist as hunter-gatherers to this day). The message of the book, though flawed in some parts, was pretty clear: for most of human history our sex was non-monogamous, but also not with random people. The issue with looking to hunter-gatherers for any information regarding modern day life is obvious: we are no longer hunter-gatherers. We live in a totally different environment now compared to the vast majority of our evolution. Not to mention, considerable genetic evolution has occurred since we stopped being hunter-gatherers.So yes, we evolved having lots of sex with various people in our tribes. But unlike today, they weren’t random people from the internet. They weren’t people who would abandon you if you got pregnant. They were close friends who cared about you. Friends with benefits might sound fun, and the appeal of it makes sense because it is how we evolved. But the reality of hunter-gatherer sexual arrangements is much less appealing. A small tribe where sex is mostly free and and the father of any given child isn’t known means that no one knows who is related and how. This means that the sex arrangements in hunter-gatherer groups that some portray as utopian because of fewer sexual taboos was actually just one disgusting incestual orgy. This is where the whole application to modern day life falls apart as this sort of sexual arrangement violates widely accepted taboos regarding sex.I bring all this up because sex is a great example of the follies of trying to apply hunter-gatherer practices to the modern world, and the authors do a good job at explaining this fact in various ways. For one, there was no monolithic experience for hunter-gatherers. The most obvious examples are probably diet and culture. Diet was dependent on your tribe’s environment and cultures vary widely depending on many factors.Unfortunately, this also means the kind of advice one might hope to get from a book like this does not exist. It is even possible that it cannot exist. We cannot possibly know how all the various hunter-gatherer groups lived. Even if we did, we wouldn’t know which groups we descended from. And even if somehow, a person was able to properly identify all the hunter-gatherer groups they descended from and all their various practices, you still wouldn’t know which practices to follow. If a person descended from Inuits and Ethiopians, which diet should they follow? Which clothing will react better to your skin? Does any of this actually matter or is any perceived benefit in our heads?My hope with A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century was that I would have a few key takeaways on better living in the modern world. Instead, the authors really focused on presenting ways for individuals to analyze their lives and find better ways for themselves. On one hand, I appreciate this approach. No author is going to have all the answers about modern living inside of hunter-gatherer bodies. So an intellectual framework for people to discover things for themselves makes a lot of sense. On the other hand, I felt like this book was mostly underwhelming with very little to offer in terms of actionable information.One perfect example of the underwhelming amount of information was the question of diet. I get it, diet is very complicated. You could easily write multiple books on the question of the evolution of the human diet and how best a person could optimize their diet to fit their genetics. But the author’s main advice seemed to be to follow the traditional diet that your ancestors ate, be skeptical of GMOs, and listen to your body. This is not bad advice, but it also isn’t particularly detailed. They mention off-hand that maybe the perceived issues with wheat has to do more with modern wheat and that maybe an older, non-GMO versions of wheat would be more suitable for more people. This is an idea I was interested in, but they didn’t elaborate. It is the perfect example of what disappointed me in this book. It really isn’t the fault of the book, but my expectations. Rather than reading a book that tells you everything about how humans should adapt to the modern world, you will have to read a dozen books that cover each subject individually: diet, sex, relationships, community, clothing, sleep, etc. There is just no way to fit all of this information into one book. The one thing I came away thinking was that it would actually make a great podcast series with each episode being about a specific subject with a guest that is an expert on that issue. There’s just too much info to cover otherwise.I wouldn��t particularly recommend this book. The one thing it does is get you thinking about all the various ways that the modern world messes with our wellbeing. This book might be a good starting point to explore these questions, but you won’t find much in-depth or actionable information here. I would generally recommend that if you are interested in a given subject, to just read a book by an expert or two on that one issue. You will get much more information that way. I give this book two stars."
32,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7193120-aussiescribbler-aussiescribbler,Rating 5 out of 5,"The challenges which face us as a species are legion. What should we do?First we have to know who we are and where we are. We need to understand our programming and the ways in which it interfaces with the world around us, both its natural elements and those we have constructed.The central challenge is one of hyper-novelty. Our instincts change extremely slowly and so are still adjusted to the way we were living many thousands of years ago. Culture changes more quickly, but still requires much time to test its innovations. A technological advance can spread throughout the world almost instantaneously, but a culture of social habits which allow it to be used for our net benefit rather than net deficit might take decades. Social media gives a case in point. It has brung us great benefits, but we are struggling to know how to manage downsides such as addiction and toxic forms of social interaction.Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein set out in this book to provide us with tools which we can use to orientate ourselves and begin to improvise strategies for a liveable future.I sometimes become annoyed with people who interpret human psychology with an evolutionary lens. Clearly our psychology exists within the process of evolution, but it sometimes seems as if people will use evolution as an excuse to reduce everything to the question of what does or does not lead to the prospering of the genes. So we are told that people wear ostentatious clothes for the same reason that some species of bird have bright feathers, i.e. it helps to attract a mate. That is all very well as far as it goes, but it doesn’t acknowledge that a post-menopausal woman may wear fancy clothes because it feeds her ego to get attention. The authors talk about rape as a product of evolution - a reprehensible form of reproductive strategy. This makes sense, but the rape of non-impregnable individuals is very common. Men rape other men and they rape prepubescent children. Rape can be an expression of a distortion of the ego which does not confer any benefit on the individual's genes.So it seems to me that, just as culture is nested within and interacts with the system which is the genetic evolution of the species, so the psychology of the individual is nested within genetic evolution and culture, and it would be foolish, in trying to understand it, to reduce it to a role of servant to that larger system. Very often we are not even servants, but rather saboteurs, to ourselves.This is just to give some idea of my own biases. I was not disappointed in the way this book approached the topic of evolutionary psychology. It emphasises the importance of viewing cultural evolution as being in service of genetic evolution. Just as mutations in genes lead to variations which either persist or don’t depending on fitness for life in the environment, culture is a series of experiments (conscious in this case) which lead to changes in society which either prove adaptive or not.If an aspect of culture is costly in effort or resources and persists for a long time, then we can assume that it is adaptive in some way. The authors call this “The Omega Principle”. This doesn’t mean that the content of this cultural form is necessary true. It may be a myth which encourages socially beneficial behaviour. If a tribe believe that anyone who steals will go to Hell, it will probably lead to them being more cohesive and prosperous even if it isn’t true.One of the key influences on this book is G. K. Chesterton. You may get a little sick of just how many times the author’s refer to “Chesterton’s fence,” but it is understandable given what a useful analogy it is. Chesterton pointed out that, if you are walking across a field and you see a fence and you don’t know what the fence is for, it is a really good idea to find out before you tear it down. This is Conservatism 101. Tradition is the wisdom we have inherited. Be careful that any change is going to be in your own best interest.There is an interesting balance between this caution and the authors’ acknowledgement that, at this crisis point of hyper-novelty, we need to prioritise consciousness over culture. Culture is the repository of old solutions and consciousness is what we use to find a new path. I suppose the idea is that we need to learn the lessons from culture in the process of finding a new way.There is plenty of practical advice in the book, grouped in bullet points at the end of each chapter. A lot of it centres around limiting hyper-novelty - processed foods, pharmaceuticals, unnatural light, etc. There is much parenting advice. And a lot about getting out into nature and being more sociable in person. Their argument against watching pornography seems like very sound advice for others, though I won’t be following it myself. I’ll also give spending time in potentially dangerous wild environments a miss for the time being.One part of the book I found very interesting was their comment on the growth in diagnoses of autism and the way they link it to young children being “babysat” by screens. This fits well with what I have read from some other writers and it makes complete sense. I’m curious how it will be received though. In the past, explanations posited for psychological disorders which centred around the behaviour of parents have been very strongly resisted.It’s a book which is very easy to read and full of fascinating information. I never knew that we humans can be usefully thought of as a kind of fish.The final chapter deals with the question of where do we go from here - how do we secure ourselves a future. The key insight is that we need to find a psychologically satisfying alternative to material growth. We need to be exploring and utilising a new frontier - “The Fourth Frontier” - because it won’t satisfy us to stagnate without adventure. It has to be something other than maximising our exploitation of the Earth’s resources in the service of an increasing population and its indulgence. It’s a fuzzy picture, but I suppose it has to be. It can’t be someone’s planned utopia. It has to be something emergent from the interactions of us all. Thus it can’t be knowable in advance.I also highly recommend the authors' Dark Horse podcast."
33,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5857342-don,Rating 4 out of 5,"Winner of the 2021 Huzzah Award This book’s overriding idea is simple and sensible: we evolved in primitive hunter-gatherer societies and would do well to remember this. If there’s a problem in modern life (e.g., we don’t tend to sleep well), it’s worth considering what was different in our ancestral environment (blue lights ceased after sunset) and making appropriate changes (for only $48 you can get Aviator BluBlocker Sunglasses from Amazon). So this book has the right idea, and I find Heying and Weinstein to be trustworthy guides. Several negative reviews of the book can be found on GoodReads, and I find some of them pretty wrong-headed. One reviewer, for instance, accuses the authors of stating that every long-standing cultural practice is adaptive. “If every long-lasting cultural practice can be said to support the genome,” this reviewer writes, “then those practices can be defended on seemingly scientific grounds. But this is nothing more than an illusion, and should be recognized as such by the reader.” Agreed, but this is clearly a straw-man argument, as the authors state that just because something is a cultural adaptation “does not, of course, mean that” it is “inherently good, for individuals or for society or that the conditions that rendered it adaptive in the past haven’t changed, rendering it neutral or maladaptive now.” Some negative reviews, on the other hand, make points that I think are reasonable. One reviewer writes, “About a third of the way through the book, its tone began to creep into mission-speak. There emerged an assertion that there was a right way to live and a sadly ignorant one, a clear set of choices and an obvious set of mistakes.” That’s a fair point, and this book should obviously be considered one voice in this important debate and by no means the final word."

Some of this change has been wildly positive, but hardly all, and other changes appear positive but have consequences so devastating that, once discovered, we struggle even to conceptualize them. All of this has encouraged the postindustrial, high-tech, progress-oriented culture we live in now. This culture, we propose, partially explains our collective troubles, from political unrest to widespread failing health and broken social systems...""A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century was a mixed bag. There was plenty of great writing and content here, but not without some points of contention from me. I'll cover the ""good"" first, before getting to the ""bad"". This review will be a long one, so if you're not interested, just scroll down to the bottom for a summary. The authors drop the above quote in the book's intro.Authors Bret Weinstein and Heather E. Heying are married. They are both evolutionary biologists, as well as hosts of the DarkHorse Podcast. They came to national attention following the Evergreen State College protests of 2017, where they were effectively railroaded out of their jobs by a ""woke"" mob. More on that here, for those interested.
Bret Weinstein and Heather E. Heying:


The book gets off on a good foot, with a well-written introduction. The authors lay out the scope to be covered, as well as provide the reader with some background. They write with a matter-of-fact and straightforward style, and the book is very readable. It also is presented with decent formatting; the writing is segmented into chapters, each chapter with relevant headers at the top. There is also a summary titled ""The Corrective Lens"" at the end of every chapter. Super-effective communication. The audiobook version I have was also read by the authors; a nice touch that I always appreciate. They take turns reading the chapters here. Off to a good start so far!The writing in the book proper is a very detailed introduction to evolutionary biology. The scope of the book is quite broad, and at times the material presented is very dense. It might be a good idea for potential readers of this book to be at least somewhat scientifically literate before starting this one, as there is much jargon employed throughout.They drop this interesting tidbit early on:
""Recall the Omega principle, which points out that any expensive and long-lasting cultural traits should be presumed to be adaptive, and that adaptive elements of culture are not independent of genes.""
They also drop this super-interesting quote about culture:
""Culture we define as beliefs and practices that are shared and passed between members of a population. These beliefs are often literally false, metaphorically true, implying that they result in increased fitness if one acts as if they are true despite the fact that they are either inaccurate or unfalsifiable. Culture is a special mode of transmission because it can be passed horizontally, rendering cultural evolution immensely faster and more nimble than genetic evolution. This also renders culture noisy in the short term, before new ideas have endured the test of time. Longstanding features of culture, by contrast, constitute an efficient packaging of proven patterns. Culture can spread horizontally, but its consequential parts are ultimately passed vertically, from generation to generation. Culture is received wisdom, generally handed to you by ancestors, and efficiently transmitted.""
Despite being a legitimate field of inquiry, evolutionary biology has run afoul of leftist ideologues and other assorted ideologically anchored proponents of postmodernism and Tabula rasa (or ""blank slate"") philosophy. The authors mention this a few times throughout. Campus Marxists have been waging war against evolutionary biology since at least the mid 60's. Biologist E.O. Wilson ran afoul of some of these Marxists, including Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin. He talks about this in his book, Naturalist. Wilson was even physically assaulted during a talk on his new field of science called ""Sociobiology."" _____ Now on to the ""bad"": Despite most of the writing here being very well-done, and the book being super-interesting, some points need to be deducted for their openly hostile stance on GMOs. The authors even go as far as to advise people to ""avoid GMOs."" This is especially ironic, considering that there is a section in the book right at the same point where they caution against reductionism. They say: 
""Avoid GMOs.""""...Given this track record of reductionist science and health advice, should we trust that GMOs are safe, just because those who would profit from their acceptance, either intellectually or financially, tell us they are? We suggest not. Are some GMOs safe? Almost certainly. Are all GMOs safe? Almost certainly not. How will we know which are which, and can we rely on those who have created them to be vigilant on our behalf? Until we know the answer to those last questions, the Precautionary principle suggests steering clear.""
GMOs are the most studied biotech ever. We have been altering genes in labs with precision for almost 40 years, since 1982, when the FDA approved the first consumer GMO product developed through genetic engineering: human insulin to treat diabetes. How long should we employ a precautionary principle, when large numbers of people in the world are literally starving to death? Is providing diabetics with cheap, high-quality insulin something that should ""be avoided""?? The writing here is pushing hard on first-world elitism. There is zero evidence of any harm to end consumers of this food, ever. In 2014, Forbes published a summary of the ""Trillion Meal Study."" They said:
""Writing in the Journal of Animal Science, in the most comprehensive study of GMOs and food ever conducted, University of California-Davis Department of Animal Science geneticist Alison Van Eenennaam and research assistant Amy E. Young reviewed 29 years of livestock productivity and health data from both before and after the introduction of genetically engineered animal feed. The field data represented more than 100 billion animals covering a period before 1996 when animal feed was 100% non-GMO, and after its introduction when it jumped to 90% and more. The documentation included the records of animals examined pre and post mortem, as ill cattle cannot be approved for meat.What did they find? That GM feed is safe and nutritionally equivalent to non-GMO feed. There was no indication of any unusual trends in the health of animals since 1996 when GMO crops were first harvested. Considering the size of the dataset, it can reasonably be said that the debate over the impact of GE feed on animal health is closed: there is zero extraordinary impact...""
GMO crops also use less pesticides, yield more, reduce co2 emissions from reduced mechanical working of the soil, and provide better, more consistent products that consumers love and demand.Also - we have been genetically modifying all our food for ~10,000 years now with artificial selection; producing organisms that would have never been ""naturally"" selected for. An unknown number of genes, as well as genetic changes, are produced using this method. We have also been irradiating crops to produce desirable mutations, with no understanding of the genetic impacts. They don't seem to be opposed to these forms of GM, however, for reasons unexplained, but likely related to the naturalistic fallacy.I expected better from two biologists, to be honest. The world's population will soon reach 9-10 billion people, and conventional agriculture will not be able to feed that number of people alone. Vaclav Smil concluded that only about half the current world population can be supported without the Haber-Bosch process for artificial nitrogen fixation, for example. Engineering food to yield more, be more resistant to pests, as well as environmental conditions is a no-brainer. We use technology to improve every other aspect of our lives, why would we not bring this force to bear for our food production, as well??Also missing from this book are some of the advantages GM foods can offer to the consumer: better taste, and a more consistent, aesthetically pleasing, nutritious product, that is often better for the environment than its conventional counterparts. Consider Golden Rice, which was engineered to produce vitamin A. Much of the world suffers from vitamin A deficiency, which can lead to childhood blindness. Imagine being opposed to something that can prevent millions of poor children from unnecessary blindness...This stance also doesn't help the scientifically illiterate ease their fears of a technology they don't understand, and is necessary to feed the planet's 7+ billion inhabitants.Finally, and most importantly, there is a scientific consensus on GMOs: ""Genetically engineered crops currently available to the public pose no greater health risks or environmental concerns than their non-engineered counterparts.""The talk here reeks of neo-Malthusianism, to be blunt.On a related note, let's go back to the quote at the start of this review. It continues on, ending with ""it's killing us..."" 
""...The best, most all-encompassing way to describe our world is hyper-novel. As we will show throughout the book, humans are extraordinarily well adapted to, and equipped for, change. But the rate of change itself is so rapid now that our brains, bodies, and social systems are perpetually out of sync. For millions of years we lived among friends and extended family, but today many people don’t even know their neighbors’ names. Some of the most fundamental truths—like the fact of two sexes—are increasingly dismissed as lies. The cognitive dissonance spawned by trying to live in a society that is changing faster than we can accommodate is turning us into people who cannot fend for ourselves. Simply put, it’s killing us...""
~This is both hyperbolic, and demonstrably false. While the thesis of the book about ever-evolving technological advances fighting against our slow-moving biology is a super-interesting one that I would largely agree with, the data do not reflect the assertion that this change is ""killing us."" Quite the opposite, actually. Both the number of people in the world, as well as their average life expectancy continue to rise, as do almost any other broad-based metric used to measure human quality of life. Metrics reflecting violence, poverty, and other human misery follow a similar, but inverse curve. See Steven Pinker's The Better Angels of Our Nature: for more on this.The authors also drop a very brief and unconvincing argument about the origins of autism. This thesis is not expanded upon further after this paragraph:
""Why is there an uptick in diagnoses on the autism spectrum now?36 We posit that it is, in part, related to the number of children who were raised staring into screens animated with creatures that seemed to be alive but weren’t. Those seemingly alive creatures, which cannot and therefore will not respond to a child’s looks or gestures or questions, send the message to the developing brain that the world is not an emotionally responsive place. What is a child to make of this world? How is a child to develop a nuanced theory of mind—the ability to attribute mental states to others, and to understand that others can and do have desires and opinions that are different from one’s own?""
For those interested, psychiatrist Norman Doidge covers autism in his ground-breaking book The Brain That Changes Itself, where he includes a very interesting argument for the biological causes of autism. He ties it (partly) to neural pruning, BDNF, and plasticity. See the book, particularly around page 60 for more on this. The authors close the book with a brief discussion of SARS COVID-19. There is some more somewhat ridiculous writing here, too, unfortunately... They say: ""COVID-19 is a product of technology, no matter what path it took to humans. Consider this fact: from the beginning of the pandemic the virus showed essentially zero capacity to transmit outside. Put another way, COVID-19 is a disease of buildings, cars, ships, trains, and airplanes,"" and ""The COVID-19 pandemic is itself a symptom of another disease entirely. In the pages of this book, we call that disease “hyper-novelty.”I'm not sure where to begin with this... While it is technically true that COVID was spread quickly due to our global society, other historical pandemics were around long before our current age of modernity. Yersinia pestis, the bacteria that caused the Black Plague - killed ~50% of Europe's population long before the industrial revolution. The influenza virus has also existed since possibly long before even people have; wild birds are the natural reservoirs of this virus. All this talk here about the dangers of modernity, ""avoiding"" biotech that has objectively saved millions of lives, and other forms of attacks against technology and societal prosperity, economy, and technological advancement beg the question: 
What the hell do the authors suggest we all do??
 Should we cast off modernity, and go back to the utopian days of dying at 30 from a tooth infection? Should we abandon our climate-controlled homes, the internet, and our safe societies to go back to the good ole' days of subsistence hunter-gathering and cave-dwelling? At times, it sounds like the authors have sympathies for this prescription...They rally here against the capitalist concept of economic growth, and call it unsustainable. However, if you are concerned with the welfare of humans on an aggregate level, you will know that our modern, capitalist societies have produced more inventions, innovations, and have improved the quality of life for more people than any other system of societal organization, ever. This point is conveniently not mentioned by either of the authors (at least from what I recall).Finally; missing from the book is a chapter on exercise. I'm not sure why it was not covered here, as it is germane to the broader thesis of the book. People have never historically been so sedentary, and this lack of activity brings with it a host of health problems; from obesity to heart problems, to increases in pro-inflammatory diseases, including many cancers. I was expecting it to be covered, but it never was. A glaring omission, IMHO.Some more of what is covered in these pages includes:• Beringians• Food; the optimal human diet• Sleep; optimal sleep habits• Sex and gender; gender roles, division of labour, sexual selection• Parenthood and Relationships: advice for raising children. ""Antifragility""• Becoming adults• Conformity; the famous Asch conformity experiments• Religions, and other magical thinking being ""literally false, but metaphorically true""*************************I did enjoy A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century, but it was not without its faults; covered above.Still, there was lots of interesting ground covered here, and I would recommend this one to anyone interested.3 stars."

Tačiau mane glumino kai kurios pačių autorių įžvalgos ir nuomonės, kurias jie bandė remti “evoliucija”. Galbūt čia buvo išbandymas mano liberalioms pažiūroms, nes didelė dalis knygos man atrodė kaip bandymas pateisinti tam tikrus konservatyvius įsitikinimus kaip evoliucijos būtinybę arba pasekmę. Pavyzdžiui, įtariai žiūrėjau į skyrius “Biologinė ir socialinė lytis” ir “Vaikų auginimas ir partnerystės santykiai”. Šiuose skyriuose, bent jau man taip rodėsi, autoriai bandė pagrįsti skirtumus tarp lyčių, teigdami, kad jie evoliuciniai. Man šių skyrių informacija atrodė labai simplistinė, buvo nubraukiama didelė dalis feministinių tyrinėjimų apie lytį, įtvirtinami “biologiniai”, t.y. “natūralūs”, lyčių skirtumai. Atrodė, kad autoriai bando ne pateikti lyties rolę evoliucijos raidoje, o tiesiog patvirtinti savo pačių nuomones apie tai, kad moterys yra švelnios, o vyrai ryžtingi. Po šitų skyrių (jie yra vieni iš pirmųjų), į visą knygą pradėjau žiūrėti įtariai. Į evoliuciją buvo pažvelgta labai paviršutiniškai, fokusuojamasi į detalius faktus, kurių reikalingumas knygoje ne visada yra aiškiai suvokiamas (pvz. itin detalūs kai kurių gyvūnų aprašymai)."

I've given away five copies so far and every person that read it has thanked me for the confidence boost in how to address the world scientifically and with greater insight into our evolutionary history. It goes into the best way to think scientifically by explaining the process of hypothetico-deductive reasoning, the process of scientifically challenging one's beliefs, and the concept of model-building as a way of testing how well our beliefs align with reality.Additionally, it offers deep insight into many areas of our lives and explains how and why the hyper-novelty of 2021 is hurting us, and how we can mitigate the damage, both individually and societally. Tons of insight and fodder for deep thought here, as well as the seeds of many wonderful conversations (ideally around a campfire!).I see that the guy whose Amazon critique they praised on their podcast is prominent here, but am pleased to see the pushback from people who actually did read it. They don't come close to asserting that genes determine everything, which is why literally every chapter contains ways that you can change your behavior and environment to better align yourself with our evolutionary history, as well as going on at great length with suggestions for how to improve parenting, medicine, sleep, diet, and all the other aspects of life under our control -- hardly the behavior of people who think that genes determine everything. Don't let that distortion stop you from reading it, especially if you feel that the rapid pace of constant change is hard for you to navigate. They offer you some practical tools here. Use them."

Apparently evolutionary biologists know absolutely everything, so you should pay attention to everything they tell us. Much of the book consists of lists of what you should and shouldn’t do in regards to such topics as medicine and raising children. They often give personal examples of what they do, and therefore, you should do. They love to tell you how wonderful they are including reading praise that a student gave them regarding their course. Much of what they discuss seems to have little or no scientific backing. The funny thing is they tell you that you should have a healthy skepticism when making decisions, but apparently not in regards to anything they tell you."

I picked up this book from skimming its jacket at the library for a couple seconds, as a last-minute “why not?” kind of decision. Don’t do it! Big flashing caution signs! Proceed at your own risk! The authors are the kind of scientists that make me want to scream into a pillow — selling snake oil under the guise of popular science, and to their credit, highly palatable arguments building off of well-established scientific theories. Where the screaming comes in for me is when they go beyond the pale, claim that all cultural adaptions have ""evolved to serve the genome,” warping what should be objective science into subjective hogwash. It’s pandering, and distorting evolutionary theories to support the beliefs approved by the authors — practices like genetic determinism, Puritanical views on sex, child-rearing, and serial monogamy, and sowing distrust of medicine and vaccines.

Both evolutionary biologists, Heather and Bret explore parts of society which are being affected by hyper-novelty and they discuss mental models (e.g., the Precautionary principle, Chesterton's fence, and metaphorical truths that are literally false) and corrective lenses through which to think about these topics. Their book provides an evolutionary toolkit (rooted in evolutionary biology) that will inform readers how to tackle the challenges of our modern world with knowledge of our ancestry dating back millions of years. They not only delve into hyper-novelty and its effects on sex and gender, childhood, schooling, food, etc., but offer a direction forward towards a solution: namely, a framework informed by the evolutionary toolkit, called the ""fourth frontier"" (since we, as humans, have exhausted the geographic frontier, and realize that the technological and transfer-of-resource frontiers are non-zero-sum games). The fourth frontier, they propose, is a state in which we feel in a state of perpetual growth but are nor participating in a zero-sum game, a state in which we all thrive together.The book is well-researched. Heather and Bret are careful not to make claims that are not rooted in the scientific literature. When they make hypotheses, they make it very clear that they are ideas they are exploring based on the evidence they've gathered from the literature. In other words, this book is clearly written by excellent practicing scientists, but being scientifically literate is not required to understand and enjoy the book.10/10 recommend. "

Straight off it has a strong agenda. Ive long been looking for a book that would take what we know about historical hunter gatherers, although I know there is limited knowledge, and the last of similar populations to give some useful information on how we can live more in line with our nature, so when I saw this pop up on Amazon for pre-order it seemed to fit the bill.. Instead there were long sections talking about all manner of creatures, followed by rants of personal philosophy. I tried so hard but I couldn't waste any more time on this.The fact that right at the beginning it stated that 'factually there's only two genders' (ummm inter-sex people and a long history of transgendered individuals the world over since the beginning of time may disagree....) instantly put me off. How people choose to identify and live their lives is of no concern to others and is not harmful to the wider population. Whether it is harmful to individuals is also none of our business, people get to make their own decisions. It's also very irrelevant to the wider topic.

And very few of the conclusions they draw are ones I disagree with.They give bullet points at the end of each chapter which are fine, but when they try to give a sound explanation of the problems of modernity it all feels quite cursory.Though it has to be said that this book is a great guide to further reading, someone interested in the issues raised here can find great recommendations at the end of the book, allowing them to take an actual deep dive.This book is a decent effort at bringing up important issues, but it's not sufficiently in-depth to be truly groundbreaking."

I've been enjoying the Dark Horse podcast over the past several months as a voice of reason in a time of super strange behavior all over the world -- I don't agree with all of their opinions, but that's what society is all about. Let them voice their opinions, we all throw it in the jar with everyone else's opinions and figure out the best course(s) of action. When in the history of our society has one course of action been the only acceptable course of action (looking at you vaccine mandates)? People have different beliefs and come from different perspectives and we want to cherish those perspectives. We're living in time when you get curb stomped for having the ""wrong"" opinion. That's never a good long term strategy and has shown in the past to get humanity into a lot of trouble. I think we're in for a rough winter ahead.But this book, though. Solid advice in here. Would highly recommend. Also.. I'm not sure how you get into going to the Amazon rainforest as your job, but want to do that for sure."

Gesprekken over het leven, de maatschappij de toekomst, of gewoon om mooie verhalen te delen. Het lezen van dit boek voelt ook als een kampvuur gesprek met de schrijvers. De uiteenlopende onderwerpen worden allemaal aan de hand van verhalen, met de evolutionaire bril op getackeld. Soms wat kort door de bocht maar vaak wel interessante perspectieven. Bijvoorbeeld het Chesterton’s fence idee dat ze vaak aanhalen is leerzaam. “Als er een hek op de weg staat, haal het dan niet weg tot je weet waar het toe dient”, toepasbaar op veel moderne fenomenen, van het verdwijnen van religie tot vervangen van moedermelk. De schrijvers leren je denken in evolutionaire termen zoals trade-offs, Evolutionary stable strategies en fenotype/genotype expressions. Waarom bouwen beschavingen tempels en pyramides terwijl de bevolking niks heeft? Kan het een culturele adaptatie zijn om babybooms te voorkomen in tijden van welvaart?

Hipotezė moksle yra pradžių pradžia tolimesniems tyrimams, bet čia jos tiesiog numetamos ir paliekamos be jokio aiškinimo. Pvz: (netiksli citata) “mūsų hipotezė, kad daugėja vaikų autizmo atvejų, nes jie nuo mažų dienų naudojasi telefonais” BAM. Tokio svorio teiginys be jokio aiškinimo. - auklėjimas: daug dėmesio skiria vaikų auklėjimui XXI a (knygoje tai šalutinė tema), TAČIAU ypatingai jį išskiria savo pavyzdžiu kaip kone tobulu. - medicina: kelis kartus buvo sukritikuota medicina. Pvz autorė atsisakė gerti vaistus nuo ligos (laringitas?) ir džiaugiasi, kad ji praėjo po kelių metų. Kelis kartus paminėjo, kad nereikia gipsuoti lūžio ir tai pritaikė savo sūnui ir jam puikiai sugijo. Tai čia sėkmės atvejis, o ne taisyklė, alio. - psichodeliniai narkotikai: pasisako už tokios argumentais, kad smagu ir didina kūrybiškumą. Tai buvo numesta tiesiog “patarimų” skiltyje be jokio paaiškinimo. Patarimų skiltys šioje knygoje vertos atskiro pranešimo, kaip itin keistos. Bet! Jei rašai apie tokio nevienareikšmiškai visuomenėje priimamo dalyko kaip narkotikai naudą, turi priminti ir žalą vien iš etinės pusės. Knygą priimčiau labai dviprasmiškai.

59,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72211871-thomas-l-nn-hammer,Rating 3 out of 5,"A decent book with a some novel and counter-cultural ideas, however it's hard for me to judge, having listened to hundreds of hours of Bret on various podcasts, thereby mostly iterations of ideas I'm familiar with. I do feel that they're stretching their arguments further than they can really go though. They're constantly criticizing reductionism, but their definition of 'first principle thinking' comes awfully close to being precisely reductive. On the other hand, they're able to go around certain false dichotomies - nature versus nurture for example - showing how these are intertwined processes which cannot be fully separated. Essentially, Bret and Heather are fully operating upon the axiomatic structure which reduces the drive, or the telos, of evolution to genes. Even though they qualify that in various ways, showing how the process is mutually influential, oscillating between the expression of genes, and how environment are activating latent gene structures. That presupposes to a large degree, the interdisciplinary/unified model of science which goes physics -> chemistry -> biology -> psychology etc. I can't yet put my finger on why precisely, but that model is starting to feel increasingly outdated. There is something more mysterious going on, some huge missing piece, elephant in the room, that this conception is unaware of. We have to rethink temporality radically, reintroduce teleology and concepts such as future attractors. Something about history being pulled rather than being emergent. Preferably, show how that too is a false dichotomy. Time might not be a string from a to b, it might rather be some higher dimensional space, in which all points mutually influence every other point. I don't know, but the linear idea is starting to feel off, it has ran its course, arguing evolutionarily is to easy now."

64,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106626747-reagan-faith-waggoner,Rating 4 out of 5,"All in all, a solid book. It was given to me by a friend, and I definitely enjoyed it. At some moments, I was exceedingly annoyed at the tone and resolve of the authors, but at times I very much enjoyed and agreed with their perspectives. I likely will read this book again at some point in the future, and I do believe that it is a very well-written book. The authors, Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein, are married, and it struck me a little weird that they wrote about themselves in third person when employing personal anecdotes throughout the novel. However, I understand and struggle to think of a better method considering both are authors and the first person is illogical. Anyway, enough with that irrelevant rant. The introduction established that the book is aimed at solving human paradoxes without faith. Essentially, why we cry, why we love, why we feel others' emotions, and what makes us different from other living beings all around the world. The authors certainly revere the concept of being human and recognize the uniqueness of our species. Regardless, I couldn't help but mutter to myself, ""good luck"" when they insisted they would provide an evolutionary fact-set that explains human paradoxes without faith. In chapter 1, the authors discussed their worldview regarding Beringia (supposed land bridge between Russia and Alaska) and their belief that many lived there when it melted, faced with the decision to travel east into an unknown land (North America) or return west to previously inhabited land. Further, using this story and others, they insist that humans thrive in groups, and the best groups are those with non-overlapping blind spots. Additionally, they establish one of their major themes, which carries throughout the entire book - homo sapiens are exceptional because we are jacks of all trades and masters as well. Not only are we skilled in a variety of disciplines; we are masters of them as well. Out natural proclivities toward certain skills make us better together. Alone, we have many blindspots and weaknesses. Together, we can benefit from the best everyone has to offer. Another concept introduced in this chapter is the importance of fire. Not only is it vital in the preparation of food, but it also serves as a convergence point of individuals with different experiences, talents, and insights. Fire serves as a bonding place, both in their prehistoric eras and now. This is one phenomenon that shows that our common needs bring us together. *On my own note - fire brings us together and is a convergence point. The LORD often came as fire, in a burning bush. The Lord brings us together.*More on chapter 1 - the authors introduce two major topics that they proceed with throughout the book: consciousness and culture. They insist that we need both, yet there is tension between them. 1) Consciousness: can be communicated; thoughts packaged for exchange. We as humans are aware of others' thoughts and species, moreso than any other species ever. (This is because we are made in the image of God and are special, but the authors don't know that :) Collective consciousness allows us to become better at problem-solving. We are made to work together. 2) Culture: traits shared and passed on from previous generations Another important concept - Sucker's Folly - the tendency to act riskily for short-term gain when long-term is negative. This is certainly VITAL in today's society. We use products and resources constantly for gain without accounting for unknown side effects and issues. More on this in the chapters to come... Continued : What is the human niche? Each species has their niche, but what of humans? Weinstein and Heying assert that the human niche is niche-switching. This is a reinforcement of the earlier principle that humans are very skilled at a wide variety of activities. Philosophically, they insist that ""as our world becomes increasingly complex, though, the need for generalists grows. We need people who know things across domains, and who can make connections between them."" I couldn't agree more, and the vitality of a strong liberal arts education is well-expressed here. The rest of chapter 1 was a bit more irritating for me. As evolutionists, they have to find a meaning or striving point for our lives, but rather than asserting that our sole end is reproduction, they assert that lineal persistence is what is important. Essentially, they are saying that reproduction is not the end, considering parents want thriving children. Their ""omega principle"" is illustrated in the following two maxims: 1) Epigenetic phenomena are evolutionarily superior to genetic phenomena in that they are more readily adaptable. Epigenetic regulators, such as culture, are superior to genes in that they are more flexible and can adapt quicker2) Epigenetic phenomena are downstream of genetics, so ultimately, genetics are in control. Epigenetic regulators evolve to serve the genomeTo back up real quick and define epigenetic, epigenetic = above the genome; used to refer to mechanisms which molecularly regulate the expression of the genome. Over time, this view has shifted from inherited to molecular switches. Essentially, this is the struggle between nature and nurture, to which the authors insist the answer is almost always both. Ok, anyway, I ranted a lot about chapter 1. Onto chapter 2 - Many commonalities are shared by humans. I could list commonalities, but I am sure you are more than capable of considering them yourself. Authors assert that ""our differences are fascinating, but our similarities make us human."" Anyway, author proceeds to list a timeline of evolution ""proven"" by science that looks something like the following - 3.5 billion years ago - life began 2 billion years ago - eukaryotes 600 million years ago - animals500 million years ago - vertebrates380 million years ago - tetrapods300 million years ago - amniotes200 million years ago - mammals100 million years ago - primates25-30 million years ago - apes6 million years ago - pan and homo split (chimp and human lines)200 thousand years ago - humans40 thousand years ago - humans become artists10-12 thousand years ago - humans become farmers9 thousand years ago - humans become city dwellers150 thousand years ago - humans become industrialistsOk, anyway I don't really agree with this timeline at all, but I'm not going to spend time trying to tear it apart. It's their belief, and that's fine with me. But to insist that the timeline takes no faith is ridiculous. Their goal was to rely on no faith but only pure science. Yeah, that's laughable when in chapter 2 they're already reverting to speculation and insisting evolution is a proven fact. Chapter 3 - authors insist that industrialized societies raise the quality of life with some downfalls. I couldn't agree more. Basically, we have traded some autonomy and traditionalism for novelty and a wealthier standard of living. This chapter explores many of the issues with westernized societies, which they express as WEIRD (westernized, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic). Yeah, that's us. Anyway, they explore a range of topics including lactose intolerance, appendicitis, and the like. They also introduce the concept of Chesterton's fence, borrowed from a work of G.K. Chesterton's dating back to the mid-early 20th century. Basically, reforms should not be made to a system until the reasoning behind the current state is understood. Ex: scientists used to want to remove the large intestine because they didn't see the use in it. However, just because you do not know the use does not mean you should just remove it. Rather, doctors and scientists should investigate till they find a use. The authors insist that our bodies have everything for a reason as a result of evolution, while I maintain this principle because the Lord made us with parts for a reason. Additionally, authors assert that most of our issues (like appendicitis) are native to WEIRD countries and a result of our refusal to adopt Chesterton's fence. Basically, be wary of new practices when you don't know the side effects. Chapter 4 - ""The treatment of the vast majority of medical complaints with drugs, rather than with actual diagnosis, weakens the ability of the medical system even to do diagnosis. It also pollutes the data stream: who knows who is sick with what, and from what origin, if so many people are on pharmaceuticals with unknown side-effects.""Our society places too much stock in pharmaceutical drugs we know nothing about. Rather than tending to disease and illness, we shove people onto drugs, and then give them more drugs to counter the side effect. This is an issue. If something is too good to be true, it probably isn't. Pharma is just one industry with flawed numbers and data that are used to prove something that isn't proven. Remember Chesterton's fence. Also establishes term ""reductionism"" - reducing to a few simple factors. That's not how it works. Medicine isn't a matter of a few things. We aren't all the same. Modern society uses drugs and numbers, but we are humans, not robots. I agree with the authors' assertion that we are not merely machines. They attribute this to evolution; I insist it is the fingerprint of God and the spirit within us that guides us in wisdom and direction. Cause and symptom often confused - ex: sunscreen decreases odds of skin cancer, but decreased sun exposure spikes blood pressure. ex: vitamin D supplements, fluoride, antibiotics, etc. The problem, of course, is not the existence of reductionism, but its over-application. Our society suffers from this over-application of reductionism and we fail to think for ourselves. Medicine is not merely a question of what solves short term problems, but what is best for our long-term health. The authors look back to our roots, and they say the best measures for health are moving every day, listening to our bodies, spending time in nature, going barefoot, and resisting pharmaceuticals. These open our minds to the sensory perception our bodies are made for. Chapter 5 is about diet - no fixed and universal answer. Food is not merely about survival, and the best answer is real food. Again, a discussion of the importance of fire and how food creates community. Basically, don't make eating all about calories and processed nutrients. Focus on eating real food and finding what is best for you. We aren't machines. Chapter 6 - Sleep - every animal sleeps. They assert this is because it's impossible to have an eye perfectly suited for night and day. I assert that it's because the Lord made us both to rest and to live. Regardless, if we did not sleep, they suggest we would spend 1/3 of the day useless. The Lord could have made us to work all the time, but he didn't. Anyway - REM takes our consciousness. To sleep between, regulate our light spectrum. Artificial light and the absence of natural darkness has majorly affected our sleep patterns. The authors also insist we should go to sleep early enough to wake up by the sun in our windows. Chapter 7 - Sex and Gender - Difference between the sexes are a reality, which is often a strength. Again, we are better together. The authors analyze some of the biological and physical differences between men and women. They also emphasize that there is a difference between acting feminine/engaging in ""feminine"" activities and actually being a female (and vice versa for males.) Another interesting fact is that the breasts of all other species disappear when they are unneeded, but for humans they stick around. Again, this is the Lord's gift, but they merely note it as an observation. Further, division of labor is often employed because of the natural differences between men and women. Throughout history, men have most often worked out of the home, and women have most often cared for the children. This is not an absolute necessity, but it is often natural and helpful. Chapter 8 - Parenthood and Relationship - they claim that love began with a mother and child. Not sure why exactly they think the original mothers would care about their children if the universe is without a point? Why would anyone care about generational persistence? Anyway, whatever. They claim sex in marriage alone is more beneficial for society for a wide variety of reasons, and they explore various cultural and ethnic phenomena. Chapter 9 - Childhood - humans have the longest childhoods on earth, and we have far more neurons than we use. *Think about the potential we have and were made to have - the first humans, Adam and Eve, probably utilized ALL these neurons. Wow* Children learn through observation and experiences, and they often learn from many people: siblings, friends, other adults, parents, etc. WEIRD parents are too focused on metrics and often do not free their kids to explore and play and fail. Quit putting bandages on every little bump or bruise and let the kids play. Play is vital. Also, an exploration of autism - asserting cause-effect relationship between digital interfaces/screens/objects. Developmental delays are ok; quit focusing on metrics and love your kids. Let them grow and learn. Chapter 10 - Education - ""The primary goal of real education is not to deliver facts but to guide students to the truths that will allow them to take responsibility for their lives."" School is a very new concept. For many skills, school is unnecessary. For some, like reading and writing, some level of instruction is necessary. It is far more difficult to teach critical thinking, logic, and creativity than memory and recall. Anyway, with modern education, ""parenting has been outsourced."" Education should not rely on fear - fear causes tidy lines and medicated kids and silent students. Fear is what we are built on in our modern systems. ""There are new things under the sun, but the fate of every generation is to think it arrived too late, that everything is understood and that the best response is total nihilist disarray."" They assert two principles are important: 1) that you are competing with others for your grade 2) learning only happens at this one time of the day. Chapter 11 - ""evolutionary truths"" rants again. Yeah, right. Ok. Anyway, four categories of people: con artists, confused, advise that works for them, universally applicable. Basically, a rant about how science is the only truth and everything else is in those other three categories and blah blah blah. Chapter 12 - a return to culture and consciousness. In times of stability, they assert that culture reigns, but in times of exploration and expansion, consciousness reigns. Reflection on the Asch conformity experiments - literally false, metaphorically true - basically means that something may not be the only way but it provides a standard that synchronizes people. Chapter 13 - Humans are obsessed with growth, thinking that growth goes on forever, but it doesn't. The result is a boom and bust cycle. We have four major resources (according to them) - 1) Geographic (unchartered territory) which is almost gone; 2) Technological innovations : just remember Chesterton's fence and be wary; 3) Transfers : basically seizing other people's things; 4) Consciousness: we can engineer indefinitely. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. ""Let us not romanticize any people or period. Let us instead understand humanity holistically, and work to provide opportunity equally to everyone going forward."" (A little socialist, maybe??) Yeah, suspicions confirmed - establishes they are liberals by the WEIRD term, and they understand that the blindspots of liberals are diminishing returns and unintended cons, while the cons of conservatives are negative externalities and underestimating finite resources. Every society has to pick a set of values, and freedom and justice cannot both be maximized here on earth. BUT JESUS CANEpilogue establishes their family celebrates a sort of evolutionary Hanukkah. Bruh. "

I was quite excited to have this book, to say the least. But, like others, I ended up feeling let down. It seemed to skim the surface of some really good topics that I was hoping to have found more in-depth discussion about, since it’s a BOOK. Too many stories about their life experience where it felt like they were more interested in sounding cool than truly adding to what points they were introducing or expounding upon. Bottom line is-I was really hoping that this would be a deeper dive into these subjects but I think they could’ve done a better job by cutting out half of the topics and then doubling the size of the book. It was all a little fluffy and I was quite surprised after hours of listening to two very interesting and intelligent people speak previously. Eh, we can’t all be it all, right?

67,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was waiting to read this book by the two professors who were cast out of Evergreen thanks to 'Social Justice' ideologues several years ago. Evolutionary Psychology has something to offend everyone and it easily does so if the reader isn't aware of how to handle what philosophers call the 'Naturalistic Fallacy' - just because something is natural does not mean it is 'good'.Decent book that gives a broad overview into EP and how our evolved biology interacts with today's modern innovations for good or ill. It doesn't take a deep dive into specifics. For those, you're better off reading Steven Pinker's Blank Slate which really goes into detail on multiple aspects of evo psych and its implications and many controversies. The book does mention those but only in general strokes.I wasn't sold on Bret and Heather's idea of Chesterson's Fence (do not remove or alter an existing item of culture until you've done a thorough analysis of exactly what this item contributes to our culture and to the underlying biological impulses behind it). Much of what makes up our modern world stemmed forth from the innovations put into place that solved issues at the time, only to create other problems later. I don't think they can successfully argue that many of those areas of progress were not worth the changes. They lead to 'better problems' not necessarily to calamities. Still, the point was well made that at least a general analysis had to be performed to determine possible effects, especially as we now live in an age where technological progress proceeds along an alarmingly fast rate.A decent read though I wouldn't put it up there with some of the ones I've gone over on EP. Pair this one with The Blank Slate to get more details."
68,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"I was prompted to read this book after hearing the author on the Jim Rutt show - a podcast I can strongly recommend. I thought the book would help me understand the tension between the rapidly changing environment we are creating for ourselves and what it is to be human in regard to our evolutionary adaptation. I’m not sure it really achieved this.The first couple of chapters were an interesting look at our evolutionary history, but not particularly insightful in relation to our adaptability challenge set against the pace of change. That is OK - an introduction is needed before moving on to the meat of the topic after all. Sadly the meat of the topic was a bit like a Big Mac (other burgers are available!) full of promise but ultimately a bit unsatisfying. At times, particularly around topics of sexuality, gender and family, I couldn’t quite put my finger on a bias present, but it felt like there was one that the authors were trying to mitigate whilst staying true to their values - a worthy aim of course. I’m also reminded that apparent bias in others who disagree with me might be more of a reflection of my bias than there’s!The final chapter was good though and set a strong case for a needed pivot in modern human culture to some kind of steady state over an obsession with growth. This chapter redeemed the book to me somewhat as I was glad I persisted to to the end before moving on to my next read."
69,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Fascinating book that discusses our place in the world through an ""evolutionary lens"". I particularly like the authors' non partisan approach to writting and thinking. The book is clearly political, it could hardly not be, but it is never partisan. They have an interesting blend of left- and right-wing ideas; in short something to annoy almost everyone.There were many ideas that I didn't agree with, for instance the authors' reticence on GM crops or nuclear energy. But even the points on which I disagreed I found they way in which the ideas were discussed quite constructive, to the point that I could see why they think what they think, even if I don't agree.On a more critical note the writting verges on the cryptic at times, some of it is quite dense and full of gnomic statements. Good writting can be challenging, but also accessable to a general audience. I'm well versed in the topics that they are talking about, but i wonder whether someone new to these topics would understand what they are talking about at points. This could be solved with a little bit more exposition around technical terms, or a simple glossary.Overall, incredibly nourishing food for thought."

There certainly is plenty of insightful narrative related to human evolution, our behaviors, culture, and consciousness (but take note: all the good stuff is condensed in the first couple chapters). That said, I really disliked the “Corrective Lens” at the end of each chapter. I understand the desire to button-up a broad topic for readers, but it would have been better done by posing a series of questions or issues to ponder rather than the deeply opinionated, self-indulgent, and frustratingly tone-deaf list of things that we should apparently be doing like them in order to be better “moderns.” Too many “I” and “we” statements, combined with recommendations that are simply not achievable (nor desirable/necessary/realistic) for most people in our society, and centered on the most privileged in our world.

Having listened to some podcasts featuring Heather and Brett and liking that format (not all of the conclusions but certainly their way of thinking) I purchased this book hoping to better understand their ideas, and they actually had a lot of their these ideas in this book as kind of a companion guide to life. However most of these ideas were not tied in well together as a full package which made the reading pretty bland.

This isn’t to say all their solutions are perfect or even correct for everybody, but the lens with which they present the modern world is one that is worth trying on yourself."
73,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4024817-otto-lehto,Rating 3 out of 5,"Criticisms of evolutionary theory often rely on misrepresentations or misunderstandings. None of the criticisms so far have succeeded in fundamentally undermining the central tenets of Darwinism. But the hasty application of evolutionary reasoning into human psychology and morality deserves to be criticized for failing to do Darwin justice. Evolution is a messy process that produces a lot that is not good, useful, or adaptive. There is a lot that evolutionary theory does not explain (completely or at all). Unfortunately, Heying and Weinstein appeal to dubious and overzealous evolutionary reasoning to justify their particular branch of ""conservative reformism"" which relies on a misapplication of the precautionary principle into all aspects of human life. The authors take the famous analogy of ""Chesterton's Fence"" to justify a form of blind reverence to evolved structures that passes from the reasonable to the pathological. In particular, they defend a form of (mostly outdated) pan-adaptationism according to which practically ALL features of human biology AND sociology that are complex, have survived for a long time, and are costly to maintain, should be assumed to be (and often are) adaptive. On the theoretical level, the pan-adaptationist thesis completely ignores the widespread presence of maladaptations, genetic drift, path dependency, group selection, etc., in human biology and human sociology, that contribute to the non-functional survival of our many extant biological and sociological features. The authors choose to ignore most of the active scholarly debate around these issues as it has developed in the last several decades, even though they should know better. They confidently assert that most features of our biology and sociology that we do not (fully) understand contribute to our wellbeing and survival in a way that should not be messed with. This is, at best, a half-truth. On one level, herein lies great wisdom. It is prudent to take on an attitude of humility towards the ingenuous engineering marvels of our biological and sociological evolutionary heritage. The functioning of the human heart, or the intricacies of the complex economic system, are often beyond our understanding, so we should err on the side of caution when attempting to overrule or redesign them. It is much easier to break things than to improve them, as any parent readily knows. However, taken to its logical conclusion - which the authors are willing to do - this view leads to madness. The book moves from the eminently reasonable proposition that there MIGHT be unknown functional reasons for our appendix, wisdom teeth, tail bone, or chronic pain responses that we simply do not understand, to the unreasonable conclusion that there MUST be functional reasons to most of them. This leads them to embrace controversial and sometimes downright wacky theories about health, medicine, and psychological wellbeing. This leads to a conservative or ""paleo-friendly"" attitude towards modern medicine, urban life, modern technologies, social media, processed food, nontraditional lifestyles, and belief systems. For example, they explicitly embrace the view that pain is almost certainly functional, so we should most often not use painkillers, or even many recommended medical treatments, but rather listen to our bodies' pain signals as natural guides to our healing. This is the naturalistic fallacy taken to its limit. In social life, they argue that we should START by assuming the reasonableness and functional utility of evolved structures, such as traditional social norms regarding the family unit, gender relations, and organized religion, even if we should not always STOP there. This is not a crazy position. But it goes hand-in-hand with a massive undervaluation of the possibility that our social order suffers from massive, persistent functional maladaptations that erode our wellbeing. Many of the features that were adaptive a thousand years ago are no longer so. And many of the features that were adaptive a million years ago have ceased to be functional hundreds of thousands of years ago. My overall verdict is the same as my verdict on our evolutionary heritage itself: it is an unsatisfactory mixture of the good, the bad, and the ugly. The authors give too much credit to the selection pressures that supposedly operate to weed out bad features of our biology and sociology. In fact, we should acknowledge that many of those selection pressures are too weak to eliminate maladaptations, especially in a rich society where it does not take much work at all to spread your genes. But I do agree with the authors that there is a lot to be learned by studying carefully the various supposedly anachronistic world views of the past, on the basis that they probably have some survival value even though W.E.I.R.D. (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) people, eager to embrace social progress in all such matters, might disagree. A lot of people are too eager to embrace progress for its own sake, regardless of the hidden costs. But Heying & Weinstein go too far in the other direction. They underestimate the moral need, and practical possibility, for social progress. And they mix personal opinion and hearsay with solid scientific argumentation. So, although there is a lot of wisdom to be gained from the book, the selection pressures in the editing stage were clearly not strong enough to eliminate all the errors."

81,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107567624-philip,Rating 2 out of 5,"This is a ""meh"" for me. It's ok, but that's it. Regardless of what the authors' credentials might imply, this book is essentially just their idea of how to live. Which is kind of ironic since, arguably, the best advise they give is that you shouldn't take someone else's idea of how to live to heart. As evidenced by them noting this in the book, the irony is not lost on them. The other advice I really liked is that life - individual and societal - is a constant compromise (they specifically used the safety v. freedom example); there is no utopia where everything is just right. Having heard some of the criticism of both this book and its author in advance, I do think some of it is a bit unfair. Yes, they are clearly conservatives in some regards - and clearly have some (in my opinion) wacky ideas - but they also have plenty of ""progressive"" ideas (albeit that a fair amount of them seem to rest in idealized versions of life closer to nature - another irony since they, correctly in my opinion, argue that we should neither idealize nor demonize any given culture). A more fair criticism (than the ""conservative"") would be that they have picked what they believe in - conservative or liberal, wacky or not - and then sort of framed it all in such a way that it seems to be based in science (whether that's the case or not). This means that the book sometimes appear indistinguishable from objective ""truth,"" and sometimes it's an extreme case of subjective and doubtful interpretations of conflation, correlation, and even faith. Most of the time it appears to land somewhere on the sliding scale in between. The biggest fault I find with the reasoning in the book is the constant (and I mean constant) references to Chesterton's Fence (the heuristic principle to hold off on reforms until one understands the reasoning behind the current state of affairs - else one might make things worse). It appears to be the reasoning underlying the authors' every argument - or, perhaps more accurately, it is the authors' only argument. That is, except when it suits them to not abide by it. With Chesterton as their hapless comrade in arms, Heying and Weinstein pull from their personal and professional experiences - arguing that it's all based in evolutionary biology - to tell us what's wrong with the world and how they think we should live. They really don't like some modern things, arguing that evolutionary adaptations that have stuck around are good and modern changes aren't - based on the fact that evolution otherwise would have developed an adaptation by now otherwise. Ultimately though, they fail. There are some very good arguments in this book - some of which I agree with, some of which I don't - but in the end, the authors trip themselves up in their own arguments. And yes, I'm totally oversimplifying this a bit, but I don't think I'm misrepresenting it. Simply put, you can't both eat the cake and have it too. You can't both argue that things you don't agree with (like, for example, the Covid19 vaccines - the authors, famously, are opponents to them) are bad because they're new and unproven, and simultaneously create hindsight exemptions for some groundbreaking stuff (something they do to not sound like total idiots). Again, there are some good arguments in here. If they'd have kept it simple - like, say, arguing that there are some mismatches between our evolutionary biology and modern life - this book would have been essentially unassailable. But I don't imagine there would have been anything to gain either. There is that.So, my recommendation? Read another book. Get the information without the preachy and self-congratulatory side-dish of subjective humdrum."

If you are a curious person…if you are someone who seeks out better ways of living and being…if you enjoy thinking about life/humanity/everything through an evolutionary lens…then this is a great book to check out. Heying and Weinstein cover a lot of ground and, in doing so, toss out all sorts of profound insights in a relatively short period of time without ever really going into too much detail. It’s a crash course in their thinking, teaching, and learned experience. I don’t agree with everything they say (or sometimes how they say it) but there are some great nuggets worth collecting and holding onto. (I, for instance, have continued to navigate my life thoughtfully in regards to The Precautionary Principle —when facing novel things consider the risk and, if the risk is potentially high, exercise caution firstly. This dovetails nicely with another idea they present at the outset of the book: Hyper-novelty. We live in a time when the rate of change in the world is higher than our ability to keep up with it in a healthy manner: a time of hyper-novelty. We would be wise to exercise precaution when constantly bombarded by hyper-novelty.)Speaking of great nuggets, there are several other definitions and tools for thinking/navigating 21st century life which are presented —most of which have evolutionary-framed origins (The Naturalist Fallacy, The Sucker’s Folly, Costly Signaling, Trade-offs, Reductionism and Complexity, Anti-fragility) and others of which are original to the authors (Chesteron’s Fence, The Omega Principle, Environments of Evolutionary Adaptedness, The Fourth Frontier).To be honest, I tore through this book (mostly) exclaiming “YES, EXACTLY!” I have a tendency to think about things from an evolutionary mindset so many things in this book weren’t new to me but were stated succinctly and relevantly. There were a few times when I was beginning to become deeply immersed in the specific subject matter before they abruptly hopped onto another subject. Consequently, this book often felt rushed; like a stone skipping across a flat body of water.Overall, the book was satisfying to read. It offered evolutionary explanations to several things I had never thought about before. Heather and Brett have a lot to offer the world. Theodosius Dobzhansky said, “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.” Humans are biological creatures so it stands to reason that we can make a lot of sense by examining our lives (and ways of being) through an evolutionary lens. This book will give you a lot of different lenses to try on and look through, all of which are evolutionary. Pick it up, try it on, and see things in a new light.(Sidenote: Many people won’t read this book because of political reasons regarding the authors (even though the book is, in no way, political). In fact, many people never gave this book a fair chance because of those various “political"" reasons and some have even written reviews without even reading the book (I’m looking at you The Guardian) A lot of those reviewers are also resorting (unwittingly?) to ad hominem attacks, coming in so biased that they can’t or won’t objectively examine what is actually being said in the book. Ignore the haters. Heather and Bret don’t cow to the latest trends of (group)thinking when it contradicts evidence supported by the ongoing process of science and that has caused many people to consider them the enemy. Heather and Bret are courageous and intelligent people. Like all of us they make mistakes. But they are trying to help more people think deeply, critically, and evolutionarily. They are fighting for anyone who stops to listen.)"

The book was full of interesting insights from an evolutionary biology perspective but struggled to stay fully attentive to the audiobook. The writing was somewhat dry and overall felt text-bookish (i.e. strictly sticking to scientific nomenclature). This combined with Brett and Heather reading the audiobook (not the most enthralling voices is an understatement) made it difficult to focus my attention and had to keep backing-up. The book covered several topics from food and sleep to sex and gender to parenting and never shied away from sticking to the facts, however, unpopular the conclusion. I have to say I am huge fan of Brett and Heather. I don't always agree with their viewpoints but they are part of a handful of public intellectuals that do not let feelings and popular opinion dictate truth. In the last few years, I've increasingly become aware that while we assume responsible adults are at the steering wheel (across government, science, academia, etc), it's actually children driving the car. All those in positions of such responsibility so quickly caving and kowtowing to the latest twitter mob - not dissimilar to 4th graders giving in to peer pressure to not be the outlier. Bret and Heather are acting like actual adults when we so desperately need them. They stick to their principles despite the consequences (as evidenced by the woke student mob violently harassing him at Evergreen college for his stance). Along these lines, they encourage readers to be ""Asch-negative"" referring to the famous conformity experiment where only a small fraction of the test subjects did not cave to pressure and misrepresent an obvious length of a line against another line. Another concept that has very much impacted my perspective is Bret's concept of ""metaphorical truth"". I had learned of this concept from him prior to reading the book but it is essentially that we should be leery of dismissing metaphorical truth which is culture, beliefs, rituals that are literally false or at least unfalsifiable but can be true in a sense that we are better off for believing in them. I think many people especially those who were raised in a religious culture get so hung up on proving the literal truth that if/when they finally crack (i.e. lose faith/become atheist's) they end up throwing out the baby with the bathwater - ceasing to follow tenets that lead to a disciplined and wholesome way of life rich with happiness and meaning. I don't think we should feel like we need to have concrete knowledge of the literal truth in something like belief in god that is IMO not falsifiable. Instead a faith can be more of a hope and we should all respect others' hopes but acknowledge them for what they are. The book is chock full of other interesting concepts like Natural Fallacy (just because something is doesn't mean something should be), learning from first principals (break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up), Chesterton's fence (principle that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is fully understood).

Fans will instantly pick up on familiar themes and vocabulary from the show in this book, but, as I hoped, this is not a re-tread of show episodes. We know Heather & Bret are evolutionary biologists who discuss topics through that lens, but the book allows listeners to really see that side of their careers come together in a more fleshed out way which probably only their Evergreen students had had the privilege to experience. As tragic as the fallout of the Evergreen saga was, it has allowed Heather and Bret to move from touching the lives of a few students, to being a teacher to a much wider audience of willing listeners. One door closes and another one opens as they say.The initial chapters of the book are all set up of how humans historically came to be. Readers need this base to build upon for later chapters, but it did make the book slow to start. Once we got into the meat and potatoes of dissecting various aspects of modern life, I was hooked. I was able to immediately put their observations into use in my own life to solve some modern problems I’d been having. A small example, but I’d been toying with the idea of buying a reading light. I enjoyed reading by the fireplace at night but turning on the bright can lights not only ruined the ambiance, but it was just too much light. Thanks to this book, I did end up getting a reading light, but I opted for the therapeutic red light they suggested (to mimic the campfire experience of our ancient ancestors), which I wouldn’t have even known existed without the book. Everything I was experiencing clicked with what they described before and after I implemented the recommended changes to live my more hunter/gatherer self. I know this book is supposed to be broader so that it can touch on many subjects and the authors are evolutionary biologists not self-help book authors. However, I desperately wanted more detail out of each chapter, specifically a how-to guide to parenting. I gobbled up the anecdotal stories about Bret and Heather’s lives and how they implemented these strategies. The best parts of the book were when it was coupled with real world examples, and I’d love to see a follow-on book that focused in on even just one of these chapters specifically (again I’m rooting for a parenting guide since I think that’s an area we are in critical need of help). Until then I hope to have absorbed enough in this book that I’ll be able to go out into the world and be able to more clearly siphon out the harmful modern influences in favor of the tried-and-true methods of humanities ancestors which our bodies were adapted to live by."

It covers the usual sorts of material they do on their podcast--comparing what we're attuned to by evolution (both biological and cultural) to demands and expectations of the modern world. It's an anthropological perspective in part which draws from Henrich's WEIRDest People in the World, among other things. I find that the insights Heying and Weinstein have to offer are many, and I find great intellectual value in hearing their arguments and perspectives, but still I struggled to finish this book because it was telling us how to behave and what we should care about and it was just preachy. Quality ideas, but even when I have the deepest respect for the intelligence and wisdom of the speaker, I don't cotton to being told what I should and shouldn't care about and why. The book is a personal essay whose thesis is that our [human] ability to change has outstripped our much slower ability to adapt, and how this is destroying us on several levels: physically, psychologically, socially, and environmentally, and that this will destroy us and how we can stop it. Hence the preaching tone, I suppose. It would be hard to not do it with a message like that. There was another oddity in the book and it is that when they use a common science word, they assume it is understood by their audience. I do understand some of them but not all, and it was disconcerting to encounter a somewhat specialized word that was not immediately explained from time to time. "

I don't agree with all the authors put forth, but they have some incredibly thought provoking ideas that challenge some of my personal ideas and are worth considering.Some personal notes below.49% ""Broadly speaking, there are three possible reproductive strategies: 1. Partner up and invest long term, reproductively, socially, and emotionally. 2. Force reproduction on an unwilling partner. 3. Force nobody, but also invest little beyond short-term sexual activity....The final alternative male strategy, however, is also not honorable or desirable for society, and yet has been encouraged for women by ""sex-positive"" activist as a sign of freedom and escape from puritanism. This third reproductive strategy is that of one-night stands. Of sex with strangers. Of sex without commitment or expectation. This strategy does not involve force--many women will often willingly sleep with a guy they just met. Such sexual liaisons do tend to come with some deceit, though, often by both parties. If women adopting some of the worst traits of men is our evidence of equality and freedom, we need to reinvestigate our values.....It's not as bad as rape, obviously. But it's not as good as strategy one, either. Society sliding toward this third reproductive strategy for both men and women is a variation on the Sucker's Folly--the tendency of concentrated short-term benefit (sexual pleasure) not only to the obscure risk and long-term cost, but also to drive acceptance even when the net analysis is negative (in reducing the chances of finding love and all that flows from it).""

Given what the book promises (= a practical guide to navigating the clash between the modern condition and deep ancestral wisdom), it really falls flat.Most people with a basic understanding of evolution will have come across these concepts before, and if not, an explanatory article would have been more than sufficient: in a nutshell, the book urges its readers to seek out discomfort for the benefit of growth, to not fix (or throw out) anything that isn't broken, and to spend more time in nature & in community with others. However trivial, better writers would have been able to extract something truly profound, even touching from this set of premises. Heying and Weinstein, however, published what is essentially a 350-page listicle, peppered with cherry-picked case studies and self-congratulatory tales of their superior teaching and parenting styles. This is not to say that their claims are fundamentally incorrect - they are simply not as challenging, edgy or mind-bending as the authors clearly believe them to be. To anyone who has gathered the book's basic gist, the irony becomes obvious: ""A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide"" mashes the still contested complexities of evolution into an easily digestible pulp, feeding you baby food rather than brain fuel."

Their dramatically named ""Omega"" principle is a genuinely useful anthropological heuristic. But this is a self-help book first and foremost, and I hate self-help books for a reason. It's written with all the certainty and hubris the genre requires.They argue throughout that cultural ideas and institutions are just as important to our identity as a species as our bipedalism. Great. And they say that if you don't understand the value of an adaptation, you should maybe learn more about it before you dismiss it as unnecessary. Couldn't agree more. But beyond all their kids-these-days screeds and hand-wringing over gender identity, it genuinely never seems to cross their minds that modern changes to society might be legitimate adaptations to our changing environment. They say over and over that our ability to adapt to new conditions socially is vital, then in an eyeblink say, ""But today's changes must be wrong."" If all your decades of experience as scientists leads you to the same crunchy-mom conclusions so many other people arrive at emotionally, you've got to stop and make sure that maybe you weren't trying to get to those conclusions all along.Are today's new ideas a threat to our children? I don't know! Neither do they! So I expect people who want to write about society to have the appropriate amount of self-skepticism. That attitude is nowhere to be found in this book.

In fact, save it for when the kids AREN'T around and listen at the recorded speed. Also, listen to what the authors are suggesting, digest it, and THEN decide whether you want to be offended or not. There were definitely parts where I raised an eyebrow and said to myself, ""clearly these two do NOT have kids or work with kids who are special needs."" But I digested, decided they had spoken with their caveats in place and with only the authority that seemed to be appropriate, and continued listening.Having said that, the book breaks humanity down into its various ages/relationships/parts and then connects the topics together by teasing everything out into a greater thematic discussion (individual life/social/cultural/humanity).

Subtitled ‘Evolution and the Challenges of Modern Life’, these co-authors are both evolutionary biologists and a married couple.The initial chapters introduce the human species’ role as the animal that can adapt to any circumstance, and then cover a brief history of the lineage preceding humans since life “blinked into existence” on Earth. The third chapter is spent on the central conundrum that our bodies and our psyches are evolved for a world in which we no longer live and that this is cause of many problems. Furthermore, that our tendency to innovate in the face of these problems is solving as many of these problems as it is exacerbating. This paradoxical idea is what the authors define as modernity. The state of having so rapidly culturally advanced from our ancestral state that we are no longer evolved to fit it, and every solution to this that we propose is a bewildering double-edged sword.The bulk of the book is then divided into chapters where each takes an area of life and considers how modernity is impacting us in the context and what we may be able to do to help ourselves. These areas are Medicine, Food, Sleep, Sex and Gender, Parenthood and Relationships, Childhood, School and Becoming Adults. Eight giant topics, each of which deserves its own book, but that all of us should deeply care about as they are fundamental to our human experience. Somehow each of the topics is so central to our lives that they can seem almost redundant or boring to bring up, but they should actually be a central focus of anyone wishing to understand and optimise their life.For me, the final two chapters are where the book gets really exciting. ‘Culture and Consciousness’ explores our current knowledge of what consciousness is and is where the authors make some new propositions about the evolved nature of both. The authors propose that consciousness is individual, it is evolved so that one person can break new boundaries or invent a new technology that can come to benefit everyone. Culture is the collective, it is the mechanism that behaviourally aligns everyone together so that everyone does not have to re-learn everything about how to survive themselves, it is an efficient diffusion of accumulated inherited wisdom. It strikes me that nearly every societal debate is had over how to optimally balance the two sides of this coin. ‘The Fourth Frontier' deals with the future. It is neither foolishly hopeful nor irrationally gloomy. It is a call to action for all of us. Highlighting that we cannot go back to hunter gatherer lifestyle, but that we must carefully and cautiously find a way forward, bringing only what is beneficial and discarding what is harmful, because we haven’t a choice.As a popular science reader, I found the book held a refreshing perspective, and if anything was unsatisfyingly short. As a PhD candidate studying genetics and human past, I enjoyed the succinct and palatable explanation of evolutionary concepts.The authors walk a difficult stylistic line between robust scientific literature and popular reading for the layman. At times I feel they slip too far into personal anecdote which may detract from the credibility, though perhaps the layman reader would have the alternate opinion. The authors do fabulously with stories that they do include, they may illustrate a point, or to connect the reader to the authors, this is a very warm book where you often feel as though you’re sitting around sharing a yarn with Bret and Heather. While perhaps less scientific, the embellishment of narrative serves to personify the ancient humans that would have explored their world. Giving life to people that are usually just data points or samples in test tubes, despite the fact they are our heritage. In any case, this is a book written fantastically to satiate layman and scientist alike.While the discussions of modern sex and relationships through the evolutionary lens are both interesting and useful, I believe there is a tendency to be overly conservative here. Especially as the authors themselves have been married for long enough to have skipped many of the current perils of modern love. While many of their suggestions are justified, they fail to distinguish between those of us trying to set up families and those not. The case can easily be made for monogamy and conventionalism when trying to construct a safe child-raising environment, but so many adult individuals today do not fall into this category. I do not think the author’s conclusions that we should avoid pornography and casual sex are entirely wrong, but rather they shouldn’t be so deterministic about them, human sexuality and relationship is far more variable than many realise, and I’d refer the reader to Cacilda Jethá and Christopher Ryan’s Sex At Dawn for an intriguing evolutionary investigation of the origins of human sexuality.For the evolutionary biologists out there, the book goes further than just another colloquial summarisation of science for the masses. Heying and Weinstein propose novel scientific advances to established evolutionary theory. These include a rejection of the false dichotomy of nature vs. nurture in lieu of an all-encompassing mechanism whereby culture itself is an evolved epigenetic mechanism that serves the genome, and the formulation of a three-step test to identify if a phenomenon is adaptive or incidental. If there is a critique, it is that the scientist in me yearns to see this explored in a more in depth and technical way, and I can only hope they continue the work."
92,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45104328-mary,Rating 2 out of 5,"Overall, I was wildly disappointed in this book. There are a few fascinating sections, but the vast majority of the content was presented in a dogmatic, preachy way. The number of times a concept was described as ""honorable"" really got on my nerves. Sweeping generalizations can be found throughout. It is ironic how many times the authors claim that readers should aim to be more open-minded, yet treat many topics in this book (i.e. same sex relationships) in an extremely narrow-minded, and frankly ignorant, manner. I did not expect slut-shaming or an attack on sexual freedom in a book about evolutionary biology. The entire chapter on sex and gender actually made me cringe several times. This doesn't feel like a book that was written in 2021."
93,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10698286-michael-philliber,Rating 3 out of 5,"For most of it, the book was a fun and fascinating read. In most of it I felt like Libertarianism was meeting evolutionary biology, and Ayn Rand was dancing with scientists. The authors, through their take on evolution, came to the same places where I am socially. In their book, evolution in homo sapiens supports monogamy as the best type of marital relationship; evolution teaches us that males are males and females are females; and the list goes on.But, as someone who is not convinced by evolution (call me a troglodyte on such issues), I felt like the foundation for their conclusions was pragmatic. And then, as they wrap up the work it left me cold. Something of an apocalyptic twist comes round in the final two chapters. Fun and fascinating most of the way through, but based on their premises, I wasn’t convinced."

Talks about how our evolutionary past is affecting us today and what we can do to change our lives for the better because of that. It also talks about the evolutionary effect on the world's sustainability and what we need to do now, as a whole because of that. I think what I loved the most though, is Heying and Weinstein's way of analyzing. Its non-politically biased or any type of biased. It helps me to think critically and patiently about things and they helped me see what to value in life. They cover so many topics I can't list them! Super cool for anyone and everyone! I don't think there's a person that wouldn't benefit in some way from this book!"

It brought to light many of our evolutionary mismatches in how we have adapted and the overly novel world we live in today. The book did a great job in describing how and why we have evolved a certain way, what in our modern world is detrimental to us and what we can do to minimize their negative effects. I found the sections on dating, sex, and child rearing particularly interesting. This is a book I’d love to add to my collection and read again or reference. "

The thing is, though, that it wasn't worth my time and not worth the time of anybody who is already exposed to evo psych. Clearly it was published with the intention to get more money from their viewers.Her style is so obviously over the top. Imo she is not deep, but she tries so hard to appear so.

We have forgotten our natural selves and have lost sight of truth. We are headed for destruction, and not for the reasons that most of us might think. It was a lot of fun listening to these two fatbrains tell it like it is. "
99,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,Interesting to see our condition through evolutionary eyes. It gives a history of our evolutionary being on this planet which helps to understand ourselves from the core. Sometimes I thought it was a little to reductionists. Trying to explain the human condition through evolutionary biology only. But I thought they had beautiful conclusions about what these ‘facts’ implicated for us as humans. Overall I really enjoyed reading it.
100,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82344611-faisal-khan,Rating 3 out of 5,This book wasn't quite what I was expecting. I thought it would have more of an anthropological lens explaining how our primitive instincts developed through evolution for a hunter-gatherers lifestyle can be reconciled in a postmodern world. Rather i found it to be more of a biological history and can't say I enjoyed it too much
101,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3832643-nancy,Rating 3 out of 5,"While I agree with many of the concepts laid out in this book (particularly the co-sleeping, baby/infant wearing, and breastfeeding) I take issue with many of the conclusions which seem to remove any and all discussion of racism and sexism of the modern world. I do not agree with the authors that because these exist they have been ""selected for"" in human culture. There needs to be cultural humility when discussing these topics and that is lacking in the discussion. I read this book directly after reading ""The Dawn of Everything"" so I may be more inclined to disagree with many of the assumptions and conclusions drawn in this book.I earned my anthropology degree in 1989 but have not kept up with all the literature in the field since then. Both of these books have served to update me on discussions in the field and I feel that I need to read more to enable me to think and discuss these subjects in greater depth."

The authors give some very excellent insights and advice, with equally as many correlation assumptions and jumping to conclusions. I learned interesting trivia about biology, but also came away asking how to leap to the conclusion that all human advancements must be heavily regulated. By whom? How do we know that they have properly sorted the risks and benefits? This book offers lots to discuss and consider, but one cannot assume it has all the right answers. For their part, the authors/professors honestly believe that their students should question their assertions, which is good…because ai have lots of questions and disagreements. "

111,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7484504-greg-mcneilly,Rating 3 out of 5,"Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein's ""Hunter Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century"" offers a refreshing and insightful perspective on how humans can thrive in today's rapidly changing world. As evolutionary biologists, the authors bring a unique lens to the table, drawing upon our species' history to provide practical advice for navigating the complexities of modern life.The book is divided into four parts, tackling a distinct aspect of human existence. Part One, ""Understanding Ourselves,"" delves into the evolutionary roots of human behavior, shedding light on why we act the way we do. From the role of dopamine in motivation to the importance of community, the authors provide a compelling explanation of our innate drives and desires.Part Two, ""Navigating the World,"" applies the same evolutionary framework to explore how our surroundings shape our actions and decisions. Topics range from the impact of urbanization on mental health to the influence of social media on our relationships. Throughout this section, Heying and Weinstein challenge readers to question their assumptions about the world around them.In Part Three, ""Building Resilience,"" the authors focus on strategies for cultivating individual resilience in adversity. They advocate for physical exercise, mindfulness, and creativity, all of which help us adapt to an ever-changing environment. This section also includes valuable discussions on managing stress, building meaningful relationships, and finding purpose in life.Finally, Part Four, ""Rethinking Society,"" takes a step back to examine the larger structures that govern our society. Here, the authors critique contemporary institutions such as education, healthcare, and government while offering proposals for positive change. Their arguments are well-supported and thought-provoking, encouraging readers to rethink their assumptions about the systems that shape our lives.Throughout the book, Heying and Weinstein present a convincing argument for why we must look to our evolutionary past to navigate the complexities of the 21st century. By embracing our hunter-gatherer heritage, they suggest we can better appreciate the natural world, improve physical and mental health, and foster stronger communities.One of the strengths of ""Hunter Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century"" is its accessibility. Although the authors draw heavily from scientific research, they manage to convey complex ideas in an approachable and engaging manner. The text is peppered with relatable analogies and anecdotes, rendering even the most abstract concepts understandable to a general audience.Moreover, the book's interdisciplinary nature makes it appealing to many readers. Whether you're interested in psychology, anthropology, sociology, or simply looking for self-improvement strategies, there's something here for everyone. Heying and Weinstein's passion for their subject matter shines through on every page, making the reading experience enjoyable and enlightening.If I were to offer any criticism, some sections feel disconnected from the main thread of the book. While the authors do an admirable job of tying their ideas together, a few chapters could benefit from additional integration with the central themes. Additionally, while well-intentioned, some of the prescriptions offered for modern ills, such as reducing smartphone use or increasing physical activity, feel obvious and lack detailed implementation strategies.In conclusion, ""Hunter Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century"" is a stimulating and thought-provoking read that challenges readers to reassess their place in the world. Heying and Weinstein provide a persuasive argument for embracing our evolutionary history to create a better future. While not all of their suggestions may resonate with every reader, the book inspires introspection and encourages individuals to take a proactive approach to creating a fulfilling life. This guide is highly recommended for anyone seeking fresh perspectives on navigating the complexities of modern existence.KEY QUOTES:""Our genes and our environment are constantly conspiring against us, trying to pull us away from the natural state in which we were designed to thrive.""

The palpable doomy-gloomy undertone of Heying's and Weinstein's line of argument, especially towards the end of the book, can become a bit repetitive and tedious. Still, I enjoyed most of the read and can sympathise with the basic idea and cause."
113,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14046991-ben-rogers,Rating 3 out of 5,"Heather Heying's Hypnotic Hunter-History HandbookThis was a thought-provoking book that delves into the evolution of human beings and how our ancestors lived and thrived in their environments. The author, Heather E. ""Evolution"" Heying, offers a unique perspective on modern life and the challenges it presents, as well as how our ancestors' behaviors and practices can offer valuable insights into contemporary issues. The book is well-researched and provides an in-depth look at the evolution of human society and its impact on the world today.I found the book quite a slow read, but it's a pretty good fit for those who are passionate about anthropology and interested in exploring the interconnections between our ancestral roots and the challenges we face in the modern world. Although the book is not half as compelling as Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, it still offers a valuable contribution to the conversation around evolution and the human experience.Overall, if you enjoy reading about anthropology and the evolution of human society, then A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century is definitely worth checking out.3.6/5"

115,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5215579-steven,Rating 1 out of 5,"The fake opposition that is the NYT blessed IDW has gifted us another nonsense book from a massive publisher to suffer under. The true signs of a dissident movement. As a quick aside: this got me thinking of when Palin and McCain (RIP brain tumor) were branded as “mavericks” when they were literally just neocons.As a prefatory note: I scribbled these notes as I went. Sometimes things will have been corrected later in the book, but won’t always reflect that in this review (line by line). I think that’s an issue with the writing and editing so I’ve largely kept things in tact aside from editing.The key errors before we get going (the TL;DR): The book mainly implies that interests don't exist. Their thinking around what is adaptive isn't in reference to a given ecology. Plasticity is conflated with positive conditional proceeds. And no justification is given for the underlying moral system. Anyways, the book (quotes are dismissive paraphrases unless specified):Page 3: “we need to discover the right answers to transcend our problems through gnosis. Nobody knows what to do!” This will be wrapped up with a prescription at the end of the book. If you watch Vervaeke’s meaning playlist, you’ll notice the same thing is in lecture one of that course. Everything from before has to be pretended to be invalid for SOME reason.Page 4: (real quote) ""the answer will be found, in large measure, in understanding what it is to be human."" So we'll see that people are a certain way, and somehow an ought will necessarily emerge. High IQ book incoming. This is actually related to a segment of my upcoming academic book. This scientism based anthropology (view of man) is wholly provisional, so being a person doesn’t mean anything fixed, and valuations can be read into it in whichever way deemed expedient.page 4 contd: we have the stated goal of producing a system that allows novelties to proliferate. This is an endorsement of the revolutionary merry-go-round that the West has been spinning around on for the last few hundred years. “Surely, the next scene in Junji Ito's horror comic Uzumaki (spirals) will be less distorted than the last 300 pages have been.” Nonsense. Lastly on this page: we have the tired idea that the ""human niche"" is ""the tribe"" (decomposed by the authors into consciousness and culture), which is a dodge employed by evolutionary psychologists to say their favorite equalitarian word: panspecific. No Cold Winters theory etc. allowed. Page 5: technocratic mythos initiated. Neil Degrasse Tyson on standby. we're all on the same team with no ancestral lands, because of global consequences. What? This is the Philosophy of UNESCO vision.Page 7: “in order to solve the problems, we need everyone to plug in and parallel process....” as if there are no theories of ethnic conflict that would clearly present issues for this program by Nimrod Jr and his wife. See: Van Den Berghe (Race and Racism) and Vanhanen (Ethnic Conflicts: Their Biological Roots in Ethnic Nepotism) on this issue. There’s also assumed to be a generic answer every system would come to.7 continued: ""the best ideas win"" while society is endlessly taking on all the wrong ideas according to … the IDW? This is absurd. Apparently Propaganda by Jacques Ellul hasn't been written, and neither has the Extended Phenotype. Interested people don't employ means to control minds through their available means? Come on. Page 9: “what works becomes culture, and our culture is going wrong.” this is so dumb.The end of page 9 inserts an ought through the use of ""should"". Where did this ""should"" come from and which system is it a proceed of? It's a mystery. The hide the ball game continues. Literally as bad as the Vegans that Dyer debated.Page 10 has bizarre comments about ecological, and financial disasters. Somehow this is everyone's fault via opulence. Makes no sense. Maybe this is some kind of Liberal fantasy around “informed citizenry” and democracy (ewww). Pg 11: biologists literally expand their analysis beyond one generation all the time. Offspring Sex ratios for example (SC Stearns has a good lecture in his Yale OCW course). There's also a paper from WD Hamilton on a relevant issue mentioned around winter/drought, except Hamilton is concerned with reproductive consequences for different ""builds"" of an insect that interacts with transient wood (?). It's in vol 1 of his papers. If anybody cares, I can grab my copy and dig it out. In retrospect while editing this: I think this is partly how the authors are trying to wiggle out of the “in a given ecology” thinking that undergirds all thinking around what’s adaptive.Pg 13 It's stated that the conventional wisdom in biology is that genetic elements are the only source of heritable information. Has anybody ever believed this?14 it says we can alter culture for the worst, when culture is said to be beneficent realities collectivized. This book is a mess. 16-17 Having something that can change quickly in culture is adaptive, because nobody would ever pour mountains of cash into perfecting psychological landscape lock picks in the service of satanic brainwashing that would be performed on willing participants. Oh wait. That's exactly how the world is today. And the “non-existent” selection against being as repositionable as we are has been underway for over 100 years. The repositioning is maladaptive, so intelligence is on the decline. Being educable is an example of plasticity. Plasticity isn’t “adaptive”. It can be when being educated means better economic outcomes and your kids make it more often (Christendom), but it isn’t when being fungible leads you to Planned Parenthood appointments. They teach this to 19 year old undergrads.There's this weird lineage chapter where a number of pages don't have relevance to the book. I don't get it. The Cosmic Significance of Monkey by St Bret the Professorpage 35: it's said that 200,000ya man is the same as people today. I'm just going to leave that at that. The ghost of Gould smiles at this weird insertion of stasis. Evolution is the mainstream explanatory framework for the diversity of life, except this weird stasis that makes equalitarianism true. The 10,000 year explosion didn't happen/isn't happening.Pg 40: the thinking in the west (WEIRD) is from the environment. The thinking that initiated that artifact and innovation accumulation was somehow the product of it, even though it didn't exist yet. 10/10. Typical left wing view. “How do you get that off the ground” is, again, unanswerable. Low IQ book.pg 45: we see persistence of either side of our “dual inheritance” over evolutionary time is a test of adaptation, but people are unchanged since 200,000ya according to this book, unless it's the ad hoc acceptance of lactose tolerance (equalitarian on brains, but not tummies!). This just seems like a “let’s not be crazy!” controlled opposition walking back of Gould’s nonsense. Biology has recovered from the Gould and Lewontin sabotage, and we’re not buying this anymore.58: honestly, with this species diversification hedge point, I think their cards are being left in plain view. The reader is supposed to be swallowed up into an artificially imposed group (Good of the Species!). We're supposed to be global neoliberal chattel. I knew I was going to read this since the IDW was literally promoted by the NYT, but it's always nice when they show what they're up to. Why should I care that indigenous Australians are a hedge against extinction? They have nothing to do with me nor my way of life. This is bizarre. Gould said the same bizarre thing.61: scientism is bad... in a scientism book. Yowza. The absolute state.71: interventions that don't work somehow work. Tom Woods from Latin Mass Magazine has an ebook that covers this. This is one of the only negatives in this chapter though. Good job I guess. Food chapter: I skimmed this. This is a good chapter. It's an accessible nutritional anthropology chapter. People groups do have diet specific adaptations, and microbiomes. The best chapter so far. Sleep: didn't read it aside from the box at the end. Makes sense with what I've heard. No issues as far as I'm concerned. The sex chapter: this has some evolution of sexual reproduction stuff, which should be uninterested to people who've read on the topic before. The revolutionary anthropology makes another appearance in this chapter where ""outdated"" and ""regressive"" views of man are denounced. They're the wrong ways to be people according to [hidden standard]. These new ways of being that produce sterile ethotypes are adaptive, bruh! Note: biology in this book is about tradeoffs when there’s a hard sell, and it isn’t when there’s something the authors want or can easily sell you against accepting.112-113 a weird game is played with signaling. The goods that are given to signal underlying traits are said to be adaptations, and not the traits themselves. Why would someone say this? 114 men are a couple points smarter than women. The difference shows up at a specific period in development. This statement is false and has been known to be false for about 20 years (two 2002 papers. One was from Lynn and one from Nyborg). 115 “the technological basis of feminism is in place, therefore, give way to entryism.” 116 The book promotes equality under the law, even though unequal assessments are made of men and women doing the same things, and they're cut out for different things. Why worship this bad policy? This program just maliciously promotes women’s interests.117: practices some Muslims engage in are called a culturally insensitive ethnocentric term on this page, while women with multiple husbands is said to look strange to us because we're just WEIRD! Policing hypergamy is bad, but authorizing its excesses is good, says [hidden standard of morality]. 118: ""... mate choice historically being in service of the production of children..."" the absolute state. This book is so dumb.118-119: sleeping around and dumping kids on single parents isn't desirable, yet it's happening and the state wants it. Will the underlying ethic ever be stated? Still not here...Also: why promote marriage generically? Isn't that just going to ruin the men who marry women from the backgrounds that are responsible for all divorces? Not specific enough. Highly irresponsible advice in this book.Adult media is disavowed in the end which is good. 128 sexual dimorphism differs between groups, and is at least tacitly disavowed in this book, but that doesn't enter into the analysis. Monogamy is offered as being superior to poygynous systems, but it's also said that it is fragile and can break down. If it's superior, in the system of the authors, why does the other strategy invade? Why is a superior means fragile? This is better than Miller, but still silly. 132 sexual strategy changes are claimed to be about where we are in relation to carrying capacity, even though we're supposed to be the “cultural animal” and obvious social engineering is at play. Furthermore: no effort is made to account for the reproductive outcomes in African where they’re wholly dependent on k being piped in (infinitely past carrying capacity for decades). This is stupid.133 monogamy is said to be bad for birth rates which is an alleged positive. In a biology book. You can't make this up. 134 the 80% of men who are trash under the present system are beneficiaries, somehow. The bar has been lowered to the point of being ""meaningless"". I’m not making it up.

See Fr Dcn Dr Ananias's video at the Norwegian Nous youtube channel (“Refutation of Materialism via Immateriality of the intellect”). 150 now the meaning of plasticity becomes the meaning of plasticity.

Under feminism, the higher quality earlier reproductive outcomes are cut off by women being a career women and “finding themselves”. On the mutation load accumulation readily upsetting social cognition: see Lorenz’s 1965 book Evolution and Modification of Behavior. If you accumulate mutationS, and prune the better reproductive outcomes, you end up with per capita increases in disability. This has been known before ANY OF US WERE BORN.

Also this process of regime change is pretended to be wholly bottom up and not top down. Postmodernism was imposed from the very beginning.

Don't get me wrong, I do find the book instructive but the topics are discussed in a very generic way. I think they do say somewhere in the book that they kept it that way on purpose as they cannot discuss all the topics in depth in one book."
118,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"The authors argue early on that we are no longer capable of understanding and surviving the fast pace that is the modern world. They show their liberal bona fides by repeatedly talking about global environmental catastrophe. Their definition of consciousness is thought that can be communicated to others. So they offer the following theory of mind: “one truth that emerges from understanding consciousness in this way is that it makes little sense to assume that individual consciousness evolved first, or that it is the most fundamental form of consciousness. Rather, or individual consciousness likely evolved in parallel with collective consciousness, and would become fully realized only later in our revolution.” The concept of the Uni-mind of the Eternals, or was it the Inhumans of Marvel Comics comes to mind.Chapter 2 discusses the history of evolution of life on the planet.Chapter 3 begins with a discussion of the Mueller-Lyer illusion. They claim that we are no longer capable of easily distinguishing which is the shorter line because we live in houses built using dimensional lumber.They talk about how the nature versus nurture dichotomy is false but they never mention volition. There is only genetics and epigenetics.“Instead, we embrace careful application of the precautionary principle.“ Morons.There is much praise for the primitive tribes they have investigated in their professional lives.I’ll skip to chapter 10, which is called “School”. This is a mishmash of group learning empiricism, rationalism, and unschooling.From this point on they go into alarmist mode. They argue for the precautionary principle; they argue repeatedly against open markets; they argue for regulation of all industry; they argue for a less beautiful kind of world. Though they do not mention them, their favorite thinkers are: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Malthus and EF Schumacher. Would that they had read a little Austrian economics and Julian Simon. Their discussion of resources is particularly alarmist and ill-informed.I suppose it would make sense to go through this book chapter by chapter but as a matter of fact it really isn’t worth the effort. It is very much like many other books written in the last 30 years or so by scientists: what you know or what you think you know and what you do and what you plan is wrong. We will tell you why because we are experts and we know better."

122,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century- 1 . 27 . 22 -For a rough description of the book; it goes through a wide variety of different topics, from the human niche, deep into history, sleeps, all the way to becoming an adult and the future. It is meant to be a toolkit for a different view on the world, not ignoring the bad in the world, not ignoring the good, but instead understanding how things came to be and how to understand the future.There is no clear one main idea, instead, it is a mindset. A mindset that encourages you to dig deep, to go out and find the knowledge yourself instead of looking for a quick answer. They talk about a “corrective lens” at the end of every chapter that explains this a bit easier. Is there a big lesson or moral to be learned? Somewhat, as said before, it doesn’t really have one clear main idea, and instead, works as a toolkit to give you a different perspective on questions and on the world. It can be used to find answers from the source rather than from the shallow depths of the internet. What does this book teach you or what did you learn?Because it talks about such a wide variety of topics, from the very beginning to someplace in the future, I feel very informed about new topics. I feel like I can understand the process that got us to this point and how to prepare myself for the future with tiny nuggets of knowledge that I have gathered from this book.It talks about habits, it talks about simple things; medicine, food, sleep. While also making an effort to show and understand some more complex things that go a bit deeper into history; sex and gender, parenthood and relationship, childhood and adulthood.How did this book help you grow?I feel like this book can somehow build off of a growth mindset. It tells you to find the answers, to dig deep, to try to understand, and to question almost everything. At least that is what I have gathered.A growth mindset tells me to keep going, that I’ll make it one day, just possibly not yet. Whereas the mindset that I’ve gotten from here, which I’ll call the “Corrective Lens”, tells me to ask hard questions, to find answers from the source, and go come out with new knowledge.What was more compelling about this book:- The authors' style or the authors' ideas -I feel like the authors' ideas by themselves wouldn’t be very compelling, the authors' style really creates some sort of harmony which gets the ideas across in a way that I feel like almost anyone with patience can learn.By itself, the ideas for me would probably be more compelling, but I feel like it’s only because the style compliments it.What was your greatest challenge in reading this book?Probably being gathering enough patience to actually understand the ideas in the book and keep going. I feel like at times the book can go a bit deep, using scientific terms that I cannot understand…But if you spend some time connecting the dots to understand what they’re trying to get across, you can really learn quite a lot from this book, especially in some weird and wonderful areas.Did this book help you on your own Heroes Journey?I believe yes, I feel like mindset is one of the most important components of my heroes journey because it is what will keep me going. Asking good questions and finding exact answers is very important to finding my calling.I feel like looking for surface-level answers is not enough, instead, looking where the questions come from, digging deep, spending time actually finding PROPER answers is what I believe will keep me afloat, especially if I decide to do something like architecture or interior design.Would you recommend this book to a friend?Yes, but I believe that you need to be a certain age to actually read it. I think that at some times it’ll be hard for younger readers to read. It would require some patience and knowledge to read but I feel like it’s worth the time and struggle."
123,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51049384-ali-fatolahi,Rating 4 out of 5,"I've never struggled with rating a book this much. I kept swaying between 2, 3 and 4 stars. I think it's ultimately a good book to read because it covers some non-trivial aspects of evolution in an understandable language, it addresses some misconceptions that are incorrectly taken as advances in modern life, and that it sends a message about human race self destruction concerns. However, I have some reservation, which I think are also important to note when/after reading the book:1- Although almost all chapters and the entire book starts with a scientific background, the conclusions are not necessarily so. Some chapters like the one on food has a stronger connection, and some like the one on sleep not much - no matter how sound a statement is, the process of reaching there from initial findings and assumptions is not scientifically verifiable. This is where the book becomes more philosophical. The confusion becomes more severe and bit annoying on sex/gender, where the chapter in my mind does a great job covering the misconception but ends up with some shallow reasoning which not only aren't verifiable but in my mind unnecessary to the authors' message if not even harmful a bit. I mean saying for example ""No woman ever built a monument in honor of a good husband"" is not verifiable and doesn't really prove anything.2- Surprisingly, the distinction of weird and non-weird countries is in my mind seriously flawed. This is surprising because of the authors' experience in several countries. I was born and raised in a so-called non-weird country and I can tell you first-hand that with the exception of a few isolated villages and tribes, everyone in such countries depends and want to depend on what the authors call ""western"" medicine. I remember some of the so-called old wisdom. The first chance my relatives had those were abandoned in favor of modern medicine. Yes, I understand the authors are exactly advising against blindly doing that. I'm just saying that distinction doesn't exist. I'm also disappointed by the usage of ""western"" medicine, I think the authors' language and tone toward modern medicine is very unfair. And to that end they end up mentioning a few memories around broken arms and legs, which to me, is irresponsible writing considering authors' scientific credibility. What if someone took it as an advice and caused their children a serious harm?3- Practicality. What is wisdom? There is so much unnecessary stress on wisdom in this book. One example of wisdom they give is two teens were collapsed under ruins of an earthquake, they heard people were around and yelled! How could someone in a situation where both modern science and ancient wisdom have something to say, choose whether that wisdom is founded or not? One might argue that it's not for science to decide practicality and its responsibility is only to explore/explain facts. But as I laid out the book is really written with more of a journalistic approach than scientific. As much as I agree with the basic principles and general advice, I have to say from a practical point of view, one has to accept the reality that the ancient wisdom is almost useless in modern world not because it's always wrong but because it's mysterious in unknown ways, most people cannot afford to demystify it and that even when it's right it's most likely for a different reason that the ancient people thought.So, if you read this book with an analytical mind I think there's a lot to learn and also if you're on the same page with the authors - like me - that evolution is a definite fact and that we are on self-destruction path, even more reasons to read this."
124,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126207879-henrik-maler,Rating 4 out of 5,"Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying “provide an evolutionary toolkit with which to understand the human condition” and, based on that, give practical implications with which to increase the individual’s well-being in everyday life. They present insights into central and specific fields like medicine, food, sleep, sex and gender, parenthood and relationship, childhood and becoming adults, and school, but also into the broader scheme of the human existence (its niche), its history and the relationship between culture and consciousness. Furthermore, since we live in a hypernovel world to which we are partly maladapted, our survival as a species is at risk, the authors argue. Hence they propose a framework, the fourth frontier, with which to be evolutionarily successful.Can I recommend it?I can indeed recommend it.A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century is for everyone who seeks a clearer picture of the central aspects of human life in the modern world by exploring its contrast with its ancient version. If you are already familiar with central tenets of evolutionary biology such as trade-offs, adaptations, holism, you won’t learn much about evolutionary biology but the results of their application to various aspects of (modern) human life. If you already happen to take an evolutionary perspective on things such that you ask “Is this natural to do?” and align your behaviors along the lines of your answers, some elaborations made in the book and many practical implications will not surprise you.  If you, however, are still on the lookout to understand the human condition better, both in a broad and narrow sense, you will be inspired. Weinstein and Heying cover a wide range of considerations that seem vital to gain a clear picture of what it means to be human, today as well as in the past.I was unsure about giving it 4 stars in the beginning, but at a closer look, the authors definitely deserve it. It is strikingly well-written (use of terms, logical, density) and thought-provoking. It would have gained the 5th star, if I would have been less experienced with evolutionary biology, but that's on me.For starters, what did I dislike?- It was somewhat hard to follow at times (listening to it) because of its complex sentences.- On the first look, it appears as if the chapters with a general approach (1-3, 11, 12) are disconnected from the parts that deal with the specifics (4/5-11). If I have not missed it, it could have been made clear that the specifics are all meant to be examples of hypernovelty.- In some sub-chapters the authors ceased to take no evolutionary perspective at all, which I would have liked. However, listening to a discussion of higher education from a non-evolutionary perspective was still nice, because the authors make reasonable arguments.- I expected an even more general approach with a more abstract and diverse treatise. Nonetheless, the zoomed-out perspective they took did still reveal many insights in the broader scheme of things and made at least one very profound point, namely the human need for a fourth frontier.- I expected a description of the environment of our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Weinstein and Heying concentrated on the history of the lineage (Chapter 2), not the history of our environmental conditions in which we evolved.- Being fussy for a moment: Although the book “provide[s] an evolutionary toolkit with which to understand the human condition” (The Maya, 01:16), on which it succeeds, the evolutionary perspective often did not endow me with an understanding of modern phenomena that is new, unique or of distinct value to me. In some of the chapters the authors could not spark my interest by presenting novel or far-ranging ideas, connections or perspectives (Medicine, Sex and Gender, Parenthood and Relationship, Childhood, School, Becoming Adults), partly because of it’s treatise of quite specific, repetitive considerations, and partly because of, to be fair, my exposure to and fascination with the evolutionary perspective for years now. Thus, many depictions did not surprise me. I only took few notes compared with other books. However, quite a lot of interesting concepts and connections were presented (see below).What did I like, in general?I liked it, but not extraordinarily.- The structure was clear and logical.- The language and lines of argumentation were clear and logical.- It’s density. I assumed the sub-chapters dealing with a specific topic not being so rich due to its shorter lengths, but I was at miss.- The authors were careful formulating their arguments.- They provided a “corrective lens” at every chapter’s end to summarise the main points and give practical implications.- They regularly dived into the evolutionary history of things (human lineage, tools, fire and cooking, sex and gender, parenthood and relationship).- They introduced personal closeness: They made a couple of jokes, which made me chuckle, and shared personal experiences.Did the book inspire me? Did it surprise me? Did it excite other meaningful thoughts or emotions? Yes, it did inspire and surprise me at times. Some (sub)chapters I found to be interesting enough creating the urge to read them again to make sure that I did not miss something important. They presented many interesting ideas, connections and perspectives, though some were more interesting than others. I listened again to the following chapters:- Chapter 1: The Human Niche- Chapter 2: A Brief History of the Human Lineage- Chapter 5: Food- Chapter 12: Culture and Consciousness- Chapter 13: The Fourth FrontierWhich parts were the best? - Chapter 12: Culture and Consciousness- Chapter 13: The Fourth FrontierWhat did I like about the book, specifically? What did I gain?What are the specific ideas, connections and perspectives that inspired me, surprised me, caught my attention?I have made many more notes, but here are some of the points I found most interesting:- The discovery of fire may not only have served cooking to gain more calories, but also socialisation, culture and consciousness. If there was less time needed to gain calories, together one may have ""colloborated, dreamt, imagined new ways of being""...- The terms “evolutionary” and “genetic” do not mean the same and were erroneously widely used synonomously. - The Omega-Priniciple = principle opposed to the common misunderstanding that nature and nurture are two competing forces. Culture/nurture is just as affected by evolution like genes.- The fundamental relationship between culture and consciousness consists in their alternation, dependent on need for change or stability.- Cultural wisdom often is literally false, but metaphorically true. This includes astrology which has been shown to have some predictive power.- The human species is obsessed with growth. This poses an existential threat that can be dealt with The Fourth Frontier (a term coined by Weinstein and Heying).- ""The Fourth Frontier is the idea that humans can engineer and maintain an indefinite steady state that satisfies them because it feels to them as if they live in perpetual growth.""- Chesterton’s Fence = metaphor for an object which you should not change or remove before you know what it’s use is and the consequences of its removal will be.- ...Did it make me or my life better? Were there any practical implications?It did enrich me with knowledge, but it did not make my life better in a practical sense, although the authors explicitly provided a practical guide at the end of every chapter (""the corrective lense""). Some were irrelevant (e.g. parenthood), many were quite unspecific (hack your physiology: find what stimulates you) and many were already known to me (waking up with natural light rather than an alarm clock). To be fair, I have already been familiar with an evolutionary perspective on some aspects of everyday life.Did it change my view on the world?Not in a ground-breaking fashion, but yes. The key takeaways changed my view on - and the potential importance of the discovery of fire for the development of language.- systems, features and traits in general (Chesterton’s Fence),- the relationship between culture and consciousness,- culture itself, which harbours ancient wisdom encapsulated in form of stories, that may be literally false, but metaphorically true,- the modern human condition which is in a dangerous state due to the modern’s hypernovel world and desire for perpetual growth,"
125,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66799451-c-drying,Rating 5 out of 5,"WHY DID YOU READ THIS BOOK?I first learned about Bret Weinstein when he bucked the social-justice (woke) movement at Evergreen college. Later, I started watching his Darkhorse Podcast, along with his partner Heather Heying. I discovered the two are very thoughtful people who employ the scientific method and stand up to protect it. I chose to read their book because I figured it captures their worthwhile insights.WHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT THIS BOOK?I loved learning (and sometimes being reminded of what I learned in school) about biology and the evolution of life on our planet.Their information and guidance about health, food, and sleep was welcome advice, but what I liked most of all is their discussion about some of the damaging notions put forth by woke practitioners of postmodernism. For example, Bret and Heather mention, ""Postmodnernists [are] on the leading edge of promoting the view that reality is socially constructed,"" and then they write, ""You can fool a person, and they can fool you, but you cannot fool a tree or a tractor, a circuit or a surfboard. So seek out physical reality, not just social experience.""Finally, I think their view that ""sustainability must displace [the idea of market] growth as the indicator of success"" is spot on. Business models should be seeking an honest profit from repairing devices and appliances rather than promoting the idea that everyone needs the latest and greatest gadget that is by design non-repairable.Oh, by he way, my most favorite sentence out of the whole book is this one: ""Let us not romanticize any people or period.""WHAT DID YOU DISLIKE ABOUT THIS BOOK?I'd have to be pretty hard pressed to find anything I dislike about this book, especially because I feel so intellectually ill-equipped to do so. However, I think there was some advice given that was without explanation. For instance, in the corrective lens section of the chapter on food, Bret and Heather advise to, ""avoid allowing hot plastic to touch your food."" However, they don't say why other than mentioning plastic food wraps are a hyper-novelty.Oh, and I suppose I disliked seeing the ever-so brief mention of animal dissection. Evidently, Heather taught a comparative anatomy course that included dissections of sharks and cats. It seems to me students don't need to learn dissection. Dissection should be reserved only for cases that will yield valuable information and should be performed on animals that have already died of natural causes.DO YOU RECOMMEND THIS BOOK?This book should be required reading for all seniors in high school. People should read it aloud to each other and discuss it."
126,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115563970-patrick-gendron,Rating 4 out of 5,"Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein definitely know their stuff in regards to evolutionary biology and their guide provides us with some very relevant and timely principles to live by in this day and age of hyper-novelty. They remind us that hyper-novelty is caused by a rate of technological change so rapid that transitions in our environment outstrip our ability to adapt. The cognitive dissonance spawned by trying to live in a society that is changing faster than we can accommodate is turning us into people that cannot fend for ourselves. Heather and Bret provide deep insight into how to adapt a science-based worldview that will empower you to live a better, wiser life. In addition to providing a brief history of the human lineage, they go into many aspects of our lives including medicine, food, sleep, sex and gender, parenthood and relationship, childhood, school, becoming adults, culture and consciousness, and the “Fourth Frontier”. At the end of each chapter, they provide a “Corrective Lens” that offers tips you can apply in your daily life to ensure that you respond to change and adapt to the unknown. Because I am a new father, the sections on parenthood and family were especially interesting to me with reminders to do things like look at the emotions at play when you converse and “turn the sound down” and watch actions instead of just listening to words. Also, I liked the mention of encouraging alloparenting of children. I also really resonated with the idea of seeking a “Forth Frontier” beyond the original historical three (geographic, technological, and transfer of resource). The “Fourth Frontier” would address our obsession with unsustainable growth and provide a framework for engineering an indefinite steady state that will abide by the laws of physics and game theory that govern our universe. We need people to welcome the idea that some set of values need to be broadly embraced and pursued but to be adaptable because there is no blueprint. We must be willing to prototype, evaluate the results and prototype again. Bret and Heather remind us that culture is helpful in times of stability, when inherited wisdom allows individuals to prosper and spread across relatively homogeneous landscapes but that in times like now, when we are expanding into new frontiers, when innovations and interpretation, and communication of new ideas are critical, consciousness is more helpful. They provide extensive sources and the book is very informative. I really enjoyed how the don’t try to justify the human condition and instead provide an evolutionary toolkit to understand it. They do a great job of pointing out the intellectual confusion that we are going through and how important it is to understand our evolutionary baggage. "
127,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32281217-evan-micheals,Rating 3 out of 5,"I have found the evolutionary psychology lens useful in thinking about the psyche and how to ‘be’ in the world. I have been following evolutionary biologists of Heying and Weinstein since they came to my attention through Joe Rogan. Given my great interests in evolutionary psychology and knowledge of Heying and Weinstein’s public contributions I did not find a lot in this work that was unfamiliar. I saw a lot of Nassim Taleb’s work through out this book. The ‘Lindy Effect’, ‘Anti-Fragility’, ‘Black Swans’, amongst others were themes. If you have followed Taleb’s work, this will not provide a lot of new insights. I doubt Heying and Weinstein were copying Taleb, but that they have looked at the world and come to similar conclusions.The discuss monogamy, sex, childhood, parenthood, rites of passage, diet, education, gender issues, pharmaceuticals, consumerist culture, risk, from the evolutionary lens of how to be in the modern world in a clear and concise manner. I am reminded of the Jordan Petersen statement that there are infinite ways of being in the world, but finite ways that will lead you towards success. A purpose is to suggest what some of the finite strategies might be. Heying and Weinstein take a conservative view of Chesterton’s fence. You need to understand why nature and evolution put the fence there, before you tear it down (and only cautiously touch the fence until you understand what it’s purpose was).A theme is that faith in ‘scienitism’ makes us much to sure of ourselves and that a dose of humble cautiousness is in order. Don’t muck with things that are not understood, or if you must muck with them be cautious about it. I would say this reinforced and built on knowledge previously gained in other works. If you have not previously read much about evolutionary psychology/biology and its implications on modern life this will be an eye opening read."

The plan was for me to read it, then him, and then we can discuss. This is a very quick and interesting read -the only reason it took me so long was because we were busy with a lot of Fall and Winter activities. I suspect most readers will finish significantly quicker than I did. My review is intentionally vague, as I don’t like to leave spoilers and ruin first impressions for future readers.The book touched on many ideas and research I was already familiar with, while also touching on areas I was not familiar with. I found it interesting and thought provoking. I also happen to agree with much that was discussed, even if it is not the popular opinion of so many this day in age. It was refreshing to read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have already seen a few reviews from people who didn’t like it, yet I suspect it was due to being overly committed to their opinions on culture, sex, etc. and unwilling to set aside political or personal biases to appreciate the science behind their arguments. Towards the final chapter or so, there were arguments I instinctively disagreed with, yet was able to set my bias aside and see their argument for what it is. In a world that has become increasingly intolerant of what has been sound knowledge for generations, it was refreshing to see common sense making a comeback. Additionally, I enjoyed the personal touches throughout the book where they discussed their past research trips throughout the world and thought they were both very interesting, as well as provided a personal touch to a subject many may find overwhelming or boring. 10/10 recommend.

129,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Two authors mired in controversy, partially their fault, partially not, managed to put out one of the best science focused books I have read in a while. I would not file this book under ""pop sci"" as many similar books would find themselves in, as Dr. Heying and Dr. Weinstein are heavy hitters in their respective field and released this book as a cumulation of their lives as researchers and professors. A Hunter Gatherer's Guide lays out a strong hypothesis about culture existing as an epigenetic phenomenon. The book details the connection between evolution and our current society, showing how culture, genetics, and technology progress at different speeds and influence each other. We can see how the breakneck speeds of technology have severed ties with culture, and how culture is adapting at speeds which our genes are incapable. Clearly, we are facing health woes, both physical and mental, at unprecedented scales, and this book lays out a scientific view as to how we got here, and what can be done to improve our lives and the world around us.This book, like many great books, acts as Rorschach test. People with any political, social, or culture priors can interpret this book in ways which can all be true. This book is not any of those things, yet contains ideas which are the backbone of religion, progressivism, conservativism, and atheism, yet does not take any moral stances. It simply explains who we are, where we came from, and what we can learn to improve where we are at.Do not let the controversy of the authors convince you to miss out on a great work of science literature. You will not want to put this book down, and when it is over, you know that you will want to read it again."

I think even if it can be taken to an extreme that there is tremendous benefit in seeing the world through this lens. It helps explain and seems to accurately predict how people will operate in response to seemingly illogical incentives. But if you look at how we operate through the lens of humans as creatures who are trying to one up each other in a subconscious hierarchy whose rules are determined by sexual and natural selection then our actions make a lot more sense.Heather and Bret have made a career of interpreting the world through this lens. Their omega principle, which states that “any expensive and long-lasting cultural trait (such as traditions passed down within a lineage for thousands of years) should be presumed to be adaptive” is a useful principle that helps us understand what traditions are worth keeping and which ones can afford to be modified to some degree. Two very liberal professors who have been the target of the far progressive left - they have maintained their integrity because of their commitment to speaking the truth - that there is a truth that we are able to approximate with observation and testing and falsification - “ask people to believe things that are patently untrue and they will be ever less likely to form a coherent worldview, one based in observation and reality, rather than fantasy.”I think all bio teachers should read this book and anyone interested in the challenges of the 21st century and how we have chosen to interact in the world."

In America we have great faith in our medical system, education system, food supply, and out scientific systems. This book takes the Chesterton's fence approach to looking at these systems we have in America. The authors start off discussing how humans have evolved to get to the point where we are currently. They then transition into medicine and food. They discuss how modern medical marvels do help us, but also cause us harm that we tend to dismiss. The same with food. GMOs can be a good thing and a bad thing. We need to be more focused on figuring out what is actually beneficial to us and was is harming us. I especially liked the chapter on sleep because I have recently started working on creating artificial natural light patterns in my home through smart lighting and it has helped with sleep patterns greatly. This book discusses the science behind it and why the invention of the electric light isn't as great as we make it out to be.Sex, gender, and parenthood are also a big topic discussed in this book. The authors really focus on Chesterton's fence in this chapter while they ask questions about why we find gender roles oppressive and then asks what the world would be like if those gender roles were still in effect. This book does a great job asking the tough questions that no one in our society seems to want to ask. This book is a must read for anyone who likes questioning what they have always assumed to be right without actually researching it themselves."

The modern medical complex seems to be increasingly profit centered where 100 years ago it was more patient centered. There have been incredible advances in medicine and in medical procedures, but the number of children being over medicated and ignoring the root causes of why they are seen as needing pharmaceutical intervention.2. Monogamy is the best relationship style for society...better for child rearing...better for relationships in general.3. Social media and screen time in general are really having a net negative impact on us....from youth to adults.4. SCHOOLS, I have worked in secondary education for 25 years and the trend in education during that period is a massive dumbing down of the curriculum....reliance on standardized testing...trying to force compliance with Skinnarian behaviorist methodologies...where fitting into the box is sought and authentic learning is suppressed. There are more...my only real issue at all is the injunction to question everything and then framing the entire book on evolutionary theory that is anything but settled.

And the evolutionary bits are intriguing. The animal kingdom bits are intriguing. And the anthropological comparisons are appetizing. But they don’t go anywhere.Instead, the authors abandon their focus on evolutionary biology and it’s relation to modern “hyper novelty” (a matter that really does need to be explored more!) and instead start dishing out opinions related to their own lives. It becomes euro-centric, close-minded, uncurious, and undeveloped. They make really big claims using data that is either lacking or dated, they do not do the work to ask questions. The chapter on gender is kind of problematic. They cut and dry say that men and women are born that way and that’s about it, except in very limited circumstances. In reality, we all know this topic is so underexplored that’s impossible to make these claims with what new knowledge is surfacing. They also have a moment where they admonish porn as a source of something they call “sexual autism.” It’s weird (not their “weird”) and it ends up feeling really like uneducated. It also fails to acknowledge the incredible diversity that came before civilization. Particularly in respects to primitive socialism, unassigned gender roles, polyamory, and homosexuality — many matters I believe they would suggest are just “hyper novel”.Eat my ass. "

I’ve always found Evo-psychology to be a great explanation for many of our strange tendencies as humans. “Either way, modernity is doing something to us at a deeply fundamental level, and the fact that we don’t understand it is alarming.”A lot of the book focuses on how our modern lives tend to hotwire our (often) primitive nature and how we can avoid some pitfalls. Obvious mentions include limiting social media usage, getting natural light, exercise, social/communal belonging, etc. I appreciate that the authors also took the time to go into biological history. Specific mention is made of how we are still fish lmao.“Like all social, long-lived organisms with long childhoods and overlap between our generations, we need to learn how to be adults. That is different, however, from needing to be taught.”Several chapters in this book are dedicated especially to child rearing, something I found extremely useful and insightful.

They touch on many timeless topics, ranging from School to Sex and Gender, situating current issues within an evolutionary perspective. For example, they explain the purpose of the human appendix and suggest that we avoid making changes without understanding the original purpose of the item/idea to be changed.I was impressed by the way that they captured our current issues, often with witty summaries such as ""literally false, metaphorically true"" to describe many religious and cultural traditions such as astrology.Perhaps the most charming aspect of the book is the use of compelling examples from their personal lives. These are people who truly live by their values and raise their sons accordingly. One example is their avoidance of sun screen. Instead, they understand how to give the skin regular breaks from heavy sun to allow it the time it needs to heal and adapt to the sun. They offer similar examples with broken bones and natural medicine more generally.At just under 250 pages, it is remarkably short, and the potpourri inclusion of many seemingly unrelated, but complementary topics left me stunned that I had so quickly arrived at the end.

The ideas and theories proposed have stuck with me, like the way that culture and consciousness interact to influence us and to shape our evolution. Weinstein and Heying's book touches upon topics as disparate as human sexual strategies, the modern diet, child-rearing in modern cities vs. obscure undeveloped villages, insomnia and dreaming, and behaving like an adult. While controversial, it loops back again and again compellingly to the central theme of why we behave as we do and why it is is imperative that we contrive long-term solutions to the urgent problems facing our planet and species. Their controversial Omega Principle, the theory that ""Cultural evolution is superior to genetic evolution because it allows adaptation to proceed orders of magnitude faster"" while being ""inferior to genetic evolution because it must serve genomic interests,"" as Bret has written, really forces you to think about how nature and nurture interact. Also compelling is the idea that any longstanding cultural tradition that has stood the test of time but isn't yet fully understood may be adaptive. They are not advocating Luddism or going backwards, but rather proceeding with caution so as not to lose hidden benefits when we discard the old for the new in a rapidly changing modern world.

Its lessons on the value of tradition and even superstitions are rather important especially in the third-world, where the tension between tradition and modernity continues to kick conflicts.

It also has some interesting chapters on how to raise kids, sprinkled with the authors' personal experiences.All in all, this is one of the most elegant (non-fiction) audiobooks I have listened to, given the knack that Heather and Bret have for narration already. I do not feel there were any shortcomings in the content of the book, but it could explore some daring evolutionary ideas.

I found the anti-fragile impulse applied to education, maturation, and parenting refreshing. The issue at the heart of the book is hypernovelty and the difficulty modern people are having with the rate and magnitude of change. Biological organisms in complex systems demonstrate patterns and these patterns as well as human history point to the current and imminent need to collectively employ the adaptive capacity of humanity to distill signal from noise, find balance between culture and consciousness, and recognize that limitless growth on a planet with finite resources is not possible. Consciousness, specifically collective consciousness, as the driver of the 4th Frontier, in which we not only avoid demise at our own hands but advance forward? Evolutionary, indeed."
140,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10480648-julie,Rating 4 out of 5,"An engaging read, thoroughly researched and presented in an accessible way. It would’ve been fun to have one or both of them as professors in college. I appreciated the distinction that Functional Biologists study the how and what of organisms, whereas Evolutionary Biologists study why. Is a particular trait adaptive? If so, what does it do for that organism? Their discussion of the appendix’s role in maintaining a healthy biome is fascinating. Early on, in Chapter 2, they give a brief history of our species to illustrate that humans collaborated with one another to gain control over their environment, then competed for further dominance. “We cooperate to compete,” oscillating between two challenges: ecological dominance and social competition. We became expert at exploring and switching niches. We are, by our very nature, a migratory species. (This point is made brilliantly by the author Mohsin Hamid in his novel, Exit West.) I enjoyed learning about tradeoffs, including the zero-sum allocations of biology (e.g., if a deer grows a bigger set of antlers, he has to borrow from somewhere—lose bone density or eat more) and design constraints (e.g., you can’t eat or add more to solve a problem like robustness, which must come at a cost to agility). Trade-offs drive evolution to diversity. This is important to understand, because somewhere along the line humans decided we are exempt from these rules. We can enlist others to increase our abilities: e.g., horses allow us to move faster. We seem to have beaten the odds on the trade-offs between specialists and generalists. For now.The authors say, sure, humans are clever. “Cornucopianism’ imagines a world so full of both resources and human ingenuity that we can eliminate trade-offs as if by magic. We are blinded by the richness and opulence of our short-term gains. Yet the trade-offs are still there. The sea level rise of climate change will plague future generations, and it’s here now for poorer, closer-to-sea-level people.They coin a term to define us: WEIRD, which means Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. And, whether we’re aware of it or not, trade-offs for our way of life abound. Our bodies are evolutionarily ancient and highly adapted to climate, place, and seasons. Yet we’re surrounded by hyper-novelty that often runs counter to that exquisite dynamic balance. A fascinating example: our sense of smell detects putrefaction to warn us away from rotten food and corpses. The odors themselves are not toxic, but eating or contact will make us sick. In contrast, solvents often smell good (like a Sharpie marker or airplane glue)—yet, even breathing the fumes can be toxic or deadly. Reading this book, I kept imagining what it would be like to have the authors as parents. When their son broke his hand or, later, his arm, they gave him a brace instead of a cast. Keep the bones in use, under stress, the way nature intended, so they can heal back strong, not weak. They’re also anti-vitamins, as my own mother was. Get all your nutrition from food. Whole foods and whole cuisines have holistic benefits that most nutritionists don’t study, because they can’t be reduced to micro-levels. Michael Pollan’s been on this for years.The difference between evolution and genetics is interesting. Our failure to understand this has led to what they call the “specious” debate of “nature versus nurture.” The answer is nearly always both: the Omega Principle says that genes and epigenetic phenomena such as culture are inextricably linked and evolved together to advance the genes. Cultural evolution is faster than genetic evolution, usually messy at first until it has a chance to catch on. It can spread horizontally and also vertically through generations, as the wisdom of proven patterns is passed from elders to youth. Traditionally, innovation emerged collectively, was tested, and then packaged into highly transmissible culture if it proved useful. In times of accelerating change and innovation, it becomes difficult to sort what is useful and relevant. Especially when at least some of that cultural “wisdom” is based on misunderstandings of our fit and relationship with the natural world—as is the case today. Chapter 12 defines culture. and consciousness as inverse modes that we move between. discusses innovation in times of great upheaval: “In times of stability, when inherited wisdom allows individuals to prosper and spread across relatively homogeneous landscapes: Culture reigns. But in times of expansion into new frontiers, when innovation and interpretation, and communication of new ideas, are critical: Consciousness reigns.” They propose three contexts to organize a cultural response to the push-pull of received ancestral wisdom (status quo) and the change necessary to adapt to different conditions. First is the “utterly new idea,” such as the invention of farming or the wheel, which, before they came along, nobody knew were possible. The second context is innovation from a model, such as when the Wright brothers invented flight based on observing birds. Third is instruction, with a model and a set of rules or instructions. This third type is the most “cultural,” involving received wisdom. “By contrast, humans are at our most conscious, and therefore our most innovative, in the first two contexts.”They advise, when faced with a question of innovation and novelty, to use the Precautionary Principle. Consider the risks. Where the degree of uncertainty of outcomes is high, tread carefully or not at all. The chapters on specific topics challenge modern notions of illness, medicine, and health; food; education; child-rearing; sex and gender; parenthood and relationships; culture. Each chapter has a “corrective lens”—advice from that theme on how to behave in ways that are more aligned with evolution and biology. Our brain can look into the future, even if our evolutionary biology cannot."

It was also a painful read -- the parts on parenting -- putting a microscope or binoculars on my own upbringing, and how sloppily I raised my daughter.

That there are many things that we may not understand their purpose for, but that does not make them purposeless.

We're living in this strange world where we are more prosperous than ever with almost unimaginable technological power. But despite the exponential gains in wealth and know-how, our wellbeing is going in the opposite direction. In ""A Hunter Gatherer's Guide to the 21st Century"", Bret & Heather Weinstein try to explain why by dissecting our modern ills through an evolutionary lens. Their reasoning is as follows: humans spent upwards of 95% of our history as hunter gatherers and we still have almost identical ""hardware"" to what we had then. Yes, we're incredibly adaptable, but the pace of change in modernity has far outstripped our ability to evolve. It's sort of like transporting a monkey into a modern city - we're now faced with an ""evolutionary mismatch"" where we are ill equipped to handle the novel stimuli in our environment. Based on our evolutionary heritage, we are effectively homeless in the modern world. One of the ways this problem manifests itself is the ""sucker's folly"" -- humans tend to maximize short term pleasures at the expense of long term benefits because we evolved during times of greater scarcity. Take the case of food: humans have a compulsive desire to binge eat due to food scarcity. Modern food manufacturers have capitalized on this with processed foods engineered to trigger addictions & overeating. Getting back to real foods we're more ""adapted to eat"" is one potential cure for modern health issues. Bret & Heather apply a similar evolutionary lens to everything from gender, to sex to sleep. According to them, by studying evolution, we can dissect and solve our problems. Their broad prescriptions include a combination of remodeling your own life to respect your evolutionary heritage and then reshaping society at large to help encourage this individual liberation. As for specifics, however, they are hesitant to provide any other than suggesting that their ideal society would be some sort of cross between a libertarian Galt's Gulch and Mayan Civilization.ReflectionBret & Heather nail a few things: our society is profoundly sick and I think many of the issues can be explained by the evolutionary mismatch. Superficially, fake food, fake lighting, fake medicine, etc are contributing to a number of problems. But at an even deeper level, a la Kazynski, fake, surrogate activities are hollowing us out, destroying all meaning and purpose. The solutions Western society provides are all reductionistic, reducing human wellbeing down to singular proxies that we assume constitutes the health of the entire system (i.e. providing SSRIs for depression, an extremely complex problem that isn't just reducible to serotonin deficiencies). This thinking pervades everything, especially health which I am most familiar with. The human is assumed to be a mechanistic, genetically determined machine like a car, instead of the complex, adaptive organism that we are. One of the keys to escaping from the ills of modernity probably rests in restoring the complexity and idiosyncrasy of human experience. However, I think it will require so much more than they suggest.The problem with their take is I think they too are reducing our experience to materialistic, genetic ends. The evolutionary argument definitely helps to identify and isolate certain problematic features of modernity. However, I think they are making a very risky assumption using it as a ""theory of everything"" for human life. Evolution may help to explain some of the mismatches, but it cannot explain the deeper questions of life like where love & religion fit in, why beauty is important and how to live our life. Nor can it help to solve the meaning crisis we face today. That is what philosophy and virtue ethics are for, a la Macintyre. Without which, we will continue to fall into these Nietszchean power struggles, even if we reconstruct our environment to one that's more evolutionarily appropriate. What Buddhism and the Eastern traditions nail is that the problem is never just with the external world and salvation will not come via manipulating the external environment .The human challenge can only be solved by changing our consciousness and our dispositions -- often times aided by the external environment, but not totally because of it. The sucker's folly that Bret describes is just maya in Buddhism -- an innate tendency to attach to external things borne of egoic identification. Although it definitely may accentuate it, I don't think this is a problem with our current environment, per se, but a general human challenge. The other major piece they fail to touch on is how they'd deal with technology in their ""fourth frontier"". The vexing problem with technology is its tyrannical tendency and the challenge that we face is that it may not be possible to just slightly roll it back in modern society given all the vested interests. Therefore, so long as there is completely libertarian, individualistic freedom, it may be impossible to resist the gravity of technology. Counter to the prevailing belief that democracy and freedom are synonymous, we may need a stronger government to actually give us the freedom we desire.Existential problems will continue to threaten us so long as we do not transcend our materialistic machinery, develop virtues, and come together on shared societal goals. Changing the external environment will just place a shiny new coating on the bars of our current prison. It's one thing to grant that evolution gives us certain predispositions. But another to use it as a telos for how to live. Ultimately, this feels like fodder for the new atheist tribe -- the idea that we are just replicating machines hellbent on survival. It's a particularly disempowering view of the human experience and I don't think can provide the real meaning and beauty we all yearn for out of life."

Heying and Weinstein discuss these issues as they relate to medicine, sleep, sex & gender, Parenting, childhood, and becoming an adult. "

Looking forward for a Romanian translation as soon as possible, so I can recommend it to many other people I know.I read the book on kindle, and while reading I would now and then photograph and send to some of my friends passages that seemed particularly relevant or instructive to me (e.g. like the one about the Omega Principle).I should also mention that I'm watching the Darkhorse Podcast every Saturday, since the early days of the coronavirus burst of 2020, and I wouldn't miss an episode for anything else. Keep up the good work! The world definitely needs more people like you..."

I quickly became so interested in their level headed, factual based information, that became a subscriber and supporter of them. When I heard this book was coming out, I not only downloaded it onto my ipad; but, bought several signed copies for Christmas presents for my young adult children. Their ability to scientifically explain the events and how we have arrived at where we are is amazing…. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to gain some insight into the world around us and how to best navigate it."

The science of evolutionary biology is a quite illuminating lens on how to deal with modern life its dizzying pace of change. It pushed me to consider how culture, tradition, and even religion can all be viewed as evolutionarily based and how that is a good thing as those, despite being hundreds or a couple of thousand years old, evolve faster than genes. That said, the social changes we are seeing are disrupting even the faster evolving mechanisms. I do like the prescriptions at the end of each chapter, I found them insightful and some of them personally challenging. "

I admire more than anything the intellectual consistency and honesty required to develop the thought technologies and tools given here, and the readiness of two true scientists to place them in the hands of the next generation. These thinkers do just that, and encourage their eager bearers:“Run, and find out.” "

I recommend you listen to the show for a couple of hours of soothing reinterprentation of what science can be, instead of what it's popularly seen to be.What if we looked at humanity's big current problems as being too successful evolutionarily?[A] wide-ranging view is necessary if we are to understand the biggest problem of our time: Our species’ pace of change now outstrips our ability to adapt. We are generating new problems at a new and accelerating rate, and it is making us sick—physically, psychologically, socially, and environmentally. If we don’t figure out how to grapple with the problem of accelerating novelty, humanity will perish, a victim of its success.Our technology, science and cultural adaptations have brought us to a point where we feel we can stand alone and separate from our biological roots, masters of our own destiny where no attention need be paid to what connects us to the world's higher (and lower) animals. These two evolutionary biologists with several lifetimes' worth of field experience suggest ways in which we have ""lost our way"" - and how we might find it back.I see lots of criticism here about the details of their science, but it's the spirit of their science and the problems that it's trying to address that really counts. Plus, it's funny how they describe themselves as ""liberal"" but I can easily see many liberals finding problems with the ideology of A Hunter-Gatherer's Guide. Personally, I always enjoy a book that's not afraid to pick fights with everyone - everyone gets to learn something new this way.I really liked the final chapter that deconstructed the concept of growth and its central position in most of modern civilization's problems. I've always said that degrowth is the only realistic way to go about creating a sustainable future, but nobody's talking about that...I'll leave you with some of my favorite quotes from the book.Never read anyone describing language like this:We can accurately pass a complex abstraction from one mind to another by simply vibrating the air between us. It is everyday magic that usually passes without our notice.The limits of our senses are the limits of our world - so how can these limits be further limited by our artificial environments?Carpentered corners create greater susceptibility to certain optical illusions. Overreliance on chairs creates all manner of negative health outcomes. What, then, might deodorants and perfumes have done to our ability to smell the signals emitted by our bodies? What might lives filled with clocks have done to our sense of time? What have airplanes done to our sense of space, or the internet to our sense of competence? What have maps done to our sense of direction, or schools to our sense of family? You get the point.What are the hidden costs of growth?Think you’ve found a solution that is too good to be true? Look hard for the hidden costs.Great advice for an over-medicated world:Even the great victories of Western medicine—surgery, antibiotics, and vaccines—have been overextrapolated, applied in many cases where they shouldn’t be. When all you have is a knife, a pill, and a shot, the whole world looks as though it would benefit from being cut and medicated.These are my people!When you see a paradox, keep digging.Why eternal life might not be the best idea:Human minds have a capacity. In order not to fill up with ephemera, we must forget almost everything, a process that leaves us unreliable witnesses to the events of our own lives. At very advanced ages even the most cogent among us have decidedly fragmented cognition. How much more destructive would the process be if it had to budget for centuries?It's true - groundbreaking science is impossible if no ground is actually broken. And that usually implies ridicule and contempt:Those who quickly join in laughing at all fringe ideas now would have been laughing at all of those ideas in their time.Finally, a word on how passion, obsession and addiction are close cousins:Positive obsession has many words in English: passion, focus, drive. The primary manifestation of negative obsession, of pathological obsession, is addiction."

Specifically gender differences but several other hot-button topics as well. In short:* Sit around camp fires more often. * Beware of drastic sudden social changes. * We live in a hyper-novel world that we are not adapted to which causes physical and emotional hurt. * Strive for sustainability over constant growth. * Get outside more. Take more risks as humans are anti-fragile. **But don't come home in a box!**Other notes:* Some hunter-gatherer tribes don't have issues with some optical illusions that we do (for example the two lines with the arrow in which one appears longer is apparently that's due to our novel modern circumstances environment as opposed to theirs. The question then becomes how many other modern things have caused our senses to be dulled or not work as they once did but once did. How does perfume and deodorant affect our sense of smell? How do Clocks affect your sense of space and time?* Apply The Precautionary principle - recommend caution when risk is high from a novel innovation especially where the degree of uncertainty from outcome is high. (Sexual Identity among youths is one example)* Progressiveness makes sense during difficult times - things need to be changed. Conservatism makes sense during good times - preserve the good as much as possible.* The Modern medical systems is where you give Pharmaceuticals that often cause new problems and mask the real issue rather than cure the actual problems.* There is no one universally good diet because of different populations and different places we lived. There's no one specific perfect diet.* There are 3 foods that were designed on purpose to be eaten: milk (nourish baby), fruit (spread seeds), and nectar (pollinate via bees)* Birth control while conferring some positives to women has also impacted them negatively because it reduces their value to men and cause men to be much more reluctant to commit. It undercuts their bargaining position with respect to long term commitment. (why buy the cow... ).For men it has some negatives also - the sex is no longer ""hard earned"" and indicative of high value (being deemed worthy). It is""junk sex"" without depth.* Women are wired to fall in love with those they have sex. Sex, babies, and commitment are evolutionary and inextricably linked for them. Orgasm in women releases Oxytocin which promotes bonding (in men Vassopressin is released and promotes bonding as well).* Emotions - especially things like grief - are not exclusive to just two humans. Many mammals also clearly have the capacity for emotions and grief.* When a child hits a so-called Benchmark does not mean how successful they are going to be in the future. We focus too much on these benchmarks (first smile, first time they walk, talk, etc...) to be an indicator of future success when it's not correct.* Sexual reproduction is needed in changing environments because the ability for mutations due to sexual reproduction allows the offspring of person or animal to adapt (evolve) over time.* Changing someone's opinion doesn't change reality. it's like Wile E coyote until he looks down gravity doesn't apply.* Appreciate the value of close calls!* Fight For Whom and what you love and believe in instead of fighting and spending energy against what you hate. Kind of like Bryan Caplan's ""make your own Bubble"" idea.* Honor recurring rituals. They bring together family and have important social benefits. The reasons behind them are usually mythically true even if not factually true - I think Jordan Peterson covers this idea also: The Bible is mythically true even if the actual events didn't happen). For example Monthly New Moon rituals nurture starting fresh/trying again/ falling but getting back up anew. The Sabbath nurtures family bonding and putting aside technologies like phones and TV's. Look at the value behind the ritual and not necessarily the actual belief system.* Covid-19 is a disease of Hyper Novelty. It spread due to indoor spaces - buildings, homes, ships, airplanes not from outdoor exposure which is what all our ancestors had. And it traveled globally at a super fast pace due to airplanes and quick transportation."

Many times throughout the book, I had to ask myself  exactly what does this have to do with evolution?The book has an evolutionary basis, but this ‘evolutionary science’ then goes on to somehow support the authors’ own philosophies and opinions. The authors were so excessively aggressive with some ideas that it seems to be just their own opinion. One of the worst example is when the authors referred to porn as “sexual autism” (although the authors stated that they mean no offence to people with autism). Still seems unduly offensive. The authors also talk about ‘one night stands’, which the authors argue against, describing it as “tend[ing] to come with some deceit”, “diminishes the sexual power of women”, and “create conditions in which everyone is behaving like men at their (second) worst. It’s not as bad as rape, obviously”. Okay, I’m a taken a back, but also what does this have to do with evolution? The authors have a tendency to express their own opinions, seemingly grounded in evolutionary science. This became especially obvious when the authors threw shade an incident that occurred at their workplace, “faculty bullies had indoctrinated students”, then talking about how “being an adult...means not abdicating responsibility”. Again, what does that have to do with evolution?It was a bit like almost all the book, the authors would say “x is bad because we do it now but our ancestors didn’t do it. This is because...[elaborate reasoning that is not subject to normal scientific testing or backed up by evidence]”. For example, the authors state that seeing childhood photos are damaging as “children are now competitions with earlier versions of their own selves”. Perhaps there was scientific evidence to support their claims, but in the book,  there was little to no empirical studies to support these claims. Also, the authors did not outline the limitations of their claims, or consider any contrary claims/evidence. Other claims were outright wrong, “so, does a butterfly remember how to be a caterpillar? It does not. There is no need for a butterfly to remember its caterpillar life” so the authors reasoned that just like butterflies, humans do not necessarily need to remember how they felt as children, and thus do not need online photo albums. However, a 2008 Georgetown University experiment concluded that yes, moths and butterflies actually do remember certain experiences as a caterpillar. I get that isn’t the main idea, but it is something that a simple google search would tell them whether they are right or wrong. But they didn’t do it. It makes me question the reliability of the larger ideas that require even more research. Just because an experience/environment is different to our hunter gatherer ancestors does not mean it is necessarily causing harm to us now. The authors often use the hunter gatherer’s way of life as the gold standard for existence and living our own lives.Did they consider that perhaps modernity is actually doing good for us in some aspects of our lives such as in medicine? That humans are actually living longer and healthier than ever before? When breaking bones, they suggest we should “consider...what must have been the case when our ancestors on the Savannah’s broke bones”. The authors state that after some of our ancestors broke their bones, “some died”, but that’s besides the point, right? Because guess what? “Some didn’t”(!), and thus, you should consider not taking anti-inflammatory medication, and pain medication. I hate when authors use anecdotes as supporting evidence, but then they do. They use their son when he resisted most of the traditional methods of treating a broken arm , and a few weeks later, he was better. Sorry, but the story of your son is not enough turn the whole medical industry upside down. I believe there could be evidence supporting your claims but where is it? (I couldn’t find any in the Notes section). I would only recommend this book for people with a solid basic understanding of evolution, so you know what to internalise and what to sift out. Overall, I honestly still quite enjoyed the book though but many fundamental flaws."

Los que se rinden ante los pronósticos adversos no dejarán importa.

[Primera alerta de transfobia... pero sigue].La infancia es un periodo de exploración y formación de la identidad. Así pues cuando los niños afirman que su sexo no es el suyo, no deberíamos darle más importancia, ni considerarlo nada más que un juego y una búsqueda normal de los límites. Es cierto que existen personas intersexuales, así como transexuales. Sin embargo, son increíblemente raras, y buena parte de la ""ideología de género"" es peligrosa y contagiosa. Además, muchas de las intervenciones hormonales o quirúrgicas son irreversibles.

Very split on this one.Lost a star for the authors just being annoying know-it-alls, and another for pseudoscience. The premise: humans have acquired adaptations over thousands of years that have helped us to not only survive but thrive by allowing us to master countless niches. The surrounding world has rapidly changed in the last 100 years, much faster than our adaptations can catch up to, meaning some of them are vulnerable to being overstimulated or disregulated, leading to unintentionally counterproductive outcomes.The first few chapters are actually a delightful cook's tour of evolution and how we came to be where we are today. They explore what adaptations are, how to recognise them, and why some have persisted, for example lactase in Caucasian populations allowing us to absorb calcium in times of low vitamin D exposure, which is absent in Scandinavian populations due to them getting excess vitamin D from local cod. There are many great examples of similar adaptations misaligning with the modern world, and relate to the usual suspects: food (ultra processed food, general surpluses), exercise (sedentary lifestyles), sleep (late night blue light), etc.Their parenting advice is mixed. Pushing children to be antifragile, open minded and inquisitive thinkers, and self-sufficient are all reasonable expectations, but they also extend pretty far into free-range parenting and anecdotal advice, including letting broken bones heal without casts. This, as well as their aversion to most medicine (always referred to as ""pharmaceuticals"") including all antidepressants (""sedative""), stimulants for ADHD (plain old ""speed"") and even sunscreen (??) made me do a little digging on their backgrounds, which unearthed an unsurprising aversion to covid vaccines and a vocal support for ivermectin. Very disappointing for self declared scientists that abide by first principles.They are also obsessed with raising children in the Amazon rainforest to promote self-reliance and critical thinking skills, and seem to think modern school is unnecessary for most people despite most jobs transitioning towards requiring higher education. I feel bad for their kids to be honest. They also promote barefoot walking, are anti fluoridation of water, anti all GMO, anti smartphone, anti casual sex... all things good and fun get a blanket ban as we haven't had time to adapt to them / haven't come around because of adaptation and therefore might be dangerous. This all raises the question of how far back to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle we should return to, what aspects are advantageous and which are potentiality harmful. The authors themselves acknowledge that paleo diets are essentially a sham as paleo folk have been recorded eating roots and grains, so I am surprised at their pushback against modern medicine given their scientific background. Their views on transgenderism (essentially that it shouldn't be encouraged as kids' brains haven't developed) are unsurprising and slightly controversial, as again they don't acknowledge that there may be biological aspects to some transgenderism (I will leave this can of worms unopened). All in all, this book was useful in highlighting how our bodies have adapted to a very specific environment from which we have rapidly departed. I am not sure I agree that we need to return to this world in any great hurry, although it has made me think more about the way in which the modern world has impacted our bodies and minds, and that this may not always be in a positive manner."

There story of wanting to swim and ignoring a local's warning of recent rainfall in the mountains (causing flooding down below) just made me question their intelligence, as well as suggest that they were quite arrogant and stubborn. This is seen throughout where they share their ideas, find specific studies to help support their rationalizations, despite the studies being from decades ago. They definitely put in a lot of work to include a lot of references, but there was still a lot of points without any references, which should just be taken as knowledge from their expertise I guess? Even though some things had nothing to do with evolutionary biology but rather just sounded like biased thoughts.They did have some generally good advice. I honestly found it odd that their ""The Corrective Lens"" sections at the end of each chapter did not always connect with their discussions throughout the chapter. I am definitely jealous by all the trips they have been able to do with students to give them great experiences of what is outside of our little bubbles we grow up in. However, despite this, you can tell they have preconceived views of how they believe everyone should act and be, as seen whenever they talk about ""WEIRD"" people doing certain things or assuming the general projection for humans is when ""Babies are born. Children become adults. Adults get married and have children of their own. People die."" That is just too simplistic, not to mention marriage is more of a societal thing, not evolutionary...They mention the lack of science literacy and mistakes made by many people when talking about science. However, they fall for the same mistakes. On p64, they talk about the correlation that some studies have found between fluoride in drinking water with certain health issues like neurotoxicity in children or hyperthyroidism. They then mistaken make it seem like causation, rather than just correlation... When you look at the studies they reference, they are for children in China and adults in Canada, which means there is a limited population of people that were looked at, as well as their being many other possibilities that could tie into these health issues that cannot be just tied down to one thing. Which is odd because they mention that every individual is different and that modern medicine fails to help everyone, so I do not get how they decide to make generalizations for some things, but then bash other things. Cherry picking data is very common throughout. I was also disappointed in their first reference listed being a YouTube video lecture by his brother...I definitely wouldn't like to meet them in person because they seem quite condescending, but they did introduce some new concepts I hadn't considered before. I just wish they would have presented them in a less biased manner. The later chapters became a bit politically driven, with them trying to describe culture in an evolutionary way that did not make sense to me at all."

I think I wanted a guide to hunter-gatherering for the 21st century, but Bret and Heather have plenty of interesting insights into how the world we find ourselves in is very different from the one our ancestors evolved in, and how to mitigate the maladaptive practices that have been habituated in us moderns.My only criticism of the book is that it sacrificed depth for breadth. The topic on food alone deserved a full book. I understand the authors were providing a survey to support their thesis, summarized above, but after every chapter I felt myself wanting more. I also had trouble following their arguments in a few places. Some sections, such as whether animals have consciousness or if our pets love us, were interesting, but didn't add to the thesis of the chapters they were in. I think Heather or Bret had written such sections before knowing where they would go in the book. Sometimes paragraphs within sections didn't lead naturally to the next. A reference to land theft throughout human history and across cultures didn't transition seamlessly into a section about the Mayas, other than to serve as a reminder not to romanticize people or periods of the past before mentioning something admirable about the Mayas. Jordan Peterson, who wrote a blurb on the back cover, and whom I also admire, also goes off on long tangents, but his seem to flow more naturally from his stream-of-conscious communication style, not shoehorned in where they would seem to fit. I might be the only one bothered by this as I take copious notes on every book I read (38 hand-written pages on this one!).Despite my mild frustration with the flow of the book, I found it informative and useful. I have already incorporated some of their ""corrective lenses"" in my life. As an anthropology major and something of a crank, I was predisposed to be drawn to their arguments and prescriptions. I have seen enough interviews with Bret and Heather and have listened to clips from the DarkHorse podcast from the beginning, so I enjoyed being able to hear their voices in my head as I read the book. I think I can reliably guess who wrote which parts. Whenever an idea would be followed with a punchy, emphatic phrase, I heard Heather. Whenever a paragraph started with something like, ""This is true for # of reasons..."" and then proceeded to lay out the reasons with ""First... the second reason..."" I knew that was Bret.I certainly think this book is useful enough to recommend to my friends and family. I will keep my copy to give to my daughter when she is old enough, along with

163,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"So this is honestly a very weird book. It starts off in a promising manner, by promising to track how through the lens evolutionary biology and pointing out how some of those adaptations have made us maladjusted to today's society. Instead of arguing that the adaptations need to be overcome, they make arguments the corrective actions that ought to be taken to align us more with our nature. Sounds good initially and it delivers on this promise for about a third of the book...When it starts to drift away from the promise of the evolutionary lens to more opining about today's society. As the book examines more of today's societal issues, the book provides less and less insight from evolutionary biology and making wide unsupported assertions. That's one of my biggest gripes about this book is that some of the corrective actions argued by this book are frankly unsupported by the arguments made in their relevant sections. Its not that the conclusions or actions to take are disagreeable, its that they are poorly argued. In the section regarding sleep, one of their left field corrective actions are to walk around more using the moon's light, after a chapter where the moon's light was never asserted to be key for human sleep or human life. Just asking the obvious question, where does this corrective action come from the previously provided facts?Some of it also just lazy. They assert that flouridating water is obviously needless because if humans were meant to have flouride to protect their teeth we would have adapted to gain more flouride through other sources. I am not an evolutionary biologist, but even I know that evolution does not always provide beneficial adaptations just because it is useful. Human's famously are unable to synthesize their own vitamin c, having adapted away from it compared many other plants and animals. Surely extending their previous logic, would the authors not argue that were humans meant to have vitamin c they would not have synthesized it?Around the same time the book gets off track, the book also adopts a more pompous and righteous tone in its writing. It makes has this kind of weirdly holier than thou attitude about how they have made choices in their own lives compared to the Western Society at large and becoming guilty of viewing some other third world cultures of a noble savage idealism. Particularly galling to me as an Ecuadorian was their admiration of a 4 year old in Ecuador crossing a busy street by themselves as a great show of their independence. Even in Ecuador, an unacommpanied 4 year old crossing a busy streeet isn't really seen as a normal thing!In conclusion, a large portion of this book's middle deviates significantly from the initial early promise of this book and my enjoyment, not to mention my nerves, were severely tested by this. It falls into the more common pop science, pseudo intellectual level of more readily accessible books."

If vague, sentimental speculation and startlingly specific assertion combined with hairshirt mea culpa float your boat, you may love this. I knew I was in trouble when an ur-ancestor moving from Beringia (the Bering strait landmass) into the American continent and deciding to eat fish, needed to be named. In the following passage notice the tremendous amount of work the words ‘might’ and ‘can’ and ‘most’ are doing.This strikes me as horoscope level social history. - Vague enough to cover a lot of bases and weirdly specific enough and flattering so that some items are bound to resonate.“Several generations in, sitting around the fire at night, a bit hungry because berry season was past its peak and the deer had grown scarce, one of these early Americans, call him Bem, might have observed that bears seem to sustain themselves on the fish, so why can’t we?  Bem didn’t know much about fish, though, not like Soo, who had spent many days at river’s edge, watching fish, and had insight about how the fish behaved. Soo’s insight about fish was, heretofore, not one she had shared, nor one that had seemed to her likely to have any value to her people. Soo, in turn, may not have had latent engineering skills, as Gol did, and Gol may have lacked Lok’s talent in experimenting with making rope. When so many people with distinct talents and insights come together around a camp fire to discuss a shared problem, the spark of innovation can spread quickly. Most of the best ideas that our species has generated, the most important and powerful ideas, have been the result of a group of people who had different but consilient talents and vision, non-overlapping blind spots, and a political structure that allowed for novelty.”What might keep me reading is the the hope the author will imagine the social campfire conversation in which Bem and Soo remember deciding to rape and kill the Neanderthals utilizing Gol’s new innovation the spear, engage in cannibalism and hunt the California turkey to extinction as it gathers around diminishing water sources during a hundred year drought. But that might not be the myth and magic she is going for.“Our species is brainy and bipedal, social and talkative. We make tools, cultivate land, produce myth and magic. We have reinvented ourselves over time and across space, over and over again, learning to dominate one habitat after another.”"

The next 10 pages displayed several lineage charts of plants, fungi, insects, sharks, salamanders, birds, whales, up to monkeys and apes, all of which was exceedingly boring for a layperson. However, chapter 7 “Sex and Gender” was interesting and enlightening. Modern society is definitely struggling with these issues, especially porn and sexual strategies. This was a important chapter to be considered. I’m 45, and I can’t imagine how my world view may have been warped if I had such easy access to the internet as a teen, and the deep infinite depravity of online porn. I fear for anyone who may end up dating people who consume vast amounts of unrealistic online porn. It’s definitely scary on a societal level to think of how far porn has escalated from nudie playing cards of the 40’s / 50’s to the endless daily emails in your spam folder: “enlarge your…..”, “let’s hook up on ***kbook”, “singles in your area”…. and on and on. The rest of the book is sprinkled with generalizations about modern society (screens are bad, corporate greed, modern education is awful, climate change, etc), interwoven with the author’s various travel stories and personal anecdotes. The writing style was a bit pretentious and often confusing to me. I prefer conversational plain language where I can almost hear the author’s voice speaking, this book was written like a dissertation. The book kept referring to, but I never really understood, the distinction between adaptations that were theorized to be cultural and which were supposedly genetic…though I don’t know if it even really matters? Again, I do like the authors overall when I’ve heard them on podcasts, highly intelligent and great interviews, but you can get all you need to know from this book by just reading the bullet points at the end of each chapter in my humble opinion.

I was curious to see how evolutionary biologists would address many issues faced in contemporary society, and why some of these issues may be unique to modern-day humans.I found that the first half of the book was worthwhile, as it went into more detail, and relayed back to the main focus - novelty and evolution. Throughout the second half of the book, I couldn't help but feel frustrated at the authors, for not elaborating enough on certain points, (such as technology, or consumerism and how they may create problems for us (given that our brains are not much different to how they were thousands of years ago)).I feel like the authors didn't give enough justice to many of the topics presented in this book. What would have made this book better, is presenting research to back up their claims. What the reader is met with, however, are anecdotes about the authors' family life and university. To me, this really undermined the credibility of this book, as the authors seemed to place THEIR experience and knowledge as the ultimate authority in relation to distinguishing and providing solutions for modern-day problems. If I were curious about parenting, I would read a book about parenting. In my opinion, the authors went on unnecessary tangents about their children, which I daresay, were not as useful or interesting as the authors themselves would have assumed.Lastly, something that felt frustrating about this book, were the poorly connected arguments and points made throughout all of the chapters. I wish that the authors would instead have chosen a handful of topics and elaborated on them, with the use of clear language. Instead, Heather and Bret jumped from topic to topic, without really explaining the link between thus topics, or elaborating on why they could be problematic. Once again, the authors hardly ever returned to the topic of this book (why modern challenges are problematic exclusively for humans). Instead, they often wrote about non-human animals, which misses the point of this book entirely.Overall, despite having potential, this book was extremely disappointing. The authors frequently went off topic, and did not elaborate on many of the points that they made. If you are looking for a self-help guide with traces of pseudo-science, then this is the book just for you."

I found the premise interesting (essentially that life has changed so fast in the post industrial age that we have vastly outpaced evolution and our bodies are struggling to keep up hence the fact that so many of us struggle with modern life) and I liked the idea of science meeting self help but sadly what started as a potentially good idea was massacred in Heying and Weinstein's hands. They come across as insufferable know-it-alls and if only we listened to them life would be perfect! The science appears sketchy at best (many of the studies they reference have either been discredited or are such small scale that their validity is yet to be proven long term) and yet they act as though they are preaching gospel truth. In fact the whole book comes across as preachy with a list of tips at the end of each chapter ranging from the mundane (get more sleep, eat less processed food etc) to the questionable (always view the body of your deceased relatives) to the potentially dangerous (water fluoridation is toxic to children). I found some of their views especially on medicine, gender and relationships to be stereotypical, polarising, and at times verging on offensive. And yet the authors preach these points as gospel fact, peppered with supposedly inciteful (usually boastful) anecdotes about their own perfect lives and families. The central metaphor of the book is based on Chesterton's fence (make sure you understand the purpose of something before you destroy it) and is an interesting one in terms of evolutionary biology and I would be interested to read another book that tackles the concept less ineptly and written by a less insufferable author.In addition, I listened to this book on Audible (read by the authors) and there were two additional issues with the narration. Firstly, despite reading aloud their own work they continued to refer to themselves in the third person which is frankly weird and not something I've come across before in any other audio book read by the author. Secondly, they pronounce the word niche as ""nitch"" and the frequency of which they use and mispronounce this word left me close on many occasions to hurling my phone across the room!Avoid!!"

The premise is one I resonate with deeply - living in the modern world feels a bit like trying to run Doom Eternal on Windows 95. But this book does not succeed in grounding its modern-day toolkit in actual science. Instead, we have a book with two only thinly connected identities. The first is a somewhat interesting survey of evolutionary biology through varied contemporary lenses. The second is essentially just a bunch of unwarranted culture war hot takes, delivered with unflappable certainty.Let's take the ""Corrective Lens"" from their chapter on Sex & Gender as an instructive example. The chapter begins by delving into fairly straight-forward stuff on sexual dimorphism and their behavioral correlates, sex expression (i.e. gender) and cases of switching sex in the wild, and so on. But then, during the Corrective Lens, the authors somehow feel warranted in slinging out a ""Any child saying they're trans is almost certainly wrong, and probably only think so because of gender ideology or endocrine disruptors in the environment"". WOAH! This is basically the first mention of trans humans in the whole chapter, never mind ""gender ideology"" or ""endocrine disruptors""! How about introducing these ideas a bit first, before slinging out the easily-regurgitated soundbyte? How about introducing some (any!) science or history on trans people or intersex people, instead of merely acknowledging they exist ""albeit rarely""? How about any engagement with (still nascent!) research on the stickiness of trans identity from early youth? How about any serious consideration of the plights of people trying to navigate their identity themselves, with their own child, or healthcare provider, or state legislature? As usual, the only solution offered is via Chesterton's Fence, e.g. full-on Cave of Wonders ""TOUCH NOTHING"" vibes.Read ""Behave"" by Robert Sapolsky instead - fair-handed, more rigorous, and his conclusions (among them a blanket denial of free will + advocating a fairly radical restructuring of our existing criminal justice system) feel completely merited by the serious heft of their preceding pages, regardless of whether you agree with them.Two stars. Some of the simpler recommendations around sleep were solid, and I learned some interesting facts about the appendix."

170,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15837525-cyndee,Rating 3 out of 5,"The title of this book intrigued me because I think it's fairly obvious that modern capitalist/consumerist society is not good at meeting the psychosocial needs of human beings and this had led to a whole host of problems. But I feel like in the end that particular point isn't really addressed very well and the book tries to cover too many topics at once. The authors are evolutionary biologists who primarily study animals. They have no expertise in anthropology, sociology, or psychology, yet are making suppositions in these areas based on their personal opinions. The first couple chapters, which talk about evolutionary biology, are science-based and quite interesting. Afterwards, each chapter has a theme, such as food, sex, childrearing, school, etc, supposedly from an evolutionary perspective. At the end are tips on how to correct the modern way of doing things, which makes the book have a self-help feel that I don't really like. Many of their recommendations are fairly mainstream and should be familiar to most of the audience - i.e. don't eat processed foods, keep away from blue lights at night. I enjoy the authors' anecdotes about their lives as scientists studying in rainforests in Madagascar, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. Not always relevant, but interesting. However, it's clear that they have biases. In particular, they are vehemently against casual sex and pro-monogamy, supposedly because this is the only way to get a man to aid in taking care of his children. The authors believe that culture is an adaptation and longstanding cultural norms, such as women being sex gatekeepers, are good because that's what allowed humans to survive until this point, and sexual liberation is bad. The authors also hold some strange views on modern medicine such as casting broken bones is bad unless they are major breaks, and most medications are bad. The last chapter concerns sustainability and I found it particularly intriguing because the authors have a reputation for being right wing, but this chapter, while never mentioning capitalism, is quite critical of a system utterly dependent on constant growth and waste. They advocate for a sustainable, steady-state system despite the fact that we are (supposedly) evolutionarily primed for constant growth. I feel like this was valuable but unfortunately it seems impossible to achieve in the current climate. "
171,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This was a challenging read for me. Not in terms of the content, directly, as it was pretty straightforward and organized, but more in terms of the minor existential crisis it raised in me. Long story short, how much time should one invest in reading literature written by authors that share a different world view than you? I imagine the answer is different for everyone and can be impacted by life circumstances, but it's something I've wondered about at various points across the years with no real resolution. I was on for the ride with this book right from the start, digging in and really finding myself invigorated. At a point, however, about midway through, some statements were made that caused me to pause. Pause enough to spend some time researching the authors, viewing their podcast, checking out other reviews, you know, the normal stuff. I won't get into the nitty gritty of it all, but suffice it to say, there were some things that made me question the value of the content I was reading. And in this very, VERY, busy season of my life, I wondered if I had the leisure to devote time to something that wasn't directly informing me in the most easy, straightforward way. Well. I stuck with it, and I'm so glad I did. While I disagree with some of their points (particularly the correctives they offer at the end of each chapter...some were great, some were odd...some were unbelievably impractical bordering on out of touch) for the most part, I really, truly appreciated this book. I have been exploring the various aspects of how tech, digital communication, social networking, and capitalism in our neoliberalist world just bares down on everything in our daily lives...this book spoke to that in a way I had not encountered before. The physical, biological, and evolutionary components are such a critical part of the equation, it helped round out other areas I've been exploring and really taught me a lot about things I don't typically spend a lot of time thinking about. I would recommend it, and found that for all my hemming and hawing, the perspectives offered by the book were neither as extreme nor as different from my own, than I had originally thought. "

173,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"This book had the potential to be great, and instead they uphold science the wrong way round; they start with a theory and looks for evidence to support it without first trying to disprove themselves. This leads them to opinions, sometimes ones I even agree with, but can still see that they came to this conclusion from a shoddily supported angle.For example, I do agree that medicine should be practiced more holistically and with less unnecessary surgery, but to base that opinion on an anecdote of a single person who came out fine when he didn't have a cast on his broken arm instead of using mounts of data to support that argument is just plain silly. (I am being blunt here, they mostly did very little work to disprove their claims, which is a basic scientific principle to make sure that, even if you aren't exactly right, at least you are not wrong. They are often wrong.)They also compare the perceived increase in people experimenting with their gender expression to frogs that change sex characteristics upon contact to bizarre chemicals, before ever thinking that maybe people can experiment with their gender expression because it's safer since we don't have a capital punishment on being queer nowadays, as opposed to earlier days and other cultures. The idea that visibility might be increased because of fast media also never occurs to the authors.Read with caution, keep an eye out for unsubstantiated claims, anecdotes and single solutions to large complex problems with various causes, because this book is written in a lot of ""it looks like this, so therefor it must be caused by exactly this"" in scientific language. Don't be fooled, things are rarely ever that simple.Credit where credit is due, at times the writers themselves acknowledge this failing themselves, it just doesn't seem like they thought potentially being wrong was important enough to stop publishing medical advice that might change someone's attitude towards their health and safety for better or worse..."

I do think there is something to be gained from understanding ourselves as animals adapted to a lifestyle completely different from the one we live today. But it is very easy to fall into a trap of arguing that thing X that you don’t like didn’t exist when we evolved tens of thousands of years ago and therefore we should abandon it in favour of… I don’t know what. The authors argue that we are the most adaptable species, essentially, ever. And yet repeatedly, it seems to me, go on to argue that various aspects of modern life our outside our ability to adapt to. Like sitting at a desk. Or eating GMO foods. Or… using vaccines, I imagine, though they don’t argue that here, at least in the parts I read.What they do argue for is the “precautionary principle,” which seems to be, essentially, since life/the world/our bodies/society is a complex system that we can’t really understand, and we could accidentally cause major unforeseen harm through changes we introduce, therefore we should, like, probably never change anything? I guess? It reminds me of John Rawls’s veil of ignorance in that he concludes we must adopt a “maximin” principle of pursuing a world in which the worst possible outcome is as good as possible. The precautionary principle likewise says it is rational to the least amount of potential harm caused by technological change as possible. I don’t agree, that doesn’t seem rational to me at all. And so for me the book falls into the same kind of anti-progress camp as Taleb’s Black Swan. I can see the appeal. But that way lies failure, ultimately, doesn’t it? Like so many empires that turned their backs on the outside world, outlawed new technologies, and atrophied while the world passed them by. Read Where Is My Flying Car instead and contemplate all that has been lost to our generation by 50 to 70 years of being overly cautious. "
175,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This style of book usually will garner a high review for me in general. Our current world causes so much confusion with unnatural institutions and I think this is a really good nuanced argument on how to navigate it practically. Some will say to never use your phone and live in the woods, others turn to some fad diet, but this book backs up its claim with pretty good science and loads of evidence. Anytime an author (or authors here) try to take a comprehensive view on human behavior, they are going to miss out on a few details and be overly generalist. I don't want to say that I know more than these academics who study these issues for a living, I think they are acutely aware of the topics they had to cut short due to brevity. Though for topics I did know more about, I found myself wanting the nuance and realizing that other topics probably deserve that too. Their book's strengths lie in the description of early human behavior and other anthropology. Something I'll take with me is the idea that any early behavior that has an energy detriment is evolutionarily conserved for reason. Also, that humans niche is niche switching. These large trends I found extremely insightful and a new way to look at a topic I already like so much. They lose me a bit when they try to give high level opinions on things such as sex, religion, and schooling. It feels as though they are only thinking in their anthropology professor lens and not recognizing some of the real constraints current culture has that lent itself to these institutions. In fact I feel their own maxim of why some of these energy taxing institutions remain should be applied. But overall my criticisms are minor. I love the theme of this book and I think many others would benefit from reading it. It's a great overview into early and modern human behavior and I will think about its lessons as I go through my day to day life. Cannot ask too much more for a book. "

I'm not a scientist, but a lifelong learner, reader, and observer, so I was excited to dive deeply into this tome. I was, sadly, so disappointed. The first few chapters touch on evolution and epigenetics, which I found interesting and promising as an introduction to build upon the ""challenges of modern life"". After chapter 3, and through about chapter 11, the author's attempted to address the areas where they see a conflict between our human evolution and the accelerated novelties that humans are constantly exposed to in our modern environment. While I didn't disagree with many of their observations or opinions, they fall short of providing scientific arguments to support their suggestions. Their tone becomes increasingly ""preachy"". Furthermore, they give relationship advice and parenting advice based on little more than having their own relationship and being parents. They have no credentials for much of the ""advice"" they offer.I had expected the authors to address things like how our brains evolved vs. what our massive amount of screen time is doing to our children's brains; or how the 24-hour news cycle is overwhelming our body's ""fight or flight"" mechanisms. It would've been appropriate to address our consumerism and a scarcity mentality work in our culture vs. our evolutionary culture. Instead, the reader gets pithy advice such as ""let your children co-sleep"", ""breastfeed your children"", ""avoid dating apps"", ""consider engaging in psychedelic drugs"" and ""sit around campfires"". At times, I felt like they authors were making veiled political statements as well. They weren't brave enough to actually state their political position, but rather use suggestive innuendo to make their point. Overall, I was left feeling like this wasn't the book I THOUGHT I'd purchased, and I consider the authors wasted their opportunity to take on an interesting and relevant topic."

Sociology/Biology is a very subjective topic, without as much empirical or objective data as other scientific fields - it's a subject where proficiency is gained from conglomerating a variety of topics which all have bits of applicability and coming out with your own viewpoint on things. With the authors being very educated in more senses of the word than most, their analysis of things like the evolution of the brain, human lineage, the development of sexuality, culture vs genes vs consciousness were all great subjects. However, a holier than thou attitude shines through as some arguments are taken too far without any evidence besides an opinion. Medicine is bad, school is bad, technology is bad, non-monogamy is bad - etc etc with loose and trite examples given on each subject.I didn't want this bias to prevent me from learning quite a bit from this reading though, and it absolutely gives the reader much food for thought in a very timely period of human history and change. I'd never read about the development and evolution of love before, or about consciousness developing as the authors posit. The last notes in the book regarding politics, the division the world is seeing today, and muses of COVID pandemic were also refreshing.Liberty is emergent - therefore not a single value. It is an emergent consequence of having fixed the other problems (e.g., justice, security, innovation, stability, community).A slightly better draft or editing out biases throughout would have made this a 5 star book.

Instead, the authors take on a preachy and condescending tone and use cherry picked pieces of information to bolster views they both already have. It's clear after reading this book that the authors are technophobic, distrusting of authority, and probably left leaning libertarians. This should not come out so readily in a book that is supposed to be non-fiction pop-science. These views come out especially strong in sections where the authors talk about children and school. Here's a quote to get a flavor of the tone. This comes at the end of a section in the chapter about school.""Congratulations, society. you have successfully produced self-satisfied whiners who are accustomed to getting what they want, who are good at school but not at thinking, and who are, in fact, neither smart nor wise."" Another quote in the book stood out to me. ""All people are inclined to be verificationists, to look for verifying evidence of their own correctness, rather than to look for falsifying evidence."" The authors seems to think they are the exception to this, but they have done just this with the book. There are so many different ways to look at things presented in this book, but they chose to take an evolutionary lens and only keep the things they see through it that already fit their worldview. It was frustrating to read in that regard.Still giving it 3 stars because it was well written, I liked the concept of the book, and I did learn some things from the authors worldview. "

Their misunderstanding of the medical field is of the kind you often see in basic scientists who fall into the Dunning Kruger trap where they believe that because they know about their own field, somehow they don't need years of a medical education and experience to confidently spout opinions without backing them up.Speaking of medical misinformation, I just found out that these authors are proponents of the lab-leak theory of covid and they are true believers in the magical powers of ivermectin. Credibility meter just went wayyy down.I finally decided to throw in the towel in the most transphobic of chapters where Heying drones on about how the animal kingdom has division of labor and clear sex roles, therefore we need to stick to that model as human animals because that's the way things should be and we shouldn't delude ourselves that gender is a spectrum like those silly liberals think. Going against well-studied modern medical research-- that she hasn't taken the time to read-- on the benefits of hormone treatment for transgender people and delaying puberty for trans kids, Heying essentially says we are committing a crime against nature with these treatments. And that there's really something biological to the fact that women aren't good at math. Oh also she says sex positivity is evil.How did this get published? "

The argument about social networks alone is enough to convince anyone that Heying has a point. What is the effect of too much information? Didn't Denzel Washington say that in an interview? It's a good question. Heying does not deign to answer, merely to describe the sociological challenge. I was curious about Heying's description of a campfire, that it was an important invention of social civiliation. It provided an environment for conversation and dialogue. In Jordon Peterson's 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, he invoked the story of the lobster as an example of how biological hierarchies are. He caused me to question the ""inevitability"", for lack of a better word, other human things are. I am a typically quiet person and have often said I probably wouldn't be too upset if I lost hearing - but perhaps I am just being naive. The ability to converse is very important. The ability to talk and be heard is a way of thinking....something Peterson states in Beyond Order: 12 More Rules For Life. This isn't meant to be an advertisement for Dr. Peterson, only that Heying's position that the campfire and the institution of the conversation is an important part of our inherent psychological/sociological health. The necessity for us be with one another is a real thing. It's not debatable, only ironic, that technology has driven people apart. And if that is so, what is the effect? It's a curious one and maybe a question we should be more wary of. Heying discusses many other topics, but the general idea is the same. This was an interesting introduction to this topic. I could have gone without the summary of our evolutionary development.In pure coincidence, I listened to this while reading The Terminal Man, which was a science-fiction medical thriller from 1972 which was also a warning of the impact of technology."

It's a shelf for all of the books I read to chapters of just to realize it is written from a place of intense privilege.When I come across books like this, I usually have two thoughts: 1. how do they deal with disability and mental illness and 2. How do they deal with non-heterosexuality and the difference between sex and gender?Because if you think the correct solution for the neurochemical imbalances that cause my crippling depression and anxiety are curable with a bit of good sleep then frankly I want.to punch you in the face. It is a valid argument that people can be overmedicated and that medication is not the mental health perfect cure. Counseling, for example, and a good support system are important.

They try to explain the evolution of humans through the evolution of other animals all just to push their opinions and agenda. Definitely transphobic, definitely misogynistic, and ableist. At one point they bring in watching porn as a deterrent to evolution and call porn watchers “sexually autistic.” And then say that they are trying to offend people with autism because they’re capable of love. So they literally wanted to use the word “retarded” but knew that would be taboo. There weren’t any homophobic comments which shocked me but it was underlying. I’m so sick of ideology that women are the weaker species and this book is counterintuitive L. They claim humans evolve and behavior determines all except for when it comes to sex. They also say that people dispute that there are only two sexes…. No, that’s accepted. Gender on the other hand is fluid, which they also admit. Anyway these are the same people who pushed Ivermectin to cure Covid, so you get an good anti-vax vibe right from the start of the book. Their sleeve with the author description explains that they were once college professors but quit because their school had equity initiatives that they interpret as segregation, so they’re clearly stunted intellectually. Lastly, they kept bringing up fiction and Jesus parables that had no connection to anything.So I stopped reading at the Gender chapter because it was too much that they were telling me to stop watching porn. So I skipped to the culture chapter and put it down and will never read the rest of this malarkey."

Heying and Weinstein, married evolutionary biologists, discuss a vast range of topics confronting modern humans with an evolutionary lens, tagging everything from food to technology to religion on the scale of adaptive response. The general point is: we’ve existed as biological creatures way longer than our modern, post-industrial lifestyle has existed, so our instincts are often either counterproductive (binging calorie-rich food is not advisable in a world of readily available calories) or ignored, to our detriment (artificial lights disrupt natural sleep cycles and thereby human health, mood, and productivity).There were several chapters however, that this evolutionary perspective led the authors to proscribe practices as “best” that don’t necessarily align to what might actually be “best” for an individual. These included discussions of sex (both act and identity) and gender, religion, and medicine. Their conclusions here seem to dismiss the complexity of these practices in the modern world, despite an stated emphasis on not ignoring system complexity that runs throughout the text. These stances can provoke excellent discussions, but should be taken as prescriptivist advice to live your life. I do recommend reading to understand this view better.Final note: the authors, particularly Heying, should not have narrated the audiobook. Their soft, sleepy tones made it difficult to pay attention."

For the good points, the authors really broke down how sociologically fucked our world is. I pulled out tons of great ideas, such as the illusion created by measuring a proxy (ie ""carbs"" instead of nutrition or ""test scores"" instead of learning) is comforting but ultimately misguided, or that systems level thinking is often complex and full of unintended consequences. I also generally agree with many of the points, that technology can be detrimental to our brains if not reigned in, that too many unnatural elements has few unintended consequences. That being said, though, I found the authors to be the most insufferable, smuggest assholes who ever wrote a book. They're just so much fucking better than all us unenlightened scum and every word of that book was dripping with their disdain for people who don't want to shit in the woods with them or raise our children in the overly precise way they did. I also had a lot of problems with their obvious contempt for trans people, to the point that they snuck in disparaging phrases about them in chapters that weren't even about sex. At the end, I agree that we need to regulate a world focused on sustainability and not growth, but I hated having anything in common with those people."

Also the author seem an expert on mammal glands (feed baby) yet he was unable to ask himself why humans the only species to literally suck from a different mother do what they do? Oh, someone of his family was lactose intolerant…maybe that’s why there wasn’t much said about it in his guide. He also talks about the things in nature that wants to be eaten and the ones that it doesn’t such as plants, seeds and milk. MILK? REALLY? Didn’t he just said that mammal gland is the provided of the food for babies? Oh my “The second misguided assumption that many such diets reveals is that they seems to presume that food is merely for survival. The evolutionary truth is that food is for more than just survival…we eat to acquire the energy and nutrients necessary to be alive.” I guess being American you have the right to say that you eat for pleasure but of course paying a high price (healthwise). “In spite of its stodgy reputation, monogamy is the best mating system. It creates more competent adults, reduces the tendency to engage in violence and warfare and fosters cooperative impulses” - where did he get this idea from? So in short I was way more disappointed to the fact that there was absolutely nothing about animal farming and how destructive it is to the planet…it might be because our ancestors never even imagined we’d get there so they wouldn’t dare to say - he y’all go vegan!

Specifically, it covers numerous topics but fails to ""dig in"" to any one of them in a meaningful way. I also found a lot of the book leaned more on personal opinion (or unsubstantiated correlation-based points) than actual evolutionary science. Overall, the epigenetic link between modern culture (the 21st century lifestyle) and genetics/biology (which is what this book is supposed to be about) didn't feel presented to me in any meaningful way. I also cannot see how reading this book will ""outline a science-based worldview that will empower you to live a better, wiser life.""There's almost no take-aways in the book, though if you read it looking for guidance you can come back with two hidden messages: everyone is an addict and phones/social media are harmful, put them down. Processed food and snacking is also a problem, see.To be fair, I did ""learn a few things"" and found some of their opinions/insights interesting and worth thinking over. OVERALL though, I kept thinking I'd stumbled into a lecture by a new adjunct college professor or TA who lost their lesson plan and/or presentation before class and was trying to wing it.Lastly, the narration was particularly poor.

I knew nothing of the authors who are evolutionary biologists before picking it up. I hoped it would be a biologically-based explanation of how the biology of modern humans which has not changed much since our earliest human ancestors struggles to cope with a physical world that has changed drastically. And it does, in part, do that but with a strong ideological overlay that makes it vulnerable to being weaponized by ultra-conservatives. At the beginning, the authors’ use of what they call “Chesterton’s fence” - the maxim that one shouldn’t take down a fence (I.e. practice, system, protocol) until you know what problem it was built to solve - seemed like common sense, but morphs over the course of the work to be flung as a diatribe against post-modernism, “teaching the test”, gender identity, and blue-light emitting devices. However, they assert, the careful use of psychedelic substances might be useful. (Huh? What?) By the time I finished I couldn’t make heads or tails of their argument except, to quote a folksy saying, “they were agin it” whatever “it” might be. I find it worth reading more for the issues raised than for their proposed responses to them. And I learned a new word: kludge. "
189,no user info,No Rating,"I'm not giving a star rating. Stars are for ""is this good or bad?"" and this book is too nuanced to get so reductive in it's evaluation. Good or bad depends entirely on who you are, what you believe, and what you're looking for.The Guide is well-written. There are some big ideas in the book, but communicated in an accessible format. This applies to both the prose/entertainment aspect, and the structure of the arguments. I think it's relatively easy to pick up what Heying and Weinstein are laying down. Whether or not their methods are sound and their conclusions valid, I don't think it's possible to objectively claim. There are some things here that you might not like, because they propose a lifestyle that is challenging, and counter-cultural. There are things you may love, because they validate your suspicions. If you're looking for a sense of what those conclusions are, I would say they are conservative, in the truest sense of the word. Heying and Weinstein do not automatically claim old is good. They are very firm that we need to understand what we're messing with before we get cute with it, and that applies to food, medicine, education, sex and gender, family, even superstition itself.Despite lack of stars, I think this book is worth reading. Agree with them or not, the ideas are worth contending with."

Actually, I think I know exactly what to think about it, but have no clue what to do about it.Just like Peterson's lecture centered on Tao and the border between order and chaos in his book 12 Rules for Life, Heying and Weinstein walk the line throughout this book, and adhering to the advice provided within its own pages, there were plenty of ideas that I thought were insightful and several thay I found to be a bit of stretch and could probably be tossed aside. Ultimately this book, too, like 12 Rules, is an argument for a cultural shift to be shouldered by the individual and spread via example to others - something I admire.While I've come to align with the metaphorical perspective provided in Peterson's book more than the literal perspective provided in Hunter-Gatherer, I do think a lot of interesting insights are provided to chew on. It's also a much easier book to read than the former. I do think this book will get a lot more undue hate than its deserves (purely because of who the people are that wrote it, and some of their unconventional thoughts) so for that, I rate Hunter-Gatherer the same four stars."
191,no user info,Rating 1 out of 5,"I picked this up because I love the subject matter. I was really intrigued by other books ostensibly on the same topics, like Sapiens, and Brief History of Humanity.This one started out OK. The authors talked about how culture evolves just like DNA and the two are connected in ways not always obvious. Cool, I'm on board. Then I noticed the tone changing. It got more and more political. It also started making claims that were not supported by the studies and evidence they included. It went further and further, and by the middle of the book it was moralizing and claiming young women cannot find happiness in promiscuity.I'm not an expert, I don't claim to know the science. But I do know these two got out well ahead of their evidence and turned this book into a kind of political manifesto. I took a closer look at the back cover and, surprise, surprise, there's a glowing recommendation from incel icon Jordan Peterson. The authors bio on the back also plays up how the resigned in indignation from their university because of politics. If you have one paragraph to convey your expertise for a potential reader, and you have to include a political fight, the book is either explicitly about politics or it's trying to be sneaky. This book is very much the latter."

Like with sun exposure, they write that sun exposure is good for us humans and that people who avoid the sun have a higher mortality rate. But how much is good and how much is excessive? Do they recommend sunblock at all or just avoiding the sun during peak hours? Then at the end of that same chapter on medicine, they briefly mention ""mismatch diseases,"" with examples being diabetes, atherosclerosis and gout. This sparked my interest but then nothing else was written about it, leaving me wondering about this topic. There was so much they could have written about food, but bizarrely wrote about our ancestors using fire to cook food and the benefits that came out of it. Yeah, we already knew that. I am more interested in current relationship between diet and health. I want to know how the modern diet is helping or hurting us, and the connection between the average diet and growing intolerance for gluten, leaky gut syndrome, autoimmune diseases, and the microbiome, and how this relates to our ancestors. Overall, I like their perspective and especially their anti-helicopter parenting stance."
193,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"To understand the origin of this book, it is helpful to be aware of the conversation between Bret Weinstein and Richard Dawkins that took place in Chicago on the 23rd of October of 2018:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYzU-...What you find in this talk is a very eloquent Bret being contradicted by Dawkins at every turn. Bret displays his skepticism towards mathematical models, much to Dawkins surprise, and goes on to touch on several topics that are abridged on in the book. For example: lineage, senescence and culture.Absent of mathematics, much of what Bret and Heather state in the book are philosophical musings at best, and pseudoscience at worst. Particularly, I do not understand the logic behind the concept of lineage. Just because we share some evolutionary history with all the living beings on Earth, why should we share the same behavior? Nonetheless, I find myself agreeing with Bret and Heather at several points in the book. For example, it seems incumbent upon Dawkins to explain why culture would have its own hereditary units - the famous memes - rather than existing to serve the genes, being as they are a product of ""gene survival machines"", us humans.

I wasn't aware of the authors' backgrounds before starting the book, but I can see how they fit into the 'intellectual dark web' culture, even though it is toned down a bit in the book. The book is quite meandering, but basically argues that many of the psychological and social problems that people in western countries experience (the authors use an acronym to describe these people - 'WEIRD' people - it's a bit bizarre) are due to the fact that we're not living in the way human beings evolved to live. Whilst I don't think this is an entirely bad argument, the book often presents this in moral terms, at times indicating that we're to blame for having these difficulties because we aren't living in the way that we should be (which, as is suggested by various anecdotes, seems to be the way that the authors choose and are able to live their lives). Overall, a good premise for a book, but lacks the kindness and academic nuance that I think is needed in exploring some of the possible causes of modern life's many difficulties through an evolutionary lens."

Their interview absolutely fascinated me me so much about how humans were not designed for an unregulated social media world such as todays. It not only led me to buy this book but to delete my social media apps from my phone. This book is very meaty as the road of evolutionary biology is laid out in terminology that would perhaps require another read to fully appreciate to the untrained novice. The research methodology and use of first principles inspired me to adopt a similar principle of research and hypothesis in my own work. While I am thoroughly intrigued by the research, I would have appreciated much more real world examples from today to understand the correlations more.As a listener of the audiobook, I also do feel that both Heying and Weinstein should have bypassed reading the text as their monotone and reasonable voices beg for stimulation and energy to highlight the research with more passion.I look forward to reading this again to ask more poignant questions of the human race in the hopes of greater accountability instead of blame!

196,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77027712-augustin-grigorov,Rating 4 out of 5,"I agree with the main premise of this book - we are redefining what it means to be human at a rapid pace, and that poses risks because we're changing systems we don't fully understand and that can lead to unintended consequences. Therefore we need to be on the lookout for reductionist thinking and combat it. What I don't like is that the authors want to present the content of the book as ""scientific"" and they often draw and present conclusions based on a sample of one (their son). That's if they bother to back their claims at all. There were several chapters, the one about how to raise children for example, or the one about how to teach, where they frequently present opinions without backing them up. This poses a problem because the reader doesn't know which part of the book is based on rigorous science with controlled studies and proven results, and which is just hypothesis the authors came up with. It does however contain some very interesting food for thought. Often books tell you what you already know or intuitively understand or agree with. This one, at least for me, made me question things. With some pretty strong caveats I think it's worth a read."

What is with authors these days - repeating themselves a dozen different ways. I can't stand books that feel like they were written by fulfilling a daily word quota. Maybe this would be an interesting book after many rounds of editing. Wouldn't hurt to cut back on the self-absorption and assumptive arguments/declarations. One thing I found especially bothersome was that they claimed the !Kung of the Kalahari were currently still living as hunter gatherers and left it at that - not a word more about how their traditional ways of living have been eroded at for the past 70+ years, and very few if any maintain their 'old way' (in the words of Elizabeth Marshall Thomas). You would think there would be some extensive discussion about the !Kung or other near-past cultures of hunter gathering societies given the literal title of the book. To me, this is an extension of their podcast - drawn out, redundant, with glimmers of interesting points - just enough to consider listening to/reading in full.... but nearly regretting the loss of your wasted time toward the end.

198,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43439227-christine,Rating 3 out of 5,"I found this book to be incredibly educational and thought provoking as the authors introduce a variety of theories related to evolution and the chapters are filled with examples, many of which are about animals, many others are about people. The balance among these three things was helpful in understanding the arguments put into this book and the modern application of some of the caution. It was on the road to being a 5 star book. Then somewhere in chapter 9 and definitely in the remaining chapters the voice of the book completely changed. It is obvious that someone else has started writing and the theories put forth, the examples connecting evolution, our past, and the animal world almost disappear from the book, and we start to hear the opinions of the author instead. This is especially true in the chapter on school. It felt as though I put down the book I was really enjoying and started reading an opinion piece that wasn't nearly as helpful if captivating. I hoped it was a quick detour but this change of voice remained for the final chapters and ultimately knocked the entire book down to 3 stars - it was okay, average, fine."

On a personal note, I found their information and help invaluable and they helped inform a lot of my own decision making. Among other things, they were some of the first people to say this was likely a leak from a lab, though they suffered socially and financially by stating so before it was accepted by the mainstream.On this book in particular, I found much of it interesting but the overall narrative didn't mesh as well as I hoped. At the end, I felt like I had learned some really interesting bits, but the overall principles that they wrapped up with didn't quite tie the bow on everything in my opinion. As a Christian, I found the most interesting parts of this book were when the science lined up with received wisdom. They did a good job of explaining this, but their advice on monogamy, raising children, how to be an adult, sex and gender, and why we shouldn't strive to live forever was fascinating. Recommended."

I appreciate the transparency and coherency of the intellectual framework Heying and Weinstein present, bringing their shared lens of evolutionary biology to bear on making meaning of the world we live in today. The anchoring principles for their meaning making are their ""Omega Principle"" and (G.K.) Chesterton's Fence (either of which would have served as a more accurate primary title, followed by the subtitle of An Evolutionary Biology Perspective on the Challenges of Modern Life but that undoubtedly wouldn't have been as catchy). Having no more than a rudimentary background in evolutionary biology myself, I am curious about the reception of the Omega Principle by other evolutionary biologists. In fact, the main thing missing in the book for me was alternative points of view. Still, I feel I have a better understanding of the basis from which the hosts of the Dark Horse podcast make sense of the today's issues. And that's valuable information."

What I don't like is the incredible speed by which they zoom in and out of specific experiments and grandiose statements of what society *ought* to be. The heavy-handedness of the opinions seem to dilute an otherwise-interesting compilation of biological and sociological facts.

I even agree with a good percentage of the opinions set in this book, but there's a whole lot of simplification to argue against, and even if I agreed with all of it, there's never been a ""this is what's wrong with society nowadays"" conversation I've wanted to be a part of. I got a fair bit out of it. But their sources are severely lacking and/or incredibly questionable. And for a book with whole sections warning against reductionism, that's really all most of it amounts to.

But the book gets more and more interesting and informative as you progress through it. Heather and Brett are both well-educated people who spent their careers teaching others how to think rather than what to think. That would seem an obvious but as they point out, certain political movements across society have dumbed down and radicalized the student population. Worryingly, it has also made it more difficult for students to mature into well-adjusted adults by exposing them to conflict and opposing ideas. They argue why humans are anti fragile from an evolutionary and biological perspective and why it is so important to cultivate this quality.The book covers fascinating advice for parents on how best to raise home tally healthy children, and how to behave like our ancient ancestors in matters of survival, health, sleep, and creativity.

Unless they were only included to show that the authors actually have some understanding of science? Nor did the book deliver what the title promises beyond trite recommendations. Unfortunately I listened to the audiobook. Someone should have told the authors to hire a professional reader. The two authors swap off reading between chapters. Heying has a raspy quiet mumble and Weinstein is much louder. Awful. Painful. Annoying. Later I found out they have a podcast, ohhh they like to hear themselves talk. Now it makes sense. The podcast is truly painful to listen to because of their voices. And then I learned about the gross controversies surrounding this couple. I should have skipped this one.

I respect their thinking processes and that they expose this to all of us regularly for insightful analysis. This book is somewhat of a glimpse into what they tend to do in the podcast, choose relevant subjects and dissect them from an evolutionary perspective, which I personally really enjoy. Having listened to the podcast for several years, some of what is in the book was redundant to me, but if one is not familiar with their work and their careful inspection of current western issues, it would be a good primer. And then become a listener. They have a great ability to communicate complex system issues clearly, with humor and respect for each other, even if they may disagree.

I'm particularly interested in their ideas on the evolutionary basis for same-sex relationship and transgenderism but they barely skim it and say it's a topic for another time.

This fundamental misunderstanding has led to health problems and issues surrounding the normal development of children into adults. Actionable advice:Feel the earth beneath your feet.The modern world tells us we need a different pair of shoes for every occasion. But sometimes the best thing you can do is not wear any shoes at all, and go barefoot. That’s because evolution has equipped us with natural shoes – the calluses that develop on the soles of our feet over time. When you forgo shoes, your feet are also able to transmit a lot more information about the type of terrain you're standing on, so that you can move in the best way. "

It popped into my GoodReads feed, and I purchased immediately - I had always enjoyed Bret and Heather in podcast/YouTube interviews, so it was a no-brainer, and the excitement started to build.So that was a week ago. I started reading the other day, and finished it pretty quick, but it's not a good book.There's a few chapters that shine - and then the author's step outside the area of expertise and all the science goes to shit. Their political stance takes over, and the idea behind 'a toolbox for 21st century' is lost.The early chapters on evolutionary biology and their use of animal models to expand the conversation was spot on. The call to action in the final paragraphs also ticked the boxes for me.The rest of the book was off the rails, for the most part. A few moments here and there, but not enough."
210,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10035204-david,Rating 2 out of 5,"This is a weird book. Great topic and interesting premise, but it ranges from brilliantly insightful to dangerous horrid pseudoscience dressed up as fact-based intellectual discourse. It's hard to recommend at all (hence the demotion to 2 stars) because of how warped and malign their thinking is on several critical issues. But it is also thought provoking, and an interesting exercise in sussing out how they let their ideology corrupt the otherwise good points, so I refrained from withholding the second star.Overall, I would skip it and instead read The Naked Ape by Desmond Morris, The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins, Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari, and Enlightenment Now by Steven PinkerNote: I didn't know anything about these people before reading the book, but apparently they are Ivermectin-hawking Covid-conspiracists, which isn't too surprising considering their irrational opposition to things like fluoridated water and GMO food."
211,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"This book was effective in providing a new perspective of our modern society and informing the audience about our evolutionary history and the world around us. However I did think the authors were off balance with focusing too much on the scientific information surrounding our evolution rather than applying it to our day in age. At times it felt like I was reading details straight from a high school text book that have no significance to me. (For example the random information about animals and our species in comparison to them.) That being said, I did think the book was effective in opening my mind and informing me about our unnatural ways of living and how they could be potentially harmful. Additionally I appreciated the “corrective lens” sections after every chapter as they provided some beneficial suggestions and an effective summary. Lastly, this book was s pretty slow read for me as I wanted to fully digest all the information, which was pretty dense and scientific. "
212,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book has a very different perspective on modern life, and especially on many aspects that the authors call ""hyper-novel"", showing how technological progress can easily lead to arrogance and ignorance towards the deeply encoded evolutionary history of the human race. The proposition that culture, as well as biology, can be adaptive from an evolutionary perspective was interesting and something I had not previously considered. The authors however use that proposition to extend their message far beyond the field of evolutionary biology, into psychology, economics, and politics, subjects on which they are not experts, but clearly have strong preconceived ideas on. The preachy tone throughout most of the book was also not very helpful to getting the main messages across. Still giving it a high rating for giving a fresh perspective on modernity, and maybe even influencing future behaviours."
213,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"A nice book. It felt like its going through the same topics as Sapiens and 21 lessons for the 21st century, but I felt this book was more interesting. In the first three chapters it goes through a history of evolution, and sets out a way of thinking about modern society based on the authors' understanding of evolution. Well argued, it gives a strong defence of traditions over newer scientific solutions in modern society. I.e. traditional medicine over modern scientific medicine. After chapter 3, each chapter applies this way of thinking to different topics. The book would have gotten 5 stars from me if it were only the first three chapters and then the other chapters got summarised. Some chapters were interesting to me, others were not. I recommend not reading chapters you don't find interesting. A lot was said in regards to raising children... which I don't have to worry about right now."

I disagree with their evolution theories for humans, but most of their suggestions for 21st century living are practical. I particularly like the sections on medicine and food. It seems logical to me to eat a diet based on one's heritage rather than to follow some current food trend. The section on schools fascinated me. I agree that ""keeping kids in neat rows"" and medicating them to sit quietly is not the best solution. However, as I regularly teach 25 Kinder and 1st graders at a time without assistance, I would love to hear their suggestions on how to keep order when I don't have the option to take them outside.I liked how they used the Chesterton's Fence theory throughout the book- the idea to not break something down just because we don't understand why it was put up in the first place. I agree that our society moves at too quick a pace and that we should proceed with caution in a lot of areas."

Fine. The book begins fairly in their evolutionary lain with an overview of human evolution and a simple and generally agreeable argument for cultural evolution and the claim the human culture is a result of evolution. However, by the time you hit the center of the book it completely devolves into pseudoscientific ramblings which are deeply racist, homophobic, transphobic, and ableist. They attempt to use scientific jargon to front their opinions on the superiority of the gender binary, monogamy, and against modern medicine, modern schooling, and modern technology. I lost all possible respect after reading ""porn, we posit, produces what we call sexual autism"" (p.120). I don't want to go on. But I could not un-recommend this book enough.

In the 21st century the rate of change is faster than ever before, and humanbeings are trying to deal with “hypernovelty”2. As things are changing fast, we struggle to keep up and adapt our behaviors and systems to deal with it3. Changing our systems and rules can be dangerous because we may not understand the trade offs and benefitsImpressionsWhile reading it felt somewhat disappointing, but after finishing my review i discovered that there were quite a few amazing passages and learnings to take away. How I Discovered ItDark Horse PodcastWho Should Read It?Anyone worried that we are not correctly addressing the challenges of modern lifeHow the Book Changed Me- It made me extra skeptical of any progressive and revolutionary sounding idea- It made me more interested in antiquated traditions like religionMy Top 3 Quotes- Cultural beliefs are often literally false, but metaphorically true.- Orginial Chesterton’s fence quote: *There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”*- Wikipedia entry of Hygiene Hypothesis: In medicine, the **hygiene hypothesis** states that early childhood exposure to particular microorganisms (such as the [gut flora] and [helminth] protects against [allergic] diseases by contributing to the development of the [immune system]. In particular, a lack of exposure is thought to lead to defects in the establishment of [immune tolerance]. The time period for exposure begins *in utero* and ends at school age.Summary + NotesThe Hygiene HypothesisWe grow up in ever cleaner environments are not exposed to enough “good” bacteria to strengthen our immune systems. That is why we develop more allergies, autoimmune disorders etc. Chesterton’s FenceA tale of the precautionary principle. When a modern reformer sees a fence, without understanding the use of it, they will suggest to get rid of it. A more intelligent reformer will only agree to remove a fence after the use of it is understood, because they are aware of unintended consequences that may result from removing the fence.Raising kidsAlways make sure your child knows that you love them. Once a child feels secure and loved they will be more courageous to go out and explore the world, which is the best way to learn. Explain rules and be flexible to make them work for you and your child. Give children real tasks and responsibility early on - rather than busywork. Cultural BeliefsCan be literally false, but metaphorically true: Farmers in Guatemala belief that planting a harvest during full moon protects their crop and set them up for a successful season. Though the moon does not literally protect the crops, it is helpful to follow the belief because planting all crops at once can overwhelm crop predators since they cant eat everyone’s harvest at once. Following the belief makes farmers better off, even though it is not literally true that the moon protects them.ReligionReligious rituals and practices are expensive. The time could be used more effectively and many resources are “wasted” to upkeep a belief and religious culture. If it were just expensive, but not beneficial most religions would have been outcompeted by a group of atheists who did not waste time and resources to religious practice. The fact that religions have survived so long shows that they are evolutionary stronger and better for people. Before throwing out all traditions and benefits that may come from religion, we must beware of “Chesterton’s fence”.The Mayan success hypothesisMayans were so successful because rather than investing plentiful years into growing population and saving for rougher times, they invested all their richness into building pyramids and temples, making them bigger and better every year. That way they did not grow their population and could survive more difficult times - thanks to a form of population control.Unsustainable growthImagine we invent a fridge that uses less resources to built, but is better and lasts longer than any other fridge. Once it becomes well adopted this would have a negative impact on GDP, because people would need to buy less fridges. Some positive developments have a negative impact on our main measurement of success. We need to redefine success to get out of the cycle of never ending growth."

Lots of that too (don’t wear sunscreen, don’t see a dr if you break a bone)There’s no scientific evidence or citations but the authors make it clear that they give excellent advice and you should listen.

It was fun hearing them switch reading from chapter to chapter. I'm not sure if we're supposed to infer that the reader of each chapter was more of the SME for that chapter, or if they were more directly involved in shaping those chapters, or if they just read every other chapter to keep it even.The best parts of the book are them sharing stories about their research, teaching, and child rearing. From the sounds of it, they could write a thrilling travel log/ memoir.As many other reviewers have noted, the conclusions they draw about how contemporary society should work are not well reasoned, or particularly supported by the analysis of cultural and evolutionary forces they base it on."

I struggled to focus on the read when turning pages. Lost complete interest as I got deeper into it. I barely finished. I would not have completed the book if not for RT (Book Club Selection). Collected only one note card of notes. The authors book started with heightened interest. It had a coherent structure with each chapter ending with a corrective lens, only if you assumed something was wrong. The book possibly should have been named to hallucinating by the campfire practicing monogamy. The read was heavily footnoted and felt like a bunch term papers that were put together just before a deadline.I searched for the authors and listened to several interviews and podcasts about their life and book.

After really questioning what I read, I did some research of my own. I learned they “resigned” as professors from Evergreen State for promoting false claims about vaccines and ivermectin. It seems they think if you are a professor in evolutionary biology it gives you a deep understanding of parenting, psychology and critical race theories?!!I am deeply disappointed in this book.

Some of their “takeaways”—like 8 things to be a better human (last chapter)—were worth writing down. Those parts of the book deserve 4 stars. But, weirdly, there are also wild contradictions and interjections—like most trans kids will outgrow that phase—or the conspiracy theory about Covid stemming from a bio lab in Wuhan. Or, if we had all just become radially anti-social for 3-4 weeks, Covid would have gone away (even though earlier in the book they claim our sociability is both baked in and a key factor in why humans evolved. I think The Guardian pretty much nailed it with their review’s headline: “Self-help Laced with Pseudoscience.” It’s worth a read. Lastly, having the authors read it, particularly Mr. Weinstein, was a huge disservice to the book. "
222,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"There are some interesting facts used to illustrate points made by the authors, however the book seemed to be rooted in the biased lifestyle choices rather than the history of humanity. I would have liked to ventured more down the route of human development fromhunter gatherers to modern humans. Also, the diet section was particularly annoying and clearly opinionated. The chapter starts by slating the vegan wholefood diet claiming it may lead to deficiencies. However, the chapter concludes by stating wholefoods are a great way to get an array of nutrients. Any diet, if not nutritionally balanced, can lead to deficiencies. No need to single out a perfectly healthy lifestyle just because it isn’t the same as yours. Omnivores too, can suffer deficiencies due to a lack of understanding of nutrition."

As an aside, though, the authors seem to have a pretty narrow, one-track mind with regard to male and female evolution and natural inclinations. For example, they reject the idea of any social conditioning toward our ideas of masculinity and femininity, saying it's all 100% innate evolution and instinct. I find this totalism, black-and-white thinking hard to get on board with since most black-and-white thinking is inaccurate. More realistically, it's a mixture of both. Our ideas of masculinity and femininity are almost certainly in part the result of socialization, while some of it may also be innate and instinctual. Aside from the authors being too rigid and black-and-white in their thinking, though, there is some good, important stuff in this book for sure."

Every chapter I felt like the authors were on the cusp of making their point and then I’d get frustrated that they hadn’t.In essence, all I got from this book was that the authors didn’t take their child to the doctor after breaking his arm and made him go on five mile hike the next day and a couple weeks later the arm was perfectly healed after only using a splint for awhile.I have never taken so long to read a book and I have never not finished a book but this was not for me."

Picking fights with young liberals got them press, but they avoid responding to serious, academic critiques of their perspective. The best authors are the ones who are confident enough to avoid burning a strawman. The book is dominated by a misguided primitivism, a belief we can somehow wind back the clock, that the modern individual possesses the agency or capacity to “return to monke,” in a novel environment. Readers would be better served by other books that more fully address specific facets of evolutionary psychology, paleoanthropology, or evolutionary biology.

Many of the concepts and theories definitely need to be listened and understood more in society. The book itself is divided in chapters based on different aspects of society and life, there is however a contrast in quality of ideas varying between the chapters. The last part is also where the authors begin having more of a bias, even though their ideas are still worth reading in my opinion. There is a guarantee that valuable lessons and insights can be taken from this book, whether its about food, medicine or parenthood. It is an increasingly relevant and pressing problem for all of us to learn how to deal with modern society and its technology inn all areas of our life.

And there is a couple references to the Chesterton’s Fence principle, which I thought was a perfect visual of our modern predicaments. “Eh, so we don’t exactly know what this bodily organ does, so it’s cool if we just remove it right?” We answer “Yes” to so many of these types of questions as a society that it’s very troubling. And hence, the amount of toxins we’ve introduced in our environments, both literally in the physical environment and metaphorically in our social environment carry with them a cost that I’m not sure we’ll be able to pay.

Other than that, I thought the authors attempted to cover too much material, didn't go into much depth in any one area, and offered reasonably obvious solutions to sometimes oversimplified general problems. I preferred the earlier parts of the book with their insights as biologists, and didn't agree with some of their political views, or their rational, nearer the end of the book.

It almost moved down to a 3 because of the flaws, but the main theme was fascinating, and when it was good it was very very good. I especially enjoyed the opening and some nice concepts like Chesterton's fence.A minor flaw was that it is a little too deep on science when it was not necessary, but that was not too often. Worse was that too much of the discussion was not tied explicitly enough to the main objective of the book. Particularly bad were the chapters on raising children , which sounded more like simply their views on parenting, much of which I agreed with but were not what they were supposed to be saying. There were Corrective Lens recommendations at the end of each chapter that often sounded like something in a self-help book. Definitely worth a read but not as good as I had hoped."

Heying and Weinstein, despite living in the most prosperous age in the history of mankind, we also live in a time of political discord, high suicide rates, and loneliness. This is due to the accelerated rate of change in the modern world that has outstripped the capacity of our brains and bodies to adapt. Throughout this book the authors prescribe some advices about food, parenthood, schooling, etc. My favorite takeaways were the Chesterton’s Fence admonition (don’t remove something unless you can explain its purpose) and the recommendations about giving children room to explore, grow, and even risk injury - so long as the debilitation is not permanent (admittedly a fine needle to thread).

Some may find some of the material inconsistent with their beliefs or certainly the findings of others, but the authors provide strong support for the material presented. Notwithstanding the title, the book does not come across as self help. But for those interested in the self help genre like me, it can be received / actioned that way.

Nothing that perhaps you aren’t already aware of, e.g. eating processed food is bad for you, or that social media is changing society. There is a big difference between knowing a fact and feeling as though you should and can do something about it. The book has its value in making these things seem relevant to your daily life.The authors make an attempt to explain a lot of modern day life through an evolutionary lens and make a case for lineage selection. This is done in a very accessible manner which makes for easy reading, but lacks the depth of explanation required to truly argue the claim. I think its therefore important to accept this first before reading in order to avoid disappointment. "

Ironically I picked up this book at the library at the same time I got The Dawn of Everything, which similarly describes the dawn of humanity, but offers a more scholarly approach -- more footnotes, and more hedging, fewer definitive pronouncements. The current book is more like a Doctor Spock for a dysfunctional modern society.

That was even beyond a drunk old Chevy Chase telling to a small audience that Richard Pryor gave him absolution to use the n- word.

Civilization is a disease. It kills us before our time, diminishes the quality of the time we have, and it's literally killing off the biosphere that sustains all life.

While I am not much of a fan of arguments based solely on naturalistic evolutionary principles, I found it incredibly interesting that I agreed with so many of their conclusions. As a Christian, I have arrived at many of the same beliefs, although coming at them from a completely different path. So while I can quibble here and there with the authors' arguments, I believe the thrust of their message is correct: the world we have constructed for ourselves is actively harming us in ways most of us do not understand.

A couple of mental models are provided as over-arching themes of the book, but the meat of the book consists of examples taken from other species through several different categories of issues: gender, parenting, medicine, tradition, etc.All in all I found that it provides a new away of looking at certain current topics, while giving me a greater appreciation for the resilience of mankind as species."

I think that there were points that they were possibly overly pessimistic about the world, but equally I don't have enough of a time horizon to say whether I'm right or not. Equally, some of the prescriptions could have done more to allow for the realities of modern life. So there are many ideals, but for the majority of people living in suburbia or otherwise, some of the recommendations are unlikely to be possible.

Culture isn't just memes with a Life of Their Own (as I was taught) long ago.As such be aware of Chesterton’s fence. Chesterton’s Fence urges caution in making changes to systems that are not fully understood. In other words, if you don't know why something that people do exists, don't remove it!

I very much appreciated the first half of this book that outlines the evolutionary history of humans. It suggests ways we can tweak our sleeping, eating, and child-rearing patterns to be more resonant with our evolved biology and psychology. In contrast, the second half of this book was a little weak. The writers’ observations and suggestions grew more diffuse and seemed less directly connected to evolutionary history, making this feel more like a self-help book and less like a work of scholarship."

Brett even managed to fit his ""omg the SJWs came for me at Evergreen"" story into, which was honestly impressive. Authors are obviously entitled to their own viewpoints and personal experiences, but in my opinion the title/cover of the book make it seem like this is a fun unbiased science nerd read, but the contents just don't match with that."

I know it was written by a couple of professors that have spent their lives in academia. But I found this to be written more like something that would circulate in academic circles and not something that would ignite interest in the general populace. It was also (I found) riddled with opinions based on bias instead of suppositions based on scientific evidence. You know those meals where when you're done, you feel like you have to brush your teeth, floss, and use mouthwash to get the taste out. Well, I needed a similar process for my brain. "

What Heying and Weinstein have to say is often spot-on, and many of their recommendations (particularly those having to do with that invention of the Devil, social media!) are well worth following, but in suggesting that we simply accept a ""fourth frontier"" they ignore the fact that human beings are not going to stop breeding, and that the planet is finite. The only frontier that can possibly save us is Space--unless we get another pandemic that kills off at least 75% of us."

You can tell the authors are trying to combine and cram multiple evolutionary theories and personal ideas into one book, overall making the arguments unsubstantiated at times and the book difficult to follow. They also take on a (unintentional, I’m sure) condescending tone in explaining the flaws of our modern society, and do make generalizations and oversimplifications that may be offensive to some. However, if you can push past the writing/tone, there are a few arguments made in the book that justify some reflection and adoption. "

It was only after I finished the book that I found out why it felt like I was eating fish with a lot of bones.There is a lot of good material, science and interesting perspectives in this work. However, the conclusions are often binary and absolute with no room for nuance.Some books detail conclusions that arise from research. Others use research to justify the authors' conclusions. This book is the latter.Unfortunately, the authors' claim to fame today is as anti-vaxxers. Their often fringe ideas can be seen strewn throughout this book."

Although the title suggests the authors will analyze modern society based on evolutionary science, much of what is told is a loose appliance of some evolutionary principles to contemporary society, heavily mixed with opinions of the authors and viewpoints they have littlz or nothing to do with evolution. At its worst, the authors use evolutionary science to back up their opinions without it actually being applicable. The later parts of the book are especially prone to this. The content and tone is also heavily prescriptive, although they argue for open-mindedness and critical inquiry.Narration of the male author is quite grating."

I feel like their stances were science based but then they throw this approach away when it comes to political and controversial topics such as genders and sex being different. It's just felt very inconsistent and misleading, however this could be bias on my behalf. Overall interesting read worth the time but would not read again myself."

I only got halfway through before disposing of it — I usually donate books I don’t want but this one went straight into the bin (and I apologised to the bin before throwing it in).

I also dislike how this book heavily attacks any other way of thinking and modern achievements including modern medicine as some sort of evil.

I live in OLympia and have been a big fan and supporter since the 1970s.No more if they can't tolerate folks like Bret and Heather. I particularly loved their critique of our so called educational system.I liked also the focus on raising non fragile children. It is always better to let nature teach lessons. Not so much from child rearing books and so called experts. This book is worth your money because it is rooted in deep truths about our true animal natures.

These authors use science to glorify their opinions on our species’ evolution, as if culture, or language, or many facets of our society don’t also evolve. Their use of the word “weird” to describe anything that’s not white, cis, het, or first world is a glaring example. Trans people have also existed for as long as humanity, and while ignored, that history is undeniable. This book is a step away from including a chapter on Eugenics. SMH."

The authors' mastery of the subject and the approaches came out clear. However, the book is a bit too preachy for my liking. Also, the narration (I listened to the audio-book) could have been better. The authors themselves did the narration, taking turn chapter-by-chapter. Their narration was clear, especially Brett's, but was lacking in warmth, again especially Brett's. Without last two issues, it would have been a 4-star book."

Instead I got a list of “thou shalts” and “thou shalt nots” which, while somewhat based on actual evidence, merited far more exploration than they received. Even when I agreed with the authors’ vehement opining (which was really for most of the book) the rigidity of it made me want to push back and say, “Hang on, let’s actually DISCUSS that interpretation and examine other possibilities.” That did not happen. If this topic interests you, take a cultural anthropology class, or even read a textbook. You’ll get far more out of it."

So, on the subjects I was less knowledgeable about, it felt like I was getting answers. On the other hand, when I would read about a subject I was more knowledgeable about, it felt like there was a lot I disagreed with them on.

Memes must provide evolutionary advantage to genes.A reminder that exponential growth can't continue forever I believe is well deserved in consumerist era.

It is a basic overview of history and evolution. I love Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein and follow much of their content. This book was obviously aimed at a younger audience, which is their specialty and critically important. However, I was wanting some of that Heather and Bret nuance, and there wasn't space in this book to get that granular. I will save this book for my kids as they hit their teenage years, BUT I will be waiting for more deep diving lit from Bret and Heather."
297,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121133448-brennan,Rating 4 out of 5,"Very enjoyable read with really interesting topics covered. It’s something I think about alot, how technological advancements have grown faster than evolution has. But the authors do a great job at linking why we do the weird things we do with its evolutionary precursor; and they suggest ways to become aware of and work beyond this dissonance. Parts are a little preachy, but I really agree with what the authors are laying down here."
298,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7999241-hanna,Rating 2 out of 5,"I thought that this book would be in the lineage of Jared Diamond’s The World Until Yesterday. I was a bit disappointed that the book seemed to be mostly the authors’ own strong opinions, repeated ad nauseum. I did appreciate their use of the word “hyper-novel” to describe our current environment and their point that humans are as a species generalists that can thrive in any niche but as individuals tend to specialize. Overall a bit disappointing. "

Even in how I have to live with an autoimmune disease, I notice how our culture has progressed far faster than my body (our bodies) can keep up. But the writing was awful, the ""takeaways"" didn't connect at all to the chapters and there was so much left unsaid! Some good tidbits that I can use in conversation, but not worth the read. In fact I didn't finish."
300,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27355552-mike-strong,Rating 4 out of 5,"I like books that cut through the BS and go right for the primary point. Academics have a tendency to embed complex language in their writing and spend pages discussing the nuance of theory -- not this book! There are numerous chapters on hot-topic issues, like sex, gender, parenthood, childhood play, and other less political things like the importance of sleep. This is all delivered through an evolutionary perspective!"
301,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49035140-siddiq-khan,Rating 4 out of 5,"Generally very thought provoking and well written, recounting some wild adventures that make the life of modern biologists seem no less eventful than their pioneering 18th & 19th century predecessors. The views on sex and gender are very conservative, wrong-headed, and distasteful in a vulgarly mercantile fashion that reduces human romance to a cheap neodarwinian haggle of crude calculation. "
302,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1604557-sean,Rating 5 out of 5,"Not everybody is going to love this book, especially those who are heavily steeped in any sort of political belief system. It challenges every line of thinking that we picked up in our public education from a scientific (evolutionary, biological, psychological) perspective. And most people don’t like it when their beliefs are challenged. I happen to love everything about this book. I recommend it, highly, for all those who are up to the challenge."
303,no user info,Rating 2 out of 5,"I honestly did not enjoy this book. I enjoyed the first few chapters but all in all I had expected a more scientific approach to ""The challenges of Modern Life"" It didn't feel like it was written by experts but rather by ordinary people. Perhaps the authors tried to keep the level low to make it more accessible to the general public but the general public would still like to learn and understand how evolution has shaped us. "
304,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68044143-daud-yusof,Rating 4 out of 5,"Hmmmm..mixed feelings about this book. The cat is out of the bag and very unlikely things can go back the way it was.Civilization is a weird thing and we are moving closer to destruction whether we like it or not.In the Islamic tradition, the Prophet, May Peace and Blessings be upon him advise us to move to the villages and away from the city centers when the time comes. He definitely got a point there and something worth exploring."

The early chapters in the book were more valuable to me such as the chapters on medicine, food and sleep. Overall, it was a good recap of information that I sort of knew before.I listened to this book in audioform and I find that its harder for me to soak in information if I listen as opposed to reading. "
306,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3905406-tim-miller,Rating 4 out of 5,"This book is mostly common sense advise, couched in the lives, experiences, and basic theories of two biologists.The authors' argument that the mainstays of culture are a product of evolution was intriguing. I did not expect to see a common theme in this text, described by the authors as Chesterton's Fence, which reminded me of a central theme in Michael Crichton novels and the Jurassic Park film franchise. Picture Dr. Ian Malcolm saying this: Just because we can, doesn't mean we should."
307,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1297508-alexia-hall,Rating 4 out of 5,Very interesting read. I enjoyed that it set up the framework that the purpose of this book is to think while it outlines both positives and negatives of our evolutionary growth. There are examples I disagree with that I believe were not well thought out while other examples were incredibly effective. Overall I thought there were many good points made regarding what we can do better as a civilization moving forward into this next era. 
308,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33538011-bahar-almasi,Rating 3 out of 5,"I'm extending a bit of generosity with my rating for this book. My expectations were high, and I'm quite surprised by its mediocrity. While it contains some engaging insights, these are overshadowed by numerous paragraphs filled with tedious and outdated information that often lulled me to sleep. Regrettably, despite my wishes to the contrary, I cannot justify a higher rating for this book. On a positive note, their podcast offers a much more compelling experience."
309,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60367137-slick-daslickest,Rating 4 out of 5,Great read recommended to me by my big brother. Easy flowing concepts that make logical sense. Everything is connected. We belong to earth as much as earth belongs to us. Every species that is on this earth is essentially self. Our cultures and religions and the why of things hold weight. We should learn to think for our selves. And to explore and take risk that’s what life is. 
310,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5980353-k-m-laume,No Rating,Pretty interesting read (but a bit depressing in parts). I’ve been enjoying delving into evolutionary biology over the last few years as it seems to provide logical answers to things I’ve wrestled with over my lifetime. I think I probably need to read it again (and slower) as there was a lot to take in. 
311,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"One of the best books I’ve read in the last 5 yearsRequired reading for any conscientious citizen living in our age of rapid societal change. Many of these ideas I’ve suspected to be true for a while and the authors eloquent, reasoned and seasoned delivery only reinforced them for me. "
312,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78168912-jake,Rating 3 out of 5,"It's Okay. Suffers from a quest to explain everything. There are some interesting points that I wanted explained more, like the evolutionary case for monogamy, the case against pornography, and the use of culture to make rapid evolutionary claims. The hinted at the evolutionary case for free speech, this should have been expanded more. And there were other points that didn't "
313,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I expected to enjoy this book more than I did, but it was still an engaging read. My main issue is tat I think the authors could have gone into the topics they discuss with greater depth. This makes for a good self-help book or introduction to the topic, but not quite as satisfying as someone like Pinker or Ridley who drill down into topics leaving the reader lots to ponder. "
314,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"I liked how the book takes us on an analytical journey to persuade us that in order for humanity to survive, we need to engineer a steady state to persist into the future. It isn't about growth, or domination, or control, or winning, or short-term gains. It will require humanity to look at persisting and continuing as the means to go forward."
315,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12275599-katie-rybakova,Rating 5 out of 5,"A must-read. Fearless and incredibly poignant, this text articulates a truly scientific, vs. Psuedo-religion scientific, perspective on everything from sleep to education. As an educator myself I found their biological perspectives on education to be particularly thoughtful and reflective-- spot on. Their last few pages obliterate the pandemic in a way I have yet to read. Fascinating."
316,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21551242-kristine-offield,Rating 5 out of 5,"PC culture and asking legitimate questions made Heather Heying and Bret Weinstein “controversial” so I would advise that you take the 1 and 2 star ratings with a grain of salt. It’s a book about evolution written by two evolutionary biologists. If evolution, asking questions, and thinking for yourself is your bread and butter, I highly recommend. "
317,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13411345-larry-mays,Rating 5 out of 5,"Not a book for everyone, of course, and too bad for that as it contains a lot of really great insights for those of us trying to make sense of these times. How about why gathering around a fire might be important for strengthening community? The authors also have a podcast, ""Dark Horse"" which I find enlightening."
318,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/267635-james-maiorana,Rating 5 out of 5,Excellent. A self help book in a way for the individual and for humanity at large based on an evolutionary toolkit. Covers many aspects of life with appropriate depth for a book of its length and intention. I could see each chapter spawning a book of their own. I hope the author's choose to expand on each in follow up work.
319,no user info,Rating 3 out of 5,"This books is a couple of biological evolutionary scientist's lens on the human condition in the 21st century. It's nice to see a biologists perspective on human behavior. Sources would javelin been nice. A lot of predominant primary theory. I know there's not enough time for the other stuff, but the Wuhan lab correlation regarding covid at the end of the book does not determine causation.. "
320,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6812983-mark-mortensen,Rating 3 out of 5,"In this era many readers prefer fantasy over nonfiction and maybe that is why in a divided society this book has attracted polarizing reviews. The book, authored by former collegiate professors, is close to textbook form covering history and science. I found the content to interesting enough to expand my intellect. There were areas I did not agree with but overall, I did not find it polarizing. "
321,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11016034-meg-compton,Rating 5 out of 5,"It’s rare that a nonfiction book doesn’t tempt me to skim. I enjoyed this one thoroughy… no skimming. This is not a book about evolution as much as it is a guide for being human in a world where change has outpaced our ability to thoughtfully adapt and prosper. Each chapter concluded with wise, no-nonsense, realistic advice. "
322,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27678334-eric,Rating 2 out of 5,"Well, if you've ever been confused about the rationale behind anything in this world you must read this book. It turns out that evolution is the absolute answer to virtually everything in creation. It does close on the high note that the virus is just doing what it's supposed to - we are mindless food for it."
323,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33275473-christian-orton,Rating 5 out of 5,"One of the most readable and educational books I've ever read. While I believe it does have a major fault that the authors are too restricted in tying everything to science and reason, there's still so much information here to enlighten a person and improve so many areas of their life. A lot of practical wisdom. "
324,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1054712-kent-winward,Rating 4 out of 5,"I wrote about this for our non-profit Black Box Warning Initiative (blackboxwarn.org), in part because it discusses in Chapter 4 how we are biologically set up to deal (and not deal) with modern medicine.

325,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105222091-dee-goulet,Rating 5 out of 5,Absolutely a must read for anyone that wants wise advise on how to navigate the challenges faced today. Married couple Heather E Heying and Bret Weinstein do a bang up job of explaining modern issues and how to make cogent decisions that effect our species as well as the individual.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend everyone to read!
326,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"Full of interesting and useful information. While I disagree with many of the paths Heying and Weinstein use (they're evolutionary biologists who assume everything is ""adaptive"" rather than intelligently designed), they arrive at many good conclusions and have insight into a good many things the vast majority of us have never considered or are entirely blind to."
327,https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/107953029-jordan-otto,Rating 4 out of 5,"It seems obvious to me that we live in a “hyper-novel” (as the book calls it) world. But what’s to be done? Helpful to understand where we’ve come from which is the majority of this book. However more emphasis should/could have been spent on how to move past this. The last chapter, The Fourth Frontier, is a good start but it left me wanting more. Maybe another book opportunity?"
328,no user info,Rating 4 out of 5,"I really enjoyed the science and the facts that were presented. Loved the long view of humanity and how we were shaped over time. I didn't always agree with the conclusions they drew, maybe I am too much of a 21st century person- but I am glad I read this and will try to consider where we came from in making future decision. "
329,no user info,Rating 5 out of 5,"Brilliant, riveting, inspiring and thought provokingWho would think that a book on evolutionary biology could be so engaging and fun? This one certainly is! It is elegantly written, treats the reader as intelligent and caring, presents problems in a thorough way and offers hopeful ideas and solutions.Unique and exciting! "
